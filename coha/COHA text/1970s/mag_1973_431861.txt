 | THE FIRST AMENDMENT ON TRIAL @# The public needs to realize that freedom-for-me is not enough , that in fact it is nothing at all . When everybody goes to the same church and sings the same psalms , true believers must be uneasy . When loyalty oaths are heard on all sides , it is time for good citizens to sound alarms . When , within a matter of weeks , one Nixon Administration official stands up and says , " We need a vital , vigorous , and free press , " while another salutes the First Amendment as the guarantor of " a free flow and wide range of information to the public , " and a third , the Attorney General himself , pronounces freedom of speech " vital to the preservation of our society " ? watch out . The liturgical unison is made possible by the fact that this is a time of transition , a time when meanings change . The Nixon Administration can be righteous , because an older , not yet superseded , lexicon is used . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking place ? has , for the most part , taken place ? needs to be recognized . Else there is a damaging confusion . An epoch in the history of the First Amendment has ended and another has begun . The history of the First Amendment is , of course , a part of the larger , worldwide history of the conflict , which began when society began . But this part may be fairly demarcated from the rest , both in space and time . And it has a special meaning for us because it is our own history , and because , in its pe- riod , it leads the rest of the world . It started in England , in the sixteenth century , and rose , at first , from the common law . ( There had been some earlier striving , but it did n't amount to much . ) Free expression was both an issue and a weapon in the English convulsions of the seventeenth century and in the contests between the rulers and their opponents in eighteenthcentury England and America . Gains for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verbalization was general , necessarily , and the meaning of the guaranties remained to be decided . There was an early clash over the Sedition Act of 1798 ; the act expired in a couple of years , however , and freedom of speech got almost no attention for the next hundred and twenty years . The nineteenth century ( which actually lasted till World War I ) was not a period when the sweep and strength of the First Amendment were recognized and accepted ; it was rather a period when the freedom was n't tested . There was considerable diversity of opinion in the United States as a whole , but considerable suppression within communities . Mormons were free to speak their minds only in Salt Lake City , where no one else was free to . Abolitionists were gladly heard in Boston and murdered in the South . And the government had no reason to seek to silence opposition , except in time of insurrection , when the legality of its measures was scarcely challenged . Then , in the fifty years just past , came challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient  | bitter struggles have for the most part halted , won by those who took the side of freedom . The law has answered the questions that were put to it four centuries ago . Hence government men chant devotions to freedom of the press . Hence also it is sound and useful to say that an era is over . But there are new issues to resolve , and the contests are as critical as ever . The differences between the two eras do not arise from different basic values . It is still a conflict between liberty and order , between freedom and authority . The old-fashioned words , sentimentladen as they may be , remain the best , because the ultimate conflict remains the same . There is , on one side , the concept that the people should freely speak and write , and , on the other , the concept that they should speak and write only what their governors permit . But the battles are now waged over different kinds of speech , and the weaponry is different . Though the values have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our system , we seek to settle conflicts through the law , new legal issues are encountered . Historical divisions are more or less artificial and imposed , but this one less than most . There are rough edges , of course , and interpenetration , but the differences are marked , and the transition is abrupt , and the division , as historical divisions go , has unusual clarity . The changes have immediate importance . We should be aware of them right now ; they ought not to be left for retrospection . Let us take the differences in order . POLITICAL SPEECH ALONE The struggle for free speech has taken place in three fields mainly : religion , politics , and sexual morality . ' The names for the forbidden kinds of speech are , respectively , heresy , sedition , and obscenity . Heresy , which for a millennium had been a crime punishable by the secular government , ceased to be such in the eighteenth century and has never been a First Amendment problem . Obscenity , in contrast ; had not been criminal at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a crime at common law . The source of the common law , the theory goes ( and , in the main , the fact ) , is established custom , traditions so firmly fixed so long that " man 's memory runneth not to the contrary . " This particular tradition apparently had lain around unnoticed for a thousand years . As a serious impairment of free expression , the law of obscenity had a short , though vigorous , life . In a little over two centuries , the restraints it imposed on speech and @# press pretty much came to an end . The obscenity cases that now excite attention deal in essence with the question of where expression , protected by the First Amendment , ends , and where behavior , not protected , starts ? the control of action , as distinguished from expression , being the proper aim of government . ( The sternest libertarian of our justices , Hugo Black , if he were still on the bench . would probably be voting for the prosecution in some of the cases coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present time are political ? not religious , not literary . ' ' OPINION AND FACT Ask someone a question about the First Amendment and ( if he can answer it at all ) you will get an answer in terms of free expression of thought , ideas , sentiment , argument , belief , opinion ? that is , freedom of conscience , conscience expressed . In the era which has ended , that was the freedom at issue . John Milton 's Areopagitica , the first great document in this history ( and probably the greatest , despite its faults , because his writing was so damn good ) , is directed to such freedom . So is the most widely quoted modern statement , Mr. Justice Holmes 's . " The best test of truth , " he said , " is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market . " ( The figure of speech , an interesting conjunction of economic laissez-faire and intellectual freedom , had earlier been used by Jefferson . ) The first statute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was directed at ideas . The rulers were particularly alarmed by the rhymes that were going around , such as When Adam delved and Eve span Who was then the gentleman ? ( which was still a subversive battle cry a century later , at the time of the Peasants ' Revolt ) . John Wentworth incurred Elizabeth 's displeasure , fatally , for expressing his opinion of the methods of her govern -- nt . John Wilkes was prosecuted because he rid ed his betters . Peter Zenger printed insults . The Address of the Continental Congress to the Inhabitants of Quebec declared that the goal of freedom of the press was the " diffusion of liberal subjects . " Benjamin Franklin understood free speech to mean " discussing the propriety of public measures and political opinions . " Jefferson , drafting a statute f o r Virginia , began , " Whereas , Almighty God hath created the mind free . . . .  | When the First Amendment was being considered , people talked about " permitting every man to publish his opinion . . . . " Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " scores of citizens " were imprisoned for their " disapproval of the war . " As recently as 1970 , Thomas I. Emerson , in his System of Freedom of Expression , a magnificent attempt to systematize First Amendment theory which deals with all aspects of the subject , put his introductory statement of the fundamental issue in terms of " beliefs and opinions ... belief , opinion , and communication of ideas . " But the issue thus cast has been decided . There is no opinion whose statement the law forbids . This does not mean , of course , that all use of words is lawful . Commanding another person to commit a criminal act is not protected by the First Amendment . Neither is transmission of secrets to the nation 's enemy . Nor intentional falsehood ? in business dealings , in advertising , in attack on reputation . But the intellectual product that most of the fight was all about is free . In the middle 1950s , even while Joseph McCarthy had Washington under siege , the justices , in the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made clear that expression of ideas ? even the idea that the government ought to be overthrown by violence ? was not itself a crime , and under the First Amendment could not be made a crime . There is something else , however , crucial to the First Amendment . It is communication of fact . Not opinion , not belief , not ideas , but fact ; not release of what is inside one 's head , but transmission of external data . Even though it has up to now played so small a part in the history of free speech , even though it was scarcely in the minds of those who drafted the Bill of Rights , it is crucial to that document 's purposes . Freedom to communicate objective fact , ignored in most First Amendment formulation , is now a central issue . Factual information was the subject of the case of the Pentagon Papers , and , though the prosecution would not have it so , of its criminal aftermath . It is the stated goal of journalists who resist grand jury subpoenas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight . The subpoenas are not concerned with secret sources of opinion . Neither are the reporters , who want to dig out facts . Again , a former CIA man , Victor L. Marchetti , seeks to publish a book about what went on in the CIA . The CIA , and , so far , the courts , do not think he ought to , without a check on whether he is divulging " classified information . " Nobody , suggests he may not publish his opinion of the CIA . It is not that factual statement was never an issue in the struggles of the earlier era . Parliament in the 1770s tried to stop John Wilkes from printing its proceedings ( tried , and then conceded ) . But that was an exceptional item among a hundred contests over the publishing of comment . ( Civil ac- tions for defamation are ordinarily concerned with fact , but until recently such actions never involved the First Amendment and rarely public matters . ) The earliest important application of the First Amendment to factual material came in 1945 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain practices of the Associated Press . ( The A.P . cited the First Amendment as sanctioning its freedom to pick and choose its customers ; the Court cited the First Amendment too , but just the other way . ) And even there , though almost all of what the A.P . sold was factual information , the justice who paid most attention to the First Amendment referred to " news and views . " There is striking evidence of the shift in the changing role of the congressional investigating committee . From the 1930s through the 1950s , it was on the side of suppression ; one of its purposes was to silence or inhibit radical opinion . Now , less than twenty years later , the investigating committee has , so far as those who favor free expression are concerned , undergone metamorphosis from villain into hero . The Senate tries to pry information out of an unwilling Executive and present it to the public . Instead of stifling free expression , the committees , by and large , promote it . And the target of investigation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just at the moment when freedom to express opinion has become fairly well established , the need for factual information has become vastly more important . Enabling the people to make the right political decisions is generally considered the main reason for a system of free expression ( though it is not the only one ) , and to arrive at such decisions the people must have access to the facts , facts that have to do with how the country is being run , what grievances exist , the wisdom and justice of conflicting policies . In centuries past , the facts were decently apparent ; what was needed , and what the government opposed , was comment on the facts . Now we are free to comment , but the facts are hard to find . Society has grown much larger and more complex ? in its technology , its economics , and its politics ? and , reflecting the society , so has our government . There are many more relevant facts today than there were in 1600. in 1700 , in 1800 , even in 1940 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts are buried in the multiple creases of this complicated culture . Nor has our government in recent years wanted us to find them . Abraham Lincoln could truthfully say , in his Second Inaugural Address , " The progress of our arms . . . is as well known to the public as to myself . " The present Administration finds the Address embarrassing . The progress of our arms , as in the case of the Pentagon Papers , is regarded by the Executive as something to conceal . And Lincoln 's famous aphorism must presently be questioned . It is now possible to fool all of the people all of the time , or at least so many of them for so long a time that the remnant does n't matter . Lincoln was expressing faith in the people 's ultimate good sense , but good sense can not be exercised without the facts to work on . The First Amendment , having served one purpose well , now has another one before it . THE BULLHORN AND THE KAZOO While the information needed has become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become constricted . One side of the First Amendment is to assure that facts will not be hidden , and that those who have them will be free to speak . Another is to make it possible for the speakers to be heard . Libertarians have recently claimed with some success , though the claim has been opposed , that the guaranties of speech and press include the right to hear and read , which may levy something of a strain on the " absolute " view that the First Amendment should be taken literally . But the point is sound : we can put it in terms of the speaker 's right to be heard and the writer 's to be read , and the outcome is the same . The amendment must extend that far , or the guaranties are nonsense . Talking to oneself is hardly the principal function of the faculty of speech ; a press does not exist so that the printer will have something to read . The amendment has to do with both utterance and receipt . Receipt by whom ? So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the primary audience consists of those who exert . or have a chance to exert , power over government . When the earlier epoch began , toward the end of the sixteenth century , that was a very small group . It consisted of the nobility , the gentry , and the more substantial burgesses . It was easy to reach the entire audience ; they could be spoken to , directly or indirectly , in Parliament . The earliest form of free expression that was won was freedom of speech in Parliament . There " was still no freedom to speak outside of Parliament , and no freedom of press at all . But the parliamentary privilege served its purpose well . The audience was convinced , and went out to work a revolution . The channel of communication was broad enough because the audience was narrow . A century and a half later , in America , expression had grown freer , both because of the movement of the law in the intervening time and because of the intervening distance from the crown . And the body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group ; the gentry and the burgesses , much more than earlier in England . needed the help of others . But the others could be reached . People in towns assembled to hear addresses . Anyone who owned or could hire a press could turn out printed matter . There was a flood of pamphlets , broadsides , newspapers ; even almanacs carried political argument . The population was put in a roil by the speeches and the literature . The American Revolution resulted ; it could not have otherwise . The situation is altogether different now . The population of seventeenth-century England was about - five million , give or take a million or so . The position of rebellious America was perhaps two-thi , of that . The present population of the United States exceeds two hundred million . And it is not population alone that counts . A far larger proportion of the total is involved . Those who ultimately have the political power are all those who can vote . Not only those who do , but those who may , since they can exercise their power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced by the number that stays home . There are one hundred and forty million people in America who are eligible to vote . It is this vast audience that needs to hear the facts if our system is to work ( and argument , too : the new importance of facts does not negate the importance of opinion ) . They can be reached  | through television , radio , newspapers , magazines , and books . The older methods will not do . Speeches in the Senate and the House are significant only to the extent that they are heard outside the Capitol . Assemblies of the people , when they deal with national issues , are usually groups that already share a point of view and gather to applaud their own ideas . The kind of citizens ' meeting that constitutes a forum ? which deliberates and arrives at judgments , judgments that have effect on what is done ? usually works on local matters only . Pamphlets and broadsides ? those justly honored instruments of political expression ? hardly exist today . Handbills serve chiefly to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects are read by a pitifully small fraction of the population . Books are influential , but they can not function politically in themselves ; the ideas and information they contain reach the broad electorate only indirectly . They affect political decision only by affecting the views of those who have the chance to speak through other media . ( Two spectacular instances of the effect of books on politics ? Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring and Ralph Nader 's Unsafe at Any Speed ? are typical . These two touched special nerves ; their evident common sense had an ally in deep fantasy , which could cut across diverse economic and political strata . In the one case , our fear of poison was excited , and drove quite disparate elements to the ecological banner . As for the other , Americans are easily aroused by intimations of infidelity on the part of their mistress the motor car . ) The effective media require large accumulations of capital and rely on commercial advertising . It is not necessary to repeat the sad story of the diminution of those threatened species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps needs emphasis ? for those who live in the larger cities ? is the indifference , if not hostility , of most American newspapers to serious discussion of public issues . And even in the larger cities , which have some very good papers , there are fewer and fewer competing voices . @# And most Americans browse on even more arid grounds . They get their news mostly from television . Television news is admirable on occasion . It provides an informative supplement we never had before : pictures of people 's faces , which often tell us more than the words they use , sometimes even contradict the words . But television news is narrow and skimpy , in relation to events . And what one sees in a few metropolitan centers is usually a good deal more than what appears on the many local stations . So the news is not good . And it could be worse . It could be worse because its control is concentrated in a few hands . It is startling ( or would be , @# except we are used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a democracy get their news ? information that they must have in order to run their country ? is a form of private property . An expensive form : it takes a large accumulation of capital to operate a major paper or a television station . A few outstanding papers , and , sporadically , the networks , have been acting well , even bravely . But it is only the character of those who happen now to manage them that accounts for the blessings we have . We feed on the largesse of Lord and Lady Bountiful , and their heirs may be quite different . The few pieces of private property that constitute the media could pass to other hands . At the moment , most of the great papers and the networks - seem to be partial to freedom , and the government , which inveighs against them , seems devoted to suppression . But liberals might think back a way : substitute Franklin Roosevelt for Richard Nixon , and William Randolph Hearst and Colonel Bertie McCormick for the editors of the New York Times , the Washington Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a couple of other papers . And have a helping from the present time of higher journalistic standards : This past December , 151 employees of the New York Daily News tried to place an advertisement in the paper for which they worked , calling on the President to make  | peace in Southeast Asia . The News refused to run the ad . This was not government censorship of the press ; it was censorship by the press . The Times , we may note , reported the occurrence , but that was hardly a remedy . The statement was meant to reach not the readers of the Times , but quite another audience : the readers of the News , some of whom might give heed to the opinion of those whose by-lines they respect . We have an oligarchical press , and oligarchs need not always be benign . Whatever their performance , television , newspapers , radio , and a few magazines are the main sources of Americans ' information and opinion . They are severely limited in number , electromagnetically in the case of television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be heard , you must own one of them or be the owner 's invited guest . Freedom of speech , regarded as the Founding Fathers regarded it , freedom from suppressive laws , adequate to its time , can be an all too theoretical right in the present situation . If I have a bullhorn and you have a kazoo , it does n't matter a whole hell of a lot that the government suppresses neither of us . Your muffled mumblings ca n't compete with my blaring declarations . What ought to be done about it ? " Should there be legislation in aid of free expression ? Should the law intercede to prevent a possible corner in the famous market of ideas ? The First Amendment is a negative injunction : " Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . . Should Congress make some laws in aid of it ? The circumstances being now utterly different from what they were in 1789 , should we have legislation affirmatively granting access to the media ? In a small way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative efforts is the " fairness doctrine . " It requires broadcasters to give " adequate " coverage to public issues and to take care that the coverage " accurately reflects the opposing views . " But the " doctrine " is difficult to enforce , @# and its effects have hardly been substantial . The principal sanction is the power of the FCC to refuse to renew the station 's license , a power rarely exercised . Moreover , the ground on which the Supreme Court has upheld the legislation is that the number of broadcast frequencies is physically limited , reasoning which does not extend to the printing press . The Court ignored the more significant fact that broadcasting is economically limited ? as is the operation of an influential newspaper or generalcirculation magazine . New York City has four daily papers ( including the Wall Street Journal ) and ten television stations ( including UHF ) . And remember that a television station , unlike a printed publication . can accommodate only one speaker at a time . Economics , not electromagnetics , poses the problem . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now perhaps the most influential of the media ) to distinguish broadcasting from the rest of the press . Should such legislation go further , then , apply more forcibly and to all the press ? Should more of the television wasteland be brought under cultivation ? Should newspapers be compelled to open their columns ( within some reasonable limits that would have to be determined ) to all who would be heard ? That means government regulation of the press , which is a disturbing thought . But would not the First Amendment 's prohibitions be available to prevent such regulation , intended to enlarge free speech , from becoming suppressive control ? Nevertheless , if it is a good idea at all , it does not seem a good idea right now , given the current state of the press and the current state of the government . St. Augustine 's prayer for himself might be the best prescription for our media : someday , perhaps , they should be made chaste , but not just yet . GUARDING THE GOVERNMENT , GUARDING THE PEOPLE Laws inhibiting freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were meant to preserve the power of the government . The rs wanted no opposition , no blame , no criticism . In the beginning , there was not much difference between treason and sedition . The latter , which became a body of law relating to words ( " seditious libel " ) , included kinds of conduct ( " insurrection " ) . The former , which our Constitution confines to acts , once included words . And even thought : it was treason to " compass the death of the king " ? that is , in the language of the time , to imagine it . When the first ten amendments , the Bill of Rights , were put before the new United States , the argument was made that the addition was unnecessary because the rights dealt with were implicit . Except for treason : the crime had been so broad that the framers had written in the body of  | the Constitution a provision limiting it to defined particular acts . That was what suppression of speech and press had as its end : keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Blame of the government " was the test of sedition . In the nineteenth century , English judges were still declaring it criminal ? indeed , " unconstitutional " ? for anyone outside of Parliament to " cry down the establishment of the country , " to utter words that had " the tendency " to " breed hatred against the government . " ( The quotations are from the trials of Leigh Hunt , who criticized the use of flogging in the British army , and of John Drakard , Hunt 's publisher . Each was prosecuted for sedition , and though the judges were consistent , one jury ? that institution in which liberals traditionally put so much trust ? convicted Drakard who printed the essay and another acquitted Hunt who wrote it . ) At the present time , the free-speech issues are , in taw , not between the government and its opponents , but between different policies of and for the people . It is not , in law , the government seeking to maintain itself in power but the government adjusting the interplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists have resisted subpoenas present precisely such a conflict ( whatever else they may involve ) . The newsmen say their sources should be concealed , else transmitting information to the public , an obvious social good , will be unduly hampered . The government says the sources should be disclosed , for a variety of reasons . Although much of the press , protesting , treats it all as a single issue , the cases are not alike . The case of Earl Caldwell of the New York Times involved the identity of informants , from whom the government , suspecting crime , would also like information . In the case of Paul Branzburg of the Louisville Courier-Journal , the government wanted to know not something he was told but something he had witnessed . The case of Peter Bridge of the now defunct Newark News did not involve violation of a confidence ; he simply took the position that he should not be asked about things he had decided not to write about ( and the subject was corruption ) . In private libel and slander actions , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not prevail unless he proves not only that the attack on him is false but also that the defendant knew it was false , or came very close to knowing ? in effect , that the defendant was a deliberate , malicious liar . It seems unfair to permit the defendant to escape responsibility by saying , " I had a basis for my statement but I will not tell you what it is ; just take my lying word for it . " Yet the journalist who is sued for libel may be acting in great good faith : he relied , reasonably , on what he was told ; he could get the information only by accepting it in confidence ; and what he reported was a matter of the public concern . What William Farr reported in the Los Angeles  | Herald-Examiner was trivial , an appeal to voyeurism in a matter of no political consequence ( the Manson murder trial ) , and all the court asked of him was which of a group of lawyers had violated an order designed to assure fair trial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeopardize fair trial ; there is little public value in making it easy to publish Farr 's kind of article . In contrast , Harvard Professor Samuel Popkin , subpoenaed before a Boston grand jury in the Ellsberg case , refused disclosure in a matter of the greatest consequence . Think about the lawrespecting procedure that he followed , how little he withheld , and the service to public understanding of the kind of confidence he sought to guard . ( Popkin appeared several times before the Boston grand jury ; some of the reporters refused even to appear before the grand juries that summoned them . Having testified in detail that he had no information about possession or distribution of the Pentagon Papers , Popkin refused to answer two questions he felt were not only- speculative , but would compromise his confidential relationships with government sources he interviewed in the course of his scholarly research . ) His punishment is hard to understand , particularly in a federal circuit with an appellate bench as intelligent as the one that handled his case . The judges of the lower courts ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court 's decision in the group of cases known by Caldwell 's name worse than it really was . The newspapers and the reporters argued that newsmen should not be made to testify except where the prosecution shows " compelling necessity " for disclosure . Four justices voted for the prosecution ; four voted for the reporters . This made the opinion of the ninth ? Mr. Justice Powell ? the best indicator of the meaning of the decision . His opinion , roughly , was that the shoe is on the other foot : the witness must appear and state his objections to the questions , and should be excused from testifying if he convinces the court that he ought not to . It furnished a precedent that should have led to Popkin 's release , not to his imprisonment.4 52 Despite the differences in the cases , the law proceeds in each of them with ostensible good purpose . Aid is sought in the difficult task of dealing with crime under a system designed to protect the innocent . If we had a system under which those ir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be no need of legal evidence and n. grand jury problems . In any event , here again we have a significant change . Where once the courts , in the cases that lay behind the First Amendment , dealt with challenges to the power of the rulers , now they deal with competing desiderata ? free press versus enforcement of the criminal law , free press versus national security , free press versus malicious damage to individual reputation , free press versus fair trial And in all of this keep in mind the sanctimony tk which the press is liable . Journalists ? like doctors . lawyers , film producers , football coaches ? tend to confuse their personal desires with the common weal . Is it the worth of the First Amendment , or some personal ambition , that motivates the bold reporter ? We are all vulnerable to the confusion . most of all the lawyer involved in First Amendment issues ( such as the writer of this article ) who adds the habit of advocacy to the other obstructions to clear-sighted view . The opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's concurrence ) was in my opinion wrong ; it hinders the dissemination of the news . And the decision creates a need for legislation , which in itself is bad . Constitutional rights should not depend on legislation . What Congress grants Congress can cancel , and the First Amendment was written to protect minority views , not things that a majority can agree upon . But the argument for total immunity can not be sustained . There are situations where the need to know is so important , and the news involved so trivial , that the newsman 's privilege ought to give way to other purposes of the Bill of Rights . Ponder the case where the privilege works against the rights of an individual defendant . And take a final example : suppose the crime is corruption in high places , and the jot- - alist is one whose career depends on being . come in high places . Exceptions may require courts to draw a line , and even though judges themselves sometimes say it ca n't be done . they do it all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immunity for newsmen , then . should be the rule and if an exception is to be made , the burden of proving its necessity should be on the government . THE OUTLAW GOVERNMENT In the earlier era , as I have said , the government suppressed adverse opinion in order to shelter its power . That was the open rationale ; that a as , in general , the law . Now the law has changed . Suppression is forbidden except ( and rarely then ) Ln aid of public policy . This is now the law . But suppose you have an cutlaw government . Things having grown as complicated as they are , it is possible for a government : t'elf unlawful to seek old ends in new disguises . It . : an make believe it serves the people when in fact serves itself . It can purport to deal with the problem of access to the media when in fact it ' ceks to control them . It can pay tribute to free , iom of opinion while it chokes the passage to the facts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by principles and people , not wholly by one or the other . The familiar pair:fig of opposites ? government-of-laws or government-of-men ? does not present a clean division . We normally have both at once . Rules of law are abstractions , general propositions that include a multiplicity of instances and ? necessarily ? work awkwardly with respect to some of them . There is no Automatic Magic Set of Dandy Propositions . It takes good men to make them work . Or at least , and quite literally , it takes fairly decent men . Not that principles are unimportant . Some are clearly better than others . " Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech " is better than " No citizen shall speak ill of the government . " But given the good grants of our Bill of Rights , we need rulers to apply them . That is , rulers who respect the law and have regard for freedom . The two go naturally together . Law is the condition of freedom . The alternatives to a legal system are , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , anarchy . The denial of freedom in the former is obvious to us all . Anarchy has , however , an initial sound of freedom . Anthony Burgess , accurately , presents " the belief that man can be governed and yet be free " as a belief not widely held , indeed as something quirky . But if it were not for the intervention of the law , anybody with better muscles than you could quite easily make you shut up . So if we would have freedom , we must have law , and a government that enforces the law not only upon its citizens but also upon itself . The " government " for present purposes is the Executive . Congress has not lately sought suppression . The Judiciary , by and large , has been at the forefront of freedom . Well ahead , it must be said , of the mass of the people themselves : our citizens find the First Amendment a rather remote abstraction . For the average man , freedom of speech The First Amendment on Trial means freedom-for-me , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popes and revolutionaries . An outlaw government has two ways to take advantage of the citizens ' failure to understand that freedom is entire . One way recognizes the legal forms , and abuses them . The other demeans and disregards the law : it indulges the practices of corruption , it seeks to set clowns on judges ' benches , it uses its force in violation of constitutional provisions . For the first , where once , opposed to free expression ; there were statutes and judge-made law enforced in open court , we now have perversion of judicial process , impositions on the courts themselves , and legislative proposals that have a calculated double meaning . The Executive can pretend to prosecute criminal acts when in fact it wishes to silence dissent ( the trial of Spock , for example ) . It can pretend concern for national security when in fact it wants to keep things secret not from the enemy but from the citizens ( the case of the Pentagon Papers ) . It can use the processes of the criminal law for purposes of harassment ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aftermath ) . It can address itself to the problem of making room for voices , and , announcing an effort to broaden channels of communication , try to narCuckoo ! There it is again ! row them instead ( the proposals put forth through Clay T. Whitehead , director of the White House Office of Telecommunications Policy ) . In pursuit of the second way , the Executive can use its vast extrajudicial powers , or threaten it will use them . The publisher of a tract that speaks against the government will not be drawn and quartered ( as he would have been in the time of Good Queen Bess ) , but there is much that the Executive can give and much the Executive can take away , if it has a mind to . Jawboning , arm-twisting , bad enough in economic matters , are deadly in the world of First Amendment freedoms . The current extralegal assault is unprecedented and ironic in an Administration that arrived in Washington preaching law and order . Jefferson complained about the press ( and , unlike the present Administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances and the time , his reaction was a mild one ; he did not use the powers of his office to try to shape the press , nor did he threaten to . Neither did FDR , who battled a hostile press with the technology given him by radio and the grace given him by God ( a convenience not available to all ) . In the decade past , it has become the settled law that official interference with free expression , except by judgment of a court , is a violation of the First Amendment . The rule has been developed in obscenity cases . Thus the police may not use the threat of prosecution to force booksellers to close their shelves to books the police deem harmful , even though those books might be held unlawful after a litigation . Nor may the suppression be accomplished by steps taken in aid of a pending prosecution legitimate in itself . The district attorney of one of the largest counties in the nation ? a considerable official ? was made the subject of injunction in such a situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized most of the copies of a magazine he was prosecuting . A three-judge federal court directed him to give them back , even though ( for reasons that had nothing to do with the merits ) this meant the end of prosecution , before there could be a trial on the question of obscenity . If the district attorney had persisted in his initial course , he would have been sent to jail . ( He did not persist , of course , but abided by the law 's command . ) The same considerations are pertinent whether the crime charged is obscenity or something else : if what the government does in aid of prosecution impinges on free speech , we have a First Amendment issue . It would be strange if the principles that the courts have announced where artistic effort was involved did not apply with equal strength to political expression . There are differences , of course . The seizure of publications is one thing and the questioning of witnesses another . But it is not that the government must always lose ; it is rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of prosecution . it is present in the others . The government must expect to be remitted to less efficient method , where the ordinary mode of doing things ma% bruise the First Amendment values . That has to do with cases such as Caldwell , Popkin , Ellsberg . The even more important parallel has to do with situations where there is no pending legal case ? where the Executive proceeds again , : free speech without calling on the courts . The police chief threatening the local bookstore is actin no more unlawfully than the Vice President of the United States threatening whole sections of the press Each , without warrant in law , attacks rights granted by the First Amendment . Each brandishes mightv weapons ? the one arrest and prosecution , the other the many kinds of pressure that the Executive can bring to bear . The analogy is exact , except in two respects : what the Vice President does is more dangerous to the Constitution ; and there has not been devised , as yet , a way to bring him into court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pretty good . Our present channels of communication are not open enough , but the are , in significant numbers , pretty independent . The main trouble is a government that has no respect for either . Take two small and sharp examples . Clay Whitehead has said , in an interview . that he is " no expert in communications . " Harrold Carswell , Nixon 's defeated nominee for the Supreme Court , is no expert in the law . Our Executive would consign the delicate problems of communication to the one , and put the other in a position to decide whether the outcome is legal . It is quite possible for a government of such character to subvert the Constitution . Possible , but not inevitable . The courts are reassuring . Consider the liberal alarm in the case of Spock and his alleged co-conspirators , in the case of the Chicago Seven , in the case of the Pentagon Papers , and then consider the judicially imposed conclusion of each case . Not perfect , but quite impressive , and a demonstration that the Executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not do it all themselves . 1 ney need the aid of the Congress , which has shown it can meet the occasion ; the Administration put " conservatives " on the Court . but it was forced to accept real judges , which s -- tire critical thing ( as should have been obvious at the time , and as decisions are gradually proving ) . They need the aid of the press itself . A press that does n't want freedom terribly much is most unlikely to get it . Beyond all these lies the power of the people , who can control the government , and will , if ? and only if ? things are made clear to them . They need the information , they need to realize what they have at stake . They must understand that freedom-for-me is not enough , that in fact it is nothing at all .
