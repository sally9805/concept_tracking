txt Letters Toward an Equitable Medical Care System To the Editor : It would have helped clarify matters in connection with " income-related consumer cost-sharing " if Laurence Seidman had pursued his analogy of the lunch bill to medical care costs a bit further Op-Ed March 27 . It has always puzzled me why economists assume that the average person is wildly enthusiastic about seeking and consuming medical care ( sickness is such fun ! ) , ignoring the obvious fact that the sick person does n't pick his place or kind of treatment , just pays for it . How eliminating the protection of full insurance coverage against the cruel and frightening costs of unanticipated and unwanted medical care will benefit the poor , the uneducated , those with limited access to medical care services or access only to limited services is inexplicable . The finest restaurants ! The most expensive lunches ! Additional gallows humor might be drawn from contemplation of the average American , with a $10,000 medical bill ( a not unusual circumstance these days ) , being asked to pay with the glib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next income tax statement . How should doctors face up to the patient who says he wants cheaper medical care or the same medical care more cheaply ? What a ludicrous farce could be designed for Peter Sellers or George C. Scott in a revised version of their hospital pictures , addressing a patient with comments on the bill . Let 's cut the fat and not the meat . Medical care prices are out of control because there is no systematic way of obtaining or delivering medical care services . Rigorous public control pf hospitals , serious attention to alternatives to institutional care , salaried physicians and a universal , compulsory national medical service will do more to provide an equitable medical care system ? satisfying to patients , and without the present monstrous inflation ? than an economist 's textbook gimmick . In the adjoining column , by Richard Trubo , where the doom of the British National Health Service is foretold , one might note the single curious statistic he quotes , as an answer to Mr. Seidman . Trubo notes that after 30 years , in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it necessary to buy any insurance at all ! And Britain 's rate of medical care inflation over the years is half ours ! With luck , Congress and some national administration will discover that the way to achieve a more suitable and satisfactory health and medical care service is by transforming the medical care system and not by manipulating economic theories . GEORGE A. SILVER , M.D. Professor of Public Health Yale University School of Medicine New Haven , April 6 , 1979 Need for Military Security in the Mideast // Sue Coe Atom 's Rosy Future To the Editor : Now that President Carter has had his picture taken at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant and everyman 's granny , Ralph Nader , has exhibited his chronic state of anxiety on television , the engineers can get things running again for the benefit of present and future generations . The atomic energy program is not going to fail because of the accident at Three Mile Island ; it is going to succeed because of it . No doubt , the fearmongers and the doubters will make hay while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arisen in full force when early man first began to use fire to his advantage . ) But the doubters will slowly disappear . As Max Planck , Nobel prize winner in physics , said , " A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents , but because its opponents die , and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it . " HENRY D. FAIRLIE Montclair , N.J. , April 3 , 1979 Self-Serving Deduction To the Editor : When I read your recent editorial on " The Senate 's $16,375 Raise " I became convinced once and for all that those who so nobly claim to be in the business of public service are really in the business of self-service . If , as you indicate is possible , the members of the House of Representatives actually succeed in giving themselves a $50-a-day income tax deduction because they have to live in Washington , then those of us who have to work in places not entirely to our liking ought to get at least the same deduction . GEORGE H. TILGHMAN New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chairman of SANE 's New York Council , wonders why , after the Egypt-Israel peace treaty has been signed , it is necessary for the United States to sell $2 billion of military equipment to each country letter March 28 . Can it be that Mr. Schwartz is so naive about conditions still existing in the Middle East ? To Egypt 's west is Libya , whose ruler , Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi , has vowed to overthrow President Sadat because of his rapprochement with Israel . Libya , in 1977 , fought a border war with Egypt , and until recently was heavily committed in Uganda , attempting to save Idi Amin . Such a record demonstrates that Libya is not a force for reason and moderation in Arab-Islamic diplomacy . To Israel 's north are Syria and Iraq , two of the most vociferous supporters of the Arab " rejectionist front . " Now that Egypt , the major Arab military power , has withdrawn as a confrontation state , these two have become the significant threat to stability in the region . The stumbling block to peace in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security . Egypt and Israel 's ability to carry on the peace process successfully is dependent upon The Great Peacemaker To the Editor : President Carter said upon his return from the Middle East : " The effort would have been worth making regardless of the outcome . In war , we offer our lives as a matter of routine . We must be no less daring , no less steadfast in the pursuit of peace . " And speaking at the treaty signing ceremonies , he said that peace was something that should be vigorously and aggressively waged . I believe that these two statements deserve very serious reflection . Mr. Carter must be given credit for being one of the great peacemakers of modern history . For the Camp David summit , and the President 's eventual journey to the Middle East , which culminated in the Egyptian-Israeli treaty , may be compared with any initiative taken by Dag Hammarskjold or any of his successors at the post of United Nations Secretary General , or with any peace initiative by any President of the United States or by anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for those who are of a humanist and liberal orientation to stand up and defend the President rather than to mouth the platitudes about his being incompetent or weak . And it is time that we all recognized Carter as being one of the great Presidents of the century . WILLIAM JAMES MARTIN New York , April 4,1979 their capacity to maintain their security against those who violently oppose that process . In an ideally sane world , peace would be accompanied by demobilization and disarmament . In a volatile area such as the Middle East , where sanity is not necessarily a qualification for national leadership , military security remains a prerequisite for maintaining peace . ADAM Simms Little Neck , N.Y. , April 8,1979 To Spend for Peace To the Editor : At first I was annoyed that we should be asked to pick up a hefty portion of the tab for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt . I joined the swelling chorus murmuring against it . Five billion dollars ! Then I thought some more . We spent $5 billion in just two months during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we will spend any amount to prosecute a war and resent each cent for the sake of peace . G. S. FELL Atlantic Highlands , N.J. , Mar.28 , 1979 Tribute to Bhutto To the Editor : That Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was hanged is both shattering and nearly inconceivable . One thought him indestructible , so overpowering was his energy , warmth and capacity to love . His buoyant vitality , his deep faith in uplifting all those lives he touched . For nearly three decades he had been at the forefront of every political and economic struggle for his country , instilling a sense of confidence and duty , of commitment to the values in which he believed so deeply . It pains me very much to see the life of a patriot come to such an end . Who could have believed that Mr. Bhutto , who worked so hard to abolish such a system , would ultimately become a victim of the same system . I fail to understand that in times like these when man has made such great strides in all directions there are people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful retribution . Eye for an eye ? if that 's the judicial code of an Islamic republic in which a dictatorship is trying to perpetuate its disregard for the human rights of its people through these primitive ideologies , I say it 's time to stand up and have your voices heard . And once and for all crush all these hypocritical laws to the ground . At least , in this way , efforts of a leader wo n't have been in vain , and there will be an end to these unjustified cruelties . RAJEEV MEHTA New York , April 5 , 1979 Benefits of a Bankers ' Trade Zone in New York City To the Editor : I read with interest Prof. Albert Gailord Hart 's reservations about the bankers ' trade zone ( letter March 24 ) . I approached the Federal Reserve some five years ago about the possibility of establishing a " bankers ' trade zone " in New York City , because at that time the atmosphere for such a project was ripe . At the present time , the Eurodollar or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , a practice which has brought prosperity to such areas as the Cayman Islands , the Bahamas and the London financial community . Since New York is the financial center of the world , why do we permit the so-called " offshore " activities to move to London and thus make London in many respects almost more important than New York ? Why should an American bank retain accounting firms and trust companies in the Bahamas and Cayman Islands and permit them to carry the books for transactions which are actually concluded in New York ? No doubt , bringing the offshore activities of American banks to a socalled " offshore " zone in New York City might create a number of supervisory problems . That is why the Federal Reserve is so carefully studying and discussing this area . The Federal Reserve will find it very difficult to oppose a bankers ' trade zone here after the state banking department , the U.S. Treasury and the Legislature have approved such a move . I am certain the banking department of New York State considered very carefully the ramifications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervisory authorities before they decided to favor it . At the present time , American banks are spending millions of dollars abroad to pay foreigners to maintain facilities and records for transactions which are actually directed and handled by officers of American banks at the head offices . The creation of a bankers ' trade zone would eliminate these expenditures and , in a small way , help our balance of payments ? and also create additional employment in the United States . Actually , it is not dignified for respectable American banks to set up quasi-banking operations on small islands , such as the Grand Cayman Islands and the Bahamas , in order to avoid or circumvent the Federal Reserve Q regulations and reserve requirements . Why should n't these transactions , which incidentally run into billions of dollars , be handled in New York ? A bankers ' trade zone would not only make it easier , and possibly cheaper , for the banks to supervise the handling of the transactions , but it would also be beneficial for the country . The Federal Reserve has the staff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to supervise , if such supervision is necessary . I hope that the Federal Reserve in the near future will come out with the required approval and follow the paths of the New York State Banking Department , Albany Legislature and the United States Treasury in making a bankers ' trade zone possible .
