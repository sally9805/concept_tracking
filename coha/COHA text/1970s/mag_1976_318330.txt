Cool Dixie <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> I applaud the special issue of TIME on " The South Today " Sept. 27 . <P> You made an excellent assessment of what makes a " new " Southerner a " real " Southerner . Perhaps until now I did n't know and thought no one cared . <P> <P> Anne Cavin Walters Hampton , Ga . <P> Your issue was a delight , but in all those pages on the glorious emergence of the South , there was only the briefest nod toward the reason why we 're booming down here . If it were n't for air conditioning , the South would be uninhabitable , by modern standards , for six to nine months of the year . <P> <P> Eleanor B. Pierce Tampa , Fla . <P> How Dare You ? <P> Who do you people think you are " discovering " the South ? Patting us on the back because Faulkner rose a phoenix from our ashes ? Because Carter plays the erudite Good Ole Boy ? Because you have finally noticed the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <P> <P> Ann Goette Distler Donaldsonville , La . <P> Smell Dem Magnolias <P> Paul Gray observes that " Southern writing today ... seems stalled between the glorious past and an uncertain future . The past ... has become a burden to its inheritors . " <P> TIME reports that movie moguls have hired Anne Edwards , a non-Southerner , to write the genesis for a sequel to Gone With the Wind , the alltime " mules and mansions " novel . <P> <P> No matter how far the Old South recedes into shadow and dust , the money seekers will always pull back the Faulknerian mansions and moss to show the glorious past . Y'all smell dem magnolias , honey ? Edgar H. de Lesseps Arlington , Va . <P> <P> The Southern Language <P> You have opened up a Pandora 's box with your comments on the rich and colorful expressions of the South . The one sticking in my mind since my Army duty in Georgia is : " You 're as nervous as a long-tailed cat at a rocking-chair convention . " <P> Franklin Gottman Waterford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mule eatin ' briars as I read this issue . Ann Viamonte Dallas <P> Add to the similes : fine as frogs ' hair . <P> Frederic N. Home Virginia Beach , Va . <P> <P> I Ca n't Go Back <P> I testify with your Bonnie Angelo that Southerners never really leave . But I ca n't go back-until perhaps they improve the ski slopes back home , and the Chinook and steelhead run the Bayou Pierre . The Yankee life has been too good . <P> Jefferson Davis Miller III Camas , Wash . <P> All this Georgia girl can say after reading " The South Today " is ' Oh , Lord , I wan na go home ! " <P> Thanks for the most unbiased writing I 've seen lately . <P> Joan Smith Cole Monroe , Conn . <P> You forgot to report on the tar-paper shacks and the many thousands of acres of undeveloped wasteland . Now how about one on the Midwest and Ford Country , y'all ? <P> Frank Gregory Kokomo , Ind . <P> Your issue gave us a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New South a present of our federal funds , brains , brawn and jobs .
