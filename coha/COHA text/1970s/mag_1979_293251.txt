A special prosecutor may have to probe the Jordan affair <P> Did Hamilton Jordan really snort cocaine on that 1978 visit to Manhattan 's far-out Studio 54 ? The possibility is growing stronger that a special prosecutor will have to be appointed to investigate the evening 's entertainment enjoyed by the White House chief of staff . Under the stringent provisions of the 1978 Ethics in Government Act , there may be no other way to determine whether it is Jordan or his accusers who are telling the truth . <P> Two new witnesses turned up last week . One , a show business public relations agent named Barry Landau , provided the first corroboration of part of the story - though not the crucial part - told by lawyers for Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager , two own ers of the celebrated disco . They are under indictment for tax evasion , and Schrager has also been charged with possession of cocaine . The White House has accused them of concocting false charges against Jordan in order to bargain for leniency . Landau , who said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such obvious ax to grind , though he is a crony of Rubell 's . Said he , in a sworn statement given to the FBI : <P> " I was at Studio 54 when I ran into Hamilton Jordan ... He said he wanted to see where all the action was , where the famous basement caves were and if he could obtain some cocaine ... Shortly thereafter Steve Rubell appeared , whom I proceeded to introduce to Ham and his lady friends . A young man who is referred to as Johnny C and whom I know by sight and reputation as the man who always seems to put his fingers on such items as Ham had requested , suddenly appeared . <P> They Jordan , Rubell and Johnny C disappeared for a while . " Rubell had earlier said that during the disappearance Johnny C slipped Jordan some coke and Rubell watched him snort some . <P> Last week , however , the FBI found Johnny C.

The FBI interviewed four other people who had been with Jordan at Studio 54 ; none had observed any use of cocaine . <P> However the Studio 54 incident turns out , Administration supporters fear that new accusations of White House aides using drugs may come from other sources . <P> Since early in the Carter Administration , in fact , there has been talk in Washington of such practices . Indeed , the matter came up explicitly in July 1978 , when Dr. <P> Peter Bourne , health policy adviser to the White House , had to quit his post after he had improperly prescribed a drug for a friend . At the time , sources charged that Bourne himself had used cocaine . He told a New York Times reporter that there was " a high incidence " of marijuana and occasional cocaine use among members of the White House staff . <P> Jordan has denied all the Studio 54 charges , and the case is hardly the kind Congress had in mind when it drafted the Ethics in Government Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox . Congress set out to specify in detail the powers and tenure of a special prosecutor .
