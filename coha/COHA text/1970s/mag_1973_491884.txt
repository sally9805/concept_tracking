Evolution : Salvatore Bono . Cherilyn LaPiere . Sonny . Cher . Sonny and Cher . SonnyandCher . Out of the Great American Melting Pot into the Great American Bank Account . " When they see me-alone even-they say , Look ! There goes Sonny and Cher . " ( Cher ) " We ought to be interviewed separately ! " ( Sonny ) " We 're different people . " They are indeed . Yet so rare is a couple in show business-Burns and Allen , Roy and Dale ( or Trigger ) , Lunt and Fontanne-try picturing one without the other-that the individuals , in order to ride the wheels of success , must perform in tandem . Not so Sonny and Cher . Cher has just driven up in a sand-colored Rolls-Royce . She is wearing- ( a phrase that precedes her entire existence as a television superstar ) - blue jeans . Spangled and starred like Byzantium . A rosy raspberry sweater that comes-barely-to the bottom of her deservedly unknown-in an industry where statistics in this geographical area rival the national debt-chest . Boots-platformed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to Paris . We went there for dinner . " Sonny has emerged . Shaven . Hair dripping from his shower . In a green and apricot striped caftan . " She has about 8,000 pairs of shoes . " " 300 , " Cher says defensively . " What do you do with them ? " " I wear them . " " No you do n't . " The banter of the overspending wife , the under-earning husband . Despite the fact that for this week 's work they will get $100,000. $100,000 . Not peanuts . But turquoises . And gold . Baubles from Cartier . Matching crystal pen-dants with their birth signs . Cher is Taurus . Sonny-Aquarius . Antiques . ( " Our house is like a museum . " Cher . ) Cars . Three Mercedes . ( What is the plural of Mercedes ? ) A Ferrari . An Aston Martin . Jeep . Four motorcycles . A Cadillac convertible . ( For the chauffeur . ) What 's Cher 's favorite possession ? " I do n't have a favorite possession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorite . " She has been Shopping . An adored pastime . From long liquor hags- " The man brown-bagged everything , " she giggles to Sonny-surge silver and turquoise , beautiful Indian jewelry . Bracelets , rings , amulets . She makes none of the usual apologies . No " Well , they 'll do for Christmas gifts , " or " It was all on special sale . " No , it was full price . But before the bags are empty , she has poured most of it on Sonny ( an armband that looks like a two-inch can of tuna fish ) , her friends , her sister , and Chastity-a tiny silver bracelet with a turquoise that lies flat on the back of the child 's hand . Sonny settles down with an orange soda-about as far as he goes- " We 're so square we 're sickening " - Cher 's famous remark-and crosses his bare feet . By a musician 's feet , ye shall know him . Sonny 's are untortured . Which means he has n't pounded the pavements . Excessively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing what you want to do for a living , " he says , serious . The armband off . " She " - pointing to Cher- " never had to not do what she did n't want to do . " Cher looks at him from behind dark glasses as if she would dispute , thinks better of it , turns back to her bracelet , her extraordinary talons  --  each about an inch long . After all , if you 're a couple in show business , there are plenty of other people who 'll do your quarreling for you . Any movie magazine will tell you more about the Bonos ' personal life than they know themselves . And the magazines all seem to dwell on when the breakup is to be . A rock group  --  or a Hollywood marriage  --  is under constant pressure to break . Sonny ? " and " ? Cher are in both categories . Rumors fly . When they opened in Las Vegas  --  or was it Miami Beach ? ? Cher is reported to have stormed off the stage muttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do some work  --  outside of the group  --  on his own . But talking to them , one realizes that they are friends . That if they broke up as a marriage , they would still work together as an act . Or conversely , they might do separate things and still be a couple . The clich ? of them is that she is beautiful and he brainy . Like most cliches , part truth . But . She 's no idiot . And he 's handsome enough  --  dignified even , when he 's not being the stumble-bumble of their show . He 's talented . Multi . Films , songs  --  writer and arranger  --  business head , performer . " When you first ' arrive , ' " he says , " they tell you you need all these people . Business manager , makeup man , outfit designer , booking agent , tax lawyer . Then you find you can do a lot yourself . " Not everyone can . He can . Enter Chastity . With wastebasket on head . " Get out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better than an explanation . The child  --  four  --  accepts . She should be in school next year ? " She already is , " says Cher . Montessori ? " No . I looked at two of those . But I thought they might overpossess a child . " Cher is an intelligent mother  --  concerned but not a coddler who says that , in reality , Sonny is just as good a mother as she is . There is always that . The poking . But it is good-natured . And Sonny can give as well as take . No one could help liking him . CBS allows as how they are ideal stars . " They get to work on time , " says a network official . " They 're ready to work when they get there . She does n't have headaches . And he does n't want Mr. Paley 's job . " So what now ? Or next ? " A musical comedy , " Sonny says . " Maybe . I 've always thought timing is all . We were recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have to learn to do a lot of things as an entertainer . Somebody like Carol Burnett , Sinatra , Dean Martin . They 're total entertainers . " Later . That night . They entertain . At Harrah 's . Or any one of a hundred nightclubs somewhere between TV seasons . They work . Hard work . And if you 're close enough  --  and with a thousand people , crammed , " family style " into a hundred tables , it 's not likely  --  you can see , they sweat . Outside , an anxious young couple lined up to get in inquires ? " We 're number 151 . Do you think there 'll be 151 cancellations ? " Well , they can catch them on TV . In September . Even with thirty million viewers , it 's not crowded . And Sonny and Cher ? " One-night stands . Starting tomorrow ! " says Sonny . " Me ? I 'm basically lazy , " says Cher . " I like to lie in the sun and goof off . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonny ) " We like one-night stands . That way ( Cher ) we see a lot of movies . " " I 'm still scared . ( C ) He ( pointing ) he can talk to them ( audiences ) like they live next door . All the guys are his besi friends and he 's been to tea with all the ladies . " Not in the palms of their hands . No . In the space between them  --  that bittersweet battleground of love laid out by Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy  --  do they hold their audiences . As their underwearless bodies approach each other ( " Bob Mackie 's clothes are the kind you think you ca n't but you can " ) for the emotional climax of Continued on page 88 very long time . I guessed from the way she was looking at the piano that what she expected was an improved performance of the minuet . She had no idea that the work she was to hear would be my own . stood in front of her and produced the shiny instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solo penny whistle , by The Young Graham , " I announced , and put it to my lips . The notes rose shrill , piercing and beautiful . Miss Mansby sat up with a nervous little jerk . She hunched her shoulders and fluttered her eyelids almost as though in pain . " That 's enough now , dear , " she said . " That 's enough . " But it was n't enough  --  why , she had only heard half of it ! I went on playing . She would admire , I was sure , the middle bit where the tune went up high ; she must like my middle bit . " Please , " she said , and one thin hand went up toward the penny whistle . I skipped out of her reach and went on playing , wandering round the room as I did so . It was hard on the breathing , but gave my performance a casual air which I felt would impress her . I went through the middle section again , louder , faster and more squeakily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note towards him . Then I turned again , as I reached the concluding notes , towards the armchair . I looked at Miss Mansby . She was crying , the monstrous tears dribbling down her bony face . It was the first time I had ever seen an adult cry ; it seemed shocking , and not quite real . ( For if Miss Mansby could cry , why then , so could my mother , my father , so could Aunt Charlotte . Silently , behind closed doors , and I all unknowing , perhaps all grown-ups cried sometimes . ) What was the matter with Miss Mansby ? What had I done ? She was angry , she was unhappy , she was getting up to leave . " How could you , " she sobbed . her voice muffled in a huge handkerchief . " Why did you have to behave like this today , of all days ? Oh , how could you be so  --  so ... " and she picked up her coat and walked unsteadily towards the door , her hand lingering for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed it . I stood in the middle of the floor , my penny whistle still in my hand , sickened and confused . I had only tried to please her , had only done what Theyoungmozart had done , and she , a grown-up , had without a word of explanation begun to cry . When I heard the front door close I realized that she really had gone  --  had left the house in this extraordinary way without even writing down next week 's assignment in the little book . I ran to the window , and as I peered out on to the darkening street I had the feeling that she was never coming back . I watched her cross the street , and under the light of the lamppost I could see that she was still fingering her brooch as she faltered along . It was only then that I remembered I had n't asked how her mother was that day . n
