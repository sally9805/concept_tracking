THE travel industry is getting a boost from a new source : black economic power . Badgered by both legal and social barriers in the past , most blacks rarely wandered far from home . Those barriers are falling rapidly now-not only in the U.S. but in many countries round the world . As a result , airlines in the past several months have begun tying up with established black tour operators . Black newspapers , magazines and radio stations are being deluged with travel advertisements . A San Francisco tour operator , Bob Hayes , has written The Black American Travel Guide ( Straight Arrow Books ; $6.95 ) , and 4,000 copies have been sold since it was published nine months ago . Conservative estimates are that black tourists this year will spend $800 million , and by next year $1 billion , at airline ticket counters , on trains and buses and in hotels and restaurants . <P> Schoolteachers , college professors , doctors , lawyers and executives make up the bulk of the black tourist market . But a large number of black travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly-line workers . Many blacks now have better-paying jobs and often , as in millions of white families , both husband and wife work . The Census Bureau reported in 1970 that one-quarter of all U.S. black families earned more than $10,000 annually and that the black median income increased 50% during the 1960s , compared with only a 35% increase for whites . Banks and other loan agencies have made it easier for blacks to borrow money for vacations . " And I jokingly tell some of them that a trip is the only thing that ca n't be repossessed , " quips Freddye Henderson , operator of Atlanta-based Henderson Travel Service , one of the largest black travel agencies . <P> In almost every major city there is now a travel agency specializing in black tour packages . Most of them are run by experienced black travelers , such as Earl Jackson , a former New York City policeman who heads I.G.T.

They do n't turn away black travelers , but often they might give them a small room with no view . " The travel agents have found that blacks get good rooms at the hotels and motor inns operated by the major chains , such as the Hiltons and Holiday Inns . <P> Familiar U.S. vacation spots like Las Vegas and Disneyland are getting their share of the new tourists , but traveling abroad is becoming the more fashionable vacation . The InterAmerican Travel Agents Society estimates that 16% of all U.S. travelers going abroad this year will be blacks , up from 5% in 1965 . Canada and countries where blacks are established government leaders , such as Jamaica and Trinidad , are already favorite black vacation destinations . This year more U.S. blacks than ever will visit African countries . An increasing number of black travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong , Spain , France and Great Britain . South Africa and Rhodesia , split by racial turmoil at home , are about the only countries that still do not want these tourists .
