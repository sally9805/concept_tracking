Waving American flags and brandishing homemade placards reading GO HOME , FRENCHIE , a contingent of Copperweld Corp . employees marched past the French embassy in Washington recently , led by a man on stilts tricked out as Uncle Sam . That spectacle was only part of a wide-ranging fight being waged by workers and officials of Pittsburgh-based Copperweld , a specialty metal producer , to avoid being acquired by Imetal , a giant French mining concern controlled by the Rothschild family . Three weeks ago , Imetal made a tender offer to buy all of Copperweld 's stock for about $111 million . Since then the clash has developed into one of the fiercest corporate takeover battles in recent memory , marked by picketing , politicking and troubling antiforeign overtones . Last week Copperweld took its fight to a federal court in Pittsburgh to get a preliminary injunction to block the offer . <P> Octopus Defense . By week 's end , after hearing witnesses from both sides , senior Judge John L. Miller had not reached a decision . Whatever the outcome in Pittsburgh , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several more courts before it is resolved . At last week 's hearing , Copperweld officials , led by Chairman Phillip Smith , consistently sought to portray their company as a small American firm in danger of being gobbled up by a predatory foreign octopus . The Copperweld executives also insisted that Imetal 's proffered price is too low for a firm that has a book value of $160 million . The French company has offered to pay $42.50 each for Copperweld shares that sold at $34.50 just before the fight began and closed last week at $38.13 . <P> To counteract Copperweld 's arguments , Imetal unexpectedly flew in its urbane chairman , Baron Guy de Rothschild , to testify . In a clear British accent , Rothschild told the court that he will neither liquidate Copperweld , siphon off its profits or technology to other subsidiaries or shake up its management , " which is considered excellent . " Indeed , Rothschild asserted , Copperweld would prosper under Imetal . <P> Imetal is a holding company formed last November to manage about 70 subsidiaries engaged in mining ( nickel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processing , real estate , transportation and other ventures which the Rothschilds own or hold an interest in . Last year the group collectively posted after-tax income of $32.5 million on sales of $1.1 billion . The new firm 's interests reach from Europe to the South Pacific , Africa and South America . Copperweld would give it a sturdy beachhead in the U.S. , where the Rothschilds have no major operations now . Buying into American businesses has become attractive for more and more foreign firms because they can pick up bargains by paying in undervalued dollars still available in huge amounts around Europe . Moreover , foreigners correctly judge the U.S. to be recovering from world recession faster than other industrial nations .
