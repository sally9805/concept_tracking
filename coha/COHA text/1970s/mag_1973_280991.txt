" Hey , man , you did n't handle that one the way Columbo would have ! " <P> " Look , sergeant , if I was Inspector Erskine of The FBI , I would of had him for sure ! " <P> Such is the cop-shop banter on the Atlanta police force , says Sergeant W.E . Wood of the metropolitan narcotics squad . Like Wood , many real-life police officers , detectives and lawyers enjoy watching their fictionalized counter parts on television . " We watch Columbo and others , " says Atlanta Assistant District Attorney Ross Hawkins , " be cause it makes our jobs a little more palatable to watch someone who does always get his man . " <P> Most real-life lawmen , however , find that TV crime shows bear little relation to reality . " Take a recent episode of Streets of San Francisco , " says San Francisco Private Investigator Harold Lipset . " Karl Maiden and his partner drive right up to a suspect 's house and park in front . While they are inside , the suspect drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would n't do something like that . " Even more often , says TIME Correspondent Joseph Boyce , himself an ex-policeman , TV cops " go to every call with squad lights flashing and sirens screaming . " That , he says , would inevitably " cause you to lose them or put a hole through your forehead . You ca n't park and shoot at the same time . " <P> TV heroes crack their cases through brilliant deductions , whereas most actual crimes are solved through plodding legwork and tips from informers . Complains Manhattan Detective Lieut . Richard J. Gallagher : " You do n't ever get clues like they do on TV . " Gallagher points to a sign on his desk reading GOYA/KOD . " That stands for ' Get off your ass and knock on doors ! ' and that 's how homicides are really solved . " <P> The glamorous image does bring in a lot of eager recruits , though . Reports Boston Private Detective A. Michael Pascal : " They come in expecting to be issued a trench coat , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a pencil , a notebook and an assignment . " <P> Policemen and lawyers alike regret that TV viewers often expect real life to live up to its TV image . " The biggest problem criminal lawyers have , " says California Attorney Floyd Silliman , " is what we call the Perry Mason syndrome - jurors preconditioned by TV . According to TV , lawyers are not only supposed to get their clients acquitted , they are also supposed to ferret out the guilty parties . " <P> Atlanta 's Sgt. Wood cites a recent case in which a man was on trial for selling drugs to an undercover agent . " The jury wanted to know why we had n't gotten a picture of the buy and why we had n't gotten fingerprints from the packet , " he fumes . " But that 's not the way it works . You do n't go out and shout , ' I 'm an undercover agent buying dope ! ' Buys take place in dark alleys , and that little plastic bag they wanted us to get fingerprints from was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As a result of the jury 's TV-induced expectations , says Wood , the dope dealer was acquitted .
