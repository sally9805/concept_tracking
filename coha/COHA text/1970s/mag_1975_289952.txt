Can Jack Nicklaus keep up his recent winning pace to collect his fifth Masters title ? Can Johnny Miller , who missed the cut at the Heritage Classic , regain the winning touch that earned him three titles earlier this season ? How will Lee Elder handle the pressure of being the first black to compete for the winner 's green jacket ? These are among the tantalizing questions that will draw thousands of fans to Augusta , Ga. , this week , and millions more to their television sets to view golf 's most notable rite of spring-the Masters tournament . <P> Most will look for answers on the glamorous closing holes of the difficult 7,020-yd. , par-72 course . If so , they will not see how the Masters is likely to be won . The tournament 's toughest holes are far out on the course . That is the conclusion of Sam Snead , who has won the Masters three times ( 1949 , ' 52 , ' 54 ) , and of Bill Inglish , tournament statistician . After studying the 1,292 individual rounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past five years , Inglish found that Augusta 's six most difficult tests are not where they are supposed to be . For example , the long par fives , including holes 13 and 15 , play under par more frequently than any other holes . And Augusta 's two closing holes , both notoriously troublesome par fours , have not ruined as many scores as fans think . On the eve of the 39th Masters , Snead played and analyzed the six most challenging holes for TIME with Senior Correspondent ( and twelve-handicapper ) John Steele . Here is Snead 's personal vade mecum : <P> HOLE 4 : 220 yds. , par three ( average score : 3.27 ) . This hole often makes you think you 're playing in a wind tunnel because of tall trees behind and alongside of the green . The wind is usually against you , but it shifts quickly , and you 've got to watch it like a sparrow hawk . Once when I was paired with Hogan , Ben hit a full drive into a gale and he was short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green and almost landed out of play in the azaleas behind . The wind had died . It takes a 195-yd. hit , often with a one-iron , to carry the front bunker . The green is so big you 've got to hit directly to the pin or risk three putts . <P> HOLE 5 : 450 yds. , par four ( average score : 4.32 ) . This dogleg can be a horrible hole . It 's the kind where you like to make your par and go on about your business . On the drive , you 've got to skirt the left-hand traps if you 're going to get home in two shots . By hugging the left you can cut at least 25 yds. off your second shot , but it 's a dangerous business because of trees on the left , and if you have a hook , forget it . Even with a well-placed drive , you 've got to burn your second shot-usually a one-or two-iron for me . You have to drop the ball right on top of the plateau on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will break in two directions .
