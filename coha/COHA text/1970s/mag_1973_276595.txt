ELVIS ON TOUR <P> Directed by PIERRE ADIDGE and ROBERT ABEL <P> This is a movie of missed opportunities ; something very shrewd , pointed and telling could have been made about the man who began as a hard-driving rock star and became a sort of spangled mascot of Middle America . There is plentiful material here for social satire , the sort of thing the National Film Board of Canada did so nicely in their lacerating documentary on Paul Anka , Lonely Boy . Elvis might also have made a subject for a diverting visual essay on the sociology of pop . The filmmakers , who are responsible for the easygoing Joe Cocker documentary Mad Dogs and Englishmen ( 1971 ) , attempt none of this . Instead they settle for compiling an obsequious family album . <P> The credits bill Colonel Tom Parker as technical adviser , a title that does not do him justice . The colonel has been by Presley 's side since the beginning , a combination Machiavelli and mother hen without whose approval nothing goes out under the Presley imprimatur . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his influence is strongly felt . Thus , although it is supposed to be a documentary , most of the movie 's scenes seem as spontaneous as the Sadlers Wells Ballet . The concert footage is sweaty and lifeless , the music a combination of housebroken rock and soul-less gospel . <P> A couple of minor and diverting curiosities are included : the presence- fleeting , alas-of an agonizingly unfunny comedian named Jackie Kahane ; a fast , amusing montage of clinches from old Elvis pictures , featuring the star leering and nuzzling a variety of pneumatic starlets ; and a close look , offstage and on , at the Presley wardrobe , which for sheer flamboyance probably has not been matched since the days of Marie Antoinette .
