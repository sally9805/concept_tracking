Dial Ufor Usage <P> Should you write " in the 1960s " or " in the 1960 's " ? Is it " a U.S. Representative " or " an U.S. Representative " ? Where does the apostrophe go in " the Smiths ' ( or Smith 's ) car " ? *Fifteen times a day , on the average , telephone callers put these questions to an Emporia State University English instructor with the appropriate name of Faye Vowell . <P> Vowell , who presides with consonance over the university 's writing lab in Emporia , Kans. , offers free guidance on a writer 's hot line , a Dial-a-Grammarian service for students and anyone else who calls with a question about correct usage . Other such lines have sprung up lately at the University of Arkansas in Little Rock , Ark. , and the Johnson County Community College near Kansas City , Kans . " We get several calls a week from California alone , " says Arkansas English Instructor Michael Montgomery . The most common questions concern the correct use of who vs. whom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretaries struggling with their bosses ' dictation . But college faculty members and local magazine editors have also rung up the help fully un-silent Vowell and her colleagues . <P> The hot lines are less than two years old , and growing steadily in popularity . The phone service costs Arkansas and Johnson County next to nothing , since instructors and graduate students from writing labs are regularly assigned to phone duty , and the callers pay for their own calls . But at Emporia the service is costing the English department roughly an extra $100 per month , because the university pays for calls made to its toll free number from anywhere in the state of Kansas . <P> Since it is easier to phone somebody than to look something up , the hot line may prove more of a debilitating crutch than a boon to education . But so far , the hot-line faculties report , Kansas students have not thrown their Fowlers to the winds . The service has led to more , rather than less , concern about learning usage . <P> TIME Reporter Tim Miller tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges . Emporia State and Arkansas , but not Johnson County , corrected his run-on sentence ( " Enrollments will continue to decline , no change in the pattern is in sight " ) and his incorrect use of " less " for " fewer " ( " Less students are enrolled this year than last " ) . The response was no better when he wanted to check out the more subtle misuse of " whom " in a subordinate clause ( " They wanted to hire whomever was the best candidate " ) . A Johnson County instructor correctly insisted that Miller switch to " whoever , " but at Emporia , an unidentified voice , presumably a graduate student , told Miller the sentence was correct as it stood . The quickest and surest correct answers to all three questions were provided by Little Rock 's Montgomery , who mans his hot line during morning hours . His number : 501-569-3162. - <P> * The answers : 1 ) Either 1960s or 1960 's is correct ; 2 ) " a U.S. Representative " ; 3 ) " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
