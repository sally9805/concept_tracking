Perhaps the most striking characteristic of America 's 184,000 coal miners is their intense loyalty to one another and their union . Some people explain that loyalty as an aboveground extension of the close teamwork that the miners must practice in dangerous subterranean mines ; others say it is a result of facing common enemies-the coal companies and the Federal Government . Whatever the reason , when one union local walks off the job , others usually follow in sympathy . <P> Last week that was certainly the case . A wildcat strike that started at a Cedar Coal Co. mine at Cabin Creek , W. Va. , suddenly spread to include all of the state 's 60,000 miners , plus 10,000 of their fellows in Ohio , Pennsylvania , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Virginia and Colorado . The miners had lost a total of $24 million in wages by week 's end , and U.S. coal output had fallen by 6 million tons , worth $150 million . <P> A relatively trivial matter triggered the massive walkout . This spring Local 1759 of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their contract advertised so it could be filled by a union applicant . After management disagreed , an arbitrator was brought in and eventually ruled against the union . The angry miners first tried to reverse that ruling in federal court . When the court delayed , they protested with their only remaining weapon-an illegal wildcat . <P> Heavy Hand . Cedar Coal , a unit of American Electric Power Co. , then got a federal court to issue an injunction against the strike . When the miners ignored it , the judge fined the local $50,000 , which went unpaid . At that point , miners elsewhere started to take notice . To them , the case was just another in a series in which the heavy hand of the Federal Government patted the companies and slapped the union . " When that judge gets out of the coal business , that 's when we go back to work , " vowed a Cabin Creek miner , and his fellows in other areas obviously agreed . <P> At least one coal company looked to the courts to reopen its mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association . " Everyone is the victim , but shameful wildcats go on . " In fact , only the coal companies and such coal-carrying railroads as the Chessie System and Norfolk and Western have so far been hurt . The fuel 's major users-electric utilities , coke plants and steel mills-maintain 23-to 90-day stockpiles , enough to ride out a short strike . <P> A much more certain victim , paradoxically , is the U.M.W. itself . Every day that the wildcat walkout continues costs the union 's four main health and retirement funds nearly $1 million because they get their money from royalties on coal production . One trust , which provides health benefits to the 200,000 miners who retired before 1974 , is being especially hard hit . It was operating at a deficit before the strike , and now has to go deeper into debt .
