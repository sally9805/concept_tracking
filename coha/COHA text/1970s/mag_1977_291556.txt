The U.S. is being invaded so silently and surreptitiously that most Americans are not even aware of it . The invaders come by land , sea and air . They fly commercial and private aircraft ; they jump ship or sail their own boats ; they scale mountains and swim rivers . Some have crawled through a mile-long tunnel ; others have squeezed through the San Antonio sewerage system . No commandos or assault troops have shown more ingenuity and determination in storming a country that tries to keep them out . They are the illegal immigrants who come not to destroy but to enjoy the blessings of the most prosperous nation on earth . <P> Vast Scale . What was once a trickle has become a flood . Exact figures are hard to come by , but U.S. officials estimate that between 6 million and 10 million illegal aliens are living in the U.S. Last year alone , between 500,000 and 1 million arrived-while another 750,000 were caught and deported . If these numbers are added to the 400,000 legal newcomers who enter every year , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast scale of that of the turn of the century. * Last week , while concentrating on energy , the Carter Administration was studying the implications of the invasion and trying to solve the problems it raises . <P> The growing population and unemployment of the Third World countries are propelling people to a better life in the U.S. Some 80% of the illegal aliens now living in America came from Mexico , where the population is growing at the rate of 3.5% a year , the jobless rate approaches 40% , and a man lucky enough to find work may be paid $1 a day . Small wonder that close to 10% of all Mexicans actually reside in the U.S. , and Los Angeles has the third largest concentration of Mexicans ( after Mexico City and Guadalajara ) . <P> In the past few years increasing numbers of Haitians , Colombians , Jamaicans , Greeks , Filipinos and Nigerians have joined the migration . The aliens used to do mainly farm work in the South and Southwest . But they have now established enclaves in major urban centers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 50,000 illegal aliens in Washington , D.C. , more than 500,000 in Chicago and 1.3 million in the New York metropolitan area . Says Leonard Chapman , who stepped down last month as commissioner of the INS : " We have become the haven for the unemployed of the world . I think it 's going to be catastrophic . " <P> This incessant invasion presents the U.S. with a basic dilemma . A nation of immigrants is reluctant to reject other immigrants , particularly those who want to get ahead in the best American tradition . Few come for a handout ; they are anxious to make a living . An illegal alien who is currently employed as an industrial painter in Brooklyn used to live on a South Pacific island where he dreamed of the American paradise of hard work . " It is the obsession of every islander , " he says , " to come and be rewarded for what he does " -a dream shared round the world .                 @ @ @ @
