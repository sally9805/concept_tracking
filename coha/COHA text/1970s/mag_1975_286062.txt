The U.S. economy at last seems unmistakably to be recovering from recession ; many economists now think that an expected tapering off in business inventory cutting alone almost guarantees growth in U.S. output at an annual rate of about 7% for the rest of 1975 . Nonetheless , the long road back to full prosperity contains many potential pitfalls , which were all too evident last week . President Ford finally produced a plan for gradual decontrol of oil prices that has a chance of passing Congress , but some threat remains of an abrupt jolt to the economy when present controls expire Aug. 31 . A June spurt in consumer prices indicated that inflation is not yet dead , and a renewed rise in interest rates stirred fear among some economists that the Federal Reserve Board is not pursuing policies expansive enough to promote an accelerating recovery . Details : <P> Oil : Down to the Wire <P> It was hard to believe that reasonable men could have so much trouble avoiding a crisis whose arrival had been pinpointed so precisely so far in advance . Ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , President Ford and the Democratic leaders of Congress have known that at most they had only until Aug. 31 to reach agreement : if no new legislation is signed by then , price controls on domestically produced oil will expire and petroleum prices will shoot up faster than either side wants . Actually , the effective deadline was Aug. 1 , since Congress regularly adjourns then for one month or more . Yet it was not until the end of last week , with a scant five days left for legislative action , that the outlines of a bill with a real chance of becoming law finally emerged . <P> Less than 24 hours before he emplaned for the European Security Conference in Helsinki , President Ford sent Congress a plan that he hopes will end the impasse . It seeks to reconcile Ford 's insistence that oil prices must be allowed to rise substantially-in order to stimulate U.S. production and diminish the nation 's dependence on OPEC imports - with the Democrats ' fears that the rises would be inflationary and impede economic recovery . At present , " old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced in 1972-is price-controlled at $5.25 per bbl. ; " new " oil is uncontrolled and sells at about $13 . The President 's new bill would gradually lift the controls on old oil over a 39-month period . Each month more oil would be decontrolled , but the schedule is so set up that the biggest impact on prices would not occur until after the November 1976 elections . The immediate effect on an economy recovering from inflationary recession would be minimal ; by White House estimate , prices of gasoline and other petroleum products would rise a mere half-cent to a penny per gallon this year . <P> Windfall Profits . Also , the bill would establish an initial ceiling of $11.50 per bbl. for all oil ; that would force an immediate rollback of about $1.50 per bbl. in the present price of uncontrolled crude . Then the ceiling price would be increased five cents each month through November 1978 . The plan also calls for taxing oil companies ' " windfall " profits and returning part of the money to the consumer , perhaps in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
