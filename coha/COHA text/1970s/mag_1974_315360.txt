If there is one thing an electric utility is supposed never to do , it is omit a quarterly dividend ; investors buy utility stocks primarily to get those dividends . Last week the unthinkable happened : New York 's Consolidated Edison Co. , the biggest U.S. power generator , skipped its dividend for the first time in its 89-year history . The news gave Wall Street a high-voltage shock . Con Ed stock promptly lost a third of its value , dropping from 18 to 12 ( it closed the week at 12 ? ) , and the dive dragged down prices of many other utility stocks . <P> Although Con Ed 's first-quarter profits dropped 21% , they were still large enough ( 48 a share ) to maintain the dividend ( 45 ) . But the utility 's managers decided they must hang onto every penny for uses even more important than rewarding stockholders . Most crucial : paying for the low-sulfur Arab oil that the utility must buy in order to avoid polluting the skies over New York City and Westchester County . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Con Ed is paying as much as $15.50 . A near doubling of its electric and gas rates since 1970 has not given it enough money to meet the bill . <P> Rating Lowered . By passing the dividend , though , Con Ed has created more problems for itself . Like most utilities , it must frequently sell new issues of stock or bonds to finance maintenance and expansion of its system . When the dividend was omitted , Standard &; Poor 's immediately lowered the credit rating on Con Ed bonds-so much that some potential investors , such as savings and loan associations , will be legally barred from buying them . As a result , Con Ed in effect is asking New York State to do some of its borrowing for it . Under a plan that the legislature in Albany is likely to pass this week , the state will sell an $800 million bond issue . It will use $500 million to buy from Con Ed two uncompleted generating plants-a nuclear-powered plant at Buchanan , N.Y. , and an oil-fired facility in Queens-and the other $300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Con Ed to operate . <P> Whether that will solve Con Ed 's crisis is uncertain . It is trapped in a vicious cycle common to utilities : as its rates rise , customers burn less electricity and revenues fall , forcing more rate increases that cut usage further . But it has many problems of its own . The state public service commission requires that its rates be based on last year 's costs . A 60-day lag exists between Con Ed 's paying for fuel and receiving payment for it from customers ; currently the utility has spent $107 million to generate electricity for which no bills have yet been sent out . Some Con Ed customers are so angered by rate hikes that they are paying bills slowly or not at all .
