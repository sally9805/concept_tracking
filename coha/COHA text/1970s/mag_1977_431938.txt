 | The first thing you notice is how breathtakingly beautiful she is ? far more beautiful than the woman you see on TV . Hers are the most expressive pair of eyes this side of Elizabeth Taylor . Enormous . Deep green . Translucent . Her long , curved lashes , arched to her forehead , run up and down like velveteen window shades when the lady who owns them is shifting emotional ground . And that she does frequently , just as she goes in for a kind of nonstop , free-association style of speech which leaves her hearers gasping for breath . She herself never has to gasp for anything . On the contrary , she 's blessed with more than enough energy to cope with anything her jampacked double life might throw her way . The woman in question is , of course , Suzanne Pleshette , other-wise  | known as Emily Hartley , wife of the TV psychologist played by Bob Newhart , and as Mrs. Thomas Joseph Gallagher III , the husband she goes home to after the day 's work is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concise , strong-minded , logical , a little impatient . Hartley , her nine-to-five husband , is reserved , careful , deliberate , gentle , given to long , thoughtful silences . Suzanne ( or sometimes Suzy ) has no trouble getting along with either husband . For behind those unbelievable eyes and that seemingly hit-ormiss , rapid-fire style of speech is a shrewd and thoughtful human being who understands her own compulsions and has made more than tenuous peace with them . The episode of The Bob Newhart Show filming the week we talked , for example , had very little of Suzy as Emily Hartley . She did n't mind being downplayed . But she did mind the feeling that she was n't really earning her money and told a bemused Bob Newhart , " I feel like I 'm stealing . " Typically , Suzanne ? the perpetual gadfly ? did n't drop it there . Instead of accepting a modest workload as a temporary act of God and the script writers , she surveyed the set , decided that a newly constructed Hartley kitchen was n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redesigning it . She told me with great satisfaction , " Some scenes give me nothing to do except go to the kitchen and get lost , ' which means I have to be doing something , since the audience s watching me . The only way I have to get lost is in the refrigerator . The new set put it in the wrong place for that . Besides , there was this big island in the middle built so high we could n't get close together to play scenes in the kitchen . So I did it over . And " ? triumphantly ? " that 's how I earned my money this week . " Suzanne admits without embarrassment that she is totally hooked on the Puritan work ethic . Not only that , she adds simply , " I long ago faced the fact that my values were hopelessly middle class . But they work for me . " They also seem to work with both of her men . " I think the Hartleys have the best marriage on television , " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did n't marry when they were chitdren ; they chose to marry , as adults , neither one seeking identity or validation . So you have two people together because they want to be , balancing one another and appre- ciating their parther 's virtues and finding weaknesses endearing . Last year , the Hartleys had a run of very funny , sophisticated bedroom fight scenes that worked wonderfully well . But both Bob and Suzanne began to get uncomfortable with the tone and finally asked the writers to cool it . " We realized that what we were really saying about this marriage ? to get some easy laughs ? was that these were two people sniping at each other . And that was n't true to either the people or the marriage . " The characterization Suzanne puts into her part won her a nomination for a " best performance " Emmy award . In the high-rise apartment to which Suzanne retreats at the end of each working day to meet Thomas Joseph Gallagher III ? a tall , broadshouldered businessman with dark hair and lush moustache , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the values are much the same . " Tom and I are a team , " says Suzanne . " Each of us has our strengths and weaknesses , as do Bob and Emily Hartley and every other married couple I know . When one of us is incomplete , the partner has the missing piece , so we function well as a unit . " We wanted to be married , to make a life together ? and we work at it . We 've made an enormous commitment to each other . Neither of us felt diminished or felt a loss of freedom by getting married . We had both been married before and found what did n't work . Tommy and I disagree philosophically about many things , but on the fundamentals of two people building a relationship together , we agree completely . " This was a natural evolution for Suzanne Pleshette because all her life she has made what she calls " life choices . " Some of them came very early . Suzy was the only child of a ballerina ? who married at 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn 's largest theaters during the era of the big-band stage shows . Since her father worked nights , family dinners were usually in midtown restaurants , and Suzy grew up on a first-name basis with entertainment luminaries of that day . She went to public school and dated older boys , which her female classmates resented . " I was always treated like an adult by my parents , and I never had another kid to play with at home . All I wanted was to be like other kids , but I just was n't . " She chose New York 's High School of the Performing Arts ? at 12 ? mainly because she did n't like any of the other public high schools , " and from that day on , 1 was the happiest little human you ever saw . " She spent one year at Syracuse University where a brilliant teacher turned her briefly from acting to sociology . She transferred to New York 's Finch College as a sociology major , but when she was offered a summer acting job , Suzanne took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Playhouse and Sandy Meizner 's Acting School to bigger and better jobs in the theater and live television . Then Jerry Lewis hired her for a movie , and Suzanne Pleshette ? barely out of her teens ? became one of the busiest actresses in the business . But she was also beginning to make " life " decisions . As a young single girl on Broadway , she was doing well as an actress , " but when everybody else was going out on dates , I was going to work . I missed out on a lot of life . " So she switched to television and films to be able to " finish work at a reasonable hour and at least be available for a dinner date . There 's no job , " she says , " that I ca n't walk away from if it means  | I 'm going to get cheated out of my life . It 's as simple as that . " By her late 20s Suzy had been through a brief marriage to actor Troy Donahue , for whom she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had a lot of pretty rigid rules then but he loosened me up , taught me to laugh . We loved each other very much , but we had little else in common . When we both realized that over the long haul we would be strangers , we chose to be apart . I have not one ounce of bitterness . " Suzanne met Tom Gallagher at a party in 1965 . At least she thought she did until recently when an old friend of Tom 's told Suzy that Tom had first seen her a year earlier in a restaurant , pointed her out and said , " She 's going to be my wife some day . " It took three years , and Suzy whistles at the realization they have now been married for a decade . Gallagher was then , and still is , a wealthy Texan who handles the investments of his family and pursues a multitude of . other business interests that intrigue him , including managing the affairs of a boat company ( he 's an aquatic buff ) and keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were some early crises in their marriage . Says Suzy , " Having never been a full-time housewife , I thought this was what was expected of me . But it did n't take me long to find out I was imposing it on myself . I guess I needed to play it out , and Tom let me . Then he said Okay , fine , you 've proved your point . Now , if you do n't want to act go back to school or look into volunteer work . Just get involved , because you 've always been an active interesting woman and , frankly , you 're getting boring . ' And he was right . " Meanwhile , Tom was learning communication ? Suzanne style . " He 'd never fight with anyone . He 'd just walk out . So he had to learn to communicate . I 'd tell him that if he cared about me , he 'd have to listen to what was wrong and then we 'd have to do something about it together . It took a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now we can . " So Suzanne went back to work as an actress and Tom began to communicate ? and their marriage prospered . " Tommy does n't make commitments easily , " says Suzanne , " and when he does , they 're real and they 're good . I find him more at-  | tractive now than when we married . Maybe because his sl of humor keeps growing . No tionship could survive this long me without humor . And his is derful . " Suzy made quite a name for self on the talk-show circuit her husband told her to go ba work , and she happened to a. with Bob Newhart on the Je Carson Show the same nigh : producers of Newhart 's upc series were looking for a le lady . The chemistry was spl. and the producers ' problem solved . They did n't think that ? an immensely respected and priced actress ? would settle fo and banana on a TV series , but did n't know what was going her life at the time . First she wanted work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work hard at her marriage second , she was pregnant .

It seemed : : liar request to the producer , had no idea she was pregnathey agreed because they Suzy . She lost the baby in h : - month , but she still had ever .. tion of exercising the pre clause . But nothing has hap Suzy is philosophical at " After years of trying to a child , Tommy and I have we 've reached a different p our lives . We do n't need c to feel whole , and I 'm getti enough so that it would be for me to handle a baby . I 've wanted children badly ? and tally I 'd wanted Tommy 's But time passes .

" Since the Gallaghers and harts knew one anothe sonably well before a workin tionship developed , the fie energy that surround Suzan a limited impact on the r Newhart . The tone Newhart sets f show is one of quiet efficiene though the company is grey , Newhart seldom participates .

Wh the issue was in doubt , the comp was desolate . Says Suzanne , " Wh we had to face the possibility breaking up our working famil. was very painful . It 's like so body you love dies .

" Traditional values are terra important to Bob : his wife and dren , his church , the principle , which he lives . But there are many qualities beyond that ? , interests , humor , sharp intelligeloyalties , the same qualities that tracted me to Tommy . Bob 's a N cious reader ? everything i aerodynamics to parapsychology and he absorbs concepts and . discuss them . " Newhart 's perceptions , hove are n't always on target .

Newhart reacted much the s. way but , says Suzanne , " He assn : that I would approve it bet .. Tommy and I were modern pet with modern views on such relat  | ships . Well , I do think that for some mature couples ? not children of any age ? living together before marriage may be valuable . But it was inappropriate for the people in that script .

Tommy and I have the same values in our marriage as Bob and Ginny Newhart and Bob and Emily Hartley , and we work at preserving them . I think that surprised Bob . " The Gallaghers have evolved a life-style that squares with their work program but is a long way from Suzy 's early housewifely standards . They both get home from work about six o'clock and take care of accumulated phone calls . ( Home is a highrise apartment they moved into a year ago when Suzanne felt overwhelmed with guilt that they were n't really using their two-acre estate in Beverly Hills , complete with tennis court , pool and guest house . ) They go out to a jeans-and-tennis-shoe dinner , usually with another couple " so Tommy is n't cheated out of some continuity of social life just because I 'm working . " They are usually home by 8:30 , in robes , reading and talking about the day 's activities .

( " In the restaurant , we can talk to each other , and we can eat what we want . It works for us right now . " ) They had two dogs in their large house ; one died before their move , the other was put in a foster home . Says Suzy , " Our lease expires in January , and we have to decide pretty soon if we 've outgrown the apartment . If we buy another house , we 'll have dogs again . I saw that movie about Benji , and when I heard they were making another one , I called the Benji people and told them I know how these location romances go , and if Benji had puppies , I 'd like one of the pups . Then we 'd have to move into a house . " But whether it 's choosing a house or a part , she has her priorities . " I do n't sit back and wait for the great parts . I love being an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm 72 , standing around the back lot doing Gunsmokes . Right now , all sorts of possibilities are being offered me , and I do n't know which direction I 'll go . " What she does know is that she 'll make a " life choice " that wo n't disrupt relationships on which she puts a higher priority than work . Happily , those possibilities are expanding . She 's turned down a number of plays , for example , because Tom did n't want to live in New York . But now he is less reluctant . " There are people who will be totally self-involved all their lives because that 's their makeup . There are others who thrive on the beginnings of relationships , the passion ; every time a relationship levels off , these people change partners , still looking for that magic . If anybody had tried to convince me when I was 18 that the intense pleasure of day-to-day existence with a marriage partner could be more exciting than the passion at the beginning , I would n't have believed them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
