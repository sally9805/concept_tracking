The house lights fade out , music fades in from afar ; in space , and in time . Music : a spirited Yiddish folk song : " Morgen , Morgen " ( Tomorrow , Tomorrow ) . Lights come up on the front curtain . An impression of the outskirts of Vilna , Poland . The date  --  1931  --  is fixed in the design . The curtain is lit for night . The music becomes a French military march played on a portable phonograph . The curtain rises on a Jewish meeting hall , sometimes used as a theatre . Chairs and tables , arranged haphazardly . A pile of benches . A dismantled platform in sections . A large porcelain stove . A rehearsal is in progress . Morris , the author-director , sits beside the phonograph , watching the music . He is an intense young man , wearing eye-glasses . At one side , Zina sits , studying the script . She is middle-aged , lively and attractive . Arnold , in a rocker , conducts the music , semi-professionally . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stage Center : Michael ( playing Captain Dreyfus ) and Mendl ( playing the Adjutant of the Republican Guard ) . Michael is the youngest member ; Mendl , a tailor , is in his forties , and serious . Both stand at attention , stiffly . The march ends . Morris shifts his attention to the players and gives them a hand cue . Mendl salutes , Michael salutes . Mendl executes an exaggerated left-face . Michael repeats the action with a right-face . They face each other . Mendl begins to mime the degradation ceremony . With larger-than-life gestures , he pretends to tear off one of Michael 's epaulets , then another . Now the buttons , one by one ; the braid ; the trouser stripes . Michael stands expressionlesss . Mendl holds out both hands . Michael pantomimes pulling his sabre from its scabbard . Mendl takes it , breaks it dramatically across his knee , thrws down the two pieces , and resumes his position of military attention . A pause . Too long . MORRIS Nu ? What 're you waiting ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  MORRIS No , no ! No discussion . MICHAEL ( Acting Dreyfus . ) " On the head of my wife , on the heads of my children , I swear that I am innocent . I swear it ! " ( As himself . ) So . Now can I talk ? ( Silence . Mendl is troubled , as are the other players . Morris walks around Michael and Mendl , worried . Finally Mendl breaks . He takes a step toward Morris . ) MENDL You 'll see . When we 'll have the real costumes and the real sabre and the buttons  --  ( Morris stops in front of Michael . ) MORRIS You know what it is ? No good . ( Michael nods , then shrugs . ) MICHAEL I do n't feel anything . I do n't know how . You think maybe if  --  ? ( Morris silences him with a gesture , and continues pacing . Arnold whispers to Zina . She shushes him . Mendl 's foot has gone to sleep . He tries to wake it . Michael stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polodnik . You are Alfred Dreyfus  --  in the courtyard of the barracks . ( He points . ) There  --  fellow officers and soldiers . And the crowd  --  screaming insults . Zina  --  ( He snaps his fingers. ) p. 4 ZINA " Death to the Jews ! Death to the Jews ! " MORRIS And you must convince them , all of them  --  that you 're innocent . And you are . So . Just cry out your innocence  --  Dreyfus 's innocence . Later  --  after he 's torn off the braid and the buttons and broken your sabre , then you 're in a daze and you say to yourself : " But I 'm innocent ! " Like that . Simply . Quietly . " But I 'm innocent ! " All right ? ( Michael nods . ) Now , they 've just read the sentence . MICHAEL " Soldiers ! They 're degrading an innocent person ! Soldiers ! They 're dishonoring an innocent man ! Long live France ! Long live the Army ! " MORRIS The adjutant approaches you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at him , he looks at you .

Build it up to the sabre . ( Mendl follows . ) There are nine . Slowly . Each one like tearing off a piece of skin . ( Mendl is offended by this idea and shows it . ) React , Michael . ( Michael reacts . Morris continues to direct . ) Now the sabre . ( Mendl holds out his hands . ) Formal , no feeling . Now you , Michael . Dreyfus . Dignified , contemptuous . ( Michael overacts . ) Not too much . A little contemptuous is enough . ( Michael holds out his imaginary sabre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Now , Dreyfus . Michael , you . " But I 'm innocent ! " ( Michael concentrates . A silence. ) p. 5 MICHAEL Why did he shout , " Long live the Army ! " ? MORRIS What ? MICHAEL Why did he shout , " Long live the Army ! " ? MORRIS Why do n't you say first your line and after ask questions ? God ! ( He walks away . ) MENDL You 'll see . When we 'll have the real costumes  --  I 'm going to make him such a costume  --  and the braid and the buttons  --  ARNOLD ( Rising . ) It could be , you know , that Michael  --  he 's a fine boy  --  but  --  what I 'm saying is  --  it could be that this role  --  this Dreyfus  --  could be too much for him . A question of lack of experience  --  MORRIS ( Sitting down on the bench . ) Aw-haw ! Goodbye rehearsal ! ARNOLD I 'm only saying  --  hear me out  --  if Michael ca n't do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , a big role . An important character . And important characters are always hard . That is to say  --  not easy . ( Morris sighs . ) After all . A Captain is a Captain  --  even a Jewish Captain . And a beginner is a beginner  --  even a Jewish beginner . p. 6 MORRIS So who could play it ? ARNOLD ( After a shrug . ) A more experienced actor , maybe ? A little more colorful , with what in the theatre we call " authority " ? ( He is suiting the action to the word . ) And a certain natural elegance . After all , a Captain . ( As he pronounces the word , he becomes one . ) MORRIS You , maybe ? ARNOLD Me ? Well , now that you suggest it , why not ? MORRIS Why not ! You can play anything . ARNOLD Anything , no . But many things , yes . I know I never boast  --  you all know that  --  ( The general reaction is revealing . ) But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VENGEANCE  --  he took me aside  --  a gentleman  --  he did n't want to offend the others  --  and he said to me : " Arnold , you are the best ! " His words exactly . MENDL Hah ! ARNOLD Hah ? MENDL I was there . You do n't remember ? And it was not aside , it was in front of everybody . And his words exactly ? I 'll give you his words exactly . He said : " Arnold , you are one of the best in the suburb of North Vilna. " p. 7 ARNOLD Oh , no ! Not " one of the "  --  " the "  --  and not North and not suburb , and you were n't there . This he said to me in Lublin . When I played in Lublin . MENDL Yeh yeh . In Lublin he said you 're one of the best in North Vilna . ( His sally produces a laugh . ) ARNOLD Mendl , do n't go too far . I am an artist . I make my living as a barber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joke about anything , but  --  MORRIS May I have your permission , Mr. Artist , to continue this rehearsal ? ARNOLD Excuse me , Morris . ( They shake hands . ) Ladies and gentlemen of the company , I beg your pardon . ( He offers his hand to Mendl , who takes it with a good-natured shrug and a smile . ) I get carried away sometimes . All artists do . ( He bows to Zina . She bows back . He moves to Michael . ) Come here my boy  --  it 's so easy to play a Captain . What is that I hear you talking ? " I feel the character , I do n't feel him . " I 'll tell you a professional secret . I personally have never felt anything  --  but has that stopped me from playing every kind of character in every kind of play ? No . You do n't " feel " a character , you " feel " a girl 's behind . Look , what does a Captain do ? ( He brandishes an imaginary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it . ) " Forward march ! On my order charge ! At the ready bayonets ! Ready  --  aim  --  fire ! Death to the enemy ! " ( As himself . ) That 's all there is to it . ( A final leftover thrust . ) " Sabres ! Advance ! Victory ! " ( He all but takes a bow and puts his sabre back into its scabbard . ) You see ? p. 8 MICHAEL Yes , but here in this scene he ca n't do that . They 're degrading him . So how can he  --  ? ARNOLD It 's the same , the same . ( Improvising . ) " Soldiers , hear me . They 're degrading an innocent person . They 're dishonoring a blameless man . Present arms ! " ( As himself . ) And then , if we have trumpets  --  ( Mendl creates a fanfare. )  --  everybody in the hall will cry . I guarantee it . Cry ! Well , you keep trying . I 'll help you if I can . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets to be too much for you , listen , if that happens , and Morris agrees , we can change parts . That 's to say , you play Zola  --  a better part , but easier  --  and I 'll take over this Dreyfus . MORRIS Finished ? ARNOLD I was only  --  MORRIS I 'm the director . I do the casting . And Captain Dreyfus , by the way , was n't like your idea of a Captain . He was a sensitive man  --  modest , humble . ARNOLD ( He falls to his knees . ) " Innocent ! I 'm innocent , General . Have pity . " ( He weeps . ) MORRIS Why do n't you go home ? I wo n't get to you tonight , anyway . p. 9 ARNOLD No , no . I like to watch . Actually , you sometimes learn from watching other actors ' mistakes . MORRIS Places ! We 'll begin again from  --  ARNOLD As long as we stopped  --  there 's one little observation I 'd like to make . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . It 's only  --  now , I 've read the whole play  --  not just my part the way most actors do . I like it , I do n't deny I 'd rather be playing Dreyfus  --  but well , all right . You landed me with this Emile Zola-Shmola . All right . I do n't complain . I 'm a good soldier  --  in fact , I would be a good Captain  --  ha , ha , ha  --  but , well , all right . Morris . Be fair . Be professional . Dreyfus  --  we see him with his wife . Yes ? We see him when he 's emotional . No ? And the moments of love . Good . The public likes that  --  but . What about Emile ? Mr. Zola ? He has n't got a wife and children ? No friends , no family ? So what kind of man is he ? Why is n't there a scene  --  say one little scene where they could see him in his own home , not making speeches for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  two handed pinochle with a friend . No ? Maybe alone  --  playing my violin . The public likes that . ( Suddenly . ) Oi ! In the whole piece  --  not one song , not one dance . Oi , oi , oi . Who 's going to come to see a play without even one little bit of some kind of music ? Who ? p. 10 MORRIS But we have  --  ARNOLD I know  --  you 're going to tell me about your bugles , about your marches . But here  --  the public does n't like military music . It reminds them of the Army . MORRIS Can somebody make him stop ? ARNOLD Why could n't Zola sing something instead of that little thing about " I accuse ! " And , by the way , would n't that be better in French ? I can say it in French . " J'accuse ! " It 's , after all , a famous little thing . MORRIS It 's not a little thing ! It 's an open letter to Monsieur Felix Faure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest letters of all time . ARNOLD Who said not ? But maybe too great for this town . Too long . He was a writer , your Mr. Zola-Shmola . And the trouble with writers , they know too many words . Believe me , a little song  --  this is theatre , not history . And what 's theatre ? Theatre is pleasing the public . ( He improvises  --  or borrows  --  a mournful tune and sings . ) " Yaw , baw , baw , baw , boi.Baw , baw , baw , baw , boi.Yaw , baw , baw , oi , oi.J'accuse ! J'accuse ! J'accuse ! " ZINA So long as everybody 's having their say  --  let me ask you . Why is it I have no part in this play ? p. 11 MORRIS You have , Zina , you have . ZINA That 's a part ? I come on twice screaming , " Death to the Jews ! " Some part . That 'll make me popular in the neighborhood . I can see myself in the market the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By me , that 's not a part . The crowd . Why could n't they see Dreyfus 's mother ? " A soldier . My son  --  a soldier . " ( Her eyes to heaven . ) " What have I done , dear God ? " ( To her imaginary son . ) " They 'll beat you . They wo n't ever accept you . Why ? Because you 're a Jew . Why do n't you be a tailor like your father ? Learn the trade , work a while with him and after , you can work for yourself . What 's better ? Your own business , your own boss . The way things are that 's always best for a Jew . Not the Army . In the Army no matter how high you go , there 's always somebody higher who 's an anti-Semite . Oi , vay ! My Dreyfusele ! Do n't become a goy . Stay with us . All right , so we 're not so rich , so we 're not so happy , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . And if some day things go wrong , God should forbid , a pogrom  --  so we 'll run away to another country . Elsewhere . Anywhere . People always need a tailor . But a Captain ? What country wants a Captain ? Or if they do want a Captain , do they want a Jewish Captain ? No . They do n't want you , but they wo n't let you go  --  they treat you like a dirty Jew and tear off your buttons , and break your sword in half , and you have to stand there and salute , and say , ' Yes , General , thank you General . Long live France ! Long live the Army ! Long live the Pope ! Long live the anti-Semites , the Inquisition , the pharaohs ! ' Listen to your mother , mein gold . Do n't go be a soldier , or a Captain . That 's not a good job for a Jew . " That 's what it needs  --  so they 'll know his mother was n't for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MORRIS Was for it . ZINA All right . So things were n't like that in the real story  --  but in a play  --  who will you get to believe that a real Jewish mother  --  ? MORRIS For God 's sake ! Alfred Dreyfus 's mother was not a real Jewish mother . She was no kind of a Jewish mother . ZINA She was n't ? MORRIS No . ZINA So why 're we putting on this piece of shit ? MORRIS Because  --  what I 'm trying to tell you is that the Dreyfuses in France in 1895 , they were not the same kind of Jews that we are  --  here in Poland in 1931 . They were French . They felt as French as all the other French . Why not ? Alfred Dreyfus had no trouble in the French schools  --  and his father was n't a little tailor  --  his father was big  --  a mill owner . Textiles . ZINA So that 's not Jewish ? I 'll bet you whatever you want his parents cried when he joined that army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , but also not really little either . More or less in the middle . He 's in Lodz . He 's more or less of a kind of cousin . So . He has two sons . And never , never , never  --  that I can swear  --  never would he let one of his sons  --  he had two  --  be in the military  --  even in the French military . p. 13 MORRIS Now listen to me  --  I mean all of you . The way I 've been listening to you . In this play I do n't want to talk about Dreyfus 's parents or about Zola 's family . I want to show how  --  in a highly civilized country where Jews felt secure  --  safe  --  how suddenly  --  you might even say overnight  --  on account of one terrible mistake  --  there started an anti-Semitic campaign  --  and grew and developed to a point where the whole country was divided into two camps  --  and all good sense and all justice was swept away  --  drowned . ARNOLD ( Applauding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That 's what you want to say ? MORRIS Well , try at least . ARNOLD Excellent Now . Let me tell you then the best way to say that . You have a meeting  --  right here to this hall without setting up the stage , and so forth . You can have it with or without a buffet , with or without an orchestra . You come on , you say your say the way you said it just now to us  --  no tra la la , no frills  --  you develop your idea , deliver your messag for , say half an your , wath or without notes Then after , everybody can dance if they want  --  or the old people can talk and ask questions  --  with or without answers . And then  --  about 9:30 , 10 o'clock  --  everybody goes home happy . But a thing like your thing  --  with no music and instead  --  what  --  letters , memos , shmemos , appeals , counter-appeals , trials , re-trials  --  and who knows and what else  --  feh ! First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will believe it . You want an advice ? Try it out first in the street . Ask somebody  --  anybody , if they ever even heard of this Jewish Captain who got himself into trouble in France  --  when ?  --  thirty-five years ago . Ask ! And you know what they 'll say ? They 'll say . " Who cares ? He had no business being a French Captain . Whatever happened , good for him ! " And they 'll be right . p. 14 MORRIS And what if I tell them that last week , thirty miles from here  --  not even thirty  --  a gang of Polish patriots beat up some Polish Jews . Yes . And burned down their houses-after first naturally ransacking them and taking whatever was worth anything . What will they say ? " Well , that wo n't happen here , not to us , because we know how to stay in our place " ? We have no place  --  anywhere  --  as long as this kind of stupidity and hate lives in man . A question . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He 'd never seen him . He was n't even Jewish himself . So why ? For his own sake ? No . He was fighting stupidity and hatred and pre-judice and listen  --  hear me out  --  as long as men do n't do what Zola did , as long as they say , " Aaah , to hell with what happens to others "  --  then nothing will go right-anywhere-and not only for Jews . All men  --  and women - they must love and respect each other  --  or try  --  and that 's what Zola tells them in my play . Love . ZINA ( Singing . ) " Love , love I love you only , My heart is true . " MORRIS Exactly ! ARNOLD Pish-pash ! MORRIS Yes , and if you do n't like it  --  we 'll do it without you ! p. 15 ARNOLD Why are you upset ? Of course I like it . Your play is good . Maybe very good . So you want to say things that are good , why not ? That 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  sitting in front of us  --  if they come , that is  --  will they understand what they can do about it all ? Listen . About ten years ago  --  maybe eleven  --  I was playing with Blomski 's Troupe in Warsaw . In some farkockte play  --  I ca n't ever remember the title  --  and I must tell you  --  I played a terrible son of a bitch  --  MENDL Ha ! That Blomski , always type-casting . ARNOLD Well , this son of a bitch I played was always beating his wife  --  for no reason  --  and in one scene a man comes in  --  a neighbor  --  and he asks him , " What are you beating your wife ? Why ? " And the dirty bastard  --  my part  --  answers : " So whose wife should I beat ? " And you know what the audience did ? MENDL They laughed . ARNOLD Wrong . They applauded . You hear me ? Applauded . It was the biggest moment in that whole farkockte play , I ca n't even remember the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  by nature  --  are cruel and selfish  --  and do n't want to love each other . Or respect . p. 16 ZINA Maybe in Warsaw , but not here . ARNOLD Here , too , like everywhere . ZINA No , not everywhere , not here . ARNOLD Everywhere . Idiots and sons of bitches everywhere ! ( Morris throws his script between Zina and Arnold . ) MORRIS The rehearsal is over ! Good night , ladies and gentlemen . ( He leaves . ) ARNOLD What , I said something ? ( Mendl picks up Morris 's script and runs out after him . The rest stand about in confused silence . As the lights go down , music begins : " Spatzieren . " The music continues for two choruses until the beginning of the next scene. ) p. 17 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT I : SCENE ii Zalman , an old , bearded man is at the stove , stoking the fire . He is the caretaker of these premises . Michael has come in and is studying his lines . MICHAEL Zalman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To tell you the truth , I 'm not sure . My father was never in a hurry to register our births . He 'd wait till there were three or four so he 'd only have to make one trip . But anyway  --  in 1895 , I was between twenty-five and thirty  --  say twenty-eight . MICHAEL Ah hah ! so you must 've heard a lot of talk about Captain Dreyfus . ZALMAN About who ? MICHAEL Captain Alfred Dreyfus  --  this Jewish captain  --  in France  --  who had a lot of trouble there at the time  --  ZALMAN Yes  --  could be . So what about it ? MICHAEL Nothing  --  just that Morris has written this play about him  --  and we 're going to put it on . ZALMAN An old story like that ? MICHAEL Morris wants to point out that even as a Captain  --  a Jew is n't safe from getting peed on  --  p. 18 ZALMAN A whole play he wrote for this ? MICHAEL He 's trying to show that as long as people do n't share respect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Dreyfus affair and pogroms and all kinds of other filthy , inhuman things like that  --  if they do n't love each other . ZALMAN Why should they love each other ? ( A silence . ) Did you say the Dreyfus affair ? Yeh , yeh . There was some talk about it and then some time went by and listen  --  we had our own troubles , who needed French ones ? I must have been still in Crakow then  --  yeh  --  up till 1902 . And you did n't have to be a Captain there to have a hard time  --  so we forgot about all that faraway nonsense . ( Morris comes in , hangs up his coat and stops to listen to Michael and Zalman . ) MICHAEL But what did you think about it ? You were twenty-eight , after all . ZALMAN ( He thinks hard . ) Nothing Mind you  --  at the end  --  when they pardoned him  --  we all got good and drunk all the same . At that time , any occasion was an excuse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's all rusty . MORRIS ( Coming over the Michael . ) So tonight the letter scene . Do you know it ? p. 19 MICHAEL The words , yes  --  but I still have n't found the character . Why did he do what he did ? MORRIS Do n't you see  --  during the degradation  --  at the very moment they 're ripping off his braid  --  he 's still a captain in the Army of the French Republic . All around him  --  the troops in full dress , the music , the ceremony  --  all that is the Army , his Army that he served and still loves . And even after  --  without his rank , without his sabre , he still feels himself to be a soldier among other soldiers . But then he hears the shouts from the crowd  --  " Dirty Jew ! death , death to all Jews ! " The journalists begin to shout , too . The soldiers join in  --  and the officers  --  you hear ?  --  the officers  --  his old comrades  --  all shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only then everything falls in on him , collapses ; honor , rank  --  he does n't know where he is , who he is  --  he 's falling , falling  --  the sabre is broken , the epaulets and buttons ripped off  --  he feels naked  --  and the noise of the crowd finally tears his spirit to shreds Understand ? MICHAEL Yes well , no . Maybe . I mean how does all that help me ? To find the character ? MORRIS God Almighty ! He 's no longer a Captain . He 's no longer a soldier . He 's no longer a Frenchman . He 's nothing ! His army has just banished him  --  thrown him out as though he were the plague . He 's not a character , he 's a person  --  like you . Like me . In trouble . He does n't know who 's accusing him or what he 's accused of . He 's a Jew . Can he help that ? Is it his fault he was born a Jew ? No . But that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lost , screwed ! Yes ! Life has screwed him . If you do n't  --  ( Arnold comes in with his daughter , Myriam . She is attractive in a small-town way , and possessed of unmistakable sexual magnetism. ) p. 20 ARNOLD " Present arms ! At ease ! " ( To Michael . ) How 's it going , boychick ?

MORRIS Good  --  but tonight we 're rehearsing only Dreyfus and his wife ARNOLD And me ? MORRIS I 'm doing what was scheduled . ( Confidentially . ) Anyway , you do n't need as much rehearsal as the others . ARNOLD ( Loudly , bringing it out in the open . ) Excuse me , Morris , but I do n't agree with you . Because one actor is better than the rest does n't mean he does n't have to MORRIS Your turn 'll come .

Read your letter . Places , please , ( Michael and Myriam go to their chairs . ) A bit closer . ( They move . ) Now . Have confidence , children .

For my part , dear love , my thoughts are all of you  --  night and day.To be innocent , to have led a blameless life and to see myself condemned for the most monstrous crime that a soldier can commit  --  what could be more dreadful !

MICHAEL The trouble is  --  one of the troubles  --  that during the day , when I work  --  I sit like this  --  all hunched over . ( He leans over and mimes a shoemaker 's actions . ) And that 's bad for the character . A captain sits up straight , does n't he ? ARNOLD Aw-haw ! Of course . Chest out , eyes front , toches tight  --  like a Polish policeman giving an eviction order to some poor Yiddle . MORRIS ( To Michael . ) So who 's stopping you from sitting up straight ? MICHAEL I tried it . I hit my fingers  --  ( He demonstrates. )  --  but that was nothing . The work was a disgrace .

( He rises . ) No , you ca n't make shoes with a straight back and a chest out and a tight toches . MORRIS Who says Dreyfus sat up straight when he wrote this letter ? And besides  --  it 's not a matter of a stiff back or eyes front  --  you find the character  --  from the inside  --  then the body follows naturally ! So . Again . And this time  --  a little more  --  ( He makes a vague gesture. ) p. 23 MICHAEL I 'm trying , Morris , I 'm trying , but  --  ( He makes the same vague gesture . ) MYRIAM Michael , think about your wife  --  and how you love her  --  and how you 're separated from her . And now you 're writing to her . ( Michael looks at Myriam furtively but meaningfully . He goes back to his letter .

What a consolation that in the midst of our awful misfortune  --  they are so young , so innocent Our Pierre talks about you with such feeling that I can not hold back my tears Your Lucie . " p. 24 MORRIS Good . All right , let 's take it from the ending . You get up . You go to each other . ( They do so . ) You stop , face to face  --  ( They do. )  --  almost touching . There !

MYRIAM ( Moving backward , her arms outstretched toward Michael . ) " My love , my love Alfred " MICHAEL ( Tonelessly . ) " Lucie my Lucie My love my love . " MORRIS No ! No ! ( He walks away , them back . He goes to Michael . ) Are you made of wood  --  or what ? MICHAEL I 'm no actor and I 'm no soldier  --  so it 's no use ! ( He throws his script down on the table , then goes to get his scarf . ) MORRIS Wait ! I 'm sorry . I do n't always mean what I say . ( He tries to take Michael 's scarf away from him . ) And what ? We 're doing it tomorrow ? We 've got all the time in the world . It 'll come  --  you 'll see . Anyway , in this scene  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a man  --  just a man separated from his wife . They 've only been allowed to see each other for a few moments . They could n't even touch , there was a partition . They only had time to say a few tense words , and then  --  the visit was over  --  they parted  --  I mean they were parted  --  they shouted out their love  --  and that 's all . p. 25 MICHAEL I know , I know . ( He makes a helpless gesture . Morris begins pacing again . A pause . ) ARNOLD Morris ? MORRIS Yes ? ARNOLD No , nothing . MORRIS Well , go ahead  --  as long as we 've stopped . ARNOLD Could n't he resign ? MORRIS Who ? ARNOLD Whatshisname . ( He points to Michael . ) Alfred Whatshisname . When he saw how things were going worse and worse for him  --  he could n't send a letter to his General ? They did things like that  --  I 've read about it someplace " Dear General Soandso : As long as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we prolong this matter that 's as painful for me as for you ? So I 'm sending you therefore here-with or however-my resignation  --  definitely  --  goodbye Army . Please accept my best wishes , Shalom , good health to you and Mrs. General , kiss my ass  --  respectfully yours . Captain Whatshisname . " MORRIS For that you interrupt my rehearsal ? ARNOLD A silence I interrupted  --  with permission to speak . p. 26 MORRIS All right , but close your mouth now , will you ? ARNOLD ( Rising . ) What I started to say  --  you did n't let me finish  --  is why is it we never think of the most simple things ? What 's complicated ? He sends in his resignation like I said  --  it 's all over  --  and hooray  --  we can put on another play . MORRIS Michael ! MICHAEL Yes ? MORRIS Go take Myriam in your arms . MICHAEL What for ? MORRIS What for . She 's your wife  --  yes or no ? ARNOLD What 's happening ? MORRIS ( Pushing Michael toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated , we have to see them happy . Together . ARNOLD One daughter I 've got with a beautiful education and he 's pushing her together with a shoemaker . MORRIS ( To Michael , who holds back . ) What 's the matter ? MICHAEL Well , it 's just that  --  MYRIAM ( Holding out her arms tantalizingly . ) Are we going to rehearse or not ? p. 27 MICHAEL ( As he is being propelled . ) In the play they 're never  --  yes , they 're married  --  but always apart  --  so  --  MORRIS Do it . ( Myriam and Michael are in embrace . She is enjoying it , he is embarrassed . ) MICHAEL ( To Arnold . ) Excuse me , Arnold , but  --  ARNOLD Go ahead . Either we 're people of the theatre or not . MORRIS ( To Michael . ) Hold her closer  --  closer  --  what 're you afraid of ? She wo n't bite you . ( Myriam playfully bites his ear . ) Tender , be tender . Let yourself go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , you 're her husband  --  you love each other  --  ( He presses them together at the hips . ) You 're happy  --  you have children  --  life is wonderful  --  you 're rich , handsome , you own horses . Stroke her hair , you love her hair . ( He takes Michael 's hand and shows him how to stroke Myriam 's hair . ) There . Everything is perfect . Tender  --  tender  --  tender for Godsake ! ( Softly . ) Now kiss her . ( Arnold clears his throat nervously . Morris silences him with a gesture. ) p. 28 MICHAEL How about tomorrow when I  --  ? ( Myriam does not let him finish . She kisses him on the mouth , passionately . Michael resists at first , but soon responds . Arnold looks on , speechless . ) MORRIS ( Acting the part of the guard . ) " The visit is over ! " ( Michael and Myriam continue to kiss . ) ARNOLD ( He has had enough . ) " The visit is over ! " MORRIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Michael , with a dazed grin , nods slowly . ) MICHAEL Yeah . MORRIS ( Triumphant . He grabs Michael and hugs him . ) Good  --  now  --  while we 've got the mood  --  let 's do it  --  the letter scene . Go on , Michael  --  read your letter  --  read it like you mean it  --  do n't think of anything but your wife 's kiss  --  let yourself go . Go on , Michael . MICHAEL ( Walking over to Arnold . ) My dear Arnold , I have the honor to ask you for your daughter 's hand in marriage . Myriam ! For life ! MYRIAM ( Throwing her arms around Michael , kissing him , and crying . ) You did it ! Oh , Michael ! You did it ! ( They are in a kiss that seals it . Arnold goes to Morris and looks at him , balefully. ) p. 29 ARNOLD Some director ! ( The lights dim to black . Music is heard : a freilich version of " Tomorrow , Tomorrow . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ACT ONE : SCENE iii The schmatta is lit for day . Music from the previous scene continues as the curtain rises to reveal Michael and Myriam . The hall . Michael and Myriam are alone , deep in a kiss . It ends . MYRIAM ( Acting . ) " The visit is over !

( They relax . ) Good , darling . Very good . MICHAEL I do n't know  --  I still ca n't swallow the whole story . The scenes on Devil 's Island or in prison  --  fine . I can handle those . But when he starts in about his love for the flag and France and the Army  --  I 'm lost . MYRIAM But  --  MICHAEL So calm , polite , why ? Why did he become a Captain ? So he could wear that elegant uniform ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la France ! Vive l'Arme ! " ( He points his forefinger at his temple and whirls it about . ) Farchootzed ! Your Dreyfus was farchootzed. p. 31 MYRIAM Suppose you had a home and a family and they were attacked  --  MICHAEL Yes ? MYRIAM Would n't you fight to protect them ? MICHAEL If I could find the courage  --  I 'd take them and run . MYRIAM But you ca n't keep running . What kind of life is that ? MICHAEL Did n't you hear your own father ? ( He imitates Arnold . ) " Keep your toothbrush in your pocket and stay near your children because you never know what could happen ! " ( Myriam laughs . ) No . I 'll never be able to play this part . But I 'm not sorry I got into it . It taught me a good lesson : the worst thing that can happen to a Jew is for him to feel at home somewhere . Anywhere . MYRIAM Oh , so we 're never going to settle down ? MICHAEL Who said anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall go . " A wife must follow her husband . MICHAEL Who said anything about marriage ? MYRIAM You did , boychick . And in public ! MICHAEL Do you have witnesses ? p. 32 MYRIAM ( Smiling and holding out her arms . ) Come here . ( He moves to her . She swings on him in an attempt to slap him , he ducks , she is thrown off balance . He grabs her from behind . They wrestle , laughing . He pushes her on to the floor , and they go into a long kiss . Arnold and Zina come in . ) ZINA Mazel tov ! ( Michael and Myriam get to their feet , embarrassed . ) When 's the honeymoon ? ARNOLD I think they just had it ! ( Zalman comes in , escorting a tall , dignified man . The stranger is beautifully dressed in black . ) ZALMAN What 're you doing here , all of you ? ARNOLD What we do every night , you old billygoat . ZALMAN Go ' way . No rehearsal tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) MENDL Stop noodging . You 'll have them  --  all hand-tailored  --  nothing by machine . ARNOLD ( To Morris . ) Did you hear that ? No rehearsal tonight . ZALMAN ( To Morris . ) I told you : " Morris , this Monday the hall is for a meeting . A lecture . " p. 33 MORRIS So ? ZALMAN So . Here he is . The lecture . ( He indicates the visitor by way of introduction . All nod or bow slightly . The visitor is somewhat nervous , embarrassed . ) DR . WASSELBAUM ( Introducing himself . ) Doctor Wasselbaum . I ca n't tell you how very sorry I am to steal your auditorium , as it were . MORRIS ( To Zalman . ) So we ca n't rehearse , huh ? ( To Wasselbaum . ) I 'm not talking to you , sir . DR . WASSELBAUM Doctor Wasselbaum . MORRIS What time is this thing ? Your lecture ? ( Zalman is arranging the benches , setting up the table with a pitcher of water and glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat earlier to familiarize myself with the acoustics . ZINA Pish-pash . DR . WASSELBAUM It 's actually my first lecture  --  and  --  I 'm a bit nervous  --  you people  --  theatre people  --  must know . ARNOLD You 've got stagefright ? DR . WASSELBAUM Well , in a manner of speaking  --  yes . p. 34 ARNOLD ( To the others . ) He 's got stagefright . ( To Wasselbaum . ) How about a rehearsal ? For you  --  not for us . DR . WASSELBAUM By all means . ARNOLD ( To the others . ) He wants a rehearsal . MORRIS That 's not the rehearsal I 'm interested in . Good evening doctor . The hall is yours . ( They all start to leave . ) DR . WASSELBAUM Please . I accept your kind offer of assistance . ARNOLD You want a little direction ? DR . WASSELBAUM In a manner of speaking , yes . ( They all look at Morris . He is not interested , but stops at the door . The rest stop around Wasselbaum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Your little chat is about what , exactly ? DR . WASSELBAUM The Promised Land . ( A whistle of admiration . ) MENDL A good subject . ARNOLD Interesting , interesting . ZINA And The Promised Land means what ? Biribidjan , New York , Palestine ? Siberia ? p. 35 DR . WASSELBAUM The actual place does not matter . According to Theodore Herzl 's definition , there is only one Jewish State , and that is The Promised Land . The Jewish State , sovereign and independent . MENDL ( To Arnold . ) Oi , oi , oi  --  a Zionist ! We 'll never get the hall back . ZINA The Jewish State . Hoorah ! But where is the Jewish State ? DR . WASSELBAUM In the heart of each one of us . ZINA Good . At least it wo n't get cold there . DR . WASSELBAUM In a manner of speaking , that is the theme of my lecture  --  how this State we carry in our hearts can become tomorrow  --  a glorious reality . I expound  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the admirable devotion of a handful of pioneers  --  our brave brothers who are preparing for us  --  down there  --  the great return . ZINA Where 's " down there " ? ARNOLD Palestine . Where do you think ? MORRIS Personally , I do n't want to return anywhere . Better to try and get  --  as Jews and equal human beings  --  the rights and obligations like any other persons . In whatever country chance and our parents landed us . Or is that asking too much ? p. 36 MICHAEL You mean like the rights Dreyfus got in France ? MORRIS He ended up a Colonel , did n't he ? Anyway , Jews are n't the only ones to worry about . Hate is n't healthy for anybody , and if some day the anti-Semites could some way be cured-the world would be better off . DR . WASSELBAUM ( To Michael . ) My dear young man , you spoke of Dreyfus . Do you know that it is precisely because of this dreadful Dreyfus affair that Theodore Herzl  --  who chanced to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independent Jewish State ? And if one day this dream is achieved we shall owe it to the ordeal , to the suffering of Captain Alfred Dreyfus . MICHAEL And in your State there  --  there 'll be an Army ? DR . WASSELBAUM I beg your pardon ? MICHAEL Soldiers , officers , guns , cannons  --  an Army ? DR . WASSELBAUM I ca n't say  --  I suppose so  --  like other countries , no doubt . It will be a country , like any other . ZINA For the Jews , a country like any other ? So what 's the use of being Jewish ? DR . WASSELBAUM You must understand p. 37 ZALMAN Can I just finish the hall before you start fighting ? ARNOLD A moment , please . We have n't done our rehearsal with the doctor . ( To Wasselbaum . ) Tell us quick your whole spiel and we 'll tell you quick how to do it . DR . WASSELBAUM Very grateful . ARNOLD Just sing out your whole megilla . DR . WASSELBAUM I beg your pardon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit . ) DR . WASSELBAUM You 're really too kind . I have already delivered a few lectures  --  but in Switzerland and in English . When I said first , I meant my first in the Yiddish tongue . ( He goes up on the platform and begins to prepare by taking out voluminous notes , setting up a map , pouring a glass of water . He takes off his hat . The men follow suit . He then puts his hat back on after putting on his glasses . The men are surprised , but do the same . He appears to have misplaced his speech , but finds it . He stares up at the ceiling to compose his thoughts . The others do the same . All are unnerved . ) ZINA ( Crossing to sit near Arnold , in a stage whisper . ) How do you like it so far ? p. 38 DR . WASSELBAUM My very dear brothers ARNOLD ( Jumping up and interrupting . ) May I ? Let me tell you first something very important . Here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it 's a play or a lecture or a bar mitzvah . They talk . So unless you say , " Quiet , please . Quiet , please ! " And clear your throat like this ( He clears his throat noisily . ) If not they wo n't even begin to listen . Your opening line . What is it ? DR . WASSELBAUM " My very dear brothers . " ARNOLD " My very dear brothers , " huh ? ( He obviously does n't think very much of the line . ) Anyway , you have to say it in a strong voice  --  not quiet  --  not into your beard  --  not subdued . You have to let them know you 're starting , that you 're off with a boom , boom , boom . ( In a very strong voice . ) " My very dear brothers ! " You see ? MORRIS No , no , no . You sound like a drunken wagon-driver insulting his horses . ( To Wasselbaum . ) You do n't have to yell . You said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was missing was conviction . Con-vic-tion ! It did n't sound like you were addressing your very dear brothers . Not to me. p. 39 ZINA And why " My very dear brothers " ? ( She is now on the platform . ) What does that mean , " My very dear brothers " ? They 're not his brothers . And it leaves out women . Why not , " Good evening , people , " or " Hello , everybody " ? MENDL ( Joining Wasselbaum on the platform . ) You know what 's good ? " Welcome , comrades . " There was this speaker , talker , something  --  I heard him one day , two or three years ago , I ca n't remember exactly and I ca n't remember where it was or what it was about  --  but that part I remember , " Welcome , comrades . " I can still hear it . " Welcome , comrades . " ARNOLD Hey , dumkopf ! " Welcome , comrades " means  --  either he was a Bundist or else a Bolshevik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Zionist ca n't say it ? ZINA " Welcome , comrades " right away you think of Biribidjan and Little Father Stalin wants us all to go there and dig rocks . ARNOLD Wait ! ZINA Start with " Welcome , comrades " and you 'll see , they 'll stand up and get the hell out of the hall and barricade themselves in their houses . MENDL To me , " My very dear brothers " sounds like right away a collection . ( To Wasselbaum . ) You 're going to ask for money ? ( Wasselbaum , lost , does not reply . The whole onslaught is too much for him . Zina shouts. ) p. 40 ZINA Are you ? DR . WASSELBAUM That depends on the local committee , not me . They are in charge of details . In a manner of speaking . My role is merely to  --  ARNOLD My God ! He 's right . The local committee . I 'm on it . I forgot . ZINA You 're a Zionist ? ARNOLD Why not ? ZINA You 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me in the desert with those savages ? ( Zina laughs . ) DR . WASSELBAUM Not desert exactly , no . And as for the savages , we have excellent relations with them  --  excellent  --  with some of them . We love them and some day they 're going to love us . MYRIAM We still do n't know how the Doctor 's going to start his speech . ARNOLD You 're right . She 's right . I forgot . MICHAEL How about , " Good evening , ladies and gentlemen " ? ARNOLD No , no . " Ladies and gentlemen " could only be goyim . Come to think , " My very dear brothers " is n't so bad  --  if you say it with con-vic-tion , the way Morris said , and loud , so that everybody stops talking . p. 41 MENDL ( From upstairs . ) " Dear brothers , " maybe . Shorter . ZINA Why not plain " Brothers " ? ARNOLD Because by itself , it does n't mean anything . ZINA Why not ? ARNOLD " Brothers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verb in " My very dear brothers " ? ARNOLD ( Throwing a small temper tantrum . ) That 's not the same . ZINA Yes , it is ! MORRIS Let him say what he wants . It 's your business ? DR . WASSELBAUM Well , actually , everything you have said  --  in a manner of speaking , I am a bit shaken . It is true " My very dear brothers " is a rather banal  --  in a manner of speaking . Rather outmoded . Perhaps a more lively , more up-to-date locution ? MENDL ( From upstairs , where he has , apparently , been to the bathroom . He is buttoning up his fly . ) " Jews ! " ( Arnold jumps a foot and upsets a bench . ) ARNOLD ( To Mendl . ) Lunatic ! p. 42 MENDL " Jews ! " Perfect . ARNOLD I 'm going . MENDL He says , " Jews ! " then goes into his blablabla . That 's not up-to-date ? ZINA Maybe a little shocking ? MENDL To who ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocking . DR . WASSELBAUM Might one suggest " Dear friends " ? ( Zina joins him on the platform once again . ) ZINA " Dear friends " ? You walk in , you do n't know anybody , and right away " Dear friends " ? DR . WASSELBAUM Simply a figure of speech . ZINA In Switzerland , maybe . Here , no . Here it 's hard to make friends . In fact , I have n't got a single one . Anyway , that 's all this about your Jews in Switzerland that speak English ? DR . WASSELBAUM It was the World Congress . ZINA Congress , shmongress . They ca n't talk Yiddish like Everybody else ? MORRIS Doctor . Say what you like in any language you like . What 's important is the sincerity . ( Morris leaves . ) ARNOLD Also good and loud . If not , they talk . p. 43 MENDL If you want , I 'll holler , " Silence , silence ! Shah , Shah ! " while you clear your throat . DR . WASSELBAUM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the local committee plans to make an introduction , in a manner of speaking . ZINA Who 's the Chairman ? ARNOLD Wajsbrot  --  the son . He 's got asthma  --  nobody 'll hear him . ZINA Wajsbrot , the son , is a Zionist ? ARNOLD Why not ? ZINA But before , was n't he  --  ARNOLD What 's the difference what he was before ? What was I before ? ZINA A putz ! And you have n't changed . ZALMAN So . Settled , the opening . Now go and let me please finish the hall . ( Wasselbaum shakes hands with Mendl , then Zina , whose hand he kisses . She likes it so much , she comes back to have him kiss it again . Arnold 's turn . ) DR . WASSELBAUM From the bottom of my heart , may I  --  ARNOLD Please , Doctor , nothing . If Jews ca n't help each other , who will ? You 're in a great cause , Doctor . My respects . ( They embrace . Then to Zina as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuck up the whole thing . ( The lights dim to black . Music : " Mezinkah " 3 choruses , which continues into the beginning of the next scene. ) p. 44 p. 45 Act 1 , Scene 4 ACT ONE : SCENE iv As the schmatta rises , the members of the company enter , dancing . They set up the benches to indicate Dreyfus 's prison cell . Inside it , a makeshift stool and cot . Michael lies on the " cot " and stares at the ceiling . Mendl stands outside the " cell " waiting for his cue . The company watches . Michael , on a signal from Morris , gets up , sits for a moment , head in hands  --  then begins moving about , restlessly . Morris gives Mendl a hand cue . Mendl stamps over with military precision , pretends ( with sound effects ) to be opening the " prison " door . He enters . Michael and he salute each other . MORRIS Go ! MENDL " Captain Dreyfus , I trust that you wish to spare our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle of dragging an officer of Staff Headquarters of the French Army before a military tribunal for the foul crime of high treason . I hope you have at least the courage to accept the consequences by seeing that justice is done  --  not by forcing your Army or your country to lower itself to punishment but by atoning for your sins in the way of an officer and a gentleman . " ( He reaches into his pocket and brings forth a wooden revolver . Michael , on a hand cue from Morris , recoils . Mendl slaps the revolver down on the stool , salutes again . Michael returns the salute mechanically . Mendl leaves , closes the door , making the creaking sound again . He looks ever to Morris for approval , then returns to where he had started from . Michael moves to the stool , stares down at the revolver . He looks up , trying to remember his next line. ) p. 46 ARNOLD ( Prompting . ) " They want me to kill myself . " MICHAEL " They want me to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause . ) ARNOLD "  --  justice . " MICHAEL Ah ! ( Myriam runs over with his script and he starts to read . ) " But what have I done ? My Chief orders me to put an end to myself  --  and as a good soldier , I should obey , but why ? Why ? Is this justice ? Why does he wish me dead ? For the good of our country , did he say ? My country wishes me dead ? " ( All the time he is reading , Arnold is mouthing the lines at the same time . Michael picks up the revolver , looks at it for a moment , puts it to his temple , hesitates , then all at once , throws it to the floor . ) MORRIS AND ARNOLD Bang ! ! ( Mendl , off , makes an exultant sound and rushes into the cell . He forgets to pantomime the opening of the ' cell ' door . He rushes out again , makes his creaking sound again , and enters . He stops , shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! So . I might have known ! This is what the French Army must suffer when it makes the mistake of accepting your kind into its ranks : dishonor , shame ! " p. 47 MICHAEL ( From his script . Arnold is still mouthing the words . ) " You , Commander , talk of dishonor ? You ? You who accuse an innocent man of high treason ? You who insist that I take my life  --  when I have done nothing ? I am no coward . I will face military justice . And France ? I am ready to lay down my life for her-but in the face of the enemy  --  like a soldier  --  not like this , like a coward ! No ! " MENDL " Put the handcuffs on this traitor . " MORRIS Mendl , please MENDL What " please " ? MORRIS Make at least some kind of  --  any kind of gesture . MENDL What " gesture " ? To who ? Nobody 's there ! MORRIS There will be . There 'll be standing there a soldier  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and he comes with the handcuffs . MENDL So why is n't he there why ? MORRIS Later . MENDL So I 'll do the gesture later . MORRIS Oh , for God 's sake ! MENDL Not only do I have to play all the son of a bitches  --  but I get bawled out for not making a gesture to somebody is n't even there ! ( He sighs , then makes an exaggerated gesture . ) " Put the handcuffs on this traitor ! " So . Satisfied ? p. 48 MICHAEL ( Reading . ) " Handcuffs ? On me ? An officer in the French Army . How can I live through such an outrage ? Commander , on my honor , on my wife , on my children  --  I deny all these accusations ! " MORRIS Good . We 'll stop now for a minute . ARNOLD Thank God ! A glass of tea . ( The company lends a hand , setting up the table for tea . ) Tea is all right , but it 's not vodka . Hey , Zalman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't need it . But anybody wants to bring some  --  let them . MORRIS ( To Arnold . ) So how 's the scenery ? Finished ? ARNOLD Almost all built . Now we 're painting , Zina and me , painting , painting . ZINA Every night , painting . ( They sip their tea . Michael , studying his script , seems discouraged . Morris slaps him on the back . ) MORRIS We 're coming along  --  little by little . Some good things in it already  --  like what we just did . MICHAEL I did n't even know it . MENDL You 'll see . When we 'll have the real  --  p. 49 MORRIS Please , do n't say it ! MENDL The costumes always help ! MORRIS When will they be ready ? MENDL Trust me . You 'll be very happy . MORRIS You 're using those prints ? MENDL Who , me ? MORRIS Who else ? With my own money I bought them  --  sent from France ! Have you had a look at them ? ( Mendl coughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? MORRIS Will the uniforms look like the ones in those prints ? MENDL Why do they have to look like that ? Old prints , half-mouldy  --  you want half-mouldy uniforms ? MORRIS Those are authentic , valuable prints . French officers in 1895 dressed like that . So you 'll make them like that  --  style , form , color ! MENDL Oi vay ! ( To Zina . ) A little sugar , please ? MORRIS What do you mean , " Oi vay " ? ( Mendl sips a mouthful of tea through a sugar cube , then speaks . ) MENDL I mean : the style , yes . The color , no. p. 50 MORRIS Are you crazy ? ( To the others . ) He 's crazy ! ( To Mendl . ) I bought those prints so you 'd have a model . MENDL How would you like me to bring you a real director so you 'll have a model ? MORRIS The uniforms were a certain blue . They must be this certain blue . We have to respect historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had  --  for years  --  a bolt of red wool . A bolt of blue wool I have not got . That 's a real historical fact . So your uniforms will be red . ( To all . ) A good color for officers , no ? ( Some approve , some do not . ) MORRIS Red ? MENDL Well , not really red ! More like , say  --  garnet . But not a pissy garnet . A regular garnet garnet . ( He laughs . ) MORRIS You 're making fun of me , huh ? MENDL Look at him  --  look ! Anybody 'd think I just threw a dead cockroach in his tea . Red , my dear sir . Red , with padded epaulets and gold fringe . The kind of uniform that if a dwarf put it on , he 'd feel like a giant ! ( Going over to Michael . ) As soon as he puts it on , this one , the character will come up out of his gizzard and he 'll holler out : " Innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dress rehearsal we 'll all start in to cry . The costume makes the theatre . The rest is bupkes ! p. 51 MORRIS Your bolt of red wool , or as you say , garnet garnet ? MENDL Yes ? MORRIS I 'll tell you what to do . Keep it stored , very careful , in napthaline , yes ?  --  till the next play  --  and then you can use it . In fact , we 'll choose the play especially for the color of your material . ( His voice rising . ) But for this play  --  for " Dreyfus "  --  I want blue uniforms . Blue ! Blue ! ! Like in the French prints ! MENDL Is this some kind of a craze with you , or what ? MORRIS The uniforms of the soldiers and officers in France in 1895 were  --  MENDL Do n't tell me ! Let me guess ! Blue ? Right ! Blue . But who  --  except you and me  --  ever saw your farkockte prints ? So if we use the garnet everybody will say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear garnet . " And if some nudnick hollers out : " Hey , stop ! French 1895 soldiers wore blue ! " They 'll think he 's crazy and throw him out of the hall ! And what 's the difference ? Blue , garnet , black , gray , green , yellow  --  what ? A louse is still a louse . And a soldier is still a soldier whatever color the poor son of a bitch 's got on his back . He can get blown to bits in any color . ( Morris loses his temper and attacks Mendl , grabbing him by the throat . Arnold , Michael , Myriam and Zalman try to separate them. ) p. 52 MORRIS Blue ! I want them blue ! You hear ? Blue ! You bring me red or your goddamn garnet garnet garnet and I 'll stuff ' em up your ass ! MENDL ( Freed . ) All right already ! I was only trying to give an advice . When did I start in being a tailor ? Today , maybe ? And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Would you be surprised if I told you I 've made robes for priests ? You 're surprised , eh ? And with that same garnet ! Yes . And not some little schlemiel priest . Oh , no ! A big hoo-hah priest . High up . And you lose your control  --  and grab me by the throat and turn into a mad bull . You should be ashamed ! Maybe what 's good enough for a Cardinal  --  that 's what he was  --  a Cardinal  --  what 's good enough for him is n't good enough for your Jew-bastard spying captain ? You know your trouble ? You live in the clouds . Blue blue blue you holler . So . Well and good . I 'll find you your blue but he 'll never find you his character . And that , my dear sir , is a real historical fact . ( A silence , broken only by the sound of tea being sipped . ) ZALMAN How would it be if the pants were red and the jackets blue ? ARNOLD Bravo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what he wants . How he wants . I do n't give a damn any more . p. 53 MENDL Wait , wait . ( He gets up to measure Michael . ) A yard and a quarter . Three and a half . Yes ! I think it could be . You see , Morris , you talk a question over , you find an answer . ( To Zalman . ) Good , Zalman . Good what you said . MORRIS Let 's take all the scenes with Zola and Mathieu . ARNOLD Zola ! Present ! ( Making the transition to his character . ) " J'accuse ! I accuse ! J'accuse ! " MORRIS ( Setting furniture . ) Where 's Nathan ? ARNOLD Nathan ? MORRIS The one who plays Mathieu Dreyfus  --  Alfred 's brother  --  you 've read the play ? Or not ? ARNOLD ( Offended . To the others . ) Have I read the play he asks me ? MORRIS Where the hell is he ? Nathan . First he begs me for a part , then he never comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) He 's busy . MORRIS And we live on air , maybe ? MENDL It 's not work . He 's training . p. 54 MORRIS What training ? MENDL Shhh ! It 's a secret . Him and a whole group  --  young boys and some not so young  --  they 're all training , how to fight . To fight back . ARNOLD What are you talking ? MENDL A defense group ! ARNOLD But he must be crazy altogether . He 'll get us all in terrible trouble ! I can see it  --  feel it  --  a pogrom , God forbid . Oi , my heart . A chair . Please , a chair . ( Myriam runs over to help him. )  --  it 's getting dark in front of my eyes . MENDL It 's in Lodz , this group , not here . MORRIS But you said Nathan . MENDL His brother has there a store . And his brother asked him to come over and help him in the store , he says  --  but the real reason is they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lions of Zion "  --  and that 's why Nathan  --  ARNOLD " The Lions of Zion "  --  oh , those shmucks ! Those stupid shmucks ! MORRIS So he 's not going to play Mathieu ? MENDL I do n't see how he  --  MORRIS He walks out on us without telling anybody  --  p. 55 MENDL What do you mean ? I 'm anybody  --  and he told me . And he told me to tell you  --  but confidential . He does n't want people to know . Because if his mother  --  Nathan 's mother ever ( Zina makes of gesture of despair and understanding . ) ARNOLD What do they have to stir up trouble , hah ? Then after , they 're surprised when they kicked in the teeth . MENDL ( To Arnold . ) That 's why  --  ARNOLD ( Leaping up . ) Why what , Mr. Goodnewsbringer ? Those " Lions of Zion "  --  they 'll get us all chewed up and spit out ! In this life we have to stay in line and not look for lice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and not try to pass yourself off as a man when you 're really a horseball . MORRIS ( To Mendl . ) And you did n't tell me . MENDL I just did ! MORRIS Two weeks too late ! For two weeks I 'm asking where 's Nathan-Mathieu and everybody makes  --  ( He does a big shrug. )  --  and all the time he 's in Zion . MENDL In Lodz . With this group they call themselves  --  p. 56 MORRIS Say one more word  --  one  --  you 'll be risking your life . You hear ? Your life ! ( An awkward silence . ) ARNOLD Well , do we rehearse ? MORRIS No ! We 've rehearsed enough . ( He walks to the door . ) Ladies and gentlemen . I have a company announcement . You can all consider yourselves free  --  permanently and completely free ! So go home and as far as I 'm concerned  --  stay there ! ( Lights dim to black. ) @x The show curtain is down . Music begins : it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain goes up to reveal Zina and Arnold alone in the hall , painting scenery . She mixes the paint , he applies it . ZINA One thing I still ca n't quite understand . ARNOLD ( Smiling . ) Only one ? ZINA I 've read the play , I 've re-read the play , I 've come to every rehearsal , and yet ARNOLD And yet ? ZINA It 's about Dreyfus  --  Dreyfus himself . ARNOLD A good character  --  big  --  but a little flat . Not too much variety  --  and , of course , he does n't have as much to say as Zola has . At least not with the same depth  --  or power  --  ( He becomes Zola and thrusts that finger again . ) " J'accuse ! " ZINA Oi ! Will you stop yelling like that right in people 's ears ? ARNOLD You like it in French ? Or would it be better  --  " I accuse ! " ZINA Either way , only do n't holler . p. 58 ARNOLD Excuse me. madam . That was not hollering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ringing . ( Arnold goes to her and kisses her ear , tenderly . ) ARNOLD Both ears ? ZINA Both . ( He kisses her other ear . ) ARNOLD ( Sitting down next to Zina on the bench . ) Last night  --  when I got home  --  I was just on the point of telling  --  well , anyhow , talking to Myriam  --  about us . And then , I do n't know . At the last minute  --  I did n't . ZINA You do n't think she knows anyhow ? ARNOLD What makes you  --  ? You believe she would think of me , her father  --  with you ? ZINA Why not ? ARNOLD True . But you understand why I  --  after all , you and me  --  what are we now ? A couple of old-timers , that 's all . ( He begins painting again . ) ZINA I 'm never going to be an old-timer ! ( They work in silence for a few moments , but Zina 's heart is not in it . ) ARNOLD What did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know ? You keep interrupting , and hollering , and after  --  you ask me what I was saying . ARNOLD So from one second to the next you ca n't remember what you were talking about ? ZINA If you did n't keep on interrupting , I 'd remember . Like this , I forgot . ARNOLD That shows how important it must have been . ( Zina shrugs . A silence . They work . ) ZINA Was it about Dreyfus , maybe ? ARNOLD What ? ZINA What I was saying ? ARNOLD Me , she 's asking what she was saying . ZINA Yes ! About Dreyfus . I 'm right . There 's something I ca n't understand ARNOLD I 'm listening with all my ears . ( He sits on the floor at Zina 's feet . ) ZINA What  --  exactly what did he do  --  this schlemiel  --  to get himself into prison and with trials and with the whole mish-mash ? ARNOLD What 're you talking , Mrs. Chicken-head ? He did n't do anything , nothing , he 's innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  innocent like a two-day baby . That 's the play ! p. 60 ZINA You mean innocent like he did n't do it ? Anything ? ARNOLD Of course . ZINA So why did they make him all that so much trouble why ? ARNOLD Why ? Because he 's a Jew  --  that 's why . Jewish . You understand that ? ZINA Jewish ? I think so . Yes . I think I heard that word once or twice . ARNOLD So now you understand , I hope . ZINA What 's to understand ? ARNOLD You said you did n't . ZINA Let me finish . He did n't do anything . He 's innocent . Good . That 's what 's in the play  --  in the play ! Never mind the play . What I want to know  --  what I 'm trying to find out and you ca n't tell me and nobody can  --  is what happened there in Paris ? Not in the play  --  but in Paris ! ARNOLD What happened is what happens in Morris 's goddamn play ! ZINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story he wants should make everybody cry . But me , it wo n't make me cry . I 'm not an innocent like a two-day baby . I know some life . And I know in France , nobody puts a man in prison just because he 's a Jew . Or Jewish . Here , maybe . In France , never . It could n't happen . There would have to have been something going on  --  what , I do n't know  --  but something . Maybe one thing . Even small . Then maybe they could 've exaggerated because he was slightly Jewish  --  I 'm not saying that could n't be . All right , so he was n't a spy . But hot-headed , maybe . Maybe he wanted to be promoted and they would n't let him . Maybe he talked back when he should n't  --  do I know ? Was I there ? But something ! By Morris everything is simple . That 's why Michael ca n't play it . Who could ? It 's not a true-to-life character . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and so on and so . That 's old-fashioned theatre for old-fashioned people . Every character should be hard and soft , white and black  --  if not , he 's a stick , not a person " Motke Goniff " ! Now there 's a role . A bandit , a liar  --  but generous and funny . And the writing , like poetry . Have you read it ? p. 61 ARNOLD When have I got time to read , when ? The whole day I 'm in the shop working , the whole evening I 'm here rehearsing , and the whole night I have to listen to your goddamn ya-ta-ta ya-ta-ta ya-ta-ta ! Morris says that 's how it was and so by me , that 's how it was . ( He gets up off the floor and returns to his painting . ) ZINA What is he , Moses ? What does he know ? He was n't even born in 1895  --  and has he ever been to Paris ? Hah ? ARNOLD And you ? ZINA Me , yes . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Paris ? ZINA Why should I go to Paris when all my relatives are in Belgium ? maybe I 'll go there some day . Who knows ? Maybe I 'll go see them all . " Oi ! Look who 's here ! Auntie Zina ! " " Here I am , all the way from Vilna ! " ARNOLD Go to Belgium , go . Bon voyage . It 's right over there . ( He points . ) Straight ahead and turn left . ZINA And from there , maybe I 'll go to Paris . ARNOLD Go , go ! ZINA And then I 'll find out what really happened there . ARNOLD Of course , Ask any policeman . In the meantime , you 're helping me paint or not ? Like always  --  you 're talking and I 'm  --  Aie ! Aie ! p. 62 ZINA Again your back ? ARNOLD Aie ! Worse than last time . ( He tries to move , pauses . ) I ca n't bend forward ! ZINA So bend backward . ARNOLD Bend  --  what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  all over . ZINA Shooting pains ? ARNOLD Yes  --  aie !  --  yes  --  ZINA On the floor . Quick . Knees on your chest . ARNOLD You want to kill me ? I ca n't  --  ZINA Do it ! Always the same arguments  --  ARNOLD But this time  --  ( She fixes him with a look . He starts for the floor . She helps him . He lies on his back . With great skill , she bends back his knees . He is breathing painfully . ) ZINA Breathe slow  --  slow  --  that 's it  --  slower . ( He breathes , concentratedly . ) Better ? ARNOLD A little . ZINA And the shooting pains ? ARNOLD I do n't know  --  yes , still  --  well , a little less maybe . It 's all right so long as I lay still What if I ca n't get up ? p. 63 ZINA We 'll dig a hole under you and bury you right here . And also  --  when we do the play  --  we 'll be doing it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't forget you . ARNOLD Not funny . ZINA Maybe I 'll take over your part . ( She leans toward him and shouts into his ear , in a bass voice . ) " J'accuse ! ! " ( He jumps . ) ARNOLD Aie ! ( They laugh together . He is suddenly sober . ) Zina ZINA What , my love ? ARNOLD What if it 's my heart ? ( She embraces him . ) ZINA Your heart is not in your back . No , no . It 's the painting . ARNOLD So why do we have to do it ? You and me ? Why not somebody else for a change ? ZINA You do n't remember ? In the beginning , we asked if we could do it together  --  we insisted . Why ? So we could be alone more often . ARNOLD Well , when you 're in love , you get foolish ideas . ( He gets up from the floor . Zina helps him . ) So . I think the time has come when we should pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody younger . p. 64 ZINA You think ? ARNOLD Michael 's got a strong back . No rheumatism . Yet . ZINA And Myriam can still talk to him without him biting her head off . ARNOLD Well  --  you know  --  ( He puts him arm around her . ) They 're still young , huh ? ZINA And still new at it . ( She goes back to work . ) ARNOLD That 's right  --  but listen  --  there 's a lot to be said for  --  hey ! What 're you doing ? ZINA Oh . ARNOLD Come on , my girl . Somebody else 's turn ( They leave , holding one another and walking slowly , like young lovers . Music begins : " Benkilah " 2 choruses as the lights dim to black. ) p. 65 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWO : SCENE vi Martial music is playing softly under most of the following scene . A dress rehearsal . A few painted flats are in evidence ( among them , the one painted by Arnold and Zina in the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sewing machine . Costumes and props are strewn about . The painted flat is raised , revealing Michael , platform center , made up as Captain Dreyfus , complete with trim mustache and pince-nez . He is in full uniform  --  kepi , brass buttons , and decorations . The uniform is garnet garnet . Some of the others wear part of their costume . Mendl is fitting Michael 's costume with excitement . MENDL What about under the arms ? MICHAEL What ? MENDL It bothers you under the arms or what ? MICHAEL ( Moving his arms . ) No  --  not more than any place else . MENDL ( To Zina . ) And the whole everything  --  only three fittings . Three ! ZINA To me it looks like four , the least . MENDL ( Missing the barb . ) Three ! And look how it fits . A miracle , no ? ( Myriam enters in full costume . It is a lovely 1895 creation . She and Michael both suggest characters in an operetta. ) p. 66 MYRIAM ( Moving to stand next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fit ! MORRIS The sleeves not too long ? MENDL Please ! Sleeve length is nothing . Let him first wear it in a little , then we 'll see . ( To Michael . ) Wear it a couple days  --  it should n't look too much like a stage costume , but like the real man 's real uniform . Put it on in the morning the first thing  --  and little by little  --  you 'll begin to feel the character  --  find the character  --  you 'll see  --  MORRIS Maybe he should go out and fight the enemy a few days  --  ZINA ( To Michael . ) You 're already standing better . MICHAEL Because I 'm trying to breathe inside all this . MENDL No , no  --  it 's the big piece whalebone I put there in the back there  --  MICHAEL Whalebone ? ZINA An artificial spine ! ( She laughs . ) MENDL ( Unwrapping a black cloth . ) And now  --  please , everybody watch . Here is the star of the whole show . ( Everyone watches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sabre . ) This , I did n't make . This I rented only . ( He pulls the sabre from its scabbard , raises his knee , and breaks the prop sabre across it . He throws a piece to the floor with a flourish . The company is as delighted as he is . There is a smattering of applause . ) Is that a piece of workmanship ? ( Morris , anxious to try out the new toy , but behaving like a director , takes the sabre and brings it down hard on his thigh . It does not break. ) p. 67 MORRIS Ow ! MENDL No , no . There 's a trick . ( He takes the sabre . ) When you make like this  --  ( He mimes the action. )  --  you push this little jimjick  --  ( He does so. )  --  and kanock ! ( He demonstrates without actually breaking the sabre in half . ) Like that . ( Morris takes it and goes through the whole routine again during the following . ) It 's a real professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael . ) If you would n't be able to find the character with that  --  ( Makes a funny noise . Morris breaks the sabre , using the jimjick . Zina grabs it and does the routine . Throughout the following , everyone in the company has a crack at the sabre . ) MYRIAM ( Studying Michael . ) It 's true what they say about a uniform  --  there 's something  --  I do n't know  --  masculine ? Or what ? ( Michael takes Myriam 's arm . ) MICHAEL How do you do , Mrs. Dreyfus ? MYRIAM Fine , Captain , fine . MICHAEL Call me Alfred . So long as we 're married , you can call me Alfred . ( During this entire exchange Mendl is changing into his costume . His is also garnet garnet , but with twice the decorations of Michael 's . Also , his kepi has a long , black feather decorating it. ) p. 68 MYRIAM Alfred MICHAEL Dear Lucie ( He turns to Morris . ) A husband , that I feel fine . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they catch sight of Mendl changing , and laugh . ) MORRIS Nobody 's asking you to join the Army ! There were a lot of people on Dreyfus 's side did n't like captains any more than you do . There was one  --  the famous anarchist  --  Sebastien Faure  --  you know what he said ? MICHAEL How should I ? MORRIS He said : " Dreyfus , as a captain , is my enemy and I will fight to destroy him . But as a victim of this foul racial attack , I will defend him in the name of decency and humanity ! " MICHAEL So go get your Sebastien Whatever-his-name-is to come and play the part . I 'm sure the uniform will fit him as well as it does me  --  when Mendl makes a uniform it fits anybody ! ZINA What exactly is an anarchist , anyway ? Somebody can maybe tell me ? MENDL Michael  --  the truth  --  it does n't fit ? MICHAEL It fits me fine . The trouble is , I do n't fit it ! The more I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd lived in France at that time  --  I would not have been for Dreyfus. p. 69 ZINA Oi ! Bite your tongue ! How can you say a thing like that , a nice boy like you ? That 's what comes from being too intelligent . You end up saying stupid things ! MICHAEL I 've thought about it more than anybody here . Not about the play  --  but my part  --  Dreyfus . And I now believe that any Jew who enlisted in that Army could have only had one reason  --  spying . MORRIS What ? ! MICHAEL That 's what I believe  --  but . So long as you tell me that , no  --  he was absolutely innocent and that he enlisted because he wanted to be a military man , then he has my contempt and I spit on him ! MORRIS Right now , Michael , I do n't need a philosopher , I need an actor . MICHAEL You need an actor who can feel something  --  MENDL Wait a little  --  you just put it on ! MORRIS No more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going to be with Arnold ? MORRIS With Arnold ? What ? MENDL ( Holding up a garment . ) His costume . He 's not going to try it on ? p. 70 MORRIS He 's not here , so how can he try it on ? MYRIAM Where is he , Zina ? ZINA Me you 're asking ? MORRIS But do n't worry , when the time comes , he 'll show you exactly how to remake it . MYRIAM Maybe he did n't know about tonight ? MORRIS Maybe not . We 're so well organized here  --  like a chicken coop . Mendl  --  you made notes what to do with Myriam 's ? MENDL Yes . MORRIS And with Michael 's ? MENDL Please . MORRIS But you made notes ? MENDL What then ? Nothing . A couple of stitches  --  here , there . And my note book , I ca n't lose . ( He taps his temple and laughs . Arnold comes rushing in . He wears his barber smock with combs and scissors sticking out of various pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myriam goes to him . Off stage is the sound of men 's voices , mumbling threateningly . ) MORRIS Ah-ha ! Welcome , Mr. Zola . On time as usual . Your costume is waiting for you  --  ARNOLD ( Out of breath . ) You do n't know ! You just do n't know ! p. 71 MENDL Your shop burned down and you 've got no insurance ? ( Zina and Mendl laugh . ) ARNOLD You 'll soon stop laughing when I tell you . MORRIS Tell what ? ARNOLD Some things I found out ! MORRIS What things ? Tell already . ARNOLD I came to warn you  --  to help you  --  and the thanks I get ? Jokes and blablabla . MORRIS What is it , Arnold ? ( The off stage voices can still be heard . They will be heard throughout the rest of the scene . ) ARNOLD It 's terrible ! ZINA What is ? ARNOLD A pogrom  --  maybe a pogrom  --  MENDL , MYRIAM AND ZINA Maybe ! ( Arnold looks around . They all draw near . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the butcher 's wife  --  ZINA Avrom or Baruch ? ARNOLD Neither one . The goy butcher  --  the big one near the goy synagogue  --  I mean the church , near  --  p. 72 ZINA Why are you bothering us about some goy butcher ! ? ARNOLD So if you 'll let me finish , so you 'll find out ! MORRIS ( To Arnold . ) Go ahead . ARNOLD Yesterday  --  it was only yesterday  --  this butcher  --  he found out his helper was putting it to his wife  --  to the butcher 's wife  --  MENDL A Jewish helper ? ARNOLD Who said ? MENDL He 's not ? ARNOLD That 's all we need . If he was  --  I 'd be already on the train to Warsaw . This butcher  --  he happens to be a member  --  a big , high-up member  --  of The League for a Pure Poland . MORRIS So what 's that got to do with us ? ARNOLD A man gets mad  --  he 's got to take it out on somebody ! So today  --  a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollering and carrying signs and getting excited . ( Men chanting in the background can be heard . ) MENDL But for years , everything 's been all right  --  well , all right enough . p. 73 ARNOLD  --  putting on a play about the Dreyfus trouble and they ca n't see the same kind of trouble right in front of them . MICHAEL ( Coming downstairs . ) What 's happening right in front of us ? ARNOLD You 'll soon see MORRIS But in the meantime , can we at least rehearse at least ? ARNOLD ( To Morris . ) No . The worst thing I did n't tell you yet . ( They all give him their strict attention . ) How they came to be marching . He went to his priest  --  this butcher  --  and he got him all excited . So this morning , the priest gave a big sermon  --  about morals and patriotism and , of course ,  --  a Pure Poland . And the next thing , they were marching in the streets . MORRIS What can we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ARNOLD ( Rising . ) What , to encourage pogroms ? ZINA Arnold , calm down . You 'll give yourself a heart trouble . And anyway  --  in the end  --  like always  --  what 'll be , ' ll be . ARNOLD All right , let 's rehearse . ( Now , march music can be heard from the street . On the platform , Michael and Mendl , in full dress and under stage lighting , are rehearsing the degradation scene . Myriam , in full costume , is watching . Zina , also in full costume , is waiting for her cue . Arnold is putting on his Zola beard . He then starts walking back and forth. ) p. 74 ZINA " Death to the Jews ! Death to the Jews ! " ( She throws a head of lettuce at Michael 's head . ) MORRIS ( To Arnold . ) What 're you buzz-buzzing around like a lost fly ? You 'd like to go home , maybe ? ARNOLD Too late . You ca n't hear them  --  those hoodlums ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing and drinking  --  then after , the first ones they get ahold of  --  . I 'm staying here . MORRIS Stay as long as you want . Five years ? Five years ! But stay quiet ! ( Arnold sighs and sits , but only for a moment . He gets up and resumes his earlier action . ) ARNOLD Why did n't I go before , why ? Why did I even come , why ? ZINA ( Changing from her costume into a kimono . ) Why why why ? You came because dress rehearsal . Sit by me . I would n't let anybody hurt you . ARNOLD What , I 'm afraid for myself ? It 's for you , for Myriam . You hear ? MORRIS What ? Those drunkards singing ? ARNOLD And that does n't bother you ? MORRIS The street belongs to everybody , no ? p. 75 ARNOLD On Yom Kippur , would I go in their neighborhood , and right under their windows sing a Kaddish ? MORRIS Maybe you should . Maybe if we had more cultural exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ARNOLD Why should I want to exchange anything with them ? All I want is they should leave me the hell alone in my own corner and that 's all ( Out in the street , the men are now singing a song . The melody is " Hatikvah " : " How do you make a Yiddle , a Yid ? You do it in the way that Devil did did ! You take a sick dog that 's vomiting hardYou take a dead cat and rub it with lardAnd then if you want a Yid , a YiddleYou put them together till they start in to diddle ! To diddle ! " ) MORRIS So let 's start again , yes ? ( The singing stops . ) Now Mendl . The important thing , the only thing , is the feeling  --  and the way to do this is  --  ( Violent knocking at the door silences him . The room freezes . They are all , for the moment , petrified . ) A VOICE ( YANEK ) Who 's in there ? ARNOLD ( Whispering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk ! Still ! ( More knocking , as though with a piece of pipe . Whispering more softly but more intensely . ) Do n't answer . ( A pause . More knocking. ) p. 76 THE VOICE ( Yanek ) Hey ! Hey you Yid bastards  --  you going to answer  --  yes or shit ? MORRIS All right , Zalman . Open . ARNOLD You 're crazy or what ? MENDL Maybe Arnold 's right . After all  --  A SECOND VOICE ( BRONISLAW ) Get away ! I 'm going to kick their God damn Jew door in ! THE FIRST VOICE ( YANEK ) You hear that , you circumcised suckers ? ( Prolonged laughter from outside . ) ZALMAN Get away , everybody . Hide . MORRIS Why hide ? What are they , wild animals ? They 're men . We 'll talk to them  --  ARNOLD No , no  --  for God 's sake ! ( The women take charge , and everyone gets out of sight . Zalman is at the door . He flings it open . Two men appear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ZALMAN You 're looking for somebody ? YANEK Look at this old Jew-pig ! He 'd make a good mattress if he were stuffed , would n't he ? BRONISLAW ( Sniffing loudly . ) What 's that stink ? p. 77 YANEK Jew stink ! ( He grabs Zalman . Zalman makes no movement . ) BRONISLAW ( Moving to Zalman . ) Hey , smelly ! What 're you gawking at me for with your yellow Yid eyeballs ? ( Yanek has gone over to the light switch and turns it on . ) ZALMAN Excuse me . I 'm a little hard of hearing . Everybody 's gone  --  so whoever you 're looking for , you should better come back tomorrow , tonight there 's nobody here BRONISLAW ( To Yanek . ) Did he say , " Come back tomorrow " ? I do n't speak Yiddish . ( He steps away , sees Myriam 's picture-hat , picks it up and puts it on . He flounces about . Yanek howls with laughter . Zalman mades a move to grab it and Yanek grabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us for centuries ! And these fingers , all they want is to grope a nice little shiksa  --  is how they say it ? ( Into Zalman 's face . ) You want to grope my wife , huh ? You want to grope his daughter , hah ? I ought to stick a hole in your guts ! BRONISLAW Give me a knife or something  --  but be sure it 's kosher ! You think he 'll bleed or would just a lot of gefilte fish come oozing out ? ( Morris starts out of the hiding place . Mendl pulls him back . Yanek finds Mendl 's large tailoring shears . He gives them to Bronislaw. ) p. 78 BRONISLAW How about ? ( Bronislaw snips the shears down around the general area of Zalman 's sexual organs . Morris can contain himself no more . ) MORRIS ( Emerging . ) That 's enough ! ( The men are startled . They stop and look at him . ) Are n't you ashamed of yourselves ? He 's old enough to be your father ! BRONISLAW Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shears . ) A four-eyed one ! YANEK Did you hear him insult your mother ? BRONISLAW ( To Morris . ) You leave my mother out of this , Foureyes . MORRIS I had no intention of insulting anyone . I believe in brotherhood . BRONISLAW Brotherhood ? ( To Yanek . ) Oh , I know this type . A four-eyed Jew-bastard intellectual . Any minute you 'll hear him  --  " Share and share alike ! " It 's not enough they steal everything  --  now they want to share everything ! ( He punches a sudden , hard punch and hits Morris in the face . He hits him again , in the stomach . Morris falls , badly hurt . His glasses have been knocked off and , on all fours , he tries to find them by patting the floor . ) How did that feel , you four-eyed Jewbastard ? p. 79 MORRIS My glasses  --  please  --  my glasses  --  ( Morris is about to pick up his glasses , when Bronislaw kicks them to Yanek , who crushes them under his heel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Bronislaw begins to snip off chunks of his beard and throw them into the air . From the darkness , from the shadows  --  a figure in garnet emerges . It is Michael . He walks into the beam of one of the still-lit spotlights . ) MICHAEL ( A shout , in a new voice . ) STOP ! ( Yanek and Bronislaw jump . ) I ORDER YOU TO RELEASE THAT MAN AT ONCE ! BRONISLAW Where the hell did he come from ? MICHAEL NEVER MIND THAT . I 'LL GIVE YOU UNTIL THE COUNT OF THREE TO GET OUT ONE ! YANEK But who the hell are you ? ( A moment . Michael salutes , clicks his heels . ) MICHAEL I AM CAPTAIN DREYFUS  --  IN COMMAND OF THE VILNA REGIMENT AND I ORDER YOU TO LEAVE THESE PREMISES AT ONCE BRONISLAW Jesus ! MICHAEL TWO ! BRONISLAW A Yid Army ? p. 80 YANEK You hold him and I 'll kick his balls off . BRONISLAW Kick a Captain 's bails off ? YANEK Come on !

MENDL My dear Mr. Co-Star : I 'm a stupid man . I admit it . I say what the director tells me and that 's all . So either talk to me frankly like a friend so I can tell you drop dead . Or else talk to me like a so-called actor talking to another so-called actor and I 'll still tell you drop dead . But if you decide to talk to me a like a director  --  that 's different . Again , I 'll tell you drop dead but I 'll do what you tell me !

ARNOLD Read your letter from Morris and right away , I 'll read mine . ZINA They 're all right ? ARNOLD First read  --  ZINA ( She takes out Morris 's letter and reads : ) " Warsaw . May third , 1931 . Dear All : I 've thought so much about all of you and about what we meant to do together with Dreyfus . I think now that we were on the wrong track . A man today  --  no matter if he 's an artist or if he 's a proletarian  --  must not get too involved in the past . He must build a life for tomorrow . Here in Warsaw , I 'm now working in a big factory  --  no more in an exclusively Jewish community . I 'm a man among men . A worker among other workers . I 've been lucky enough to get to know several members of the Polish Workers ' Party  --  some are Jewish  --  but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ones who are not . We discuss many things  --  deeply and thoroughly , including you , my dear friends  --  and they have opened my eyes . To conquer anti-Semitism and all other forms of discrimination and oppression  --  we have to change the structure of society . When capitalism has been defeated , socialism will illuminate the world and free all men . That 's our aim . That 's our fight . Impossible you say ? But if it 's true that David conquered Goliath  --  what can resist thousands of Davids working together to make a better world ? As you can see  --  I 'm far from the theatre , but patience ; one thing at a time . At present , not one second of my life can be devoted to anything else . My friends , my brothers , my comrades  --  all our happiness depends on this  --  so does our freedom and dignity ; for us and for our children . So until we meet again  --  soon , I hope  --  in a different world , more just , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews and gentiles alike  --  all mixed together can live and work in peace . This is what I wanted to say  --  and to tell you that I love you all I ca n't give you my address . A militant has no address  --  but please know that we are united forever even though our roads do not cross again Goodbye , my comrades  --  do what you think you must . I believe in you and even if Arnold puts on Reb Tevye for the thousand and tenth time  --  even if it 's no good any more  --  do it as well as you can  --  the time for theatre will come back and it is best to be prepared Long live the revolution ! Long live the Polish Workers ' Party ! Long live the Soviet Union ( where anti-Semitism has been wiped out by law ) and long live  --  why not ?  --  the eternal Jewish people . Yours forever , Morris . " ( A silence. ) p. 88 MENDL ( Holding out his hand . ) Let me read it myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the letter . ) ZINA A lot I did n't understand also but  --  oi , did I cry . ( She blows her nose . ) Look ! Still . ARNOLD What 's to understand ? Nothing . He does n't want to have anything more to do with the theatre , that 's all . Finished ! For himself , believe me , he 's right . If the theatre 's not in your blood so it 's better to go and play with the revolution-shmevolution  --  not only better , but easier ! ZINA Come on . Now yours . ARNOLD I have n't got it with me . ZINA What ? ARNOLD But ! By heart I know it ! What do you think ? A letter from my daughter . It 's here . ( He taps his forehead . ) And here . ( He taps his heart . ) ZINA So let 's hear it from here ( She taps Arnold 's head. ) and here . ( She taps his heart . ) ARNOLD Generally speaking  --  everything is all right  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apartment near him in the Jewish quarter there in Berlin . They say there are plenty empty apartments there in the neighborhood . The only thing  --  so far  --  there is n't so much work around . But still , they 've got plenty of hope . They say also the Germans are very polite , very correct with the Jews . Of course , like everywhere , there are a few extremists  --  but  --  they think they 'll be able to talk to them . Not like our ignorant Polacks here . In Germany  --  everybody knows how to read and write , everybody 's educated . It 's a civilized country , no ? p. 89 ZINA And what else ? ARNOLD Nothing else . They 're happy . Everything 's fine . ZINA Are you 're sure they 're managing ? ARNOLD Well , you know Michael . Ability he 's got  --  but he needs somebody should give him every so often a little push , yes ? And Myriam  --  she pushes . Oh , yes . Also . They say  --  Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troupe so they can do theatre . You see ? They have n't lost faith . Because they 're artists . It 's in the blood . ZINA They asked about me ? ARNOLD What then ? Of course about you . And Mendl . And Zalman . And everybody . MENDL Well , as long as they can get along there , well and good . ARNOLD Believe me  --  they chose the right place . Michael started in talking about England . Can you imagine , England . But I told him , no . Definitely no . No island is a good country for us . MENDL Why not ? ARNOLD Because . What 's an island ? Surrounded by water . MENDL So ? ARNOLD How would you like to have to swim with a sewing machine ? ( They laugh . ) Anyway , in Germany  --  remember  --  they lost the last war  --  so they 're not going to start up again with anybody . They understand . p. 90 MENDL ( Getting up for his hat . ) Positively . ARNOLD So there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full costume , bulbous nose , beard and hat . ) I 'd like to see the letter  --  to touch it . ARNOLD What do you need the letter ? I told you the whole everything . They 're safe in Germany . They 're happy . And they hope we 'll all be together soon again . Forever . ZINA AND MENDL ( Together . ) Aw-main ! ! ARNOLD All right ? Ready ? How about getting on with something more serious , now ? ( Make-ups and get-ups complete , they take their places for the beginning of the sketch  --  all three . Mendl and Zina start from one side of the platform , Arnold from the other . They bump , almost fall . ) MENDL ( In his acting voice . ) " Aie ! Reb Tevye , just who I wanted I should bump into !

Mendl , Arnold and Zina go into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow , tomorrowWe wo n't have to borrowThe day after todayWill be better in every way !

Tomor  --  row . " ( They are performing a dance merrily . ) ALL THREE ( Singing . ) " Tomorrow , tomorrowAn end to our sorrowThe day after todayHooray ! Hooray ! Hooray !
