Park faces new protests <P> After a series of inflammatory antigovernment rallies , 3,000 university students tore through the streets of Pusan last week , attacking government offices with rocks and fire bombs and battling police far into the night . The Seoul government denied student claims that five demonstrators had been killed , but admitted that six , along with 73 policemen , had been injured . Six police cars and 21 sentry boxes were destroyed . The eight-hour rampage , which followed several other clashes the night before , was the most serious outbreak of rioting in South Korea since the student rebellion that overthrew President Syngman Rhee in 1960 . <P> The challenge was not lost on the tough , army-backed regime of President Park Chung Hee . After calling an emergency meeting of his Cabinet , Park clamped martial law on Pusan and replaced the local police chief with a general as military governor . The government also ordered a curfew , closed the campuses of both Pusan National University and Dong-a University , and imposed press censorship . Park appealed to the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation of constitutional rule . " <P> The rioting was only part of a broad surge of unrest against Park 's autocratic rule . Three days before the Pusan riots , all 69 opposition deputies in the 231-member National Assembly angrily resigned to protest the expulsion of their popular leader , New Democratic Party Chief Kim Young Sam . The assembly majority-carefully stacked with tame members appointed by Park-had voted to oust Kim after he attacked the government as " a basically dictatorial regime , " called on the U.S. to " pressure " Park on behalf of human rights and declared that he was prepared to discuss reunification with North Korean Dictator Kim II Sung . <P> Washington was displeased with Kim 's expulsion and even more concerned about the consequent turmoil , which could only damage the reliability of a Far Eastern ally that has 39,000 U.S. troops stationed on its soil . Even before the rioting , the State Department had criticized what it called " a definite retrogression of human rights in South Korea " and showed its disapproval by recalling Ambassador William Gleysteen for " consultations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown , accompanied by Gleysteen , went ahead with a long scheduled visit to Seoul . Even though he announced that the U.S. was withdrawing 1,500 of its support troops from the country , Brown reassured the South Koreans that the U.S. stood ready to come to their defense in case of a North Korean attack . American officials also said that Brown 's briefcase carried a private , more pointed message for Park : a rebuke from President Carter .
