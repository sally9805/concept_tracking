In a burst of enthusiasm for the salvation of the American environment , President Nixon urged Congress last year to enact a 14-point program of reforms . Members of Congress introduced a score of bills of their own to regulate everything from strip mining to the location of power plants . Yet not a single major piece of environmental legislation passed both houses . While everybody wanted a cleaner America , it appeared , not everybody was ready to pay for it , at least not when the economy was lagging . <P> Last week Nixon began his third environmental message by excusing Congress 's sorry record . He said that <P> 1971 was " quite properly a year of consideration , " but he went on to urge that <P> 1972 be " a year of action . " To that end , he proposed a total of 19 new measures and announced two executive orders , saying , " We must not slacken our pace but accelerate it . " <P> Sulfur Tax . The most controversial of Nixon 's proposals was to levy the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spew from electric power plants , smelters and refineries . The tax , starting in 1976 , would apply only to industries in areas that already have high air-pollution levels , but it would establish what Nixon called " the principle that the costs of pollution should be included in the price of the product . " <P> Sensible as the tax sounds , few people outside the Administration like it . Industrialists claim that there is no way to curb emissions of sulfur oxides at a reasonable cost . Conservation groups , on the other hand , argue that the proposed tax is too low to force industry to develop improved " scrubbers " to remove sulfur from chimney gases . By their reckoning , it costs 190 for present devices to remove a pound of sulfur from fumes , while the proposed tax is only 100 to 150 per pound . As a result , they fear that industry would pay the tax rather than clean the fumes , and that it would build new plants only in areas where the air is still clean . In any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumer . <P> Nixon 's program also includes : <P> - A ban on the use of poisons to kill predators-coyotes , wolves , eagles - on public lands . <P> Controls on the use of snowmobiles and other off-road vehicles on federal properties . <P> - Creation of 21 new parks , including the spectacular Pacific coastline around San Francisco . <P> - A limit to tax benefits like fast depreciation for any developers who build on wetlands judged to be " critical environmental areas . " <P> - Legislation to permit the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor the disposal of such toxic wastes as mercury , cadmium and arsenic on land or underground . <P> Environmentalists generally applauded the message . Indeed , their objections focused on Nixon 's omissions rather than his proposals . He neglected to attack overpopulation as a factor in pollution ; he did not announce an expected ban on clear-cutting of timber on public lands , and he failed to bar the Corps of Engineers from issuing permits to fill in wetlands , the nursery for most marine life .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
