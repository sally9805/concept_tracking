txt The state will have to pay contractors at least $85-million more to compensate them for losses caused by improper state planning of the South Mall project here , a high state official , conceded today . The extra payments , which may reach $150-million or more , are included in Governor liRockefeller 's deficiency budget , which is to be debated in both houses of the Legislature tomorrow . The deficiency budget bill has the money earmarked for " equitable adjustments " under a law passed in 1969 , but offers no details on the reasons . Adding $150-million would bring the cost of work on the 98.5-acre complex of cultural and state office facilities to nearly $850-million , according to Cortlandt . V. R. Schuyler , the retiring General Services Commissioner , who has been supervising the project . Mr. Schuyler conceded that the extra payments were being made to contractors to compensate them for delays they encountered in their work at the site . The state , he said , was largely responsible for the delays , which resulted in inflated labor and material costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind schedule and the payments were meant to keep the contractors from quitting the project and suing the state in the Court of Claims for damages because of the delays and their added costs . " The state was at fault ; there was more complexity to the project than we realized , " the Commissioner said . " People got in each other 's way , there actually was n't enough room for contractors and there was not enough labor to meet our requirements , " he said . The payments were disolosed by State Controller Arthur Levitt in response to queries . Mr. Levitt has repeatedly predicted that the Mall cost , which started'at an estimate of $250-million five years ago , will rise to $1-billion with an additional $500-million in interest charges . Mr. Levitt 's auditors have been monitoring the negotiations between the state and the contractors with the object , Mr. Levitt said , of " preventing a , windfall for contractors end ' subcontractors . " The Controller said in an in-I terview that the anticipated payments were " predicated on the state being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being " compensated for any damages they may have fered without going to the Court ' of Claims . " That court adjudicates all claims against the state . The potential magnitude of the " equitable adjustments " was pointed up by the fact that the Mall project involves 70 ( major contractors and hundreds of subcontractors . Less than a half dozen of these contracts have been adjusted upward but Commissioner Schuyler could not estimate how many more would have to be adjusted . " It would be impossible to estimate with accuracy , " he ' said . Doubling of Cost One major contract has already been changed , with the state paying $31-million more , or nearly twice the orginal contract proce , for the foundation of the main platform on which the Mall is being built . The original contract of $37 million has been adjusted to $68,415 , - 723 , with almost all the money already paid out . The largest single contract iri the state 's history , the $97-million contract for the platform itself to the Walsh-Corbetta combine , the only bidder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of General Services said that the Walsh - Corbetta contractors were seeking a total of $162-million ? nearly $65-million more than the original contract , Mr. Schuyler said that be thought the eventual adjustment would be in the range of $135-million to $140-million , at least $37-million more than the original contract . The concrete platform , which covers most of the Mall ' site immediately south of the Capitol , will provide the base for six of the 11 Mall buildings . Under the platform will be three underground levels for parking , shopping , a bus terminal and an expressway . Three Years Late Long a pet project of the Governor , the Mall was originally to have been completed this year . Now the target date is 1974 . Some Democratic critics have blamed the delays and confusion among contractors at the site on the Governor 's prodding ( for speedy construction . As a result , the critics assert , too many contracts were let si Imultaneously and contractors , ' found that they could not gain ' access to the site to fulfill their I contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their work . ? The 1969. law authorizing additional payments says , they may be made when the General Services Commissioner determines that " the performance of all or any part of the work has been suspended , delayed or interrupted for an extraordinary and unreasonable period of time by any act or omission of the state .
