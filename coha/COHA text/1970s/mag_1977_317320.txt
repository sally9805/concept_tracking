Warren Earl Burger was understandably miffed when the mail brought his invitation to Jimmy Carter 's Inauguration this week as the 39th President of the U.S. It asked a fee of $25 for a hard , wooden bleacher seat to watch the 2-hr . Inaugural parade . " If I have to pay $25 , " joked the Chief Justice of the U.S. , " I 'll charge Carter $50 to swear him in . " <P> Was the billing of Burger the epitome of egalitarianism , a felonious breach of etiquette or a simple gaffe ? Most probably a gaffe , and as such it typified the confusion of what may turn out to be the most chaotic Inaugural since Andy Jackson 's admirers tracked mud all over the White House in a frenzy to shake his hand . <P> A committee representing numerous ethnic groups was upset about the Inauguration Eve concert in Kennedy Center . The stars include Actors John Wayne and Paul Newman , Actresses Bette Davis and Shirley MacLaine , Comics Elaine May , Mike Nichols and Redd Foxx , Athletes Muhammad Ali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sills , Conductor Leonard Bernstein . Yet the Ethnic Cultural Inaugural Committee complained that the cast " does n't reflect the ethnic and racial diversity of America . " Most of the carping , however , centered on invitations and tickets . Some 300,000 " general invitations " on soft eggshell paper and colorful 16-page guides to the festivities were dispatched from computerized lists . They were meant mainly as souvenirs and included a warning in small type that they were good only for viewing the oath-taking and parade . Somehow one went to an inmate at a Texas state penitentiary , another went to a child who , having been elected president of her grade-school class , had written Carter on how to win the presidency . <P> The more valuable invitations went to 32,000 people and allowed each to buy two tickets at $25 apiece to attend one of the six inaugural parties . A more elite group of 19,500 could also reserve bleacher parade seats at $25 , and 11,400 could attend one of two receptions for Vice President Walter Mondale . Yet no one made sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose votes gave him the nomination at the Democratic National Convention , nor was there a specific mailing to the electors who formally put him in office . The Democratic National Committee was disgruntled at having only 500 tickets to distribute . John Fishwick , president of the Norfolk and Western Railway , had graciously agreed to serve as host for one of the six postInaugural parties . He was astonished when he failed to get an invitation to the swearing-in , parade or receptions . <P> The Inaugural planners , working out of an aging , two-story World War II building , professed confidence that the capital would not be overrun by huge crowds , although the six Inauguration Night parties would , as usual , offer little room for dancing . Nonetheless , major hotels are requiring four-day minimum stays at the standard $50 to $60 per day for two people . Those wanting limousines can get them for up to $250 a day but have to rent them for a minimum of five days . For the less affluent , there are free tourmobiles and shuttle buses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
