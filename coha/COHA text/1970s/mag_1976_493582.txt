Political Intelligence ( weekly , four pages , $36 , circula ? tion about 1200 ) bills itself as " an unbiased overview of the political scene . . . a sophisticated political newsletter written for a few thousand people who need to know the inside of political America . " Published by Gordon Weil , 1.972 campaign press secretary for George McGovern with the bi-weekly assistance of former TNR Contributing Editor Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The newsletter is written , printed and mailed from Weil 's home in Harpswell , Maine . He culls his information from books , newspapers and the Federal Register ; he runs up an " astronomical phone bill " plying old Washington contacts and trying to track down items not yet in the papers . Pat Caddell of Cambridge Survey sometimes provides Weil with material ( public attitudes about breaking up the oil companies , for example ) from polls commissioned by others . " Caddell 's material does not come from candidate 's private polls , " says Weil , " but I do n't know who pays for it . " During the campaign , PI ran a regular " Rules of the Game " feature , tracking rulings and advisory opinions of the Federal Elections Commission . The newsletter also provides longer analyses , special reports that may span two or three issues . In one of these ( April/May , 1975 ) Weil was perhaps the first to finger the evangelical movement as a potent force in presidential politics . But in reviewing candidates who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list . Newest among the newsletters ? now eight issues old ? is The Baron Report ( four pages , bi-weekly , $37.50 a year , 600 circulation ) . Baron is a journeyman political technician ? in 1972 he worked first in Harold Hughes ' presidential campaign , then for Edmund Muskie and finished up with George McGovern . In the years since , he has bees , a self-styled liberal activist and party reform advocate , a constant plotting presence just over Robert Strauss ' left shoulder . Before beginning his newsletter , Baron served as executive assistant to George McGovern , but was purged over Memorial Day weekend , just before the critical showdown primaries for what McGovern termed " anti-Carter activities . " ( Baron was quoted by New York Times writer R. W. Apple as comparing top Carter staffers Hamilton Jordon and Jody Powell to H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman . ) Baron was a political junkie at an early age ? he missed his own bar mitzvah to campaign for Adlai Stevenson . He was one of the leading inside dopesters in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written version of what he does all day anyway , " says one reader , " but now he 's charging for it . " The Baron Report is the only avowedly liberal newsletter in the bunch , and the only one that makes a special effort to report insider views of labor politics . But ideology takes a back seat to analysis and gossip , much of it provided by contributing editors Michael Barone ( co ? editor of The Almanac of American Politics ) , pollster Peter Hart and political consultant Mark Shields . Baron has not yet been able to give his newsletter a confident , forthright panache . He apparently can not decide whether to fashion a popularized , political gossip column or become the government-in-exile , leveling a tough , consistent , informed criticism at the new President . " I 'm skeptical but not anti- , " Baron says of Carter , adding , " I 'll try to develop inside sources . " Presumably , it is to that end that the rhetoric of The Baron Report has perceptibly softened as inauguration day approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively expensive , and you take what goes with it . What goes with it in most cases ? with the exception of Evans and Novak ? is a good deal of tracks-covering and bet hedging . At the end of his lengthy Carter-Hitler analogy , Kevin Phillips tacked : " Obviously the parallel is tenuous . " And , after offering a list of Carter 's most likely cabinet choices , The Baron Report added a classic hedge : " Do n't bet on any ? or even all ? of these names . " The general rule in all cases seems to be the one followed by Gordon Wei/ in his Political Intelligence : " You can take a flyer with a newsletter . The readers tend to remember when you 're right and forget when you 're wrong . " This account is derived from three weeks of hearing and watching some of the incoming Carter people and some of the outgoing Ford people instruct each other in the practice of government at the White House apex . The incumbents , mostly familiar only with the centralized Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past Presidents did some things in simpler ways with fewer assistants . The incomers are learning , and presumably telling their President-elect in what must be staggering stacks of memoranda , that much of the business of government at the White House level and below is not as simple as he thought or pretended to think it was during his campaign and after his election . A President-elect who promises to consolidate and simplify the federal establishment is represented in Washington by the biggest and most elaborate transi ? tion staff in history . Its 200-plus members are ensconced in the major agencies and departments , studying their organizations and methods and boning up on present and pending issues and problems for incoming Cabinet secretaries and directors . Despite the promises of orderly governance , a good deal of confusion attends the exercises . On a recent day , for instance , when Carter spokesmen were saying the press was mistaken in its notion that lists of candidates for 75 or so presidential appointments were to be published before Carter made his choices , so that the public and interested parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from whom Carter will choose his principal economic officials were announced . Carter conferred with them at his home in Plains the next day and was very much in the act in other ways . Stephen Hess , a former Nixon assistant and Brookings Institution Fellow whose new book , Organiz ? ing the Presidency , was favorably mentioned in this space , learned on Friday , November 19 , how personally and directly Carter is involved . Hess is a member of the US delegation to the current session of the UN General Assembly . He was in his office at the US delegation headquarters in New York when a secretary told him that a Governor Carter was on the telephone . " Governor Carter ? " Hess said . " What Governor Carter ? I do n't know any Governor Carter . " The secretary said it was the Governor Carter . According to Hess , Jimmy Carter convinced him that he had read the book and was not relying on a staff summary . Carter said he was much impressed , asked Hess to send him some memoranda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone number and mail address ? two items that at the moment are Washington 's topmost totem symbols . Greg Schneiders , Carter 's administrative assistant in Plains , telephoned again two days later and , after conveying Carter 's apology for not calling himself , shook Hess with requests for detailed memos on White House staffing and functions ranging from the office of the President 's military assistant to the First Lady 's office . President Ford 's staff chief , Richard Cheney , quietly passed the word that Hess was to be regarded and treated at the White House as one of Carter 's principal transition representatives . In his capacity as an advocate of a reduced and minimal.White House staff , Hess is a logical Carter choice . In two other respects , he is n't . He indicates in his book that he regards Carter 's pledge to make Vice President-elect Walter Mondale a key and important member of the administration a silly piece of standard ritual that all Presidents go through and never fulfill . Hess ' basic premise is that Presidents should n't try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he argues , they should recognize that " the primarypresidential role is to make choices ? choices that are ultimately political in nature . The President ( Hess ' emphasis ) is the nation 's chief political officer . " It 's a premise that sits oddly with a President-elect who puts the emphasis that Carter does upon what he calls " my commitment to a businesslike , tough , competent administration of the executive branch itself . " True enough , Carter proposes to hold his depart ? ment and agency heads , particularly his Cabinet secretaries , responsible for accomplishing that " business-like , tough , competent administration . " Whether Jimmy Carter or any other modern President can actually get by with doing that , and to all effects use and rely upon his Cabinet members as personal assistants and deputies to the extent that Carter intends , is a subject of fundamental difference between him and the chief incumbents , including the President , at the Ford White House . The proposition that it can be done is also fundamental to whether Jimmy Carter can install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct . The central question raised by the Carter proposition is whether a President 's interests and the interests of the heads of the major departments will always or even usually be identical or at least close enough to be compatible . The controlling assumption now is that they will be only if the President has at his command a staff large enough and capable enough to police the departments , identify and sort out the many interests and factions that exist within big departments and usually involve two or more departments , and finally summarize situations for the President in actionable and understandable fashion . The argument from incumbents that a President must have this capability at his own command and within his own staff is of course self-serving . But it 's worth attention when it comes from such a person as James Cannon , originally a journalist and Nelson Rockefeller assistant who directs the Domestic Council staff of some 25 " professionals " and 25 secretaries ( including 10 people who are detailed from other agencies and are on their payrolls ) . Cannon speaking : " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , not unique but different from other coordinating bodies at the White House ? is that we have one client , the President . However the next administration will want to structure its White House operation , it is imperative that there be some staff group in the White House that looks at all the myriad problems , ideas , opportunities that come to the White House ? and everything in domestic affairs comes here now . That staff must be able to assess all of these things and present them to the President in such a fair and balanced way that he always has all sides of any issue and all the facts he needs to base a judgment on . " Would it be practical for Carter to take some or all of this oversight and coordinating responsibility out of the White House proper and pass it to the Office of Management and Budget ? Cannon 's answer is typical of the one generally heard around the present White House : " Anything will work if the President wants it to work ? if he insists on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a strong responsibility to control the spending of money that it 's not in the best position to make a final presentation of a matter to the President . Its responsibility to keep spending down and income up is so dominant that there has to be somebody else , some other staff , to look at all the other aspects of programs and proposals that require money . " One of many related questions is whether any President nowadays can do without a chief of staff , regardless of whether he uses that name for the function . A Carter associate who thinks a President can is Matthew Coffey , one of the President-elect 's chief talent hunters . Coffey , who was Lyndon Johnson 's deputy personnel director , argued for a greatly reduced and simplified White House staff in a memorandum to Carter last June . He said the other day : " Running the place without a chief of staff is a terribly effective way to do it . It gives a President the opportunity to stand back , view things for himself , make up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President through a filter , and that filter by its very existence tends to control and screen the information that gets to the President . " Gerald Ford , a simple man with a natural preference for simple procedures , refused for a while to call Donald Rumsfeld a chief of staff and insisted on styling him a coordinator . Mr. Ford at length realized that he had to have somebody to track what his other assistants were doing and that Rumsfeld in fulfilling that function was in fact the President 's staff chief , as Cheney is now . President Carter may be expected to come around to it , too . I went one evening recently to the National Archives in Washington to hear a lecture by John Toland , the author of the much-publicized book , Adolf Hitler . When I find myself at such occasions , I look round curiously at the others who are there : since I am not sure why I have gone , I study their faces and dress to try to understand why they have come . One of the answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconcerting , even if not unexpected . Although I have glanced through it , read some of the reviews , and heard several people talk about it , I have not read Toland 's book . But it is not the book I am discussing . It is the evening at the National Archives , and what he said during it . After all , the subject of Adolf Hitler is of some importance ; and it is also important how the image of him in the popular mind is created , a generation after his death . According to his record , and by his own admission , Toland has had no training as a historian . I hoped to hear from his lecture why we should trust his picture of Hitler , and this indeed was what he chose to discuss . He was introduced by an unnamed representative of the Smithsonian : one of those earnest but worldly men and women who seem naturally bent to be theadministrators of the cultural institutions of the state . We were told that Toland is a " historian-reporter . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only because Toland can not be introduced as a historian . Whether he is a reporter is also open to question , but perhaps not so pressing a concern . We were then told that the historians proper might question ? as some already have ? the validity of Toland 's methods ; and we were told this , of course , with a dismissive sneer at the historians . What fuddy-duddies that they should care about the standards of their discipline ! What cur ? mudgeons that they should insist on the observance of certain rules in the sifting and weighing of evidence ! Was I really hearing this concession to vulgarity in the National Archives ? Toland rose , the stage left to him . He is engaging in a way : a member of the genteel classes who has fallen on good times . He said that he had thought that he would have to be intellectual in such a place , but on seeing our faces he had decided that this was not required , and he could be more familiar and anecdotal . I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience did not stir . He then said that he had not been trained as a historian , but had " sort of backed into history ; " and with that he began
