txt MILWAUKEE ? A federal Judge Friday blocked publication of a detailed technical article on the hydrogen bomb after hearing government arguments that the information would endanger the nation 's security . Judge Robert Warren imposed the today temporary restraining order despite pleas from the would-be publishers that any court action to stop the story would amount to prior restraint of the press and would be fought by attorneys as obstacles to free speech . " You ca n't speak freely when you 're dead , " Warren said in announcing the order . Warren spoke of the bomb as " horrendous " and speculated on the impact if the V-2 rocket had been perfected a little earlier in " my days " in Wirld War II . " I 'D WANT to think a long hard time before I 'd give the hydrogen bomb to Idi Amin , " he said at one point . The article had been planned for publication later this , month in the Progressive , a long-established magazine in Madison , Wis . The article , sold to the Progressive by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hydrogen Bomb Works . " Federal prosecutors say Department of Energy officials became aware of the article when the magazine 's editor , Edwin Knoll , and writer Iloward Morland sent copies to . Washington so that technical information could be checked for accuracy . Department of Energy experts wanted some changes , saying the article as it stands provides a blueprint for construction of a hydrogen bomb . When the magazine 's management would not agree , the suit followed . " THE ARTICLE concerns secrecy , " editor Knoll said after the court session . " It is not a how-to story on building a hydrogen bomb . " But that , was not the defense brought by the magazine 's attorneys during the hearing . They argued that the information gathered by Morland in writing the story was not secret but public domain . And they further argued that the U.S. Supreme Court 's ruling in favor of the New York Times after publication of the controversial , Pentagon Papers set a precedent against prior restraint of the press . " It would seem to me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a difference between spoiling the relations I have with another country as was argued with the Pentagon Papers and their ability to take me out of existence . " THE GOVERNMENT immediately challenged both arguments offered by the magazine 's lawyers . The Pentagon Papers decision , argued Thomas Martin , a special federal lawyer brought in from Washington , was made in favor of the newpaper because there was tie " specific standard " that forbade publication of the information in the papers . However , provisions of the Atomic Energy Act , they argued , specifically prohibit anyone from communicating reCon:Inued on page 4 , col .

The government attorneys also submitted several affidavits from government officials , each saying in one way or another that the information contained in the proposed article is secret and not known by the general public . Though government lawyers acknowledged that other major powers would glean little new information from the article , they argued forcefully that the technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons , perhaps even to individuals or small groups such as terrorists . THE MAGAZINE 'S lawyers countered with arguments that the information already is available . " The very fact that a man of limited education I Morland could come up with this without reading any secret documents , " lawyer Earl Munson argued , " indicates that the information already is available to the public . " Morland picked up the information during approved and authorized visits to federal research facilities and interviews with government experts , Munson said . " THE GOVERNMENT is n't even arguing that they ( other countries and individuals ) wo n't eventually get the information anyway , " Munson said . " Their only argument is when , how long it will take . " " Time is all we have , " said federal attorney Thomas Martin . " Time to make agreements , time to control it . " The arguments will continue next Friday , when the government will seek an injunction to prevent the article 's publication .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
