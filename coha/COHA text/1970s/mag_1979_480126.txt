DESPITE PRESIDENT CARTER 'S ten days of struggling at Camp David to find a solution to the nation 's energy shortages , he has moved further away from understanding the problem . Doubling his speed and losing sight of his goal , the President concluded that only massive intervention by the federal government could solve the problem , when in fact it is the energy and economic policies of the federal government that created it . For all his talk of having consulted a cross-section of American society during these deliberations , Mr. Carter did not meet with a producer of any kind . Not an oil producer . Not even a farmer . He met with Democratic politicians , labor leaders , environmentalists , preachers , favorite corporate managers , obsolete Keynesian economists , stars of the news media , selected bankers , and state and local bureaucrats . The only energy expert consulted was Thornton Bradshaw of Atlantic Richfield , popular in the White House for having endorsed the windfall-profits tax that his company no doubt imagines will finance the conversion of its own vast coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious chance the President could find the support in the country and in Congress to implement his program , there would be cause for alarm . Taxing $140 billion from the private sector ? to use the President 's figure ? to finance a synthetic-fuel , solar-energy program in the next decade would so decrease the efficiency of the stumbling American economy that the ensuing recession with inflation would guarantee Jimmy Carter 's departure from the White House . The President is the southern self-proclaimed populist who ran against the government in 1976 . How remarkable that he would wrestle with the energy issue for three years ? and for ten days at Camp David ? and decide to throw a colossal amount of federal money at the problem . Even as Carter was at Camp David , editorials and news columns in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal warned of the enormous costs of synthesizing oil from coal ? synfuel , as it is called . With great luck , the scheme may yield one million barrels a day by 1990 , these newspapers reported after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude-oil prices , without a windfall tax on domestic production , would yield an additional 2 million barrels per day by 1985 , according to testimony before the Senate Finance Committee by the Independent Petroleum Association of America . The projections , based on established coefficients between price , exploration , and finding rates , have not been challenged by the Department of Energy . This information has eluded the President . Worse , he seems to ignore the di . mcnsions of the problem , his own plan , and the international economics of energy . 0 IL IS FOUND in abundance only if a great many people are looking for it at once in all sorts of unlikely places , " Ruth Sheldon Knowles wrote twenty years ago in her history of the American OIL IN ABUNDANCE oil industry , The Greatest Gamblers . That insight is vital to understanding why there is an energy shortage in the world today . It is not just that insufficient numbers of people are looking for oil and gas in the United States ? although the policies of the federal government discourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for oil and gas all over the world , because most foreign governments discourage exploration in unlikely places . These policies , which could change tomorrow , in a year , or five years from now , prevent the private capital markets from financing the development of synthetic fuels , because an unanticipated change in foreign governments ' policies toward domestic oil exploration could wash away all private synfuel schemes with a flood of inexpensive , conventional oil and gas . Liquid petroleum that comes from a man-made hole in the ground under its own pressure constitutes only one percent of all the oil in the earth 's crust . The rest is " heavy , " the shales and tar sands that must be extracted at great expense . If you took all the liquid petroleum produced from all the wells drilled on earth since the first , at Titusville , Pennsylvania , in 1859 , and poured it into a lake the size of Chicago , roughly 227 square miles , the 330 billion barrels the earth has yielded so far would fill the lake to a depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that could be recovered at current prices and technology would fill the lake to a depth of 2,300 feet . Even this amount may seem worrisome , until we add in a number of important facts . In 120 years , about 3.2 million oil wells have been drilled into the planet 's crust . Of this number , 2.4 million were drilled in the forty-eight continental states of the United States , and most of these in the " oil patch , " as oilmen refer to the oil-producing southern states . The rest of the world has been relatively unexplored , especially former colonial nations of Africa and Asia . Of the 645,500 exploratory wells drilled on earth by the end of 1975 , 616,000 , or 95.4 percent , were drilled in the industrial countries . Africa , Latin America , South and Southeast Asia , and China have barely been touched . The United States accounts for 482,000 of the exploration wells , 74.7 percent of the total , and 34.9 percent of the oil in that imaginary Chicago lake of oil . The reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilled manpower , technol ogy , capital , and market , but that it has had policies conducive to exploration and a stable government that has protected the property rights of its private landowners . Landowners have possessed the mineral rights to oil discovered on their property . The indigenous exploration industry could develop here because individual explorers could lease the mineral rights from private landowners and drill , with the sure knowledge that the explorer and the landowner would possess any oil discovered , and that high risk might yield high reward . In addition , the U.S. government did not hoard land in the name of the collective interest , but sold the majority of western lands at 11.25 an acre to encourage settlement . Where this Jeffersonian pattern was not followed , there has been scant exploration . The U.S. government , for example , owns almost 90 percent of Nevada 's 110,000 square miles , and much of Nevada has not been explored . Alaska , too , has been relatively untouched by oil exploration , and increasingly the environmentalists , with the eager assistance of President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pub lands to any kind of mineral exploratio Even before the Carter Presidency , al . most 500 million acres of federal lands an area three times the size of Texas ' had been effectively closed to mineral exploration . President Carter has closed off another 185 million acres , and some of his people would like to close off more . The North Slope oil field in Alas ka , the largest field discovered in the United States ( the East Texas field being second ) , covers an area of only 400 square miles in a state of 566,000 square miles . 1 N MOST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES , even ernments , the conditions that lbs . in those with relatively stable gay . tered oil exploration in the United States are absent . Governments keep ti. tle either to most land or to the mineral rights of privately owned land . Income taxes are so confiscatory that should a native landowner possess mineral rights , he probably could not find native capital and labor willing to explore the land , as the government would capture the rewards through taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies to explore , but these companies will look only in places where oil is most likely to be found , where seismology can at least hint at probable finds . Most oil , however , can not be tracked by seismology , for , like the East Texas field . it is trapped in complex geology and will yield only to myriad explorers taking long shots . One half-joking rule of thumb among the international oil companies drilling in unstable countries is that you should try to pay all costs and make a small profit with the first tanker of oil that leaves the country , on the assumption that what oil remains will be nationalized or confiscated by taxation . Madagascar , off the southeast coast of Africa , for example , is almost the size of Texas , and lies in one of the world 's largest sedimentary basins where oil is most likely to be found . Prior to 1975 , the French controlled the island and there was almost no exploration , possibly because the French believed that if oil was discovered they would be pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil companies have been wary of one another , and as a result only eighty-three wells have been drilled on the island . Even in secure , developed parts of the world , the combination of high levels of government land ownership and steep personal taxation deters extensive exploration . Most of Australia 's 3 million square miles is held in collective ownership . In 1978 , a mere fifty-three exploratory wells were sunk , twice the number drilled in the previous year . In the Middle East , there is little exploration , the sheikhs having no desire to find and produce oil at a rate that would diminish the price they can command for their known reserves . Since 1974 , the Saudis have averaged a mere ten exploratory wells a year , Iraq only one a year , and the entire Middle East only ninety-five a year . Enormous amounts of conventional oil are waiting to be discovered , and will be once governments around the world ? including the United States ? are prepared to match the high risks of exploration with commensurate rewards . And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $200 billion from the domestic industry in the next decade , at the same time as he is shutting off more and more government lands to exploration , to finance synthetic-fuel projects 30 that can , at best , produce a dribble of oil while exacting severe costs from the landscape . This is to be done in the name of energy independence , to free us from OPEC 's alleged ability to set prices . Yet as Rep. David Stockman of Michigan has pointed out , even if by some miracle the government can produce 2.5 million barrels a day of synfuel by 1990 , it will still be unable to control the world price . The synfuel supply will go into the world 's base supplies of oil , and a country can influence the world price only if it can control the marginal supply . lf , in other words , the United States were willing to shut down the synfuel plants when the world oil price got too /ow and crank it up again when the price got too high , it could influence the world price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulating the output of the Texas oil fields . HE CASE AGAINST energy alternatives , including solar ener-gy , is not that they will not free the United States from OPEC 's pricing ; OPEC 's pricing is a function of U.S. monetary policy any-way . The reason is that the international and domestic potential for existing petro-leum and gas is so enormous that syn-thetic fuels will be uneconomical well into the next century . If , in the 1980s , the United States were to increase only slightly the rewards for domestic explo-ration , or if a feeble attempt were made by governments in the developing world to do likewise , the relative price of world oil would resume its historic decline . The United States would then either he forced to scrap the uneconomical syn-thetic-fuel program or drain , through taxation , the rest of the economy for an interminable period to keep it operating . In microcosm , the problem is the same as that of the proposed natural-gas pipeline from Alaska to the Midwest , which President Carter accuses the Alas-ka oil companies of dragging their feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cost $10 billion , and the gas delivered in Chicago would cost $3.50 per thousand cubic feet . The pipe-line can not be built because no investor can count on anyone 's buying $3.50 gas five or ten years from now . Should a President and Congress dedicated to in-creasing the supply of oil and gas be elected in 1980. and should government controls be lifted from production and pricing , natural gas would sell at much less than $3 , according to the Department of Energy 's own 1977 report , the so-called MOPPS study that the Carter Administration suppressed . Mr. Carter now proposes to pay $1.5 billion for the pipeline project , but even that will fail to make the gas **26;3391;TOOLONG Stockman has pointed out , through 1974 " 97 percent of the non ? North American natural-gas resource base had yet to be disturbed by a production-well bore . Nor was this potential resource negligible in dimension . The remaining natural-gas resource base outside of North America may total the equivalent of 1.4 trillion barrels , a quantity of energy equal to four times all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because the domestic price of natural gas has been kept low by government control for twenty-five years , almost all domestic exploration has aimed at finding crude oil , not gas . Freeing the price of natural gas would encourage more exploration in the continental United States , and this cleanest of fuels would be produced in such quantity that it would not only displace nuclear and coal as serious competitors , but also reduce demand for imported petroleum . The Alaska pipeline could be built only if the government promises to buy $3.50 ( or $4 or $5 ) gas that it would transmit , while there are plentiful supplies at $2.25 , and to pay the difference out of general revenues . The alternative would be to force customers in the Midwest to pay the tab through regulated utility rates ; however , midwestern commercial and farming interests would become uncompetitive with areas not so bound . B Y ALL ' RIGHTS , the Carter taxand-spending energy scheme ought to fail in Congress after it is debated this autumn . The President has no mandate to sustain it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressional elections were voters asked to consider and ratify such a grandiose government energy program . Indeed , in the 1976 campaign . President Carter was identified with government decontrol of energy and greater reliance on private business for solutions . President Ford , although he did not beat the drums for it , was still identified will ' Vice-President Rockefeller 's $100-billion program of synfuel subsidies . The 1978 Congressional elections provided sharp gains for free-market candidates over government interventionists , especially in the Senate . The Senate is where the President 's energy program should unravel . Reporters assessing the Carter energy speeches have pointed out that Congress was " already ahead of the President in legislating a mammoth synthetic-fuel program as well as the windfall-tax revenues to finance it . But beneath the surface , the whole idea of an emergency energy scheme had been doing poorly on the financial end . In late June , the segment of the oil industry that would be devastated by the proposed excise tax on domestic production ? the 10,000 independent producers who drill 90 percent of the exploratory wells ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the major oil companies were accepting the inevitability of the tax . In a surprising vote on June 28 , the House accepted a substitute amendment to the tax the President wanted , making it temporary instead of permanent and also reducing its effective bite . This 236 ? 1133 vote was a blow to White House strategists , who realized that the Senate Finance Committee and Chairman Russell Long would , in turn , take every opportunity to weaken the tax on domestic producers and produce a shadow of the bill the President wants . The Administration could see this inevitable path of defeat and knew that only something dramatic could give it a grip on the Senate . Camp David followed . The melodrama of the President 's Camp David retreat produced a moment of national enthusiasm for a synthetic-fuel program . The President did , after all , heighten public discussion about the energy issue to a level above that of clogged service stations . And , tempted to be bold , he placed the price tag of $140 billion on his program . The major oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either in peddling their billions of tons of coal to the government ? like Atlantic Richfield and Exxon ? or in getting government contracts to build synthetic-fuel plants , have naturally applauded the program . So has George Meant ' of the AFL-CIO , who envisions all that work for the building trades at cost-plus . The National Association of Manufacturers can be expected to make the same calculations , especially those member companies that believe they are in a good position to share the federal golden goose . But the $140-billion cost of the program concerns the electorate , which understands that people , not oil , pay taxes . The expectation of dozens of shale-conversion stations or coal-liquefaction 32 plants pouring fumes into the atmosphere has roused environmentalists . Sen. William Proxmire calls the synthetic-fuel scheme the " SST of the Eighties , " and can be counted on to lead the charge against it in the Senate . Mike Gravel of Alaska , a liberal Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee , is alarmed at the implications of the windfall tax on his state 's petroleum industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Connecticut Democrat and also a member of the Senate Finance Committee , has become more outspoken against the idea of taxing domestic production . The mood of the committee as it recessed for August was to exempt the taxation of newly discovered oil , wells that produce less than twenty barrels per day , and small producers ? up to perhaps 1,000 barrels per day . The tax may still be beaten altogether . T His POSSIBILITY does not , however , take into account the determination and resourcefulness of the forces behind this mammoth tax and spending scheme . It will be hard for the Senate to resist . Democrats and Republicans , who have been held down by tightening budgets for several years , regard the excise tax revenues as a government windfall . Bruce Bartlett , a Senate staff member , writing in the August 6 and 20 issue of Inquiry , suggests where the money might go : Senator Henry Jackson has come up with his own energy bill that would , among other things . authorize $5 billion to build fifteen synfuel plants . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson made a point of specifying the following , projects : ? $500 million for the Solvent Refined Coal 1 project in Kentucky ( supported by Senators Wendell Ford and Walter Huddleston ) ; ? $700 million for the SRC II project in West Virginia ( supported by Senator Robert Byrd ) ; ? More than $1 billion for high- and low-BTU coal gasification projects in Ohio and Louisiana ( supported by Senators Howard Metzenbaum and Bennett Johnston ) ; ? Geothermal plants now tentatively set for Idaho . California , and New Mexico locations ( supported by Senators Frank Church , Alan Cranston , and Pete Domenici ) ; ? $300 million in loan guarantees for an urban and industrial waste conversion plant ( supported by Senator Bill Bradley of Ne4 ' Jersey ) : and ? $250 million for a fuel-cell dem . onstration program pushed by United Technologies Corporation of Connecticut ( supported by Senator Lowell Weicker ) Business and labor see only the first-order individual gains of such largesse . They can not see the colossal drain on the economy as a whole , which will drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included . The parallels with 1929 are eerie . Fifty years ago exactly an engineer was in the White House as the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act was under consideration in Congress . The same autarchic forces that were behind the industrial independence of Fortress America are now behind the Carter plan of energy independence . Business and labor backed Hawley-Smoot , which would shut out foreign imports with a massive tax . Now the President would hold crude imports to 1977 levels with a quota ? which surely has the effect of discouraging the rest of the world from looking for oil to send to this biggest market ? and he would impose the tax internally . Again , business and labor eye the pork barrel . As Congressman Stockman put it , in his important essay in the fail , 1978 , Public Interest : The decision to eschew an economic policy of trading on the world market for the 90 percent of the non-U , S. oil and gas resource base that remains to be deed . oped in favor of a cramped , inward-looking policy of autarchy may prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the twentieth century ? if it is not soon reversed . At that point in the summer of 1929 , it still seemed as if the internationalists might win . A majority coalition in the Senate still opposed the tariff . October , 1929 , when the Senate coalition crumbled is when it became clear that the internationalists had lost . Should the present engineer win a similar victory fur au ? tarchy in 1979 , the difference would be in a less palpably dramatic stock market crash . In 1929 , the dollar still had a monetary standard ? it was tied to gold ? so all declines of value were real , there being no inflation . Now , inflation masks the decline in stock values . In the past eighteen months , relative to gold , the value of dollar-denominated financial assets has plummeted by 50 percent . With inflation , crashes take place quietly , but with a decrease in the nation 's economic vitality that is as severe as the drain of the Depression .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
