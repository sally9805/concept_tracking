WASHINGTON was relieved . The embarrassing one-sided presidential election in South Viet Nam was finally over . Whatever the condition of democracy in that battered land , President Nguyen Van Thieu , the man whom the U.S. considers the best bet for stability , seemed firmly in charge . The Nixon Administration was only too eager to turn its attention from Saigon 's problems to other more portentous matters : post-freeze economic plans and the return of National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger to Peking late this month to make final arrangements for Richard Nixon 's visit to that long-forbidden city . <P> " Do n't Tell Me . " Indeed , the Administration has fallen into the habit of talking as though the war in Viet Nam were already over . Nixon is fond of repeating , almost casually , the claim that " we are ending the longest war in the history of the U.S. " Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird not long ago startled top aides at the outset of his weekly military briefing by ordering : " Do n't tell me about Viet Nam now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end . " Viet Nam always used to be first on his agenda . Now U.S. officials seem confident that the South Vietnamese military forces can withstand Communist pressure as U.S. troop levels decline . They even speak wistfully of how military victory might have been within reach . <P> Unfortunately , Thieu 's hig-handed re-election tactics botched the Administration 's plan for a graceful exit from Viet Nam . Nixon had hoped to be able to point to the election as evidence that democracy is taking hold in South Viet Nam . Now , almost no one in Washington believes Saigon 's figures on either the high voter turnout ( 87.7% ) or Thieu 's vote of confidence ( 94.3% ) . Nixon merely noted that " the road toward democracy and contested elections is a long and hard one . " Almost apologetically , he argued that Thieu 's unchallenged victory was no reason to cut off U.S. aid , since two-thirds of the 91 nations now getting U.S. funds also show little taste for political competition . <P> Sigh of Relief . However disappointed he is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change course . In November he is expected to announce a stepped-up withdrawal rate that will bring the U.S. involvement down from 213,900 troops now present to a residual force of about 40,000 by next spring . The men who remain will be mostly logistical troops and Air Force personnel . At that level , Administration leaders contend , the war will no longer be a big issue in U.S. politics . " No one will get worked up about it any more , " argues one State Department official . " Everyone will just sigh with relief that we got out . " The Administration 's confidence that the war is no longer much of a problem politically has been reinforced by the waning influence of congressional doves .
