 | Within a matter of months , two U.S. doctors will attempt the most dramatic transplant ever ? the transfer of an embryo from one woman 's body to another 's . Here 's how it will be done and what it will mean to us all Some time in the very near future an event of enormous significance will take place . A human embryo , fertilized and nurtured in the - womb of one woman , will be transplanted into the womb of another -- where nine months later it will come to term . And another incredible feat is also almost at hand : an egg , taken from the ovary of a woman with hopelessly blocked Fallopian tubes , will be fertilized in a test tube with her husband 's sperm , nurtured there to the embryo stage , and implanted back into her womb ? where it , too , will come to term . In fact , one researcher , Dr. Douglas Bevis of Leeds University , England , already claims to have tried this procedure ? and with success . Last year he reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three normal children were born . Or so Dr. Bevis says . Most  | experts are justifiably skeptical of his unsupported claims , and of the fact that his announcement was made to the lay press and not , as is customary , in a fully documented article published in a professional journal . But what experts are not skeptical about is the imminence of a dramatic breakthrough in the field of reproductive science . Not long ago Dr. Bentley Glass , former president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , predicted that by the end of the century , a fully formed baby , conceived and grown in an artificial womb , will be " decanted . " ( The word born does n't seem to apply . ) To some observers all this comes uncomfortably close to the Brave New World Aldous Huxley envisioned almost 50 years ago ? babies conceived and perhaps altered in a test tube , and grown to specification on a laboratory assembly line . But to others ? particularly men like Doctors Landrum Shettles and Wayne Decker in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transplants ? these advances in reproductive science signal a brave new era in helping women overcome fertility problems . An implant allows a couple to bypass blocked or damaged Fallopian tubes , and become natural , biological parents in spite of them . But because no one ? except perhaps Dr. Bevis ? knows for sure how to mimic in vitro the environment where fertilization naturally takes . place , implants may be more hazardous and less sure to result in pregnancy than the simpler transplants . With transplants , because the egg is fertilized naturally in the body of the donor , some of the uncertainties ? for instance , the possibility of genetic damage ? that experts fear can be bypassed . Also , transplants promise there will be a better chance of achieving pregnancy every time . ( The drawback is , of course , that the woman who seeks a transplant can not use her own egg , although her husband can fertilize the egg she does use via artificial insemination . ) So far , Doctors Shettles and Decker report no lack of women eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a dream fulfilled , to others a nightmare . Whatever your point of view , the following scenario shows what it might be like . The time : Early 1976 . The place : A major New York City hospital . Beth is a high school teacher , 26 , blonde , blue-eyed , pretty , petite , Catholic . It was only after considerable soul-searching that she and her husband decided that , as Beth puts it , " the world being the way it is today , two children are all anybody should have . " And since they already are the parents of two bright , healthy children . Beth is in the hospital for a tubal ligation ? the Fallopian tube-tying operation that will prevent her from bearing children again . However , at this moment , she is also four-days pregnant ? and not by chance . She knows she is pregnant and so do her doctors .  | Amanda is in the same hospital , but even though her case is intimately and uniquely related to Beth 's , the two women do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 ; the resemblance is not striking , but she does have many of Beth 's characteristics : she is blonde , blue-eyed and of small frame . She is also Catholic . However , in one critical respect she is quite different from Beth : after ten years of marriage she is still childless and , owing to what her doctors have told her are permanently blocked tubes , she has not , until this moment , believed she could have a child of her own . Now she is in the hospital for a simple but historic operation ? an embryo , only a few days old , will be taken from the womb of another woman and transplanted into her uterus . Thus , despite those nonfunctional tubes , she will at last become pregnant and carry a baby to term . On the eve of the operation , in the privacy of her hospital room , Amanda and her husband review the situation . They know that somewhere in the same hospital is the woman , registered under an assumed name , from whom doctors will obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donor . " ( Beth , meanwhile , knows Amanda only as " the recipient , " and she , too , is registered in the hospital under a secret " code " name . Both were devised by doctors to prevent the two women from ever discovering one another 's identity . ) Amanda has been told that the donor found for her " matches " her in terms of physical , genetic and even religious background . Amanda also knows that her doctors , through the use of hormonal drugs , have synchronized her menstrual cycle with that of the donor . The drugs have " tricked " her system into " believing " that a fertilized egg is even now making its leisurely way down her Fallopian tubes , and as a result , the lining of her uterus is " ripening , " preparing to receive and nourish it . Of course , Amanda 's body is pretending . There is no fertilized egg in her blocked tubes . But there is one in Beth 's . Doctors have detected its presence with an electronic analyzer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components in blood and urine samples . Now Beth and her husband , waiting in a room in another wing of the hospital , reflect on what has happened and what is soon to happen . Beth recalls being a little surprised ? then actually pleased ? by her doctor 's suggestion that she consider donating an egg in order to help another woman become pregnant . The egg could be obtained during the tubal ligation she had requested , so there would be no need for additional surgery or risk . When the doctor went on to explain that they wanted a fertilized egg , Beth naturally assumed that her own husband would fertilize it . But the plan , as the doctor outlined it , called for artificial insemination ? using sperm from the recipient 's husband . Beth knew that artificial insemination is now commonplace , and that tens of thousands of healthy babies have been born as a result of it . She had no objections and neither did her husband . He and Beth had signed the necessary legal " release " form during a visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they understood what would be involved in the procedure , and that they would relinquish for all time to the recipient and her husband the baby that would be born . ( Amanda signed similar forms . She acknowledged , among other things , that the procedure might not work , and that , even as in normal pregnancy , there is some chance that the baby might be deformed or retarded . ) Studies well in advance of the actual procedure were then performed to determine the precise time of Beth 's ovulation , and Aman. - da 's cycle was made to coincide with it . Two days before ovulation , on the day of ovulation and on the day following ovulation , Beth was artifically inseminated with sperm from Amanda 's husband . When conception was confirmed , Beth and Amanda both entered the hospital and plans proceeded for the actual transplant . On the morning of the operation , Beth is taken to sur - gery under general anesthesia . A laparotomy ( abdominal incision ) reveals her reproductive organs . The tubes are cut near their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a carefully prepared antiseptic solution that washes through and pours out into a container , placed at the open ends near the ovaries . Then the attending physicians locate the 32- to 64-cell embryo in the solution ; it is already visible to the naked eye . Without removing it from the liquid , they examine it closely under a dissecting microscope and draw it into a syringe , along with some of the fluid . While one of the doctors completes Beth 's operation , another takes the syringe and its nearly microscopic passenger to an adjoining suite where Amanda , fully conscious , waits . A soft catheter has been inserted through the vagina and cervix into the upper reaches of her womb . The embryo and its nutrient solution are injected through this catheter into the womb . After two or three days of " roaming free , " as one doctor put it , the embryo will , if all goes well , attach itself to the progesterone-enriched lining of the uterus . Then the recipient 's own pregnancy-support systems will go into action , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors think it 's warranted , amniocentesis may be performed to assess the health of the unborn . This involves inserting a hypodermic needle through the abdominal and uterine walls to draw off some of the fluid in which the developing fetus is suspended . A microscopic examination of fetal cells contained in the fluid can reveal many , though not all , possible genetic and metabolic defects . If anything is found seriously amiss , a therapeutic abortion will be performed . However , Amanda 's doctors are confident that the outcome will be a happy one , and that their efforts will be rewarded with a healthy baby ? the first of a truly new generation . Although doctors in New York City now have the medical technology they need to perform transplants like the one described , so far they have held back to wait for " guidelines " from the National Institutes of Health that they expect will be forthcoming within the next several months . At this writing . NIH , a government , tax-supported agency is now listening to individuals and groups on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implants are humane and moral , and those who believe it is wrong to " manipulate " life in this way . In New York , doctors believe NIH will " give its blessing " to the operations , at least under some circumstances , and they hope to begin in just a few months . Those who doubt that embryo transplants can be successfully carried out are likely to be astonished by the things that have been accomplished in animal reproduction in recent years . Prize cows , for example , are now being given drugs that cause them to " superovulate , " each releasing up to 30 mature eggs at one time . The animals are then artificially inseminated with the sperm of prize bulls , and the resulting embryos are flushed from their tubes ; next they are transplanted into the wombs of ordinary cows or " mother surrogates , " as they are called , which carry the " supercalves " to term . In this way one prize cow is easily able to produce hundreds of superior offspring ? without ever going through the rigors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezing animal embryos , without damage , until they are ready to use them . Thus whole " herds " of sheep and cattle ? in embryo form ? can now be shipped around the world in small , refrigerated packages . Once thawed , they are implanted in mother surrogates and brought to term . Hundreds of women have already petitioned the several doctors in Britain , Australia and the United States who are preparing for embryo implants and transplants , and many tens of thousands more are expected to demand them when their existence becomes widely known . Both " Beth " and " Amanda " are real people , though the operation described has not yet taken place . Beth has expressed full willingness to contribute a fertilized egg to another woman when she has her tubal ligation , some time in the near future . " From a purely religious point of view , " she says , " it would make me feel better if I could help another woman get pregnant while I 'm making sure that I wo n't get pregnant again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many more " Beths " equally willing , either for a fee or , as in Beth 's case , for nothing at all , to help their less fortunate sisters . When it comes to the " Amandas , " one of the doctors says : " Let 's just say that we do not lack in that category . At first we thought women would not want transplants unless they could use their own eggs . We were wrong . " The American physicians most likely to perform these first operations are Dr. Wayne Decker and Dr. Landrum B. Shettles of New York City . Dr. Decker is surgeon-in-chief at the New York Fertility Research Foundation , a nonprofit organization which specializes ? and very successfully , it should be noted ? in cases of infertility that other doctors have abandoned as " hopeless . " Dr. Shettles is an internationally known researcher who has done much of the fundamental work in the field of human reproduction . He was the first to thoroughly document in vitro ( test tube ) fertilization of the human egg , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human conception . Through Doctors Shettles and Decker , I was introduced to a number of couples who hope to become candidates for baby transplants . Their cases show how diverse people and their reasons are for wanting this operation : Dianne Harlan , 34 , of Midland , Mich. , worked on Wall Street and as a professional model in New York City for several years . Now , she says , she would love to be a mother , but her doctors tell her they can not reopen the tubes she had tied as a birth control measure some years ago . She and her husband , a financial officer for a large corporation , have decided to adopt a Korean or Vietnamese infant . At the same time , however , Dianne would welcome the opportunity to bear a child herself and has notified doctors in England , Australia and New York to tell them of her eagerness to have an embryo implant or transplant . Like Dianne , her husband , John , says he has " no hang-ups " about the idea of his wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing immoral or unnatural about it , " he says . " People who do n't understand the first thing about this , " Dianne adds , " jump to the conclusion that doctors are growing monsters in test tubes . That 's all nonsense . Even my most conservative , religious friends are able to accept it when I explain exactly what 's involved . My mother thinks the idea is great . And I think the woman willing to take the extra effort to go through this procedure is obviously giving a lot more thought to having a child than most people do . Babies born as a result of transplants or implants are bound to be more wanted and appreciated than those born in the normal fashion . " Those people who say all this is immoral just are n't thinking . Most people these days put more time and thought into planning a vacation than they do for a child . That 's what I call immoral . " Another woman , the 30-year-old wife of a cardiologist , said her tubes were removed after they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says she would gladly accept a donor egg . " I get very angry at people who make pious pronouncements about taking the Lord 's work in our hands ' and so on , " her husband declares . " Every time you give someone medicine or perform surgery it can just as easily be said that you 're interfering with nature or taking the Lord 's work into your hands ! "  | Mrs. Karen Goldman is a 31-year-old Upper Montclair , N.J. , housewife , and former business-communications instructor . After her tubes were ruptured by tubal pregnancies , she began to consider an embryo transplant when she became " fed up " with what she calls the " appalling adoption situation . " She found that it would cost " between $8,500 and $25,000 " to obtain a healthy infant of her own race ( Caucasian ) through private placement sources . " The public agencies simply do not get these children any more . And when one does turn up , there are hundreds of prospective parents on the waiting list . By and large you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is convinced that attorneys are making unfair profits from human lives and , in some cases , " bending the law . " Another woman who became interested in embryo transplants after a frustrating effort to adopt is Mrs. V. of the Bronx , N.Y . " Because of widespread use of birth control and especially abortion , " she observes , " adoptions are very difficult to arrange now . But on top of that , you have profiteering attorneys who act as the middlemen and make the situation even worse . It 's all a matter of how much money you have , not how well qualified you are to be parents . For $4,000 , lawyers said they could get me a malnourished infant from Colombia , South America . However , they said it would cost $15,000 for a healthy white baby . I do n't make that kind of money . " Mrs. V. has normal tubes but does not ovulate unless she is given fertility drugs . To further complicate matters , her husband is sterile . Yet she and her doctors believe she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by another couple , and then transplanted to her womb . Most of the women I spoke to said they would prefer to have a child from 1 an egg of their own but would be happy to accept a donor egg if the implant procedure were not available or considered safe . Only one woman , Mrs. Edith Deuel of Rochester , N.Y. , said she would not accept another woman 's egg but would " give my eye teeth if they could fertilize one of my own eggs in a test tube , and then reimplant it in my body . " Both of Mrs. Deuel 's tubes were destroyed by tubal pregnancies . One woman , Mrs. V. , said she would actually prefer to be given another woman 's egg . " I 'm a coward , " , she explains . " If they give me another woman 's egg they wo n't have to operate to get one of my own ! " These cases , which show what kind of person may be treated initially , by no means exhaust the possibilities . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's egg implanted in her womb . Or a woman with healthy tubes and ovaries but with a medical condition that makes it dangerous for her to go through pregnancy might persuade another woman to carry her baby for her . Dr. Shettles says he has already heard from several women in this latter category . Finally , a busy career woman , though entirely capable of conceiving and carrying a baby to term , might opt to hire a " mother surrogate " to do the job , taking the baby back at birth . The doctors say they probably would refuse to carry out that sort of procedure , which brings into play what they call " wombs for rent . " Dr. Decker has submitted a " protocol " or detailed proposal to a major New York hospital requesting permission to begin performing embryo transplants for women with tubal problems . He is " guardedly optimistic " that the protocol will be accepted , observing that much hinges on " the attitude the NIH takes in the next few months , when it finally formulates its policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performs up to 70 inseminations a week , sometimes utilizing frozen sperm ) , Dr. Shettles recalls the controversy that initially slowed progress in that field . " It 's the same thing now with the eggs . There are various legal issues to be worked out . " The fear that the egg donor might try later to claim the baby , he believes , is probably unfounded . Hundreds of thousands of artificialinsemination cases have resulted in only a handful of lawsuits . As for the fear of possible damage to the eggs and sperm from human manipulation , Dr. Shettles points to a study of 20,000 births that resulted from artificial insemination . The study revealed the number of abnormalities in this very large sample to be no greater than that in a like number of " natural " births . And the data on animal work to date , Dr. Decker says , indicates that the egg , just like the sperm , can be removed , implanted , transplanted , even frozen and stored without danger . " If damage does occur , " Dr. Shettles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defective embryo through spontaneous abortion . This happens in natural pregnancy all the time . " The couples I talked to , though very positive in their desire to become candidates for these operations , did have some questions . One man wanted to know whether he and his wife would be able to " help choose " the egg donor . Patient participation in donor selection , the doctors say , is definitely out of the question for legal reasons , though every effort will be made to find a satisfactory match before a transplant is even considered . One woman wanted to know if a transplant operation , which some have termed " prenatal adoption , " would require going through all the red tape involved in normal adoption . It 's conceivable , the doctors say , that the courts might eventually rule that these operations constitute adoption , and that adoption papers must therefore be filed . But , they point out , this has not been true in the case of artificial insemination and most likely will not apply here , either . What guarantee would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said she would consent to an implant only ) , that the doctors would not substitute another woman 's egg for her own after it had been removed , or would not fertilize the egg with the sperm of a man other than the woman 's husband ? There would be no reason to resort to such subterfuge , the doctors reply , since there are so many women willing to accept another woman 's egg and , in some cases , the sperm of men other than their husbands . Other women asked about the costs and complications of these procedures , wondering , for example , if they would have to be hospitalized for long periods . Since individual cases vary a great deal no set costs can be cited , though it is safe to say that since the procedures are relatively simple , they would not be great . The recipient may spend no more than a night or two in the hospital , and then only as a precaution , especially in the case of implants , which could be safely performed in a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some cases , be shared by the recipient . " But even then , " one of the doctors said . " the costs would n't remotely compare to those involved in adoption . " Two women , one of them Catholic , asked whether any of the babies that are now being voluntarily aborted could be " salvaged " for transplantation to women who want children . " If this could be done , " one of the women said , " those who have protested , on moral grounds , against abortions would be hard-pressed to continue their criticism . " Actually , this intriguing idea had already occurred to Doctors Decker and Shettles . Noting that nearly one million U.S. women had voluntary abortions in 1974 alone , the doctors believe there is a potential opportunity here for women eager to have embryo transplants . Increasingly , Dr. Decker observes , women who merely suspect they might be a few days pregnant are having " menstrual extractions " as a precaution . The lining of the womb , and often a tiny embryo , are extracted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the cervix . Dr. Shettles says that he has examined a number of these extracted embryos and believes the menstrual extraction often does them no damage . Further study may show that they are suitable for transplants . " If this turns out to be true , " Dr. Decker says , " and if , in addition , we are eventually able to freeze human embryos , there will never be any shortage of babies for prenatal adoption . " He adds that he will " almost certainly " begin experimentation to determine whether human eggs can be frozen and stored , and Dr. Shettles plans to see whether frozen eggs , once thawed out , can still be fertilized and undergo normal cell division .
