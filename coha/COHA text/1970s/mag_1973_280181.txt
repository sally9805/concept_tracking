Ever since the Watergate scandal broke wide open , it had seemed probable that Nixon 's former closest aides , John D. <P> Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman , knew as many of the secrets of the sordid affair as anyone else . Last week both men stepped forward for the first time to define their own roles in a small but crucial aspect of the case . Testifying before a Senate appropriations subcommittee on their dealings with the CIA , Haldeman and Ehrlichman proved short on memory but very long on devotion to national security as a justification for their actions-clearly taking their cue from the President 's own curious and unsettling manifesto of the week before . <P> Ehrlichman had been accused in previous Senate testimony of ordering CIA assistance for E. Howard Hunt Jr. , a White House " plumber " who , after receiving such aid , helped engineer the burglary of Daniel Ellsberg 's psychiatrist 's office . Both Ehrlichman and Haldeman had also been accused by former CIA officials of obstructing the FBI 's investigation of Watergate . Specifically , they were said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with FBI Acting Director L. Patrick Gray III and tell him to go easy in his investigation on the ground that his agency 's probe might expose CIA operations . <P> In a courtly , low-keyed soliloquy , Ehrlichman tried his best to brush away both accusations . He claimed he had no idea who had requested CIA assistance for Hunt , but said he was sure it had not been himself . Or rather , he was almost sure . " The best I can say to help the committee , " said Ehrlichman , " is that I do not recall doing so , and the particular circumstances of the matter do not argue that I did . " Even in making that defense , he seemed to be preparing a fall-back position in case his memory was later refreshed . Hypothetically entertaining the notion that he might have called the CIA on Hunt 's behalf but forgotten about it . Ehrlichman said , " It must have been the first and only time I did so without presidential direction , and apparently at the request of someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Clemente to ask me to do so . " <P> The following day , Marine Corps Commandant General Robert E. Cushman Jr. , the former deputy director of the CIA and the man who had implicated Ehrlichman originally , reaffirmed his recollection that Ehrlichman had instructed him to help Hunt . Daily CIA staff notes proving his contention , Cushman said , had been turned over to the " necessary congressional committees . " <P> Both Ehrlichman and Haldeman responded to the second allegation being investigated by the subcommittee - the attempt to use the CIA in the Watergate cover-up - by insisting that that had not been their intention . They readily admitted that they did instruct CIA Deputy Director Vernon Walters to warn Gray that his agency 's Watergate investigation might blow the cover of CIA operatives . But they claimed they did so at the specific request of President Nixon , and for legitimate reasons . Picking up the President 's national-security theme , Ehrlichman said that " such questions had to be asked and answered , in the national interest . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
