For the past three years , Washington 's policy toward U.S. grain sales to the Soviet Union has been flawed in one important way . The only real policy has been to let the Soviet government play the free U.S. market by negotiating with private grain exporters : the Soviets had no obligation to say how much they wanted to buy , and Washington , though informed of the deals , might or might not choose to impose any limits . Soviet demands have bounded erratically from as little as 1.8 million metric tons last year to 10.2 million tons so far this year . The Soviets would like to buy still another 11 million metric tons because of poor harvests in Russian wheatfields . The resulting shock waves have been felt throughout the U.S. economy and have contributed materially and psychologically to inflation in the supermarket . <P> Last week in efforts to smooth out the roller coaster and placate critics . President Ford moved to regulate future U.S.-Russian grain deals . He dispatched a high-level negotiating team to Moscow to try to work out stable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Robinson , Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs . To allow time for the negotiations , Ford also extended for a month , until Oct. 15 , the moratorium imposed last month on additional grain sales by Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz . <P> Minimum Level . The moves are largely political and are aimed most immediately at mollifying big labor . AFL-CIO President George Meany had denounced the grain purchases as part of maintaining a " phony " dtente with the Russians . Responding to Ford 's announcement , longshoremen called off their boycott of Russian-bound wheat ; they had refused to load it , then complied with injunctions ordering them back to work . Ford also gave assurance that negotiations over shipping rates paid by the Russians would go on , to ensure that at least one-third of the grain would be carried in U.S. vessels-a key concern of the longshoremen . The President 's actions also allow shipment of the grain that the Soviets have already contracted for , appeasing farmers and grain dealers who anticipate large profits from the exports . <P> What precise form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be similar to the one concluded a few weeks ago with Japan , under which that country committed itself to a certain minimum level of grain purchases-11 million tons annually - over a three-year period . If the Japanese do not need the grain , they will put it into storage to assist in rebuilding seriously depleted world reserves . <P> If a U.S.-Soviet grain agreement does follow that pattern , its effect in holding down price increases would at best be long-run and indirect . Assurance of a continuing Soviet market might encourage U.S. farmers to plant more crops . Also , building up of a Soviet grain reserve might discourage sudden and inflationary purchases when Russian crops fail . But nothing in the Japanese agreement prohibits additional purchases beyond the agreed minimum , and it is likely that a Soviet agreement would not do so either . Whatever the terms of a U.S.-Soviet arrangement , they are expected to be worked out quickly ; talks among lower-level officials have been going on in Moscow for a month .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
