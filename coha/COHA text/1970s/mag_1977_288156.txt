Evangelist Billy Graham brings the word to Budapest <P> At dawn the worshipers began gathering in a sunbathed clearing in the wooded hills north of Budapest , overlooking the Danube . In this Sermon on the Mount setting , wizened farmers in stiff Sunday black mingled with villagers wearing gaily embroidered costumes and city youths in Western jeans and printed T shirts . The crowd had reached 10,000 when the Rev. Billy Graham , visibly moved at the reception , made his way to the rostrum last week to begin his first Soviet-bloc preaching tour in three decades of gospel globetrotting . <P> Following introductions and a Southern gospel solo by Singer Archie Dennis that bemused the congregation , Graham began by explaining , a sentence at a time to permit translation into Hungarian , that he had come to Hungary at least partly to check whether the Danube was blue and get a taste of native gulys . He recalled his own days as a boy down on the farm where he milked 20 cows every morning and coped with lost sheep and a smelly goat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3:16 , " For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son " ( in Hungarian : " Ugy szerette , Isten a vilgot , hogy egy szltt Fit adta oda " ) . When Graham concluded by asking the Hungarians to signal their rededication to Jesus Christ , thousands of arms were raised in response . <P> This was not a vast , much-publicized Billy Graham crusade like those that have drawn millions of people throughout the non-Communist world . The audiences on the hillside and in subsequent overflow church meetings were made up of devout Protestants , not the general public . To make sure of that , Hungary 's state-run media carried no advance notices of the gatherings . <P> For all that , the Hungary trip , which resulted from five years of negotiations , was a well-calculated breakthrough . Graham 's only previous preaching in a Communist nation was a low-key appearance ten years ago in nonaligned Yugoslavia . The Danube tour was also a historic occasion for Graham 's official host , Hungary 's Council of Free Churches . It represents 50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reformed and Lutheran bodies in Hungary , but very much a minority in a country that was two-thirds Catholic at the time of the Communist takeover . <P> To some extent , the visit was part of a broad tactical maneuver by the Communist regime of Jnos Kdr . On the brink of next month 's talks on the Helsinki accord , Hungary is eager to brush up its image and counteract complaints about church restrictions from both Hungarian and U.S. Christians . In fact , Hungary probably has the most liberal church policy among Warsaw Pact countries . Sunday schools and youth retreats are permitted . Bibles , though expensive , are available . Even so , open evangelism and freedom of church publication in the Western sense are unknown . Evangelical Christians are customarily excluded from the universities and the professions . <P> Kdr has actively been wooing the Vatican , and since last year all Catholic bishoprics in Hungary have been filled . Next week three top-ranking U.S. Catholic bishops will arrive for a good-will tour . One of Kdr 's major goals , it appears , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the U.S.
