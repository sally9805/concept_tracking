txt The issue that has dominated political discussion in the United States for five years and did much to cause Lyndon B. Johnson not to seek re-election ? the war in Indochina  --  seems to be playing a minor role in the 1970 mid-term Congressional elections . This , at least , is the judgment of political leaders interviewed here and in all 50 states . " While everybody is concerned about the war and while it is probably the paramount issue in their minds , it is not the issue that is going to decide their votes , " declared James H. Weaver , Democratic challenger for the House seat held by Representative John R. Dellenback in Oregon 's Fourth Congressional District . Adds Mr. Dellenback , in a comment typical of hundreds gathered in the sur-vey : " There is much greater unanimity that the road Nixon is following is a sound road . It could blow sky-high - if there is a change in direction . But people seem to be persuaded that the President is absolutely sincere about de-escalating and getting us out of Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are , of course , exceptions to this general rule . Vietnam has made a difference in some parts of Massachusetts , and may yet have some impact in Senatorial contests in North Dakota , New York , Tennessee and Ohio and in some Congressional races elsewhere . But , on balance , a combination of factors appears to have helped neutralize the war as a saleable issue for either proNixon Republicans or more dovish Democrats : the President 's policy of steady troop , withdrawals , coupled with his frequent assertions that " Vietnamization Is working " ; the fact that many competing can-I ( Mates now hold almost identical positions ; public confusion ' and public weariness , and the emergence of other issues of greater immediate significance to local voters . Further Neutralization Mr. Nixon 's most recent peace initiative  --  the standstill cease-fire proposal of Oct. 7 ? appears not to have had a major impact , unless it has been to neutralize the war issue even further . It has , however , resulted in a few odd and amusing episodes as candidates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to lodge assertions that they were already onboard before Mr. Nixon offered his proposal . In Indiana , for example , Where the dovish Democratic Senator , Vance Hartke , and his hawkish challenger , Representative Richard L. Roudebush , have both carefully avoided the war issue , news of Mr. Nixon 's peace offering i momentarily brought the issue alive again . Mr. Hartke beat Mr. Roudebush to the punch by commending Mr. Nixon for " offering a series of proposals which I have prayed for and worked toward for almost five years . " Angered , Mr. Roudebush said that any similarity between the proposals offered by the president and Mr. Hartke 's record was " inconceivable . " In the rush , meanwhile , representative William G. Bray , a Republican running for re-election in Indiana 's sixth district , even quoted a Democrat in an effort to align himself with the President : " Al Smith , one-time Governor of New York and Democratic candidate for the President , always said , " Let 's look at the record . " With that , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cease fire offer . Similarly , in Tennessee , both Senatorial candidates hurried to embrace the President . Again the Democrat got there first , as Senator Albert Gore , the incumbent , endorsed the move ? and recalled That he had proposed a cease-fire as eary as May 5 , 1965 . His Republican challenger , Representative William E. Brock 3d , accused Mr. Gore of a " demagogic " effort to capitalize on the President 's proposals and said that only the success of the Cambodian incursion  --  which Mr. Gore had opposed and Mr. Brock supported ? had made it possible for the President to take a dovish tack now and offer fresh negotiating package in Paris . Benefits for Democrats Ironically , as the Indiana and Tennessee episodes suggest , Democrats who can claim to have proposed a cease-fire may benefit as much by associating themselves with the President 's proposal as their Republican opponents . This has been in the case in Minnesota , where Hubert H. Humphrey has been calling for a standstill cease-fire and busily shedding his long record of support for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been asserting that he  --  as a Republican and a member of the President 's ' party  --  should rightfully get credit for Mr. Nixon 's proposal , but his own record has been consistently hawkish . In most states , however , the peace proposal has not revived the Indochina war as a major issue , and even in Tennessee , Indiana and Minnesota the election is not likely to turn on whether one candidate or the other seizes the credit for it . Most observers tend to agree with Maine 's Democratic national committeeman , George .1 . Mitchell of Portland , who said in an interview : . " The Indochina war is not an issue . I think he Nixon has skillfully defused it . His turning it around and bringing the soldiem back home has taken the heat off the subject . The ceasefire effort has merely helped the cooling-off process along . " china Is not a decisive issue are Massachusetts and possibly North Dakota . In Massachusetts , it is widely conceded that the upset victory of a Jesuit priest , the Rev. Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , in the Democratic primary , was based in a large part on Mr. Drinan 's full-blown opposition to the war and his vocalsupport for the Amendment and other legislative efforts to require the President to establish a deadline for full troop withdrawal . But the war issue has not cut as deeply elsewhere in the state , and Mr. Drinan 's campaign manager points out that his district  --  the Third  --  is one of the most dovish in the nation . In North Dakota , the Indochina issue remains alive , observers report , in part because the Republican challenger , Representative Thomas S. Kleppe , has spent large funds on a television campaign designed to paint the incumbent , Senator Quentin N. Burdick , a Democrat , as an enemy of a " reasonable solution " in Vietnam , an advocate of unlateral withdrawal , and a friend of " radical " student elements . But even the North Dakota issue is not so much Mr. Bt-xdick 's war views  --  in mid-1968 , he was regarded as something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with left-wing students . Mr. Kleppe 's TV spots show scraggly kids haranguing against the war . " People may not know how they feel about the war , " says one Kleppe strategist , " and they may not be able to see much difference between the President 's policy of gradual withdrawal and Mr. Burdick 's hopes for a quick withdrawal . But they do know how they feel about hippies . " In the absence of the war as an issue , both parties have turned elsewhere , according to the survey . Republicans are stressing the themes of law and order and campus dissent in almost every part of the country , much as Vice President Agnew is doing in his nationwide barnstorming . ' Democrats , meanwhile , are blaming Mr. Nixon and their Republican opponents for inflation and the economic slowdown , while candidates for both parties have eagerly embraced the conservation and ' environmental issue . A good illustration of the importance of these issues relative to Vietnam was provided last week in Utah , where both Senatorial candidates , Frank E. Moss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laurence J. Burton , endorsed the President 's peace proposal . But in a full column in The Salt Lake Tribune , in which he praised the cease-fire effort , Mr. Burton expressed his belief ? and the belief of most candidates this year ? that the election would turn on other issues . In his final sentence , he wrote : " With peace more than a remote possibility in Vietnam , I am concerned with ending another kind of war also , the war on the streets and campuses , bombing of buildings , ' mindless murders of our police . " Massachusetts Upset Political observers in Michigan echo much the same view , noting that most people are tired of the war and believe that Mr. Nixon is , too . " Magically , bipartisanship in foreign policy has suddenly been restored , " The Detroit News commented editorially last week after Mr. Nixon 's cease-fire offer . Adds a top Republican campaign strategist : " Everybody wants to wrap it up as quickly as we reasonably can . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
