Call it a revival , mark it down to a turn of fashion 's wheel . The mannequins who strode , twirled and postured through Paris ' haute couture salons last week in new spring and summer collections looked as if they had just stepped out of a Jean Harlow or Greta Garbo movie . Hemlines had dropped to midcalf ; necklines plunged revealingly ; clothes were flowingly full again . This evocation of what may have been couture 's grandest era-from the mid-1920s to the late ' 30s-was not simply a salute to nostalgia . The designers seemed to be saying that high fashion belongs to those with a yearning for bygone elegance-and the means to afford some very up-to-date prices . <P> Gone from most salons was the sculptured , hard-edge look pioneered by Courreges , Cardin and Gernreich . No more tight minis . No plastic helmets or vinyl unisex jumpsuits . Instead , the emphasis is once again on the most basic of feminine garments : the dress . Liberated from the crisp , form-fitted lines of recent seasons , it now billows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest-selling thing in stores is pants , " said Designer Oscar de la Renta , whose own new collection opened last week in New York . " The dress is in . " <P> One key to the change lies in France 's exquisite fabrics-luxuriant silk , crepe de chine , shantung , georgette , satin . These are meticulously cut and joined , often on the diagonal introduced in the 1920s by Madeleine Vionnet - who is inactive but still alert at 97 . The " bias cut " makes clothes drape sexily against the body . Since the favored fabrics of 1974 are gossamer-thin and always unlined , they need , even demand ample length to prevent skirts from being unintentionally hoisted at the slightest breeze . The result is a calf-length skirt that is wider , freer and not quite as long as the ill-fated midi of 1970 . <P> Eye to Provocation . The 1930s theme was echoed by every Paris couturier from Givenchy , Balmain , Scherrer and Lapidus to Dior , St. Laurent and Chanel . Marc Bohan , Dior 's successor , set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His jackets , closed at the waist with a narrow belt , were full and casual . Evening dresses , as diaphanous as lingerie , hint of luxury-and bed . <P> Sexist ? Surely ; but also sexy-and elegant . Take Bohan 's shirts , which were lavishly applauded by buyers and critics alike . Some of the most striking were deliberately provocative with deep , insouciant necklines or low square necks and thin shoulder straps . What to wear under these blouses ? According to the designers , absolutely nothing . <P> Yves St. Laurent accented femininity even in suits tailored in men 's checkered or pin-stripe fabrics . They are worn with print , tie-neck , full blouses that ease into soft yokes in back and bands at wrist or elbow . St. Laurent 's beloved tunic reappeared , belted over wide pants or pleated skirts . For daytime dresses , he used every sort of pleat-box , inverted , knife , flat , broad-to gain an almost subliminal , flickering effect .                 @ @ @ @
