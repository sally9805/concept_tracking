txt ON THE NIGHT of April 27 , Frank Collin , local Nazi leader , called David Goldberger , Ameri-mn CUM Libert1/2s Union attorney , and asked Goldberger to represent him the next morning in court . For Goldberger and the ACLU , the call was not exactly a welcome one . Collin was going to court because he wanted to lead his Nazis , complete with storm-trooper uniforms and swastikas , in a demonstration in Skokie , a suburb with a large Jewish population , a suburb containing many survivors of the infamy that was Nazi Germany . Skokie officials were taking legal steps to stop him . ? Unwelcome as the call was , Goldberger and David Hamlin , ACLU executive director , believe they had no choice ? for more than half a century the ACLU has defended the right of free speech guaranteed in the First Amendment to the United states Constitution . GOLDBERGER , FINDING the prospect of representing Collin " quite ' unpleasant , " first tried to line up a voltinteer ACLU attorney to go into court . He could fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorneys to go into court with me , " he said . Some said they were busy ; " others just preferred not to step into it . " And so it came down to Goldberger , a First Amendment specialist . He went to court to argue for the Nazis ' right of free speech , and the ACLU has been suffering ever since . By August , Hamlin was estimating the Illinois chapter would lose a quarter // Close-up with Dorothy Collin Nazi case has ACLU on defensive // of its membership because of Rs representation of the Nazis . MONDAY , HAMLIN said : " We are beginning to see our 1978 membership figures which suggest we 've probably lost 30 per cent of our membership . " That means that , in addition to the members who resigned in protest , other members are not renewing their ACLU memberships . It means the Illinois chapter may have lost as many as 2,700 members . It also means the chapter may lose 30 per cent of its donations , which does n't do much for Its $210,000 budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hamlin said . " Everything we do will suffer . " Perhaps five of the 13 staff members will have to be let go , Hamlin said . But the cuts that will really hurt will be the ones In the ACLU caseload . " WE WILL HAVE to take a much closer look at cases ' impact both legally and financially , " Hamlin said . " We have a fairly extensive docket we are committed to , but new cases will have to be examined carefully . We will have to take fewer cases . " For those unfamiliar with the ACLU , this means cases such as defending a student 's rights on , say , a dress code or a ban on long hair , would probably not be fought . It means the many , many cases aimed at upholding a constitutional right , which may not be landmark cases , would not receive the ACLU 's traditional counsel . It means people with nowhere else to go will now have nowhere to go . The defense of the Nazis ' right to free speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1960 , the New York ACLU represented George Lincoln Rockwell , the late Nazi leader , in a Close-up free-speech case . The national organization lost many members in protest . THE ILLINOIS CHAPTER has represented Collin on and off for seven years , since ho walked through the door as an " intake case , " But Hamlin is quick to point out that the ACLU has represented anyone whose free-speech rights are in question , from Nazis to Communists , from the Ku Klux Klan to the Dr. Martin Luther King Movement , the black group that recently won the right to march in Marquette Park . Never has the organization gotten the reaction it has from the Skokie case . Goldberger thinks " emotions are so strong that pdople ca n't engage in analysis . I ca n't remember a case which generated such animosity against free speech as this one . " , And certainly , Goldberger and Hamlin can see why members , especially Jews , might be enraged , why those who support the idea of free speech do n't want their money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they think other factors are at work , too , perhaps the same ones that have made many Americans tired of loud voices and loud protests , of big issues and big demands for rights . DURING THE 19600 , the interests of the ACLU corresponded with the interests of many liberal and even moderates . There were civil rights and the antiwar and antldraft movements , then the impeachment of Richard Nixon . " But now , in my view , we are past that time , " Hamlin said . The issues of equal rights for gays , of reverse discrimination , of the right to have an abortion , of the Equal Rights Amendmeat , have run up against a backlash . " The climate changes and I think Frank Collin is part of the package , " Hamlin said . " There is a remarkable drop in tolerance for divergent views in this country . " Not only do people disagree with certain views , but they prefer not to hear them . Not only do people disagree with Collin , but they wish he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change In times , Hamlin thinks the ACLU chapter would have lost membership anyway and , indeed , the national organization has been losing members . " But we ca n't deny the Skokie impact , " he said . One of the most ironic results of the Collin case is the charge by some that the ACLU , condemned for generations by conservatives as a " pinko-Commie " group , is a Right-wing organization , that it agrees with Nazi doctrine . " That kind of statement is made by people who do n't know what the ACLU does , " Hamlin said . " I take it as a personal and institutional insult . " Another irony is that a Nazi is defended by a Jewish attorney . Goldberger said it is a client-lawyer relationship . But " while every lawyer dreams of the , limelight , this is no way to get it , " he said . " I would Just as soon this would not have happened . " He said his family and friends have been loyal , " though I 'm sure many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collin said : " I will do literally anything , including an alliance with the devil , to get my First Amendment rights back . " I asked him how he could justify being defended by a Jew . " I never said every single Jew was part of the conspiracy , " he said . " Goldberger is one of the few Jeivs who is an honest man . " Maybe the last word on this should come from the national executive director of the ACLU , a man named Aryeh Neter who is a refugee from Nazi Germany and who lost several relatives in the holocaust . " The time to resist tyranny is right at the start , " he said . " You do not let a government agency ever slur vou4cannot express your views , That is how you prevent the Auschwitzes , "
