txt Leonid I. Brezhnev stands more solidly than ever at the top of the Kremlin hierarchy . The Soviet Union 's ruling troika remains in harness . But the burly general secretary has further consolidated his power with the addition of four new members to an en-larged Politburo , two of when are closely identified with him . What the changes announced on the last day of the 24th party congress Friday will mean ultimately only time will tell . In any event , political observers here see no basic change in policies or in the character of the leadership . The trend is one of continuity  --  a trend firmly evidenced in the proceedings of the 10-day congress . Newcomers introduced The new Politburo has 15 full members , including 3 who were elevated from their former positions as candidate members . The four newcomers are : ? Viktor V. Grishin , 57 , a locomotive engineer by training , was head of the Soviet trade unions between 1956 and ' 67 , during which time he made many trips abroad . He was made a candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first secretary of the Moscow city party committee . ? Dinmukhamed A. Kunayev , 59 , has been party leader of the important Republic of Kazakhstan since 1964 . In the 1950 's he was premier of the Kazakh Republic at the time Mr. Brezhnev was first party secretary there . His election points to Kazakhstan 's growing role in the Soviet economy . // *Brezhnev firms rein as troika rides on // ? Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky , 53 , has been Premier of the Ukraine since 1965 . He is a graduate of a chemical institute and in the mid- ' 50 's served as a party chief in Dnepropetrovsk , where Mr. Brezhnev was also once a local party leader . He became a candidate member of the Politburo in 1966 . ? Fyodor D. Kulakov , 53 , not previously a candidate member , is a trained agronomist . He was deputy minister of agriculture and later minister of grain production in the huge Russian Federation . He was party head of the farming area of Stavropol Territory in 1960 and was named to the Central Committee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Politburo symbolizes the regime 's current drive to pull up the nation 's lagging farm front . It could be that the leadership wanted a technical expert aboard . Podgorny put second Otherwise the composition of the Politburo is the same . The ruling triumvirate remains : Mr. Brezhnev ; Nikolai V. Podgorny , President of the Supreme Soviet ; and Alexei N. Kosygin , Premier . This is the order in which Mr. Brezhnev solemnly read out the names , and one is struck by the fact that Mr. Kosygin was listed third instead of second , as he was in 1966 . Some political observers here believe this may simply be a matter of protocol and does not represent a diminution of Mr. Kosygin 's power . In the recent past the Soviet press has consistently listed the leaders in this order . Other shifts in the Politburo lineup are also eye-catching . Gennady I. Voronov , for instance , has slipped from 5th place in 1966 to 10th place . Alexander N. Shelepin , the relatively youthful trade-union chief often regarded as the chief rival to Mr. Brezhnev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes him last among the members of the old Politburo ) . The fact that Mr. Shelepin did not deliver the trade-union speech at the congress also points to his diminished status . Two non-Russians added The reshuffling of the leadership adds two non-Russian nationalities to the Politburo Mr. Kunayev is a Kazakh , and Mr. Shcherbitsky a Ukrainian . The 15-man Politburo thus has a total of five non-Russians , including Pyotr Y. Shelest , a Ukrainian , Arvids Y Pelse , a Latvian , and Kirill T. Mazurov , a Byelorussian . The elevation of Mr. Kunayev will be particularly pleasing to the Asian minorities of the Soviet Union , who have not been represented on the Politburo since 1961 . No other appointments were made to fill the vacancies of candidate members , the number of which now stands at 6 . The important 10-man Secretariat , which carries out day-to-day affairs of the party , remains intact . Four powerful men of the Politburo , Mr. Brezhnev , Mikhail A Suslov , Andrei P. Kirilenko , and Mr. Kulakov. are in the Secretariat as well . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out : the general stability of the present leadership , which has endured longer than the post-Stalin leadership . The Soviet Union today , where there has been no major political change in six years , is one of the most stable governments in the world . As for Mr. Brezhnev , he dominated the 24th congress , indicating again his preeminence among the top leadership . He was personally praised by many speakers and his own six-hour report was televised live to the nation . Only two other members of the Politburo addressed the congress .
