LIKE some cosmic drum roll , the rumble of thunder accompanied the wild winds and torrential rains that swept across most of Indochina last week , heralding the advent of the southwesterly monsoon . From the air , thousands of acres of paddyland glistened in the infrequent sunshine like a vast mirror . By the time the storms abate in October they will have dumped up to 150 inches of rain on the region , turning the ground into a muddy sponge and swelling the majestic Mekong River to flood stage as it courses through Laos , Cambodia and South Viet Nam . <P> With roads washed out , bogging down allied and Communist troops alike , and with low ceilings grounding helicopters and jets much of the time , the monsoon has traditionally brought a welcome respite to Indochina 's battlefields . On the U.S. side , a slowdown in activity was already evident at the beginning of the month as the withdrawal proceeded ; in the week ending June 5 , American fatalities fell to 19 , the lowest seven-day toll since October 1965 . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season begins this year . In selected areas , Communist troops are not only maintaining the pressure but , despite the rains , seem intent on increasing it . <P> Though the Communists control very little territory in South Viet Nam , during the past year they have dramatically expanded their control over parts of Laos and Cambodia . In fact , the North Vietnamese army ( NVA ) now controls more real estate on the borders of Viet Nam than ever before . From the Sino-Laotian frontier in the north to the tiny crossroads town of Snuol in the south , Hanoi 's troops are masters of an area that measures 840 miles long and 250 miles wide at its broadest point ( see map ) . <P> Traction for Trucks . This assures the Communists of access to the Mekong and , most important , provides security for the Ho Chi Minh Trail . Although ARVN ( Army of the Republic of Viet Nam ) troops , with U.S. air support , inflicted considerable damage during the Lam Son 719 thrust into Laos and made parts of the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply network westward and widening it in the bargain . Thus , in recent weeks , Communist activity along the trail has been running at twice the normal rate . U.S. aerial reconnaissance has revealed piles of bamboo and mounds of gravel at many points along the route , indicating that the Communists hope to provide traction for supply trucks no matter how muddy the going gets . <P> To improve security for the trail , the Communists last month pushed the Laotian army completely off the strategic Bolovens Plateau , deep in southern Laos . Possession of the plateau not only gives the NVA control of the heights overlooking the Ho Chi Minh Trail , but also of a landscape so wild that a full division can assemble there without being spotted from the air . Seeking to further improve their supply network , the Communists continue to battle along Route 23.
