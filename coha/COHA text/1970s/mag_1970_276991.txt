DECENT AND INDECENT : OUR PERSONAL AND POLITICAL BEHAVIOR by Benjamin Spock , M.D. 210 pages . McCall . $5.95 . <P> <P> " You know more than you think you do , " Benjamin Spock reassured mothers at the opening of Baby and Child Care . Your baby " can care for himself pretty well . " Spock 's message , which has sold more than 23 million copies was a pacifier for parents . But as everyone knows by now , the doctor who shaped the care and feeding of the babies who have become America 's most restive generation is troubled about the nation in which they have grown up . <P> His title proclaims Spock 's values : not good v. evil so much as decency v. indecency . Spock is an almost luminously decent man himself . If translated into a television series , he might well be played by Robert Young . Despite his defiant opposition to the war in Viet Nam , the edifice of his thought is a white clapboard New England house where tolerance , patience and kindliness prevail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an articulate and increasingly outraged social concern . It is difficult to imagine " Marcus Welby , M.D. ' ' standing trial for conspiracy to subvert the nation 's draft laws . <P> Decent and Indecent is a series of essays , not a systematic treatise . Spock apparently could not decide whether he was writing an edification manual for a general audience or an outraged diatribe against the Establishment . In fact , Spock speaks in a bewilderment of voices : part Dear Abby , part pop anthropology , part sex manual , part vintage Spock ( " When , during toilet training , he feels cross at his mother , he may withhold the B.M. " ) . At times , though entirely truthful , he is also relentlessly obvious : " Black people continue to be identified and barred by their color . " <P> For all his indignation , Spock is engagingly oldfashioned . He is by no means a total permissivist . The closer he gets to home , the more Spock embraces a traditional , family-centered morality that a Nixonian nation would approve . Stubbornly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The battle for some reasonable enlightenment has been won , he says , but " now it is mainly writers , artists and producers with little discernible artistic or social integrity who are leading the assault on standards . " Members of Women 's Liberation ( Kche , Kinder und Karate ) will pulverize a few more practice bricks when they read Spock 's thoughts on the woman 's role : " It would be fairer to women if they were brought up at home and educated in such a spirit that they would enjoy , feel proud of , and be fascinated by child-rearing rather than frustrated by it . " <P> In his best , most intense passages , the doctor castigates the nation 's institutionalized offenses-among them : social injustice , pollution , and a war brought on by what Spock calls " paranoid self-deception . " His moral objection to that war led Spock to join the antiwar movement . But perhaps because no pediatrician would ever throw out the baby with the bath water , Spock shies away from the violent implications of revolutionary radicalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
