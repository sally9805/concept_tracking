 | The sirens were very close now ; through the windows they saw an ambulance back into the slot . Two orderlies opened the door and pulled out the stretcher . A frail elderly woman lay on the stretcher , gasping for breath , making wet gurgling sounds . Severe pulmonary edema , Morris thought as he watched her taken into one of the treatment rooms . " I hope he 's in good shape , " Ellis said . " Who ? " " Benson . " " Why should n't he be ? " " They might have roughed him up . " Ellis stared morosely out the windows . He really is in a bad mood , Morris thought . He knew that meant Ellis was excited ; he had scrubbed in on enough cases with Ellis to recognize the pattern . Irascibility under pressure while he waited  --  and then total , almost lazy calm when the operation began . " Where the hell is he ? " Ellis said , looking at his watch again . To change the subject , Morris said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At 3:30 that afternoon , Benson would be presented to the hospital staff at a special Neurosurgical Rounds . " As far as I know , " Ellis said . " Ross is making the presentation . I just hope Benson 's in good shape . " Over the loudspeaker , a soft voice said , " Dr. Ellis , Dr. John Ellis , two-two-three-four . Dr. Ellis , two-two-threefour . " Ellis got up to answer the page . " Hell , " he said . Morris knew what he meant . Two-two-three-four was the extension for the animal laboratories . The call probably meant something had gone wrong with the monkeys . Ellis had been doing three monkeys a week for the past month , just to keep himself and his staff ready .  | He watched as Ellis crossed the room and answered from a wall phone . Ellis walked with a slight limp , the result of a childhood injury that had cut the lateral peroneal nerve in his right leg . Morris always wondered if the injury had had something to do with Ellis 's later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of a man determined to correct defects , to fix things up . That was what he always said to his patients : " We can fix you up . " And he seemed to have more than his share of defects himself  --  the limp , the premature near-baldness , the weak eyes , and the heavy thick glasses . It produced a vulnerability about him that made his irascibility more tolerable . Or perhaps the irascibility was the result of all those years as a surgeon . Morris was n't sure ; he had n't been a surgeon long enough . He stared out the window at the sunlight and the parking lot . Afternoon visiting hours were beginning ; relatives were driving into the parking lot , getting out of their cars , glancing up at the high buildings of the hospital . The apprehension was clear in their faces ; the hospital was a place people feared . Morris noticed how many of them had sun tans . It had been a warm , sunny spring in Los Angeles , yet he was still as pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had to get outside more often , he told himself . He should start eating lunch outside . He played tennis , of course , but that was usually in the evenings . Ellis came back . " Shit , " he said . " Ethel tore out her sutures . " " How did it happen ? " Ethel was a juvenile rhesus monkey who had undergone brain surgery the day before . The operation had proceeded flawlessly . And Ethel was unusually docile , as rhesus monkeys went . " I do n't know , " Ellis said . " Apparently she worked an  | arm loose from her restraints . Anyway , she 's shrieking and the bone 's exposed on one side . " " Did she tear out her wires ? " ' " I do n't know . But I 've got to go down and resew her now . Can you handle this ? " " I think so . " " Are you all right with the cops ? " Ellis said . " I do n't think they 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think so . " " Just get Benson up to seven as fast as you can , " Ellis said . " Then call Ross . I 'll be up as soon as possible . " He checked his watch . " It 'll probably take forty minutes to resew Ethel , if she behaves herself . " " Good luck with her , " Morris said , and smiled . Ellis looked sour and walked away . After he had gone , the emergency ward nurse came back . " What 's the matter with him ? " she asked . " Just edgy , " Morris said . " He sure is , " the nurse said . She paused and looked out the window , lingering . Morris watched her with a kind of bemused detachment . He 'd spent enough years in the hospital to recognize the subtle signs of status . He had begun as an intern , with no status at all . Most of the nurses knew more medicine than he did , and if they were tired they did n't bother to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do that , Doctor . " ) As the years went by , he became a surgical resident , and the nurses became more deferential . When he was a senior resident , he was sufficiently assured in his work that a few of the nurses called him by his first name . And finally , when he transferred to the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit as a junior staff member , the formality returned as a new mark of status . But this was something else : a nurse hanging around , Tuesday , March 9 , 1971 : Admission 7  | just being near him , because he had a special aura of importance . Because everyone in the hospital knew what was going to happen . Staring out the window , the nurse said , " Here he comes . " Morris got up and looked out . A blue police van drove up toward the emergency ward , and turned around , backing into the ambulance slot . " All right , " he said . " Notify the seventh floor , and tell them we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The nurse went off . Two ambulance orderlies opened the hospital doors . They knew nothing about Benson . One of them said to Morris , " You expecting this one ? " " Yes . " " EW case ? " " No , a direct admission . " The orderlies nodded , and watched as the police officer driving the van came around and unlocked the rear door . Two officers seated in the back emerged , blinking in the sunlight . Then Benson came out . As always , Morris was struck by his appearance . Benson was a meek , pudgy , thirty-four-year-old man , with a sort of permanently bewildered air about him . He stood 1 ) y the van , with his wrists handcuffed in front of him , and looked around . When he saw Morris , he said , " Hello , " and then looked away , embarrassed . One of the cops said , " You in charge here ? " " Yes . I 'm Dr. Morris . " The cop gestured toward the interior of the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Would you mind taking off his handcuffs ? " Benson 's eyes flicked up at Morris , then back down . " We do n't have any orders about that . " The cops exchanged glances . " I guess it 's okay . "  | While they took the cuffs off , the driver brought Morris a form on a clipboard : " Transfer of Suspect to Institutional Care ( Medical ) . " He signed it . " And again here , " the driver said . As Morris signed again , he looked at Benson . Benson stood quietly , rubbing his wrists , staring straight ahead . The impersonality of the transaction , the forms and signatures , made Morris feel as if he were receiving a package from United Parcel . He wondered if Benson felt like a package . " Okay , " the driver said . " Thanks , Doc . " Morris led the other two policemen and Benson into the hospital . The orderlies shut the doors . A nurse came up with a wheelchair and Benson sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hospital policy , " Morris said . They all went to the elevators . The elevator stopped at the lobby . A half-dozen relatives were waiting to go up to the higher floors , but they hesitated when they saw Morris , Benson in the wheelchair , and the two cops . " Please take the next car , " Morris said smoothly . The doors closed . They continued up . " Where is Dr. Ellis ? " Benson asked . " I thought he was going to be here . " " He 's in surgery . He 'll be up shortly . " " And Dr. Ross ? " " You 'll see her at the presentation . " " Oh , yes . " Benson smiled . " The presentation . " The cops exchanged suspicious looks , but said nothing . The elevator arrived at the seventh floor , and they all got out . Seven was the Special Surgical floor , where difficult and Tuesday , March 9 , 1971 : Admission 9  | complex cases were treated . It was essentially a research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metabolic patients recuperated here . They went down to the nurses ' station , a glass-walled area strategically located at the center of the X-shaped floor . The nurse on duty at the station looked up . She was surprised to see the cops , but she said nothing . Morris said , This is Mr. Benson . Have we got seven-ten ready ? " " All set for him , " the nurse said , and gave Benson a cheery smile . Benson smiled bleakly back , and glanced from the nurse to the computer console in the corner of the nursing station . " You have a time-sharing station up here ? " " Yes , " Morris said . " Where 's the main computer ? " " In the basement . " " Of this building ? " " Yes . It draws a lot of power , and the power lines come to this building . " Benson nodded . Morris was not surprised at the questions . Benson was trying to distract himself from the thought of surgery , and he was , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart on Benson . It had the usual blue plastic cover with the seal of University Hospital . But there was also a red tag , which meant neurosurgery , and a yellow tag , which meant intensive care , and a white tag , which Morris had almost never seen on a patient 's chart . The white tag meant security precautions . " Is that my record ? " Benson asked as Morris wheeled him down the hall to 710 . The cops followed along behind . " Uh-huh . " " I always wondered what was in it . " " Lot of unreadable notes , mostly . " Actually , Benson 's  | chart was thick and very readable , with all the computer print-outs of different tests . They came to 710 . Before they entered the room , one of the cops went in and closed the door behind him . The second cop remained outside the door . " Just a precaution , " he said . Benson glanced up at Morris . " They 're very careful about me , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cop came out . " It 's okay , " he said . Morris wheeled Benson into the room . It was a large room , on the south side of the hospital , so that it was sunny in the afternoon . Benson looked around and nodded approvingly . Morris said , " This is one of the best rooms in the hospital . " " Can I get up now ? " " Of course . " Benson got out of the wheelchair and sat on the bed . He bounced on the mattress . He pressed the buttons that made the bed move up and down , then bent over to look at the motorized mechanism beneath the bed . Morris went to the window and drew the blinds , reducing the direct light . " Simple , " Benson said . " What 's that ? " " This bed mechanism . Remarkably simple . You should really have a feedback unit so that body movements by the person in the bed are automatically compensated for ... " His voice trailed off . He opened the closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Morris thought that he was n't acting like an ordinary patient . Most patients were intimidated by the hospital , but Benson acted as if he were renting a hotel room . " I 'll take it , " Benson said , and laughed . He sat down on the bed and looked at Morris , then at the cops . " Do they have to be here ? " Tuesday , March 9 , 1971 : Admission 11  | " I think they can wait outside , " Morris said . The cops nodded and went out , closing the door behind them . " I meant , " Benson said , " do they have to be here at all ? " " Yes , they do . " " All the time ? " " Yes . Unless we can get charges dropped against you . " Benson frowned . " Was it . . . I mean , did I . . . Was it bad ? " " You gave him a black eye and you fractured one rib . " " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . " " I do n't remember any of it , " Benson said . " All my memory cores are erased . " " I know that . " " But I 'm glad he 's all right . " Morris nodded . " Did you bring anything with you ? Pajamas , anything like that ? " Benson said , " No . But I can arrange for it . " " All right . I 'll get you some hospital clothing in the meantime . Are you all right for now ? " " Yes . Sure . " And he grinned . " I could do with a quick shot , maybe . " " That , " Morris said , grinning back , " is something you 'll have to do without . " Benson sighed . Morris went out of the room . The cops had brought a chair up to the door . One of them sat on it , the other stood alongside . Morris flipped open his notebook . " You 'll want to know the schedule , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next half hour with finan-  | cial waivers for Benson to sign . Then , at three-thirty he goes downstairs to the main amphitheater for Surgical Rounds . He comes back after about twenty minutes . His head will be shaved tonight . The operation is scheduled for six a.m. tomorrow morning . Do you have questions ? " " Can someone get us meals ? " one of them asked . " I 'll have the nurse order extras . Will there be two of you , or just one ? " " Just one . We 're working eight-hour shifts . " Morris said , " I 'll tell the nurses . It 'd help if you check in and out with them . They like to know who 's on the floor . " The cops nodded . There was a moment of silence . Finally , one of them said , " What 's wrong with him , any-way ? " " He has a form of epilepsy . " " I saw the guy he beat up , " one of the cops said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd never think a little guy like that "  --  - he jerked his arm toward Benson 's room ? " could do it . " " When he has epileptic fits , he 's violent . " They nodded vaguely . " What 's this operation he 's get-ting ? " " It 's a kind of brain surgery we call a stage-three procedure , " Morris said . He did n't bother to explain further . The policemen would n't understand . And , he thought , even if they understood , they would n't believe it .  | Neurosurgical Grand Rounds , where unusual cases were presented and discussed by all the surgeons of the hospital , were normally scheduled for Thursdays at nine . Special rounds were hardly ever called ; it was too difficult for the staff to get together . But now the amphitheater was packed , tier after tier of white jackets and pale faces staring down at Ellis , who pushed his glasses up on his nose and said , " As many of you know , tomorrow morning the Neuropsychiatric Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call a stage three  --  on a human patient . " There was no sound , no movement , from the audience . , Janet Ross stood in the corner of the amphitheater near the doors and watched . She found it odd that there should be so little reaction . But then it was hardly a surprise . Everyone in the hospital knew that the NPS had been waiting for a good stage-three subject . " I must ask you , " Ellis said , " to restrain your questions when the patient is introduced . He is a sensitive man , and his disturbance is quite severe . We thought you should have the psychiatric background before we bring him in . The attending psychiatrist , Dr. Ross , will give you a summary . " Ellis nodded to Ross . She came forward to the center of the room . She stared up at the steeply banked rows of faces and felt a momentary hesitation . Janet Ross was tall and exceptionally good-looking in a lean , tanned , dark-blond  | way . She herself felt she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more softly feminine . But she knew her appearance was striking , and at thirty , after more than a decade of training in a predominantly masculine profession , she had learned to use it . She clasped her hands behind her back , took a breath , and launched into the summary , delivering it in the rapid , stylized method that was standard for grand rounds . " Harold Franklin Benson , " she said , " is a thirty-fouryear-old divorced computer scientist who was healthy until two years ago , when he was involved in an automobile accident on the Santa Monica Freeway . Following the accident , he was unconscious for an unknown period of time . He was taken to a local hospital for overnight observation and discharged the next day in good health . He was fine for six months , until he began to experience what he called blackouts . ' " The audience was silent , faces staring down at her , listening . " These blackouts lasted several minutes , and occurred about once a month . They were often preceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackouts frequently occurred after drinking alcohol . The patient consulted his local physician , who told him he was working too hard , and recommended he reduce his alcohol intake . Benson did this , but the blackouts continued . " One year ago a year after the accident  --  he realized that the blackouts were becoming more frequent and lasting longer . He often regained consciousness to find himself in unfamiliar surroundings . On several occasions , he had cuts and bruises or torn clothing which suggested that he had been fighting . However , he never remembered what occurred during the blackout periods . " Heads in the audience nodded . They understood what Tuesday , March 9 , 1971 : Admission 15  | she was telling them ; it was a straightforward history for a temporal-lobe epileptic . The hard part was coming . " The patient 's friends , " she continued , " told him that he was acting differently , but he discounted their opinion . Gradually he has lost contact with most of his former friends . Around this time one year ago  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work . Benson is a computer scientist specializing in artificial life , or machine intelligence . In the course of this work , he says he discovered that machines were competing with human beings , and that ultimately machines would take over the world . " Now there were whispers in the audience . This interested them , particularly the psychiatrists . She could see her old teacher Manon sitting in the top row holding his head in his hands . Manon knew . " Benson communicated his discovery to his remaining friends . They suggested that he see a psychiatrist , which angered him . In the last year , he has become increasingly certain that machines are conspiring to take over the world . " Then , six months ago , the patient was arrested by police on suspicion of beating up an airplane mechanic . Positive identification could not be made , and charges were dropped . But the episode unnerved Benson and led him to seek psychiatric help . He had the vague suspicion that somehow he had been the man who had beaten the mechanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the nagging suspicion remained . " He was referred to the University Hospital Neuropsychiatric Research Unit four months ago , in November , 1970 . On the basis of his history  --  head injury , episodic violence preceded by strange smells  --  he was considered a probable psychomotor epileptic . As you know , the NPS  | now accepts only patients with organically treatable behavioral disturbances . " A neurological examination was fully normal . An electroencephalogram was fully normal ; brain-wave activity showed no pathology . It was repeated after alcohol ingestion and an abnormal tracing was obtained . The EEG showed seizure activity in the right temporal lobe of the brain . Benson was therefore considered a stage-one patient ? firm diagnosis of psychomotor epilepsy . " She paused to get her breath and let the audience absorb what she had told them . " The patient is an intelligent man , " she said , " and his illness was explained to him . He was told he had injured his brain in the automobile accident and , as a result , had a form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , not the body , leading to violent acts . He was told that the disease was common and could be controlled . He was started on a series of drug trials . " Three months ago , Benson was arrested on charges of assault and battery . The victim was a twenty-four-yearold topless dancer , who later dropped charges . The hospital intervened slightly on his behalf . " One month ago , drug trials of morladone , p-amino benzadone , and triamiline were concluded . Benson showed no improvement on any drug or combination of drugs . He was therefore a stage two  --  drug-resistant psychomotor epilepsy . And he was scheduled for a stage-three surgical procedure , which we will discuss today . " She paused . " Before I bring him in , " she said , " I think I should add that yesterday afternoon he attacked a gasstation attendant and beat the man rather badly . His operation is scheduled for tomorrow and we have persuaded the police to release him in our custody . But he is still Tuesday , March 9 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assault and battery . " The room was silent . She paused for a moment , then went to bring in Benson . Benson was just outside the doors to the amphitheater , sitting in his wheelchair , wearing the blue-andwhite striped bathrobe the hospital issued to its patients . When Janet Ross appeared , he smiled . " Hello , Dr. Ross . " " Hello , Harry . " She smiled back . " How do you feel ? " It was a polite question . After years of psychiatric training , she could see clearly how he felt . Benson was nervous and threatened : there was sweat on his upper lip , his shoulders were drawn in , his hands clenched together in his lap . " I feel fine , " he said . " Just fine . " Behind Benson was Morris , pushing the wheelchair , and a cop . She said to Morris , " Does he come in with us ? " Before Morris could answer , Benson said lightly , " He goes anywhere I go . " The cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . She opened the doors , and Morris wheeled Benson into the amphitheater , over to Ellis . Ellis came forward to shake Benson 's hand . " Mr. Benson , good to see you . " " Dr. Ellis . " Morris turned him around so he was facing the amphitheater audience . Ross sat to one side and glanced at the cop , who remained by the door trying to look inconspicuous . Ellis stood alongside Benson , who was looking at a wall of frosted glass , against which a dozen X-rays had  | been clipped . He seemed to realize that they were his own skull films . Ellis noticed , and turned off the light behind the frosted glass . The X-rays became opaquely black . " We 've asked you to come here , " Ellis said , " to answer some questions for these doctors . " He gestured to the men sitting in the semicircular tiers . " They do n't make you nervous , do they ? " Ellis asked it easily . Ross frowned . She 'd attended hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were invariably asked if the doctors peering down at them made them nervous . In answer to a direct question , the patients always denied nervousness . " Sure they make me nervous , " Benson said . " They 'd make anybody nervous . " Ross suppressed a smile . Good for you , she thought . Then Benson said , " What if you were a machine and I brought you in front of a bunch of computer experts who were trying to decide what was wrong with you and how to fix it ? How would you feel ? " Ellis was plainly flustered . He ran his hands through his thinning hair and glanced at Ross , and she shook her head fractionally no . This was the wrong place to explore Benson 's psychopathology . " I 'd be nervous , too , " Ellis said . " Well , then , " Benson said . " You see ? " Ellis swallowed . He 's being deliberately irritating , Ross thought . Do n't take the bait . " But , of course , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I ? " Ross winced . " That depends , " Benson said . " Certain of your functions are repetitive and mechanical . From that standpoint , they are easily programmed and relatively straightforward , if you ? " Tuesday , March 9 , 1971 : Admission 19  | " I think , " Ross said , standing up , " that we might take questions from those present now . " Ellis clearly did n't like that , but he was silent , and Benson mercifully was quiet . She looked up at the audience , and after a moment a man in the back raised his hand and said , " Mr. Benson , can you tell us more about the smells you have before your blackouts ? " " Not really , " Benson said . " They 're strange , is all . They smell terrible , but they do n't smell like anything , if you get what I mean . I mean , you ca n't identify the odor . Memory tapes cycle through blankly . " " Can you give us an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe . . . pig shit in turpentine . " Another hand in the audience went up . " Mr. Benson , these blackouts have been getting more frequent . Have they also been getting longer ? " " Yes , " Benson said . " They 're several hours now . " " how do you feel when you recover from a blackout ? " " Sick to my stomach . " " Can you be more specific ? " " Sometimes I vomit . Is that specific enough ? " Ross frowned . She could see that Benson was becoming angry . " Are there other questions ? " she asked , hoping there would not be . She looked up at the audience . There was a long silence . " Well , then , " Ellis said , " perhaps we can go on to discuss t tie details of stage-three surgery . Mr. Benson knows all this , so he can stay or leave , whichever he prefers . " Ross did n't approve . Ellis was showing off , the surgeon 's instinct for demonstrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mutilated . It was unfair to ask ? to dare  --  Benson to stay in the room . " I 'll stay , " Benson said . " Fine , " Ellis said . He went to the blackboard and drew 20 THE TERMINAL MAN  | a brain schematically . " Now , " he said , " our understanding of the disease process is that a portion of the brain is damaged in epilepsy , and a scar forms . It 's like a scar in other body organs  --  lots of fibrous tissue , lots of contraction and distortion . And it becomes a focus for abnormal electrical discharges . We see spreading waves moving outward from the focus , like ripples from a rock in a pond . " Ellis drew a point on the brain , then sketched concentric circles . " These electrical ripples produce a seizure . In some parts of the brain , the discharge focus produces a shaking fit , frothing at the mouth , and so on . In other parts , there are other effects . If the focus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , you get what is called psychomotor epilepsy ? convulsions of thought , not of body . Strange thoughts and frequently violent behavior , preceded by a characteristic aura which is often an odor . " Benson was watching , listening , nodding . " Now , then , " Ellis said , " we know from the work of many researchers that it is possible to abort a seizure by delivering an electrical shock to the correct portion of the brain substance . These seizures begin slowly . There are a few seconds  --  sometimes as much as half a minute ? before the seizure takes effect . A shock at that moment prevents the seizure . " He drew a large " X " through the concentric circles . Then he drew a new brain , and a head around it , and a neck . " We face two problems , " he said . " First , what is the correct part of the brain to shock ? Well , we know roughly that it 's in the amygdala , a posterior area of the so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we solve that problem by implanting a number of electrodes in the brain . Mr. Benson will have forty electrodes implanted tomorrow morning . "  | He drew two lines into the brain . " Now , our second problem is how do we know when an attack is starting ? We must know when to deliver our aborting shock . Well , fortunately the same electrodes that we use to deliver the shock can also be used to read ' the electrical activity of the brain . And there is a characteristic electrical pattern that precedes a seizure . " Ellis paused , glanced at Benson , then up at the audience . " So we have a feedback system  --  the same electrodes are used to detect a new attack , and to deliver the aborting shock . A computer controls the feedback mechanism . " He drew a small square in the neck of his schematic figure . " The NPS staff has developed a computer that will n o ntor electrical activity of the brain , and when it sees an attack starting , will transmit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about the size of a postage stamp and weighs a tenth of an ounce . It will be implanted beneath the skin of the patient 's neck . " I Ie then drew an oblong shape below the neck and attached wires to the computer square . " We will power the computer with a Handler PP-J plutonium power pack , which will be implanted beneath the skin of the shoulder . This makes the patient completely self-sufficient . The power pack supplies energy continuously and reliably for twenty years . " With his chalk , he tapped the different parts of his diagram . " That 's the complete feedback loop  --  brain , to electrodes , to computer , to power pack , back to brain . A total 1001 ) without any externalized portions . " I le turned to Benson , who had watched the discussion with an expression of bland disinterest . " Any comments ? Mr. Benson ? " Ross groaned inwardly . Ellis was really letting him have 22 THE TERMINAL MAN  | it . It was flagrantly sadistic  --  even for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have nothing to say . " And he yawned . When Benson was wheeled out of the room , Ross went with him . It was n't really necessary for her to accompany him , but she was concerned about his condition  --  and a little guilty about the way Ellis had treated him . She said , " How do you feel ? " " I thought it was interesting , " he said . " In what way ? " " Well , the discussion was entirely medical . I would have expected a more philosophical approach . " " We 're just practical people , " she said lightly , " dealing with a practical problem . " Benson smiled . " So was Newton , " he said . " What 's more practical than the problem of why an apple falls to the ground ? " " Do you really see philosophical implications in all this ? " Benson nodded . His expression turned serious . " Yes , " he said , " and so do you . You 're just pretending that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corridor , watching as Benson was wheeled down to the elevator . Benson , Morris , and the cop waited in the corridor for the next car . Morris pushed the button repeatedly in that impatient , aggressive way of his . Then the elevator arrived and they got on . Benson waved one last time , and the doors closed . She went back to the amphitheater . Tuesday , March 9 , 1971 : Admission 23  | ... has been under development for ten years , " Ellis was saying . " It was first started for cardiac pacemakers , where changing batteries requires minor surgery every year or so . That 's an annoyance to surgeon and patient . The atomic power pack is totally reliable and has a long life-span . If Mr. Benson is still alive , we might have to change packs around 1990 , but not before then . " Janet Ross slipped back into the room just as another question was asked : " How will you determine which of the forty electrodes will prevent a seizure ? " " We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire up the computer . But we will not lock in any electrodes for twentyfour hours . One day after surgery , we 'll stimulate each of the electrodes by radio and determine which electrodes work best . Then we will lock those in by remote control . " High up in the amphitheater , a familiar voice coughed and said , " These technical details are interesting , but they seem to me to elude the point . " Ross looked up and saw Manon speaking . Manon was nearly seventy-five , an emeritus professor of psychiatry who rarely came to the hospital any more . When he did , he was usually regarded as a cranky old man , far past his prime , out of touch with modern thinking . " It seems to me , " Manon continued , " that the patient is psychotic . " " That 's putting it a little strongly , " Ellis said . " Perhaps , " Manon said . " But , at the very least , he has a severe personality disorder . All this confusion about men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality disorder is part of his disease , " Ellis said . " In a recent review , Harley and co-workers at Yale reported that fifty percent of temporal-lobe epileptics had an accompanying personality disorder which was independent of seizure activity per se . " " Quite so , " Manon said , in a voice that had the slightest 24 THE TERMINAL MAN  | edge of impatience to it . " It is part of his disease , independent of seizures . But will your procedure cure it ? " Janet Ross found herself quietly pleased ; Manon was reaching exactly her own conclusions . " No , " Ellis said . " Probably not . " " In other words , the operation will stop his seizures , but it wo n't stop his delusions . " " No , " Ellis repeated . " Probably not . " " If I may make a small speech , " Manon said , frowning down from the top row , " this kind of thinking is what I fear most from the NPS . I do n't mean to single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical profession . For example , if we get a suicide attempt or a suicide gesture by drug overdose in the emergency ward , our approach is to pump the patient 's stomach , give him a lecture , and send him home .

" " I see what you 're saying , but ... " " I 'd also remind you of the hospital 's experience with Mr. L. Do you recall the case ? " " I do n't think Mr. L. applies here , " Ellis said . But his voice was stiff and exasperated . " I 'm not so sure , " Manon said . Since several puzzled faces in the amphitheater were turned toward him , he explained .

The psychiatrists on that board strongly opposed Mr. L. as a transplantation candidate , Tuesday , March 9 , 1971 : Admission 25  | because he was psychotic . He believed that the sun ruled the earth and he refused to go outside during the daylight hours . We felt he was too unstable to benefit from kidney surgery , but he ultimately received the operation . Six months later , he committed suicide . That 's a tragedy . But the real question is could n't someone else have benefited more from the thousands of dollars and many hours of specialized effort that went into the transplant . " Ellis paced back and forth , the foot of his bad leg scraping slightly along the floor . Ross knew it meant he was feeling threatened , under attack . Normally Ellis was careful to minimize his disability , concealing it so that the limp was noticeable only to a trained eye . But if he was tired , or angry , or threatened , the flaw appeared . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack me , I 'm a cripple . Consciously , of course , he was not aware of it . " I understand your objection , " Ellis said . " In the terms you present it , your argument is unanswerable . But I would like to consider the problem from a somewhat different viewpoint . It is perfectly true that Benson is disturbed , and that our operation probably wo n't change that . But what happens if we do n't operate on him ? Are we doing him a favor ? I do n't think so . We know that his seizures are lifethreatening  --  to himself , to others . His seizures have already gotten him into trouble with the law , and his seizures are getting worse . The operation will prevent seizures , and we think that is an important benefit to the patient . " High up , Manon gave a little shrug . Janet Ross knew the gesture ; it signaled irreconcilable differences , an impasse . " Well , then , " Ellis said , " are there other questions ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiping his forehead . " He did n't let up , did he ? " Janet Ross walked with him across the parking lot toward the Langer research building . It was late afternoon ; the sunlight was yellowing , turning pale and weak . " His point was valid , " she said mildly . Ellis sighed . " I keep forgetting you 're on his side . " " Why do you keep forgetting ? " she asked . She smiled as she said it . As the psychiatrist on the NPS staff , she 'd opposed Benson 's operation from the beginning . " Look , " Ellis said . " We do what we can . It 'd be great to cure him totally . But we ca n't do that . We can only help him . So we 'll help him . " She walked alongside him in silence . There was nothing to say . She had told Ellis her opinion many times before . The operation might not help  --  it might , in fact , make Benson much worse . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoring it . Or so it seemed to her . Actually , she liked Ellis , as much as she liked any surgeon . She regarded surgeons as flagrantly action-oriented , men ( they were almost always men , which she found significant ) desperate to do something , to take some physical action . In that sense , Ellis was better than most of them . He had wisely turned down several stage-three candidates before Benson , and she knew that was difficult Tuesday , March 9 , 1971 : Admission 27  | for him to do , because a part of him was terribly eager to perform the new operation . " I hate all this , " Ellis said . " Hate what ? " " The politics . That 's the nice thing about operating on monkeys . No politics at all . " " But you want to do Benson .... " " I 'm ready , " Ellis said . " We 're all ready . We have to take that first big step , and now is the time to take it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so uncertain ? " " Because I am , " she said . They came to the Langer building . Ellis went off to an early dinner with McPherson  --  a political dinner , he said irritably  --  and she took the elevator to the fourth floor . After ten years of steady expansion , the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit encompassed the entire fourth floor of the Langer research building . The other floors were painted a dead , cold white , but the NPS was bright with primary colors . The intention was to make patients feel optimistic and happy , but it always had the reverse effect on Ross . She found it falsely and artificially cheerful , like a nursery school for retarded children . She got off the elevator and looked at the reception area , one wall a bright blue , the other red . Like almost everything else about the NPS , the colors had been McPherson 's idea . It was strange , she thought , how much an organization reflected the personality of its leader . McPherson himself always seemed to have a bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly you had to be optimistic if you planned to operate on Harry Benson . The Unit was quiet now , most of the staff gone home for the night . She walked down the corridor past the colored 28 THE TERMINAL MAN  | doors with the stenciled labels : SONOENCEPHALOGRAPHY , CORTICAL FUNCTION , EEG , RAS SCORING , PARIETAL T , and , at the far end of the hall , TELECOMP . The work done behind those doors was as complex as the labels  --  and this was just the patient-care wing , what McPherson called " Applications . " Applications was ordinary compared to Development , the research wing with its chemitrodes and compsims and clad scenarios . To say nothing of the big projects , like George and Martha , or Form Q. Development was ten years ahead of Applications  --  and Applications was very , very advanced . A year ago , McPherson had asked her to take a group of newspaper science reporters through the NPS . He chose her , he said , " because she was such a piece of ass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shocking in a way . He was usually so courtly and fatherly . But her shock was minor compared to the shock the reporters felt . She had planned to show them both Applications and Development , but after the reporters had seen Applications they were so agitated , so clearly overloaded , that she cut the tour short . She worried a lot about it afterward . The reporters had n't been naive and they had n't been inexperienced . They were people who shuttled from one scientific arena to another all their lives . Yet they were rendered speechless by the implications of the work she had shown them . She herself had lost that insight , that perspective  --  she had been working in the NPS for three years , and she had gradually become accustomed to the things done there . The conj  --  action of men and machines , human brains and electronic brains , was no longer bizarre and provocative . It was just a way to take steps forward and get things done . On the other hand , she opposed the stage-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the start . She thought Benson was the wrong human subject , and she had just one last chance to prove it . At the end of the corridor , she paused by the door to Telecomp , listening to the quiet hiss of the print-out units . She heard voices inside , and opened the door . Telecomp was really the heart of the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit ; it was a large room , filled with electronic equipment . The walls and ceilings were soundproofed , a vestige of earlier days when the read-out consoles were clattering teletypes . Now they used either silent CRTs  --  cathode-ray tubes  --  or a print-out machine that sprayed the letters with a nozzle , rather than typed them mechanically . The hiss of the sprayer was the loudest sound in the room . McPherson had insisted on the change to quieter units because he felt the clattering disturbed patients who came to the NPS for treatment . Gerhard was there , and his assistant Richards . The wizard twins , they were called : Gerhard was only twentyfour , and Richards even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NPS ; both men regarded Telecomp as a kind of permanent playground filled with complex toys . They worked long but erratic hours , frequently beginning in the late afternoon , quitting at dawn . They rarely showed up for group conferences and formal meetings , much to McPherson 's annoyance . But they were undeniably good . Gerhard , who wore cowboy boots and dungarees and satiny shirts with pearl buttons , had gained some national attention at the age of thirteen when he built a twentyfoot solid-fuel rocket behind his house in Phoenix . The rocket possessed a remarkably sophisticated electronic guidance system and Gerhard felt he could fire it into orbit . His neighbors , who could see the nose of the finished 30 THE TERMINAL MAN  | rocket sticking up above the garage in the backyard , were disturbed enough to call the police , and ultimately the Army was notified . The Army examined Gerhard 's rocket and shipped it to White Sands for firing . As it happened , the second stage ignited before disengagement and the rocket exploded two miles up ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism and a number of scholarship offers from colleges and industrial firms . He turned them all down , let his uncle invest the patent royalties , and when he was old enough to drive , bought a Maserati . He went to work for Lockheed in Palmdale , California , but quit after a year because he was blocked from advancement by a lack of formal engineering degrees . It was also true that his colleagues resented a seventeen-year-old with a Maserati Ghibli and a propensity for working in the middle of the night ; it was felt he had no " team spirit . " Then McPherson hired him to work at the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit , designing electronic components to be synergistic with the human brain . McPherson , as head of the NPS , had interviewed dozens of candidates who thought the job was " a challenge " or " an interesting systems application context . " Gerhard said he thought it would be fun , and was hired immediately . Richards 's background was similar . He had finished high school and gone to college for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to be sent to Vietnam when he began to suggest improvements in the Army 's electronic scanning devices . The improvements worked , and Richards never got closer to combat than a laboratory in Santa Monica . When he was discharged , he also joined the NPS . The wizard twins : Ross smiled . " Hi , Jan , " Gerhard said . Tuesday , March 9 , 1971 : Admission 31  | " How 's it going , Jan ? " Richards said . They were both offhand . They were the only people on the staff who dared refer to McPherson as " Rog . " And McPherson put up with it . " Okay , " she said . " We 've got our stage three through grand rounds . I 'm going to see him now . " " We 're just finishing a check on the computer , " Gerhard said . " It looks fine . " He pointed to a table with a microscope surrounded by a tangle of electronic meters and dials . " Where is it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear plastic packet the size of a postage stamp lay under the microscope lens . Through the plastic she could see a dense jumble of micro-miniaturized electronic components . Forty contact points protruded from the plastic . With the help of the microscope , the twins were testing the points sequentially , using fine probes . " The logic circuits are the last to be checked , " Richards said . " And we have a backup unit , just in case . " Janet went over to the file-card storage shelves and began looking through the test cards . After a moment , she said , " Have n't you got any more psychodex cards ? " " They 're over here , " Gerhard said . " You want five-space or n-space ? " " N-space , " she said . Gerhard opened a drawer and took out a cardboard sheet . He also took out a flat plastic clipboard . Attached to the clipboard by a metal chain was a pointed metal probe , something like a pencil . " This is n't for the stage three , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But you 've run so many psychodexes on him before ? " 32 THE TERMINAL MAN  | " Just one more , for the records . " Gerhard handed her the card and clipboard . " Does your stage three know what 's going on ? " " He knows most of it , " she said . Gerhard shook his head . " He must be out of his mind . " " He is , " she said . " That 's the problem . " At the seventh floor , she stopped at the nurses ' station to ask for Benson 's chart . A new nurse was there , who said , " I 'm sorry but relatives are n't allowed to look at medical records . " " I 'm Dr. Ross . " The nurse was flustered . " I 'm sorry , Doctor , I did n't see a name tag . Your patient is in seven-oh-four . " " What patient ? " " Little Jerry Peters . " Dr. Ross looked blank . " Are n't you a pediatrician ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I 'm a psychiatrist at the NPS . " She heard the stridency in her own voice , and it upset her . But all those years growing up with people who said , " You do n't really want to be a doctor , you want to be a nurse , " or , " Well , for a woman , pediatrics is best , I mean , the most natural thing .... " " Oh , " the nurse said . " Then you want Mr. Benson in seven-ten . He 's been prepped . " " Thank you , " she said . She took the chart and walked down the hall to Benson 's room . She knocked on Benson 's door and heard gunshots . She opened the door and saw that the lights were dimmed , except for a small bedside lamp , but the room was bathed in an electric-blue glow from a TV . On the screen , a man was saying , " . . . dead Tuesday , March 9 , 1971 : Admission 33  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart . " " Hello ? " she said , and swung the door wider . Benson looked over . He smiled and pressed a button beside the bed , turning off the TV . His head was wrapped in a towel . " How are you feeling ? " she asked , coming into the room . She sat on a chair beside the bed . " Naked , " he said , and touched the towel . " It 's funny . You do n't realize how much hair you have until somebody cuts it all off . " He touched the towel again . " It must be worse for a woman . " Then he looked at her and became embarrassed . " It 's not much fun for anybody , " she said . " I guess not . " He lay back against the pillow . " After they did it , I looked in the wastebasket , and I was amazed . So much hair . And my head was cold . It was the funniest thing , a cold head . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at my head see what I looked like bald ? but they said it was n't a good idea . So I waited until after they left , and then I got out of bed and went into the bathroom . But when I got there ... " " Yes ? " " I did n't take the towel off . " He laughed . " I could n't do it . What does that mean ? " " I do n't know . What do you think it means ? " He laughed again . " Why is it that psychiatrists never give you a straight answer ? " He lit a cigarette and looked at her defiantly . " They told me I should n't smoke , but I 'm doing it anyway . " " I doubt that it matters , " she said . She was watching him closely . He seemed in good spirits , and she did n't want to take that away from him . But on the other hand , it 34 THE TERMINAL MAN  | was n't entirely appropriate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellis was here a few minutes ago , " he said , puffing on the cigarette . " He put some marks on me . Can you see ? " He lifted up the right side of his towel slightly , exposing white pale flesh over the skull . Two blue " X " marks were positioned behind the ear . " How do I look ? " he asked , grinning . " You look fine , " she said . " How do you feel ? " " Fine . I feel fine . " " Any worries ? " " No . I mean , what is there to worry about ? Nothing I can do . For the next few hours , I 'm in your hands , and Ellis 's hands .... " " I think most people would be a little worried before an operation . " " There you go again , being a reasonable psychiatrist . " He smiled , and then frowned . He bit his lip . " Of course I 'm worried . " " What worries you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cigarette . " Everything . I worry about how I 'll sleep . How I 'll feel tomorrow . How I 'll be when it 's all over . What if somebody makes a mistake ? What if I get turned into a vegetable ? What if it hurts ? What if I ... " " Die ? " " Sure . That , too . " " It 's really a minor procedure . It 's hardly more complicated than an appendectomy . " " I bet you tell that to all your brain-surgery patients . " " No , really . It 's a short , simple procedure . It 'll take about an hour and a half . " He nodded vaguely . She could n't tell if she had reassured  | him . " You know , " he said , " I do n't really think it will happen . I keep thinking tomorrow morning at the last minute they 'll come in and say , You 're cured , Benson , you can go home now . ' " " We hope you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinge of guilt saying that , but it came out smoothly enough . " You 're so goddamned reasonable , " he said . " There are times when I ca n't stand it . " " Like now ? " He touched the towel around his head again . " I mean , for Christ 's sake , they 're going to drill holes in my head , and stick wires in ? " " You 've known about that for a long time . " " Sure , " he said . " Sure . But this is the night before . " " Do you feel angry now ? " " No . Just scared . " " It 's all right to be scared , it 's perfectly normal . But do n't let it make you angry . " He stubbed out the cigarette , and lit another immediately . Changing the subject , he pointed to the clipboard she carried under her arm . " What 's that ? " " Another psychodex test . I want you to go through it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record . " IIe shrugged indifferently . He had taken the psychodex several times before . She handed him the clipboard and he arranged the question card on the board , then began to answer the questions . He read them aloud : " Would you rather be an elephant or a baboon ? Baboon . Elephants live too long . " With the metal probe , he punched out the chosen answer on the card . 36 THE TERMINAL MAN  | " If you were a color , would you rather be green or yellow ? Yellow . I 'm feeling very yellow right now . " He laughed , and punched the answer . She waited until he had done all thirty questions and punched his answers . He handed the clipboard back to her , and his mood seemed to shift again . " Are you going to be there ? Tomorrow ? " " Yes . " " Will I be awake enough to recognize you ? " " I imagine so . " " And when will I come out of it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's really a minor procedure , " she said again . He nodded . She asked him if she could get him anything , and he said some ginger ale , and she replied that he was NPO , nothing per ora , for twelve hours before the operation . She said he 'd be getting shots to help him sleep , and shots in the morning before he went to surgery . She said she hoped he 'd sleep well . As she left , she heard a hum as the television went back on , and a metallic voice said , " Look , Lieutenant , I 've got a murderer out there , somewhere in a city of three million people .... " She closed the door . Before leaving the floor , she put a brief note in the chart . She drew a red line around it , so that the nurses would be sure to see it : ADMITTING PSYCHIATRIC SUMMARY : This 34-year-old man has documented psychomotor epilepsy of 2 years ' duration . The etiology is presumably traumatic , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 9 , 1971 : Admission 37  | tried to kill two people , and has been involved in fights with several others . Any statement by him to hospital staff that he " feels funny " or " smells something bad " should be respected as indicating the start of a seizure . Under such circumstances , notify the NPS and Hospital Security at once . The patient has an accompanying personality disorder which is part of his disease . He is convinced that machines are conspiring to take over the world . These beliefs are strongly held and attempts to dissuade him from them will only draw his enmity and suspicion . One should also remember that he is a highly intelligent and sensitive man . The patient can be quite demanding at times , but he should be treated with firmness and respect . His intelligent and articulate manner may lead one to forget that his attitudes are not willful . He suffers from an organic disease which has affected his mental state . Beneath it all he is frightened and concerned about what is happening to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , " the PR man said . Ellis sighed . McPherson smiled patiently . " This is an organic cause of violent behavior , " he said . " That 's the way to look at it . " The three of them were sitting in the Four Kings Restaurant , adjacent to the hospital . The early dinner had been McPherson 's idea ; McPherson said he wanted Ellis present , so Ellis was present . That was how Ellis thought about it . Ellis raised his hand , beckoning the waiter for more coffee . As he did so , he thought it might keep him awake . 38 THE TERMINAL MAN  | But it did n't matter : he would n't sleep much tonight anyway . Not on the eve of his first stage three on a human subject . He knew he would toss and turn in bed , going over the operative procedure . Over and over again , reviewing the pattern he already knew so well . He 'd done a lot of monkeys as stage-three procedures . One hundred and fifty-four monkeys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out their stitches , they tugged at the wires , they screeched and fought you and bit you " Cognac ? " McPherson asked . " Fine , " the PR man said . McPherson glanced questioningly at Ellis . Ellis shook his head . He put cream in his coffee , and sat back suppressing a yawn . Actually , the PR man looked a little like a monkey . A juvenile rhesus : he had the same blocky lower jaw and the same bright-eyed alertness . The PR man 's name was Ralph . Ellis did n't know the last name . No PR man ever gave his last name . Of course , at the hospital he was n't referred to as a PR man ; he was the Hospital Information Officer or News Officer or some damned thing . He did look like a monkey . Ellis found himself staring at the area of the skull behind the ear , where the electrodes would be implanted . " We do n't know much about the causes of violence , " McPherson said . " And there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociologists and paid for by perfectly good taxpayer money . But we do know that one particular illness , psychomotor epilepsy , may lead to violence . " " Psychomotor epilepsy , " Ralph repeated . " Yes . Now , psychomotor epilepsy is as common as any other kind of epilepsy . There are some famous people who have had it , like Dostoevski . At the NPS , we think that Tuesday , March 9 , 1971 : Admission 39  | psychomotor epilepsy may be extremely common among those people who engage in repetitive violent acts  --  like certain policemen , gangsters , rioters , Hell 's Angels . Nobody ever thinks of these people as physically ill . We just accept the idea that there are a lot of men in the world with bad tempers . We think that 's normal . Perhaps it is n't . " " I see , " Ralph said . And he did , indeed , seem to be seeing . McPherson should have been a grade-school teacher , Ellis thought . His great gift was teaching . Certainly he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " McPherson said , brushing his hand through his white hair , " we have no idea exactly how common psychomotor epilepsy is . But our guess is that as much as one or two percent of the population may suffer from it . That 's two to four million Americans . " " Gosh , " Ralph said . Ellis sipped his coffee . Gosh , he thought . Good Christ . Gosh ... " For some reason , " McPherson said , nodding to the waiter as the cognacs were brought , " psychomotor epileptics are predisposed to violent , aggressive behavior during their attacks . We do n't know why , but it 's true . The other things that go along with the syndrome are hypersexuality and pathological intoxication . " Ralph began to look unusually interested . " We had the case of one woman with this disease , " McPherson said , " who during a seizure state would have intercourse with twelve men a night and still be unsatisfied . " Ralph swallowed his cognac . Ellis noticed that Ralph wore a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public-relations man gulping cognac at the thought of this woman . " Pathological intoxication refers to the phenomenon of 40 THE TERMINAL MAN  | excessive , violent drunkenness brought on by minuscule amounts of liquor  --  just a sip or two . That much liquor will unleash a seizure . " Ellis thought of his first stage three . Benson : pudgy little Benson , the mild-mannered computer programmer who got drunk and beat up people  --  men , women , whoever happened to be present . The very idea of curing that with wires stuck in the brain seemed absurd . Ralph seemed to think so , too . " And this operation will cure the violence ? " " Yes , " McPherson said . " We believe so . But the operation has never been done before on a human subject . It will be done at the hospital tomorrow morning . " " I see , " Ralph said , as if he suddenly understood the reason for the dinner . " It 's very sensitive , in terms of the press , " McPherson said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was a short pause . Finally , Ralph said , " Who 's going to do the operation ? " " I am , " Ellis said . " Well , " Ralph said , " I 'll have to check our files . I want to make sure I have a recent picture of you , and a good bio for the releases . " He frowned , thinking of the work ahead of him . Ellis was astonished at the man 's reaction . Was that all he thought ? That he might need a recent photo ? But McPherson took it smoothly in stride . " We 'll get you whatever you need , " he said , and the meeting broke up .  | Robert Morris was sitting in the hospital cafeteria finishing some stale apple pie when his pagemaster went off . It produced a high electronic squeal , which persisted until he reached down to his belt and turned it off . He returned to his pie . After a few moments , the squeal came again . He swore , put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer his page . There had been a time when he regarded the little gray box clipped to his belt as a wonderful thing . He relished those moments when he would be having lunch or dinner with a girl and his pagemaster would go off , requiring him to call in . That sound demonstrated that he was a busy , responsible person involved in life-and-death matters . When the pagemaster went off , he would excuse himself abruptly and answer the call , radiating a sense of duty before pleasure . The girls loved it . But after several years it was no longer wonderful . The box was inhuman and implacable , and it had come to symbolize for him the fact that he was not his own man . He was perpetually on call to some higher authority , however whimsical  --  a nurse who wanted to confirm a medication order at 2 a.m. ; a relative who was acting up , making trouble about Mama 's post-operative treatment ; a call to tell him a conference was being held when he was already there attending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were those when he went home and put the box away for a few hours . He 42 THE TERMINAL MAN  | became unreachable and free . And he liked that very much . He stared across the cafeteria at the remainder of his apple pie as he dialed the switchboard . " Dr. Morris . " " Dr. Morris , two-four-seven-one . " " Thank you . " That was the extension for the seventh floor nurses ' station . It was odd how he had learned all these extensions . The telephone network of University Hospital was more complicated than human anatomy . But over the years , without any conscious attempt to learn it , he came to know it quite well . He dialed the floor . " Dr. Morris . " " Oh , yes , " a female voice said . " We have a woman with an overnight bag for patient Harold Benson . She says it 's personal things . Is it all right to give it to him ? " " I 'll come up , " he said . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray , picked it up , and carried it to the disposal area . As he did so , his beeper went off again . He went to answer it . " Dr. Morris . " " Dr. Morris , one-three-five-seven . " That was the metabolic unit . He dialed . " Dr. Morris . " " This is Dr. Hanley , " an unfamiliar voice said . " We wondered if you could take a look at a lady we think may have steroid psychosis . She 's a hemolytic anemic up for splenectomy . " " I ca n't see her today , " Morris said , " and tomorrow is tight . " That , he thought , was the understatement of the year . " Have you tried Peters ? " " No ... " " Peters has a lot of experience with steroid mentation . Try him . " " All right . Thanks . " Tuesday , March 9 , 1971 : Admission 43  | Morris hung up . He got onto the elevator and pressed the button for the seventh floor . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch ; it was 6:30 and he was supposedly off-duty by now . But he answered it anyway . It was Kelso , the pediatric resident . " Want your ass whipped ? " Kelso said . " Okay . What time ? " " Say , about half an hour ? " " If you 've got the balls . " " I 've got them . They 're in my car . " " See you on the court , " Morris said . Then he added , " I may be a little late . " " Do n't be too late , " Kelso said . " It 'll be dark soon . " Morris said he would hurry , and hung up . The seventh floor was quiet . Most of the other hospital floors were noisy , jammed with relatives and visitors at this hour , but the seventh floor was always quiet . It had a sedate , calm quality that the nurses were careful to preserve . The nurse at the station said , " There she is , Doctor , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over to her . She was young and very pretty in a flashy , show-business sort of way . She had long legs . " I 'm Dr. Morris . " " Angela Black . " She stood up and shook hands , very formally . " I brought this for Harry . " She lifted a small blue overnight bag . " He asked me to bring it . " " All right . " He took the bag from her . " I 'll see that he gets it . " She hesitated , then said , " Can I see him ? " " I do n't think it 's a good idea . " Benson would have been 44 THE TERMINAL MAN  | shaved by nom , ; pre-op patients who had been shaved often did n't want to see people . " Just for a few minutes ? " " He 's heavily sedated , " he said . She was clearly disappointed . " Then would you give him a message ? " " Sure . " " Tell him I 'm back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . " " You wo n't forget ? " " No . I 'll tell him . " " Thank you . " She smiled . It was a rather nice smile , despite the long false eyelashes and the heavy make-up . Why did young girls do that to their faces ? " I guess I 'll be going now . " And she walked off , short skirt and very long legs , a briskly determined walk . He watched her go , then hefted the bag , which seemed heavy . The cop sitting outside the door to 710 said , " How 's it going ? " " Fine , " Morris said . The cop glanced at the overnight bag but said nothing as Morris took it inside the room . Harry Benson was watching a Western on television . Morris turned down the sound . " A very pretty girl brought you this . " " Angela ? " Benson smiled . " Yes , she has a nice exterior . Not a very complicated internal mechanism , but a nice exterior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag . " Did she bring everything ? " Morris watched as Benson opened it , placing the contents on the bed . There were a pair of pajamas , an electric razor , some after-shave lotion , a paperback novel . Tuesday , March 9 , 1971 : Admission 45  | Then Benson brought out a black wig . " What 's that ? " Morris asked . Benson shrugged . " I knew I 'd need it sooner or later , " he said . Then he laughed . " You are letting me out of here , are n't you ? Sooner or later ? " Morris laughed with him . Benson dropped the wig back into the bag , and removed a plastic packet . With a metallic clink , he unfolded it , and Morris saw it was a set of screwdrivers of various sizes , stored in a plastic package with pockets for each size . " What 's that for ? " Morris asked . Benson looked puzzled for a moment . Then he said , " I do n't know if you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them with me . For protection . " Benson placed the screwdrivers back into the overnighter . He handled them carefully , almost reverently . Morris knew that patients frequently brought odd things into the hospital , particularly if they were seriously ill . There was a kind of totemic feeling about these objects , as if they might have magical preservative powers . They were often connected with some hobby or favorite activity . He remembered a yachtsman with a metastatic brain tumor who had brought a kit to repair sails , and a woman with advanced heart disease who had brought a can of tennis balls . That kind of thing . " I understand , " Morris said . Benson smiled .  | Telecomp was empty when she came into the room ; the consoles and teleprinters stood silently , the screens blinking up random sequences of numbers . She went to the corner and poured herself a cup of coffee , then fed the test card from Benson 's latest psychodex into the computer . The NPS had developed the psychodex test , along with several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what McPherson called " double-edged thinking . " In this case , he meant that the idea of a brain being like a computer worked two ways , in two different directions . On the one hand , you could utilize the computer to probe the brain , to help you analyze its workings . At the same time , you could use your increased knowledge of the brain to help design better and more efficient computers . As McPherson said , " The brain is as much a model for the computer as the computer is a model for the brain . " At the NPS , computer scientists and neurobiologists had worked together for several years . From that association had come Form Q , and programs like George and Martha , and new psychosurgical techniques , and psychodex . Psychodex was relatively simple . It was a test that took straightforward answers to psychological questions and manipulated the answers according to complex mathematical formulations . As the data were fed into the computer , Ross watched the screen glow with row after row of calculations . Tuesday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; the numbers , she knew , were just the computer 's scratch pad , the intermediate steps that it went through before arriving at a final answer . She smiled , thinking of how Gerhard would explain it  --  rotation of thirty by thirty matrices in space , deriving factors , making them orthogonal , then weighting them . It all sounded complicated and scientific , and she did n't really understand any of it . She had discovered long ago that you could use a computer without understanding how it worked . Just as you could use an automobile , a vacuum cleaner  --  or your own brain . The screen flashed " CALCULATIONS ENDED . CALL DISPLAY SEQUENCE . " She punched in the display sequence for three-space scoring . The computer informed her that three spaces accounted for eighty-one percent of variance . On the screen she saw a three-dimensional image of a mountain with a sharp peak . She stared at it a moment , then picked up the telephone and paged McPherson . McPherson frowned at the screen . Ellis looked over his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perfectly , " McPherson said . " When was it done ? " " Today , " she said . McPherson sighed . " You 're not going to quit without a battle , are you ? " Instead of answering , she punched buttons and called up a second mountain peak , much lower . " Here 's the last one previously . " " On this scoring , the elevation is ? " " Psychotic mentation , " she said . Tuesday , March 9 , 1971 : Admission 49  | " So he 's much more pronounced now , " McPherson said . " Much more than even a month ago . " " Yes , " she said . " You think he was screwing around with the test ? " She shook her head . She punched in the four previous tests , in succession . The trend was clear : on each test the mountain peak got higher and sharper . " Well , then , " McPherson said , " he 's definitely getting worse . I gather you still think we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " He 's unquestionably psychotic , and if you start putting wires in his head ? " " I know , " McPherson said . " I know what you 're saying . " ? he 's going to feel that he 's been turned into a machine , " she said . McPherson turned to Ellis . " Do you suppose we can knock this elevation down with thorazine ? " Thorazine was a major tranquilizer . With some psychotics , it helped them to think more clearly . " I think it 's worth a try . " McPherson nodded . " I do , too . Janet ? " She stared at the screen and did n't reply . It was odd how these tests worked . The mountain peaks were an abstraction , a mathematical representation of an emotional state . They were n't a real characteristic of a person , like fingers or toes , or height or weight . " Janet ? What do you think ? " McPherson repeated . " I think , " she said , " that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you still disapprove ? " " I do n't disapprove . ' I think it 's unwise for Benson . " " What do you think about using thorazine ? " McPherson persisted . " It 's a gamble . " " A gamble not worth taking . " 50 THE TERMINAL MAN  | " Maybe it 's worth it , and maybe it 's not . But it 's a gamble . " McPherson nodded and turned to Ellis . " Do you still want to do him ? " " Yes , " Ellis said , staring at the screen . " I still want to do him . " As always , Morris found it strange to play tennis on the hospital court . The hospital buildings looming high above him always made him feel slightly guilty  --  all those rows of windows , all those patients who could not do what he was doing . Then there was the sound . Or , rather , the absence of sound . The freeway ran near the hospital , and the reassuring thwock ! of the tennis balls was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . It was getting dark now , and he was having trouble with his vision ; the ball seemed to pop unexpectedly into his court . Kelso was much less hampered . Morris often joked that Kelso ate too many carrots , but whatever the explanation , it was humiliating to play late with Kelso . Darkness helped him . And Morris hated to lose . He had long ago become comfortable with the fact of his own competitiveness . Morris never stopped competing . He competed in games , he competed in work , he competed with women . More than once Ross had pointed that out to him , and then dropped the subject in the sly way that psyTuesday , March 9 , 1971 : Admission 51  | chiatrists raise a point , then drop it . Morris did n't mind . It was a fact of his life , and whatever the connotations ? deep insecurity , a need to prove himself , a feeling of inferiority  --  he did n't worry about it . He drew pleasure from competition and satisfaction from winning . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more often than not . In part , he had joined the NPS because the challenges were very great and because the potential rewards were enormous . Privately , Morris expected to be a professor of surgery before he was forty . His past career had been outstanding  --  that was why Ellis had accepted him  --  and he was equally confident about his future . It would n't hurt to be associated with a major landmark in surgical practice . All in all , he was in a good mood , and he played hard for half an hour , until he was tired and it was too dark to see . He signaled to Kelso  --  no point in calling above the freeway sounds  --  to end the game . They met at the net and shook hands . Morris was reassured to see that Kelso was sweating heavily . " Good game , " Kelso said . " Tomorrow , same time ? " " I 'm not sure , " Morris said . Kelso paused . " Oh , " he said . " That 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big day , " Morris nodded . Christ , had the news even reached the pediatric residents ? For a moment he felt what Ellis must be feeling  --  the intense pressure , abstract , vague , that came from knowing that the entire University Hospital staff was watching this procedure . " Well , good luck with it , " Kelso said . As the two men walked back to the hospital , Morris saw Ellis , a distant solitary figure , limping slightly as he crossed the parking lot and climbed into his car , and drove home .  | At 6 a.m . Janet Ross was on the third surgical floor , dressed in greens , having coffee and a doughnut . The surgeons ' lounge was busy at this hour . Although operations were scheduled to begin at six , most did n't get going for fifteen or twenty minutes after that . The surgeons sat around , reading the newspaper , discussing the stock market and their golf games . From time to time one of them would leave , go to the overhead viewing galleries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparations were coming . She was the only woman in the room , and her presence changed the masculine atmosphere subtly . It annoyed her that she should be the only woman , and it annoyed her that the men should become quieter , more polite , less jovial and raucous . She did n't give a damn if they were raucous , and she resented being made to feel like an intruder . It seemed to her that she had been an intruder all her life , even when she was very young . Her father had been a surgeon who never bothered to conceal his disappointment and irritation that he had a daughter instead of a son . A son would have fitted into his scheme of life ; he could have brought him to the hospital on Saturday mornings , taken him into the operating rooms  --  those were all things you could do with a son . But a daughter was something else , a perplexing entity not suited for a surgical life . And therefore an intrusion .. . She looked around at all the surgeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , to cover her unease , she went to the phone and dialed the seventh floor . " This is Dr. Ross . Is Mr. Benson on call ? " " He was just sent . " " When did he leave the floor ? " " About five minutes ago . " She hung up and went back to her coffee . Ellis appeared and waved to her across the room . " There 'll be a five-minute delay hooking into the computer , " he said . " They 're tying in the lines now . Is the patient on call ? " " Sent five minutes ago . " " You seen Morris ? " " Not yet . " " He better get his ass down here , " Ellis said . Somehow that made her feel good . Morris was in the elevator with a nurse and Benson , who lay on a stretcher , and one of the cops . As they rode down , Morris said to the cop , " You ca n't get off on the floor . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor directly . " " What should I do ? " ' The cop was intimidated . He 'd been docile and hesitant all morning . The routine of surgery left him feeling a helpless outsider . " You can watch from the viewing gallery on the third floor . Tell the desk nurse I said it was all right . " The cop nodded . The elevator stopped at the second floor . The doors opened to reveal a hallway with people , all in surgical greens , walking back and forth . A large sign read STERILE AREA . NO ADMITTANCE WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION . The lettering was red . Morris and the nurse wheeled Benson out of the eleWednesday , March 10 , 1971 : Implantation 57  | vator . The cop remained behind , looking nervous . He pushed the button for the third floor , and the doors closed . Morris went with Benson down the corridor . After a moment , Benson said , " I 'm still awake . " " Of course you are . " " But I do n't want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-op medications half an hour earlier . They would be taking effect soon , making him drowsy . " How 's your mouth ? " " Dry . " That was the atropine beginning to work . " You 'll be okay . " Morris himself had never had an operation . He 'd performed hundreds , but never experienced one himself . In recent years , he had begun to wonder how it felt to be on the other side of things . He suspected , though he would never admit it , that it must be awful . " You 'll be okay , " he said to Benson again , and touched his shoulder . Benson just stared at him as he was wheeled down the corridor to OR 9 . OR 9 was the largest operating room in the hospital . It was nearly thirty feet square and packed with electronic equipment . When the full surgical team was there ? all twelve of them  --  things got pretty crowded . But now just two scrub nurses were working in the cavernous graytiled space . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OR 9 had no operating table . Instead , there was a softly cushioned upright chair , like a dentist 's chair . Janet Ross watched the girls through the windows in the door that separated the scrub room from the operating room . Along58 THE TERMINAL MAN  | side her , Ellis finished his scrub and muttered something about Morris being ' late . Ellis got profane before operations . He also got very nervous , though he seemed to think nobody noticed that . Ross had scrubbed with him on several animal procedures and had seen the ritual  --  tension and profanity before the operation , and utter bland calmness once things were under way . Ellis turned off the faucets with his elbows and entered the OR , backing in so that his arms did not touch the door . A nurse handed him a towel . While he dried his hands , he looked back through the door at Ross , and then up at the glass-walled viewing gallery overhead . Ross knew there would be a crowd in the gallery watching the operation . Morris came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered where you were . " " Tour guide for the patient , " he said . One of the circulating nurses entered the scrub room and said , " Dr. Ross , there 's somebody here from the radiation lab with a unit for Dr. Ellis . Does he want it now ? " " If it 's loaded , " she said . " I 'll ask , " the nurse said . She disappeared , and stuck her head in a moment later . " He says it 's loaded and ready to go , but unless your equipment is shielded it could give you trouble . " Ross knew that all the OR equipment had been shielded the week before . The plutonium exchanger did n't put out much radiation  --  not enough to fog an X-ray plate  --  but it could confuse more delicate scientific equipment . There was , of course , no danger to people . " We 're shielded , " Ross said . " Have him take it into the OR . " Ross turned to Morris , scrubbing alongside her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday , March 10 , 1971 : Implantation 59  | " He should be , " she said . Morris glanced at her , his eyes questioning above the gauze surgical mask . She shook her hands free of excess water and backed into the OR . The first thing she saw was the rad-lab man wheeling in the tray with the charging unit on it . It was contained in a small lead box . On the sides were stenciled DANGER RADIATION and the triple-blade orange symbol for radiation . It was all faintly ridiculous ; the charging unit was quite safe . Ellis stood across the room , being helped into his gown . He plunged his hands into his rubber gloves and flexed his fingers . To the rad-lab man he said , " Has it been steri-lized ? " " Sir ? " " Has the unit been sterilized ? " " I do n't know , sir . " " Then give it to one of the girls and have her autoclave it . It 's got to be sterile . " Dr. Ross dried her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like most surgeons , Ellis preferred a cold room  --  too cold , really , for the patient . But as Ellis often said , " If I 'm happy , the patient 's happy . " Ellis was now across the room standing by the viewing box , while the circulating nurse , who was not scrubbed , put up the patient 's X-rays . Ellis peered closely at them , though he had seen them a dozen times before . They were perfectly normal skull films . Air had been injected into the ventricles , so that the horns stood out darkly . One by one the rest of the team filtered into the room . All together , there were two scrub nurses , two circulating nurses , one orderly , Ellis , two assistant surgeons including Morris , two electronics technicians , and a computer programmer . The anaesthetist was outside with Benson . Without looking up from his console , one of the electronics men said , " Any time you want to begin , Doctor . " 60 THE TERMINAL MAN  | " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there were some chuckles from the Nine Group team . Ross looked around the room at the seven TV screens . They were of different sizes and stationed in different places , depending on how important they were to the surgeon . The smallest screen monitored the closed-circuit taping of the operation . At the moment , it showed an overhead view of the empty chair . Another screen , nearer the surgeon , monitored the electroencephalogram , or EEG . It was turned off now , the sixteen pens tracing straight white lines across the screen . There was also a large TV screen for basic operative parameters : electrocardiogram , peripheral arterial pressure , respirations , cardiac output , central venous pressure , rectal temperature . Like the EEG screen , it was also tracing a series of straight lines . Another pair of screens were completely blank . They would display black-and-white image-intensified X-ray views during the operation . Finally , two color screens displayed the LIMBIC Program output . That program was cycling now , without punchedin coordinates . On the screens , a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , generated by computer , flashed below . As always , Ross felt that the computer was another , almost human presence in the room  --  an impression that was always heightened as the operation proceeded . Ellis finished looking at the X-rays and glanced up at the clock . It was 6:19 ; Benson was still outside being checked by the anaesthetist . Ellis walked around the room , talking briefly to everyone . He was being unusually friendly , and Ross wondered why . She looked up at the viewing gallery and saw the director of the hospital , the chief of surgery , Wednesday , March 10 , 1971 : Implantation 61  | the chief of medicine , and the chief of research all looking down through the glass . Then she understood . It was 6:21 when Benson was wheeled in . He was now heavily pre-medicated , relaxed , his body limp , his eyelids heavy . His head was wrapped in a green towel . Ellis supervised Benson 's transfer from the stretcher to the chair . As the leather straps were placed across his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes opening wide . " That 's just so you do n't fall off , " Ellis said easily . " We do n't want you to hurt yourself . " " Uh-huh , " Benson said softly , and closed his eyes again . Ellis nodded to the nurses , who removed the sterile towel from Benson 's head . The naked head seemed very small that was Ross 's usual reaction  --  and white . The skin was smooth , except for a razor nick on the left frontal . Ellis 's blue-ink " X " marks were clearly visible on the right side . Benson leaned back in the chair . He did not open his eyes again . One of the technicians began to fix the monitor leads to his body , strapping them on with little dabs of electrolyte paste . They were attached quickly ; soon his body was connected to a tangle of multicolored wires running off to the equipment . Ellis looked at the TV monitor screens . The EEG was now tracing sixteen jagged lines ; heartbeat was recorded ; respirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The technicians began to punch pre-op parameters into the computer . Normal lab values had already been fed in . During the operation , the computer would monitor all vital signs at five-second intervals , and would signal if anything went wrong . 62 THE TERMINAL MAN  | " Let 's have music , please , " Ellis said , and one of the nurses slipped a tape cartridge into the portable cassette recorder in a corner of the room . A Bach concerto began to play softly . Ellis always operated to Bach ; he said he hoped that the precision , if not the genius , might be contagious . They were approaching the start of the operation . The digital wall clock said 6:29:14 a.m . Next to it , an elapsedtime digital clock still read 0 : 00 : 00 . With the help of a scrub nurse , Ross put on her sterile gown and gloves . The gloves were always difficult for her . She did n't scrub in frequently , and when she plunged her fingers into the gloves she caught her hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another . It was impossible to read the scrub nurse 's reaction ; only her eyes were visible above the mask . But Ross was glad that Ellis and the other surgeons were turned away attending to the patient . She stepped to the back of the room , being careful not to trip over the thick black power cables that snaked across the floor in all directions . Ross did not participate in the initial stages of the operation . She waited until the stereotaxic mechanism was in place and the coordinates were determined . She had time to stand to one side and pluck at her glove until all the fingers were in the right slots . There was no real purpose for her to attend the operation at all , but McPherson was insistent that one member of the non-surgical staff scrub in each day that they operated . He felt it kept the Unit more cohesive . At least that was what he said . She watched Ellis and his assistants across the room draping Benson ; then she looked over to the draping as seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded on video tape for later review . Wednesday , March 10 , 1971 : Implantation 63  | " I think we can start now , " Ellis said easily . " Go ahead with the needle . " The anaesthetist , working behind the chair , placed the needle between the second and third lumbar spaces of Benson 's spine . Benson moved once and made a slight sound , and then the anaesthetist said , " I 'm through the dura . How much do you want ? " The computer console flashed " OPERATION BEGUN . " The computer automatically started the elapsed-time clock , which ticked off the seconds . " Give me thirty cc 's to begin , " Ellis said . " Let 's have Xray , please . " The X-ray machines were swung into position at the front and side of the patient 's head . Film plates were set on , locking in with a click . Ellis stepped on the floor button , and the TV screens glowed suddenly , showing black-andwhite images of the skull . He watched in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horns in black . The programmer sat at the computer console , his hands fluttering over the buttons . On his TV display screen , the words " PNEUMOGRAPH INITIATED " appeared . " All right , let 's fix his hat , " Ellis said . The boxlike tubular stereotactic frame was placed over the patient 's head . Burr-hole locations were fixed and checked . When Ellis was satisfied , he injected local anaesthetic into the scalp points . Then he cut the skin and reflected it back , exposing the white surface of the skull . " Drill , please . " With the 2-mm drill , he made the first of the two holes on the right side of the skull . He placed the stereotactic frame  --  the " hat " ? over the head , and screwed it down securely . Ross looked over at the computer display . Values for heart rate and blood pressure flashed on the screen and 64 THE TERMINAL MAN  | faded ; everything was normal . Soon the computer , like the surgeons , would begin to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check , " Ellis said , stepping away from the patient , frowning critically at Benson 's shaved head and the metal frame screwed on top of it . The X-ray technician came forward and snapped the pictures . In the old days , Ross remembered , they actually took X-ray plates and determined position by visual inspection of the plates . It was a slow process . Using a compass , protractor , and ruler , they drew lines across the X-ray , measured them , rechecked them . Now the data were fed directly to the computer , which did the analysis more rapidly and more accurately . All the team turned to look at the computer print-out screen . The X-ray views appeared briefly , and were replaced by schematic drawings . The maxfield location of the stereotactic apparatus was calculated ; the actual location was then merged with it . A set of coordinates flashed up , followed by the notation " PLACEMENT CORRECT . " Ellis nodded . " Thank you for your consultation , " he said humorlessly , and went over to the tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Briggs stainless-steel Tefloncoated electrode arrays . In the past , they had tried almost everything else : gold , platinum alloy , and even flexible steel strands in the days when the electrodes were placed by inspection . The old inspection operations were bloody , messy affairs . It was necessary to remove a large portion of the skull and expose the surface of the brain . The surgeon found his landmark points on the surface itself , and then placed his electrodes in the substance of the brain . If he had to place them in deep structures , he would occasionWednesday , March 10 , 1971 : Implantation 65  | ally cut through the brain to the ventricles with a knife , and then place them . There were serious complications ; the operations were lengthy ; the patients never did very well . Now the computer had changed all that . The computer allowed you to fix a point precisely in three-dimensional space . Initially , along with other researchers in the field , the NPS group had tried to relate deep brain points to skull architecture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , from the meatus of the ear , from the sagittal suture . That , of course , did n't work  --  people 's brains did not fit inside their skulls with any consistency . The only way to determine deep brain points was in relation to other brain points  --  and the logical landmarks were the ventricles , the fluid-filled spaces within the brain . According to the new system , everything was determined in relation to the ventricles . With the help of the computer , it was no longer necessary to expose the brain surface . Instead , a few small holes were drilled in the skull and the electrodes inserted , while the computer watched by X-ray to make sure they were being placed correctly . Ellis picked up the first electrode array . From where Ross stood , it looked like a single slender wire . Actually , it was a bundle of twenty wires , with staggered contact points . Each wire was coated with Teflon except for the last millimeter , which was exposed . Each wire was a different length , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like a miniature staircase . Ellis checked the array under a large glass . He called for more light and turned the array , peering at all contact points . Then he had a scrub nurse plug it into a testing unit and test every contact . This had been done dozens of times before , but Ellis always checked again before inser-  | tion . And he always had four arrays sterilized , though he would need only two . Ellis was careful . At length he was satisfied . " Are we ready to wire ? " he asked the team . They nodded . He stepped up to the patient and said , " Let 's go through the dura . " Up to this point in the operation , they had drilled through the skull , but had left intact the membrane of dura mater which covered the brain and enclosed the spinal fluid . Ellis 's assistant used a probe to puncture the dura . " I have fluid , " he said , and a thin trickle of clear liquid slid down the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponged it away . Ross always found it a source of wonder the way the brain was protected . Other vital body organs were wellprotected , of course : the lungs and heart inside the bony cage of the ribs , the liver and spleen under the edge of the ribs , the kidneys packed in fat and secure against thick muscles of the lower back . Good protection , but nothing compared to the central nervous system , which was encased entirely in thick bone . Yet even this was not enough ; inside the bone there were sac-like membranes which held cerebrospinal fluid . The fluid was under pressure , so that the brain sat in the middle of a pressurized liquid system that afforded it superb protection . McPherson had compared it to a fetus in a water-filled womb . " The baby comes out of the womb , " McPherson said , " but the brain never comes out of its own special womb . " " We will place now , " Ellis said . Ross moved forward , joining the surgical team gathered around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electrode array into the burr hole and then pressed slightly , entering the substance of the brain . The technician Wednesday , March 10 , 1971 : Implantation 67  | punched buttons on the computer console . The display screen read : " ENTRY POINT LOCALIZED . " The patient did not move , made no sound . The brain could not feel pain ; it lacked pain sensors . It was one of the freaks of evolution that the organ which sensed pain throughout the body could feel nothing itself . Ross looked away from Ellis toward the X-ray screens . There , in harsh black and white , she saw the crisply outlined white electrode array begin its slow , steady movement into the brain . She looked from the anterior view to the lateral , and then to the computer-generated images . The computer was interpreting the X-ray images by drawing a simplified brain , with the temporal-lobe target area in red and a flickering blue track showing the line the electrode must traverse from entry point to the target area . So far , Ellis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross said . The computer flashed up triple coordinates in rapid succession as the electrodes went deeper . " Practice makes perfect , " Ellis said sourly . He was now using the scale-down apparatus attached to the stereotactic hat . The scaler reduced his crude finger movements to very small changes in electrode movements . If he moved his finger half an inch , the scaler converted that to half a millimeter . Very slowly the electrodes penetrated deeper into the brain . From the screens , Ross could lift her eyes and watch the closed-circuit TV monitor showing Ellis at work . It was easier to watch on TV than to turn around and see the real thing . But she turned around when she heard Benson say , very distinctly , " Uh . " Ellis stopped . " What was that ? " " Patient , " the anaesthetist said , gesturing toward Benson . 68 THE TERMINAL MAN  | Ellis paused , , bent over , to look at Benson 's face . " You all right , Mr. Benson ? " He spoke loudly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His voice was deeply drugged . " Any pain ? " " No . " " Good . Just relax now . " And he returned to his work . Ross sighed in relief . Somehow , all that had made her tense , even though she knew there was no reason for alarm . Benson could feel no pain , and she had known all along that his sedation was only that  --  a kind of deep , drugged semi-sleep , and not unconsciousness . There was no reason for him to be unconscious , no reason to risk general anaesthesia . She turned back to the computer screen . The computer had now presented an inverted view of the brain , as seen from below , near the neck . The electrode track was visible end on , as a single blue point surrounded by concentric circles . Ellis was supposed to keep within one millimeter , one twenty-fifth of an inch , of the assigned track . He deviated half a millimeter. " 50 TRACK ERROR , " warned the computer . Ross said , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its path . Ellis glanced up at the screens . " Too high on beta plane ? " " Wide on gamma . " " Okay . " After a moment , the electrodes continued along the path . " 40 TRACK ERROR , " the computer flashed . It rotated its brain image slowly , bringing up an anterolateral view . " 20 TRACK ERROR , " it said . " You 're correcting nicely , " Ross said . Ellis hummed along with the Bach and nodded . " ZERO TRACK ERROR , " the computer indicated , and swung the brain view around to a full lateral . The second Wednesday , March 10 , 1971 : Implantation 69  | screen showed a full frontal view . After a few moments , the screen blinked " APPROACHING TARGET . " Ross conveyed the message . Seconds later , the flashing word " STRIKE . " " You 're on , " Ross said . Ellis stepped back and folded his hands across his chest . " Let 's have a coordinate check , " he said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . The programmer flicked the console buttons rapidly . On the TV screens , the placement of the electrode was simulated by the computer . The simulation ended , like the actual placement , with the word " STRIKE . " " Now match it , " Ellis said . The computer held its simulation on one screen and matched it to the X-ray image of the patient . The overlap was perfect ; the computer reported " MATCHED WITHIN ESTABLISHED LIMITS . " " That 's it , " Ellis said . He screwed on the little plastic button cap which held the electrodes tightly against the skull . Then he applied dental cement to fix it . He untangled the twenty fine wire leads that came off the electrode array and pushed them to one side . " We can do the next one now , " he said . At the end of the second placement , a thin , arcing cut was made with a knife along the scalp . To avoid important superficial vessels and nerves , the cut ran from the electrode entry points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neck . There it deviated to the right shoulder . Using blunt dissection , Ellis opened a small pocket beneath the skin of the right lateral chest , near the armpit . " Have we got the charging unit ? " he asked .  | The charger was brought to him . It was smaller than a pack of cigarettes , and contained thirty-seven grams of the radioactive isotope plutonium-238 oxide . The radiation produced heat , which was converted directly by a thermionic unit to electric power . A Kenbeck solid-state DC/DC circuit transformed the output to the necessary voltage . Ellis plugged the charger into the test pack and did a last-minute check of its power before implantation . As he held it in his hand , he said , " It 's cold . I ca n't get used to that . " Ross knew layers of vacuum-foil insulation kept the exterior cool and that inside the packet the radiation capsule was producing heat at 500 degrees Fahrenheit  --  hot enough to cook a roast . He checked radiation to be sure there would be no leakage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a certain amount of leakage , naturally , but it was no more than that produced by a commercial color television set . Finally he called for the dog tag . Benson would have to wear this dog tag for as long as he had the atomic charging unit in his body . The tag warned that the person had an atomic pacemaker , and gave a telephone number . Ross knew that the number was a listing which played a recorded message twenty-four hours a day . The recording gave detailed technical information about the charging unit , and warned that bullet wounds , automobile accidents , fires , and other damage could release the plutonium , which was a powerful alpha-particle emitter . It gave special instructions to physicians , coroners , and morticians , and warned particularly against cremation of the body , unless the charger was first removed . Ellis inserted the charging unit into the small subdermal pocket he had made in the chest wall . He sewed tissue layers around it to fix it in place . Then he turned his atten72 THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross looked up at the viewing gallery and saw the wizard twins , Gerhard and Richards , watching intently . Ellis checked the packet under the magnifying glass , then gave it to a scrubbed technician , who hooked the little computer into the main hospital computer . To Ross , the computer was the most remarkable part of the entire system . Since she had joined the NPS three years before , she had seen the computer shrink from a prototype as large as a briefcase to the present tiny model , which looked small in the palm of a hand yet contained all the elements of the original bulky unit . This tiny size made subdermal implantation possible . The patient was free to move about , take showers , do anything he wanted . Much better than the old units , where the charger was clipped to a patient 's belt and wires dangled down all over . She looked at the computer screens which flashed " OPERATIVE MONITORS INTERRUPTED FOR ELECTRONICS CHECK . " On one screen , a blown-up circuit diagram appeared . The computer checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second for each check ; the entire process was completed in two seconds . The computer flashed " ELECTRONIC CHECK NEGATIVE . " A moment later , brain views reappeared . The computer had gone back to monitoring the operation . " Well , " Ellis said , " let 's hook him up . " He painstakingly attached the forty fine wire leads from the two electrode arrays to the plastic unit . Then he fitted the wires down along the neck , tucked the plastic under the skin , and called for sutures . The elapsed-time clock read one hour and twelve minutes .  | Morris wheeled Benson into the recovery room , a long , low-ceilinged room where patients were brought immediately after operation . The NPS had a special section of the rec room , as did cardiac patients and burns patients . But the NPS section , with its cluster of electronic equipment , had never been used before . Benson was the first case . Benson looked pale but otherwise fine ; his head and neck were heavily bandaged . Morris supervised his transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , Ellis was telephoning in his operative note . If you dialed extension 1104 , you got a transcribing machine .

Post-op condition : good As he finished the note , he heard Ross say to the nurse , " Start him on phenobarb as soon as he 's awake . " She sounded angry . He looked up at her . " Something the matter ? " " No , " she said . " You seem angry . " " Are you picking a fight with me ? " " No , " he said , " of course ? " " Just make sure he gets his phenobarb . We want to keep him sedated until we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Morris watched her go , then glanced over at Ellis , who was still dictating but had been watching . Ellis shrugged . " What 's the matter with her ? " the nurse asked . " Probably just tired , " Morris said . He adjusted the monitoring equipment on the shelf above Benson 's head . He turned it on and waited until it warmed up . Then he placed the temporary induction unit around Benson 's taped shoulder . During the operation , all the wires had been hooked up , Wednesday , March 10 , 1971 : Implantation 75  | but they were not working now . Before that happened , Benson had to be " interfaced . " This meant determining which of the forty electrodes would stop an epileptic seizure , and locking in the appropriate switches on the subdermal computer . Because the computer was under the skin , the locking in would be accomplished by an induction unit , which worked through the skin . But the interfacing could n't be done until tomorrow . Meanwhile , the equipment monitored Benson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright green , and showed the white tracing of his EEG . The pattern was normal for alpha rhythms slowing from sedation . Benson opened his eyes and looked at Morris . " How do you feel ? " he asked . " Sleepy , " he said . " Is it beginning soon ? " " It 's over , " Morris said . Benson nodded , not at all surprised , and closed his eyes . A rad-lab technician came in and checked for leakage from the plutonium with a Geiger counter . There was none . Morris slipped the dog tag around Benson 's neck . The nurse picked it up curiously , read it , and frowned . Ellis came over . " Time for breakfast ? " " Yes , " Morris said . " Time for breakfast . " They left the room together . The trouble was he did n't really like the sound of his voice . His voice was rough and grating , and his enunciation was poor . McPherson preferred to see the words in his mind , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAN  | the microphone button on the dictation machine . " Roman numeral three . Philosophical Implications . " III . Philosophical Implications . He paused and looked around his office . The large model of the brain sat at the corner of his desk . Shelves of journals along one wall . And the TV monitor . On the screen now he was watching the playback of the morning 's operation . The sound was turned off , the milky images silent . Ellis was drilling holes in Benson 's head . McPherson watched and began to dictate . This procedure represents the first direct link between a human brain and a computer . The link is permanent . Now of course , any man sitting at a computer console and interacting with the computer by pressing buttons can be said to be linked . Too stuffy , he thought . He ran the tape back and made changes . Now , a man sitting at a computer console and interacting with the computer by pressing buttons is linked to the computer . But that link is not direct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operative procedure represents something rather different . How is one to think about it ? A good question , he thought . He stared at the TV image of the operation , then continued . One might think of the computer in this case as a prosthetic device . Just as a man who has his arm amputated can receive a mechanical equivalent of the lost arm , so a brain-damaged man can receive a mechanical aid to overcome the effects of brain damage . This is a comfortable way to think about the operation . It makes the computer into a high-class wooden leg . Yet the implications go much further than that . He paused to look at the screen . Somebody at the main tape station had changed reels . He was no longer seeing Wednesday , March 10 , 1971 : Implantation 77  | the operation , but a psychiatric interview with Benson before the surgery . Benson was excited , smoking a cigarette , making stabbing gestures with the lighted tip as he spoke . Curious , McPherson turned the sound up slightly . " .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere . They used to be the servants of man , but now they 're taking over . Subtly , subtly taking over . " Ellis stuck his head into the office , saw the TV screen , and smiled . " Looking at the before ' pictures ? " " Trying to get a little work done , " McPherson said , and pointed to the dictation machine . Ellis nodded , ducked out , closing the door behind him . Benson was saying , " . . . know I 'm a traitor to the human race , because I 'm helping to make machines more intelligent . That 's my job , programming artificial intelligence , and ? " McPherson turned the sound down until it was almost inaudible . Then he went back to his dictation . In thinking about computer hardware , we distinguish between central and peripheral equipment . That is , the main computer is considered central even though , in human terms , it may be located in some out-of-the-way place ? like the basement of a building , for example . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , are peripheral . They are located at the edges of the computer system , on different floors of the building . He looked at the TV screen . Benson was particularly excited . He turned up the sound and heard , " . . . getting more intelligent . First steam engines , then automobiles , and airplanes , then adding machines . Now computers , feedback loops ? " McPherson turned the sound off . For the human brain , the analogy is a central brain and peripheral terminals , such as mouth , arms , and legs . They  | carry out the instructions  --  the output  --  of the brain . By and large , we judge the workings of the brain by the activity of these peripheral functions . We notice what a person says , and how he acts , and from that deduce how his brain works . This idea is familiar to everyone . He looked at Benson on the TV screen . What would Benson say ? Would he agree or disagree ? But then did it matter ? Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with not one brain but two . He has his biological brain , which is damaged , and he has a new computer brain , which is designed to correct the damage . This new brain is intended to control the biological brain . Therefore a new situation arises . The patient 's biological brain is the peripheral terminal  --  the only peripheral terminal for the new computer . In one area , the new computer brain has total control . And therefore the patient 's biological brain , and indeed his whole body , has become a terminal for the new computer . We have created a man who is one single , large , complex computer terminal . The patient is a readout device for the new computer , and he is as helpless to control the read-out as a TV screen is helpless to control the information presented on it . Perhaps that was a bit strong , he thought . He pressed the button and said , " Harriet , type that last paragraph but I want to look at it , okay ? Roman numeral four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conclusions . He paused again , and turned up the sound on Benson . Benson was saying , " . . . hate them , particularly the prostitutes . Airplane mechanics , dancers , translators , gas-station attendants , the people who are machines , or who service machines . The prostitutes . I hate them all . " As he spoke , Benson continued to stab with his cigarette .  | " And how did you feel ? " Dr. Ramos said . " Angry , " Janet Ross said . " Angry as hell . I mean , that nurse was standing there , watching it all . She pretended she did n't understand what was happening , but she did . " " You felt angry about ... " Dr. Ramos let his voice trail off . " About the operation . About Benson . They went ahead and did it . I told them from the beginning  --  from the goddamned very beginning  --  that it was a bad idea , but Ellis and Morris and McPherson all wanted to do it . They 're so cocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery room , gloating over Benson  --  who was all taped up and pale as a ghost  --  I just got mad . " " Why is that ? " " Because he was so pale , because he , uh ? " She stopped . She fumbled for an answer , but could n't think of a logical response . " I gather the operation was successful , " Dr. Ramos said . " And most people are pale after surgery . What got you mad ? " She said nothing . Finally , she said , " I do n't know . " She heard Dr. Ramos shift in his chair . She could not see him ; she was lying on the couch , and Dr. Ramos was behind her head . There was a long silence while she stared at the ceiling and tried to think what to say . Her thoughts seemed to be churning , not making any sense . Finally Dr. Ramos said , " The presence of the nurse seems important to you . "  | " It does ? " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware I had . " " You said the nurse was there and knew what was going on .... What , exactly , was going on ? " " I was mad . " " But you do n't know why ? ... " " Yes , I do , " she said . " It was Morris . He 's so cocky . " " Cocky , " Dr. Ramos repeated . " Overly self-assured . " " You said cocky . " " Look , I did n't mean anything by that ; it was just a word ? " She broke off . She was very angry . She could hear it in her voice . " You are angry now , " Dr. Ramos said . " Very . " " Why ? " After a long pause , she said , " They did n't listen to me . " " Who did n't listen to you ? " " Any of them . Not McPherson , not Ellis , not Morris . Nobody listened to me . " " Did you tell Dr. Ellis or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But you vented your anger on Dr. Morris . " " Yes . " He was leading her someplace and she could n't see where . Normally at this point she could jump ahead and understand . But this time " How old is Dr. Morris ? " " I do n't know . About my age . Thirty , thirty-one  --  something in there . " " About your age . " That pissed her off , his way of repeating things . " Yes , God damn it , about my age . " Wednesday , March 10 , 1971 : Implantation 81  | " And a surgeon . " " Yes .... " " Is it easier to express anger toward someone you regard as a contemporary ? " " I never thought about it . " " Your father was also a surgeon , but he was n't your contemporary . " " You do n't have to draw me a picture , " she said . " You 're still angry . " She sighed . " Let 's change the subject . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy voice that she sometimes liked , and sometimes hated . Morris hated to do Initial Interviews . The Initial Interview staff consisted mostly of clinical psychologists ; the work was lengthy and boring . A recent tabulation had shown that only one in forty new patients to the NPS received further work ; and only one in eighty-three was accepted as having some variety of organic brain disease with behavioral manifestations . That meant most Initial Interviews were a waste of time . And it was particularly true of off-the-street patients . A year ago McPherson had decided , for political reasons , that anyone who heard of the NPS and presented himself directly would be seen . Most patients were still referrals , of course , but McPherson felt the image of the Unit depended upon prompt treatment of self-referrals as well . McPherson also felt that everyone on the staff should  | do some Initial Interviews from time to time . Morris worked two days a month in the little interview rooms with the one-way glass mirrors . This was one of his days , but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the morning 's operation , and he resented returning to this kind of mundane routine . He looked up unhappily as the next patient came into the room . He was a young man in his twenties , wearing dungarees and a sweatshirt . He had long hair . Morris stood to greet him . " I 'm Dr. Morris . " " Craig Beckerman . " The handshake was soft and tentative . " Please sit down . " He waved Beckerman to a chair which faced Morris 's desk , and the one-way mirror behind . " What brings you to us ? " " I , uh . . . I 'm curious . I read about you , " Beckerman said , " in a magazine . You do brain surgery here . " " That 's true . " " Well , I , uh ... I was curious about it . " " In what sense ? " " Well , this magazine article ? Can I smoke here ? " " Of course , " Morris said . He pushed an ashtray across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Camels , tapped one on the desk , then lit it . " The magazine article ... " " Right . The magazine article said that you put wires in the brain . Is that true ? " " Yes , we sometimes perform that kind of surgery . " Beckerman nodded . He smoked the cigarette . " Yeah , well , is it true that you can put wires in so that you feel pleasure ? Intense pleasure ? " " Yes , " Morris said . He tried to say it blandly . Wednesday , March 10 , 1971 : Implantation 83  | " That 's really true ? " " It 's really true , " Morris said . And then he shook his pen , indicating that it was out of ink . He opened the desk drawer to take out another pen , and as he reached into the drawer , he pressed a sequence on the buttons hidden inside . Immediately his telephone rang . " Dr. Morris . " At the other end , the secretary said , " You rang ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , and transfer them to Development section ? " " Right away , " the secretary said . " Thank you . " Morris hung up . He knew that the Development people would arrive soon , to watch on the other side of the one-way mirror . " I 'm sorry for the interruption . You were saying ... " " About the wires in the brain . " " Yes . We do that operation , Mr. Beckerman , under special circumstances , but it 's still pretty experimental . " " That 's all right , " Beckerman said . He puffed on his cigarette . " That 's fine with me . " " If you want information , we can arrange for you to have some reprints and magazine tear sheets explaining our work here . " Beckerman smiled and shook his head . " No , no , " he said . " I do n't want information . I want the operation . I 'm volunteering . " Morris pretended to be surprised . He paused a moment and said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the article it said that one jolt of electricity was like a dozen orgasms . It sounded really terrific . " " And you want this operation performed on you ? " " Yeah , " Beckerman said , nodding vigorously . " Right . "  | " Why ? " " Are you kidding ? Would n't everybody want it ? Pleasure like that ? " " Perhaps , " Morris said , " but you 're the first person to ask for it . " " What 's the matter ? " Beckerman said . " Is it really expensive or something ? " " No . But we do n't perform brain surgery for trivial reasons . " " Oh , wow , " Beckerman said . " So that 's where you are . Jesus . " And he got up and left the room , shaking his head . The three Development guys looked stupefied . They sat in the adjoining room and stared through the one-way glass . Beckerman had long since departed . " Fascinating , " Morris said . The Development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat and said , " To say the least . " Morris knew what was going through their heads . For years , they had been doing feasibility studies , potential application studies , ramification studies , industrial operations studies , input-output studies . They were geared to think in the future  --  and now they were suddenly confronted with the present . " That man is an clad , " one of them said . And sighed . The clad concept had caused a lot of interest and some detached academic concern . The notion of an electrical addict  --  a man who needed his jolts of electricity just a ' some men needed doses of drugs  --  had seemed almost fancifully speculative . But now they had a patient who was clearly a potential addict . Wednesday , March 10 , 1971 : Implantation 85  | " Electricity is the biggest kick of all , " one of them said , and laughed . But the laugh was nervous , edged with tension . Morris wondered what McPherson would say . Probably something philosophical . McPherson was mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical addict was predicated on an astonishing discovery made by James Olds in the 1950s . Olds found that there were areas in the brain where electrical stimulation produced intense pleasure  --  strips of brain tissue he called " rivers of reward . " If an electrode was placed in such an area , a rat would press a selfstimulation lever to receive a shock as often as five thousand times an hour . In its quest for pleasure , it would ignore food and water . It would stop pressing the lever only when it was prostrate with exhaustion . This remarkable experiment had been repeated with goldfish , guinea pigs , dolphins , cats , and goats . There was no longer any question that the pleasure terminals in the brain were a universal phenomenon . They had also been located in humans . Out of these considerations had come the notion of the electrical addict , the man who needed pleasurable shocks . At first glance , it seemed impossible for a person to become an addict . But it actually was n't . For instance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . One could envision clever Japanese firms manufacturing electrodes for as little as two or three dollars and exporting them . Nor was the idea of an illegal operation so far-fetched . At one time a million American women underwent illegal abortions each year . The implantation brain surgery was somewhat more complex , but not forbiddingly so . And the  | surgical techniques would become more standardized in the future . It was easy to imagine clinics springing up in Mexico and the Bahamas . Nor was there a problem finding surgeons to do the job . A single busy , well-organized neurosurgeon could perform ten or fifteen operations a day . He could certainly charge a thousand dollars for each and with that kind of incentive , unscrupulous surgeons could be found . A hundred thousand dollars a week in cash was a strong inducement to break the law  --  if indeed a law were ever passed . That did not seem very likely . A year before , the hospital had organized a seminar with legal scholars on " Biomedical Technology and the Law . " Elads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not responsive . The clad concept did not fit neatly into the already existing pattern of laws governing drug addiction . All those laws recognized that a person could become a drug addict innocently or involuntarily  --  quite a different proposition from a person coldly seeking a surgical procedure that would make him an addict . Most of the lawyers felt that the public would not seek such an operation ; there would be no legal problem because there would be no public demand . Now Beckerman had provided evidence for such a demand . " I 'll be goddamned , " another of the Development people said . Morris found that comment hardly adequate . He himself felt something he had felt once or twice before since joining the NPS . It was the sensation that things were moving too fast , without enough caution and control , and that it could all get out of control , suddenly , and without warning .  | At 6 p.m. , Roger McPherson , head of the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit , went up to the seventh floor to check on his patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benson as his patient . A proprietary feeling , but not entirely incorrect . Without McPherson , there would be no NPS , and without an NPS , there would be no surgery , no Benson . That was how he thought of it . Room 710 was quiet and bathed in reddish light from the setting sun . Benson appeared to be asleep , but his eyes opened when McPherson closed the door . " How are you feeling ? " McPherson asked , moving close to the bed . Benson smiled . " Everyone wants to know that , " he said . McPherson smiled back . " It 's a natural question . " " I 'm tired , that 's all . Very tired . . . . Sometimes I think I 'm a ticking time bomb , and you 're wondering when I 'll explode . " " Is that what you think ? " McPherson asked . Automatically , he adjusted Benson 's covers so he could look at the I.V . line . It was flowing nicely . " Ticktick , " Benson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McPherson frowned . He was accustomed to mechanical metaphors from Benson  --  the man was preoccupied , after all , with the idea of men as machines . But to have them appear so soon after operation . . . " Any pain ? " 88 THE TERMINAL MAN  | " None . A little ache behind my ears , like I 'd fallen . That 's all . " That , McPherson knew , was the bone pain from the drilling . " Fallen ? " " I 'm a fallen man , " Benson said . " I 've succumbed . " " To what ? " " To the process of being turned into a machine . " He opened his eyes and smiled again . " Or a time bomb . " " Any smells ? Strange sensations ? " As he asked , McPherson looked at the EEG scanner above the bed . It was still reading normal alpha patterns , without any suggestion of seizure activity . " No . Nothing like that . " " But you feel as if you might explode ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . " Sort of , " Benson said . " In the coming war , we may all explode . " " How do you mean ? " " You look annoyed , " Benson said . " I 'm not , just puzzled . How do you mean , in the coming war ? " " In the coming war between men and machines . The human brain is obsolete , you see . " That was a new thought . McPherson had n't heard it from Benson before . He stared at him , lying in the bed , his head and shoulders heavily bandaged . It made the upper part of his body and his head appear thick , gross , oversized . " Yes , " Benson said . " The human brain has gone as far as it is going to go . It 's exhausted , so it spawned the next generation of intelligent forms . They will ? Why am I so tired ? " He closed his eyes again . " You 're exhausted from the operation . " Wednesday , March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure , " he said , and smiled with his eyes closed . A moment later he was snoring . McPherson remained by the bed for a moment , then turned to the window and watched the sun set over the Pacific . Benson had a nice room ; you could see a bit of the ocean between the high-rise apartments in Santa Monica . He remained there for several minutes . Benson did not wake . Finally , McPherson went out to the nurses ' station to write his note in the chart . " Patient alert , responsive , oriented times three . " He paused after writing that . He did n't really know if Benson was oriented to person , place , and time ; he had n't checked specifically . But he was clear and responsive , and McPherson let it go . " Flow of ideas orderly and clear , but patient retains machine imagery of pre-operative state . It is too early to be certain , but it appears that early predictions were correct that the operation would not alter his mentation between seizures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He stared at it for a moment , then closed the chart and replaced it on the shelf . It was a good note , cool , direct , holding out no false anticipations . The chart was a legal document , after all , and it could be called into court . McPherson did n't expect to see Benson 's chart in court , but you could n't be too careful . He believed very strongly in appearances  --  and he felt it was his job to do so . The head of any large scientific laboratory performed a political function . You might deny it ; you might dislike it . But it was nonetheless true , a necessary part of the job . You had to keep all the people in the lab happy as they worked together . The more prima donnas you had , the tougher the job was , as pure politics .  | You had to get your lab funded from outside sources , and that was also pure politics . Particularly if you were working in a delicate area , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of grant applications . It was simple enough : when you applied for money , you announced that the money would be spent to find the enzyme horseradish peroxidase , which could lead to a cure for cancer . You would easily get sixty thousand dollars for that project  --  although you could n't get sixty cents for mind control . He looked at the row of charts on the shelf , a row of unfamiliar names , into which BENSON , H. F. 7I0 merged indistinguishably . In one sense , he thought , Benson was correct he was a walking time bomb . A man treated with mind-control technology was subject to all sorts of irrational public prejudice . " Heart control " in the form of cardiac pacemakers was considered a wonderful invention ; " kidney control " through drugs was a blessing . But " mind control " was evil , a disaster  --  even though the NPS control work was directly analogous to control work with other organs . Even the technology was similar : the atomic pacemaker they were using had been developed first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benson thought of himself as a ticking time bomb . McPherson sighed , took out the chart again , and flipped to the section containing doctors ' orders . Both Ellis and Morris had written post-op care orders . McPherson added : " After interfacing tomorrow a.m. , begin thorazine . " He looked at the note , then decided the nurses would n't understand interfacing . He scratched it out and wrote : " After noon tomorrow , begin thorazine . " As he left the floor , he thought that he would rest more Wednesday , March 10 , 1971 : Implantation 91  | easily once Benson was on thorazine . Perhaps they could n't defuse the time bomb  --  but they could certainly drop it into a bucket of cold water . Late at night , in Telecomp , Gerhard stared anxiously at the computer console . He typed in more instructions , then walked to a print-out typewriter and began reviewing the long sheaf of green-striped sheets . He scanned them quickly , looking for the error he knew was there in the programmed instructions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers for nearly ten years  --  different computers , different places and he had never seen one make a mistake . Of course , mistakes occurred all the time , but they were always in the program , not in the machine . Sometimes that infallibility was hard to accept . For one thing , it did n't fit with one 's view of the rest of the world , where machines were always making mistakes  --  fuses blowing , stereos breaking down , ovens overheating , cars refusing to start . Modern man expected machines to make their fair share of errors . But computers were different , and working with them could be a humiliating experience . They were never wrong . It was as simple as that . Even when it took weeks to find the source of some problem , even when the program was checked a dozen times by as many different people , even when the whole staff was slowly coming to the conclusion  | that for once , the computer circuitry had fouled up  --  it always turned out , in the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Richards came in , shrugging off a sport coat , and poured himself a cup of coffee . " How 's it going ? " Gerhard shook his head . " I 'm having trouble with George . " " Again ? Shit . " Richards looked at the console . " How 's Martha ? " " Martha 's fine , I think . It 's just George . " " Which George is it ? " " Saint George , " Gerhard said . " Really a bitch . " Richards sipped his coffee and sat down at the console . " Mind if I try it ? " " Sure , " Gerhard said . Richards began flicking buttons . He called up the program for Saint George . Then he called up the program for Martha . Then he pushed the interaction button . Richards and Gerhard had n't devised these programs ; they were modified from several existing computer programs developed at other universities . But the basic idea was the same  --  to create a computer program that would make the computer act emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs with names like George and Martha . There was a precedent for that : Eliza in Boston , and Aldous in England . George and Martha were essentially the same program with slight differences . The original George was programmed to be neutral in his response to stimuli . Then Martha was created . Martha was a little bitchy ; Martha disliked most things . Finally , another George was formulated , a very loving George , who was referred to as Saint George . Each program could respond with three emotional states Wednesday , March 10 , 1971 : Implantation 93  | ? love , fear , and anger . Each could produce three actions ? approach , withdrawal , and attack . All this was , of course , highly abstract . It was carried out in terms of numbers . For example , the original George was neutral to most numbers , but he disliked the number 751 . He was programmed to dislike it . And by extension he disliked similar numbers-743 , 772 , and so on . He much preferred numbers such as 404 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these numbers , George responded with numbers signifying love and approach . If you punched in 707 , George withdrew . If you punched in 750 , George angrily attacked  --  according to the numbers he printed out . The NPS staff had played with the programs in this way for a long time . Then they had incorporated program modifications to allow for " talk " from the computer . The numbers were translated into sentences . This was amusing , and revealing . The actual interaction was referred to as " the Christmas game " because most of it was conducted as giving and receiving gifts objects that had an assigned or learned emotional value , just as the numbers did . Normal George interacting with Martha would eventually win her over , and her bitchiness would recede into the background . But Saint George had a much worse effect on her . His loving acceptance drove her up the wall . That is , if things were working normally . Richards watched as the print-out flashed across the screen . HELLO I 'M SAINT GEORGE HELLO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAY MUCH , MARTHA . NO BUT I LIKE YOU .  | WHY I DO N'T LIKE YOU . I UNDERSTAND THAT . HOW CAN I HELP ? " It is n't printing periods consistently , " Richards said . " When did that start ? " " That 's nothing , " Gerhard said . " Just keep watching . " HELP ? YES , I WOULD LIKE TO HELP YOU . HAVE A CAT . Richards winced . Cats were programmed to be something that both George and Martha disliked . Giving George a cat was a very hostile move . THANK YOU HAVE ANOTHER CAT . THANK YOU YOU ARE VERY KIND . HAVE ANOTHER CAT . NO THANK YOU . DO N'T YOU LIKE CATS ? YES BUT I HAVE ENOUGH CATS . HAVE A GORILLA . " Really nasty , " Richards said . " What are the other interactions like ? " " Pretty much the same , " Gerhard said . " As bad as this ? " " Pretty much . " They were accustomed now to the idea that when the computers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interaction could be guessed , but the specific results were uncertain . It was like a computer playing checkers  --  it was probably going to win , but it would win a different way each time , depending on what the opponent did . Wednesday , March 10 , 1971 : Implantation 95  | I DO N'T WANT A GORILLA . DO N'T YOU LIKE GORILLAS ? NO THANK YOU . YOU ARE TOO POLITE . I AM SORRY IF I OFFEND YOU IN ANY WAY . YOU TALK TOO MUCH . I AM SORRY . HAVE AN EGGPLANT . Richards watched with interest . Saint George had no background for eggplants . But he disliked cucumbers and bananas . NO THANK YOU . DO N'T YOU LIKE EGGPLANT ? NOT VERY MUCH . HERE HAVE ANOTHER ONE . NO THANK YOU . I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT . NO THANK YOU . GO ON AND TAKE IT . NO THANK YOU . I INSIST . NO THANK YOU . " What 's happened to Saint George ?

" He 's not a saint any more . " THEN HAVE BOTH A BANANA AND A CUCUMBER . NO THANK YOU . I INSIST . GO TO HELL I WILL KILL YOU : : : : : : : : : : . The screen was filled with white dots . " What does that mean , unprintable response ? " Richards said . " I do n't know . I 've never seen it before tonight . " " How many times has this program been run ? " Richards asked . " One hundred and ten , against Martha . " " Any learning erasures ? " " No . " " I 'll be goddamned , " Richards said . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We can write this one up . " Gerhard nodded and went back to the print-out . In theory , what was happening was not puzzling . Both George and Martha were programmed to learn from experience . Like the checkers-playing programs  --  where the machine got better each time it played a game  --  this program was established so that the machine would " learn " new responses to things . After one hundred and ten sets of experience , Saint George had abruptly stopped being a saint . He was learning not to be a saint around Martha  --  even though he had been programmed for saintliness . " I know just how he feels , " Richards said , and switched the machine off . Then he joined Gerhard , looking for the programming error that had made it all possible .  | Janet Ross sat in the empty room and glanced at the wall clock . It was 9 a.m . She looked down at the desk in front of her , which was bare except for a vase of flowers and a notepad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud , she said , " How 're we doing ? " There was a mechanical click and Gerhard 's voice came through the speaker mounted in the ceiling . " We need a few minutes for the sound levels . The light is okay . You want to talk a minute ? " She nodded , and glanced over her shoulder at the oneway mirror behind her . She saw only her reflection , but she knew Gerhard , with his equipment , was behind , watching her . " You sound tired , " she said . " Trouble with Saint George last night , " Gerhard said . " I 'm tired , too , " she said . " I was having trouble with somebody who is n't a saint . " She laughed . She was just talking so they could get a sound level for the room ; she had n't really paid attention to what she was saying . But it was true : Arthur was no saint . He was also no great discovery , though she 'd thought he might be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been , in fact , a little infatuated with him . ( " Infatuated ? Hmm ? Is that what you 'd call it ? " She could hear Dr. Ramos now . ) Arthur had been born handsome and wealthy . He had a yellow Ferrari , a lot of dash , and a lot of charm . She was able to feel feminine and frivolous around him . He did madcap , dashing things like flying her to Mexico City for dinner because  | he knew a little restaurant where they made the best tacos in the world . She knew it was all silly , but she enjoyed it . And in a way she was relieved  --  she never had to talk about medicine , or the hospital , or psychiatry . Arthur was n't interested in any of those things ; he was interested in her as a woman . ( " Not as a sex object ? " Damn Dr. Ramos . ) Then , as she got to know him better , she found herself wanting to talk about her work . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to hear about it . Arthur was threatened by her work ; he had problems about achievement . He was nominally a stockbroker  --  an easy thing for a rich man 's son to be  --  and he talked with authority about money , investments , interest rates , bond issues . But there was an aggressive quality in his manner , a defensiveness , as if he were substantiating himself . And then she realized what she should have known from the beginning , that Arthur was chiefly interested in her because she was substantial . It was  --  in theory  --  more difficult to impress her , to sweep her off her feet , than it was to impress the little actresses who hung out at Bumbles and the Candy Store . And therefore more satisfying . Finally her role had begun to bother her , and she no longer drew pleasure from being frivolous around him , and everything became vaguely depressing . She recognized all the signs : her work at the hospital became busier , and she had to break dates with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flamboyance , his restless impulsiveness , his clothes , and his cars . She would look at him across the dinner table and try to find what she had once seen . She could not find even a trace of it . Last night she had broken it off . They both knew it was coming . Why did it depress her ? A Thursday , March 11 , 1971 : Interfacing 101  | " You stopped talking , " Gerhard said . " I do n't know what to say ... Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the patient . The quick brown fox jumped over the pithed frog . We are all headed for that final common pathway in the sky . " She paused . " Is that enough ? " " A little more . " " Mary , Mary , quite contrary , how does your garden grow ? I 'm sorry I do n't remember the rest . How does the poem go ? " She laughed . " That 's fine , we have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Will you be interfacing at the end of the series ? " " Probably , " Gerhard said , " if it goes well . Rog is in a hurry to get him onto tranquilizers . " She nodded . This was the final stage in Benson 's treatment , and it had to be done before tranquilizers could be administered . Benson had been kept on sedation with phenobarbital until midnight the night before . He would be clearheaded this morning , and ready for interfacing . It was McPherson who had coined the term " interfacing . " McPherson liked computer terminology . An interface was the boundary between two systems . Or between a computer and an effector mechanism . In Benson 's case , it was almost a boundary between two computers  --  his brain and the little computer wired into his shoulder . The wires had been attached , but the switches had n't been thrown yet . Once they were , the feedback loop of Benson-computerBenson would be instituted . McPherson saw this case as the first of many . He planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind patients . The charts were all there on his office wall . And he planned to use more and  | more sophisticated computers in the link-up . Eventually , he would get to projects like Form Q , which seemed farfetched even to Ross . But today the practical question was which of the forty electrodes would prevent an attack . Nobody knew that yet . It would be determined experimentally . During the operation , the electrodes had been located precisely , within millimeters of the target area . That was good surgical placement , but considering the density of the brain it was grossly inadequate . A nerve cell in the brain was just a micron in diameter . There were a thousand nerve cells in the space of a millimeter . From that standpoint , the electrodes had been crudely positioned . And this crudeness meant that many electrodes were required . One could assume that if you placed several electrodes in the correct general area , at least one of them would be in the precise position to abort an attack . Trialand-error stimulation would determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gerhard said over the loudspeaker . A moment later , Benson arrived in a wheelchair , wearing his blue-and-white striped bathrobe . He seemed alert as he waved to her stiffly  --  the shoulder bandages inhibited movement of his arm . " How are you feeling ? " he said , and smiled . " I 'm supposed to ask you . " " I 'll ask the questions around here , " he said . He was still smiling , but there was an edge to his voice . With some surprise , she realized that he was afraid . And then she wondered why that surprised her . Of course he would be afraid . Anyone would be . She was n't exactly calm herself . The nurse patted Benson on the shoulder , nodded to Dr. Ross , and left the room . They were alone . Thursday , March 11 , 1971 : Interfacing 103  | For a moment , neither spoke . Benson stared at her ; she stared back . She wanted to give Gerhard time to focus the TV camera in the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we doing today ? " Benson asked . " We 're going to stimulate your electrodes , sequentially , to see what happens . " He nodded . He seemed to take this calmly , but she had learned not to trust his calm . After a moment he said , " Will it hurt ? " " No . " " Okay , " he said . " Go ahead . " Gerhard , sitting on a high stool in the adjacent room , surrounded in the darkness by glowing green dials of equipment , watched through the one-way glass as Ross and Benson began to talk . Alongside him , Richards picked up the tape-recorder microphone and said quietly , " Stimulation series one , patient Harold Benson , March 11 , 1971 . " Gerhard looked at the four TV screens in front of him . One showed the closed-circuit view of Benson that would be stored on video tape as the stimulation series proceeded . Another displayed a computer-generated view of the forty electrode points , lined up in two parallel rows within the brain substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowed on the screen . A third TV screen ran an oscilloscope tracing of the shock pulse as it was delivered . And a fourth showed a wiring diagram of the tiny computer in Benson 's neck . It also glowed as stimulations traveled through the circuit pathways.  | In the next room , Ross was saying , " You 'll feel a variety of sensations , and some of them may be quite pleasant . We want you to tell us what you feel . All right ? " Benson nodded . Richards said , " Electrode one , five millivolts , for five seconds . " Gerhard pressed the buttons . The computer diagram showed a tracing of the circuit being closed , the current snaking its way through the intricate electronic maze of Benson 's shoulder computer . They watched Benson through the one-way glass . Benson said , " That 's interesting . " " What 's interesting ? " Ross asked . " That feeling . " " Can you describe it ? " " Well , it 's like eating a ham sandwich . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not particularly . " " Do you feel hungry ? " " Not particularly . " " Do you feel anything else ? " " No . Just the taste of a ham sandwich . " He smiled . " On rye . " Gerhard , sitting at the control panel , nodded . The first electrode had stimulated a vague memory trace . Richards : " Electrode two , five millivolts , five seconds . " Benson said , " I have to go to the bathroom . " Ross said , " It will pass . " Gerhard sat back from the control panel , sipped a cup of coffee , and watched the interview progress . " Electrode three , five millivolts , five seconds . " This one produced absolutely no effect on Benson . Benson was quietly talking with Ross about bathrooms in restaurants , hotels , airports " Try it again , " Gerhard said . " Up five . " Thursday , March 11 , 1971 : Interfacing 105  | " Repeat electrode three , ten millivolts , five seconds , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrode three . There was still no effect . " Go on to four , " Gerhard said . He wrote out a few notes : #1 ? ? memory trace ( ham sand. ) #2 ? bladder fullness #3 ? no subjective change #4 He drew the dash and waited . It was going to take a long time to go through all forty electrodes , but it was fascinating to watch . They produced such strikingly different effects , yet each electrode was very close to the next . It was the ultimate proof of the density of the brain , which had once been described as the most complex structure in the known universe . And it was certainly true : there were three times as many cells packed into a single human brain as there were human beings on the face of the earth . That density was hard to comprehend , sometimes . Early in his NP$ career , Gerhard had requested a human brain to dissect . He had done it over a period of several days , with a dozen neuroanatomy texts opened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissection , a blunt wooden stick , to scrape away the cheesy gray material . He had patiently , carefully scraped away  --  and in the end , he had nothing . The brain was not like the liver or the lungs . To the naked eye , it was uniform and boring , giving no indication of its true function . The brain was top subtle , too complex . Too dense . " Electrode four , " Richards said into the recorder . " Five millivolts , five seconds . " The shock was delivered . And Benson , in an oddly childlike voice , said , " Could I have some milk and cookies , please ? " " That 's interesting , " Gerhard said , watching the reaction .  | Richards nodded . " How old would you say ? " " About five or six , at most . " Benson was talking about cookies , talking about his tricycle , to Ross . Slowly , over the next few minutes , he seemed to emerge like a time-traveler advancing through the years . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth , instead of actually being there . " I always wanted the cookies , and she would never give them to me . She said they were bad for me and would give me cavities . " " We can go on , " Gerhard said . Richards said , " Electrode five , five millivolts , five seconds . " In the next room , Benson shifted uncomfortably in his wheelchair . Ross asked him if something was wrong . Benson said , " It feels funny . " " How do you mean ? " " I ca n't describe it . It 's like sandpaper . Irritating . " Gerhard nodded , and wrote in his notes , " #5 ? potential attack electrode . " This happened sometimes . Occasionally an electrode would be found to stimulate a seizure . Nobody knew why  --  and Gerhard personally thought that nobody ever would . The brain was , he believed , beyond comprehension . His work with programs like George and Martha had led him to understand that relatively simple computer instructions could produce complex and unpredictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine could exceed the capabilities of the programmer ; that was clearly demonstrated in 1963 when Arthur Samuel at IBM programmed a machine to play checkers  --  and the machine eventually became so good that it beat Samuel himself . Yet all this was done with computers which had no more  | circuits than the brain of an ant . The human brain far exceeded that complexity , and the programming of the human brain extended over many decades . How could anyone seriously expect to understand it ? There was also a philosophical problem . Goedel 's Theorem : that no system could explain itself , and no machine could understand its own workings . At most , Gerhard believed that a human brain might , after years of work , decipher a frog brain . But a human brain could never decipher itself in the same detail . For that you would need a superhuman brain . Gerhard thought that someday a computer would be developed that could untangle the billions of cells and hundreds of billions of interconnections in the human brain . Then , at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man would n't have done the work  --  another order of intelligence would have done it . And man would not know , of course , how the computer worked . Morris entered the room with a cup of coffee . He sipped it , and glanced at Benson through the glass . " How 's he holding up ? " " Okay , " Gerhard said . " Electrode six , five and five , " Richards intoned . In the next room , Benson failed to react . He sat talking with Ross about the operation , and his lingering headache . He was quite calm and apparently unaffected . They repeated the stimulation , still without change in Benson 's behavior . Then they went on . " Electrode seven , five and five , " Richards said . He delivered the shock . Benson sat up abruptly . " Oh , " he said , " that was nice . " " What was ? " Ross said . " You can do that again if you want to . " " How does it feel ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benson said . His whole appearance seemed to change subtly . " You know , " he said after a moment , " you 're really a wonderful person , Dr. Ross . " " Thank you , " she said . " Very attractive , too . I do n't know if I ever told you before . " " How do you feel now ? " " I 'm really very fond of you , " Benson said . " I do n't know if I told you that before . " " Nice , " Gerhard said , watching through the glass . " Very nice . " Morris nodded . " A strong P-terminal . He 's clearly turned on . Gerhard made a note of it . Morris sipped his coffee . They waited until Benson settled down . Then , blandly , Richards said , " Electrode eight , five millivolts , five seconds . " The stimulation series continued . At noon , McPherson showed up for interfacing . No one was surprised to see him . In a sense , this was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had implanted electrodes and a computer and a power pack , and they had hooked everything up . But nothing functioned until the interfacing switches were thrown . It was a little like building an automobile and then finally turning the ignition . Gerhard showed him notes from the stimulation series . " At five millivolts on a pulse-form stimulus , we have three Thursday , March 11 , 1971 : Interfacing 111  | positive terminals and two negatives . The positives are seven , nine , and thirty-one . The negatives are five and thirty-two . " McPherson glanced at the notes , then looked through the one-way glass at Benson . " Are any of the positives true P 's ? " " Seven seems to be . " " Strong ? " " Pretty strong . When we stimulated him , he said he liked it , and he began to act sexually aroused towar , 3 Jan . " " Is it too strong ? Will it tip him over ? " Gerhard shook his head . " No , " he said . " Not unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . There was that Norwegian ... " " I do n't think we have to worry about that , " McPherson said . " We 've got Benson in the hospital for the next few days . If anything seems to be going wrong , we can switch to other electrodes . We 'll just keep track of him for a while . What about nine ? " " Very weak . Equivocal , really . " " How did he respond ? " " There was a subtle increase in spontaneity , more tendency to smile , to tell happy and positive anecdotes . " McPherson seemed unimpressed . " And thirty-one ? " " Clear tranquilizing effect . Calmness , relaxation , happiness . " McPherson rubbed his hands together . " I guess we can get on with it , " he said . He looked once through the glass at Benson , and said , " Interface the patient with seven and thirty-one . " McPherson was clearly feeling a sense of high drama and medical history . But Gerhard was n't ; he got off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked to a corner of the room where there was a computer con-I  | BENSON , H. F. INTERFACING PROCEDURE POSSIBLE ELECTRODES : 40 , designated serially POSSIBLE VOLTAGES : continuous POSSIBLE DURATIONS : continuous POSSIBLE WAVE FORMS : pulse only Gerhard pressed a button and the screen went blank .

WHAT VOLTAGE WILL BE APPLIED r'O ELECTRODE SEVEN ? 5 my 3 . WHAT DURATION WILL BE APPLIED TO ELECTRODE SEVEN ? 5 sec There was a pause , and the questions continued for electrode 31 . Gerhard typed in the answers . Watching him , McPherson said to Morris , " This is amusing , in a way . We 're telling the tiny computer how to work . The little computer gets its instructions from the big computer , which gets its instructions from Gerhard , who has a bigger computer than any of them . " " Maybe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : INTERFACING PARAMETERS STORED . READY TO PROGRAM AUXILIARY UNIT . sole mounted beneath a TV screen . He began to touch the buttons . The TV screen glowed to life . After a moment , letters appeared on it . Thursday , March 11 , 1971 : Interfacing 113  | Morris sighed . He hoped that he would never reach the point in his life when he was referred to by a computer as an " auxiliary unit . " Gerhard typed quietly , a soft clicking sound . On the other TV screens , they could see the inner circuitry of the small computer . It glowed intermittently as the wiring locked in . BENSON HF HAS BEEN INTERFACED . IMPLANTED DEVICE NOW READING EEG DATA AND DELIVERING APPROPRIATE FEEDBACK . That was all there was to it . Somehow Morris was disappointed ; he knew it would be this way , but he had expected  --  or needed  --  something more dramatic . Gerhard ran a systems check which came back negative . The screen went blank and then came through with a final message : UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOR THERAPY . Gerhard smiled . In the next room , Benson was still talking quietly with Ross . Neither of them seemed to have noticed anything different at all . Janet Ross finished the stimulation series profoundly depressed . She stood in the corridor watching as Benson was wheeled away . She had a last glimpse of the white bandages around his neck as the nurse turned the corner ; then he was gone . t  | She walked down the hallway in the other direction , through the multicolored NPS doors . For some reason , she found herself thinking about Arthur 's yellow Ferrari . It was so marvelous and elegant and irrelevant to anything . The perfect toy . She wished she were in Monte Carlo , stepping out of Arthur 's Ferrari wearing her Balenciaga gown , going up the stairs to the casino to gamble with nothing more important than money . She looked at her watch . Christ , it was only 12:15 . She had half the day ahead of her . What was it like to be a pediatrician ? Probably fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet training . Not a bad way to live . She thought again of the bandages on Benson 's shoulder , and went into Telecomp . She had hoped to speak to Gerhard alone , but instead everyone was in the room ? McPherson , Morris , Ellis , everyone . They were all jubilant , toasting each other with coffee in Styrofoam cups . Someone thrust a cup into her hands , and McPherson put his arm around her in a fatherly way . " I gather we turned Benson on to you today . " " Yes , you did , " she said , managing to smile . " Well , I guess you 're used to that . " " Not exactly , " she said . The room got quieter , the festive feeling slid away . She felt bad about that , but not really . There was nothing amusing about shocking a person into sexual arousal . It was physiologically interesting , was frightening and pathetic , but not funny . Why did they all find it so goddamned funny ? Ellis produced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Makes it Irish , " he said , with a wink . " Much better . " She nodded , and glanced across the room at Gerhard . I  | " Drink up , drink up , " Ellis said . Gerhard was talking to Morris about something . It seemed a very intent conversation ; then she heard Morris say , " . . . you please pass the pussy ? " Gerhard laughed ; Morris laughed . It was some kind of joke . " Not bad , considering , " Ellis said . " What do you think ? " " Very good , " she said , taking a small sip . She managed to get away from Ellis and McPherson and went over to Gerhard . He was momentarily alone ; Morris had gone off to refill his cup . " Listen , " she said , " can I talk to you for a second ? " " Sure , " Gerhard said . He bent his head closer to hers . " What is it ? " " I want to know something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the main computer ? " " You mean monitor the implanted unit ? " " Yes . " Gerhard shrugged . " I guess so , but why bother ? We know the implanted unit is working ? " " I know , " she said . " I know . But will you do it anyway , as a precaution ? " Gerhard said nothing . His eyes said : Precaution against what ? " Please ? " " Okay , " he said . " I 'll punch in a monitoring subroutine as soon as they leave . " He nodded to the group . " I 'll have the computer check on him twice an hour . " She frowned . " Four times an hour ? " " How about every ten minutes ? " she said . " Okay , " he said . " Every ten minutes . " " Thanks , " she said . Then she drained her coffee , feeling the warmth hit her stomach , and she left the room .  | Ellis sat in a corner of Room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were two people from the rad lab doing a radiation check ; there was one girl drawing blood for the chem lab , to check steroid levels ; there was an EEG technician resetting the monitors ; and there were Gerhard and Richards , taking a final look at the interface wiring . Throughout it all , Benson lay motionless , breathing easily , staring up at the ceiling . He did not seem to notice the people touching him , moving an arm here , shifting a sheet there . He stared straight up at the ceiling . One of the rad-lab men had hairy hands protruding from the cuffs of his white lab coat . For a moment , the man rested his hairy dark hand on Benson 's bandages . Ellis thought about the monkeys he had operated on . There was nothing to that except technical expertise , because you always knew  --  no matter how hard you pretended  --  that it was a monkey and not a human being , and if you slipped and cut the monkey from ear to ear , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions , no relatives , no lawyers , no press , no nothing  --  not even a nasty note from Requisitions asking what was happening to all those eighty-dollar monkeys . Nobody gave a damn . And neither did he . He was n't interested in helping monkeys . He was interested in helping human beings . Benson stirred . " I 'm tired , " he said . He glanced over at Ellis . Thursday , March 11 , 1971 : Interfacing 117  | Ellis said , " About ready to wrap it up , boys ? " One by one , the technicians stepped back from the bed , nodding , collected their instruments and their data , and left the room . Gerhard and Richards were the last to go . Finally Ellis was alone with Benson . " You feel like sleeping ? " Ellis said . " I feel like a goddamned machine . I feel like an automobile in a complicated service station . I feel like I 'm being repaired . " Benson was getting angry . Ellis could feel his own tension building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restrain Benson when the attack came . But he remained seated . " That 's a lot of crap , " Ellis said . Benson glared at him , breathing deeply . Ellis looked at the monitors over the bed . The brain waves were going irregular , moving into an attack configuration . Benson wrinkled his nose and sniffed . " What 's that smell ? " he said . " That awful ? " Above the bed , a red monitor light blinked STIMULATION . The brain waves spun in a distorted tangle of white lines for five seconds . Simultaneously , Benson 's pupils dilated . Then the lines were smooth again ; the pupils returned to normal size . Benson turned away , staring out the window at the afternoon sun . " You know , " he said , " it 's really a very nice day , is n't it ? "  | For no particular reason , Janet Ross came back to the hospital at 11 p.m . She had gone to see a movie with a pathology resident who had been asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen a murder mystery , which the resident claimed was the only kind of movie he attended . This one featured five murders before she stopped counting them . In the darkness , she had glanced at the resident , and he was smiling . His reaction was so stereotyped  --  the pathologist drawn to violence and death that she found herself thinking of the other stereotypes in medicine : the sadistic surgeons and the childish pediatricians and the woman-hating gynecologists . And the crazy psychiatrists . Afterward , he had driven her back to the hospital because she had left her car in the hospital parking lot . But instead of driving home she had gone up to the NPS . For no particular reason . The NPS was deserted , but she expected to find Gerhard and Richards at work , and they were , poring over computer print-outs in Telecomp . They hardly noticed when she came into the room and got herself some coffee . " Trouble ? " she said . Gerhard scratched his head . " Now it 's Martha , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now Martha is becoming nice . Everything 's screwed up . " Richards smiled . " You have your patients , Jan , " he said , " and we have ours .

" I was wondering why you came in . " He smiled . " Or was it just a bad date ? " " Just a bad movie , " she said . Gerhard punched buttons on the console . Letters and numbers began to print out .

If you slap the kid 's hand every time he reaches for the cookies , pretty soon he wo n't reach so often . Look . " She drew a quick sketch . Number of reaches for jar " Now , " she said , " that 's negative reinforcement . The kid reaches , but he gets hurt . So he stops reaching . Eventually he 'll quit altogether . Okay ?

" " Benson is going into a positive progression cycle . " " I do n't understand . " " It 's just like Cecil . Cecil was the first monkey to be wired with electrodes to a computer . That was back in ' 65 . The computer was n't miniaturized then ; it was a big clunky computer , and the monkey was wired up by actual wires . Okay . Cecil had epilepsy . The computer detected the start of a seizure , and delivered a counter-shock to stop it . Thursday , March 11 , 1971 : Interfacing 123  | Okay . Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand reaching for the cookies less and less often . But instead the reverse happened . Cecil liked the shocks . And he began to initiate seizures in order to experience the pleasurable shocks . " " And that 's what Benson is doing ? " " I think so . " Gerhard shook his head . " Listen , Jan , that 's all interesting . But a person ca n't start and stop epileptic seizures at will . They ca n't control it . The seizures are ? " " Involuntary , " she said . " That 's right . You have no more control over them than you do over heart rate and blood pressure and sweating and all the other involuntary acts . " There was a long pause . Gerhard said , " You 're going to tell me I 'm wrong . " On the screen , the computer blinked : " I 'm going to tell you , " she said , " that you 've cut too many conferences . You know about autonomic learning ? " After a guilty pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery for a long time . Classically , it was believed that you could learn to control only voluntary acts . You could learn to drive a car , but you could n't learn to lower your blood pressure . Of course , there were those yogis who supposedly could reduce oxygen requirements of their body and slow their heartbeats to near death . They could reverse intestinal peristalsis and drink liquids through the anus . But that was all unproven  --  and theoretically impossible . " Gerhard nodded cautiously . " Well , it turns out to be perfectly possible . You can teach a rat to blush in only one ear . Right ear or left ear , 124 THE TERMINAL MAN  | take your pick . You can teach it to lower or raise blood pressure or heartbeat . And you can do the same thing with people . It 's not impossible . It can be done . " " How ? " He asked the question with unabashed curiosity . Whatever embarrassment he had felt before was gone . " Well , with people who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is put them in a room with a bloodpressure cuff on their arm . Whenever the blood pressure goes down , a bell rings . You tell the person to try to make the bell ring as often as possible . They work for that reward ? a bell ringing . At first it happens by accident . Then pretty soon they learn how to make it happen more often . The bell rings more frequently . After a few hours , it 's ringing a lot . " Gerhard scratched his head . " And you think Benson is producing more seizures to be rewarded with shocks ? " " Yes . " " Well , what 's the difference ? He still ca n't have any seizures . The computer always prevents them from happening . " " Not true , " she said .

Gerhard turned back to the computer . 0 ? FRIDAY , MARCH 12 , 1971 : 00 00 BREAKDOWN  | The seventh ( Special Surgical ) floor was quiet ; there were two nurses at the station . One was making progress notes in a patient 's chart ; the other was eating a candy bar and reading a movie magazine . Neither paid much attention to Ross as she went to the chart shelf , opened Benson 's record , and checked it . She wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her astonishment she found that he had not . " Why has n't Benson gotten his thorazine ? " she demanded . The nurses looked up in surprise . " Benson ? " " The patient in seven-ten . " She glanced at her watch ; it was after midnight . " He was supposed to be started on thorazine at noon . Twelve hours ago . " " I 'm sorry ... may I ? " One of the nurses reached for the chart . Ross handed it to her and watched while she turned to the page of nursing orders . McPherson 's order for thorazine was circled in red by a nurse , with the cryptic notation " Call . " Ross was thinking that without heavy doses of thorazine Benson 's psychotic thinking would be unchecked , and could be dangerous . " Oh , yes , " the nurse said . " I remember now . Dr. Morris told us that only medication orders from him or from Dr. Ross were to be followed . We do n't know this Dr. McPhee , so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

" " Look , Doc , it was only a few minutes ? " " How long ? " " I ran out of cigarettes . The hospital does n't have any machines . I had to go to that coffee shop across the street . I was gone about three minutes . That was around eleventhirty . The nurses said they 'd keep an eye on things . " " Great , " Ross said . She checked the bedside table and saw that Benson 's shaving equipment was there , his wallet , his car keys . . . all there . The nurse stuck her head in the door , answering the call .

Then call hospital security . Is that clear ? " " Yes , Doctor , " the nurse said , and hurried from the room . Ross sat down on the edge of Benson 's bed and turned her attention to the cop . " Where did he get those bags ? " the cop said . She had already figured that out . " One from the bedside wastebasket , " she said . " One from the wastebasket by the door . One from the bathroom wastebasket . Two towels from the bathroom . " " Clever , " the cop said . He pointed to the closet . " But he ca n't get far . He left his clothes . " " Took his shoes .

" " No , last month . " " Look , lady , I do n't need any of your lip right now . " She saw then that he was really quite young , in his early twenties , and she saw that he was afraid . He had screwed up , and he did n't know what would happen . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " Yes , tonight . " " He made one call , " the cop said . " About eleven . " " Did you listen to it ? " " No . " He shrugged . " I never thought . . . " His voice trailed off . " You know . " " So he made one call at eleven , and left at eleven-thirty . " She walked outside to the hallway and looked down the corridor to the nurses ' station . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to pass the nurses ' station to reach the elevator . He 'd never make it . What else could he have done ? She looked toward the other end of the hall . There was a stairway at the far end . He could walk down . But seven flights of stairs ? Benson was too weak for that . And when he got to the ground-floor lobby , there he 'd be , in his bathrobe with his head bandaged . The reception desk would stop him . " I do n't get it , " the cop said , coming out into the hallway . " Where could he go ? " " He 's a very bright man , " Ross said . It was a fact that they all tended to forget . To the cops , Benson was a criminal charged with assault , one of the hundreds of querulous types they saw each day . To the hospital staff , he was a diseased man , unhappy , dangerous , borderline psychotic . Everyone tended to forget that Benson was also  | brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many intelligent men worked . On the initial psychological testing at the NPS , his abbreviated WAIS I.Q. test had scored 144 . He was fully capable of planning to leave , then listening at the door , hearing the cop and the nurse discuss going for cigarettes  --  and then making his escape in a matter of minutes . But how ? Benson must have known that he could never get out of the hospital in his bathrobe . He had left his street clothes in his room  --  he probably could n't get out wearing those , either . Not at midnight . The lobby desk would have stopped him . Visiting hours had ended three hours before . What the hell would he do ? The cop went up to the nurses ' station to phone in a report . Ross followed along behind him , looking at the doors . Room 709 was a burns patient ; she opened the door and looked inside , making sure only the patient was there . Room 708 was empty ; a kidney-transplant patient had been discharged that afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was marked SUPPLIES . It was a standard room on surgical floors .

The rest of the shelf contained neatly folded piles of white trousers , shirts , and jackets worn by hospital orderlies . She called for the nurse .

Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elevator to the lobby . Nobody would have noticed him ; orderlies come and go at all hours .

" He was tranked out of his skull with thorazine , and ? " " Never got it , " Ross said . " Never got it ? " " What 's thorazine ? " the cop said , taking notes . " The nurses had a question on the order and did n't administer it . He had no sedatives and no tranquilizers since midnight last night . " " Christ , " Ellis said .

" Ross said , with a sarcastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " See if you can find her in the phone book , " Ross said . Morris began to check ; the phone rang , and Ellis answered it .

Benson is on a learning cycle with his implanted computer . His stimulation points conform to the projected curve exactly . " " That 's wonderful , " Ross said . As she listened , she glanced at Ellis , Morris , and the cop . They watched her expectantly . " It 's exactly what you said , " Gerhard said . " Benson apparently likes the shocks . He 's starting seizures more and more often . The curve is going up sharply . " " When will he tip over ? " " Not long , " Gerhard said . " Assuming that he does n't break the cycle  --  and I doubt that he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-four a.m . " " You have a confirmed projection on that ? " she asked , frowning .

" " Christ , " Ellis said , looking at the wall clock . " Less than six hours from now . " Across the room , Morris had put aside the phone books and was talking to Information .

" He could have called someone else . " " Whoever he called may be in a lot of trouble in a few hours , " Ross said . She flipped open Benson 's chart . " It looks like a long night . We 'd better get busy . "  | The freeway was crowded . The freeway was always crowded , even at 1 a.m. on a Friday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stretching ahead like an angry snake for miles . So many people . Where were they going at this hour ? Janet Ross usually took pleasure in the freeways . There had been times when she had driven home from the hospital at night , with the big green signs flashing past overhead , and the intricate web of overpasses and underpasses , and the exhilarating anonymous speed , and she had felt wonderful , expansive , free . She had been raised in California , and as a child she remembered the first of the freeways . The system had grown up as she had grown , and she did not see it as a menace or an evil . It was part of the landscape ; it was fast ; it was fun . The automobile was important to Los Angeles , a city more technology-dependent than any in the world . Los Angeles could not survive without the automobile , as it could not survive without water piped in from hundreds of miles away , and as it could not survive without certain building technologies . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been true since early in the century . But in recent years Ross had begun to recognize the subtle psychological effects of living your life inside an automobile . Los Angeles had no sidewalk cafes , because no one walked ; the sidewalk cafe , where you could stare at passing people , was not stationary but mobile . It changed Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 139  | with each traffic light , where people stopped , stared briefly at each other , then drove on . But there was something inhuman about living inside a cocoon of tinted glass and stainless steel , air-conditioned , carpeted , stereophonic tape-decked , power-optioned , isolated . It thwarted some deep human need to congregate , to be together , to see and be seen . Local psychiatrists recognized an indigenous depersonalization syndrome . Los Angeles was a town of recent emigrants and therefore strangers ; cars kept them strangers , and there were few institutions that served to bring them together . Practically no one went to church , and work groups were not entirely satisfactory . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without friends , far from families and old homes . Often they became suicidal  --  and a common method of suicide was the automobile . The police referred to it euphemistically as " single unit fatalities . " You picked your overpass , and hit it at eighty or ninety , foot flat to the floor . Sometimes it took hours to cut the body out of the wreckage ... . Moving at sixty-five miles an hour , she shifted across five lanes of traffic and pulled off the freeway at Sunset , heading up into the Hollywood Hills , through an area known locally as the Swish Alps because of the many homosexuals who lived there . People with problems seemed drawn to Los Angeles . The city offered freedom ; its price was lack of supports . She came to Laurel Canyon and took the curves fast , tires squealing , headlamps swinging through the darkness . There was little traffic here ; she would reach Benson 's house in a few minutes . In theory , she and the rest of the NPS staff had a simple problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get him back into the hospital , they could uncouple his 140 THE TERMINAL MAN  | implanted computer and stop the progression series . Then they could sedate him and wait a few days before relinking him to a new set of terminals . They 'd obviously chosen the wrong electrodes the first time around ; that was a risk they accepted in advance . It was an acceptable risk because they expected to have a chance to correct any error . But that opportunity was no longer there . They had to get him back . A simple problem , with a relatively simple solution  --  check Benson 's known haunts . After reviewing his chart , they 'd all set out to different places . Ross was going to his house on Laurel . Ellis was going to a strip joint called the Jackrabbit Club , where Benson often went . Morris was going to Autotronics , Inc. , in Santa Monica , where Benson was employed ; Morris had called the president of the firm , who was coming to the offices to open them up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to compare notes and progress . A simple plan , and one she thought unlikely to work . But there was n't much else to do . She parked her car in front of Benson 's house and walked up the slate path to the front door . It was ajar ; from inside she could hear the sound of laughter and giggles . She knocked and pushed it open . " Hello ? " No one seemed to hear . The giggles came from somewhere at the back of the house . She stepped into the front hallway . She had never seen Benson 's house , and she wondered what it was like . Looking around , she realized she should have known . From the outside , the house was an ordinary wood-frame structure , a ranch-style house as unobtrusive in its appearance as Benson himself . But the inside looked like Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 141  | the drawing rooms of Louis XVI  --  graceful antique chairs and couches , tapestries on the walls , bare hardwood floors . " Anybody home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . There was no answer , but the laughter continued . She followed the sound toward the rear . She came into the kitchen antique gas stove , no oven , no dishwasher , no electric blender , no toaster . No machines , she thought . Benson had built himself a world without any sort of modern machine in it . The kitchen window looked out onto the back of the house . There was a small patch of lawn and a swimming pool , all perfectly ordinary and modern , Benson 's ordinary exterior again . The back yard was bathed in greenish light from the underwater pool lights . In the pool , two girls were laughing and splashing . She went outside . The girls were oblivious to her arrival . They continued to splash and shriek happily ; they wrestled with each other in the water . She stood on the pool deck and said , " Anybody home ? " They noticed her then , and moved apart from each other . " Looking for Harry ? " one of them said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a doctor . " One of the girls got out of the pool lithely and began toweling off . She wore a brief red bikini . " You just missed him , " the girl said . " But we were n't supposed to tell the cops . That 's what he said . " She put one leg on a chair to dry it with the towel . Ross realized the move was calculated , seductive , and demonstrative . These girls liked girls , she realized . " When did he leave ? " " Just a few minutes ago . " " How long have you been here ? " 142 THE TERMINAL MAN p " About a week , " the girl in the pool said . " Harry invited us to stay . He thought we were cute . " The other girl wrapped the towel around her shoulders and said , " We met him at the Jackrabbit . He comes there a lot . " Ross nodded . " He 's a lot of fun , " the girl said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing tonight ? " " What ? " " A hospital uniform . All white . " She shook her head . " What a riot . " " Did you talk to him ? " " Sure . " " What did he say ? " The girl in the red bikini started back inside the house . Ross followed her . " He said not to tell the cops . He said to have a good time . " " Why did he come here ? " " He had to pick up some stuff . " " What stuff ? " " Some stuff from his study . " " Where is the study ? " " I 'll show you . " She led her back into the house , through the living room . Her wet feet left small pools on the bare hardwood floor . " Is n't this place wild ? Harry 's really crazy . You ever heard him talk about things ? " " Yes . " " Then you know . He 's really nutty . " She gestured around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to see him ? " " He 's sick , " Ross said . " He must be , " the girl said . " I saw those bandages . What was he , in an accident ? " " He had an operation . " Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 143  | " No kidding . In a hospital ? " " Yes . " " No kidding . " They went through the living room and down a corridor toward the bedrooms . The girl turned right into one room , which was a study  --  antique desk , antique lamps , overstuffed couches . " He came in here and got some stuff . " " Did you see what he got ? " " We did n't really pay much attention . But he took some big rolls of paper . " She gestured with her hands . " Real big . They looked like blueprints or something . " " Blueprints ? " " Well , they were blue on the inside of the roll , and white on the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did he take anything else ? " " Yeah . A metal box . " " What kind of a metal box ? " Ross was thinking of a lunchbox , or a small suitcase . " It looked like a tool kit , maybe . I saw it open for a moment , before he closed it . It seemed to have tools and stuff inside . " " Did you notice anything in particular ? " The girl was silent then . She bit her lip . " Well , I did n't really see , but ... " " Yes ? " " It looked like he had a gun in there . " " Did he say where he was going ? " " No . " " Did he give any clue ? " " No . " " Did he say he was coming back ? " " Well , that was funny , " the girl said . " He kissed me , and he kissed Suzie , and he said to have a good time , and he said not to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd 144 THE TERMINAL MAN  | be seeing us again . " She shook her head . " It was funny . But you know how Harry is . " " Yes , " Ross said . " I know how Harry is . " She looked at her watch . It was 1:47 . There were only four hours left . The first thing that Ellis noticed was the smell : hot , damp , fetid  --  a dark warm animal smell . He wrinkled his nose in distaste . How could Benson tolerate a place like this ? He watched as the spotlight swung through the darkness and came to rest on a pair of long tapering thighs . There was an expectant rustling in the audience . It reminded Ellis of his days in the Navy , stationed in Baltimore . That was the last time he had been in a place like this , hot and sticky with fantasies and frustrations . That had been a long time ago . It was a shock to think how fast the time had passed . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cynthia Sin-cere . A big hand for the lovely Cynthia ! " The spotlight widened onstage , to show a rather ugly but spectacularly constructed girl . The band began to play . When the spotlight was wide enough to hit Cynthia 's eyes , she squinted and began an awkward dance . She paid no attention to the music , but nobody seemed to mind . Ellis looked at the audience . There were a lot of men here ? and a lot of very tough-looking girls with short hair . " Harry Benson ? " the manager said , at his elbow . " Yeah , he comes in a lot . " Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 145  | " Have you seen him lately ? " " I do n't know about lately , " the manager said . He coughed . Ellis smelled sweet alcoholic breath . " But I tell you , " the manager said , " I wish he would n't hang around , you know ? I think he 's a little nuts . And always bothering the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls ? Fucking murder , that 's what it is . " Ellis nodded , and scanned the audience . Benson had probably changed clothes ; certainly he would n't be wearing an orderly 's uniform any more . Ellis looked at the backs of the heads , at the area between hairline and shirt collar . He looked for a white bandage . He saw none . " But you have n't seen him lately ? " " No , " the manager said , shaking his head . " Not for a week or so . " A waitress went by wearing a rabbitlike white fur bikini . " Sal , you seen Harry lately ? " " He 's usually around , " she said vaguely , and wandered off with a tray of drinks . " I wish he would n't hang around , bothering the girls , " the manager said , and coughed again , sweetly . Ellis moved deeper into the club . The spotlight swung through smoky air over his head , following the movements of the girl on stage . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two-step shuffle , hands behind her back , eyes looking vacantly out at the audience . Ellis understood , watching her , why Benson thought of strippers as machines . They were mechanical , no question about it . And artificial  --  when the bra came off , he could see the U-shaped surgical incision beneath each breast , where the plastic had been inserted . Jaglon would love this , he thought . It would fit right into his theories about machine sex . Jaglon was one of the Development boys and he was preoccupied with the idea of artificial intelligence merging with human intelligence . 146 THE TERMINAL MAN  | He argued that , on the one hand , cosmetic surgery and implanted machinery were making man more mechanical , while on the other hand robot developments were making machines more human . It was only a matter of time before people began having sex with humanoid robots . Perhaps it 's already happening , Ellis thought , looking at the stripper . He looked back at the audience , satisfying himself that Benson was not there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the men 's room . The men 's room was small and reeked of vomit . He grimaced again , and stared at himself in the cracked mirror over the washbasin . Whatever else was true about the Jackrabbit Club , it produced an olfactory assault . He wondered if that mattered to Benson . He went back into the club itself and made his way toward the door . " Find him ? " the manager asked . Ellis shook his head and left . Once outside , he breathed the cool night air , and got into his car . The notion of smells intrigued him . It was a problem he had considered before , but never really resolved in his own mind . His operation on Benson was directed toward a specific part of the brain , the limbic system . It was a very old part of the brain , in terms of evolution . Its original purpose had been the control of smell . In fact , the old term for it was rhinencephalon  --  the " smelling brain . " The rhinencephalon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . It controlled the most primitive behavior  --  anger and fear , lust and hunger , attack and withdrawal . Reptiles like crocodiles had little else to direct their behavior . Man , on the other hand , had a cerebral cortex . But the cerebral cortex was a recent addition . Its modern development had begun only two million years ago ; in its present state , the cerebral cortex of man was only 100,000 Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 147  | years old . In terms of evolutionary time scales , that was nothing . The cortex had grown up around the limbic brain , which remained unchanged , embedded deep inside the new cortex . That cortex , which could feel love , and worry about ethical conduct , and write poetry , had to make an uneasy peace with the crocodile brain at its core . Sometimes , as in the case of Benson , the peace broke down , and the crocodile brain took over intermittently . What was the relationship of smell to all this ? Ellis was not sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange smells . But was there anything else ? Any other effect ? He did n't know , and as he drove he reflected that it did n't much matter . The only problem was to find Benson before his crocodile brain took over . Ellis had seen that happen once , in the NPS . Ellis had watched it through the one-way glass . Benson had been quite normal  --  and suddenly he had lashed out against the wall , striking it viciously , picking up his chair , smashing it against the wall . The attack had begun without warning , and had been carried out with utter , total , unthinking viciousness . Six a.m. , he thought . There was n't much time . " What is it , some kind of emergency ? " Farley asked , unlocking the door to Autotronics . " You could say so , " Morris said , standing outside , shivering . It was a cold night , and he had been waiting half an hour . Waiting for Farley to show up . 148 THE TERMINAL MAN  | Farley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or perhaps he was just sleepy . He seemed to take forever to unlock the offices and let Morris inside . He turned on the lights in a rather plain lobby-reception area . Then he went back toward the rear of the building . The rear of Autotronics was a single cavernous room . Desks were scattered here and there around several pieces of enormous , glittering machinery . Morris frowned slightly . " I know what you 're thinking , " Farley said . " You 're thinking it 's a mess . " " No , I ? " " Well , it is . But we get the job done , I can tell you that . " He pointed across the room . " That 's Harry 's desk , next to Ha " Hap ? " Farley gestured to a large , spidery metal construction across the room . " Hap , " he said , " is short for Hopelessly Automatic Ping-pong Player . " He grinned . " Not really , " he said . " But we have our little jokes here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it , staring . " It plays ping-pong ? " " Not well , " Farley admitted . " But we 're working on that . It 's a DOD  --  Department of Defense  --  grant , and the terms of the grant were to devise a ping-pong-playing robot . I know what you 're thinking . You 're thinking it is n't an important project . " Morris shrugged . He did n't like being told what he was thinking all the time . Farley smiled . " God knows what they want it for , " he said . " Of course , the capability would be striking . Imagine ? a computer that could recognize a sphere moving rapidly through three-dimensional space , with the ability Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 149  | to contact the sphere and knock it back according to certain rules . Must land between the white lines , not off the table , and so on . I doubt , " he said , " that they 'll use it for ping-pong tournaments . " He went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big orange RADIATION sign on it , and beneath , AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY . He removed two jars . " Want some coffee ? " Morris was staring at the signs . " That 's just to discourage the secretaries , " Farley said , and laughed again . His jovial mood bothered Morris . He watched as Farley made instant coffee . Morris went over to Benson 's desk and began checking the drawers . " What is it about Harry , anyway ? " " How do you mean ? " Morris asked . The top drawer contained supplies  --  paper , pencils , slide rule , scribbled notes and calculations . The second drawer was a file drawer ; it seemed to hold mostly letters . " Well , he was in the hospital , was n't he ? " " Yes . He had an operation , and left . We 're trying to find him now . " " He 's certainly gotten strange , " Farley said . " Uh-huh , " Morris said . He was thumbing through the files . Business letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it began , " Farley said . " It was during Watershed Week . " Morris looked up from the letters . " During what ? " " Watershed Week , " Farley said . " How do you take your coffee ? " " Black . " Farley gave him a cup , stirred artificial cream into his  | own . " Watershed Week , " he said , " was a week in July of 1969 . You 've probably never heard of it . " Morris shook his head . " That was n't an official title , " Farley said , " but that was what we called it . Everybody in our business knew it was coming , you see . " " What was coming ? " " The Watershed . Computer scientists all over the world knew it was coming , and they watched for it . It happened in July of 1969 . The information-handling capacity of all the computers in the world exceeded the informationhandling capacity of all the human brains in the world . Computers could receive and store more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That 's the Watershed ? " " You bet it is , " Farley said . Morris sipped the coffee . It burned his tongue , but he woke up a little . " Is that a joke ? " " Hell , no , " Farley said . " It 's true . The Watershed was passed in 1969 , and computers have been steadily pulling ahead since then . By 1975 , they 'll lead human beings by fifty to one in terms of capacity . " He paused . " Harry was awfully upset about that . " " I can imagine , " Morris said . " And that was when it began for him . He got very strange , very secretive . " Morris looked around the room , at the large pieces of computer equipment standing in different areas . It was an odd sensation : the first time he could recall being in a room littered with computers . He realized that he had made some mistakes about Benson . He had assumed that Benson was pretty much like everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as this was like everyone else . The experience must change you . He remembered that  | Ross had once said that it was a liberal myth that everybody was fundamentally the same . Lots of people were n't . They were n't like everybody else . Farley was different , too , he thought . In another situation , he would have dismissed Farley as a jovial clown . But he was obviously bright as hell . Where did that grinning , comic manner come from ? " You know how fast this is moving ? " Farley said . " Damned fast . We 've gone from milliseconds to nanoseconds in just a few years . When the computer ILLIAC I was built in 1952 , it could do eleven thousand arithmetical operations a second . Pretty fast , right ? Well , they 're almost finished with rLLrAC iv now . It will do two hundred million operations a second . It 's the fourth generation . Of course , it could n't have been built without the help of other computers . They used two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rLLrAC . " Morris drank his coffee . Perhaps it was his fatigue , perhaps the spookiness of the room , but he was beginning to feel some kinship with Benson . Computers to design computers  --  maybe they were taking over , after all . What would Ross say about that ? A shared delusion ? " Find anything interesting in his desk ? " " No , " Morris said . He sat down in the chair behind the desk and looked around the room . He was trying to act like Benson , to think like Benson , to be Benson . " How did he spend his time ? " " I do n't know , " Farley said , sitting on another desk across the room . " He got pretty distant and withdrawn the last few months . I know he had some trouble with the law . And I knew he was going into the hospital . I knew that . He did n't like your hospital much . " " How is that ? " Morris asked , not very interested . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 152 THE TERMINAL MAN  | Farley did n't answer . Instead , he went over to a bulletin board , where clippings and photos had been tacked up . He removed one yellowing newspaper item and gave it to Morris . It was from the Los Angeles Times , dated July 17 , 1969 . The headline read : UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL GETS NEW COMPUTER . The story outlined the acquisition of the IBM System 360 computer which was being installed in the hospital basement , and would be used for research , assistance in operations , and a variety of other functions . " You notice the date ? " Farley said . " Watershed Week . " Morris stared at it and frowned . " I am trying to be logical , Dr. Ross . " " I understand , Harry . " " I think it 's important to be logical and rational when we discuss these things , do n't you ? " " Yes , I do . " She sat in the room and watched the reels of the tape recorder spin . Across from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes closed , cigarette burning in his fingers . Morris drank another cup of coffee as he listened . She was making a list of what they knew , trying to decide what their next step should be . The tape spun on . " I classify things according to what I call trends to be opposed , " Benson said . " There are four important trends to be opposed . Do you want to hear them ? " Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 153  | " Yes , of course . " " Do you really ? " " Yes , really . " " Well , trend number one is the generality of the computer . The computer is a machine but it 's not like any machine in human history . Other machines have a specific function  --  like cars , or refrigerators , or dishwashers . We expect machines to have specific functions . But computers do n't . They can do all sorts of things . " " Surely computers are ? " " Please let me finish . Trend number two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , computers were n't autonomous . They were like adding machines ; you had to be there all the time , punching buttons , to make them work . Like cars : cars wo n't drive without drivers . But now things are different . Computers are becoming autonomous . You can build in all sorts of instructions about what to do next  --  and you can walk away and let the computer handle things . " " Harry , I ? " " Please do n't interrupt me . This is very serious . Trend number three is miniaturization . You know all about that . A computer that took up a whole room in 1950 is now about the size of a carton of cigarettes . Pretty soon it 'll be smaller than that . " There was a pause on the tape . " Trend number four ? " Benson began , and she clicked the tape off . She looked at Ellis and Morris . " This is n't getting us anywhere , " she said . They did n't reply , just stared with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information . Benson home at 12:30 . Picked up ? blueprints , ? gun , and tool kit .  | Benson not seen in Jackrabbit Club recently . Benson upset by UH computer , installed 7/69 . " Suggest anything to you ? " Ellis asked . " No , " Ross said . " But I think one of us should talk to McPherson . " She looked at Ellis , who nodded without energy . Morris shrugged slightly . " All right , " she said . " I 'll do it . " It was 4:30 a.m . " The fact is , " Ross said , " we 've exhausted all our options . Time is running out . " McPherson stared at her across his desk . His eyes were dark and tired . " What do you expect me to do ? " he said . " Notify the police . " " The police are already notified . They 've been notified from the beginning by one of their own people . I understand the seventh floor is swarming with cops now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " For Christ 's sake , the police brought him here for the operation . Of course they know about it . " " But they do n't really know what it involves . " " They have n't asked . " " And they do n't know about the computer projection for 6 a.m . " " What about it ? " he said . She was becoming angry with him . He was so damned stubborn . He knew perfectly well what she was saying . " I think their attitude might be different if they knew that Benson was going to have a seizure at six a.m . " " I think you 're right , " McPherson said . He shifted his weight heavily in his chair . " I think they might stop thinking about him as an escaped man wanted on a charge of  | assault . And they would begin thinking of him as a crazy murderer with wires in his brain . " He sighed . " Right now , their objective is to apprehend him . If we tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But innocent lives may be involved . If the projection ? " " The projection , " McPherson said , " is just that . A computer projection . It is only as good as its input and that input consists of three timed stimulations . You can draw a lot of curves through three graph points . You can extrapolate it a lot of ways . We have no positive reason to believe he 'll tip over at six a.m . In actual fact , he may not tip over at all . " She glanced around the room , at the charts on his walls . McPherson plotted the future of the NPS in this room , and he kept a record of it on his walls , in the form of elaborate , multicolored charts . She knew what those charts meant to him ; she knew what the NPS meant to him ; she knew what Benson meant to him . But even so , his position was unreasonable and irresponsible . Now how was she going to say that ? " Look , Jan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've exhausted all our options . I disagree . I think we have the option of waiting . I think there is a possibility he will return to the hospital , return to our care . And as long as that is possible , I prefer to wait . " " You 're not going to tell the police ? " " No . " " If he does n't come back , " she said , " and if he attacks someone during a seizure , do you really want that on your head ? " " It 's already on my head , " McPherson said , and smiled sadly . It was 5 a.m.  | They were all tired , but none of them could sleep . They stayed in Telecomp , watching the computer projections as they inched up the plotted line toward a seizure state . The time was 5:30 , and then 5:45 . Ellis smoked an entire pack of cigarettes , and then left to get another . Morris stared at a journal in his lap but never turned the page ; from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock . Ross paced , and looked at the sunrise , the sky turning pink over the thin brown haze of smog to the east . Ellis came back with more cigarettes . Gerhard stopped working with the computers to make fresh coffee . Morris got up and stood watching Gerhard make it ; not speaking , not helping , just watching . Ross became aware of the ticking of the wall clock . It was strange that she had never noticed it before , because in fact it ticked quite loudly . And once a minute there was a mechanical click as the minute hand moved another notch . The sound disturbed her . She began to fix on it , waiting for that single click on top of the quieter ticking . Mildly obsessive , she thought . And then she thought of all the other psychological derangements she had experienced in the past . Deja vu , the feeling that she had been somewhere before ; depersonalization , the feeling that she was watching herself from across the room at some social gathering ; clang associations , delusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disease , sanity and  | insanity . It was a spectrum , and everybody fitted somewhere on the spectrum . Wherever you were on that spectrum , other people looked strange to you . Benson was strange to them ; without question , they were strange to Benson . At 6 a.m. , they all stood and stretched , glancing up at the clock . Nothing happened . " Maybe it 's six-four exactly , " Gerhard said . They waited . The clock showed 6:04 . Still nothing happened . No telephones rang , no messengers arrived . Nothing . Ellis slipped the cellophane wrapper off his cigarettes and crumpled it . The sound made Ross want to scream . He began to play with the cellophane , crumpling it , smoothing it out , crumpling it again . She gritted her teeth . The clock showed 6:10 , then 6:15 . McPherson came into the room . " So far , so good , " he said , smiled bleakly , and left . The others stared at each other . Five more minutes passed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the computer console . " Maybe the projection was wrong after all . We only had three plotting points . Maybe we should run another curve through . " He sat down at the console and punched buttons . The screen glowed with alternative curves , streaking white across the green background . Finally , he stopped . " No , " he said . " The computer sticks with the original curve . That should be the one . " " Well , obviously the computer is wrong , " Morris said . " It 's almost six-thirty . The cafeteria will be opening . Anybody want to have breakfast ? " " Sounds good to me , " Ellis said . He got out of his chair . " Jan ? " She shook her head . " I 'll wait here awhile . "  | " I do n't think it 's going to happen , " Morris said . " You better get some breakfast . " " I 'll wait here . " The words came out almost before she realized it . " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shot a glance at Ellis , and the two men left . She remained in the room with Gerhard . " Do you have confidence limits on that curve ? " she said . " I did , " Gerhard said . " But I do n't know any more . We 've passed the confidence limits already . They were about plus or minus two minutes for ninety-nine percent . " " You mean the seizure would have occurred between six-two and six-six ? " " Yeah , roughly . " He shrugged . " But it obviously did n't happen . " " It might take time before it was discovered . " " It might , " Gerhard nodded . He did n't seem convinced . She returned to the window . The sun was up now , shining with a pale reddish light . Why did sunrises always seem weaker , less brilliant , than sunsets ? They should be the same . Behind her she heard a single electronic beep . " Oh-oh , " Gerhard said . She turned . " What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical box on a shelf in the corner . The box was attached to a telephone . A green light glowed on the box . " What is it ? " she repeated . " That 's the special line , " he said . " The twenty-four-hour recording for the dog tag . " She went over and picked up the telephone from its cradle . She listened and heard a measured , resonant voice saying , " . . . should be advised that the body must not be cremated or damaged in any way until the implanted  | atomic material has been removed . Failure to remove the material presents a risk of radioactive contamination . For detailed information ? " She turned to Gerhard . " How do you turn it off ? " He pressed a button on the box . The recording stopped . " Hello ? " she said . There was a pause . Then a male voice said , " Whom am I speaking to ? " " This is Dr. Ross . " " Are you affiliated with the " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , I am . " " Get a pencil and paper . I want you to take an address down . This is Captain Anders of the Los Angeles police . " She gestured to Gerhard for something to write with . " What 's the problem , Captain ? " " We have a murder here , " Anders said , " and we 've got some questions for your people . " Three patrol cars were pulled up in front of the apartment building off Sunset . The flashing red lights had already drawn a crowd , despite the early hour and the morning chill . She parked her car down the street and walked back to the lobby . A young patrolman stopped her . " You a tenant ? " " I 'm Dr. Ross . Captain Anders called me . " He nodded toward the elevator . " Third floor , turn left , " he said , and let her through . The crowd watched curiously  | as she crossed the lobby and waited for the elevator . They were standing outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whispering among themselves . She wondered what they thought of her . The flashing lights from the patrol cars bathed the lobby intermittently with a red glow . Then the elevator came , and the doors closed . The interior of the elevator was tacky : plastic paneling made to look like wood , worn green carpeting stained by innumerable pets . She waited impatiently for it to creak up to the third floor . She knew what these buildings were like  --  full of hookers , full of fags , full of drugs and transients . You could rent an apartment without a long lease , just month to month . It was that kind of place . She stepped off at the third floor and walked down to a cluster of cops outside an apartment . Another policeman blocked her way ; she repeated that she was here to see Captain Anders , and he let her through with the admonition not to touch anything . It was a one-bedroom apartment furnished in pseudoSpanish style . Or at least she thought it was . Twenty men were crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was impossible to visualize how it had looked before the onslaught of police personnel . Anders came over to her . He was young , in his middle thirties , wearing a conservative dark suit . His hair was long enough to hang over the back of his collar and he wore horn-rimmed glasses . The effect was almost professorial , and quite unexpected . It was strange how you built up prejudices . When he spoke , his voice was soft : " Are you Dr. Ross ? " " Yes . " " Captain Anders . " He shook hands quickly and firmly . " Thank you for coming . The body is in the bedroom . The coroner 's man is in there , too . " Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 161  | He led the way into the bedroom . The deceased was a girl in her twenties , sprawled nude across the bed . Her head was crushed and she had been stabbed repeatedly . The bed was soaked with blood , and the room had the sickly sweet odor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a chair by the dressing table knocked over , cosmetics and lotions smeared on the rug , a bedside lamp broken . Six men were working in the room , one of them a doctor from the medical examiner 's office . He was filling out the death report . " This is Dr. Ross , " Anders said . " Tell her about it . " The doctor shrugged toward the body . " Brutal methodology , as you can see . Strong blow to the left temporal region , producing cranial depression and immediate unconsciousness . The weapon was that lamp over there . Blood of her type and some of her hair are affixed to it . " Ross glanced over at the lamp , then back to the body . " The stab wounds ? " " They 're later , almost certainly post-mortem . She was killed by the blow to the head . " Ross looked at the head . It was squashed in on one side , like a deflated football , distorting the features of what had once been a conventionally pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , moving closer to the girl , " that she 's put on half her make-up . As we reconstruct it , she 's sitting at the dressing table , over there , making up . The blow comes from above and from the side , knocking her over in the chair , spilling the lotions and crap . Then she 's lifted up " ? the doctor raised his arms and frowned in mock effort , lifting an invisible body ? " from the chair and placed on the bed . " " Somebody pretty strong ? " " Oh , yes . A man for sure . " " How do you know that ? "  | " Pubic hair in the shower drain . We 've found two varieties . One matches hers , the other is male . Male pubic hair as you know is more circular , less elliptical in cross section than female hair . " " No , " Ross said . " I did n't know that . " " I can give you a reference on it , if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that her killer had intercourse with her before the murder . We 've got a blood type on the seminal fluid and it 's AO . The man apparently takes a shower after intercourse , and then comes out and kills her . " Ross nodded . " Following delivery of the blow to the head , she 's lifted up and placed on the bed . At this time , she 's not bleeding much . No blood to speak of on the dressing table or rug . But now her killer picks up some instrument and stabs her in the stomach several times . You 'll notice that the deepest wounds are all in the lower abdomen , which may have some sexual connotations for the killer . But that 's just guessing on our part . " Ross nodded but said nothing . She had decided the coroner 's man was a creep ; she was n't going to tell him more than she had to . She moved closer to the body to examine the stab wounds . They were all small , puncturelike in appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds . " You find a weapon ? " " No , " the doctor said . " What do you think it was ? " " I 'm not sure . Nothing very sharp , but something strong ? it took a lot of force to penetrate this way with a relatively blunt instrument . " " Another argument that it 's a man , " Anders said . " Yes . I 'd guess it was something metal , like a blunt Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 163  | letter opener , or a metal ruler , or a screwdriver . Something like that . But what 's really interesting , " the doctor went on , " is this phenomenon here . " He pointed to the girl 's left arm , which was outstretched on the bed and mutilated badly by stab wounds . " You see , he stabbed her in the stomach , and then stabbed her arm , moving out in a regular way , a succession of stabbings . Now , notice : when he 's past the arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sheet and blanket . They continue out in a straight line . " He pointed to the tears . " Now , " the doctor said , " in my book that 's perseveration . Automatic continuation of pointless movement . Like he was some kind of machine that just kept going and going .... " " That 's correct , " Ross said . " We assume , " the doctor said , " that it represents some kind of trance state . But we do n't know if it was organic or functional , natural or artificially induced . Since the girl let him into the apartment freely , this trance-like state developed only later . " Ross realized that the coroner 's man was showing off , and it irritated her . This was the wrong time to be playing Sherlock Holmes . Anders handed her the metal dog tag . " We were proceeding routinely with the investigation , " he said , " when we found this . " Ross turned the tag over in her hand .

He watched her carefully . " We 've leveled with you , " he said . " Now it 's your turn . "  | " His name is Harry Benson , " she said . " He 's thirty-four and he has psychomotor epilepsy . " The doctor snapped his fingers . " I 'll be damned . " " What 's psychomotor epilepsy ? " Anders said . At that moment , a plainclothesman came in from the living room . " We got a trace on the prints , " he said . " They 're listed in the Defense data banks , of all places . This guy had classified clearance from 1968 to the present . His name 's Harry Benson , lives in L.A. " " Clearance for what ? " Anders said . " Computer work , probably , " Ross said . " That 's right , " the plainclothesman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anders was making notes . " They have a blood type on him ? " " Yeah . Type AO is what 's listed . " Ross turned to the doctor . " What do you have on the girl ? " " Name 's Doris Blankfurt , stage name Angela Black . Twenty-six years old , been in the building six weeks . " " What does she do ? " " Dancer . " Ross nodded . Anders said , " Does that have some special meaning ? " " He has a thing about dancers . " " He 's attracted to them ? " " Attracted and repelled , " she said . " It 's rather complicated . " He looked at her curiously . Did he think she was putting him on ? " And he has some kind of epilepsy ? " " Yes . Psychomotor epilepsy . " Anders made notes . " I 'm going to need some explanations , " he said .  | " Of course . " " And a description , pictures " I can get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She nodded . All her earlier impulses to resist the police , to refuse to cooperate with them , had vanished . She kept staring at the girl 's caved-in head . She could imagine the suddenness , the viciousness of the attack . She glanced at her watch . " It 's seven-thirty now , " she said . " I 'm going back to the hospital , but I 'm stopping at home to clean up and change . You can meet me there or at the hospital . " " I 'll meet you there , " Anders said . " I 'll be finished here in about twenty minutes . " " Okay , " she said , and gave him the address . The shower felt good , the hot water like stinging needles against her bare skin . She relaxed , breathed the steam , and closed her eyes . She had always liked showers , even though she knew it was the masculine pattern . Men took showers , women took baths . Dr. Ramos had mentioned that once . She thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was an individual . Then she 'd discovered that showers were used to treat schizophrenics . They were sometimes calmed by alternating hot and cold spray . " So now you think you 're schizophrenic ? " Dr. Ramos had said , and laughed heartily . He did n't often laugh . 166 THE TERMINAL MAN  | Sometimes she tried to make him laugh , usually without success . She turned off the shower and climbed out , pulling a towel around her . She wiped the steam off the bathroom mirror and stared at her reflection . " You look like hell , " she said , and nodded . Her reflection nodded back . The shower had washed away her eye make-up , the only makeup she wore . Her eyes seemed small now , and weak with fatigue . What time was her hour with Dr. Ramos today ? Was it today ? What day was it , anyway ? It took her a moment to remember that it was Friday . She had n't slept for at least twenty-four hours , and she was having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An acid gnawing in her stomach . A dull ache in her body . A kind of slow confusion of the mind . It was a terrible way to feel . She knew how it would progress . In another four or five hours , she would begin to daydream about sleeping . She would imagine a bed , and the softness of the mattress as she lay on it . She would begin to dwell on the wonderful sensations that would accompany falling asleep . She hoped they found Benson before long . The mirror had steamed over again . She opened the bathroom door to let cool air in , and wiped a clean space with her hand again . She was starting to apply fresh make-up when she heard the doorbell . That would be Anders . She had left the front door unlocked . " It 's open , " she shouted , and then returned to her make-up . She did one eye , then paused before the second . " If you want coffee , just boil water in the kitchen , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel tighter around her , and leaned out toward the hallway . " Find everything you need ? " she called . Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 167  | Harry Benson was standing in the hallway . " Good morning , Dr. Ross , " he said . His voice was pleasant . " I hope I have n't come at an inconvenient time . " It was odd how frightened she felt . He held out his hand and she shook it , hardly conscious of the action . She was preoccupied with her own fear . Why was she afraid ? She knew this man well ; she had been alone with him many times before , and had never been afraid . The surprise was part of it , the shock of finding him here . And the unprofessional setting : she was acutely aware of the towel , her still-damp bare legs . " Excuse me a minute , " she said , " and I 'll get some clothes on . " He nodded politely and went back to the living room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . She was breathing hard , as if she had run a great distance . Anxiety , she thought , but the label did n't really help . She remembered a patient who had finally shouted at her in frustration , " Do n't tell me I 'm depressed . I feel terrible ! " She went to the closet and pulled on a dress , hardly noticing which one it was . Then she went back into the bathroom to check her appearance . Stalling , she thought . This is not the time to stall . She took a deep breath and went outside to talk with him . He was standing in the middle of the living room , looking uncomfortable and confused . She saw the room freshly , through his eyes : a modern , sterile , hostile apartment . Modern furniture , black leather and chrome , hard lines ; modern paintings on the walls ; modern , glistening , machinelike , efficient , a totally hostile environment . " I never would have thought this of you , " he said . 168 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same things , Harry . " She kept her voice light . " Do you want some coffee ? " " No , thanks . " He was neatly dressed , in a jacket and tie , but his wig , the black wig , threw her off . Also his eyes : they were tired , distant the eyes of a man near the breaking point of fatigue . She remembered how the rats had collapsed from excessive pleasurable stimulation . Eventually they lay spread-eagled on the floor of the cage , panting , too weak to crawl forward and press the shock lever one more time . " Are you alone here ? " he said . " Yes , I am . " There was a small bruise on his left cheek , just below the eye . She looked at his bandages . They just barely showed , a bit of white between the bottom of his wig and the top of his collar . " Is something wrong ? " he asked . " No , nothing . " " You seem tense . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a stimulation . She remembered how he had become sexually interested in her after the test stimulations , just before he was interfaced . " No ... I 'm not tense . " She smiled . " You have a very nice smile , " he said . She glanced at his clothes , looking for blood . The girl had been soaked ; Benson must have been covered with blood , yet there was none on his clothes . Perhaps he 'd dressed after taking a second shower . After killing her . " Well , " she said , " I 'm going to have some coffee . " She went into the kitchen with a kind of relief . It was somehow easier to breathe in the kitchen , away from him . She put the kettle on the burner , turned on the gas , and stayed there a moment . She had to get control of herself . She had to get control of the situation . Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 169  | The odd thing was that while she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was not really surprised that he had come . Psychomotor epileptics were driven people , who feared their own violence . More than half of them attempted suicide in desperation ; all of them felt anguish and sought the help of doctors . But why had n't he returned to the hospital ? She went out to the living room . Benson was standing by the large windows , looking out over the city , which stretched away for miles in every direction . " Are you angry with me ? " he said . " Angry ? Why ? " " Because I ran away . " " Why did you run away , Harry ? " As she spoke , she felt her strength coming back , her control . She could handle this man . It was her job . She 'd been alone with men more dangerous than this . She remembered a six-month period at Cameron State Hospital , where she had worked with psychopaths and multiple murderers  --  charming , engaging , chilling men . " Why ? Because . " He smiled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , then stood up , sitting down again on the sofa . " All your furniture is so uncomfortable . How can you live in such an uncomfortable place ? " " I like it . " " But it 's uncomfortable . " He stared at her , a faint challenge in the look . She wished again that they were not meeting here . This environment was too threatening , and Benson reacted to threats with attack . " How did you find me , Harry ? " " You 're surprised I knew where you lived ? " " Yes , a little . " " I was careful , " he said . Before I went into the hospital , I found out where you lived , where Ellis lived , where 170 THE TERMINAL MAN  | McPherson lived . I found out where everybody lived . " " Why ? " " Just in case . " " What were you expecting ? " He did n't reply . Instead , he got up and walked to the windows , looked out over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Are n't they ? " " Yes . " " But they 'll never find me . The city is too big . " From the kitchen , her kettle began to whistle . She excused herself and went in to make coffee . Her eyes scanned the counter , seaching for something heavy . Perhaps she could hit him over the head . Ellis would never forgive her , but " You have a picture on your wall , " Benson called . " A lot of numbers . Who did that ? " " A man named Johns . " " Why would a man draw numbers ? Numbers are for machines . " She stirred the instant coffee , poured in milk , went back out and sat down . " Harry ... " " No , I mean it . And look at this . What is this supposed to mean ? " He tapped another picture with his knuckles . " Harry , come and sit down . " He stared at her for a moment , then came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense , but a moment later smiled in a relaxed way . For an instant , his pupils dilated . Another stimulation , she thought . What the hell was she going to do ? " Harry , " she said , " what happened ? " " I do n't know , " he said , still relaxed . " You left the hospital ... " Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 171  | " Yes , I left the hospital wearing one of those white suits . I figured it all out . Angela picked me up . " " And then ? " " And then we went to my house . I was quite tense . " " Why were you tense ? " " Well , you see , I know how this is all going to end . " She was n't sure what he was referring to . " How is it going to end ? " " And after we left my house , we went to her apartment , and we had some drinks , and we made love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . That was when she got scared . She wanted to call the hospital , to tell them where I was .... " He stared off into space , momentarily confused . She did n't want to press the point . He had had a seizure and he would not remember killing the girl . His amnesia would be total and genuine . But she wanted to keep him talking . " Why did you leave the hospital , Harry ? " " It was in the afternoon , " he said , turning to look at her . " I was lying in bed in the afternoon , and I suddenly realized that everybody was taking care of me , taking care , servicing me , like a machine . I was afraid of that all along . " In some distant , detached , and academic corner of her mind , she felt that a suspicion was confirmed . Benson 's paranoia about machines was , at bottom , a fear of dependency , of losing self-reliance . He was quite literally telling the truth when he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people usually hated what they feared . But then Benson was dependent on her . And how would he react to that ? " You people lied to me , " he said suddenly . " Nobody lied to you , Harry . "  | He began to get angry . " Yes , you did , you ? " He broke off and smiled again . The pupils were briefly larger : another stimulation . They were very close now . He 'd tip over again soon . " You know something ? That 's the most wonderful feeling in the world , " he said . " What feeling ? " " That buzz . " " Is that how it feels ? " " As soon as things start to get black buzz ! and I 'm happy again , " Benson said . " Beautifully warm and happy . " " The stimulations , " she said . She resisted the impulse to look at her watch . What did it matter ? Anders had said he would be coming in twenty minutes , but anything could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if he could handle Benson . A psychomotor epileptic out of control was an awesome thing . Anders would probably end up shooting Benson , or trying to . And she did n't want that . " But you know what else ? " Benson said . " The buzz is only nice occasionally . When it gets too heavy , it 's . . . suffocating . " " Is it getting heavy now ? " " Yes , " he said . And he smiled . In that moment when he smiled , she was stunned into the full realization of her own helplessness . Everything she had been taught about controlling patients , everything about directing the flow of thought , about watching the speech patterns , was useless here . Verbal maneuvers would not work , would not help her  --  any more than they would help control a rabies victim , or a person with a brain tumor . Benson had a physical problem . He was in the grip of a machine that was inexorably , flawlessly pushing him Friday , March 12 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't turn off the implanted computer . There was only one thing she could do , and that was get him to the hospital . How ? She tried an appeal to his intellectual functions . " Do you understand what 's happening , Harry ? The stimulations are overloading you , pushing you into seizures . " " The feeling is nice . " " But you said yourself it 's not always nice . " " No , not always . " " Well , do n't you want to have that corrected ? " He paused a moment . " Corrected ? " " Fixed . Changed so that you do n't have seizures any more . " She had to choose her words carefully . " You think I need to be fixed ? " His words reminded her of Ellis : the surgeon 's pet phrase . " Harry , we can make you feel better . " " I feel fine , Dr. Ross . " " But , Harry , when you went to Angela 's ? " " I do n't remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you left the hospital . " " I do n't remember anything . Memory tapes are all erased . Nothing but static . You can put it on audio if you want , and listen to it yourself . " He opened his mouth , and made a hissing sound . " See ? Just static . " " You 're not a machine , Harry , " she said softly . " Not yet . " Her stomach churned . She was physically sick with tension . Again that detached part of her mind noted the interesting physical manifestation of an emotional state . She was grateful for the detachment , even for a few instants of it . But she was also angry at the thought of Ellis and  | McPherson , and all those conferences when she had argued that implanting machinery into Benson would exaggerate his pre-existing delusional state . They had n't paid any attention . She wished they were here now . " You 're trying to make me into a machine , " he said . " You all are . I 'm fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His face was taut ; abruptly , it loosened into a smile . Another stimulation . They were coming only minutes apart now . Where was Anders ? Where was anybody ? Should she run out into the hall screaming ? Should she try to call the hospital ? The police ? " It feels so good , " Benson said , still smiling . " That feeling , it feels so good . Nothing feels as good as that . I could just swim in that feeling forever and ever . " " Harry . I want you to try and relax . " " I 'm relaxed . But that 's not what you really want , is it ? " " What do I want ? " " You want me to be a good machine . You want me to obey my masters , to follow instructions . Is n't that what you want ? " " You 're not a machine , Harry . " " And I never will be . " His smiled faded . " Never . Ever . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I want you to come back to the hospital . " " No . " " We can make you feel better . " " No . " " We care about you , Harry . " " You care about me . " He laughed , a nasty hard sound . " You do n't care about me . You care about your experimental preparation . You care about your scientific protoFriday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 175  | col . You care about your follow-up . You do n't care about me . " He was becoming excited and angry . " It wo n't look so good in the medical journals if you have to report so many patients observed for so many years , and one died because he went nuts and the cops killed him . That will reflect badly . " " Harry ? " " I know , " Benson said . He held out his hands . " I was sick an hour ago . Then , when I woke up , I saw blood under my fingernails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands , curling them to look at the nails . Then he touched his bandages . " The operation was supposed to work , " he said . " But it is n't working . " And then , quite abruptly , he began to cry . His face was bland , but the tears rolled down his cheeks . " It is n't working , " he said . " I do n't understand , it is n't working .... " Equally abruptly , he smiled . Another stimulation . This one had come less than a minute after the one previously . She knew that he 'd tip over in the next few seconds . " I do n't want to hurt anyone , " he said , smiling cheerfully . She felt sympathy for him , and sadness for what had happened . " I understand , " she said . " Let 's go back to the hospital . " " No , no ... " " I 'll go with you . I 'll stay with you all the time . It will be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He snapped to his feet , fists clenched , and glared down at her . " I will not listen ? " He broke off , but did not smile . Instead , he began to sniff the air . " What is that smell ? " he said . " I hate that smell . What is it ? I hate it , do you hear me , I hate it ! "  | He moved toward her , sniffing . He reached his hands out toward her . " Harry ... " " I hate this feeling , " he said . She got up off the couch , moving away . He followed her clumsily , his hands still outstretched . " I do n't want this feeling , I do n't want it , " he said . He was no longer sniffing . He was fully in a trance state , coming toward her . " Harry ... " His face was blank , an automaton mask . His arms were still extended toward her . He almost seemed to be sleepwalking as he advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to back away from him , maintaining distance . Then , suddenly , he picked up a heavy glass ashtray and flung it at her . She dodged ; it struck one of the large windows , shattering the glass . He leaped for her and threw his arms around her , holding her in a clumsy bear hug . He squeezed her with incredible strength . " Harry , " she gasped , " Harry . " She looked up at his face and saw it was still blank . She kneed him in the groin . He grunted and released her , bending at the waist , coughing . She moved away from him and picked up the phone . She dialed the operator . Benson was still bent over , still coughing . " Operator . " " Operator , give me the police . " " Do you want the Beverly Hills police , or the Los Angeles police ? " " I do n't care ! " " Well , which do you ? " She dropped the phone . Benson was stalking her again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " Hello , hello ... " Benson tore the phone away and flung it behind him across the room . He picked up a floor lamp and held it base outward . He began to swing it in large hissing arcs . She ducked it once and felt the gush of air in the wake of the heavy metal base . If it hit her , it would kill her . It would kill her . The realization pushed her to action . She ran to the kitchen . Benson dropped the lamp and followed her . She tore open drawers , looking for a knife . She found only a small paring knife . Where the hell were her big knives ? Benson was in the kitchen . She threw a pot at him blindly . It clattered against his knees . He moved forward . The detached and academic part of her mind was still operating , telling her that she was making a big mistake , that there was something in the kitchen she could use . But what ? Benson 's hands closed around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrists and tried to pull them away . She kicked up with her leg , but he twisted his body away from her , then pressed her back against the counter , pinning her down . She could not move , she could not breathe . She began to see blue spots dancing before her eyes . Her lungs burned for air . Her fingers scratched along the counter , feeling for something , anything , to strike him with . She touched nothing . The kitchen .. . She flung her hands around wildly . She felt the handle of the dishwasher , the handle to the oven , the machines in her kitchen . 178 THE TERMINAL MAN Her vision was greenish . The blue spots were larger . They swam sickeningly before her . She was going to die in the kitchen . The kitchen , the kitchen , dangers of the kitchen . It came to her in a flash , just as she was losing consciousness . Microwaves . She no longer had any vision ; the world was dull gray , but she could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the glass of the oven door , then up . . . up to the controls . . . she twisted the dial ... . Benson screamed . The pressure around her neck was gone . She slumped to the floor . Benson was screaming , horrible agonized sounds . Her vision came back to her slowly and she saw him , standing over her , clutching his head in his hands . Screaming . He paid no attention to her as she lay on the floor , gasping for breath . He twisted and writhed , holding his head and howling like a wounded animal . Then he rushed from the room , still screaming . And she slid smoothly and easily into unconsciousness . The bruises were already forming  --  long , purplish welts on both sides of her neck . She touched them gently as she looked into the mirror . " When did he leave ? " Anders said . He stood in the doorway to the bathroom , watching her . " I do n't know . Around the time I passed out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked back toward the living room . " Quite a mess out there . " " I imagine so . " " Why did he attack you ? " " He had a seizure . " " But you 're his doctor ? " " That does n't matter , " she said . " When he has a seizure , he 's out of control . Totally . He 'd kill his own child during a seizure . People have been known to do that . " Anders frowned uncertainly . She could imagine the trouble he was having with the idea . Unless you had seen a psychomotor seizure , you could not comprehend the unreasonable , brutal violence of an attack . It was completely beyond any normal life experience . Nothing else was like it , analogous to it , similar to it . " Umm , " Anders said finally . " But he did n't kill you . " Not quite , she thought , still touching the bruises . The bruises would get much worse in the next few hours . What could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any . A high-necked sweater ? " No , " she said , " he did n't kill me . But he would have . " " What happened ? " " I turned on the oven . " Anders looked puzzled . " Is that a cure for epilepsy ? " " Hardly . But it affected Benson 's electronic machinery . I have a microwave oven . Microwave radiation screws up pacemaking machinery . It 's a big problem for cardiac pacemakers now . Dangers of the kitchen . There have been a lot of recent articles . " " Oh , " Anders said . He left the room to make some calls , while she dressed . She chose a black turtleneck sweater and a gray skirt , and stepped back to look at herself in the mirror . The bruises were hidden . Then she noticed the colors , black and gray . 180 THE TERMINAL MAN  | That was n't like her . Too somber , too dead and cold . She considered changing , but did n't . She heard Anders talking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kitchen to make herself a drink ? no more coffee ; she wanted Scotch on the rocks  --  and as she poured it , she saw the long scratches in the wooden counter that her fingernails had left . She looked at her fingernails . Three of them were broken ; she had n't noticed before . She made the drink and went out to sit in the living room . " Yes , " Anders was saying into the phone . " Yes , I understand . No . . . no idea . Well , we 're trying . " There was a long pause . She went to the broken window and looked out at the city . The sun was up , lighting a dark band of brown air that hung above the buildings . It was really a lethal place to live , she thought . She should move to the beach where the air was better . " Well , listen , " Anders said angrily , " none of this would have happened if you 'd kept that fucking guard at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in mind . " She heard the phone slam down , and turned . " Shit , " he said . " Politics . " " Even in the police department ? " " Especially in the police department , " he said . " Anything goes wrong , and suddenly there 's a scramble to see who can get stuck with it . " " They 're trying to stick you ? " " They 're trying me on for size . " She nodded , and wondered what was happening back at the hospital . Probably the same thing . The hospital had to maintain its image in the community ; the chiefs of service would be in a sweat ; the director would be worrying Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 181  | about fund-raising . Somebody at the hospital would get stuck . McPherson was too big ; she and Morris were too small . It would probably be Ellis  --  he was an assistant professor . If you fired an assistant professor it had connotations of firing a temporary appointment who had proven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much better than firing a full professor , which was very messy and reflected badly on the earlier decision that had given him tenure . It would probably be Ellis . She wondered if he knew . He had just recently bought a new house in Brentwood . He was very proud of it ; he had invited everyone in the NPS to a housewarming party next week . She stared out the window , through the shattered glass . Anders said , " Listen , what does epilepsy have to do with cardiac pacemakers ? " " Nothing , " she said , " except that Benson has a brain pacemaker , very similar to a cardiac pacemaker . " Anders flipped open his notebook . " You better start from the beginning , " he said , " and go slowly . " " All right . " She set down her drink . " Let me make one call first . " Anders nodded , sat back , and waited while she called McPherson . Then , - as calmly as she could , she explained everything she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stared out his office window at the morning sun . It was no longer pale and cold ; there was the full warmth of morning . " That was Ross , " he said . Morris nodded from the corner . " And ? " " Benson came to her apartment . She lost him . " Morris sighed . " It does n't seem to be our day , " McPherson said . He shook his head , not taking his eyes off the sun . " I do n't believe in luck , " he said . He turned to Morris . " Do you ? " Morris was tired ; he had n't really been listening . " Do I what ? " " Believe in luck . " " Sure . All surgeons believe in luck . " " I do n't believe in luck , " McPherson repeated . " Never did . I always believed in planning . " He gestured to the charts on his wall , then lapsed , staring at them . The charts were large things , four feet across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really glorified flow charts with timetables for technical advances . He had always been proud of them . For instance , in 1967 he had examined the state of three areas  --  diagnostic conceptualization , surgical technology , and microelectronics  --  and concluded that they would all come together to allow an operation for psychomotor epilepsy in July of 1971 . They had beaten his estimate by four months , but it was still damned accurate . Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 183  | " Damned accurate , " he said . " What ? " Morris said . McPherson shook his head . " Are you tired ? " " Yes . " " I guess we 're all tired . Where 's Ellis ? " " Making coffee . " McPherson nodded . Coffee would be good . He rubbed his eyes , wondering when he would be able to sleep . Not for a while  --  not until they had Benson back . And that could take many hours more , perhaps another day . He looked again at the charts . Everything had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule . Computer simulation of behavior almost nine months ahead  --  but that , too , was having problems . George and Martha programs were behaving erratically . And Form Q ? He shook his head . Form Q might never get off the ground now , although it was his favorite project , and had always been . Form Q on the flow chart for 1979 , with human application beginning in 1986 . In 1986 he would be seventy-five years old  --  if he was still alive  --  but he did n't worry about that . It was the idea , the simple idea , that intrigued him . Form Q was the logical outgrowth of all the work at the NPS . It began as a project called Form Quixoticus , because it seemed so impossible . But McPherson felt certain that it would happen because it was so necessary . For one thing , it was a question of size ; for another , a question of expense . A modern electronic computer  --  say , a third-generation IBM digital computer  --  would cost several million dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumed space voraciously . Yet the largest computer still had the same number of circuits as the brain of an ant . To make a corn-  | puter with the capacity of a human brain would require a huge skyscraper . Its energy demands would be the equivalent of a city of half a million . Obviously , nobody would ever try to build such a computer using current technology . New methods would have to be found  --  and there was n't much doubt in McPherson 's mind what the methods would be . Living tissues . The theory was simple enough . A computer , like a human brain , was composed of functioning units little flipflop cells of one kind or another . The size of those units had shrunk considerably over the years . They would continue to shrink as large-scale integration and other microelectronic techniques improved . Power requirements would also decrease . But the individual units would never become as small as a nerve cell , a neuron . You could pack a billion nerve cells into one cubic inch . No human miniaturization method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any human method ever produce a unit that operated on so little power as a nerve cell . Therefore , make your computers from living nerve cells . It was already possible to grow isolated nerve cells in tissue culture . It was possible to alter them artificially in different ways . In the future , it would be possible to grow them to specification , to make them link up in specified ways . Once you could do that , you could make a computer that was , say , six cubic feet in volume , but contained thousands of billions of nerve cells . Its energy requirements would not be excessive ; its heat production and waste products would be manageable . Yet it would be the most intelligent entity on the planet , by far . Form Q. Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 185  | Preliminary work was already being done in a number of laboratories and government research units around the . country . Advances were being made . But for McPherson the most exciting prospect was not a superintelligent organic computer . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the idea of an organic prosthesis for the human brain . Because once you developed an organic computer  --  a computer composed of living cells , and deriving energy from oxygenated , nutrified blood  --  then you could transplant it into a human being . And you would have a man with two brains . What would that be like ? McPherson could hardly imagine it . There were endless problems , of course . Problems of interconnection , problems of location , speculative problems about competition between the old brain and the new transplant . But there was plenty of time to solve that before 1986 . After all , in 1950 most people still laughed at the idea of going to the moon . Form Q. It was only a vision now , but with funding it would happen . And he had been convinced that it would happen , until Benson left the hospital . That changed everything . Ellis stuck his head in the office door . " Anybody want coffee ? " " Yes , " McPherson said . He looked over at Morris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his chair . " I think I 'll replay some of Benson 's interview tapes . " " Good idea , " McPherson said , though he did not really think so . He realized that Morris had to keep busy had to do something , anything , just to remain active . Morris left , Ellis left , and McPherson was alone with his multicolored charts , and his thoughts .  | It was noon when Ross finished with Anders , and she was tired . The Scotch had calmed her , but it had intensified her fatigue . Toward the end she had found herself stumbling over words , losing track of her thoughts , making statements and then amending them because they were not exactly what she had intended to say . She had never felt so tired , so drugged with fatigue , in her life . Anders , on the other hand , was maddeningly alert . He said , " Where do you suppose Benson is now ? Where would he be likely to go ? " She shook her head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-seizure state  --  post-ictal , we call it  --  and that 's not predictable . " " You 're his psychiatrist , " Anders said . " You must know a lot about him . Is n't there any way to predict how he 'll act ? " " No , " she said . God , she was tired . Why could n't he understand ? " Benson is in an abnormal state . He 's nearly psychotic , he 's confused , he 's receiving stimulations frequently , he 's having seizures frequently . He could do anything . " " If he 's confused ... " Anders let his voice trail off . " What would he do if he was confused ? How would he behave ? " " Look , " she said , " it 's no good . It 's no damned good , working that way . He could do anything . " " Okay , " Anders said . He glanced at her briefly , and sipped his coffee . Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 187  | Why could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake ? His desire to psych out Benson and track him down was ludicrously unrealistic . Besides , everybody knew how this was going to turn out . Somebody would spot Benson and shoot him , and that would be the end of it . Even Benson had said She paused , frowning . What had he said ? Something about how it would all end . What were his exact words ? She tried to remember , but could n't . She had been too frightened to pay close attention . " These are the impossible ones , " Anders said , getting up and walking to the window . " In another city , you might have a chance , but not in Los Angeles . Not in five hundred square miles of city . It 's bigger than New York , Chicago , San Francisco , and Philadelphia put together . Did you know that ? " " No , " she said , hardly listening . " Too many places to hide , " he said . " Too many ways to escape  --  too many roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's smart , he 's left already . Gone to Mexico or to Canada . " " He wo n't do that , " she said . " What will he do ? " " He 'll come back to the hospital . " There was a pause . " I thought you could n't predict his behavior , " Anders said . " It 's just a feeling , " she said , " that 's all . " " We 'd better go to the hospital , " he said . The NPS looked like the planning room for a war . All patient visits had been canceled until Monday ; no one but staff and police were admitted to the fourth floor . But for some reason , all the Development people were 188 THE TERMINAL MAN  | there , and they were running around with horrified looks on their faces , obviously worried that their grants and their jobs were in jeopardy . Phones rang constantly ; reporters were calling in ; McPherson was locked in his office with hospital administrators ; Ellis was swearing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was off somewhere and could n't be found ; Gerhard and Richards were trying to free some telephone lines so they could run a projection program using another computer , but all the lines were in use . Physically , the NPS was a shambles  --  ashtrays heaped with cigarette butts , coffee cups crumpled on the floor , half-eaten hamburgers and tacos everywhere , jackets and uniforms thrown across the backs of chairs . And the telephones never stopped ringing : as soon as anyone hung up on a call , the phone rang again instantly . Ross sat with Anders in her office and went over the Miscellaneous Crime Report , checking the description of Benson . The description was computerized , but it read out fairly accurately : male Caucasian black hair brown eyes 5 ' 8 " 140# 34 years old . Personal oddities : 312/3 wig , and 319/1 bandages on neck . Thought to be armed with : 40/11 revolver . Trademarks : 23/60 abnormal act ( other ) ? perseveration . Reason for crime : 23/86 suspect insane . Ross sighed . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody does , " Anders said . " All we can hope is that it 's accurate enough to allow somebody to identify him . We 're also circulating his picture . Several hundred photos are being run off now , and distributed around the city . That 'll help . " " What happens now ? " Ross said . 192 THE TERMINAL MAN " We wait , " he said . " Unless you can think of a hiding i place he 'd use . " She shook her head . " Then we wait , " he said .  | " We wait , " he said . " Unless you can think of a hiding place he 'd use . " She shook her head . " Then we wait , " he said . It was a broad , low-ceilinged , white-tiled room , lit brightly by overhead fluorescent lights . Six stainlesssteel tables were set out in a row , each emptying into a sink at one end of the room . Five of the tables were empty ; the body of Angela Black lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent over the body as the autopsy proceeded . Morris had seen a lot of autopsies in his day , but the autopsies he attended as a surgeon were usually different . In this one , the pathologists spent nearly half an hour examining the exterior appearance of the body and taking photographs before they made the initial incision . They paid a lot of attention to the external appearance of the stab wounds , and what they called a " stretch laceration " appearance to the wounds . One of the pathologists explained that this means the wounds were caused by a blunt object . It did n't cut the skin ; it pulled it and caused a split in the taut portion . Then the instrument went in , but the initial split was always slightly ahead of the deeper penetration track . They also pointed out that skin hair had been forced down into the wounds in several places  --  further evidence of a blunt object producing the cuts .  | " What kind of blunt object ? " Morris had asked . They shook their heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a look at the penetration . " Penetration meant the depth that the weapon had entered the body . Determining penetration was difficult ; skin was elastic and tended to snap back into shape ; underlying tissues moved around before and after death . It was a slow business . Morris was tired . His eyes hurt . After a time , he left the autopsy room and went next door to the police lab , where the girl 's purse contents were spread out on a large table . Three men went through it : one identifying the objects , one recording them , and the third tagging them . Morris watched in silence . Most of the objects seemed commonplace : lipstick , compact , car keys , wallet , Kleenex , chewing gum , birth control pills , address book , ball-point pen , eye shadow , hair clip . And two packs of matches . " Two packs of matches , " one of the cops intoned . " Both marked Airport Marina Hotel . " Morris sighed . They were going through this so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the autopsy . Did they really think they 'd find anything this way ? He found the plodding routine intolerable . Janet Ross called that the surgeon 's disease , this urge to take decisive action , the inability to wait patiently . Once in an early NPS conference where they were considering a stage-three candidate  --  a woman named Worley  --  Morris had argued strongly for taking her as a surgical candidate , even though she had several other problems . Ross had laughed ; " poor impulse control , " she had said . In that moment , he could cheerfully have killed her , and his murderous feelings were not relieved when Ellis then said , in a clinical , quiet tone , that he agreed that Mrs. Worley was an inappropriate surgical candidate . Morris felt let down in the worst way , even 194 THE TERMINAL MAN  | though McPherson said that he thought the candidate had some worth , and probably should be listed as a " possible " and held for a while . Poor impulse control , he thought . The hell with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cops said . " Is n't that where all the stewardesses stay ? " " I du n no , " the other cop said . Morris hardly listened . He rubbed his eyes and decided to get more coffee . He 'd been awake for thirty-six hours straight , and he was n't going to last much longer . He left the room and went upstairs looking for a coffee machine . There must be coffee someplace in the building . Even cops drank coffee ; everybody drank coffee . And then he stopped , shivering . He knew something about the Airport Marina . The Airport Marina was where Benson had first been arrested , on suspicion of beating up a mechanic . There was a bar in the hotel ; it had happened there . Morris was sure of it . He glanced at his watch and then went out to the parking lot . If he hurried , he 'd beat rush-hour traffic to the airport . A jet screamed overhead and descended toward the runway as Morris took the airport off-ramp from the freeway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motels and car-rental offices . On the radio , he heard the announcer drone : " And on the San Diego Freeway , there is an accident involving a truck blocking three northbound lanes . Computer projection of flow is twelve miles an hour . On the San Bernadino Freeway , a stalled car in the left lane south of the Exeter off-ramp . Computer Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 195  | projection of traffic flow is thirty-one miles an hour ... Morris thought of Benson again . Perhaps computers really were taking over . He remembered a funny little Englishman who had lectured at the hospital and told the surgeons that soon operations would be done with the surgeon on another continent  --  he would work using robot hands , the signals being transmitted via satellite . The idea had seemed crazy , but his surgical colleagues had squirmed at the thought . " On the Ventura Freeway west of Haskell , a two-car collision has slowed traffic . Computer projection is eighteen miles an hour . " He found himself listening to the traffic report intently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone who lived in Los Angeles . You learned to pay attention to any traffic report automatically , the way people in other parts of the country automatically paid attention to weather reports . Morris had come to California from Michigan . For the first few weeks after his arrival , he had asked people what the weather was going to be like later in the day , or on the following day . It seemed to him a natural question for a newcomer to ask , and a natural ice breaker . But he got very strange , puzzled looks from people . Later he realized that he had come to one of the few places in the world where the weather was of no interest to anyone  --  it was always more or less the same , and rarely discussed . But automobiles ! Now there was a subject of almost compulsive fascination . People were always interested in what kind of car you drove , how you liked it , whether it was reliable , what troubles you had had with it . In the same vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , accidents you had experienced , were always 196 THE TERMINAL MAN  | welcome conversation topics . In Los Angeles , anything relating to cars was a serious matter , worthy of as much time and attention as you could devote to it . He remembered , as a kind of final proof of the idiocy of it all , that an astronomer had once said that if Martians looked at Los Angeles , they would probably conclude that the automobile was the dominant life form of the area . And , in a sense , they would be right . He parked in the lot of the Airport Marina Hotel and entered the lobby . The building was as incongruous as its name , with that California quality of bizarre mixtures ? in this case , a sort of plastic-and-neon Japanese inn . He went directly to the bar , which was dark and nearly deserted at 5 p.m . There were two stewardesses in a far corner , talking over drinks ; one or two businessmen seated at the bar ; and the bartender himself , staring off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the bartender came over , he pushed Benson 's picture across the counter . " You ever seen this man ? " " What 'll it be ? " the bartender said . Morris tapped the picture . " This is a bar . We serve liquor . " Morris was beginning to feel strange . It was the kind of feeling he sometimes had when he began an operation and felt like a surgeon in a movie . Something very theatrical . Now he was a private eye . " His name is Benson , " Morris said . " I 'm his doctor . He 's very ill . " " What 's he got ? " Morris sighed . " Have you seen him before ? "  | " Sure , lots of times . Harry , right ? " " That 's right . Harry Benson . When was the last time you saw him ? " " An hour ago . " The man shrugged . " What 's he got ? " " Epilepsy . It 's important to find him . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit . " The bartender picked up the picture and examined it closely in the light of a glowing Schlitz sign behind the bar . " That 's him , all right . But he dyed his hair black . " " Do you know where he went ? " " He did n't look sick to me . Are you sure you 're ? " " Do you know where he went ? " There was a long silence . The bartender ' looked grim . Morris instantly regretted his tone . " You 're no fucking doctor , " the bartender said . " Now beat it . " " I need your help , " Morris said . " Time is very important . " As he spoke , he opened his wallet , took out his identification cards , credit cards , everything with an M.D. on it . He spread them across the counter . The bartender did n't even glance at them . " He is also wanted by the police , " Morris said . " I knew it , " the bartender said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get some policemen down here to help question you . You may be an accessory to murder . " Morris thought that sounded good . At least it sounded dramatic . The bartender picked up one of the cards , peered at it , dropped it . " I do n't know nothing , " he said . " He comes in sometimes , that 's all . " " Where did he go today ? " " I do n't know . He left with Joe . " " Who 's Joe ? " " Mechanic . Works the late shift at United . " 198 THE TERMINAL MAN  | " United Air Lines ? " " That 's right , " the bartender said . " Listen , what about this ? " But Morris was already gone . In the hotel lobby , he called the NPS and got through the switchboard to Captain Anders . " Anders here . " " Listen , this is Morris . I 'm at the airport . I have a lead on Benson . About an hour ago , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He left with a mechanic named Joe who works for United . Works the evening shift . " There was a moment of silence . Morris heard the scribbling sound of a pencil . " Got it , " Anders said . " Anything else ? " " No . " " We 'll get some cars out right away . You think he went to the United hangars ? " " Probably . " " We 'll get some cars out right away . " " What about ? " Morris stopped , and stared at the receiver . It was dead in his hand . He took a deep breath and tried to decide what to do next . From now on , it was police business . Benson was dangerous . He should let the police handle it . On the other hand , how long would it take them to get here ? Where was the nearest police station ? Inglewood ? Culver City ? In rush hour traffic , even with their sirens it might take twenty minutes . It might take half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in half an hour . Meanwhile , he ought to keep track of him . Just locate Benson , and keep track of him . Not interfere . But not let him get away , either .  | The large sign said UNITED AIR LINES  --  MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL ONLY . There was a guardhouse beneath the sign . Morris pulled up , leaned out of his car . " I 'm Dr. Morris . I 'm looking for Joe . " Morris was prepared for a lengthy explanation . But the guard did n't seem to care . " Joe came on about ten minutes ago . Signed in to hangar seven . " Ahead of him , Morris saw three very large airplane hangars , with parking lots behind . " Which one is seven ? " " Far left , " the guard said . " Do n't know why he went there , except maybe the guest . " " What guest ? " " He signed in a guest .... " The guard consulted his clipboard . " A Mr. Benson . Took him to seven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DC-10 that 's in for major overhaul . Nothing doing there  --  they 're waiting for a new engine . It 'll be another week in there . Guess he wanted to show it to him . " " Thanks , " Morris said . He drove past the gates , onto the parking lot , and parked close to hangar seven . He got out of the car , then paused . The fact was , he really did n't know whether Benson was in the hangar or not . He ought to check that . Otherwise , when the police arrived he might appear a fool . He might sit here in this parking lot while Benson escaped . He thought he 'd better check . He was not afraid . He was young and in good physical condition . He was also fully aware that Benson was dangerous . That foreknowledge would protect him . Benson was most dangerous to those who did n't recognize the lethal nature of his illness . He decided to take a quick look inside the hangar to make sure Benson was inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't seem to have any doors , except for the giant doors to admit the airplane . They were now closed . How did you get in ? He scanned the exterior of the building , which was mostly corrugated steel . Then he saw a normal-sized door to the far left . He got back in his car and drove up to it , parked , and entered the hangar . It was pitch black inside . And totally silent . He stood by the door for a moment , then heard a low groan . He ran his hands along the walls , feeling for a light switch . He touched a steel box , felt it carefully . There were several large heavy-duty switches . He threw them . One by one , the overhead lights came on , very bright and very high . He saw in the center of the hangar a giant plane , glinting with reflections from the overhead bulbs . It was odd how much more enormous it seemed inside a building . He walked toward it , away from the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not determine where it was coming from . There was no one in sight ; the floor was bare . But there was a ladder near the far wing . He walked beneath the high sleek tail assembly toward the ladder . The hangar smelled of gasoline and grease , sharp smells . It was warm . Another groan . He walked faster , his footsteps echoing in the cavernous hangar space . The groan seemed to be coming from somewhere inside the airplane . How did you get inside ? It was an odd thought : he 'd made dozens of airplane trips . You always got on by a ramp near the cockpit . But here , in the hangar . . . the plane was so damned enormous , how could you possibly get inside ? He passed the two jet engines of the near wing . They  | were giant cylinders , black turbine blades inside . Funny the engines had never seemed so big before . Probably never noticed . There was still another groan . He reached the ladder and climbed up . Six feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gleaming expanse of flat silver , nubbled with rivets . A sign said STEP HERE . There were drops of blood by the sign . He looked across the wing and saw a man covered with blood lying on his back . Morris moved closer and saw that the man 's face was horribly mangled , and his arm was twisted back at a grotesquely unnatural angle . He heard a noise behind him . He spun . And then , suddenly , all the lights in the hangar went out . Morris froze . He had a sense of total disorientation , of being suspended in air in vast and limitless blackness . He did not move . He held his breath . He waited . The injured man groaned again . There was no other sound . Morris knelt down , not really knowing why . Somehow he felt safer being close to the metal surface of the wing . He was not conscious of being afraid , just badly confused . Then he heard a soft laugh . And he began to be afraid . " Benson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you there ? " No reply . But footsteps , moving across the concrete floor . Steady , quietly echoing footsteps . " Harry , it 's Dr. Morris . " Morris blinked his eyes , trying to adjust to the darkness .  | It was no good . He could n't see anything . He could n't see the edges of the wing ; he could n't see the outline of the fuselage . He could n't see a fucking thing . The footsteps came closer . " Harry , I want to help you . " His voice cracked as he spoke . That certainly conveyed his fear to Benson . He decided to shut up . His heart was pounding , and he was breathing hard , gasping for breath . " Harry ... " No reply . But the footsteps stopped . Perhaps Benson was giving up . Perhaps he had had a stimulation . Perhaps he was changing his mind . A new sound : a metallic creak . Quite close . Another creak . He was climbing the ladder . Morris was drenched with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . He was so disoriented he no longer remembered where he was on the wing . Was the ladder in front of him or behind ? Another creak . He tried to fix the sound . It was coming somewhere in front of him . That meant he was facing the tail , the rear of the wing . Facing the ladder . Another creak . How many steps were there ? Roughly six feet , six steps . Benson would be standing on the wing soon . What could he use for a weapon ? Morris patted his pockets . His clothes were soaked and clinging with sweat . He had a momentary thought that this was all ridiculous , that Benson was the patient and he was the doctor . Benson would listen to reason . Benson would do as he was told . Another creak . A shoe ! Quickly , he slipped off his shoe , and cursed the fact that it had a rubber sole . But it was better than nothFriday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 203  | ing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ready to swing . He had a mental image of the beaten mechanic , the disfigured , bloody face . And he suddenly realized that he was going to have to hit Benson very hard , with all the strength he had . He was going to have to try to kill Benson . There were no more creaking sounds , but he could hear breathing . And then , distant at first but growing rapidly louder , he heard sirens . The police were coming . Benson would hear them , too , and would give up . Another creak . Benson was going back down the ladder . Morris breathed a sigh of relief . Then he heard a peculiar scratching sound and felt the wing beneath his feet shake . Benson had not climbed down . He had continued to climb up , and was now standing on the wing . " Dr. Morris ? " Morris almost answered , but did n't . He knew then that Benson could n't really see , either . Benson needed a voice fix . Morris said nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The sirens were louder each moment . Morris had a momentary elation at the thought that Benson was going to be caught . This whole nightmare would soon be over . " Please help me , Dr. Morris . " Perhaps he was sincere , Morris thought . Perhaps he really meant it . If that were so , then as his doctor he had a duty to help him . " Please ? " Morris stood . " I 'm over here , Harry , " he said . " Now , just take it easy and ? " Something hissed in the air . He felt it coming before it hit . Then he felt agonizing pain in his mouth and jaw , and 204 THE TERMINAL MAN  | he was knocked backward , rolling across the wing . The pain was awful , worse than anything he had ever felt . And then he fell into blackness . It was not far to fall from the wing to the ground . But it seemed to be taking a long time . It seemed to take forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward , watching through the small glass window . There were six people in there taking care of Morris , all clustered around him . She could n't see much . All she could really see were his feet . He had one shoe on ; the other was off . There was a lot of blood ; most of the EW people were spattered with it . Standing outside with her , Anders said , " I do n't have to tell you what I think of this . " " No , " she said . " The man is terribly dangerous . Dr. Morris should have waited for the police . " " But the police did n't catch him , " she said , suddenly angry . Anders did n't understand anything . He did n't understand how you could feel responsible for a patient , how you could want to take care of somebody . " Morris did n't catch him , either , " Anders said . " And why did n't the police get him ? " " Benson was gone when they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangar , and they could n't all be covered . They found Morris under the wing and the meFriday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 205  | chanic on top of the wing , and they were both pretty badly hurt . " The treatment-room door opened . Ellis came out , looking haggard , unshaven , defeated . " How is he ? " Ross said . " He 's okay , " Ellis said . " He wo n't have much to say for a few weeks , but he 's okay . They 're taking him to surgery now , to wire up his jaw and get all the teeth out . " He turned to Anders . " Did they find the weapon ? " Anders nodded . " Two-foot section of lead pipe . " " He must have got it right in the mouth , " Ellis said . " But at least he did n't inhale any of the loose teeth . The bronchi are clean on lung films . " He put his arm around Janet . " They 'll fix him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The mechanic ? " Ellis shook his head . " I would n't place bets . His nose was shattered and the nasal bones were driven up into the substance of the brain . He 's leaking CSF through the nostrils . Lot of bleeding and a big problem with encephalitis . " Anders said , " How do you assess his chances ? " " He 's on the critical list . " " All right , " Anders said . He walked off . Ross walked with Ellis out of the emergency ward toward the cafeteria . Ellis kept his arm around her shoulders . " This has turned into a horrible mess , " he said . " Will he really be all right ? " " Sure . " " He was kind of good-looking .... " " They 'll get his jaw back together . He 'll be fine . " She shuddered . " Cold ? " " Cold , " she said , " and tired . Very tired . " 206 THE TERMINAL MAN  | She had coffee with Ellis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of staff people eating . Ellis ate slowly , his movements showing fatigue . " It 's funny , " he said . " What ? " " I had a call this afternoon from Minnesota . They have a professorship in neurosurgery to fill . Asked me if I was interested . " She did n't say anything . " Is n't that funny ? " " No , " she said . " I told them I was n't considering anything until I was fired here , " he said . " Are you sure that 'll happen ? " " Are n't you ? " he said . He stared across the cafeteria at all the nurses and interns and residents in white . " I would n't like Minnesota , " he said . " It 's too cold . " " But it 's a good school . " " Oh , yes . A good school . " He sighed . " A fine school . " She felt sorry for him , and then suppressed the emotion . He had brought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last twenty-four hours , she had not allowed herself to say " I told you so " to anyone ; she had not allowed herself to think it . For one thing , it was n't necessary to say it . For another , it would not be useful in helping Benson , which was her chief concern . But she did n't have much sympathy now for the brave surgeon . Brave surgeons risked other people 's lives , not their own . The most a surgeon could lose was his reputation . " Well , " he said , " I better get back to the NPS . See how things are going . You know what ? " Friday , March 12 , 1971 ; Breakdown 207  | " What ? " " I hope they kill him , " Ellis said . And he walked away toward the elevators . The operation began at 7 p.m . She watched from the overhead glass viewing booth as Morris was wheeled into the OR , and the surgeons draped him . Bendixon and Curtiss were doing the procedure ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up as well as anybody possibly could . But it was still a shock to watch as the sterile gauze packs were taken away from Morris 's face and the flesh exposed . The upper part of his face was normal , though pale . The lower part was a red mash , like butcher 's meat . It was impossible to find the mouth in all the redness . Ellis had seen that in the emergency ward . It was shocking to her now , even at a distance . She could imagine the effect much closer . She stayed to watch as the drapes were placed over the body , and around the head . The surgeons were gowned and gloved ; the instrument tables set in position ; the scrub nurses stood ready . The whole ritual of preparing for surgery was carried out smoothly and efficiently . It was a wonderful ritual , she thought , so rigid and so perfect that nobody would ever know  --  and the surgeons themselves probably did n't consider  --  that they were operating on a colleague . The ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as gas was anaesthetic for the patient . She stayed a few moments longer , and then left the room .  | As she approached the NPS , she saw that a cluster of reporters had cornered Ellis outside the building . He was answering their questions in clear bad humor ; she heard the words " mind control " repeated several times . Feeling slightly guilty , she cut around to the far entrance and took the elevator to the fourth floor . Mind control , she thought . The Sunday supplements were going to have a field day with mind control . And then there would be solemn editorials in the daily papers , and even more solemn editorials in the medical journals , about the hazards of uncontrolled and irresponsible research . She could see it coming . Mind control . Christ . The truth was that everybody 's mind was controlled , 1 and everybody was glad for it . The most powerful mind controllers in the world were parents , and they did the most damage . Theorists usually forgot that nobody was born prejudiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping hand . Of course , parents did n't intentionally damage their children . They merely inculcated attitudes that they felt would be important and useful to their children . Newborn children were little computers waiting to be programmed . And they would learn whatever they were taught , from bad grammar to bad attitudes . Like computers , they were undiscriminating ; they had no way to Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 209  | differentiate between good ideas and bad ones . The analogy was quite exact : many people had remarked on the childishness and the literalness of computers . For example , if you could instruct a computer to " Put on your shoes and socks , " the computer would certainly reply that socks could not be fitted over shoes . All the important programming was finished by the age of seven . Racial attitudes , sexual attitudes , ethical attitudes , religious attitudes , national attitudes . The gyroscope was set , and the children let loose to spin off on their predetermined courses . Mind control . What about something as simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet someone ? Facing forward in elevators ? Passing on the left ? Having your wineglass on the right ? Hundreds of little conventions that people needed in order to stereotype social interaction take away any of them , and you produce unbearable anxiety . People needed mind control . They were glad to have it . They were hopelessly lost without it . But let a group of people try to solve the greatest problem in the world today  --  uncontrolled violence  --  and suddenly there are shouts from all sides : mind control , mind control ! Which was better , control or uncontrol ? She got off at the fourth floor , brushed past several policemen in the hallway , and went into her office . Anders was there , hanging up the telephone . And frowning . " We just got our first break , " he said . " Oh ? " Her irritation dissipated in a wave of expectancy . " Yes , " Anders said , " but I 'll be damned if I know what it means . "  | " What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being circulated downtown , and somebody recognized him . " " Who ? " " A clerk in Building and Planning , in City Hall . He said Benson came in ten days ago . Building and Planning files specifications on all public structures erected within city limits , and they administer certain building codes . " Ross nodded . " Well , Benson came in to check specs on a building . He wanted to review electrical blueprints . Said he was an electrical engineer , produced some identification . " Ross said , " The girls at his house said he 'd come back for some blueprints . " " Well , apparently he got them from Building and Planning . " " What are they for ? " " University Hospital , " Anders said . " He has the complete wiring system for the entire hospital . Now what do you make of that ? " They stared at each other . By eight o'clock , she was almost asleep standing up . Her neck was hurting badly , and she had a headache . She realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either she got some sleep , or she 'd pass out . " I 'll be on the floor if you need me , " she told Anders , and left . She walked down the corridor of the NPS , past several uniformed cops . She no longer noticed them ; it seemed as if there had always been cops in the hallways for as long as she could remember . She looked into McPherson 's office . He was sitting behind his desk , head on his shoulder , sleeping . His breath Friday , March 12 , 1971 : Breakdown 211  | came in short , ragged gasps . It sounded as if he were having nightmares . She closed the door quietly . An orderly walked past her , carrying filled ashtrays and empty coffee cups . It was strange to see an orderly doing cleaning duties . The sight triggered a thought in her mind ? something unusual , some question she could n't quite formulate . It nagged at her mind , but she finally gave up on it . She was tired ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treatment rooms and saw that it was empty . She went in , closed the door , and lay down on the examination couch . She was almost instantly asleep . In the lounge , Ellis watched himself on the 11-o'clock news . It was partly vanity and partly morbid curiosity that made him do it . Gerhard was also there , and Richards , and the cop Anders . On the screen , Ellis squinted slightly into the camera as he answered the questions of a group of reporters . Microphones were jammed up toward his face , but he seemed to himself calm . That pleased him . And he found his answers reasonable . The reporters asked him about the operation , and he explained it briefly but clearly . Then one asked , " Why was this operation done ? " " The patient , " Ellis answered , " suffers from intermittent attacks of violent behavior , He has organic brain disease ? 214 THE TERMINAL MAN  | thing . I think it 's a noble goal and an important goal . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you call compulsory education through high school ? " " Education , " the reporter said . And that ended the interview . Ellis got up angrily . " That makes me look like a fool , " he said . " No , it does n't , " Anders , the cop , said .  | She was being pounded , beaten senseless by brutal , jarring blows . She rolled away and moaned . " Come on , " Gerhard said , shaking her . " Wake up , Jan . " She opened her eyes . The room was dark . Someone was leaning over her . " Come on , come on , wake up . " She yawned . The movement sent streaks of pain down through her neck . " What is it ? " " Telephone for you . It 's Benson . " That jolted her awake faster than she would have thought possible . Gerhard helped her sit up , and she shook her head to clear it . Her neck was a column of pain , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ignored that . " Where ? " " Telecomp . " She went outside into the hallway , blinking in the bright light . The cops were still there , but they were tired now , eyes dulled , jaws slack . She followed Gerhard into Telecomp . Richards held out the phone to her , saying , " Here she is . She took the receiver . " Hello ? Harry ? " Across the room , Anders was listening on an extension . " I do n't feel good , " Harry Benson said . " I want it to stop , Dr. Ross . " 218 THE TERMINAL MAN  | " What 's the matter , Harry ? " She could hear the fatigue in his voice , the slow and slightly childlike quality . What would one of those rats say after twenty-four hours of stim-ulation ? " Things are n't working very well . I 'm tired . " " We can help you , " she said . " It 's the feelings , " Benson said . " They 're making me tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want them to stop . " " You 'll have to let us help you , Harry . " " I do n't believe you will . " " You have to trust us , Harry . " There was a long pause . Anders looked across the room at Ross . She shrugged . " Harry ? " she said . " I wish you never did this to me , " Benson said . Anders checked his watch . " Did what ? " " The operation . " " We can fix it for you , Harry . " " I wanted to fix it myself , " he said . His voice was very childlike , almost petulant . " I wanted to pull out the wires . " Ross frowned . " Did you try ? " " No . I tried to pull off the bandages , but it hurt too much . I do n't like it when it hurts . " He was really being quite childlike . She wondered if the regression was a specific phenomenon , or the result of fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull ? " " But I have to do something , " Benson said . " I have to stop this feeling . I 'm going to fix the computer . " " Harry , you ca n't do that . We have to do that for you . " " No . I 'm going to fix it . " " Harry , " she said , in a low , soothing , maternal voice . " Harry , please trust us . " There was no reply . Breathing on the other end of the  | line . She looked around the room at the tense , expectant faces . " Harry , please trust us . Just this once . Then everything will be all right . " " The police are looking for me . " " There are no police here , " she said . " They 've all gone . You can come here . Everything will be all right . " " You lied to me before , " he said . His voice was petulant again . " No , Harry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , everything will be all right . " There was a very long silence , and then a sigh . " I 'm sorry , " Benson said . " I know how it 's going to end . I have to fix the computer myself . " " Harry ? " There was a click , and then the buzz of a disconnection . Ross hung up . Anders immediately dialed the phone company and asked whether they had been able to trace the call . So that was why he had been looking at his watch , she thought . " Hell , " Anders said , and slammed the phone down . " They could n't get a trace . They could n't even find the incoming call . Idiots . " He sat down across the room from Ross . " He was just like a child , " she said , shaking her head . " What did he mean about fixing the computer ? " " I suppose he meant tearing out the wires from his shoulder . " " But he said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't , " she said . " He 's confused now , under the influence of all the stimulations and all the seizures . " " Is it physically possible to pull out the wires , and the computer ? " 220 THE TERMINAL MAN  | " Yes , " she said . " At least , animals do it . Monkeys ... " She rubbed her eyes . " Is there any coffee ? " Gerhard poured her a cup . " Poor Harry , " she said . " He must be terrified out there . " Across the room , Anders said , " How confused do you suppose he is , really ? " " Very . " She sipped the coffee . " Is there any sugar left ? " " Confused enough to mix up computers ? " " We 're out of sugar , " Gerhard said . " Ran out a couple of hours ago . " " I do n't understand , " she said . " He had wiring plans for the hospital , " Anders said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation , is in the hospital basement . " She set down her coffee cup and stared at him . She frowned , rubbed her eyes again , picked the coffee up , then set it down once more . " I do n't know , " she said finally . " The pathologists called while you were asleep , " Anders said . " They determined that Benson stabbed the dancer with a screwdriver . He attacked the mechanic , and he attacked Morris . Machines and people connected with machines . Morris was connected with his own mechanization . " She smiled slightly . " I 'm the psychiatrist around here . " " I 'm just asking . Is it possible ? " " Sure , of course it 's possible ... " The telephone rang again . Ross answered it . " NPS . " " Pacific Telephone liaison here , " a male voice said . " We 've rechecked that trace for Captain Anders . Is he there ? " " Just a minute . " She nodded to Anders , who picked up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long pause . Then he said , " Would you repeat that ? " He nodded as he listened .  | " And what was the time period you checked ? I see . Thank you . " He hung up , and immediately began dialing again . " You better tell me about that atomic power pack , " he said as he dialed . " What about it ? " " I want to know what happens if it 's ruptured , " Anders said , then turned away as his call was put through . " Bomb squad . This is Anders , homicide . " He turned back to Ross . Ross said , " He 's carrying around thirty-seven grams of radioactive plutonium , Pu239 . If it breaks open , you 'll expose everyone in the area to serious radiation . " " What particles are emitted ? " She looked at him in surprise . " I 've been to college , " he said , " and I can even read and write , when I have to . " " Alpha particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Anders , homicide , " he said . " I want a van at University Hospital right away . We 've got a possible radiation hazard pending . Man and immediate environment may be contaminated with an alpha emitter , Pu239 . " He listened , then looked at Ross . " Any possibility of explosion ? " " No , " she said . " No explosive , " Anders said . He listened . " All right . I understand . Get them here as quickly as you can . " He hung up . Ross said , " Do you mind telling me what 's going on ? " " The phone company rechecked that trace , " Anders said . " They 've determined that there were no calls into the hospital from the outside at the time Benson called . None at all . " Ross blinked .
