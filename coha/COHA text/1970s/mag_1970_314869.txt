Telex machines in newsrooms the world over last week tapped out a sensational story . Under a Vienna dateline , Reuters reported that a power struggle had broken out within the Kremlin . Citing sources in Belgrade and Prague , the article said that three Politburo members-Ideologue Mikhail Suslov , Trade Union Leader Alexander Shelepin and First Deputy Premier Kirill Mazurov - had taken the extreme step of writing a letter that blamed Party Boss Leonid Brezhnev and Premier Aleksei Kosygin for failures in the Soviet economy . <P> After two days of silence , the Soviet government denied that such a letter existed . Government spokesmen refused to honor the coup rumors with a denial . Neither in Moscow nor abroad was there the slightest evidence of a power struggle-or even of a letter . On the contrary , the Soviet capital was stolidly quiet . There were no signs of unusual military activity except for huge Soviet army maneuvers in Byelorussia - and Brezhnev was on the scene reviewing the exercise with Defense Minister Andrei Grechko . <P> Secret Speech . Despite the lack of supporting evidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kremlinologists was the serious economic plight of the Soviet Union . Once before , a similar situation presaged a change of leadership ; that was in 1964 , when Nikita Khrushchev was ousted mainly because of economic troubles . Ever since Brezhnev 's secret speech to the Central Committee in mid-December , which stressed grave economic problems , there has been speculation that a change might take place in the top leadership some time this year . <P> During the past three months , the substance of Brezhnev 's speech has been published in Pravda and discussed at closed party meetings throughout the Soviet Union . By all accounts , it was a scathing attack on shortcomings , waste , inefficiency and mismanagement in the economy ( TIME , Jan. 26 ) . Brezhnev spoke of lost productivity because of rampant alcoholism . As one example of mismanagement , he reportedly told of a shipment of four expensive construction cranes from East Germany . All four were shipped clear across the country to Vladivostok , but two of them actually were supposed to go to Odessa . They finally arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much for Brezhnev to deplore . Due to a combination of mismanagement , bad planning and severe winter storms , industry and agriculture are undergoing sharp slumps . Though the Kremlin claims that industrial production last year increased by 7% , U.S. sources say the actual figure may be as low as 3.5% ; in any event , the 1970 planned increase , 6.3% , is the lowest goal for any peacetime year since the first Five Year Plan was introduced in 1928 . Agricultural production actually fell 3% last year , and 1969 grain production dropped 10% . Anticipating severe shortages , the Soviets were forced to buy $150 million in wheat from Canada . Such vital industries as ferrous metals , petrochemicals , paper , cement and autos fell far short of their goals .
