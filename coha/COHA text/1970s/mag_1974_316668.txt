Due for a month-long election recess , Congress last week rushed to clear the decks-and in a few instances , did so by heaving worthwhile measures overboard . As expected , it approved a monumental reform in the financing of Presidential campaigns , providing up to $20 million in public funds for major candidates . <P> The zest for reform did not last very long . By a vote of 203 to 165 , the House rejected a far-reaching committee-realignment bill proposed by Missouri Democrat Richard Boiling ( TIME , Oct . <P> 14 ) . His program would have broken up the overloaded Ways and Means Committee , split the Education and Labor Committee in two and created a new committee on energy and environment . <P> Boiling vowed to try again for real reform next year . Meanwhile , the House approved a comparatively toothless reorganization bill that leaves the committee structure pretty much intact . <P> Among other things , the bill calls for Ways and Means to set up four subcommittees , only slightly diluting the authority of Chairman Wilbur Mills-whose political situation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Harsh Rebuke . Ignoring pressure from President Ford , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee failed to confirm Peter Flanigan , onetime troubleshooter for ex-President Nixon , as Ambassador to Spain . The inaction probably kills the nomination . Flanigan had been involved in selecting Nixon 's ambassadors , including Ruth Farkas , who became envoy to Luxembourg after donating $300,000 to Nixon 's campaign . <P> Flanigan had also played a role in ITT 's favorable 1971 antitrust settlement by getting a former White House intern to produce an analysis that supported the corporation 's position . <P> In an even harsher rebuke to Ford 's leadership , the House voted to cut off further military aid to Turkey . There were mixed reasons for the move : the use of U.S. arms in Turkish attacks on Cyprus ; irritation with the Turks over the resumption of poppy planting ; pressure from a vocal number of Greek-Americans ; and congressional unwillingness to blindly follow Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 's recommendations . The Senate had taken the same action , then , under heavy White House arm-twisting , agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termed any curtailment " a misguided and extremely harmful measure , " since it would hinder U.S. efforts to resolve the Cyprus dispute . The House vote to apply the cutoff was 187 to 171 . Ford indicated that he would promptly veto the measure . Congressional leaders then postponed the recess until this week , when an attempt will be made to override the veto .
