A30 Letters Crime in a Society Governed by Laws To the Editor : David Brown 's suggestion ( letter Dec. 7 ) that " it is time we started erring on the side of repression " in dealing with the problem of crime is a classic example of a cure far worse than the very real disease which it addresses . While Mr. Brown may believe that " a few miscarriages of justice " are " a small price " to pay for lowering the crime rate , there are excellent reasons why the criminal justice system in this country has been founded on the opposite assumption : that it is far better for guilty people to go free than for innocent ones to be convicted . This fundamental premise reflects a truth which was as clear in 1789 as it is today : that the brutality and violence of individual crimes and criminals , destructive as they are , pale into insignificance beside the degradation of the human spirit and social fabric which occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state 's criminal justice apparatus . Innumerable foreign examples show how easy it is for a government to declare that the extraordinary number or nature of crimes in its particular To the Editor : It is gratifying that President Carter has ordered Federal agencies to make most of the safety changes recommended by the Three Mile Island Commission . That certainly is a step forward . But the President 's decision to press on with the building and licensing of new nuclear power plants indicates that , in the long run , it will be " business as usual . " It was to forestall this action that some of us on the T.M.I. Commission wanted an affirmative commission vote on a moratorium . Such a vote would have given a clear signal to the President , Congress and the public that in so dangerous an enterprise as nuclear power " business as usual " will not do . I can only hope that the press and the public will not now be lulled into thinking everything is fixed , and we can therefore return to our pre-T.M.I. state of somnambulism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Editor : While the Iranian crisis does underscore the weaknesses of the present U.N . system ( " What the U.N . Will Expose , " editorial Nov. 28 ) , it is ironic that the U.S. Government has in the past opposed some of the very reforms which would have put the U.N . in a stronger position today to deal with the current explosive situation . If the U.N . had a mediation service ( proposed by the Philippines but opposed by the U.S. ) similar to the Federal Mediation Service , U.N . mediators would have been in Teheran four weeks ago negotiating for the release of the hostages . If the U.N . had a permanent corps of peace observers , U.N . observers would have been in Teheran insuring the safety and well-being of the hostages . If the U.S. had backed a stronger person for Secretary General , the Secretary General himself might have gone to Qum to talk to the Ayatollah . If the U.N . had a high commissioner for human rights ( supported by the U.S. ) or an international criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the alleged acts of the Shah in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights would have been investigated long ago , and this , in turn , might have defused the frustration of country justifies the imposition of draconian solutions , and how inevitably the resulting campaign of institutionalized violence breeds terror , counterterror and the destruction of the very values which were sought to be saved . I doubt that in fact " today the average policeman needs a lawyer to protect him when he makes an arrest , " but I am sure that the founders of this country knew what they were doing when , in order to insure that the police would be servants of the citizens and not the other way around , they created a government of laws and not of men . ERIC M. FREEDMAN New York , Dec. 8 , 1979 ? To the Editor : After reading David Brown 's letter in your paper I am ready to move to Japan or Antigua . It is only after you have been the victim of a violent crime that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you are handcuffed , bound and gagged , when you are thrown on the floor of your own house , when you feel a gun at your temples and when you try , the same people are still running the N.R.C. ( the removal of Chairman Joseph Hendrie is cosmetic , to say the least ) , and the same potential timebomb is ticking away in nuclear reactors all over the country . CAROLYN LEWIS New York , Dec. 8 , 1979 the Iranian students . If the International Court of Justice 's jurisdiction had not been restricted by the U.S.-Connally reservation , Iran might have brought its dispute over the Shah 's holdings in the U.S. to that court . The lesson should be clear . We must reform and restructure the U.N . system so that it can meet world crises . President Carter , to his credit , has proposed some constructive reforms in the area of United Nations peacekeeping , the International Court of Justice and human rights , but he has not given U.N . reform the " front burner " priority it deserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous consequences , the United States must now work to improvise the institutional strength within the U.N . system to overcome the current crisis , for the U.N . system , with all its weaknesses , is the last and perhaps only hope we have of maintaining world peace . You said that the U.S. would survive the Iranian rebuff , but the pretensions of the U.N . may not . I would rephrase that to read : The U.N . can survive with its present weaknesses , but the world may not . WALTER HOFFMANN National Chairman Campaign for U.N . Reform Wayne , N.J. , Nov. 28 , 1979 are then relieved of all your valuable possessions ? that 's when you begin to re-evaluate any liberal tendencies you might have . Certainly it 's time for a change . ( I fear to have my name used in your paper  --  they may come back . ) NAME WITHHELD Whitestone , N.Y. , Dec. 7 , 1979 ? To the Editor : Who is David Brown , and where has he been all this time ? There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never gone away . Many Hispanics and blacks can testify to that . It seems that for many Americans " police brutality " was a concept in vogue in the 1960 's , when white antiwar demonstrators were being beaten up by cops during demonstrations . Many assume that " police brutality " went the way of the flower children . The fact is that there would not be enough space on this page to just list the cases of police brutality ? including murder ? perpetrated against Hispanics in the last few years . In Texas , California , Florida and right here at home in the Big Apple they are common occurrences . To add insult to injury , most of the culprits go unpunished . Hispanics are as eager to see our streets safe as any other Americans . But unlike Mr. Brown , we do not think that " a few miscarriages of justice is a small price to pay . " Any miscarriage of justice is indeed a high price to pay for all concerned .

Would n't he , too , prefer a life of indolence at state expense to one of equal penury accompanied by hard work ? Is it really a " funny thing " that the ambulantes hope to achieve , through a Marxist victory at the ballot box , the redistribution of wealth that has eluded them in the market economy ? Confusion , social contrast and resentment are forces everywhere , not only in the markets of Mr. Zileri Gibson 's third world . The issue to which Professor Hayek has addressed himself is whether a free market is better able than a managed economy to channel people 's productive energies for the common good . The story of Peru 's spontaneous " young towns , " bustling and productive , forms a telling contrast with the fate of Phnom Penh . NEIL M. SINGER Washington , Dec. 6 , 1979 Caution on Yemen To the Editor : If , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yemen has become the Sihanouk of the Mideast , it is proper that President Carter remain sensitive to the outcome of our actions in Southeast Asia . Mr. Satire 's course will embroil the world in another needless war and perhaps result in another Cambodia . HOWARD SHAPIRO Williamstown , Mass. , Dec. 3 , 1979 NOW Logic To the Editor : The decision by NOW ( National Organization of Women ) not to support Carter regardless of who is running against him is the kind of logic that men for centuries have accused women of having . A. SOCK New York , Dec. 11 , 1979 Perilous Nuclear ' Business as Usual ' The U.N . ' s Iranian Lesson When the Time Comes to Give Teheran a Deadline To the Editor : The Times is , of course , within its rights in opposing , as you did on Dec. 2 , the resolution which 53 of my colleagues and I introduced in the House last week proposing that if all peaceful alternatives to bring about the release of the hostages in Iran fail , the President should consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose , a deadline for their release , with the understanding that if they were not released by then the United States would begin military actions against Iran . The tenor of your editorial reflects a misunderstanding of exactly what we proposed . That is not surprising , since the press accounts failed to include the detailed explanation we released at the time our resolution was introduced . First , we are not suggesting that the President set a deadline now . We fully support the " peaceful and diplomatic " avenues he is presently following and hope he will be successful . We believe they should be pursued completely and with great patience . We hope they will bear fruit . But what if they do n't ? Two of them seem to be fading already : The new Iranian Foreign Minister makes it clear that Iran will not pay any attention to a Security Council resolution , and the notion that the Shah 's departure for Mexico might help has likewise gone up in smoke . Does anyone seriously expect Iran to pay any greater respect to a World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings results , what then ? Do we let the hostages stay indefinitely , with military pressures to be applied only if they are harmed or killed ? They have been harmed already , scarred for life , at least psychologically . The Iranians could hold them like this for months , even years . Do we still make no overt response ? The longer the seizure goes on without any response , the greater also is the danger to other Americans serving abroad . Already mobs have sacked and killed in Pakistan , and our embassies have been hit with demonstrations , fires and explosions in Bangkok , Kuwait , Manila , Bangladesh and Libya . If America appears unable or unwilling to force the return of its own citizens in Iran , every kookie terrorist group will find other overseas Americans an inviting target . The Iranians say that if we try military action they will kill the hostages . But they also say we are bluffing about mounting any military response . Maybe they are bluffing . Military action involves risks , of course . But leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any moment . There are hints that some may already have been injured . In short , time is not necessarily on our side . The blunt announcement that unless the hostages are returned by a certain date , we will initiate military action could actually speed up their release . Suddenly the Iranians would realize we do mean business . Suddenly their Moslem neighbors might realize they would n't want protracted American military operations going on in their backyard , and would finally put some real pressures on Iran to cut out the nonsense and let the hostages go . No one knows for sure what the outcome will be . But as this tragedy drags on , it should be clear that there is no simple , easy , painless solution . The American people and their Government face very tough decisions . In the circumstances it is hardly " reckless " to begin at least a survey of the courses of action still left to us ? reasonably , realistically , and without invective . SAMUEL S.
