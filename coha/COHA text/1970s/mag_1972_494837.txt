Absentee Owners of America ? II Poor Rich West Virginia by Paul J. Kaufman In bygone days , when General Motors ' good was said to be the nation 's and " ecology " was only a word on science tests , West Virginia was called " the Switzer ? land of America . " A sign bearing this sobriquet was hanging on the Silver Bridge at Point Pleasant five years ago when it collapsed into the Ohio River , kill ? ing 47 people . Since then , West Virginia has witnessed the Farmington mine disaster of 1968 , in which 74 miners died , and the Buffalo Creek flood of this past February that claimed 125 . Recurrent disasters are one of the differences between West Virginia and Switzer ? land . Another is that West Virginia is notorious not for the money it gets but for the money that corporations take out of it . In 1972 , for the first time in the state 's history , a candidate for governor posed a challenge to the coal industry . John D. Rockefeller IV argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginians and should be abolished . He pledged long overdue enforcement of coal mine health and safety laws . He promised to curb the manifold environmen ? tal abuses long perpetrated by king coal . These were not his prime issues ; throughout most of the cam ? paign , he concentrated on the need for jobs and roads . But the coal interests were not to be denied ? not even by a Rockefeller . It is ironic that Rockefeller ( no anti ? capitalist he ) was tagged as an " outsider " who was using the state for personal reasons whereas , in truth , his principal opposition ( and his adversary 's chief support ) came from corporations which for the most part are owned and directed by out of state interests that have for so long exploited the state and its people . In the past , coal has enjoyed the favor of both candi PAUL J. KAUFMAN is director of the Appalachian Research and Defense Fund in Charleston , W.Va. dates for governor of West Virginia . In return , both parties usually receive large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic can ? didate asserted in effect that he was prepared to deal at arm 's length with the industry , that he could finance his own campaign and that king coal , under his ad ? ministration , would be expected to obey the law like anyone else , without favor or preferential treatment . Rockefeller was roundly defeated . The state has 55 counties , about 1.8 million people . The nine southernmost counties account for approxi ? mately 30 percent of the population and produce about 70 percent of the coal . Nine corporations own more than one-third of the land in these counties , and the top 25 landowners control more than half . Of the nine dominant corporations , only one is a West Virginia company doing business principally within the state . The others are Pocahontas Land Corporation , a wholly owned subsidiary of the Norfolk and Western Rail ? road ; Georgia-Pacific , a timber company headquar ? tered in Oregon ; Western Pocahontas Corporation , a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad ; Island Creek Coal Company , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diversified company holding huge tracts of land ; Union Carbide , one of the world 's largest chemical companies ; Beaver Coal Corporation ; and Bethlehem Steel . Let 's take a closer look at the ownership of one of the nine counties ? McDowell ? which is the largest coal-producing county in the nation . Two-thirds of the miners are employed by out-of-state corporations , seven of which own 76 percent of the land . Six of these corporations ? US Steel , Eastern Gas and Fuel Asso ? ciates , Hawley Coal , Olga Coal , Consolidation Coal ( a Continental Oil subsidiary ) , and the Semet-Solvay DECEMBER 2 , 1972 division of Allied Chemical ? produce two-thirds of McDowell 's coal . Since half of all local property taxes are used to sup ? port the school system , one might expect the county board of education to fight for higher property taxes . Three of the five McDowell County Board of Education members have close connections with the coal indus ? try . The president of the board is a former US Steel physician . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the county , and a third is connected with Superior-Cannellton Coal . They do not seek higher property taxes . The leader of the dominant Democratic faction in McDowell County is a former United States attorney and is president of the McDowell County Court . His law firm represents the Norfolk and Western Railroad , Pocahontas Fuel ( a division of Consolidation Coal , i.e. , Continental Oil ) , Island Creek Coal , Phillips Coal , Slab Fork Coal , and Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates . Another member of the law firm is an assistant county prosecuting attorney . A member of the state legislature from McDowell County , who is also a former speaker of the house of delegates , is a prominent coal operator who once obtained a concession from the state department of natural resources to mine coal in a state-owned pre ? serve ? a concession which was revoked only after pro ? longed legal action . How have the people of McDowell County fared amidst their abundant mineral wealth ? Between 1950 and 1970 , McDowell lost nearly half its population . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under $3000 . More than half the adults in the county have never been to high school . What 's true of McDowell County is characteristic of most of Appa ? lachia . Despite the fact that coal , oil and gas com ? panies have prospered almost beyond measure , the land and its inhabitants have not . Appalachia is not poor ? it is a wealthy region inhabited by poor people . It 's not only money that Appalachians lose to giant corporations ; the same absentee enterprises are de ? stroying what 's left of the region 's beauty and bounty . Streams are badly polluted from coal wastes and acid mine drainage . The air is filthy from burning gob piles and slag heaps . Factories and power plants dump their industrial garbage with little restraint ; the region 's once lovely mountains are being stripped , gouged and ravaged . Like the military officer who found it neces ? sary to destroy a Vietnam village in order to save it , the absentee energy corporations seem intent on devouring Appalachia in order to make it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger the company , the bigger and more destruc ? tive equipment they can and do afford . American Elec ? tric Power Company , the nation 's largest utility , is also the 20th largest coal producer . Along with the Tennessee Valley Authority , it has set the pace for pro ? 13 duction and consumption of cheap , strip-mined coal in Appalachia . The people of Appalachia want an end to stripping . Kanawha County is the most populous in West Vir ? ginia and is extensively strip-mined , yet a newspaper poll of Kanawha voters earlier this year found that 68 percent favored an end to stripping . In 1967 , West Vir ? ginia enacted strong controls over strip-mining . They have not been enforced . In 1970 , a candidate for the state senate pledged , if elected , to support abolition of strip-mining . The issue was joined by his opponent who saw nothing wrong with " responsible " stripping . The abolitionist candidate won by a comfortable mar ? gin . In 1972 , the Democratic gubernatorial nominee , a congressman , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tantamount to election on the basis of their stands against stripping . Nevertheless , the coal industry , through its friends in Congress , the more entrenched members of the state legislature and the Executive Branch of government , continues to do pretty much as it pleases in the interest of " economic growth . " The social and economic costs to the people of Appa ? lachia are immense . The Appalachian Regional Com ? mission estimates it would cost $6.6 billion to clean up the streams polluted by acid mine drainage alone . Tax.es paid by manufacturing corporations to meet these costs are totally inadequate and but a trifle com ? pared to their profits . In West Virginia until recently , corporate taxes were little more than those paid by cigarette smokers , and less was collected from the entire coal industry than from the sale of liquor . The " private government " of the giant corporations is be ? yond the reach of the West Virginia citizenry and of the state itself . The annual revenues of West Virginia are approximately $600 million . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own vast chunks of the state are far greater . Operating revenues for American Electric Power came to $779 million last year . New sales of Union Carbide for the first quarter of 1972 amounted to $760 million . The West Virginia Public Service Commission , which is charged with controlling all public utilities and common carriers operating in the state , is required by law to be supported financially by the very corpora ? tions it is supposed to regulate . Its funding is minimal . Most of the state regulatory agencies are required by law to include corporate representatives on their governing , appeal or advisory boards . The overlap between state government and big bus ? iness is pervasive , as shown in the accompanying chart on page 14 . Such togetherness does little for the victims of cor ? porate neglect . The Buffalo Creek flood , for example , was a consequence of massive quantities of waste water being stored behind piles of unstable coal slag and sludge by the Buffalo Mining Company , a sub ? sidiary of Pittston , the largest independent coal pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local industry lobbyists , the legislature responded to the flood by prescribing periodic inspections of coal waste piles and their eradication only if , in a given case , they were found to pose an " imminent " hazard to life and limb . The governor of West Virginia " ordered " that water and run-off , which had accumulated behind other gob piles , be emptied into West Virginia 's rivers and creeks . No effort was made to seek more construc ? tive means of disposing of these wastes or altering the processing methods which create them , since that might inconvenience the coal companies . Similarly , coal companies violate both state and fed ? eral safety laws with virtual impunity . Pittston leads all companies in violation of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act with 5000 citations and $1 mil ? lion in assessed penalties , none of which have been paid . Since 1970 , the top 20 coal . companies in West Virginia have failed to pay $76,180 in penalties as ? sessed against them by the state . Consolidation Coal , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blacksville No. 1 mine , where nine men died in an underground fire last July , had been cited for safety violations 485 times by the federal government and 465 times by the state . The mine 's general foreman , Herman Liddle , admitted at a public hearing that , in his opinion , the disaster would not have occurred if safety regulations had been followed . Solving the problems of Appalachia , especially the basic problem of absentee ownership , will not be easy , but here are some suggestions : Bo . Require federal incorporation of all interstate com ? panies with provision for true public representation on their governing boards . IN- Impose a federal severance tax on all extractive in ? dustries , coupled with a supplemental tax on mineral reserves , allowing tax credits to companies that pay similar taxes to states . 4 Amend the federal mine safety law to allow citizen suits for triple damages and injunctive relief . 110- Require approval by the Environmental Protec ? tion Agency of new industrial undertakings . Ap ? proval or disapproval would be based upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . lo ? Require that existing gob piles and coal waste banks be leveled or stored in abandoned mines and that hereafter all coal wastes , slag , sludge , etc. , be stowed underground . 4 Permit strip-mining only if and when total res ? toration of the land can be carried out promptly and effectively . The Department of the Interior should undertake a massive program to purchase and rehabil ? itate lands already stripped . Lands acquired by the government should be resold to dispossessed rural residents or local cooperatives at low cost and on liberal credit terms . 4 Purge all public regulatory agencies of industry DECEMBER 2 , 1972 representatives . 4 Make corporate officials personally and criminally liable for violation of any law enacted for the protec ? tion of the public . 4 Enable the Appalachian Regional Commission to fund cooperative or publicly owned power companies to compete with the " investor-owned " utilities that dominate much of Appalachia. 15 4 Establish an Appalachian Mountain Authority , similar to TVA but owned by the residents of Appa ? lachia rather than the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and to purchase , by condemnation if necessary , energy sources , land and mineral rights . Alternatively or additionally , there should be established public utility districts similar to those in Oregon and Washington . Conscientious Objectors In the Air Force by Peter J. Ognibene In June 1971 , an air force acquaintance told me that several officers had declared themselves COs and that most of them were Air Force Academy graduates . The following month I went to the academy and spoke with the superintendent , Lt. Gen. Albert P. Clark . He had " heard rumors of four or five .. . insignificant compared to the 4000 graduates who are serving their country . " In the course of my visit I learned the names of four of the recent graduates who had applied for CO status and arranged to meet them . Lieutenants George Joyal and Richard Pavel ( class of 1969 ) were stationed in Omaha at Offut Air Force Base , the home of the Strategic Air Command ; Lieutenants John Thompson and Robert Webb ( class of 1970 ) were based at Lowry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academy graduates who had become COs and esti ? mated the total might run as high as 20 . ( I now know the names of 10 . ) The secretary of the air force can release with honor ? able discharges those servicemen he finds sincere in their renunciation of all wars , and air force regulation 35-24 establishes the official procedure for processing CO requests submitted by officers and enlisted men . Nonetheless , when each of these four officers made his request , each was harassed . The key element in the harassment was a promissory note , obliging the signer to pay the government for the portion of his service obligation which would go unfilled as a result of his PETER J. OGNIBENE , a contributing editor of this journal , graduated from the Air Force Academy in 1963 and taught political science there from 1968 until his resignation from the air force in 1970. discharge as a CO . Joyal and Pavel were presented with notes which would have required them to pay the government $30,000 at six percent annual interest in monthly installments of not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The legal pretext for this promissory note stems from the failure of the academy graduate discharged as a CO to fulfill the five-year service obligation in his cadet contract . There is , however , an escape clause in that contract , written no doubt so the air force can get rid of an officer who does not want to leave the service . It says : " As a commissioned officer I will be required to serve until duly released by competent authority . " Under the regulation concerning COs , the secretary of the air force is clearly the " competent authority . " Offi ? cers can be given " early outs " for any number of rea ? sons , among them hardship , incompetence or consci ? entious objection to war . Yet , only those few officers who have become COs have been asked to sign these promissory notes . When Joyal protested in a letter to President Nixon , the White House referred the matter to the air force . In a reply dated July 9 , 1971 , from the office of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " any agree ? ment you make to voluntarily reimburse the govern ? ment is not posited as a precondition to discharge nor as a consideration in determining the merits of your application for separation as a conscientious objector . " Had the letter stopped there , no one could have called it harassment . But the next paragraph read : " The Judge Advocate General , USAF , informs me that since you received substantial educational benefits and now seek to be discharged of the concomitant obligations
