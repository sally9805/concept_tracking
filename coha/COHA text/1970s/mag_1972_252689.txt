For the past 23 years , visits to Manhattan by London 's Royal Ballet have become a springtime ritual . In most cases , the company 's programming has become ritualistic too : 19th century warhorses like Swan Lake and Giselle , plus a generous dash of contemporary works like The Dream and The Two Pigeons by the Royal 's longtime director Sir Frederick Ashton . <P> The company 's current six-week stand at Lincoln Center , however , has a special point of interest . It is its first under the directorship of Kenneth MacMillan , 42 , an Ashton disciple who is best known for his full-length Romeo and Juliet , and who succeeded his mentor in the fall of 1970 . For the occasion , the company is sporting two new MacMillan pieces . Alas , together they lay two of the biggest eggs of the New York ballet season . <P> &gt; Triad seems to be about a triangular love relationship in which a girl ( Antoinette Sibley ) breaks up an affair between two male homosexuals ( Anthony Dowell and Wayne Eagling ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are brothers . Fraternal love is admittedly difficult to convey these days , but in this short work MacMillan has compounded the problem by his cramped and largely uninteresting choreography . <P> &gt; Anastasia is an admirably ambitious but ultimately unconvincing full-length ballet about Tsar Nicholas II 's youngest daughter Lynn Seymour who , by some accounts , escaped execution at the hands of the Bolsheviks and as Anna Anderson spent years unsuccessfully trying to prove that she was indeed the Grand Duchess Anastasia . The first two acts , using music by Tchaikovsky , pro vide a touching but repetitive romantic-ballet picture of Anastasia 's life prior to the October revolution . The final act is a jarring change to a heavily psycho logical modern-dance style ( set to a dreary electronic introduction and Martinu 's sweet and sour Fantaisies Symphoniques ) . A distraught Anna , apparently living in a mental ward , relives the past as she imagines or remembers it . As to whether Anna was an impostor , no one knows for sure , including , unfortunately , MacMillan . <P> The disappointment of these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev in Romeo and Juliet . But generally the work of the company betrays a certain unease . It may be that MacMillan and his dancers have not yet struck the right working relationship . If so , MacMillan did not improve matters by staying in London , leaving esprit , not to mention foot work , to others .
