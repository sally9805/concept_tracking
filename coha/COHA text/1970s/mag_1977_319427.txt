The branching and flowering of Southern family trees are the special province of Novelist Reynolds Price ( A Long and Happy Life , The Surface of Earth ) . Assigned by TIME , Price went to Plains from his home in Durham , N.C. , and met many of the Carters . He writes : <P> Despite the waves of tourists and newsmen who are washing over Plains ( pop . 683 ) and providing brisk business for the Peanut Museum , the sandwich shop , and the new stores selling what Miss Lillian calls " Jimmy-things , " the main pastime still seems to be memory-as it is in all villages , Southern or otherwise , where people lead lives of work and family . Stop most anyone you see-they 're generally stoppable-and he or she will soon be spinning you a web of recollection to entertain you both . They tend to start with Carters , since that 's why you 're here ; but soon they 'll show you a crowd of human reasons for stopping at this wide spot in the road and listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was not their pride . He clearly is and they all call him Jimmy , to your face and his-no reverence yet-as they sketch in his family backward from him . For if you are quiet and let them tell what they need to tell , not what you think you want , then the story is family , unendingly . <P> There is one memory left to start the story forward and work down to Jimmy , who seems a tad still in that ongoing stream . Mr. Alton Carter , age 88 , is Jimmy 's dead father 's elder brother . A short , gentle-voiced man , he haunts his son Hugh 's antiques store on Main Street , meeting all with old-fashioned manners and a memory that runs back , clear and voluminous , to the early ' 90s , well before his mother Nina moved here to Plains with him , his three sisters and his brother James Earl . For with all his tendrils of memory and hearsay that reach from the main stem back toward the Revolution , England and Ireland , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start-with calamity his own eyes saw up close . <P> His father William , Jimmy 's grandfather , was killed in 1903 , 50 miles south of Plains in a fight with a man named Taliaferro ( pronounced Tolliver ) : " My daddy went over to his place to argue with him about a little desk that he took off . They fought in his store with bottles . They had barrels of beer bottles . They stood there busting bottles over one another 's head . My daddy got out and started home , going this-a-way ; and Taliaferro got out and started his way , his home was out thataway . And Taliaferro run off out there about 30 yards and stopped and started shooting . He shot three times but he did n't hit him but once , in the back of the head . He never did have time to get out his pistol . I was as close to him as that truck 15 ft. away . " <P> After four trials , Taliaferro was freed ; and Nina Carter brought her children to Plains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 15 , went to work in the store where he still works daily ( then a general store ) , helped support his family on $25 a month , acquired the store in time , and saw Jimmy 's father grow and pass him in success : " Everything Earl laid his hand down on , when he picked it up , there was three or four dollars . When he died he left about 4,000 acres of land and a heap of money in the bank . "
