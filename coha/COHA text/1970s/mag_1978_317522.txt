Barely six hours earlier , the arena in Hartford , Conn. , had echoed with the cheers of 5,000 fans watching an evening college basketball game . Now it lay in ruins . Said Restaurateur Frank Parseliti , owner of one of the 50-odd small businesses situated in the-$70 million civic center complex that was built only three years ago : " It looks like a big meteorite crashed in the middle of the coliseum . " With a terrifying roar , the 2-acre , 1,400-ton steel-latticed roof of the deserted arena had collapsed under the weight of 4.8 in. of wet snow . <P> As New England storms go , that is by no means an excessive amount ; in fact , a blizzard that roared across the Northeast later in the week , paralyzing much of the Atlantic seaboard , dumped up to 16 in. on Hartford 's rooftops . What is more , the flat , " space frame " roof , which was supported at its corners by four concrete pylons , was , supposedly designed to be strong enough to withstand far greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I do n't think it was a natural disaster . I think there was something wrong with how it was constructed . " <P> Athanson and his fellow Hartfordites were thankful that no one was hurt in the accident . But they were shaken , since the civic center was the symbol of the city 's downtown renewal , and the 12,500-seat coliseum was the cynosure of the complex . Home of the World Hockey Association 's New England Whalers , the arena was also the site of other sporting events , concerts and conventions . As a result of the roofs collapse , more than 300 scheduled events will have to be canceled ; in the 1 to two years that may be needed to rebuild the structure , the local chamber of commerce estimates that business losses could approach $20 million . As Hartford began an investigation into the collapse , City Manager James Daken pledged : " We 'll build a new structure , a new coliseum . It will be bigger and better-and it will have a different kind of roof . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
