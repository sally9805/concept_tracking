DEALING or THE BERKELEY-TO-BOSTON FORTY-BRICK LOST-BAG BLUES by " Michael Douglas . " 222 pages . Knopf. $5.95 . <P> <P> This is a deft little novel-and more . It is a shaggy-dog story about marijuana that will amuse potheads , yet remain palatable to middle-class matrons who wonder why Junior is both amorphous and resentful . In short , a very slick piece of work . <P> With Michael Crichton as one-half of the author , it should be . Though only 28 , Crichton has already found time to graduate from medical school and write two popular books-The Andromeda Strain ( scifi ) and Five Patients ( medical reportage ) . Unlike most other young describers of the world of grass , he knows the value of clarity and coherence . As a full-fledged ( though nonpracticing ) doctor , he certainly does not inflate pot ; he seems to see it simply as a pleasurable , nonaddictive drug somewhat less harmful than alcohol . Moreover , Michael has a kid brother Douglas , a student with a fine ear for the funky idiom of youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystique . Combining their talents under the pseudonym " Michael Douglas , " the Crichton boys manufactured Dealing in a matter of months . <P> Means of Escape . Their narrator-hero , Peter Harkness , is a product of the affluent suburbs , a student at Harvard and a " good head . " The story starts with his flying trip to Berkeley to pick up ten bricks of righteous grass . From there , the plot hurtles forward with pace , plausibility and a cast that would do credit to an Ian Fleming thriller . Meet Musty the connection , who regularly runs 2,000 kilos of pot-no more , no less-from Mexico to California ; John Thayer Hartnup III , Harvard 's richest student and biggest dealer ; Sukie , of the long legs and golden tan , whose love scenes with Peter seem cribbed from quondam TV cigarette commercials . Eventually , Sukie is seized with 40 bricks of marijuana in Boston . It all ends as some sort of upside-down revisionist Gangbusters , with the grass-blowing " criminals " in smug pursuit of a narcotics officer . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps the plot from lapsing into farce . Melancholy , not revolutionary fervor , afflicts him . Tolerantly , he still laughs at his father 's dull jokes and politely listens to his college adviser . Nevertheless , he speaks for ambivalent , marijuana-struck youth when he wryly observes the machinelike aspects of civilization and objects to the meaninglessness of a life in which people become what they are " least afraid of becoming . " Given such a context , Peter calculates that pot , with all its drawbacks , provides a means of honest and pleasurable rebellion and escape . <P> The problem that dominates the book is not escape and enjoyment but mechanical procurement . Even though most people frown on dealing in marijuana - after all , it is against the law-the authors describe passing the stuff as just an exhilarating sport . By treating grass with such lightheartedness , the Crichton boys send a controversial message directly to a wide audience . Dealing , etc. , is not really about a flip caper ; it is a subliminal plea to legalize pot .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
