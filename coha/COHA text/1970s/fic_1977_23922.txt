by Philip Roth avid Kepesh is an intelligent and spirited young academic with a proclivity for " erotic daredeviltry . " In his college days he fervently proclaims himself to be , like Byron , " studious by day , dissolute by night , " but he does not realize his fantasies until he arrives in London on a scholarship and moves into a basement flat with two Swedish girls , Birgitta and Elisabeth . The subsequent sexual turmoil drives one of the girls to attempt suicide . Alarmed by his own excesses , and exhausted by the conflict he feels between his lustful inclinations and the need for self-control , David returns to America , bent on redemption . Now in his mid-twenties , he is ready to marry and remake his disordered life . Philip Roth is the author of Goodbye , Columbus , Portnoy 's Complaint , The Breast , and My Life as a Man . This section is part of his novel , The Professor of Desire , to be published by Farrar , Straus &; Giroux in October .

Chiengmai , Rangoon , Singapore , Mandalay ... why not Jupiter , why not Mars ? To be sure , I know these places exist beyond the Rand McNally map on which I trace the course of her adventures ( as once I traced down an adventure of l3irgitta 's in the London phone directory ) , and the novels of Conrad where I first encountered them and so , of course , do I know that " characters " live and breathe who choose to make their destiny in the stranger cities of the world .... What then fails to persuade me completely that living , breathing Helen is one of them ? My being with her ? Is the unbelievable character Helen in her diamond stud earrings or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seersucker suit ? I even become somewhat suspicious and critical of her serene , womanly beauty , or , rather , of the regard in which she seems to hold her eyes , her nose , her throat , her breasts , her hips , her legs  --  why , even her feet would seem to her to have charming little glories to be extolled . How does she come by this regal bearing , anyway , this aristocratic sense of herself that seems to derive almost entirely from the smoothness of skin , the length of limb , the breadth of mouth and span of eyes , and the fluting at the very tip of what she describes , without batting an eyelid ( shadowed in the subtlest green ) , as her " Flemish " nose ? I am not at all accustomed to someone who bears her beauty with such a sense of attainment and self-worth . My experience  --  running from the Syracuse undergraduates who did not want to " relate " to me " on that level , " to Birgitta SvanstrOm , for whom flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrill  --  has been of young women who make no great fuss about their looks , or believe at least that it is not seemly to show how much they do . True , Birgitta knew well enough that her hair , cut short and carelessly , nicely enhanced her charming furtiveness , but otherwise how she framed her unpainted face was not a subject to which she gave much thought from one morning to the next . And Elisabeth , with an abundance of hair no less praiseworthy than Helen 's , simply brushed it straight down her back , letting it hang there as it had since she was six . To Helen , however , all that marvelous hair  --  closest in shading to the coat of an Irish setter  --  seems to be in the nature of a crown , or a spire , or a halo , there not simply to adorn or em-hellish but to express , to symbolize . Perhaps it is only a measure of how narrow and cloistered my life has become or perhaps it is in fact the true measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself as an idolized object that might just as well have been carved of 100 pounds of jade  --  but when she twists her hair up into a soft knot at the back of her head , and draws a black line above her lashes  --  above eyes in themselves no larger and no bluer than Elisabeth 's  --  when she dons a dozen bracelets and ties a fringed silk scarf around her hips like Carmen to go out to buy some oranges for breakfast , the effect is not lost upon me . Far from it . I have always been overcome by physical beauty in women , but by Helen I am not just intrigued and aroused , I am also alarmed , and made deeply , deeply uncertain  --  utterly subjugated by the authority with which she claims and confirms and makes singular her loveliness , and as suspicious as I can be of the prerogatives , of the place , thereby bestowed upon her in her own imagination . Hers seems to me sometimes such a banalized conception of self and experience , and ye-t , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I know , maybe she is right .

" " He came here for a week , but I would n't sleep with him . I sent him back . It nearly did me in . It was hideous , sending him away . " " Well , maybe he 'll go ahead and have his wife killed anyway , as an enticement ? " " Why must you make fun of him ? Is it so impossible for you to believe that he 's as human as you ?

" " Will I blow somebody 's brains out to get it ? Will I push somebody down the elevator shaft ? What do you think ? " " Look , I 'm the one who gave up everything and nearly died of it  --  just because I could n't bear to hear the idea even spoken . It terrified me to know that he could even have such a thought . Or maybe it was so very tempting , and that 's why I went running . Because all I had to say was yes ; that 's all he was waiting for . He was desperate , David , and he was serious .

Surely such a well-known and important man has all kinds of means at his disposal to get a measly wife out of the way : limousines that crash , boats that sink , airplanes that explode in midair . Had he done it on his own , to begin with , what you thought about it all would never even have come up . If he asked your opinion . maybe it was to hear no . " " Oh , this is interesting . Go on .

Just because he 's someone with power , you think he has no feelings . But there are men , you know , who have both . We met two times a week for two years . And it never changed . It was never anything but perfect . You do n't believe such things happen , do you ? Or even if they do , you do n't want to believe they matter .

" And who , oh who is being the sentimentalist now ? It appears then that the capacity for pain-filled renunciation joined to the gift for sensual abandon is what makes her appeal inescapable .

The day she has the wool shirt that was to have been dry-cleaned laundered by mistake , I take over going to the cleaners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am occupied  --  and glad of it  --  some sixteen hours a day with teaching my classes and rewriting into a book my thesis on the theme of romantic disillusionment in Anton Chekhov ( a subject I 'd chosen before even meeting my wife ) , and Helen has taken increasingly to drink and to dope . Her days begin in jasmine-scented waters . With olive oil in her hair to make it glossy after washing , and her face anointed with vitamin creams , she reclines in the tub for twenty minutes each morning , eyes closed and the precious skull at rest against a small inflated pillow , moving only to rub gently with her pumice stone the rough skin on her feet . Three times a week the bath is followed by her facial sauna : in her midnight-blue silk kimono , embroidered with pink and red poppies and yellow birds never seen on land or sea , she sits at the counter of our tiny kitchenette , her turbaned head tilted over a bowl of steaming water sprinkled with rosemary- and camomile and elder flower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to dress for her exercise class  --  and wherever else it is she goes off to while I am at school : a close-fitting Chinese dress of navy-blue silk , high at the collar and slit to the thigh ; the diamond stud earrings ; bracelets of jade and of gold ; her jade ring ; her sandals ; her straw bag . When she returns later in the day  --  after yoga she decided to go into San Francisco " to loo around " : she talks ( has talked for years ) of plan to open a Far East antique shop there  --  she is a ready a little high , and by dinnertime she is a smiles : mellow , blotto , wry . " Life is toast , " she of serves , sipping four fingers of rum while I seaso the lamb chops . " Life is leftovers . Life is leathe soles and rubber heels . Life is carrying forward th balance into the new checkbook . Life is writing th correct amount to be paid out onto each of th stubs . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The is all true , " I say .

" Y THE TIME WE ARE into our &id]; we have so exacerbated our antipathies that each us has been reduced to precisely what the other h been so leery of at the outset , the professor " smugness " and " prissiness " for which Helen ( tests me with all her heart --  " You 've actually do it , David  --  you are a full-fledged young fogy " less in evidence than her " utter mindlessness , " " i otic wastefulness , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can never leave her , nor she me , not , that until outright disaster makes it simply ludicrous go on waiting for the miraculous , conversion of 1 other .

The months go by and we remain togetlwondering if a child would somehow resolve t crazy deadlock ... or an antique shop of her for Helen ... or a jewelry shop ... or psychothf py for us both . Again and again we hear oursel described as a strikingly " attractive " couple : Tressed , traveled , intelligent , worldly ( especially as oung academic couples go ) , a combined income of 12,000 a year ... and life is simply awful . What little spirit smolders on in me during the tst months of the marriage is visible only in class ; therwise , 1 am so affectless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has me under sedation . " Ever since the approval of my dis2:rtation I have been teaching , along with the fresh-Ian course " Introduction to Fiction , " two sections f the sophomore survey in " general " literature . ? uring the weeks near the end of the term when we udy Chekhov 's stories , I find , while reading aloud my students passages which I particularly want iem to take note of , that each and every sentence : ems to me to allude to my own plight above all , though by now every single syllable I think or tter must first trickle down through my troubles . nd then there are my classroom daydreams , as ! entiful suddenly as they are irrepressible , and so Jviously inspired by longings for miraculous salvaan  --  reentry into lives I lost long ago , reincarnaan as a being wholly unlike myself  --  that I ant ' en somewhat grateful to he depressed and with-it anything like the will power to set even the ildest fantasy in motion .

Meanwhile , another student is explaining what landowner Alyohin means at the conclusion of bout Love " when he speaks of " what is higher . than happiness or unhappiness , sin or virtue in : ir usual meaning . " The student says , " He regrets it he did n't yield to his feeling and run off with woman he fell in love with . Now that she 's going away , he 's miserable for having allowed conscience and scruples , and his own timidity , to forbid him from confessing his love to her just because she is already married and a mother . " I nod , but without real comprehension . Rather , I am thinking , " What are you doing , Miss Rodgers , dining on Peanut Chews ? We should be sipping white wine ... " And suddenly it occurs to me that , as an undergraduate at USC , Helen probably looked rather like my bored Miss Rodgers in the months before that older man  --  a man of about my age ! ? plucked her out of the classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour , I look up from reading aloud out of " Lady with a Lapdog " directly into the innocent and uncorrupted gaze of the plump , earnest , tenderhearted Jewish girl from Beverly Hills who has sat in the front row all year long writing down everything I say . I read to the class the story 's final paragraph , in which the adulterous couple , shaken to find how deeply they love one another , try vainly " to understand why he should have a wife and she a husband . " " And it seemed to diem that in only a few more minutes a solution would be found and a new , beautiful life would begin ; but both of them knew very well that the end was still a long , long way away and that the most complicated and difficult part was only just beginning . " I hear myself speaking of the moving transparency of the ending  --  no false mysteries , only the harsh facts directly stated . I speak of the amount of human history that Chekhov can incorporate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , even within so short a space , to sorrow and pathos , of his feel for the disillusioning moment and for those processes wherein actuality seemingly pounces upon even our most harmless illusions , not to mention the grand dreams of fulfillment and adventure . I speak of his pessimism about what he calls " this business of personal happiness , " and all the while I want to ask the chubby girl in the front row , who is rapidly . recording my words in her notebook , to become my daughter . I want to look after her and see that she is safe and happy . I want to pay for her clothes and her doctor bills and for her to come and put her arms around me when she is feeling lonely or sad . if only it were Helen and I who had raised her to be so sweet ! But how could we two raise anything ? And later that day , when I happen to run into her walking toward me on the campus , I feel impelled yet again to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve years my junior that I want to adopt her , want her to forget her own parents , about whom I know nothing , and let me father and protect her . " Hi , Mr. Kepesh , " she says , with a little wave of the hand , and that affectionate gesture does it , apparently . I feel as though I am growing lighter and lighter , I sense an emotion coming my way that will pick me up and turn me over and deposit me I know not where . Am I going to have my nervous collapse right here on the walk in front of the library ? I take one of her hands in mine  --  I am saying , through a throat clogged with feeling , " You 're a good girl , Kathie . " She ducks her head , her forehead colors . " Well , " she says , " I 'm glad somebody around here likes me . " " You 're a good girl , " I repeat , and release the soft hand I am holding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare dinner for two . BOUT THIS TIME we are visited by an English investment banker named Donald Garland , the first of Helen 's Hong Kong friends ever to be invited to dine with us in our apartment . To be sure , she has on occasion made herself spectacularly beautiful so as to go into San Francisco to have lunch with somebody or other out of paradise lost , but never before have I seen her approach such a meeting in this mood of happy , almost childlike anticipation . Indeed , in the past there have been times when , having spent hours getting made up for the luncheon engagement , she would emerge from the bathroom in her drabbest robe , announcing herself unable to leave the house to see anyone . " I look hideous . " " You do n't at all . " " 1 do , " and with that returns to bed for the day . Donald Garland , she tells me now , is " the kindest man " she has ever known . " I was taken to lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we were the best of friends from then on . We just adored each other . The center of the table was strewn with orchids he 'd picked from his garden . In my honor , he said . There were parrots and macaws in the trees in his garden , and the patio where we ate looked out over the crescent of Repulse Bay . I was eighteen years old . He must have been about fifty-five . My God . Donald is seventy ! I could never believe he was over forty ; he was always so happy , so youthful , so thrilled with everything . He lived with the most easygoing and good-natured American boy . Chips must have been about twenty-six or - sever then . On the phone this afternoon Donald told the most terrible news  --  one morning two months age Chips died of an aneurysm at breakfast ; just keelec over dead . Donald took the body back to Wilming ton , Delaware , and buried it , and then found la could n't leave . He kept hooking on the plane an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way home . " Chips , Donald , Edgar , Brian , Johnny ... I hay , no response to make , no interrogations or cross-ex amination , nothing faintly resembling sympathy curiosity , or interest . Or patience . I had long ag. heard all I could stand about the doings of th wealthy Hong Kong circle of English homosexual who had " adored " her . 1 exhibit only a churlis sort of surprise to find that I am to be a party to thi very special reunion . She shuts her eyes tightly , a though she must obliterate me momentarily fror sight just in order to survive . " Do n't talk to me lik that . Do n't take that terrible tone . He was nay clea : est friend . He saved my life a hundred times . " An why did you risk it a hundred times ? But the terrogatory accusation , and the terrible tone tin goes with it , I manage to squelch , for by now eve I know that I am being diminished far more 13 my anger at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hers I ought to have learned to di regard , or to have accepted with a certain grac long , long ago ... Only as the evening wears o and Garland becomes increasingly spirited in h reminiscences , do I wonder if she has invited hi to the apartment so that I might learn at first har just how very far from the apex she has fallen I insanely joining her fate to this fogy 's . Whether not that is her intention , it is something like tl result . In their company I am no easygoing , goo natured Chips , but entirely the Victorian sehoohnz ter whose heart stirs only to the crack of the wh and the swish of the cane . In a vain attempt to for this pious , sour , censorious little prig out of n skin , I try hard to believe that Helen is simp showing this man who has meant so much to h and been so kind to her , and who has himself jt suffered a terrible blow , that all is well in her li : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that her ? protector has n't to wor about her any longer . Yes , Helen is only acting would any devoted daughter who wished to span doting father some harsh truth .... In short : simi as the explanation for Garland 's presence miE have seemed to someone else , it is wholly beyo my grasp , as though now that living with Helen ceased to make any sense at all , I can not disco ' the truth about anything . T SEVENTY , DELICATE , small-boned GarInd still does have a youthful sort of charm , and a , ay about him at once worldly and boyish . His foreead is so fragile-looking it seems it could be cracked ith the tap of a spoon , and his cheeks are the small , Aind , glazed cheeks of an alabaster Cupid . Above le open shirt a pale silk scarf is tied around his eck , and almost completely hides from view the troat whose creases are the only strong sign of his ; e . In that strangely youthful face all there is to mak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awash ith feeling , even while his crisp accent refuses to ; tray the faintest hint of grief . " Poor Derek was killed , you know . " Helen did ) t know . She puts her hand to her mouth . " But , w ? Derek , " she says , turning to me , " was an as-.ciate in Donald 's firm . A very silly man some ? nes , very muddled and so on , but such a good . art , really ? " My dead expression sends her quick-back to Garland . " Yes , " he says , " he was a very nd person , and I was devoted to him . Oh , he old talk and go on , but then you just had to tell tn , ' Derek , that 's enough now , ' and he 'd shut up . ell , two Chinese boys thought that he had n't giv- them enough money , so they kicked him down flight of stairs . Broke Derek 's neck . " " How ter-de . How awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks den , " has happened to all his animals ? " " The rds are gone . Some sort of virus wiped them out a week after he was killed . The rest Madge adopted . sdge adopted them and Patricia looks after them . herwise , those two wo n't have anything to do th each other . " " Again ? " " Oh yes . She can be good bitch , that Madge , when she wants to be . ips did her house over for her a year ago . She irly drove the poor boy crazy with her upstairs th . " Helen tries yet again to bring me into the npany of the living : she explains that Madge and tricia , who own houses down along the bay from nald , were stars of British films in the Forties . nald rattles off the names of the movies they de . I nod and nod , but the smile I make a stab at senting him does not begin to come off . The look len has for me does , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Helen asks him . " Well , when she makes up , she still looks wonderful . She ought never to wear a bikini , of course . " I say , " Why ? " but no one seems to hear me . The evening ends with Garland , by now a little drunk , holding Helen 's hand and telling me about a famous masquerade party held in a jungle clearing on a small island in the Gulf of Siam , half a mile out to sea from the southern finger of Thailand , and owned by a Thai friend of his . Chips , who designed Helen 's costume , had put her all in white , like Prince Ivan in The Firebird . " She was ravishing . A silk cossack shirt and full silk trousers gathered into soft silver kid boots , and a silver turban with a diamond clasp . And around her waist a jeweled belt of emeralds . " Emeralds ? Bought by whom ? Obviously by Karenin . Where is it now , I wonder . What do you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly get to keep the memories , that 's for sure . " A little Thai princess burst into tears at the very sight of her . Poor little thing . She 'd come wearing everything but the kitchen stove and expected people to swoon . But the one who looked like royalty that night was this dear girl . Oh , it was quite a to-do . Has n't Helen ever shown you the photographs ? Do n't you have photographs , dear ? " " No , " she says , " not any more . " " Oh , I wish I 'd brought mine . But I never thought i 'd see you --  -- 1 did n't even know who I was when I left . And remember the little boys ? " he says , after a long sip from his brandy glass . " Chips , of course , got all the little native boys stripped down , with just a little coconut shell around their how-deedos , and Christmas tinsel streaming down around their necks . What a sight they were when the wind blew ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little chaps to greet the guests and to lead us up a torch-lined path to the clearing where we had the banquet . Oh , my goodness , yes  --  Madge came in the dress that Derek wore for his fortieth birthday party . Never would spend money , if she could help it . Always angry about something , but mostly it 's the money everyone 's stealing from her . She said , You ca n't just go to one of these things , you have to have something wonderful to wear . ' So I said to her , only as a joke , mind you , Why do n't you come in Derek 's dress ? It 's white chiffon covered with diamante and with a long train . And cut very low in the back . You 'll look lovely in it , darling . ' And Madge said , ' How could it be cut low in the back , Donald ? How in the world could Derek have worn it ? What about the hair on his back , and all that disgusting rubbish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he only shaves once every three years . ' You see , " Garland says to me , " Derek was rather the old Guards officer type  --  slim , elegant , very pink-complexioned , altogether the most extraordinarily hairless person . Oh , there 's a photograph of Helen you must see , David . I must send it to you . It 's Helen being led from the boat by these enchanting little native boys streaming Christmas tinsel . With her long legs and all that silk clinging to her , oh , she was absolute perfection . And her face  --  her face in that photograph is classic . I must send it to you ; you must have it . She was the most ravishing thing . Patricia said about Helen , the first moment she laid eyes on her  --  that was at lunch at my house , and the darling girl still had the most ordinary little clothes  --  but Patricia said then she had star quality , that without a doubt she could be a film star . And she could have been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know , " replies the schoolmaster , silently swishing his cane . After he leaves , Helen says , " Well , there 's no need to ask what you thought of him , is there ? " " It 's as you said : he adores you . " " Really , just what has empowered you to sit in judgment of other people 's passions ? Have n't you heard ? It 's a wide , wide world ; room for everybody to do whatever he likes .. Even you once did what you liked , David . Or so the story goes . " " I sit in judgment of nothing . What I sit in judgment of you would n't believe . " " Ah , yourself . Hardest on yourself . Momentarily I forgot . " " I sat , Helen , and I listened and I do n't remember saying anything about the passions or preferences or private parts of anybody from here to Nepal . " " Donald Garland is probably the kindest man alive . " " Fine with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were weeks when I went to live in his house . He protected inc from some terrible people . " Why did n't you just protect yourself by staying away from them ? " Good , " I say ; " you were lucky and that was great . " " He likes to gossip and to tell tales , and of course he got a little maudlin tonight  --  look what he 's just been through . But he happens to know what people are , just how much and just how little  --  and he is devoted to his friends , even the fools . The loyalty of those kind of men is quite wonderful , and not to be disparaged . And do n't you be misled . When he is feeling himself he can be like iron . He can be unmovable , and marvelous . " " I am sure he was a wonderful friend to you . " " He still is ! " " Look , what arc you trying to tell me ? I do n't always get the gist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to give me the final exam , to see if they 've been able to get anything through my skull . What are we talking about now ? " " About the fact that I am still a person of consequence to quite a few people , even if to you and the learned professors and their peppy , dowdy little wives I am beneath contempt . It 's true I 'm not clever enough to bake banana bread and carrot bread and raise my own bean sprouts and ' audit ' seminars and ' head up ' committees to outlaw war for all time , but peo ? ple still look at me wherever I go . I could have married the kind of men who run the world ! I would n't have had to look far , either . I hate to have to say such a vulgar , trashy thing about my self , but it 's what you 're reduced to saying to some one who finds you repulsive . " " I do n't find yoi repulsive . I 'm still awestruck that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone unabh even to finish a little pamphlet on Anton Chekhoi feel anything but gratitude to be living with tir woman who turned down being queen of Tibet ? I'n honored to have been chosen to be your hair shirt . ' " It 's debatable who is the hair shirt around here . am repugnant to you , Donald is repugnant to you ? ' " Helen , I neither liked the man nor disliked th. man . I did my level fucking best . Look , my bes friend as long ago as college was practically the on ly queer there . I had a queer for a friend in 1951 ? before they even existed ! I did n't know what on was , but I had one . I do n't care who wears whos dress  --  oh , fork it , forget it , I quit .

Several days pass hi . eons days , involving two visits to the San Francis ( morgue , one with Helen 's demure , bewildered mot er , who insists on flying up from Pasadena ar bravely coming along with me to look at the broke body of a drowned " Caucasian " woman , age thin to thirty-five  --  before I learn that she is back in tl Far East . The first telephone call informing me that Hel . is in a Hung Kong jail is from the State Depa went . The second call is from Garland , who ad certain lurid and clarifying details : she had go from the Hong Kong airport directly by taxi to t Nell-known ex-lover 's mansion in Kowloon . He is he English Onassis , I am told , son and heir of the rounder of the MacDonald-Metcalf Line , and king of he cargo routes from the Cape of Good Hope to Manila Bay . At Jimmy Metcalf 's home , she had not ? yen been allowed past the servant posted at the loor , not after her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , some hours later , she left ier hotel to tell the police of the plan made some ears earlier by the president of MacDonald-Metcalf o have this wife run down by a car , the officer on luty at the police station made a telephone call and ubsequently a packet of cocaine was found in her . urse . " What happens now ? " I ask him . " My God , tonald , now what ? " " I get her out , " says Garland . " Can that be done ? " " It can . " " How ? " " How would you think ? " Money ? Blackmail ? Girls ? Boys ? I do n't know , do n't care , I wo n't ask again . Whatever works , do " The question , " says Garland , " is what happens hen Helen is free ? I can , of course , make her quite mifortable right here . I can provide her with all le needs to pull herself together again , and to go i . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . he can not afford to be caught in between again . " " In between what ? Donald , this is all a little conising . I have no idea what 's best , frankly . Tell me , ease , why did n't she go to you when she got ere ? " " Because she got it in her head to sec Jimmy . ie knew that if she 'd come first to me I would nevhave let her go anywhere near him . I know the an , better than she does . " " And you knew she was coming ? " " Yes , of course . " " The night you were here for dinner . " " No , no , my dear boy . Only a week ago . But she is to have cabled . I would have been at the airport meet her . But she did it Helen 's way . " " She should n't have , " I say dumbly .

I 'm lucky I could . We 're lucky she is n't in irons already and halfway to Malaysia . Our police chief is not the most charitable of men , except on his own behalf . And your rival is not Albert Schweitzer . " " That is apparent . " " She used to tell me , ' It 's so difficult to go shopping with Jimmy . If I see something I like , he buys me twelve .

He does everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't want anything further to go wrong for Helen  --  ever , " says Garland . " I want to know exactly where Helen stands , and I want to know now . She has been through years of hell . She was a marvelous , darling creature , and life has treated her hideously . I wo n't allow either one of you to torture her again . " But I ca n't tell him where she stands  --  I do n't know where / stand . First , I say , I must reach Helen 's family and calm their fears . He will hear from me . Will he ? Why ? As though I have just reported that her daughter has been detained by a club meeting after school , Helen 's mother says , politely , " And when will she be home ? " " I do n't know . " But this does not appear to faze the adventuress 's mother . " I do hope you 'll keep me informed , " she says , brightly . " I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David . " What else can the mother of an adventuress do but thank people for calling and keeping her informed ? And what does the husband of an adventuress do while his wife is in jail in the Far East ? Well , at dinnertime 1 prepare an omelette , make it very carefully , at just the right heat , and serve it to myself with a little chopped parsley , a glass of wine , and a slice of buttered toast . Then I take a long hot shower . He does n't want me to torture her ; all right , I wo n't torture her  --  but best of all , I wo n't torture myself . After the shower I decide to get into my pajamas and to do my night 's reading in bed , all by myself . No girls , not yet . That will come in its own sweet time . Everything will . Can it be ? I am back where I was six years ago , the night before I ditched my sensible date and took Hong Kong Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my job , I have my book to complete , and I seem to have this comfortable apartment , so charmingly and tastefully decorated , all to myself . What is Mauriac 's phrase ? " To revel in the pleasures of the unshared bed . " For some four hours my happiness is complete . Have I ever heard or read of something like this happening , of a person being catapulted out of his misery directly into bliss ? The common wisdom has it that it works the other way around . Well , I am here to say that on rare occasion it seems to work this way too . My God , I do feel good . I will not torture her , or myself , ever again . Fine with me .

It must be that I want her back , that I ca n't give her up , that I am in love with her whether I 've known it or not , that she is my destiny Not one word of this stuff convinces me . Most are words I despise : Helen 's kind of words , Helen 's kind of thinking . I ca n't live without this , he ca n't live without that , my woman , my man , my destiny ... Kid stuff ! Movie stuff ! Screen Romance ! Yet if this woman is not my woman , what am I doing here ? If she is not my destiny , why was I on the phone from 2:00 to 5:00 A.M. ? Is it just that pride wo n't permit me to abdicate to her homosexual protector ? No , that 's not what 's done it . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or masochism , or vindictive glee ...

Accompanied by Garland grim , courteous , im-peccably now the banker and businessman  --  a Hong Kong police detective , and the clean-cut young man from the American consulate who is also there to meet my airplane , I am taken to the jail to see my wife . As we leave the terminal for the car , I say to Garland , " I thought she was to be out by now . " " The negotiations , " he says , " seem to involve more interests than we had imagined .

I have never loved her quite like that down on the ground be fore , and I 'm not going to start in a jail . I am no that kind of an idiot .

" Yes , I 'll bet you ere , " she says , serene in a dopey sort of way , now at the whiskey has somewhat dimmed the horrors incarceration and she is beyond the nightmare of mmy Metcalf 's revenge . I do n't bother to answer m way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last year there is nothing to say ; she ould only laugh if I were to tell her who her rivals Id been . Nor could I expect much sympathy were I try to explain to her how unsatisfying it had been to ! ceiye her with women who had n't a hundredth of : r appeal to me  --  who had n't a hundredth of her laracter , let alone her loveliness  --  and whose faces could have spit into when I realized how much of eir satisfaction derived from putting Helen Ke. : sh in her place . Quickly enough  --  almost quickenough  --  I had seen that deceiving a wife as dis:ed as Helen was by other women just was n't ? ng to be possible without humiliating myself in P process . I had n't a Jimmy Metcalf 's gift for Idly rearing back and delivering the grand and tal blow to my opponent ; no , vengeance was his de , and contentious melancholia was mine . . . Hel 's speech is badly slurred from the liquor , and from haustion , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change of clothes , and a chance to make her face , she intends to have a conversation , r first in days and days . She intends now to re-me her place in the world , and not as the vanished , but as herself . " Well , " she says , " you i n't have to be such a good boy , you know . You uld have had your affairs , if that would have : de you any happier . I could have taken it . " ood to know that , " I say . " It 's you who would n't ye survived in one piece . You see , I 've been faithto you , whether you believe it or not . The only n I 've been faithful to in my life . " Do I believe t ? Can I ? And if I should ? Where does that leave ? I say nothing . " You do n't know yet where I ad to go sometimes after my exercise class . " " No , lo n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rning wearing my favorite dress . " ' 1 had my as . " " Well , they were wrong . I had no lover . Nevnever with you . Because it would have been too eons . You could n't have taken it . You would ' e been crushed , you would have forgiven me , 1 you would never have been yourself again . You rld have gone around bleeding forever . " " I went and bleeding anyway . We both went around sding . Where did you go all dressed up ? " " I it out to the airport . " " And ? " " And I sat in the Am waiting room . I had my passport in my a:lbag . And my jewelry . I sat there reading the ' er until somebody asked if I wanted to have a drink in the first-class lounge . " " And I 'll bet somebody always did . " Always  --  that 's right . And I 'd go there and have a drink . We would talk ... and then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South America , to Africa , everywhere . A man even asked me to come with him on a business trip to Hong Kong . But I never did it . Instead , I came back home and you started in on me about the checkbook stubs . " " You did this how often ? " " Often enough , " she replies . " Enough for what to see if you still had the power ? " " No , you idiot , to see if you still had the power . " She begins to sob . " Will it startle you , " she asks , " to hear that I think we should have had that baby ? " " I would n't have risked it , not with you . " My words knock the wind out of her , what wind is left . " Oh , you shit , that was unnecessary , there are less cruel ways ... " she says . " Oh , why did n't I let Jimmy kill her when he wanted to ! " she cries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her now  --  she stood there , ten feet inside the hallway , glaring out at me . You should see her  --  she looks like a whale ! " That beautiful man goes to bed with a whale ! " " I said quiet down . " " He told them to plant cocaine on me  --  on me , the person he loves ! He let them take my purse and steal my money ! And how I loved that man ! I only left him to save him from committing a murder ! And now he hates me for being too decent , and you despise me for being indecent , and the truth of it is that I 'm better and stronger and braver than both of you . At least I was  --  and I was when I was only twenty years old ! You would n't risk a baby with me ? What about someone like you ? Hid it ever occur to you that about a baby , it may have been the other way around ? No ? Yes ? Answer me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little sparrow you do take the risk with . If only you had taken it into your hands long ago , years ago  --  at the beginning ! I should have had nothing to say about it ! " " Helen , you 're exhausted and you 're loaded and you do n't know what the hell you 're saying . A lot you cared about having a baby . " " A lot I did , you fool , you dope ! Oh , why ever did I come on this airplane with you ! I could have stayed with Donald ! He needs someone as much as I do . I should have stayed with him in his house , and told you to go home . Oh , why did I lose my nerve in that jail ! " " You lost it because of your friend Jimmy . You thought when you got out he 'd kill you . " " But he would n't  --  that was crazy ! He only did what he did because he loves me so , and I loved him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've waited for you for six years ! Why did n't you take me into your world like a man ! " " Maybe you mean why did n't I take you out of yours . I could n't . The only kind who could take you out is the kind who took you in . Sure , I know about my terrible tone , and the scornful looks I can give , but I never went and got a hit man in about the toast , you know . Next time you want to be saved from a tyrant , find another tyrant to do the job . I admit defeat . " " Oh , God , oh , Jesus God , why must they be either brutes or choirboys ? Stewardess , " she says , grabbing the girl 's arm as she passes in the aisle , " I do n't want a drink , I 've had enough . I only want to ask a question of you . Do n't be frightened . Why are they either brutes or choirboys , do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you find that in your travels from one continent to the other ? They 're even afraid , you know , of a sweet little thing like you . That 's why you have to go around grinning like that . Just look the bastards right in the eye and they 're either at your knees or at your throat . " HEN AT LAST Helen has fallen asleep  --  her face rolling familiarly on my shoulder ? I take the final exams out of my briefcase and begin where I had to leave off 100 or so hours ago . Yes , I have taken my schoolwork with me  --  and a good thing too . I can not imagine how I could get through the remaining fourteen hours of the flight without these examination papers to hang on to . " Without this ... " and see myself strangling Helen with the coil of her waist-long hair . Who strangles his wife with her hair ? Is n't it somebody somewhere in Browning ? Oh , who cares ! " The search for intimacy , not because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is one of Chekhov 's recurrent themes . " The paper I have chosen to begin with -- to begin again with  --  is by Kathie Steiner , the girl I had dreamed of adopting . " Good , " I write in the margin alongside of her opening sentence ; then I reread it and after " necessary " make an insertion mark and write , " for survival ( ? ) " And all the while I am thinking , " And miles below are the beaches of Polynesia . Well , dear , dazzling creature , a lot of good that does us ! Hong Kong ! The whole damn thing could have taken place in Cincinnati ! A hote room , a police station , an airport . A vengeful mega lomaniac and some crooked cops ! And a would-b . Cleopatra ! Our savings gone on this trashy grade 13 thriller ! Oh , this voyage is the marriage itself  --  traversing 4,000 miles of the exotic globe twit over , and for no good reason at all ! " Struggling to fix my attention once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen and should have had a child , or Who is to blame be cause we did n't  --  refusing to charge myself ye again with all I could have done that I did n't de and all I did that I should n't have  --  I return t Kathie Steiner 's final exam . Jimmy Metcalf instruct the police , " Kick her ass a little , it 'll do the whor some good , " while I subdue my emotions b reading carefully through each of Kathie 's page : correcting every last comma fault , reminding he about her dangling modifier problem , and dutiful ) filling the margin with my commentary and que tions . Me and my " finals , " my marking pen and en paper clips . How the emperor Metcalf would el joy the spectacle  --  likewise Donald Garland and tt uncharitable chief of police . I suppose I ought laugh a little myself ; but as I am a professor and nt a policeman , as I am someone who long ago squeeze out what little of the tyrant was ever in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out just a bit to much instead of laughing , I come to Kathie 's co : eluding sentence , and am undone . The hold I ha , had on myself since Helen 's disappearance dissolv. like that , and I must turn my face and press it in the darkened window of the humming airship that carrying us back home to complete , in orderly ar legal fashion , the disentanglement of our two wreck lives . I cry for myself , I cry for Helen . and final I seem to cry hardest of all from the realizatit that somehow not every last thing has been d stroyed , that despite my consuming obsession wi my marital unhappiness and my dreamy desire call out to my young students for their help , I ha somehow gotten a sweet , chubby , unharmed , a as yet unhorrified daughter of Beverly Hills to el her sophomore year of college by composing tl grim and beautiful lament summarizing what s calls " Anton Chekhov 's overall philosophy of life But can Professor Kepesh have taught her thi How ?
