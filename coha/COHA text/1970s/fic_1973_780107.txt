 | Minds and motives were slowly changing gears . Frivolity was ebbing ; there were more serious things to consider . And the steady flow of house guests diminished at High Barnegat . It was four-thirty in the afternoon , and Phyllis Trevayne reclined in a lounge chair on the terrace , letting the warm sun wash over her body . She thought , with a degree of satisfaction , that her daughter 's bathing suit fitted her rather comfortably . Since she was forty-two and her daughter seventeen , satisfaction could have turned into minor triumph if she allowed herself to dwell on it . But she could n't because her thoughts kept returning to the telephone , to the call from New York for Andrew . She had answered on the terrace phone , because the cook was still in town with the children and her husband was still a small white sail far out on the water . She 'd nearly let the phone ring unanswered , but only very good friends and very important  --  her husband preferred the word " necessary " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Trevayne ? " had asked the deep voice on the other end of the line . " Yes ? " " Frank Baldwin here . How are you , Phyllis ? " " Fine , just fine , Mr. Baldwin . And you ? " Phyllis Trevayne had known Franklyn Baldwin for several years , but she still could n't bring herself to call the old gentleman by his first name . Baldwin was the last of a dying breed , one of the original giants of New York banking . " I 'd be a lot better if I knew why your husband has n't returned my calls . Is he all right ? Not that I 'm so important , God knows , but he 's not ill , is he ? " " Oh , no . Not at all . He 's been away from the office over a week now . He has n't taken any messages . I 'm really to blame ; I wanted him to rest . " " My wife used to cover for me that way , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and always with the right words . " Phyllis Trevayne laughed pleasantly , aware of the compliment . " Really , it 's true , Mr. Baldwin . Right now the only reason I know he 's not working is that I can see the sail of the cat , mnaran a mile or so offshore . " " A cat ! God ! I forget how young you are ! In my day no one your age ever got so damned rich . Not by themselves . " " We 're lucky . We never forget it . " Phyllis Trcvsync 's voice spoke the truth .  | " That 's a very nice thing to say , young lady . " Franklyn Baldwin also spoke the truth , and he wanted her to know that . " Well , when Captain Ahab bounds ashore , do ask him to call me , will you , please ? It 's really most urgent . " " I certainly shall . " " Good-bye , my dear . " " Good-bye , Mr. Baldwin . " But her husband had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned dozens of calls to far less important people than Franklyn Baldwin . Besides which , Andrew liked Baldwyn ; he 'd said so a number of times . He 'd gone to Baldwin on many occasions for guidance in the tangled webs of international finance . Her husband owed a great deal to the banker , and now the old gentleman needed him . Why had n't Andrew returned the calls ? It simply was n't like him . The restaurant was small , seating no more than forty people , and situated on Thirty-eighth Street between Park and Madison avenues . Its clientele was generally from the ranks of the approaching-middleage executives with suddenly more money than they 'd ever made before and a desire , a need , perhaps , to hold on to their younger outlooks . The food was only fair , its prices high , and the drinks were expensive . However , the bar area was wide , and the rich paneling reflected the soft , indirect lighting . The effect was a throwback to all those collegiate is from the fifties that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that in mind . Considering this , and he always considered it , the manager was slightly surprised to see a short , well-dressed man in his early sixties walk hesitantly through the door . The man looked around , adjusting his eyes to the dim light . The manager approached him . " A table , sir ? " " No .... Yes , I 'm meeting someone . . . . Never mind , thank you . We have one . " The well-dressed man spotted the person he was looking for at a table in the rear . He walked abruptly away from the manager and sidled awkwardly past the crowded chairs . The manager recalled the man at the rear table . He 'd insisted on that particular table . The elderly man sat down . " It might have been better to meet someplace other than a restaurant . "  | " Do n't worry , Mr. Allen . No one you know comes here . " " I certainly hope you 're right . " A waiter approached , and the order was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be concerned , " said the younger man . " It strikes me that I 'm the one taking the risk , not you . " " You 'll be taken care of ; you know that . Let 's not waste time . Where do things stand ? " " The commission has unanimously approved Andrew Trevayne . " " He wo n't take it . " " The feeling is that he will . Baldwin 's to make the offer ; he may have done so already . " " If he has , then you 're late . " The old man creased the flesh around his eyes and stared at the tablecloth . " We heard the rumors ; we assumed they were a smokescreen . We relied on you . " He looked up at Webster . " It was our understanding that you would confirm the identity before any final action was taken . " " I could n't control it ; no one at the White House could . That commission 's off-limits . I was lucky to zero in on the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Why do they think Trevayne will accept ? Why should he ? His Danforth Foundation is damn near as big as Ford or Rockefeller . Why would he give it up ? " Allen asked . " He probably wo n't . Just take a leave of absence . " " No foundation the size of Danforth would accept a leave for that length of time . Especially not for a job like this . They 're all in trouble . " " I do n't follow you .... " " You think they 're immune ? " asked Allen , interrupting . " They need friends in your town . Not enemies . . . . What 's the procedure ? If Baldwin has made the offer . If Trevayne accepts ? " The waiter returned with the drinks and both men fell silent . He left , and Webster answered . " The conditions are that whoever the commission selects receives the President 's approval and is subject to a closed hearing with a bipartisan committee in the Senate . " " All right , all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of his drink . " Let 's work from there ; we can do something there . We 'll disqualify him at the hearing . " The younger man looked puzzled . " Why ? What 's the point ? Someone 's going to chair that subcommittee . I gather this Trevayne 's at least a reasonable man . " " You gather ! " Allen finished his drink rapidly . " Just what have you gathered ? What do you know about Trevayne ? " " What I 've read . I did my research . He and his brother-in-law  - -   the brother 's an electronics engineer  --  started a small company dealing in aerospace research and manufacturing in New Haven in the middle fifties . They hit the motherlode seven or eight years later ; they were both millionaires by the time they were thirty-five . The brother-in-law designed , while Trevayne sold the hell out of the products . He cornered half the early NASA contracts and set up subsidiaries all over the Atlantic seaboard . Trevayne pulled out when he was thirty-seven and took on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whale of a job for State . " Webster raised his glass , looking over the rim at Allen . The young man expected to be complimented on his knowledge . Instead , Allen dismissed his companion 's words . " Shit . Timemagazine material . What 's important is that Trevayne 's an original ... . le does n't cooperate . We know ; we tried reaching him years ago . " " Oh ? " Webster put his glass down . " I did n't realize ... Oh , Christ . Then he knows ? " " Not a great deal ; perhaps enough . We 're not sure . But you still miss the point , Mr. Webster . It seems to me that you 've missed the point from the beginning . . . . We do n't want him chairing that goddamned subcommittee . We do n't want him or anyone like him ! That kind of choice is unthinkable . " " What can you do about that ? " " Force him out . . . if he 's actually accepted . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn sure he 's rejected . " " Say you succeed , then what ? " " We 'll nominate our own man . What should have been done in the first place . " Allen signaled the waiter , gesturing at both glasses . " Mr. Allen , why did n't you stop him ? If you were in a position to do that , why did n't you ? You said you heard the rumors about Trevayne ; that was the time to step in . " Allen avoided Webster 's look . He drained the ice water in his glass , and when he spoke , his voice had the sound of a man trying very hard to maintain his authority ; with lessening success . " Frank Baldwin , that 's why . Frank Baldwin and that senile son-of-a-bitch Hill . " " The Ambassador ? " " The goddamned Ambassador-at-large with his goddamned embassy in the White House . . . . Big Billy Hill ! Baldwin and Hill ; they 're the relics behind this bullshit . Hill has been circling like a hawk for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Defense Commission . Between them they picked Trevayne . . . . Baldwin put up his name ; who the hell could argue ? . . . But you should have told us it was final . If we 'd been certain , we could have prevented it . " Webster watched Allen closely . When he replied , there was a hard- ness he had n't displayed before . " And I think you 're lying . Somebody else blew it ; you or one of the other so-called specialists . First , you thought this investigation would burn itself out in the forming , he killed in committee . . . . You were wrong . And then it was too late . Trevayne surfaced , and you could n't stop it . You 're not even sure you can stop him now . That 's why you wanted to see me . . . . So let 's dispense with this crap about my being late and missing the point , shall we ? " " You watch your tongue , young man . Just remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commensurate strength . " And you remember that you 're talking to a man personally appointed by the President of the United States . You may not like it , but that 's why you came to me . Now , what is it ? What do you want ? " Allen exhaled slowly , as if to rid himself of anger . " Some of us are more alarmed than others ... " " You 're one of them , " interjected Webster quietly . " Yes . . . . Trevayne 's a complicated man . One-part boy genius of industry  --  which means he knows his way around the board rooms ; onepart skeptic  --  he does n't subscribe to certain realities . " " Seems to me those assets go together . " " Only when a man 's dealing from strength . " " Get to the point . What 's Trevayne 's strength ? " " Let 's say he never needed assistance . " " Let 's say he refused it . " " All right , all right . That 's valid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . When I was with . . . Never mind . It was the early sixties ; we were consolidating then and thought he might be a valuable addition to our . . . community . We even offered to guarantee the NASA contracts . " " Sweet Jesus ! And he turned you down . " Webster made a pronouncement , not an inquiry . " He strung us along for a while , then realized he could get the contracts without us . As soon as he knew that , he told us to go to hell . Actually , he went a lot further . He told me to tell my people to get out of the space program , get out of the government money . He threatened to go to the Attorney General . " Bobby Webster absently picked up his fork and slowly made indentations on the tablecloth . " Suppose it had been the other way around ? Suppose he had needed you ? Would he have joined your ' com-munity ' ? " " That 's what we do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't talk to him ; I did . I was the intermediary . I was the only one he really had .... I never used names , never said who my people Were . " But you believe the fact that they were was enough ? For him . " " The unanswerable question . He threatened us after he got his ; he was sure he did n't need anyone but himself , his brother-in-law , and hilt goddamned company in New Haven . We simply ca n't afford to take the chance now . We ca n't allow him to chair that subcommittee ... . Ile 's unpredictable . " " What am I supposed to do ? " " ' Take every reasonable risk to get close to Trevayne . The optimum would be for you to be his White House connection . Is that pos-sible ? " Bobby Webster paused , then answered firmly . " Yes . The President brought me into the session on the subcommittee . It was a classified meeting ; no notes , no transcripts . There was only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " " You understand , it may not be necessary . Certain preventive measures will be taken . If they 're effective , Trevayne will be out of the picture . " " I can help you there . " " How ?

Or want to acknowledge . " " He 's out . " " It would n't hurt to establish a minor friendship . If you 're offended , think of the Senate . " Allen 's wrinkled frown dissolved . He looked almost appreciatively at the presidential aide . " I see what you mean . " " Of course , it will raise my price considerably . " " I thought you believed in what you 're doing . " " I believe in protecting my flanks . The best protection is to make you pay . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very talented . "  | ANDREW TREVAYNE ran the twin hulls of the catamaran before the wind , catching the fast current into the shore . He stretched his long legs against a connecting spar and reached over the tiller to make an additional wake in the stern flow . No reason , just a movement , a meaningless gesture . The water was warm ; his hand felt as though it was being propelled through a tepid , viscous film . Just as he was being propelled  --  inexorably propelled  --  into an enigma that was not of his choosing . Yet the final decision would be his , and he knew what his choice would be . That was the most irritating aspect ; he understood the furies that propelled him , and he disliked himself for even contemplating submission to them . He had put them behind him . Long ago . The cat was within a hundred yards of the Connecticut shoreline when the wind abruptly shifted  --  as winds do when buffeted against solid ground from open water . Trevayne swung his legs over the starboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swerved and lurched to the right toward the dock . Trevayne was a large man . Not immense , just larger than most men , with the kind of supple coordination that bespoke of a far more active youth than he ever bothered to reminisce about . He remembered reading an article in Newsweek , surprised at the descriptions of his former playing-field prowess . They 'd been greatly exaggerated , as all such descriptions were in such articles . He 'd been good , but not that good . He always had the feeling that he looked better than he was , or his efforts camouflaged his shortcomings . But he knew he was a good sailor . Maybe more than good . The rest was meaningless to hint . It always had been , except for the instant of competition .  | ' there would be intolerable competition facing him now . If he made the decision . The kind of competition that allowed no quarter , that involved strategies not listed in any rulebook . He was good at those strategies , too . But not from participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Understand them , be capable of maneuver , even skirt the edges , but never participate . Instead , use the knowledge to gain the advantage . Use it without mercy , without quarter . Andrew kept a small pad fastened to a steel plate on the deck next to the tiller . Attached to the plate was a thin rust-proof chain that housed a waterproof casing with a ball-point pen . He said these were for recording times , markers , wind velocities  --  whatever . Actually , the pad and pen were for jotting down stray thoughts , ideas , memoranda for himself . Sometimes things . . . just " things " that seemed clearer to him while on the water . Which was why he was upset when he looked down at the pad now . He had written one word . Written it unconsciously , without realizing it . Boston . He ripped off the page , crumpled it with far more intensity that the action called for , and threw it into the sound . Goddamn ! Goddamn it ! he thought . No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the side and held the edge of the dock with his right hand . With his left he pulled the release sheet , and the sail fluttered as it buckled . He secured the boat and stood up , pulling down the rest of the canvas , rolling it around the horizontal mast as he did so . In less than four minutes he had dismantled the tiller , stowed the jacket , lashed the sail , and tied off the boat at four corners . He looked up beyond the stone wall of the terrace to the wood and glass structure that jutted from the edge of the hill . It never ceased to excite him . Not the material possession ; that was n't important any longer . But that it had all come out the way he and Phyl planned it . They had done it together ; that fact was very important . It might never make up for other things , perhaps . Sadder things . But it helped . He walked to the stone path by the boathouse and started up the steep incline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shape he was in by the time he reached-midpoint of the climb . If he was out of breath , or his legs ached , he would silently vow to eat less or exercise more . He was pleased to find that there was little discomfort now . Or perhaps his mind was too preoccupied to relate the stress .  | No , he was feeling pretty good , he thought . The week away from the office , the continuous salt air , the pleasantly energetic end of the summer months ; he was feeling fine . And then he remembered the pad and the unconsciously  --  subconsciously  --  written word . Boston . He did n't really feel fine at all . He rounded the last steps to the flagstone terrace and saw that his wife was lying back in a deck chair , her eyes open , staring out at the water , seeing nothing he would see . He always felt a slight ache when he watched her like that . The ache of sad , painful memories . Because of Boston , goddamn it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his steps ; he did n't want to startle her . " Hi , " he said softly . " Oh ? " Phyllis blinked . " Have a good sail , darling ? " " Fine . Good sleep ? " Trevayne crossed over to her and kissed her lightly on her forehead . " Great while it lasted . It was interrupted . " " Oh ? I thought the kids drove Lillian into town . " " It was n't the kids . Or Lillian . " " You sound ominous . " Trevayne reached into a large rectangular cooler on the patio table and withdrew a can of beer . " Not ominous . But I am curious . " " What are you talking about ? " He ripped off the flip-top on the can and drank . " Franklyn Baldwin telephoned . . . . Why have n't you returned his calls ? " Trevayne held the beer next to his lips and looked at his wife . " Have n't I seen that bathing suit on someone else ? " " Yes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and I 'd still like to know why you have n't called him . " " I 'm trying to avoid him . " " I thought you liked him . " " I do . Immensely . All the more reason to avoid him . He 's going to ask me for something , and I 'm going to refuse him . At least , I think he 'll ask me , and I want to refuse him . " " What ? " Trevayne walked absently to the stone wall bordering the terrace and rested the beer can on the edge . " Baldwin wants to recruit me . That 's the rumor ; I think it 's called a trial balloon . ' He heads up that commission on defense spending . They 're forming a subcommittee to  | make what they politely phrase an ' in-depth study ' of Pentagon rela-tionships , " " What does that mean ? " " Four or five companies  --  conglomerates , really  --  are responsible fir seventy-odd percent of the defense budget . In one way or another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's supposed to be an investigative arm of the Defense Commission . They 're looking for a chairman . " " And you 're it ? " " I do n't want to be it . I 'm happy where I am . What I 'm doing now is positive ; chairing that committee would be the most negative thing I can think of . Whoever takes the job will be a national pariah . . . if he only half works at it . " " Why ? " " Because the Pentagon 's a mess . It 's no secret ; read the papers . Any day . It 's not even subtle . " " Then why would anyone be a pariah for trying to fix it ? I understand making enemies , not a national pariah . " Trevayne laughed gently as he carried the beer over to a chair next to his wife and sat down . " I love you for your New England simplicity . Along with the bathing suit . " " You 're pacing too much . Your thinking-feet are working overtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I 'm not interested . " " Then answer the question . Why a national pariah ? " " Because the mess is too ingrained . And widespread . To be at all effective , that subcommittee 's going to have to call a lot of people a lot of names . Fundamentally act on a large premise of fear . When you start talking about monopolies , you 're not just talking about influential men shuffling around stock issues . You 're threatening thousands and thousands of jobs . Ultimately , that 's any monopoly 's hold , from top to bottom . You exchange one liability for another . It may be necessary , but you cause a lot of pain . " " My God , " said Phyllis , sitting up . " You 've done a lot of thinking . " " Thinking , yes . Not doing . " Andrew bounced out of the chair and walked to the table , extinguishing his cigarette in an ashtray . " Frankly , I was surprised the whole idea got this far . These things  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  are usually proposed loudly and disposed of quietly . In the Senate cloakroom or the House dining room . This time it 's different . I wonder why . "  | " Ask Frank Baldwin . " " I 'd rather not . " " You should . You owe him that , Andy . Why do you think he chose you ? " Trevayne crossed back to the terrace wall and looked out over the Long Island Sound . " I 'm qualified ; Frank knows that . I 've dealt with those government-contract boys ; I 've been critical in print about the overruns , the open-end agreements . He knows that , too . I 've even been angry , but that goes back a long time ago . . . . Mainly , I think , because he knows how much I despise the manipulators . They 've ruined a lot of good men , one especially . Remember ? " Trevayne turned and looked at his wife . " They ca n't touch me now . I have n't a thing to lose but time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . " Trevayne lit a second cigarette and leaned against the ledge , his arms folded in front of him . He continued to stare at Phyllis . " I know . That 's why I 'm avoiding Frank Baldwin . " Trevayne pushed the omelet around the plate , not really interested in it . Franklyn Baldwin sat opposite him in the bank 's executive dining room . The old gentleman was speaking intensely . " The job 's going to get done , Andrew ; you know that . Nothing 's going to prevent it . I just want the best man to do it . And I think you 're the best man . I might add , the commission 's voice was unanimous . " " What makes you so sure the job 'll get done ? I 'm not . The Senate 's always yelling about economies ; it 's a hell of an issue , and always will be . That is , until a highway project or an aircraft plant is closed down in some district . Then suddenly the shouting stops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . I would n't have become involved if I thought otherwise . " " You 're expressing an opinion . There has to be something else , Frank . " Baldwin removed his steel-rimmed glasses and laid them beside his plate . He blinked several times and gracefully massaged the bridge of his patrician nose . He smiled a half-smile , half-sadly . " There is . You 're very perceptive . . . . Call it the legacy of two old men whose lives  --  and the lives of their families for a number of generations  --  have been made most pleasantly productive in this country of ours . I daresay we 've contributed , but the rewards have been more than ample . That 's the best way I can put it . " " I 'm afraid I do n't understand . "  | " Of course not . I 'll clarify . William Hill and I have known each oilier since childhood . " " Ambassador hill ? " " Yes .... I wo n't bore you with the eccentricities of our relationship not today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around too many more years ; not sure that I 'd want to ... . This Defense Cornmission , the subcommittee  --  they 're our ideas . We intend to see them become working realities . That much we can guarantee ; in our different ways we 're powerful enough to do that . And to use that dreadful term , sufficiently respectable . ' " " What do you think you 'll gain ? " the truth . The extent of the truth as we believe it to be . This country has the right to know that , no matter how much it may hurt . To cure any disease , a correct diagnosis has to be made . Not indiscriminate labels hung by self-righteous zealots , nor vindictive charges hurled by malcontents . . . . The truth , Andrew . Merely the truth . That gift will he ours , Billy 's and mine . Perhaps our last . " Trevayne had the desire to move , to be physically in motion . The old gentleman opposite him was succeeding in doing exactly what he thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor defined . " Why can this subcommittee do what you say ? Others have tried ; they failed . " " Because , through you , it will be both apolitical and in no way self-seeking . " Baldwin replaced his glasses ; the magnification of his old eyes hypnotized Trevayne . " Those are the necessary factors . You 're neither Republican nor Democrat , liberal nor conservative . Both parties have tried to recruit you , and you 've refused both . You 're a contradiction in this age of nomenclature . You have nothing to gain or lose . You 'll be believed . That 's the important thing . . . . We 've become a polarized people , slotted into intransigent , conflicting positions . We desperately need to believe once again in objective truth .

" Trevayne did n't ask these last questions , he made statements which , nevertheless , anticipated answers .  | " Total . That I'II guarantee . That I can promise you . " " I do n't want the job .

" STEVEN TREVAYNE looked at the expressionless mannequins clad in tweed jackets and varying shades of gray flannel slacks . The subdued lighting of the College Shoppe was appropriate for the quietly wealthy image sought after by the residents of Greenwich , Connecticut . Steven looked down at his own Levi 's , soiled sneakers , and then noticed that one of the buttons on his old corduroy jacket was about to fall off . He consulted his watch and was annoyed . It was nearly nine . He 'd told his sister that he 'd drive her and her friends back to Barnegat , but he 'd stipulated that they were to meet him by eight-thirty . He had to pick up his date over on Cos Cob by nine-fifteen . He was going to be late .

His father said no car while he was a freshman .  | Young Trevayne laughed to himself . His father was right . There was no earthly reason why he should have a car . He did n't want to travel first class ; not that way . He was about to cross the street to the drugstore and telephone his date when a police car pulled up to the curb in front of him .

" The young man pulled open the back door of the car and got in quickly . " Was there an accident ? Is she all right ? " " It 's always an accident , is n't it ? " said the policeman who was driving . Steven Trevayne gripped the back of the front seat . He was frightened now . " Please , tell me what happened !

Those kids do n't know what uncut horse is , much less how or where to sell it ! " " Do you ? " asked Detective Fowler impersonally . " I 'm not the issue , cop ! " " I 'll tell you once more , Steve , get hold of yourself or shut up ! " " No , I wo n't ! ... I 'm sorry , Dad , but I wo n't ! These jokers got a phone tip to check out the Swansons ' . No name , no reason . They ... " " Just a second , young man ! " broke in the police officer . " We 're not jokers ' and I would advise you not to use that kind of language ! " " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Fowler can explain what happened . What was this phone call , Mr. Fowler ? You did n't mention it when we spoke . " " Dad ! He wo n't tell you ! " " I do n't know ! . . . That 's the truth , Mr. Trevayne . At seven-ten this evening the desk got a phone call that there was some grass at the Swanson 's ; that we should look into it because there was a lot more involved . The caller was male , spoke with kind of a . . . well , hightoned speech . Your daughter was the only one mentioned by name . We followed it up . . . . Four kids . They admitted sharing a single  | cigarette between them during the last hour or so . It was no party . Frankly , the patrolman suggested we forget it . But by the time they radioed in their report , we 'd gotten another call . Same voice . Same person . This time we were told to look in the milk box on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heroin . Uncut ; we figure two hundred , two hundred and fifty thousand . That 's a lot of involvement . " " It 's also the most transparent , trumped-up incrimination I 've ever heard of . It 's completely unbelievable . " Trevayne looked at his watch . " My attorney should be here within a half-hour ; I 'm sure he 'll tell you the same thing . Now , I 'll stay and wait , but I know my wife would like to go out to the Swansons ' . Is that all right with you ? " The detective signed audibly . " It 's fine . " " Do you need my son any longer ? May he drive her ? " " Sure . " " Can we take her home ? " asked Phyllis Trevayne anxiously . " Take all of them back to our house ? " " Well , there are certain formalities . .. " " Never mind , Phyl . Go on out to the Swansons ' . We 'll call you as soon as Walter gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad , should n't I stay ? I can tell Walter ... " " I want you to go with your mother . The keys are in the car . Now , go on . " Trevayne and Detective Fowler watched the two of them leave . When the door was shut , Trevayne reached into his pocket for a pack of cigarettes . He offered one to the police officer , who refused . " No , thanks . I eat pistachio nuts instead these days . " " Good for you . Now , do you want to tell me what this is all about ? You do n't believe there 's any connection between that heroin and those girls any more than I do . " " Why do n't I ? It 's a very expensive connection . " " Because if you did , you 'd have them down here and booked . Precisely because it is expensive . You 're handling the entire situation in a very unorthodox manner . " " Yes , I am . " Fowler walked around his desk and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe there 's a connection . On the other hand , I ca n't dismiss it . Circumstantially , it 's explosive ; I do n't have to tell you that . " " What are you going to do ? " " This 'll surprise you , but I may be guided by your attorney . " " Which reinforces my statement . "  | " Yes , it does . I do n't think we 're on opposite sides , but I 've got problems . We 've got the evidence ; I certainly ca n't ignore it . On the other hand , the manner of our getting it raises questions . I ca n't legally hang it on the kids  --  not considering everything ... " " I 'd have you in court on false arrest . That could be expensive . " " Oh , come on , Mr. Trevayne . Do n't threaten . Legally , those girls , including your daughter , admitted using marijuana . That 's against the law . But it 's minor , and we would n't press it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want that kind of publicity ; and a quarter of a million dollars ' worth of uncut heroin is a lot of publicity . We do n't want a Darien here . " Trevayne saw that Fowler was sincere . It was a problem . It was also insane . Why would anyone want to incriminate four young girls to the extent of throwing away such an enormous sum of money ? It was an extraordinary gesture . Phyllis Trevayne came down the stairs and walked into the living room . Her husband stood in front of the huge glass wall looking out over the sound . It was long after midnight , and the moon was an August moon , shining brightly on the water . " The girls are in the adjoining guest rooms . They 'll be talking till dawn ; they 're scared out of their wits . Can I get you a drink ? " " That 'd be nice . We both could use one . " Phyllis crossed to the small built-in bar to the left of the window . " What 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Fowler will release the finding of the packages and the fact that they were uncovered as a result of telephone tips . He 's forced to do that . But he wo n't mention any names or locations on the grounds that an investigation is under way . If he 's pressed , he 'll say that he has no right incriminating innocent people . The girls ca n't tell him anything . " " Did you talk to the Swansons ? " " Yes . They panicked ; Walter calmed them down . I told them Jean would stay with us and join them tomorrow or the day after . The others are heading home in the morning . " Phyllis handed her husband a drink . " Does it make any sense to you ? At all ? " " No , it does n't . We ca n't figure it out . The voice on the phone was moneyed , according to Fowler and the desk sergeant . That could mean any of thousands ; narrowed somewhat because he knew the Swansons ' guest house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest  | home " ; he did n't describe it as a separate building or anything like that " " But why ? " " I do n't know . Maybe someone has it in for the Swansons ; really in for them , a quarter of a million dollars ' worth . Or ... " " But , Andy , " Phyllis interrupted , remembering and choosing her words carefully . " The man who called used Pam 's name . Not Jean Swanson 's . " " Sure . But the heroin was left on the Swansons ' property . " " 1 sec . " " Well , I do n't , " said Trevayne , raising his glass to his lips . " It 's all guesswork . Walter 's probably right . Whoever it was was probably caught in the middle of two transactions and panicked . The girls came along ; on the surface , rich , spoiled , easy scapegoats for an alibi . " " I ca n't think like that . " " I ca n't either , really . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard in the circular driveway in front of the house . " It must be Steve , " said Phyllis . " I told him not to be too late . " " Which he is , " added Trevayne , looking at the mantel clock . " Rut no lectures , I promise . I liked the way he behaved himself tonight . His language left something to be desired , but he was n't intimidated . He might have been . " " I was proud of him . He was his father 's son . " " No , he was just calling it as he saw it . I think the word is ' bummer . ' " The front door opened , and Steven Trevayne walked in , closing it slowly , firmly behind him . He seemed disturbed . Phyllis Trevayne started toward her son . " Wait a minute , Mom . Before you come near me , I want to tell you something . . . . I left the Swansons ' around ten-forty-five . The cop took me downtown for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we both went to the Cos Cob Tavern . We got there about eleven-thirty . I had three bottles of beer , no grass , nothing else . " " Why are you telling us this ? " asked Phyllis . The tall boy stammered , unsure of himself . " We left the place about an hour ago and went out to the car . The front seat was a mess ; someone had poured whiskey or wine or something all over it ; the seat covers were ripped , ashtrays emptied . We figured it was a lousy joke , a really lousy joke . . . . I dropped off Ginny and started for home . When I got near the townline intersection , I was stopped by a  | police car . I was n't speeding or anything ; no one chased me . ' I his patrol car just ( lagged me down at the side of the road . I thought maybe he was stuck , I did n't know . ... The cop came over and asked me for my license and registration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out . I tried to explain , but he was n't buying any of it . " " Was he from the Greenwich police ? " " I do n't know , Dad . I do n't think so ; I was still in Cos Cob . " " Go on . " " He searched me ; his partner went over the car like it was the French Connection . I thought they were going to haul me in . I sort of hoped they would ; I was sober and everything . But they did n't . They did something else . They took a Polaroid shot of me with my arms against the car  --  they made me stretch out so they could search my pockets  --  and then the first cop asked me where I 'd come from . I told him , and he went to his patrol car and called someone . He came back and asked me if I 'd hit an old man on the road about ten miles back . I said of course not . Then he tells me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What hospital ? What name ? " " He did n't say . " " Did n't you ask ? " " No , Dad ! I was scared to death . I did n't hit anyone . I never even saw anyone walking on the road . Just a couple of cars . " " Oh , my God ! " Phyllis Trevayne looked at her husband . " What happened then ? " " The other policeman took more pictures of the car and a close-up shot of my face . I can still see the flashbulb . . . . Christ , I was scared . . . . Then , just like that , they told me I could go . " The boy remained in the hallway , his shoulders slumped , the frightened bewilderment obvious in his eyes . " You 've told me everything ? " asked Trevayne . " Yes , sir , " replied the son , his fear clouding his nearly inaudible voice . Andrew walked to the end table by the couch and picked up the telephone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cos Cob Police Department . Phyllis went to her son and led him into the living room . " My name is Trevayne , Andrew Trevayne . I understand one of your patrol cars stopped my son on . . . where , Steve ? " " Junction Road , at the intersection . About a quarter of a mile from the railroad station . "  | " . . . Junction Road , near the . station at the intersection ; no more than a half-hour ago . Would you mind telling me what the report says ? Yes , I'II hold . " Andrew looked at his son , sitting in a chair , Phyllis standing beside him . The boy shivered and took several deep breaths . He watched his father , afraid , not understanding . " Yes , " said Trevayne impatiently into the telephone . " Junction Road , Cos Cob side . . . . Of course I 'm sure . My son is right here ! .. . Yes . Yes . . . . No , I 'm not positive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the boy . " On the police car ; did you see the Cos Cob name ? " " I ... I did n't actually look . It was off on the side . No , I did n't see it . " " No , he did n't , but it would have to be yours , would n't it ? He was in Cos Cob . . . . Oh ? . . . I see . You could n't check it out for me , could you ? He was stopped in your township , after all . . . . Oh ? All right , I understand . I do n't like it , but I see what you mean . Thanks . " Trevayne replaced the telephone and took a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket . " What is it , Dad ? Was n't it them ? " " No . They have two patrol cars , and neither one has been near Junction Road for the past two hours . " " What did n't you like ' but understand ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cars of the other towns . Not without a formal request , which has to be recorded in the violations file . They do n't like to do that ; they have arrangements . In case police cars cross municipal lines going after someone , they just haul them back informally . " " But you 've got to find out ! They took photographs , they said Steve hit someone ! " " I know . I will . . . . Steve , go on up and take a shower . You smell like an Eighth Avenue bar . And relax . You did n't do anything wrong . " Trevayne moved the telephone to the coffee table and sat down . Westport , Darien . Wilton . New Canaan . Southport . Nothing . " Dad , I did n't dream it up ! " Steven Trevayne shouted ; he was in his bathrobe . " I 'm sure you did n't . We 'll keep trying ; we 'll call the New York stations . " Port Chester . Rye . Harrison . White Plains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands clamped to the  | hood of an automobile soaked with alcohol , being questioned by untraceable police on a dark road about an unknown man struck down ? photographs , accusations . It made no sense ; there was an abstract quality of unbelievability . As unbelievable , as unreal as his daughter and her friends and two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ' worth of uncut heroin found in a milk box on the Swansons ' guest-house porch . Insanity . Yet it all had happened . " The girls finally fell asleep , " said Phyllis , walking into the living room . It was nearly four o'clock . " Anything ? " " No , " replied her husband . He turned to his son , who sat in a chair by the large wall window . The boy was staring outside , his fear intermittently replaced with angry bewilderment . " Try to recall , Steve . Was the patrol car some other color than black ? Perhaps dark blue or green ? " " Dark . That 's all . I suppose it could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Were there any stripes ? Any kind of insignia , no matter how vague . " " No . . . . Yes , I guess so . I just did n't look . I did n't think ... " The boy brought his hand to his forehead . " I did n't hit anyone ! I swear I did n't ! " " Of course you did n't ! " Phyllis went to him and bent down , touching her cheek to his . " It 's a terrible mistake , we know that . " " On top of a terrible joke , " added Trevayne , puzzled . The telephone on the coffee table rang . Its effect was frightening , a jarring intrusion on private fears . Trevayne swiftly picked it up . " Hello ! . . . Yes , yes . This is his residence ; I 'm his father . " Steven Trevayne leaped out of the chair and walked rapidly to the back of the couch . Phyllis remained by the window , afraid of the immediate moment . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York ! The boy 's a minor , the car 's in my name ! I should have been called immediately ! I 'd like an explanation , please . " For the next several minutes Trevayne listened without comment . When finally he spoke , it was five words . " Thank you . I 'll expect them . " He hung up the telephone and turned to his wife and son . " Andy ? Is everything all right ? " " Yes . . . . The Highport Police Station ; it 's a small village about  | fifteen miles north of ( ' os Cob . Their patrol car was following an automobile down ( ' oast Road , a robbery suspect they were checking over their radio before an arrest . They lost him and swung west Briarcliff Avenue , when they saw a man ran down by a car that I like yours , Steve . They radioed for an ambulance , informed Cos Col ) police , and after everything was taken care of , started back for Highport . They spotted you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with you a mile down the road by the intersection .... They could have let you go the minute they checked with Cob ; the hit-and-run had turned himself in . But they smelled the and thought they 'd give you a scare . . . . They 're sending us the photographs . " The terrible night was over . Steven Trevayne lay on his bed looking up at the ceiling ; the radio was tuned to one of those endless all-night talk shows where everyone shouted over everyone else . The boy thought the cacophony might help him sleep . But sleep would not come . Ile knew he should have said something ; it was stupid not to say anvthing . But the words would n't come , any more than sleep came now . The relief had been so total , so complete , so needed ; he had n't dared resurrect a doubt . His father had first mentioned the words , unknowingly . Try to recall , Steve . Was the patrol car some other color than black . . Maybe . Maybe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . That 's what he should have remembered when his father said " Highport . " Highport-on-the-Ocean was the name on the sign on Coast Road . Highport was a small village ; tiny , actually . It had two or three great beaches  --  off by themselves , and privately owned . During hot summer nights he and a few friends  --  never more than a few  --  often parked a couple of hundred yards down Coast Road and crept through the private property to reach one of the beaches . But they had to be careful ; they always had to keep an eye out for the Yellowbird . That 's what they called it . The Yellowbird . The village of Highport-on-the-Ocean 's single patrol car . It was bright yellow .  | ANDREW TREVAYNE boarded the 707 jet at John F. Kennedy Airport for the hour 's flight to Washington . He unlatched the seat belt once the aircraft completed its ascent and the warning lights were extinguished . It was three-fifteen , and he 'd be late for his meeting with Presidential Assistant Robert Webster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the White House ; say he was detained and that if because of the delay Webster wished to change the meeting place , he should leave instructions for him at Dulles Airport . It did n't matter to Trevayne ; he 'd accepted the fact that he 'd have to stay overnight . He reached for the vodka martini from the pretty young stewardess and took a long sip . Placing the glass on the small tray in front of him , Trevayne latched the seat halfway back and spread a hastily purchased New York magazine on his lap . Suddenly he was aware that the passenger next to him was staring at him . He returned the man 's look and immediately realized he knew the face . The man was large , his head enormous , his complexion deeply tanned  --  more from birth than from the sun . He was , perhaps , in his early fifties , and wore thick horn-rimmed glasses . The man spoke first . " Mr. Trevayne , is n't it ? " The voice was soft but deep , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however . " That 's right . I know we 've met , but forgive me , I do n't remember ... " " De Spadante . Mario de Spadante . " " Of course , " said Trevayne , his memory instantly activated . Mario de Spadante went back to the New Haven days , the latter part , at any rate , about nine years ago . De Spadante had represented a  | construction firm involved with some buildings Trevayne and his brother-in law were financing . Trevayne had rejected the bid  --  the builders had an insufficient history . But Mario de Spadante had gone a long way since those days a brief nine years ago . That is , if the newspapers were to be believed . He was reputed to be a power in the underworld now . " Mario the Spade " was the name often used ? referring to his swarthy complexion and the fact that he had buried a number of enemies . He was never convicted of the latter , however . " Must he nine , ten years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantly . " You remember ? You turned me down on a construction lob . And you were absolutely correct , Mr. Trevayne . Our company did n't have the experience for it . Yes , you were right . " " At best , it 's always an educated guess . Glad you do n't resent " Of course not . Never did , to tell you the truth . " De Spadante 1 ill ; at Trevayne and laughed quietly . " It was n't my company . Belonged to a cousin . . . . Him I resented , not you . He made me do his work . But everything always equals out . I learned the business , Ills business , better than he did . It 's my company now . . . . Look , I interrupted your reading . Me , I got to go over some reports  --  a bunch of long-winded , eight-cylinder paragraphs with figures way beyond any math I ever took at New Haven High . If I get stuck on a word , I 'm going to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning me down ten years ago . How about it ? " De Spadante grinned . Trevayne laughed , taking his martini off the miniature shelf . He raised the glass an inch or two toward De Spadante . " It 's the least I can do . " And he did . About fifteen minutes before landing at Dulles , Mario de Spadante asked him to clarify a particularly complex paragraph . It was so complicated that Trevayne read it several times before advising Dc Spadante to have it simplified , put in cleaner form before accepting it . " I really ca n't make much more sense out of this than to tell you they expect you to figure the large items first before tackling the smaller ones . " " So what else is new ? I use a square-foot unit plus profit , which includes the whole thing . " " I think that 's what this means . I gather you 're a subcontractor . " " That 's right . " " That general contractor wants it done in stages . At least , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I build him half a door , or maybe just the frame , and he buys the rest from somebody else ? " " I 'm probably wrong . You 'd better get it clarified . " " Maybe I wo n't . Cost him double with that kind of bidding . Nobody wants to do half of somebody else 's job . . . . You just made up for ten years ago . I 'll buy you a drink . " De Spadante took the papers from Trevayne and signaled the stewardess . He placed the papers in a large manila envelope and ordered drinks for Trevayne and himself . As Trevayne lit a cigarette , he felt the plane gradually descend . De Spadante was looking out the window , and Trevayne noticed the printing  --  upside down  --  on the large manila envelope on De Spadante 's lap . It read : Department of the Army Corps of Engineers Trevayne smiled to himself . No wonder the language was so obscure . The Pentagon engineers were the most exasperating men in Washington when it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reservation desk consisted of Robert Webster 's name and a Washington telephone number . When Trevayne called , he was surprised to learn that it was Webster 's private line at the White House . It was only a little after four-thirty ; he could have telephoned the switchboard . In Trevayne 's government days presidential aides never gave out their private numbers . " I was n't sure when you 'd get in ; the stack-ups can be terrible , " was Webster 's explanation . Trevayne was confused . It was a minor point , not worth mentioning , really , but Trevayne was bothered . The White House switchboard did n't have hours . Webster suggested they meet after dinner in the cocktail lounge of Trevayne 's hotel . " It 'll give us a chance to go over a few things before tomorrow . The President wants to chat briefly with you around ten or ten-thirty in the morning . I 'll have his firm schedule in an hour or so . " Trevayne left the telephone booth and walked toward the main exit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt , shorts , and socks ; he would have to ascertain the swiftness of the hotel 's cleaning and pressing facilities if he was going to have a White House  | audience . I le wondered why the President wished to see him . It seemed a little premature , the formalities of his acceptance not having been completed . It was possible that the President simply wished to reaffirm personally Franklyn Baldwin 's statement that the highest office in the Sunnily was behind the proposed subcommittee . If so , it was generous and meaningful . " I ley , Mr. Trevayne ! " It was Mario de Spadante standing by the curb " Can I give you a lift into town ? " " Oh , 1 do n't want to inconvenience you . I 'll grab a cab . " " No inconvenience . My car just got here . " De Spadante gestured a long , dark-blue Cadillac parked several yards to the right . " ' I hanks , I appreciate it . " 1 ) c Spadante 's chauffeur opened the back door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you staying ? " " The Milton . " " Fine . Just down the street . I 'm at the Sheraton . " Trevaync saw that the interior of the Cadillac was appointed with a telephone , miniature bar , television set , and a back-seat stereo casMIle machine . Mario de Spadante had , indeed , come a long way since Ow New I Iaven days . " Quite a car . " " You press buttons and dancing girls come out of the dashboard . Frank Is ' , it 's too ostentatious for my taste . I called it my car , but it 's not It belongs to a cousin . " " You have a lot of cousins . " " Big family .... Do n't misunderstand the term . I 'm a construction boy from New Haven who made good . " De Spadante laughed his soft , infectious laugh . " Family ! What they print about me ! Holy ( lit rst ! They should be writing movies . I do n't say there 's no mafiosi ; I 'm not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell over him . " " Hwy have to sell papers . " It was the only thing Trevayne could think of saying . " Yeah , sure . You know , I got a younger brother , about your age . Even him . He comes up to me and says What about it , Mario ? Is it true ? ' ... What about what ? ' I ask . You know me , Augie . You know me forty-two years . I got it so easy ? I do n't have to spend ten hours a day cutting costs , fighting the unions , trying to get paid on time ? ' . . . Hah ! If I was what they say , I 'd pick up a phone and scare the he-jesus out of them . As it is , I go to the banks with my tail between my guinea ass and plead . " " You look like you 're surviving . "  | Mario de Spadante laughed once more and winked his innocent , conspiratorial wink , as he had done on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive . It 's not easy , but with the grace of God and a lot of hard work , I manage . . . . Your foundation got business in Washington ? " " No . I 'm here on another matter , just meeting some people . " " That 's Washington . Greatest little meeting place in the Western Hemisphere . And you know something ? Whenever anyone says he 's just meeting people , ' that 's the sign not to ask who he 's meeting . " Andrew Trevayne just smiled . " You still live in Connecticut ? " asked De Spadante . " Yes . Outside of Greenwich . " " Nice territory . I 'm doing some residential work down there . Near the sound . " " I 'm on the sound . South shore . " " Maybe we 'll get together sometime . Maybe I can sell you a wing on your house . " " You can try . " Trevayne walked through the arch into the lounge and looked around at the various people seated in the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tuxedo , approached . " May I help you , sir ? " " Yes . I 'm to meet a Mr. Webster here . I do n't know if he made a reservation . " " Oh , yes . You 're Mr. Trevayne . " " That 's right . " " Mr. Webster telephoned that he 'd be a few minutes late . I 'll show you to a table . " " Thank you . " The tuxedoed waiter led Trevayne to a far corner of the lounge that was conspicious by its lack of customers . It seemed as if this particular location was roped by an invisible cordon to isolate it . Webster had requested such a table , and his position guaranteed it . Trevayne ordered a drink and let his memory wander back to his days in the State Department . They had been challenging , exciting , almost as stimulating as the early years with the companies . Primarily because few people believed he could accomplish the major assignment given him . It had been to coordinate trade agreements with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each country the most favor- . Ale conditions possible  --  without upsetting political balances . It had n't been difficult . Ile remembered that at the very first conference he had disarmed both sides by suggesting that the U.S. State Department and its Communist counterpart hold an international press conference in Ode room categorically rejecting everything the other side stood for , While in the next room the businessmen negotiated their agreements . The ploy had its effect ; the laughter had been sincere , and the but set for future meetings . Whenever the negotiations got heated , Someone would playfully suggest that his adversary belonged in that " other room " ? with the propagandists . I le had enjoyed his Washington days . There had been the exhilaration of knowing he was close to corridors of real power , that his judgments were listened to by men of great commitments . And they were linen of commitment , regardless of their individual political affiliations . " Mr. Trevayne ? " " Mr. Webster ? " Trevayne stood up and shook the hand of the presidential assistant . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year or two younger , a pleasant-looking man . " Sorry as hell to be late . There was a flap over tomorrow 's Schedule . The President told the four of us to lock ourselves in a room and not come out till we got it in order . " " I gather that was accomplished . " Trevayne sat down as Webster did the same . " Damned if I know . " Webster laughed , flagging a waiter . " I got you cleared for eleven-fifteen and let the rest of them figure out the afternoon . " He gave his order and collapsed back into the chair , sighing audibly . " What 's a nice Ohio farmboy like me doing in a job like this ? " " I 'd say it was a quite a leap . " " It was . I think they got the names mixed up . My wife keeps telling me there 's a guy named Webster wandering around the streets of Akron wondering why he spent all that money for campaign contributions . " " It 's possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment was no mistake . He had been a bright young man who hurl risen rapidly in Ohio State House politics , credited with keeping the governorship in the President 's column . Franklyn Baldwin had told Trevayne that Webster was a man to watch . " Did you have a good flight ? " " Yes , thanks . Much smoother than your afternoon , I think . " " I 'm sure of that . " The waiter returned with Webster 's drink ; the  | two men remained silent until he left . " Have you talked with anyone but Baldwin ? " " No , I have n't . Frank suggested that I do n't . " " The Danforth people have no idea ? " " There was n't any point . Even if Frank had n't cautioned me , nothing 's definite yet . " " It is as far as we 're concerned . The President 's delighted . He 'll tell you that himself . " " There 's still the Senate hearing . They may have different ideas . " " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing they might spring on you is your favorable press in Soviet publications . " " My what ? " " They like you over at Tass . " " I was n't aware of it . " " It does n't matter . They like Henry Ford , too . And you were doing a job for State . " " I have no intention of defending myself against something like that . " " I said it does n't matter . " " I would hope not . . . . However , there is something else , from my point of view . I 've got to have certain . . . well , I guess you 'd call them understandings . They 've got to be clear . " " What do you mean ? " " Basically , two things . I mentioned them to Baldwin . Cooperation , and no interference . Both are equally important to me . I ca n't do the job without them .

You 'll get it .. . . Unless you 've managed to fool everyone , your dossier 's a study in respectability ; they 'd let you carry around the little black box . " " No , thanks . It can stay right where it is . " " It will . . . . Now , I wanted to brief you on tomorrow . "  | Robert Webster spelled out the routine for a White House audience , and Trevayne realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival time half an hour to forty-five minutes before admittance to the Oval Room ; the specific entrance to be used ; the pass Supplied by Webster ; the suggestion that Trevayne carry no metallic Objets larger than a key ring ; the realization that the meeting was restricted to just so many minutes and might well be cut short  --  if the Chief Executivc had said what he wanted to say or heard what he Wanted to hear . If time could be saved , it should be . I revayne nodded his understanding and approval . I heir business nearly finished , Webster ordered a second and anal drink . " I promised you on the phone a couple of explanations ; I 'm flattered you have n't pressed me for them . " " They were n't important , and I assumed the President would Gilmer the one uppermost in my mind . " " ' That being . . . why he wants to see you tomorrow ? " " Yes . " " It 's all related . It 's why you have my private number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be able to reach me anytime of day or night , no matter where I am , here or overseas . " " Is that necessary ? " " I 'm not sure . But it 's the way the President wants it . I 'm not going to argue . " " Neither am I. " " The President naturally wants to convey his support for the subcommittee , and his personal endorsement of you . That 's primary . And there 's another aspect  --  I 'll put it in my words , not his ; if I make a mistake , it 's my mistake , not his . " Trevayne watched Webster carefully . " But you 've discussed what you 're about to tell me , so the variation would be minor . " " Naturally . Do n't look so concerned ; it 's for your benefit .... The President has been through the political wars , Trevayne . He 's a savvy old duck . The State machine , the House , the Senate  --  he 's been where the action is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's made a lot of friends and I 'm sure that slate is balanced by an equal number of enemies . Of course , his office removes him from those battles now , but it also allows him certain latitudes , certain pressure points . He wants you to know they 're at your disposal . " " I appreciate it . " " But there 's a catch . You 're never to try to reach him by yourself . I 'm your sole contact , your only bridge to him . " " It would never occur to me to try to reach him personally . "  | " And I 'm sure it never occurred to you that the official weight of the presidency was behind you in the most practical way . Namely , at the moment you may need it .

He wanted no room for doubt . " I understand . " " Good . If he brings it up tomorrow , just tell him we 've discussed everything . Even if he does n't you might volunteer that you 're aware of his offer ; you 're grateful , or however you want to put it . " Webster finished his drink and stood up . " Wow ! It 's not even ten-thirty yet . I 'll be home before eleven ; my wife wo n't believe it . See you tomorrow . " Webster reached down to shake Trevayne 's hand . " Fine . Good night . " Trevayne watched the younger man dodge between the armchairs , making his way rapidly toward the arch . Webster was filled with that particular energy which was at once the fuel he needed and the sustenance he took from his work . The exhilaration syndrome , Trevayne reflected . This was the town for it ; it was never really the same anywhere else . There were semblances of it in the arts , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those fields ? there was always an underlying sense of fear . Not in Washington . You were either in or out . If you were in , you were on top . If you were at the White House , you were standing on the summit . The electorate got a lot of talent for the money it paid , Trevayne had long ago decided . All in exchange for the syndrome . He looked at his watch ; it was too early to try to sleep , and he did n't feel like reading . He 'd go up to his room and call Phyllis and then look at the newspaper . Perhaps there was a movie on television . He signed the check and started out , feeling his coat pocket to make sure the room key was there . He walked through the arch and turned left toward the bank of elevators . As he passed the newsstand he saw two men in neat , pressed suits watching him from the counter . They started toward him , and when he stopped in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right spoke , while taking a small black identification case from his pocket . The other man also removed his identification . " Mr.Trevayne ? " " Yes ? "  | " Secret Service , White House detail , " said the agent softly . " May we speak with you over here , sir ? " He indicated an area away from the elevators . " Of course . " The second man held his case forward . " Would you mind confirming , Mr. Trevayne ? I 'm going outside for a minute . " I revaync checked the photograph against the man 's face . It was authentic , and he nodded . The agent turned and walked away . " What is this ? " " I 'd like to wait until my partner returns , sir . He 'll make sure everything 's clear . Would you care for a cigarette ? " No , thank you . But I would like to know what this is all about . " " The President would like to see you tonight . " Mr Brown Secret Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two agents rushed Trevayne down the steps while the driver held the rear door open . They sped off down the street , turning south on Nebraska Avenue . " We 're not going to the White House , Mr. Trevayne . The President 's in Georgetown . His schedule is such that it 's more convenient this way . " After several minutes the car bounced along the narrow cobblestone streets that marked the residential area . Trevayne saw that they were heading east toward the section with the large , five-story townhouses , rebuilt remnants of a gracious era . They drove up in front of particularly wide brownstone structure with many windows and sculptured trees on the sidewalk . The Secret Service man on the curb side got out , signaling Trevayne to do the same . There were two other plainclothesmen at the front door , and the minute they recognized their fellow agent , they nodded to each other and removed their hands from their pockets . The man who first had spoken to Trevayne in the hotel led him  | inside through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor . They entered ; the agent pulled the brass grille shut and pushed the automatic button : four . " Close quarters in here , " said Trevayne . " The Ambassador says his grandchildren play in it for hours when they visit . I think it 's really a kiddie elevator . " " The Ambassador ? " " Ambassador Hill . William Hill . This is his house . " Trevayne pictured the man . William Hill was in his seventies now . A wealthy eastern industrialist , friend-to-Presidents , roving diplomat , war hero . " Big Billy Hill " was the irreverent nickname given by Time magazine to the articulate , soft-spoken gentleman . The elevator stopped , and the two men got out . There was another hallway and another plainclothesman in front of another door . As Trevayne and the agent approached him , the man unobtrusively withdrew a small object from his pocket , slightly larger than a pack of cigarettes , and made several crisscross motions in Trevayne 's direction . " Like being given a benediction , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What is it ? " " A scanner . Routine , do n't be insulted . Come on . " The man with the tiny machine opened the door for them . The room beyond the door was an immense library-study . The bookcases were floor-to-ceiling , the Oriental carpets thick , the furniture heavy wood and masculine . The lighting was indirect from a halfdozen lamps . There were several leather armchairs and a large mahogany table which served as the desk . Behind the table sat Ambassador William Hill . In an armchair to the right sat the President of the United States . " Mr. President . Mr. Ambassador . . . . Mr. Trevayne . " The Secret Service man turned and walked out , closing the door behind him . Hill and the President rose as Trevayne approached the latter , gripping the hand extended to him . " Mr. President . " " Mr. Trevayne , good of you to come . I hope I did n't inconvenience you . " " Not at all , sir . " " You know Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A pleasure , sir . " " I doubt it , at this hour , " William Hill laughed , coming around the table . " Let me get you a drink , Trevayne . Nothing in the Constitu- Lion says you have to be abstemious during any meeting called after six o'clock . " " I was n't aware that there were any strictures before six , either , " said the President . " Oh , I 'm sure there are some eighteenth-century phrases which might apply . What 'll you have , Trevayne ? " asked the old gentleman . Trevayne told him , realizing that the two men were trying to put him at ease . The President gestured for him to sit down and Hill brought him his glass . " We met once before , but I do n't suppose you recall , Mr. Trevayne , " " Of course , I do , Mr. President . It was four years ago , I think . " " That 's right . I was in the Senate , and you had done a remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the trade conference . Did you know that the then-Secretary of State was very annoyed with you ? " " I heard rumors . He never said anything to me , though . " " How could he ? " interjected Hill . " You got the job done . He 'd boxed himself into a corner . " " That 's what made it so amusing , " added the President . " At the time , it seemed the only way to thaw the freeze , " said Trevayne . " Excellent work . Excellent . " The President leaned forward in the armchair , looking at Trevayne . " I meant what I said about inconveniencing you this evening . I know we 'll meet again in the morning , but I felt tonight was important . I wo n't waste words ; I 'm sure you 'd like to get back to your hotel . " " No hurry , sir . " " That 's kind of you . " The Chief Executive smiled . " I know you met with Bobby Webster . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think I understand everything ; I appreciate your offer of assistance . " " You 're going to need it . We were n't sure we were going to ask you to come out here tonight . It depended on Webster . . . . The minute he left you he telephoned me here . On my instructions . Then we knew we had to get you over . " " Oh ? Why was that ? " " You told Webster that you 'd spoken with no one but Frank l3aldwin about the subcommittee . Is that correct ? " " Yes , sir . Frank indicated that I should n't . At any rate , there was no reason to talk to anyone about it ; nothing was set . "  | The President of the United States looked over at William Hill , who stared intently at Trevayne . Hill returned the Chief Executive 's look , then pulled his attention back to Trevayne . Hill spoke softly , but with concern . " Are you absolutely sure ? " " Of course . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said anything ? " " I did , but she would n't . I 'm positive about that . Why do you ask ? " The President spoke . " You 're aware that we sent out rumors that you were being approached for the job . " " They reached me , Mr. President . " " They were meant to . Are you also aware that the Defense Commission is composed of nine members  --  leaders in their respective fields , some of the most honored men in the country ? " " Frank Baldwin said as much . " " Did he tell you that they agreed to a man not to reveal any decisions , any progress , any concrete information ? " " No , he did n't , but I can understand it . " " Good . Now , I must tell you this . A week ago we sent out another rumor . An authenticated rumor  --  agreed to by the commission  --  that you had categorically rejected the post . We left no room for doubt as to where you stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole concept , considered it a dangerous encroachment . You even accused my administration of police-state tactics . It was the sort of suppressed information that experience tells us is most readily believed , because it 's embarrassing . " " And ? " Trevayne did not try to conceal his annoyance . Not even the President of the United States had the right to attribute such judgments to him . " Word came back to us that you had not rejected , but , instead , accepted the post . Civilian and military intelligence established the fact that in certain powerful sectors it was common knowledge . Our denial was ignored . " The President and the Ambassador remained silent , as if to let the importance of their revelation have an effect on Trevayne . The younger man looked bewildered , unsure of his reaction . " Then my refusal ' was n't believed . That does n't surprise me . Those who know me probably doubted it  --  the way it was phrased , at any rate . " " Even when personally confirmed to selected visitors by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Not simply me , Mr. Trevayne . The office of the President of the United States . Whoever that man is , he 's a tall fellow to call a liar . Especially in an area like this . " Trevayne looked over at both men . He was beginning to understand , but the picture was still out of focus . " Is it . . . was it necessary to create the confusion ? Does it matter whether I take the job , or someone else ? " " Apparently it does , Mr. Trevayne , " answered Hill . " We know the proposed subcommittee is being watched ; that 's understandable . But we were n't sure of the intensity . We surfaced your name and then proceeded to deny  --  vehemently deny  --  your acceptance . It should have been enough to send the curious out speculating on other nominees . It was n't . They were sufficiently concerned to dig further , dig until they learned the truth . " " What the Ambassador means  --  forgive me , Bill  --  is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarming to tai litany people that they went to extraordinary lengths to ascertain your status . They had to make sure you were out . They discovered otherwise , and rapidly spread the word . Obviously in preparation . " " Mr. President , I assume this subcommittee , if it functions properly , will touch a great many people . Of course , it 'll be watched . I expected that . " William Hill leaned forward over his desk . " Watched ? . . . What we 've described goes far beyond the meaning of the word watched ' as I understand it . You may be assured that large sums of money have been exchanged , old debts called in , a number of dangerous embarrassments threatened . These things had to happen , or a different conclusion would have been arrived at . " " Our purpose , " said the President , " is to make you aware , to alert you . This is a frightened city , Mr. Trevayne . It 's frightened of vim. , , Andrew slowly put down his glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you suggesting , Mr. President , that I reconsider the ap-pointment ? " " Not for a minute . And if Frank Baldwin knows what he 's talking about , you 're not the sort of man who 'd be affected by this kind of thing . But you have to understand . This is n't an interim government appointment made to a respected member of the business community r the sake of mollifying a few outraged voices . We are committed ? um committed to see it produce results . It must follow that there will he a considerable degree of ugliness . " " I think I'in prepared for that . "  | " Are you ? " asked Hill , leaning back once again in his chair . " That 's very important , Mr. Trevaync . " " I believe so . I 've thought it over , talked it out at length with my wife . . . my very discreet wife . I have no illusions that it 's a popular assignment . " " Good . It 's necessary you understand that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a file folder from the large maroon blotter on his table-desk . It was inordinately thick , bulky , and held together by wide metal hasps . " May we dwell for a minute on something else ? " " Of course . " Trevayne looked at Hill as he answered , but he could feel the President 's stare . He turned , and the President instantly shifted his eyes to the Ambassador . It was an uncomfortable moment . " This is your dossier , Mr. Trevayne , " said Hill , holding the file horizontally , as if weighing it . " Damned heavy , would n't you say ? " " Compared to the few I 've seen . I ca n't imagine its being very interesting . " " Why do you say that ? " asked the President , smiling . " Oh , I do n't know . . . . My life has n't been filled with the sort of events that make for exciting fiction . " " Any man who reaches the level of wealth you did before he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One reason for the size of this file is that I kept requesting additional information . It 's a remarkable document . May I touch on a few points I found salient , several not entirely clear ? " " Certainly . " " You left Yale Law within six months of your degree . You never made any attempt to finish or pursue the bar . Yet your standing was high ; the university officials tried to convince you to stay , but to no avail . That seems odd . " " Not really . My brother-in-law and I had started our first company . In Meriden , Connecticut . There was no time for anything else . " " Was n't it also a strain on your family ? Law school ? " " I 'd been offered a full scholarship . I 'm sure that 's listed . " " I mean , in the sense of contributing . " " Oh . . . . I see what you 're driving at . I think you 're giving it more significance than it deserves , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankruptcy in nineteen fifty-two . " " The circumstances were untidy , I gather . Would it bother you to describe them ? " asked the President of the United States . Trevayne looked alternately at both men . " No , not at all . My  | fat het spent thirty years building up a medium-sized woolens factory ? a mill , actually in Hancock , Massachusetts ; it 's a town outside of Ruston . Ile made a quality product , and a New York conglomerate wanted the label . They absorbed the mill with the understandingmv father 's understanding  --  that he 'd be retained for life as the Hancock management . Instead , they took the label , closed the factory , and unwed south to the cheaper labor markets . My father tried to reopen , illegally used his old label , and went under . Hancock became a New England mill-town statistic . " " An unfortunate story . " The President 's statement was made quietly . " Your father had no recourse in the courts ? Force the company to make restitution on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no default . His understanding was predicated on an ambiguous clause . And talk . Legally , he had no grounds . " " I see , " said the President . " It must have been a terrible blow to your family . " " And to the town , " added Hill . " The statistic . " " It was an angry time . It passed . " Andrew recalled only too well the anger , the frustration . The furious , bewildered father who roared at the silent men who merely smiled and pointed to paragraphs and signatures . " Did that anger cause you to leave law school ? " asked William Hill . " The events coincided ; you had only six months to go for your degree ; you were offered financial aid . " Andy looked at the old Ambassador with grudging respect . The Brie of questioning was becoming clearer . " I imagine it was part of it . I here were other considerations . I was very young and felt there were more important priorities . " " Was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective ? " Hill spoke gently . " Why do n't you say what you want to say , Mr. Ambassador ? Are n't we both wasting the President 's time ? " The President offered no comment ; he continued to watch Trevayne , as a doctor might study a patient . " All right , I will . " Hill closed the file and tapped it lightly with his ancient fingers . " I 've had this dossier for nearly a month . I 've read it and reread it perhaps twenty times over . And as I 've told you , I repeatedly asked for additional data . At first it was merely to learn more about a successful young man named Trevayne , because Frank Baldwin was  --  and is  --  convinced that you 're the only man to chair that subcommittee . Then it became something else . We had to find out  | why , whenever your name was mentioned as a possible nominee , the reactions were so hostile . Silently hostile , 1 might add . " " Dumbstruck ' might be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agreed , " said Hill . " The answer had to be here , but I could n't find it . Then , as the material was processed  --  and I placed it in chronological order  --  I found it . But I had to go back to March of nineteen fifty-two to understand . Your first compulsive , seemingly irrational action . I 'd like to capsule ... " As Ambassador William Hill droaned on , summarizing his conclusions point by point , Andrew wondered if the old man really did understand . It was all so long ago ; yet yesterday . There had been only one priority , one objective . To make a great deal of money ; massive amounts that once and for all would eliminate the remotest possibility of ever having to experience what he witnessed his father living through in that Boston courtroom . It was n't so much a sense of outrage  --  although the outrage was there  --  as it was a feeling of waste ; the sheer waste of resources  --  financial , physical , mental : that was the fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's productivity thwarted , warped , and finally stopped by the inconvenience of sudden poverty . Fantasy became the reality ; vindication an obsession . At last the imagination lost all control , and a once proud man  --  moderately proud , moderately successful  --  was turned into a shell . Hollow , self-pitying , living through each day propelled by hatreds . A familiar , loving human being had been transformed into a grotesque stranger because he had n't the price of survival . In March of 1952 the final gavel was sounded in a Boston courtroom and Andrew Trevayne 's father was informed that he was no longer permitted to function in the community of his peers . The courts of the land had upheld the manipulators . The bestefforts , endeavors , whereases , and therebys buried forever the work of an adult lifetime . The father was rendered impotent , a bewildered eunuch appealing in strained , falsely masculine roars to the unappealable . And the son was no longer interested in the practice of law . As with most histories of material success , the factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But whenever Andrew Trevayne gave that simple explanation , few believed it . They preferred to look for deeper , more manipulative reasons . Or in his case an emotional motive , based on revulsion , that lucked in.  | Nonsense . The timing was supplied by the brother of the girl who became his wife . Phyllis Pace 's older brother . Douglas Pace was a brilliant , introverted electronics engineer who worked for Pratt and Whitney in Hartford ; a painfully shy man happiest in the isolation of his laboratory , but also a man who knew when he was right and others were wrong . The others in his case were the Pratt and Whitney executives who firmly refused to allocate funds for the development of close-tolerance spheroid discs . Douglas Pace was convinced that the spheroid disc was the single most vital component of the new high-altitude propulsion techniques . He was ahead of his time  --  - but only by about thirty-one months . Their first " factory " consisted of a small section of an unused warehouse in Meriden ; their first machine a third-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first jobs odd-lot assignments of simple jet-engine discs for the Pentagon 's general contractors , including Pratt and Whitney . Because their overhead was minuscule and their work sophisticated , they took on a growing number of military subcontracts , until second and third Bullards were installed and the entire warehouse rented . Two years later the airlines made an industry decision : the way of the jet aircraft was the way of the commercial future . Schedules were projected calling for operational passenger carriers by the late fifties , and suddenly all the knowledge acquired in the development of the military jet had to be adapted to civilian needs . And Douglas Pace 's advanced work in spheroid discs was compatible with this new approach ; compatible and far ahead of the large corporate manufacturers . Their expansion was rapid and paid for up front , their backlog of orders so extensive they could have kept ten plants working three shifts for five years . And Andrew discovered several things about himself . He had been told he was a major salesman , but it did n't take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product was so sought after . Instead , other gifts came into play . The first , perhaps , was the softscience of administration . He was n't just good ; he was superb , and he knew it . He could spot talent and place it under contract  --  at some other company 's loss  --  in a matter of hours . Gifted men believed him , wanted to believe him , and he was quick to establish the weaknesses of their current situations ; to hammer at them and offer viable alternatives . Creative and executive personnel found climates in which they could  | function , incentives which brought out their best work under his aegis . He could talk to union leadership , too . Talk in ways it readily understood . And no labor contract was ever signed without the precedent he 'd fought for in the company 's first expansion in New Haven  --  the productivity clause that locked in wages with the end result of assemblyline statistics . The wage scales were generous , outstripping competition , but never isolated from the end results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the term was simplistic , misleading . He negotiated on the theory of enlightened self-interest ; and he was totally convincing . As the months and years went by , he had a track record to point to ; it was irrefutable . The most surprising asset Andrew found within himself was completely unexpected , even inexplicable . He had the ability to retain the most complex dealings without reference to contracts or notes . He had wondered briefly if he possessed a form of total recall , but Phyllis shot down that conceit by pointing out that he rarely remembered a birthday . Her explanation was , he felt , nearer the truth . She said he never entered any negotiation without absolute commitment , exhaustive analysis . She gently implied that this pattern might be traced to his observation of his father 's experience . It all would have been enough  --  the airlines , the expansion , the production network that began to extend throughout the Atlantic seaboard . On balance , it should have appeared that they had gone as far as they could hope for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sight . For on the night of October 4 , 1957 , an announcement was made that startled mankind . Moscow had launched Sputnik I. The excitement started all over again . National and industrial priorities were about to be altered drastically . The United States of America was relegated to second status , and the pride of the earth 's most inventive constituency was wounded , its people perplexed . Restoration to primacy was demanded , the cost inconsequential . On the evening of the Sputnik news , Douglas Pace had driven out to Andy 's home in East Haven , and Phyllis kept the coffee going until four o'clock in the morning . A decision was reached that ensured the Pace-Trevayne Company 's emergence as the Space Administration 's largest independent contractor of spheroid discs capable of sustaining rocket thrusts of ultimately six hundred thousand pounds . The decision was to concentrate on space . They would maintain a bread-and-butter margin with the airlines , but retool with space objectives , anticipating  | the problems to merge with the larger aircraft surely to be demanded in the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents of Pace and Trevayne were ready .

The game that you despised because you said it made me " dirty . " It began with that filthy little bastard who dressed like a faggot tailor . It began with Allen " Your company made an audacious move , " continued Big Billy Hill . " Without guarantees , you restructured seventy percent of your factories  --  nearly all of your laboratories  --  to accommodate an uncertain market . Uncertain in the sense of its realistic demand . " " We never doubted the market ; we only underestimated the demand . " " Obviously . And you proved correct .

We counted on our preparation schedules , our timing . No one could compete with us ; we banked on that . " " But the extent of your conversions was known within the industry , was n't it ? " asked Hill . " Unavoidable . " " And the risks ? " Hill again . " To a degree . We were a privately owned company ; we did n't broadcast our financial statement . " " But it could be assumed . " Hill was centering in . " It could . " Hill removed a single sheet of paper from the top of the file , turning its face toward Andrew .

" " When questioned privately , you said you 'd been approached by outside interests who implied that their assistance might be necessary to obtain the NASA contracts . " " Yes . I was upset . We were qualified on our own . " Ambassador Hill leaned back and smiled . " This letter , then , was really a highly strategic device , was n't it ? You scared hell out of a lot of people .

You let the word out that you 'd be interested in exploratory talks of merger . One by one you held successive conferences with no less than seventeen major defense contractors over a three-year period . A number of these were written up in the newspapers .

The manipulators.  | " May I suggest , Mr. Trevayne , that you never intended to reach any firm agreements ? " " You may suggest that , Mr. Ambassador . " " And would it be inaccurate to suggest further that you gained a relatively detailed working knowledge of the financial operations of seventeen major corporations involved in defense spending ? " " Not inaccurate . I 'd stress the past tense , however . It was over a decade ago . " " A short period of time when you 're talking about corporate policy , " said the President . " I imagine that most of the executive personnel remain the same . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took several steps to the edge of the mahogany table . He looked down at Trevayne and spoke quietly , good-naturedly . " You were exorcising a few demons , were n't you ? " Andrew met the old gentleman 's eyes and could n't help himself ; he smiled slowly , with a marked degree of defeat . " Yes , I was . " " You were repaying the sort of people who destroyed your father . ... March , nineteen fifty-two . " " It was childish . A hollow kind of revenge ; they were n't responsible . " Remember , Phyl ? You told me : " Be yourself . This is n't you , Andy ! Stop it ! " " Satisfying , however , I would think . " Hill walked around the desk and leaned against the front edge between Trevayne and the President . " You forced a number of powerful men to make concessions , lose time , become defensive ; all for a young man barely in his thirties who held a large carrot in front of their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't understand is why you so abruptly stopped . If my information is correct , you were in a position of extreme strength . It 's not inconceivable that you might have emerged as one of the world 's richest men . Certainly possible that you could eventually have ruined a number of those you considered the enemy . Especially in the market . " " I suppose I could say I got religion . " " It 's happened before , I 'm told , " said the President . " Then let 's call it that . . . . It occurred to me  --  with my wife 's help  --  that I had involved myself in the same form of waste I found so appalling in . . . March of nineteen fifty-two . I was on the other side , but the waste was the same . . . . And that , Mr. President , Mr. Ambassador , is all I care to say about it . I sincerely hope it 's acceptable . "  | Trevayne smiled as best he could , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for his highball as I fill nodded and returned to his chair . " Our questions have been answered ; as the Ambassador said , we were curious , we had to know . Among other things , your state of mind  --  which , frankly , we never doubted . " " We assumed it to be healthy . " Hill laughed as he spoke . " Anyone who leaves his own company to take on a thankless State Department job and then assumes the headaches of a philanthropic foundation is no ruthless Caesar of the financial world . " " Thank you . " The President leaned forward , locking his eyes with Andrew 's . " It 's of paramount importance that this job be carried out , Mr. Trevayne ; go the distance . The specter of financial and political collusion is always ugly ; it becomes worse if it 's suspected of being covered up . In other words , once you commit yourself , that 's it . There 's no turning back . " Andrew realized that the President was giving him his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made when he 'd first heard the rumors . He knew he was the man to do it . He wanted to do it . For many reasons . Among them , the memory of a Boston courtroom . " I 'd like the post , Mr. President . I wo n't quit . " " I believe you . " PHYLLIS TREVAYNE was n't often annoyed with her husband . He was careless , but she attributed that to his extraordinary concentration on whatever project he currently undertook , not to indifference . He had little patience with the niceties , but he was a nice person , time permitting . Abrupt , but gentle in his relationships . Abrupt even with her sometimes , but always considerate . And he had been there when she needed him most . The awful years . She was annoyed with him this evening , however .  | He had told her  --  asked her , really  --  to meet him in town . In the Palm Court at the Plaza Hotel . He specifically had said seven-thirty ; there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed that out . It was eight-fifteen , and no message had arrived to explain his absence . She was hungry as hell , among other things . And besides , she had had her own plans for the evening . Both children were leaving for their respective schools within the week ; Pamela back to Miss Porter 's , Steve to Haverford . Husbands never understood the preparations ; there were as many logistic decisions to be made prior to sending children away for three months as there were in most business dealings . Probably more . She had wanted to spend the evening making a few of those decisions , not driving into New York . Besides , she had a lecture to prepare . Well , not really ; that could wait . She was going to talk to Andy about getting a chauffeur . She hated that goddamned Lincoln . She hated the idea of a chauffeur , too , but she hated the Lincoln more . And Andy would n't let her drive a smaller car into New York . When she objected , he produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , damn ! damn ! damn ! Where was he ? It was eight-twenty now . Carelessness was rapidly becoming rudeness . She 'd ordered a second vermouth-casisse and nearly finished it . It was an innocuous drink , a feminine drink , and the best to sip while waiting , because she did n't really like it . And of course it was necessary that she did n't like it . She was flattered that several men had passed her table and given her second looks . Not at all bad for forty-two  --  about to be forty-three  --  and two grown children . She must remember to tell Andy about them . He 'd laugh and say something like : What did you expect , you think I married a mongrel ? She had a good sex life , Phyllis reflected . Andy was a passionate man , an inquisitive man . They both enjoyed the bed . What had Tennessee Williams said ? Was it Williams ? Yes , it had to be . . . . Some character in an early play , a play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the bed 's okay , the marriage 's okay ! . . . Something like that . She liked Tennessee Williams . He was a poet as much as a playwright . Perhaps more of a poet . Suddenly Phyllis Trevayne felt sick , terribly sick . Her eyes lost their focus , the entire Palm Court seemed to spin around and around . And then she heard voices above her .  | " Madame , madame ! Are you ill ? Madame ! Boy ! Boy ! Get smelling salts ! " Other voices , crescendos of volume , a blurring of words . . nothing made sense , nothing was real . There was a hardness against her face , and she vaguely knew it was the marble floor of the room . Everything began to go dark , black . And then she heard the words . " I 'll take care of her ! It 's my wife ! We 've a suite upstairs ! Here , give me a hand ! It 's all right ! " But the voice was n't that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd taken from his office at Danforth had rammed into a Chevrolet sedan , and the policeman had insisted he remain on the scene until all the statements were taken . The wait was interminable . When he told the police officer he was in a hurry , the patrolman replied that if the passenger in the Chevrolet could wait , prone on his back , for an ambulance , the least Trevayne could do was wait for the statements to be taken . Twice Trevayne had gone to a corner pay phone to call his wife at the Plaza and explain , but each time he reached the bell captain to have her paged , he was told she was n't in the Palm Court . The traffic down from Connecticut was probably lousy , and she 'd be doubly upset if she arrived late and found him not there . Goddamn it ! Goddamn it ! Finally , at eight-twenty-five , he 'd given his statement to the police and was allowed to leave the scene . As he flagged down another cab , he vaguely thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plaza , the bell captain seemed to recognize his voice . Or , at least , the time span between his requesting the paging of his wife and the answer seemed much shorter than on the first call . But Trevayne knew his impatience was heightened when he was angry . Perhaps that was it . And yet , if that were so , why did n't it seem longer ? Not shorter . " Yes , sir ! Yes , sir ! The description is the same ! She sat right there ! " " Then where is she ? " " Her husband , sir ! Her husband took her upstairs to their rooms ! " " I 'm her husband , you goddamned idiot ! Now , tell me ! " Trevayne had the waiter by the throat .  | " Please , sir ! " The waiter screamed , as most of the Palm Court turned in the direction of the loud voices , heard above the punctuated strains of the violin quartet . Two Plaza house detectives pulled Trevayne 's hands away from the pleading waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs ! " Trevayne threw the arms off him and raced to the desk . When one of the detectives came up behind him , he did something he would n't have thought he was capable of doing . He slammed his fist into the man 's neck . The detective fell backward as his fellow officer withdrew a pistol . Simultaneously , the frightened clerk behind the desk spoke hysterically . " Here , sir ! Trevayne ! Mrs. A. Trevayne . Suite Five H and I ! The reservation was made this afternoon ! " Trevayne did n't think about the man behind him . He ran to the door marked " Stairs " and raced up the concrete steps . He knew the detective followed ; the shouts came at him to stop , but he refused . It was only necessary to reach a suite at the Plaza Hotel marked " Five H and I. " He pushed his full weight into the corridor door and emerged on the thin rug that bespoke of better times . The doors in front of him read " Five A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C and D. " He rounded the corner and the letters stared him in the face . " H and I. " The door was locked , and he threw himself against it . It gave only slightly under his weight . Trevayne moved back several feet and slammed the heel of his foot against the lock area . It cracked , but did not open . By now the winded , middle-aged house detective approached . " You goddamn son-of-a-bitch ! I could have shot you ! Now , get away from there or I will ! " " You will not ! My wife 's in there ! " The strident urgency of Trevayne 's command had its effect . The detective looked at the panicked husband and lent his own foot to Trevayne 's next assault . The door came off the upper left hinge , crashing down obliquely into the short foyer . Trevayne and the detective rushed into the room . The detective saw what he had to see and turned away . He 'd seen it before . He 'd wait in the doorframe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no violence . Phyllis Trevayne was naked in the white sheets of the bed ; the  | covers were at the foot , lumped as if thrown off carelessly . On the night table , on the left side , was a bottle of Drambuie , two glasses half-full . On Phyllis Trevayne 's breasts were lipstick marks . Phalluses outlined toward the nipples . The detective assumed that somebody had had a ball . He hoped to Christ the third party had left the premises . Goddamn fool if he had n't . Phyllis Trevayne sat up in the bed drinking coffee , wrapped in towels . The doctor had finished his examination and motioned to Trevayne to come into the other room . " I 'd say a very powerful sedative , Mr. Trevayne . A Mickey Finn , if you like . There wo n't be much aftereffect , perhaps a headache , upset stomach . " " Was she . . . was she assaulted ? " " Debateable , without a more thorough examination than I can perform here . If she was , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetration . . . . But I think an attempt was made , I wo n't disguise that . " " She 's not aware of the . . . attempt , is she ? " " I 'm sorry . Only she can answer that . " " Thank you , doctor . " Trevayne returned to the front room of the suite and took his wife 's hand , kneeling down beside her . " You 're a rough old lady , you know that ? " " Andy ? " Phyllis Trevayne looked at her husband calmly , but with a fear he rightfully had never seen before . " Whoever it was tried to rape me . I remember that . " " I 'm glad you do . He did n't . " " I do n't think so . . . . Why , Andy , why ? " " I do n't know , Phyl . But I 'm going to find out . " " Where were you ? " " In a traffic accident . At least , I thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are we going to do ? " " Not we , Phyl . Me . I have to reach a man in Washington . I do n't want any part of them . " " I do n't understand you . " " Neither do I , really . But I think there 's a connection . " " The President 's in Camp David , Mr. Trevayne . I 'm sorry , it would n't be convenient to reach him now . What 's the matter ? "  | Trevayne told Robert Webster what had happened to his wife . The presidential aide was speechless . " Did you hear that I said ? " " Yes .... Yes , I did . It 's horrible . " " Is that all you can say ? Do you know what the President and Hill told me last week ? " " I have a good idea . The chief and I discussed it ; I explained that . " " Is this connected ? I want to know if this is part of it ! I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I do n't think he could , either . You 're at the Plaza ? I 'll call you back in a few minutes . " Webster hung up , and Andrew Trevayne held the disconnected telephone in his grip . They could all go screw ! The Senate hearing was scheduled for two-thirty the next afternoon , and he 'd tell them all to go to hell ! Phyllis was no part of the bargain ! It was one thing to go after him ; he could handle that . Not his family . He 'd level those bastards at two-thirty tomorrow as they 'd never been leveled ! And he 'd hold a press conference afterward . He 'd let the whole goddamn country know what kind of pigs inhabited a town called Washington , D.C. ! He did n't need it ! He was Andrew Trevayne ! He replaced the telephone in its cradle and walked over to the hotel bed . Phyllis was asleep . He sat down on a chair and stroked her hair . She moved slightly , started to open her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through so much . And now this ! The telephone rang , its bell causing him to jerk his head up , frightened , furious . He ran to it . " Trevayne ! It 's the President . I 've just heard . How 's your wife ? " " Asleep , sir . " Trevayne was amazed at himself . In the midst of his anguish he still found the presence of mind to say " Sir . " " Christ , boy ! I have n't any words ! What can I say to you ? What can I do ? " " Release me , Mr. President . Because if you do n't , I 'm going to have a great deal to say tomorrow afternoon . Inside the hearing and out . " " Of course , Andrew . It goes without saying . " The President of the United States paused before speaking further . " She 's all right ? Your wife is all right ? " " Yes , sir . . . . It was a . . . terror tactic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Trevayne had to hold his breath . He was afraid of the words that might come out of his mouth .  | " Trevayne , listen to me . Andrew , listen ! You may never forgive me for what I am about to say to you . If you feel strong enough , I 'll accept the consequences and expect your roughest condemnation tomorrow . I wo n't rebut you . . . . But you must think now . With your head . I 've had to do it hundreds of times  --  granted , not like this  --  but , nevertheless , when it hurt badly . . . . The country knows you 've been chosen . The hearing is only a formality now . If you tell them to shove it up their ass , how are you going to do it without paining your wife further ? . . . Do n't you see ? This is exactly what they want ! " Trevayne took a deep breath and replied evenly . " I have no intention of paining my wife further or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't need you , Mr. President . Do I make yourself clear ? " " You certainly do . And I agree with you completely . But I have a problem . I need you . I said it would be ugly ... " Ugly ! Ugly ! That goddamn terrible word ! " Yes , ugly ! " Trevayne roared viciously into the telephone . The President continued as if Trevayne had not shouted . " I think you should think about what 's happened . . . . If it can happen to you , and by all our estimates you 're one of the better ones , think what can happen to others . . . . Are we to stop ? Is that what we should do ? " " Nobody elected me to anything ! I 'm not beholden , and you know damn well I 'm not ! I do n't want it to concern me . " " But you know it does . Do n't answer me now . Think . . . . Please , talk to your wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness . " " It wo n't do any good , Mr. President . I want out . " " Think about it . I ask you to give me a few hours . The office asks you that . Speaking as a man and not as your President , however , I must tell you that I 'm pleading . The lines are drawn now . We ca n't turn back . But as a man , I 'll understand your refusal . . . . My greatest sympathy and well-wishes to your wife . . . . Good night , Andrew . " Trevayne heard the click of the disconnection and slowly replaced the telephone . He reached into his shirt pocket for his cigarettes , and extracting one , lit it with the all-maroon matches labeled " The Plaza . " There was n't much to think about . He was n't about to change his mind for the tactics of a very persuasive President . He was Andrew Trevayne . Every once in a while he had to remind himself of that . He did n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Andy ? " ? Trevayne looked over at the bed . His wife 's head was propped sideways against the pillow , and her eyes were open .  | " Yes , darling ? " He got out of the chair and walked rapidly to the bedside . His wife was only half-conscious . " I heard . I heard what you said . " " Just do n't worry about a thing . The doctor 'll be back in the morning ; we 'll head up to Barnegat first thing . You 're fine . Sleep now . " " Andy ? " " What , sweetheart ? " " He wants you to stay , does n't he ? " " It does n't make any difference what he wants . " " He 's right . Do n't you see that ? If you quit . . . they 've beaten you . " Phyllis Trevayne shut her eyes deliberately . Andrew felt deeply for the pained expression on her exhausted face . Then he realized as he watched his wife that her pain was mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter Madison closed the door of his study and turned the brass knob , locking himself in . He 'd gotten the call from Trevayne at the restaurant , and in spite of his panic , had followed Andy 's instructions . f le 'd reached the Plaza security man and made sure no police report would be filed . Trevayne was adamant that Phyllis be spared  --  the family , the children , spared  --  any press coverage of the assault . Phyllis could n't help with descriptions of either the man or the event ; everything had been blurred for her , incoherent . The Plaza security man had read something else into Madison 's instructions  --  the explicit instructions of the powerful attorney for the more powerful Andrew Trevayne  --  and did n't bother disguising his interpretation . For several minutes Madison had considered offering the man money , but the lawyer in him prevented that ; retired police officers adding to their pensions in stylish hotels had a proclivity for stretching out such understandings . Better the man believe what he wanted to believe . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paid for . Madison sat down at his desk ; he saw that both his hands shook . Thank God his wife was asleep . Asleep or passed out , what difference ? He tried to understand , tried to put everything into perspective , into some kind of order . It had begun three weeks ago , with one of the most lucrative offers of his career . A silent retainer , conceived and executed in confidence . With him alone , unrelated to his partners or his firm . It was n't an unusual practice , although he had entered into very few such agreements . Too often they were n't worth the strain  --  or the secrecy .  | This agreement was . Seventy-five thousand dollars a year . llntaxable , untraceable . Paid out of Paris into a Zurich account . Length of contract : forty-eight months . Three hundred thousand dollars . Nor was there any attempt to hide the reasons behind the offer . Andrew Trevayne . He , Walter Madison , was Trevayne 's attorney ; he had been for over a decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Trevayne 's lawyer he was to advise his new clients of any startling or extraordinary information related to Andrew and this proposed subcommittee  --  which was n't even in existence as yet . And there was no guarantee that Andrew would advise him . That was understood . The risk was undertaken solely by the clients ; they understood that . It was entirely possible that no conflict would ever arise . Even if it did , whatever information he might transmit could be unearthed from a dozen sources . And in his bracket , it would take him a considerable length of time to bank three hundred thousand dollars . But his agreement tolerated nothing in the area of what happened that evening at the Plaza . Nothing ! To associate him with such an act was beyond imagination . He unlocked the top drawer of his desk and withdrew a small leather notebook . He thumbed to the letter " K " and wrote the number on a scratch pad . He picked up his telephone and dialed . " Senator ? Walter Madison .... " A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no connection between his new clients and the events of the evening at the Plaza Hotel . The Senator had been horrified . And frightened .  | THE CLOSED hearing comprised eight senators , as diversified as possible within the opposing camps , and the candidate for confirmation , Andrew Trevayne . Trevayne took his seat , Walter Madison beside him , and looked up at the raised platform . On the platform was the usual long table with the necessary number of chairs , microphones in their places in front of each chair , and the flag of the United States centered against the wall . A small desk with a stenotype machine was below the platform on the main level . Men were standing around in groups talking with one another , gesturing with quiet intensity . The clock reached two-thirty , and the groups began to disperse . An elderly man Trevayne recognized as the senior Senator from Nebraska  --  or was it Wyoming  --  climbed the three steps of the platform and walked to one of the two center chairs . His name was Gillette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " May we clear the room , please ? " It was the sign for those not part of the hearing to leave quickly . Last-second instructions were given and received , and Trevayne was aware that he was the object of a great many looks . A youngish man dressed in a sober , dark suit approached the table and put an ashtray in front of Trevayne . He smiled awkwardly , as if he wished he could say something . It was a curious moment . The panel of senators began assembling ; cordialities were exchanged . Trevayne saw that the smiles were abrupt , artificial ; a taut atmosphere prevailed . It was emphasized by an incident that would have gone unnoticed under more relaxed conditions . Senator Alan Knapp , mid-forties , straight black hair combed carefully back from his wide forehead , pressed the button on his microphone and blew through the  | meshed globe . The amplified rush of air caused a number of the panel to react sharply . They looked  --  apprehensively , perhaps at their colleague . It might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made the reactions so totally serious . Another curious moment . Old Senator Gillette  --  Wyoming ? No , it was Nebraska , thought Trevayne  --  perceived the tension and rapidly , softly tapped the gavel . He cleared his throat and assumed the responsibility of the chair . " Gentlemen . Distinguished colleagues , Mr. Undersecretary . Senate hearing number six-four-one commences session on this date at the hour of two-thirty ; so let the record state . " As the stenotypist , staring at nothing , effortlessly touched the muted keys , Trevayne realized that the " Undersecretary " was himself . He had been " Mr. Undersecretary " ; an undersecretary , one of many . " Having been appointed generously by my colleagues as chairman of this hearing , I shall open with the usual statement outlining the purposes of our gathering . At the conclusion of this brief statement I welcome any additions or clarifications  --  I hope no contradictions , as our objective is fully bipartisan . " There were perceptible nods of agreement , several unhumored smiles , one or two deep breaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a folder in front of him and opened it . His voice had the drone of a court-martial charge . " The state of the defense economy is appalling ; an opinion shared by every knowledgeable citizen . As elected representatives , it is our duty-by-oath to use the powers granted us by the Constitution to ascertain these deficiencies and correct them wherever possible . We can and should do no less . We have made provision for the forming of an investigative subcommittee , so requested by the Defense Allocation Commission  --  a subcommittee the purpose of which is to make a thorough study of the major contracts now existing and submitted for congressional approval between the Department of Defense and those corporations doing business with Defense . To limit the scope of the inquiry  --  and surely it must be limited , for reasons of time  --  an arbitrary contractural figure of one-point-five million has been suggested for the subcommittee 's guidelines . All Defense agreements in excess of this amount are subject to the scrutiny of the subcommittee . It will , however , be at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Our purpose this afternoon is to examine and confirm or deny  | the appointment of Mr. Andrew Trevayne , formerly Undersecretary of State , to the position of chairman of the above-mentioned subcommittee . This hearing is closed , and the record will remain classified for an indeterminate period , so I urge my colleagues to search their consciences , and where doubts exist , should they exist , express them . Again , further ? " " Mr. Chairman . " Andrew Trevayne 's soft-spoken , hesitant interruption so startled everyone in the room that even the stenotypist lost his appearance of uninterest and looked over at the man who had dared to interrupt the opening remarks of the chair . Walter Madison instinctively reached out and put his hand on Trevayne 's arm . " Mr. Trevayne ? ... Mr. Undersecretary ? " asked the bewildered Gillette . " I apologize .... Perhaps this is n't the time ; I 'm sorry . " " What is it , sir ? " " It was a matter of clarification ; it can wait . My apologies again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aquiline Senator Knapp . " The Undersecretary 's lack of courtesy to the chair is strange , indeed . If he has anything to say in the nature of clarification , it certainly can wait for the proper time . " " I 'm not that familiar with procedures , Senator . I did n't want it to slip my mind . You 're right , of course . " Trevayne reached for a pencil , as if to write a note . " It must have struck you as most pertinent , Mr. Undersecretary . " It was the Senator from New Mexico who now spoke ; a man in his fifties , a respected chicano . It was apparent that he disliked Alan Knapp 's intimidating rebuke . " It did , sir . " Trevayne lowered his eyes to the paper . There was a momentary silence in the room . The interruption was now complete . " Very well , Mr. Trevayne . " Senator Gillette seemed unsure of himself . " It 's quite possible that you are correct , though unorthodox . I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrosanct . I 've been tempted far too often to cut them short myself . Please . Your clarification , Mr. Undersecretary . " " Thank you , sir . You stated that it was the responsibility of this panel to search for and express doubts .... I 'm not sure how to say it , but I feel that a similar responsibility is shared by this table . Quite honestly , I 've had doubts myself , Mr. Chairman . " " Doubts , Mr. Trevayne ? " asked Mitchell Armbruster , the small , compact Senator from California whose wit was as much a part of his reputation as his judgment . " We 're born with doubts ; at least , we grow  | to recognize them . What doubts do you refer to ? Pertinent to this hearing , I mean . " " That this subcommittee will be given the degree of cooperation it needs in order to function . I sincerely hope the panel will consider the implications of this question . " " That sounds suspiciously like an ultimatum , Mr. Trevayne . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be totally unwarranted . " " It nevertheless strikes me that your implications ' are insulting . Is it your intention to put the Senate of the United States on trial here ? " continued Knapp . " I was n't aware that this was a trial , " replied Trevayne pleasantly , without answering the question . " Damn good point , " added Armbruster with a smile . " Very well , Mr. Undersecretary , " said Gillette . " Your clarification has been placed into the record and duly noted by this panel . Is that satisfactory ? " " It is , and thank you again , Mr. Chairman . " " Then I shall conclude my opening remarks , and we may proceed . " Gillette droned on for several minutes , outlining the questions which should be raised and answered . They fell into two categories . First , the qualifications of Andrew Trevayne for the position under consideration , and second , the all-important factor of conceivable conflicts of interest . At his conclusion , the chairman made the customary statement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous in-clusions ? " " Mr. Chairman ? " " The Senator from Vermont is recognized . " James Norton , early sixties , close-cropped gray hair , down-easter accent very pronounced , looked at Trevayne . " Mr. Undersecretary . The distinguished chairman has described the areas of this inquiry in his usual clear and forthright manner . And we certainly will raise the questions of competence and conflict . However , I submit there is a third territory that should be explored . That is your philosophy , Mr. Undersecretary . You might say , where you stand . Would you grant that privilege to us ? " " No objections , Senator . " Trevayne smiled . " I might even hope that we could exchange such views . My own and the panel 's collective position , of course , relative to the subcommittee . "  | We arc not standing for confirmation ! " Alan Knapp 's voice crackled harshly through the speakers . " 1 respectfully refer the Senator to my previous remarks , " answered Trevayne softly . " Mr. Chairman ? " Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked up at the platform . " May I have a word with my client , if you please . " " Certainly , Mr .... Madison . " The Senate panel , in the courtesy of such hearings , talked among themselves and shuffled papers . Most , however , kept their eyes on Trevayne and Walter Madison . " Andy , what are you doing ? Are you trying to deliberately confuse the issues ? " " I made my point ... . " Unforgettably . Why ? " " I want to make sure there 's no misunderstanding . I want this record to specify  --  not indicate , but specify  --  that I 'm putting everyone on notice . If they clear me , they do so knowing what I expect from them . " " For God 's sake , man , you 're reversing the function of the hearing . You 're confirming the Senate ! " " I guess I am . " " What 's your point ? What are you trying to do ? " " Setting up the battleground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to ; they 'll have to . It 'll be because I 've challenged them . " " Challenged them ? What for ? What about ? " " Because there 's a profound difference between us . " " What does that mean ? " " It means we 're natural enemies . " Trevayne smiled . " You 're crazy ! " " If I am , I 'll apologize . Let 's get this over with . " Trevayne looked up at the panel . He took the time to rest his eyes on each place , each member . " Mr. Chairman , my attorney and I have concluded our discussion . " " Yes . Yes , of course . . . . I believe the Senator from Vermont submitted an addition in the form of the Undersecretary 's . . . basic philosophy . The chair assumes that to mean fundamental political beliefs  --  not partisan  --  but of a more general application . None other are pertinent to this hearing . " Gillette looked over his glasses at Vermont 's Norton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perfectly acceptable , Mr. Chairman . "  | " I was hoping it would he , Senator , " added California 's Armbruster with a chuckle . Armbruster and Norton were not only from different sides of the aisle , but as separated in partisan politics as their states were in geography . Knapp spoke without petitioning the chair . " If I 'm not mistaken , the Undersecretary countered our colleague 's addition with one of his own . I think he said he reserved the right to raise similar questions with the members of this panel . A right I seriously doubt should be granted . " " I do n't believe I made such a request , Senator . " Trevayne spoke softly but with firmness into his microphone . " If it was so construed , I apologize . I have no right  --  or reason  --  to question your individual persuasions . I 'm concerned only that this panel , as one deliberative body , assure me , as I must assure it , of a sense of commitment . A collective commitment . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from West Virginia , a man named Talley . He was little known outside the club , but within it was well liked , as much for his easygoing temperament as for his intelligence . " Senator Talley . " " I 'd like to ask Mr. Trevayne why he even raises the issue . We want the same thing ; none of us would be here otherwise . Frankly , I thought this would be one of the shortest hearings on record . Speaking personally , I have great confidence in you , sir . Is n't that confidence returned ? If not personally , at least collectively  --  to use your term , sir ? " Trevayne looked over at the chairman , silently requesting permission to answer the question . Senator Gillette nodded . " Of course , it is , Senator Talley . And immense respect . It 's precisely because of my confidence in you , my respect for you , that I wish to be able to refer to this transcript and have it specify that we 've understood each other . The subcommittee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible backing of such impartial and influential men as yourselves . " Trevayne paused and ingenuously looked from one side of the panel table to the other . " If you confirm me , gentlemen , and incidentally , I hope that you do , I 'm going to need help . " The West Virginian did not notice the discomfort of several colleagues . " Let me then rephrase my supplication , Mr. Undersecretary . I 'm old enough , or naive enough , or perhaps both , to believe that men of good will  --  albeit different opinions  --  can join together in a common cause . The confidence you seek in us I might hope would be documented by what we say to one another in this room . Should it not be to your satisfaction , you have every right to bring it up . Why not find out first ? "  | " I could n't hope for sounder advice , Senator Talley . I 'm afraid my initial nervousness clouded my perspective . I 'll try not to raise the issue again . " Gillette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trevayne , and when he spoke , it was clear that he was annoyed . " You may raise whatever issues you wish , sir . As will this panel . " He looked down at the legal pad in front of him , at his own notations . " Senator Norton . You brought up the aspect of Mr. Trevayne 's general philosophy . Would you amplify  --  briefly , if you please  --  so we may clear the question and get on . I presume you wish to be satisfied that our guest at least nominally endorses the fundamental laws of the land . " " Mr. Undersecretary . " Norton 's heavy Vermont dialect seemed more pronounced than necessary as he eyed the candidate . Norton always knew when to use the Yankee approach . It had served him well in many such Senate hearings  --  especially when television cameras were on the premises . It made him seem so bound-to-the-earth American . " I shall be brief ; for both our sakes . . . . I 'd like to ask you if you do subscribe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course , I do . " Trevayne was surprised by the naivete of the question . But not for long . " Mr. Chairman . . . " Alan Knapp spoke as if on cue . " I , for one , am frankly disturbed by an aspect of the Undersecretary 's political history . Mr. Undersecretary , you 're what is known as an . . . independent , if I 'm not mistaken . " " That 's correct . " " That 's interesting . Of course , I 'm aware that in many sectors the term political independent ' is revered . It has a nice , rugged sound to it . " That 's not my intention , Senator . " " But there 's another aspect of such a posture , " continued Knapp without acknowledging Trevayne 's answer . " And I do n't find it particularly independent . . . . Mr. Trevayne , it 's true , is it not , that your companies profited considerably from government contracts  --  especially during the maximum space expenditures ? " " True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I would hope so ... . I wonder , however , if your lack of partisanship was n't perhaps shaped by other than ideological motivations. fly being neither on one side nor the other , you certainly removed yourself from any political conflict , did n't you ? " " Again , not my intention . " " I mean , it would be difficult for anyone to take issue with you on  | political grounds , since your opinions were . . . are . . . buried under the classification of independent . ' " " Just one minute , Senator ! " The chairman , visibly upset , spoke sharply . " I 'd like to comment , if I may ? " " You may , Mr. Trevayne , after my own observations . Senator Knapp , I thought I 'd made it clear that this is a bipartisan hearing . I find your remarks irrelevant and , frankly , distasteful . Now , you may comment , Mr. Undersecretary . " " I 'd like to inform the Senator that anyone , at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . I 'm not shy . On the other hand , I was n't aware that government contracts were granted on the basis of political affiliations . " " Exactly my point , Mr. Trevayne . " Knapp turned toward the center of the table . " Mr. Chairman , in my seven years in the Senate I have many times supported those whose politics differed from my own and , conversely , denied support to members of my own party . In such cases my approval or disapproval was based on the specific questions on the floor . As men of conscience , we all practice the same ethics . What bothers me about our candidate is that he elects to be called non-partisan . ' That worries me . I fear such people in places of power . I wonder at their so-called independence . I wonder , if , instead , it 's merely a convenience to be a companion of the strongest wind ? " There was a momentary silence in the room . Gillette removed his glasses and turned toward Knapp . " Hypocrisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forgive me , Mr. Chairman . You asked us to search our consciences . . . . As was pointed out by Justice Brandeis , honesty by itself is not enough . The appearance of integrity must be concomitant . Caesar 's wife , Mr. Chairman . " " Are you suggesting , Senator , that I join a political party ? " asked Trevayne incredulously . " I 'm not suggesting anything . I 'm raising doubts , which is the function of this panel . " John Morris , Senator from Illinois , broke his silence . He was the youngest man on the panel , in his mid-thirties , and a brilliant attorney . Whenever Morris was assigned to a committee , he was invariably called the " house teen-ager . " It was a substitute for another phrase . For Morris was black , a negro who had swiftly worked his way up within the system . " You have n't . . . Oh , Mr. Chairman ? " " Go ahead , Senator . "  | " You have n't raised a doubt , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused a large segment of the voting public of potential deceit . You 've relegated it to a position of . . . of a second-class franchise . I understand the subtleties you employ , even grant their validity in certain situations . I do n't think they apply here . " The Senator from New Mexico , the admired chicano , leaned forward and looked at Morris as he spoke . " There are two of us here who understand only too well the meaning of a second-class franchise , Senator . In my opinion , the issue is valid  --  to be raised , that is . One always looks for checks and balances ; that 's the meaning of our system . However , I think , also , that once having been raised , the issue can be put to rest by a succinct answer from the man standing for confirmation . . .. Mr. Undersecretary ? For the record , may we assume that you are not a . . . sworn companion of the wind ? That your judgiiients are , indeed , as independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That 's what I thought . I have no further questions on this subject . " " Senator ? " " Yes , Mr. Trevayne ? " " Are yours ? " " I beg your pardon ? " " Are yours ? Are your judgments  --  and the judgments of every member of this panel  --  independent of external pressures ? " Several senators started talking angrily at once into their microphones ; Armbruster of California laughed , Senator Weeks of Maryland 's Eastern Shore stifled a smile by withdrawing a handkerchief from his well-tailored blazer , and the chairman reached for the gavel . As order was restored by the rapid clatter of Gillette 's hammer , Vermont 's Norton touched the sleeve of Senator Knapp . It was a sign . Their eyes met , and Norton shook his head  --  imperceptibly , but the message was clear . Knapp lifted up the pad in front of him and unobtrusively removed a file folder . He reached down for his briefcase and opened it , slipping the folder inside . On the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | THE RECESS was called at four-fifteen , the hearing to be resumed at five o'clock . The forty-five minutes would give everyone a chance to call home , rearrange minor schedules , confer with aides , dismiss assistants outside . Since the eruption of Andrew 's polite but explosively unexpected question , Gillette had managed to steer the inquiry rapidly through the ensuing invective and reach less abstract ground in Trevayne 's qualifications . Andrew was prepared ; his answers were quick , concise , and complete . He surprised even Walter Madison , who was rarely surprised by his extraordinary client . Trevayne had no need of the numerous pages and charts filled with past figures and long-ago estimates . He rattled off facts and explanations with such assurance that even those who tried to sustain their antagonism found it difficult . His total command of his own past economic relationships frequently left the panel speechless  --  and led Senator Gillette to voice the opinion that following a recess , they might conclude the hearing by seven that night  --  at the latest . " You 're hot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he rose from his chair . " I have n't begun , counselor . That 's in act two . " " Do n't revert to Charlie Brown , please . You 're doing fine . We 'll be out of here by six o'clock . They think you 're a computer , with a human thought process ; do n't louse it up . " " Tell them , Walter . Tell them not to louse it up . " " Jesus , Andy ! What are you ? " " Very impressive performance , young man . " The elderly Talley , the former county judge from the state of West Virginia , walked up to the two of them , unaware that he was intruding.  | " " Thank you , sir . My attorney , Walter Madison . " The men shook hands . You must feel somewhat unnecessary , I should think , Mr. Madison . It 's not often you high-powered New York lawyers get off so easy . " " I 'm used to it with him , Senator . It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means it is n't , or you could n't afford to say so . I was on the bench for damn near twenty years . " Alan Knapp joined the group , and Trevayne felt himself grow tense . He did n't like Knapp , not only because of his unwarranted rudeness , but because Knapp had about him the unhealthy look of an inquisitor . What had Ambassador Hill said ? What were Big Billy 's words ? ... we do n't want an inquisitor ... " But the Knapp now standing in front of Trevayne did not seem to he the same man who sat so coldly on the dais . He was smiling affably , infectiously , as he shook Trevayne 's hand . " You 're doing splendidly ! You really are . You must have boned up for this like the chief does for a televised press conference . . . . Senator ? Mr. Madison ? " Hands were again shaken , the camaraderie so opposed to the atmosphere of five minutes ago . Trevayne felt uncomfortable , artificial ; and he did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier for me , " he said , smiling coldly at Knapp . " Oh , Lord , do n't personalize it , man . I do my job ; you do yours . Right , Madison ? Is n't that right , Senator ? " West Virginia 's Talley did not agree as quickly as Madison . " I suppose so , Alan . I 'm not a scrapper , so I do n't cotton to the unpleasantness . Must admit , though , it does n't bother most of you . " " Never think about it .... " " I 'll substantiate that , gentlemen . " It was Armbruster of California , who spoke between puffs on his pipe . " Nice work , Trevayne .... Tell you all something . Knapp was in the process of crucifying his  --  the President 's  --  H.E.W . man , I mean nailing him hands and feet , and yet when the hearing was over , the two of them could n't wait to talk to each other . I thought , God damn , they 're young enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurrying out to get a taxi . Their wives were waiting for them at a restaurant . You 're an original , Senator . " Knapp laughed . " Did you know he was an usher at my wedding fifteen years ago ? The President 's H.E.W . appointment ? "  | " Mr. Undersecretary ? " At first the title did n't register on Trevayne . Then a hand was placed on his shoulder . It was Norton of Vermont . " May I see you a minute ? " Trevayne stepped away from the group as Madison and Knapp argued a fine point of law and Armbruster questioned Talley as to the upcoming autumn hunting in West Virginia . " Yes , Senator ? " " I 'm sure everyone 's told you by now . You 're tacking right through the rough waters , and a port 's in sight . We 'll be outta here by twelve bells .... " " I 'm from Boston , Senator , and I like sailing , but I 'm not a whaling man . What is it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you deserve them , let me tell you . I 've conferred briefly with several of my colleagues ; as a fact , we also spoke at length before the hearing . We want you to know that we feel as the President does . You 're the very best man for the job . " " You 'll forgive me if I find the methods of endorsement a little strange . " Norton smiled the thin-lipped smile of a Yankee tradesman  --  and he was trading now , no doubt about it . " Not strange , Trevayne . Merely necessary . You see , young fella , you 're in the hot spot . In case anything goes wrong  --  which nobody thinks will , by the way  --  this hearing 's got to be one of the strongest on record . Try to understand that ; it 's nothing personal . " " That 's what Knapp said . " " He 's right . . . . I do n't suppose old Talley understands , though . Hell , down in West Virginia they do n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously , that is . " " Then Talley is n't one of the colleagues you met with . " " Frankly , no . " " And you still have n't said what you wanted to say , have you ? " " Goddamn , fella , just slow down ! I 'm trying to explain a point of procedure so you 'll understand . The confirmation 's yours . . . . That is , it will be , unless you force us into opposition . None of us would like that . " Trevayne looked hard at Norton ; he 'd seen many lean and wrinkled men like this bending over farm fences or squinting beyond the dunes out at the sea in Marblehead . One never knew how much perception was hidden in those weathered eyes . " Look , Senator , all I want from this panel is the assurance that the subcommittee will act  | as a free agent . If I ca n't get your active assistance , 1 at least need your guarantee that you 'll protect the subcommittee from interference . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Yankee peddler fingering his merchandise . " Free agent ? Eheah .... Well , let me tell you , son . Some people get a touch nervous when a man insists that he 's got to be a . . . free agent ; that he wo n't tolerate pressures . You ca n't help but wonder . There 's good pressures and not-so-good pressures . Nobody likes the latter , but good pressures , that 's something else again . It 's comforting to know that a man is accountable to somebody other than God , is n't that so ? " " Certainly , I 'd be accountable . I never expected otherwise . " " But it 's kind of a second thought , is n't it ? ... The intent of this subcommittee is not to satisfy the personal ego of any one man , Trevayne . It has a job to do that 's bigger than any one person . You may not have the temperament for it . That 's what I mean by intent . ' We do n't want a Savonarola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Yankee was trading abstractions as though they were horseflesh , and he was good at it . He never once hinted that he was anything but the philosophical salt of the good brown earth . Trevayne stared back , trying to pry loose the hypocrisy he felt was behind Norton 's words . It was n't possible . " You 'll have to make that decision , Senator . " " Do you mind if I have a word with your attorney ? What 's his name ? " " Madison . Walter Madison . No objection at all . However , I think he 'll tell you that I 'm a terrible client . He 's convinced I never pay attention when I should . " " No harm trying , young fella . You 're obstinate . But I like you . " Norton turned and walked toward Madison and Knapp . Trevayne looked at his watch . In twenty minutes the hearing would resume . He 'd try the hotel and see if Phyllis was back from shopping . The President had urged him to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House with her husband after the hearing . Another photograph would be taken showing the President endorsing Trevayne personally  --  this time with Trevayne 's wife by his side . Phyllis had understood . James Norton extended his hand to Madison and if anyone in the room had been watching them it would have been assumed that the Senator was merely introducing himself .  | It was n't the case . " Goddamn , Madison ! What the hell is this ! ? " Norton spoke with quiet urgency . " He smells something ! You did n't tell us that ! " " I did n't know it ! I just told Knapp , I do n't know what 's going on . " " You 'd better find out , " said Alan Knapp coldly . The hearing resumed at seven minutes past five , the delay due to three senators unable to complete their outside business . The seven minutes , however , gave Walter Madison a chance to speak with his client alone at the table . " That fellow Norton talked to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " Andy , there 's a logic in what he says . They 're not going to confirm you if they think you 're going to play power broker . If you were in their shoes , you would n't either . You 'd be rougher than they are , and I think you know that . " " Agreed . " " What 's bothering you , then ? " Trevayne spoke , looking straight ahead . " I 'm not that sure I want the job , Walter . I certainly do n't want it if I ca n't do it my way . I told you that ; I said it to Baldwin and Robert Webster , too . " Trevayne now turned to his attorney . " There 's nothing in my record that gives credence to the Savonarola charge . " " The what ? " " That 's what Norton threw at me . Savonarola . You called it ' power broker . ' That 's not me , and they know it . . . . If I 'm confirmed , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every senator on this panel , and if I need assistance , get it without argument . I must be able to do that . . . . This panel was n't chosen indiscriminately , by straws . Each of these men 's states is heavily committed to Pentagon contracts ; a few less than the others , but they 're a minority  --  window dressing . The Senate knew exactly what it was doing when it put this crowd together . The only way I can make sure that subcommittee is n't interfered with by the Senate is to force these watchdogs of their own constituencies on the defensive . " " What ? " " Make them justify themselves to me ... in the transcript . This panel will have to go on record as being a necessary adjunct to the subcommittee . A working partnership . " " They wo n't do it ! The purpose here is to confirm you , that 's all . There 's no other requirements . "  | " ' There is if I make perfectly clear that the subcommittee ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active participation of this panel in particular . If I ca n't get a commitment from them , there 's no point in continuing . " Madison stared at his client . " And what 'll you gain by this ? " " They become a working part of the . . . inquisition . Each man an inquisitor himself , none sure of the extent of his distinguished colleague 's ' involvement . . . . Share the wealth , share the responsibility . " " And share the risks ? " asked Madison softly . " You said it ; I did n't . " " What happens if they turn you down ? " Trevayne looked up at the gathering panel of senators . His eyes were remote , his voice flat and cold . " I 'll call a press conference tomorrow morning that will rip this goddamn city apart . " Walter Madison knew there was nothing more to be said . Trevayne knew it had to come out of the proceedings . Come as a slowly revealed necessity ; logically , without stress . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . Not surprisingly , it was old Senator Talley , the gnarled county judge from West Virginia ; a minority member , window dressing . Not one of Norton 's " colleagues . " It happened at five-fifty-seven . Talley leaned forward , looking at the chair ; receiving the floor , he turned to the candidate and spoke . " Mr. Trevayne , if I understand you , and I think I do , your primary concern is the degree of practical cooperation you 'll get from those of us who can offer it . I can understand that ; it 's a valid point . . . . Well , you should know , sir , that the Senate of the United States is not merely a great deliberative body , but a coming together of dedicated gentlemen . I 'm sure I speak for all when I tell you that my office is open to you , sir . There are a number of government installations in the state of West Virginia ; I hope you 'll use whatever information my office can provide . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government installations ! " Thank you , Senator Talley . Not only for your offer , but for clarifying a practical issue . Thank you again , sir . I would hope that you speak for all . " California 's Armbruster smiled and spoke slowly . " Would you have any reason to think otherwise ? " " None whatsoever . "  | " But you 'd feel more confident , " continued the Californian , " more desirous of our endorsement , if the proceedings this afternoon included a joint resolution to aid your subcommittee in every way we can . " " I would , Senator . " Armbruster turned to the center of the table . " I find nothing objectionable in that request , Mr. Chairman . " " So be it . " Gillette has been staring at Trevayne . He rapped his gavel harshly , just once . " Let the record state ... " It happened . One by one the senators made their individual statements , each as sincere , each as genuine as the preceding declaration . Trevayne sat back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrases he knew he would soon commit to memory . He had managed it ; he had maneuvered the panel into its voluntary resolution . It made little difference that few , if any , would honor the words . It would be nice but it did n't really matter . What mattered was the fact that he could point to them , quote them repeatedly . Webster at the White House had promised him a copy of the transcript ; it would be a simple thing to leak isolated sections to the press . Gillette looked down from his perch of sanctum sanctorum at Trevayne . His voice was flat , his eyes  --  enlarged behind the bifocal lenses of his glasses  --  cold and hostile . " Does the candidate wish to make a statement before he is excused ? " Andrew returned the chairman 's stare . " I do , sir . " " I might hope it could be brief , Mr. Undersecretary , " said Gillette . " The panel must try to conclude its business  --  at the President 's request  --  and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Chairman . " Trevayne separated a page from the papers in front of him and looked up at the senators . He did not smile ; he did not convey any measure of emotion whatsoever . He spoke simply . " Before you conclude the business of confirming or denying my appointment , gentlemen , I think you should be aware of the results of the preliminary studies I 've made . They will serve as the basis for my approach  --  the subcommittee 's approach  --  should confirmation be granted . And since this is a closed hearing , I 'm confident that my remarks will go no farther . . . . I have spent the past several weeks  --  courtesy of the Controller General 's office  --  analyzing the defense commitments with the following companies and corporations : Lockheed Aircraft , I.T.T . Corporation , General Motors , Ling-Tempco ,  | Litton , and ( icncssec Industries . It is my judgment that one , two or possibly three have acted either individually or in concert to achieve extraordinary authority within the decision-making processes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From everything I 've been able to fit together , I must tell you now that I firmly believe it is one company that has been primarily involved in this malfeasance . I recognize the severity of the charge ; it will be my intention to justify it , and until I do , I will not name that company . That is my statement , Mr. Chairman . " The room was silent . Each member of the panel kept his eyes on Andrew Trevayne ; none spoke , none moved . Senator Gillette reached for the gavel , then stopped and withdrew his hand . He spoke quietly . " You are excused , Mr. Undersecretary . . . . And thank you . " TREVAYNE paid the taxi and got out in front of the hotel . It was warm , the night breeze tepid . September in Washington . He looked at his watch ; it was nearly nine-thirty , and he was starved . Phyllis had said she would order dinner in their rooms . She claimed to be exhausted from shopping ; a quiet dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two round-the-clock guards  --  courtesy of the White House  --  in the hotel corridor . A goddamned hotel corridor . Trevayne started for the revolving door on the right when a chauffeur who 'd been standing by the main entrance came up to him . " Mr. Trevayne ? " " Yes ? " " Would you be so kind , sir ? " The man gestured toward the curb , to a black Ford LTD , obviously a government-rented automobile . Trevayne approached the car and saw Senator Gillette , his glasses still on the bridge of his nose , his expression still half-scowling , seated in the back . The window electronically rolled down , and the old gentleman leaned forward .  | " Could you spare me five minutes , Mr. Undersecretary ? Laurence here will just drive us around the block . " " Of course . " Trevayne climbed into the back scat . " Most everyone thinks spring in Washington is the best season , " said Gillette as the car started off down the street . " I do n't . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary . " " Not necessarily . Or maybe I 'm contrary , too . September and October are the best months for me . Especially in New England . " " Hell , everybody says that . All your poets . . . . The colors , I imagine . " " Probably . " Trevayne looked at the politician , and his expression carried the message . " But I did n't ask you to take a drive in order to discuss your New England autumn , did I ? " " I would n't think so . " " No , no , of course , I did n't .... Well , you have your confirmation . Are you pleased ? " " Naturally . " " That 's gratifying , " said the Senator with disinterest , looking out the window . " You 'd think the traffic would ease up by now , but it wo n't . Goddamn tourists ; they should turn off the Mall lights . All the lights . " Gillette turned to Trevayne . " In all my years in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactical arrogance , Mr. Undersecretary . . . . Perhaps you were subtler , with more honeybuckets , than Bloated Joe  --  I refer to the deceased and not too distinguished McCarthy , of course  --  but your objectives were every bit as censurable . " " I do n't agree with you . " " Oh ? . . . If it was n't tactical , it was instinctive . That 's even more dangerous . If I believed that , I 'd reconvene the hearing and do my damnedest to have you denied . " " Then you should have made your feelings known this afternoon . " " What ? And hand you your issue wrapped in ribbons ? Come , Mr. Undersecretary , you 're not talking to old Judge Talley . Oh , no ! I went right along with you . I gave every one of us a very vocal opportunity to join your holy crusade ! Nothing else would do ! No , sir ! There was no alternative , and you know it . " " Why would there be an alternative tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Because I 'd have eighteen hours to pull apart every week of your life , young man . Pull it apart , rearrange a number of ingredients ,  | and put it all back together again . When l got finished , you 'd be on the Attorney General 's list . " It was Trcvayne 's turn to look out the window . The President had said it ; this was the town for it . It could happen so easily because accusations always appeared on page one , denials on page thirty , apologies on page forty-eight , sandwiched between cheap advertisements . That was the town ; that was the way things were . But he did n't need the town . He did n't have to accept the way things were , and it was about time he let people know it . " Then why do n't you do just that , Mr. Chairman . " It was not a question . " Because I phoned Frank Baldwin . . . . And why do n't you call a halt to that arrogance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trevayne was thrown by Baldwin 's name . " What did Baldwin say ? " " That you would n't have done what you did unless you 'd been provoked . Mightily provoked . He said he 's known you damn near ten years ; he could n't be mistaken . " " I see . " Trevayne reached into his pocket for cigarettes and lit one . " And you accepted that ? " " If Frank Baldwin told me every astronaut was a fairy , I 'd consider it holy writ . . . . What I want to know from you is , what hap-pened ? " " Nothing . Nothing . . . happened . " " You did n't force every senator on that panel to counter your insinuations of guilt with protestations of innocence for no reason ! Because that 's what you did ! You ridiculed the process of confirmation . ... And I did n't appreciate it , sir . " " Do you people always add a sir ' when you 're pontificating ? " " There are a number of ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm sure you 're a master , Mr. Chairman . " " Was Frank Baldwin right ? Were you provoked . . . mightily ? And by whom ? " Trevayne tapped his cigarette carefully on the rim of the ashtray and looked at the older man . " Assuming there was provocation , what would you do about it ? " " Ascertain first whether it was provocation and not an incident or incidents magnified out of proportion , easily resolved . Should provocation prove to be the case , I 'd call those responsible into my office and  | run them out of Washington .... This subcommittee is not to he tampered with . " " You sound as if you mein that . " " 1 do , sir . The time is due and overdue for this work to begin . If there 's been any interference , any attempt to seek influence , I want it stopped in the strongest measures possible . " " I think I accomplished that this afternoon . " " Are you telling me there were senators in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have no idea . " " Then what are you saying ? " " There was provocation , I 'll admit that ; where it emanated from , I do n't know . I just know that if it continues , I 'm in the position of spreading it around . Or stopping it completely . " " If there was impropriety , it is incumbent upon you to report it . " " To whom ? " " To the proper authorities ; there are any number ! " " Maybe I did . " " Then you were obliged to inform the panel ! " " Mr. Chairman , that hearing was loaded this afternoon . The majority of those men represent states whose economies are largely dependent on government installations and contracts . " " You 've judged us all guilty ! " " I 've judged no one . I 'm only taking measures that seem appropriate under the circumstances . Measures to make sure these men can not hinder me . " " You 're wrong ; you 've misinterpreted . " Old Gillette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching Trevayne 's hotel . He leaned forward in the seat . " Pull up , Laurence . We 'll only be a few moments . . . . Trevayne , I find your judgment lacking . You make surface observations and proceed to draw erroneous conclusions . You deliver inflammatory insinuations and refuse to justify them . Most damaging , you withhold pertinent and , I gather , extraordinary information , setting yourself up as an arbitrary censor of what the Senate may be told . In my opinion , Frank Baldwin and his commission made a great mistake in recommending you ; the President , too , is in error following their lead . . . . Tomorrow morning I shall insist upon a reconvening of the panel and use all the powers of my office to have your confirmation withdrawn . Your arrogance is not in keeping with the public interest ; you 'll have your chance to answer then . Good night , sir . "  | Trevayne opened the door and stepped out on the curb . Before closing it he bent down and spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next eighteen hours to . . . what was it ? Oh , yes . To pull apart my life week by week . " " I would n't waste my time , Mr. Undersecretary . You 're not worth it . You 're a damned fool . " Gillette reached over to his left and touched a button . The car window rose as Trevayne pushed the door shut . " Congratulations , darling ! " Phyllis jumped up from the chair and dropped her magazine on the lamp table . " I heard it on the seven o'clock news . " Trevayne closed the door and walked into his wife 's arms , kissing her lightly on the lips . " Well , do n't go out and rent a house yet . It 's not settled . " " What are you talking about ? They interrupted some local story to read the bulletin . I was so proud ; they said it was a bulletin . You , a bulletin ! " " I 've got another flash for them . They may have a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What ? " " I 've just spent a startling few minutes riding around the block with the distinguished chairman of the hearing . I 'm leaving messages for Walter all over New York . I 've got to talk to him . " " What in heaven 's name are you saying ? " Trevayne had crossed to the telephone and picked it up . He gestured to his wife to hold her questions until he 'd finished his calls . She was used to this ; she went to the hotel window and looked out over the lighted city . Her husband spoke first to Madison 's wife , and when the conversation ended , he pressed the button , holding the telephone in his hand . He had n't been satisfied with Mrs. Madison 's words  --  Mrs. Madison was not the most reliable woman after seven o'clock in the evening . He released the button and put through a call to La Guardia Airport , to the airline desk of the Washington shuttle . " If he does n't call back in an hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane gets in at ten-something , " he said , hanging up . " What happened ? " Phyllis saw that her husband was not only angry , but confused . Andy was n't often confused . " He surprised me . For the wrong reasons . He said my arrogance was n't in keeping with the public interest ; I withheld facts . Also , I was a damned fool . " " Who said it ? "  | " Gillette . " Trevayne took off his jacket and threw it on a chair . " From his viewpoint , he 's probably right . On the other hand , I know damned well I 'm right . He may be the most honorable man in Congress ; probably is , but that does n't mean he can guarantee the rest of them . He may want to , but that does n't mean it 's so . " Phyllis understood her husband 's non sequiturs ; he 'd told her what he intended doing that afternoon . At least , the objectives . " This was the man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venerable Gillette . He says he 's going to reconvene the panel and withdraw the confirmation . " " Can he do that ? I mean , after they gave it to you ? " " I guess so . He 'll call it new disclosures , or something . . . . Sure he can . " " Then you got them to agree , to work with you . " " Sort of . On the record , anyway . Webster was getting me the transcript tomorrow . But that 's not it . " " This Gillette saw through what you were doing ? " " They all did ! " Trevayne laughed . " Most of them looked like they 'd swallowed mouthfuls of papier-mache . . . . Oh , they 'll be relieved as hell ! Just the fact that I withheld information will be sufficient . " " What are you going to do ? " " First , see if my desk at Danforth can be salvaged . It 's probably too late , but it 's worth trying ; I do like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important question : how far can I go tomorrow afternoon without being subject to a subpoena from the Justice Department ? " He looked at his wife . " Andy , I think you should tell them exactly what happened . " " I wo n't do that . " " You 're far more sensitive about it than I am . How many times do I have to tell you . I am not embarrassed . I will not be a freak . Nothing happened ! " " It was ugly . " " Yes , it was . And ugly things happen every day . You think you 're protecting me , and I do n't need that kind of protection . " She walked to the table where she 'd put the magazine and spoke deliberately . " Has it occurred to you that the best protection I might have would be to tell what happened in headlines ? " " It has , and I reject it . That approach simply implants ideas . . . . Like kidnapping . " Phyllis knew there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to talk about it . " All right , " she said , turning to him . " Tomorrow just tell them all to go to hell in a basket and you 'll be happy to buy them the biggest basket made . Tax-deductible , of course . " He saw the hurt in her face and knew in some illogical way she held herself responsible . He went to her and took her into his arms . We do n't really like Washington , anyway . Last time , we could n't wait for the weekends , remember ? We found every excuse we could to get back to Barnegat . " " You 're a sweet man , Andrew . Remind me to buy you a new sailboat . " It was an old joke between them . Years ago when the company was struggling for existence , he once proclaimed that he 'd feel successful only when he could go out and buy a small cat and not think about the price . It had come to mean all things . He released her . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the coffee table , where there was a room-service menu . " Why do you have to talk to Walter ? What can he do ? " " I want him to describe the legal definitions between opinion and factual evaluation . The first gives me plenty of leeway to be angry ; the second invites the Justice Department . " " Is it so important that you be angry ? " Trevayne was reading the menu , but his thoughts were on his wife 's questions . He looked over at her . " Yes , I think it is . Not just for the satisfaction ; I do n't really need that . But because they all consider themselves so damned sacred . Whoever eventually chairs that subcommittee is going to need all the support he can get . If I shake them up a bit , maybe the next nominee will have it easier . " " That 's generous , Andy . " He smiled , carrying the menu over to the telephone . " Not entirely . I 'm going to enjoy watching those pompous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures and percentages from the defense index . The most damaging thing I 'll do tomorrow is simply read them off . All eight states . " Phyllis laughed . " That 's terrible . Oh , Andy , that 's devastating . " " It 's not bad . If I do n't say anything else , it 'd be enough .... Oh , hell , I 'm tired and hungry , and I do n't want to think anymore . I ca n't do anything until I reach Walter . " " Relax . Have something to eat ; take a nap . You look exhausted . " " Talking about exhausted warriors home from battle ... " " Which we weren't. " " ... you look awfully attractive . "  | " Order your dinner .... You might include a nice bottle of red wine , if you 've a mind to . " " I 've a mind to ; you owe me a sailboat . " Phyllis smiled warmly as Trevayne picked up the telephone and asked for room service . She went into the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have dinner and they 'd both finish a bottle of Burgundy and then they 'd make love . She wanted that very much . They lay in the hotel bed , Trevayne 's arm around his wife , her head against his chest . Both still felt the warm effects of the lovemaking and the wine , and there was a splendid comfort between them . As there always was during such moments . Trevayne removed his arm gently and reached for his cigarettes . " I 'm not asleep , " said Phyllis . " You should be ; that 's the way it is in the movies . Smoke ? " " No , thanks . . . . It 's eleven-fifteen . " Phyllis raised herself against the headboard , pulling the sheet over her naked body , looking at the travel clock . " Are you going to try Walter again ? " " In a few minutes . What with the stack-ups and the taxis , he 's probably not home yet . I do n't relish a conversation with Ellen Madison at this hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry for her . " " I still do n't want to talk to her . And he obviously did n't get the message at the terminal . " Phyllis touched her husband 's shoulder , then rubbed his arm affectionately , slowly . It was an unconscious but meaningful touch of ownership . " Andy , are you going to talk to the President ? " " No . I 've kept my part of the bargain . I did n't quit . And I do n't think he 'd appreciate my running to him now . When it 's over , I 'll get the usual solicitous phone call . Probably breakfast , come to think of it , since I wo n't mention him tomorrow . " " He 's going to be grateful for that . He should be . My God , when you think about it . You may lose a job you like ; you 're insulted ; the waste of time ... " " I do n't qualify as a charity case , " interrupted her husband . " I was warned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Trevayne reached for it . " Hello ? " " Mr. Trevayne ? " " Yes ? " " I realize there 's a do-not-disturb ' on your room , but the messages are piling up , and ? "  | " A what ? What do-not-disturb ? I never gave those instructions ! Phyllis ? " " Of course not , " said his wife , shaking her head . " The d-n-d is clearly marked , sir . " " It 's a mistake ! " Trevayne flung his legs over the side of the bed . " What are the messages ? " " The d-n-d was given to the board at nine-thirty-five , sir . " " Now , listen ! We never requested it ! I asked you , what messages ? " The operator paused for a moment ; she was n't going to be abused by forgetful guests . " As I started to say , sir , there 's a Mr. Madison on the line who insisted that I ring through . He said it was urgent . " " Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry ; I do n't know where that goddamned switchboard ? " " Andy , it 's terrible ! I knew you 'd want to talk ; that 's why I insisted . " " What ? " " It 's tragic . It 's a tragedy ! " " How do you know ? Where did you hear it ? " " Hear it ? It 's on every newscast . It 's all over  --  radio , television . " Trevayne held his breath for a split second before speaking . His voice was calm , precise . " Walter , what are you talking about ? " " The Senator . Old Gillette . He was killed a couple of hours ago . Car went out of control over a Fairfax bridge . . . . What 're you talking about ? " THE ACCOUNT of the accident was bizarre enough to be real . According to the hospitalized chauffeur , Laurence Miller , he drove Gillette from midtown  --  no mention of the hotel , none of Trevayne  --  back to the Senate Office Building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-floor office and retrieve a forgotten briefcase . He returned to the car , drove across the Potomac River into Virginia , when the Senator insisted on taking a back route to his Fairfax home . The chauffeur had argued mildly  --  the back road was partially under  | construction , there were no street lamps but the crusty old man was adamant ; Laurence Miller did n't know why . A mile or so from Gillette 's property was one of those small offshoots of the Potomac which infiltrate the Virginia woods . A short , metal-ribbed bridge spanned the water and dipped sharply to the right before the Fairfax entrance . The Senator 's car was at midpoint when another automobile came careening up from the other side approaching the bridge , its headlights at high beam , its speed enormous . Gillette 's driver had no choice on the narrow bridge but to hug the right rail so as to avoid a direct collision . The opposing car skidded in its turn , and the chauffeur , again with no alternative but head-on impact , accelerated instantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car 's skid . He managed the maneuver , and once over the planked entrance , hit the steep decline and slammed on his brakes . The LTD swerved to the left and descended sideways down the short , steep hill . Old Gillette was thrown bodily into the right window structure , crashing his head on the metal door frame with such force that the doctor said death was instantaneous . The second automobile sped over the bridge and left the scene . The chauffeur could give no description of it ; he 'd been blinded by the lights , and his concentration was on survival . The time of the accident was put at 9:55 . Andrew read the account in the Washington Post over breakfast in their suite . He read it several times , trying to find a false note , a variation not heard on the previous night 's newscasts . There was none . Except the drive to the Senate Office Building , the forgotten briefcase . His eyes kept pivoting on the estimated time of the tragedy : 9:55 . Twenty minutes after someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his hotel telephone . And why had it been done ? For what purpose ? It certainly was no guarantee that he would n't hear of the accident . He or Phyllis might have had the radio or the television set on ; they usually did , at least the radio . Why , then ? Why would anyone want him incommunicado from 9:35 to ? when did Madison get through ? 11:15 . Nearly two hours . Unless it was a mistake at the switchboard ; that was entirely possible . And he did n't believe it for a minute . " I still ca n't get over it , " said Phyllis , coming out of the bedroom . " It 's scary ! What are you going to do ? "  | " I do n't know . I suppose I should call Webster and tell him about our conversation . flow the old boy wanted me out . " " No ! Why should you ? " " Because it happened . Also , on another level , Gillette may have said something to the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spit . I 'd hate to find myself confirming a conversation like that without volunteering it first . " " I think you ought to wait . On both levels , thank you .... You do n't deserve being pilloried . I think that 's what someone called it . You believe you 're right ; you said so last night . " Trevayne drank his coffee , buying a few seconds of time before answering his wife . He wanted above all else to keep his suspicions from her . She accepted Gillette 's death as " scary " but nevertheless an accident ; there was no reason to think otherwise . He wanted to keep it that way . " Webster may agree with you ; so might the President . But to keep it straight , I want them to know . " The President of the United States did , indeed , agree with Phyllis Trevayne . He instructed Webster to tell Andrew to say nothing unless the matter came up from other quarters , and even then , to be vague about specific aspects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House . Webster also informed Trevayne that Ambassador Hill 's considered opinion was that the old Senator was merely testing him . Big Billy had known the cantankerous war horse for years ; it was a personal tactic . Hill doubted that Gillette would have reconvened the hearing . He simply would have let the candidate " stew , " and if Trevayne stuck to his guns , let the confirmation stand . It was a complicated rationalization . And Trevayne did n't believe it for a minute , either . Phyllis had promised herself a look at the NASA exhibition at the Smithsonian , and so , White House guard intact , she left Andrew at the hotel . The truth was that she realized he 'd be on the telephone constantly ; she knew he preferred being alone during such times . Trevayne showered and dressed and had a fourth cup of coffee . It was nearly ten-thirty , and he 'd promised to call Walter Madison before noon . He was n't sure what he was going to say to him . He would tell him about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the event the hearing was reopened . It had crossed his mind to mention it during their tense conversation eleven hours ago . But everything had been so confused , the attorney inexplicably so agitated , that he de- cided not to complicate the already complex state of things . I le recognized Madison 's semihysteria and thought he knew what brought it ' about : a terrible afternoon in the Senate chamber ; the return home to an ill wife  --  ill in the sense that he was n't there to help her stay sober ; and finally the bizarre account of the tragedy on a back-country Fairfax bridge . Even brilliant , sophisticated Manhattan lawyers had their thresholds of pressure . He 'd wait until noon before calling ; everyone 's head would be clearer then . There was a knock at the hotel door ; Trevayne looked again at his watch . It was probably maid service . He opened the door and was greeted by the polite , formal smile of an Army officer , a major in a creased uniform with gleaming brass and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ? " " Major Paul Bonner , Department of Defense . I suppose you 've been briefed ; nice to meet you . " The Major held out his hand , and Trevayne , by reflex , shook it . " No , Major , I have n't been briefed . " " Oh .... That 's a hell of a beginning . I 'm your man Friday ; at least until your office and staff are set up . " " Really ? Well , come on in . I was n't aware I was in business yet . " Bonner walked into the room with the assurance of a man used to command . He was , perhaps , in his late thirties or early forties , with close-cropped hair and the complexion of a man often outdoors . " You 're in business , all right . You want it ; I get it . . . . Whatever . Those are my orders . " He threw his hat on a chair and faced Trevayne with an infectious grin . " I understand you 're happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's here in Washington with you . So that rules out one area . . . . You 're rich as Croesus , so there 's nothing to be gained by offering you a boat ride on the Potomac ; you probably own the river . Also , you 've worked for State , so I ca n't intrigue you with D.C. gossip . You probably know more than 1 do . . . . So what 's left ? I drink ; I assume you do , too . You sail ; I try . I ski very well . You 're at best on the intermediate slope ; no sense in flying us to Gstaad . . . . So we find you a nice set of offices and start hiring . " " Major , you overwhelm me , " said Trevayne , closing the door and approaching the officer . " Good . I 'm on target . " " You sound as though you 'd read a biography I have n't written . "  | " You did n't ; ' Big Uncle ' wrote it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're high-priority material . " " Also , you sound as if you did n't approve ; am I correct about that , too ? " Bonner stopped smiling for the briefest of moments . " You may be , Mr. Trevayne . It would n't be fair for me to say it , though . I 've heard only one side of the story . " " I see . " Trevayne walked to the breakfast table and indicated the coffee . " Thanks . It 's too early for a drink . " " I 've got that too , if you like . " " Coffee 's fine . " Trevayne poured a cup , and Bonner crossed to the table and took it . No sugar , no cream . " Why the come-on-strong , Major ? " " Nothing personal . I resented the assignment , that 's all . " " Why ? Not that I know what your assignment is ; I still do n't understand . Is there some combat situation somewhere that you 're missing ? " " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. " " Sorry . . . again . " " You 're blowing it , that 's for sure ; whatever it is . " " Sorry . For a third time . " Bonner took his coffee and sat down in an armchair . " Mr. Trevayne , two days ago I was given your file and told that I was assigned to you . I was also told that you were a V.I.P. of the first water , and whatever I could do for you  --  whatever had no latitude or longitude , just whatever  --  I was to make sure you got it ... . Then yesterday the word came through . You 're out to nail us , hands and feet , with big , fat spikes . I 'm a lousy go-between in this kind of a situation . " " I 'm not out to nail anybody . " " Then my job 's easier . I admit you do n't look like a nut . Or sound like one , either . " " Thank you . I 'm not entirely sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more relaxed than before . " Sorry . For a fourth time , or is it the fifth ? " " I lost count . " " Actually , I rehearsed that little speech . I wanted to give you a chance to complain ; I 'd be taken off . " " It 's still possible . What 's this ' nailing people ' supposed to mean ? "  | " In short words , you 're one of the virulent antimilitary . You do n't like the way the Pentagon operates ; incidentally , neither does the Pentagon . You think Defense spends zillions more than it has to ; so does Defense . And you 're going to spell it all out with a subcommittee , and our heads will roll . Is that fairly accurate , Mr. Trevayne ? " " Perhaps . Except , as with most such generalizations , you imply questionable accusations . " Trevayne stopped for a moment , remembering that the dead Gillette had said pretty much the same thing to him in the car last night . He finished the Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think they 're justified . " " If that 's so , then I 'm relieved . We 'll ? " " Major , " interrupted Trevayne quietly , " I do n't give a damn whether you 're relieved or not . If you 're going to stay on , we 'd better have that clear . Okay ? " Paul Bonner took an envelope from his tunic . He opened it and removed three typewritten pages , handing them to Trevayne . The first was a listing of available government offices ; it read like a real-estate prospectus . The second was a Xerox copy of the names Andrew had given Frank Baldwin almost two weeks ago  --  before the terrible events at the Plaza . They were the names of those men and women Andy wanted on his staff ; the major positions . There were eleven : four lawyers , three accountants , two engineers  --  one military , one civilian  --  and two secretaries . Of the eleven , five had enigmatic checks beside their names . The third page was again a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of each was a one-word description of his or her employment classification and the previous government position held . Trevayne looked over at Major Bonner . " What the hell is this ? " " Which ? " Andrew help up the last page . " This list here . I do n't know any of these people . " " They 've all been cleared for high-intermediate-level security employment . " " That 's what I thought . And I assume these checks ... " Trevayne held up the second page , his list . " They mean these people have n't been cleared ? " " No . As a matter of fact , they have . " " And six have n't ? " " That 's right . " Andrew removed the first two pages and placed them on the coffee  | table . Ile took the last page and carefully folded it , then proceeded to tear the fold iii half . He held out the torn paper for Bonner . The Major reluctantly approached and took it . " Your first job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to you . I 'll hire my own staff . Get those pretty little checks inked in for those other six people . " Bonner started to speak and then hesitated as Trevayne picked up the pages from the coffee table and sat down on the couch . Finally Bonner took a long breath and addressed the civilian . " Look , Mr. Trevayne , nobody cares who you hire , but they 've got to submit to security checks . This substitution list just makes it easier , quicker . " " I ' 11 bet it does , " mumbled Trevayne , marking off addresses on the office sheet . " I 'll try not to employ anyone in the pay of the Presidium . . . . This suite at the Potomac Towers ; is n't that an apartment building ? " " Yes . Government lease has fourteen months to run . It was rented last year for an engineering project , and then the funds were cut ... . It 's out of the way , though . It might be inconvenient . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or New York Avenue . You 'll probably be seeing a lot of people . " " I 'll pay for the taxis . " " I had n't thought of it that way . I just assumed they 'd be calling on you . " " Very good , Major . " Trevayne rose from the chair and looked at the officer . " There 're five places I 've checked off . Look them over and tell me what you think . " He crossed to Bonner and handed him the page . " I 've some phone calls to make ; I 'll use the bedroom . Then we 'll get going . Have some more coffee . " Trevayne went into the bedroom and closed the door . There was no sense in waiting any longer to call Madison . He 'd have no place to make the call other than a government office or a pay phone . It was quarter to eleven ; Madison should be routined and calm by now . " Andy , I 'm still shook up , " said the attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible . " " I think I should tell you the rest . That 's pretty terrible , too . " He did , and Walter Madison was , as Trevayne expected , stunned . " Did Gillette give you any indication that he 'd spoken to the others ? " " No . I gathered he had n't . He said he was going to call a reopening in the morning . "  | " He might have gotten too much resistance for that .... Andy , do you think the accident was anything else ? " " I keep wondering , but I ca n't come up with a reason that makes sense . If it was n't an accident and he was killed because he was going to reopen the hearing  --  that means they , whoever they are , if they are , want me to chair the subcommittee . I can understand someone wanting me out ; I ca n't understand anyone wanting to make sure I 'm in . " " And I ca n't buy the theory that these extremes would be used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . Certainly not killing . As I gathered from the reports , that is n't feasible anyway . His car could n't have gone into the water ; the rail was too high . It could n't have been forced into a roll ; it simply slid sideways and threw the old man into the frame . . . . It was an accident , Andy . Simply terrible , but an accident . " " I think it has to be . " " Have you spoken to anyone about this ? " Trevayne was about to tell Madison the truth , that he 'd been in touch with Webster at the White House . Instead , he hesitated . Not for any reason related to Walter 's confidence , only because he felt an obligation to the President . To mention Webster would mean involving the President of the United States  --  the office , if not the man . " No . No , I have n't . Just to Phyllis , that 's all . " " We may want to change that , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll phone around and let you know . " " Who are you going to call ? " For several seconds Walter Madison said nothing , and both men recognized the awkwardness of the moment . " I do n't know yet . I have n't had time to think . Perhaps a couple of the men at the hearing , the ones I met . Easy enough to do ; I 'm solicitous , my client wants to know if he should make a statement . Anything .... I 'll get the drift . " " Right . You 'll call me back ? " " Of course . " " Make it late in the day . I 've got my own major from the Defense Department . He 's going to help me set up shop . " " Christ ! They do n't waste a minute . What 's his name ? " " Bonner . First name , Paul , I think he said . " Madison laughed . It was a laugh of recognition , and not entirely pleasant . " Paul Bonner ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't understand . What 's so funny ? " " Bonner 's one of the Pentagon 's Young Turks . The original bad boy of Southeast Asia . Remember a few years ago ? A half-dozen or so  | officers got thrown out of Indochina for some highly questionable activities beyond the borders , behind the lines ? " " Yes , I do . The inquiry was squashed . " " You know it . It was too damned hot . This Bonner was in command . " BY TWO O'CLOCK Trevayne and Bonner had scouted three of the live office suites . The Army liaison tried to maintain a neutral attitude , but he was too candid . Trevayne realized that in several ways Bonner was like himself ; at close range , it was difficult for the officer to disguise his opinion . It was obvious that Bonner felt all the locations they 'd seen were satisfactory . He could n't understand why Trevayne insisted on visiting the last two , both quite far from the central city . Why not pick one of the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first three out of courtesy , so it would n't appear that he was subject to snap decisions . Bonner had allowed that the offices at the Potomac Towers did look out on the river ; Trevayne had suspected as much , and that fact , in itself , was enough to convince him . His offices would be at the Potomac Towers . But he would find other reasons than the river , the water . He would n't give Major Paul Bonner , the Young Turk of the Pentagon , the opportunity of saying that his V.I.P. had a thing about water . He would n't lend himself to the ridicule that might so easily come from the blunt observations of a man whose actions had frightened the Department of the Army a few short years ago . " There 's nothing against our taking a lunch break , is there , Major ? " " Christ , no . I 'll get my ass chewed if it does n't appear on my chit sheet . As a matter of fact , I 'll get reamed anyway for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd have someone else do it for you . "  | " Who , for instance . " " Hell , I do n't know . Do n't you people always have other people do these things ? Get offices and stuff like that ? " " Sometimes . But not if it 's a concentrated job that 's going to require a lot of time on the premises . " " I forgot . You 're a self-made millionaire , according to the reading material . " " Only because it was easier , Major . " They went to the Chesapeake House , and Trevayne was at first amused , then amazed , at Bonner 's alcoholic capacity . The Major ordered double bourbons  --  three before lunch , two during , and one after . And they were generous singles to begin with . Yet Bonner did not display the slightest indication of having had a drink . Over coffee , Trevayne thought he 'd try a more friendly approach than he 'd shown throughout the morning . " You know , Bonner , I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thankless chore . I can see why you resent it . " " I do n't mind , really . Not now . Actually , I pictured you as some kind of computerized . . . prick , if you 'll forgive the expression . You know , a mincing slide-rule type who made his bread and thinks everyone else is worthless . " " Did the reading material ' indicate that ? " " Yeah . I think it did . Remind me to show it to you in a couple of months . . . . If we 're still speaking . " Bonner laughed and drank the remainder of his bourbon . " It 's crazy , but they did n't have any photographs of you . They never do with civilians , except in security cases . Is n't that nuts ? In the field I 'd never look at a file unless there were at least three or four photographs . Not just one ; I 'd never accept just one . " Trevayne thought for a moment . The major was right . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . " I read about your . . . field activity . You made a large impression . " " That 's off-limits , I 'm afraid . I wo n't talk about that , which means I 'm not supposed to admit 1 was ever west of San Diego . " " Which strikes me as silly . " " Me , too . . . . So I 've got a couple of programmed statements which do n't mean a damn thing . Why bring them up ? " Trevayne looked at Bonner and saw that he was sincere . He did n't want to restate the programmed replies he 'd been fed ; yet there seemed to be something else he was perfectly willing to discuss . Andrew was n't sure , but it was worth a try .  | " I 'd like a brandy . How about you ' ? " " Stick to bourbon . " " A double ? " " That 's right . " The drinks came and were half-finished before Trevayne 's observation proved out . " What 's this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so uptight ? " " You said it this morning , Major . Defense is spending zillions ' more than it should . " " I understand that ; nobody would argue . But why are we the heavies right off the top ? There are thousands involved . Why are we singled out as the prime targets ? " " Because you issue contracts . Simple as that . " " We issue contracts that congressional committees approve . " " I do n't want to generalize , but it seems to me that Congress usually approves one figure and then is forced to approve another  --  the second being a lot higher than the first . " " We 're not responsible for the economy . " Trevayne lifted his half-empty brandy glass and revolved it . " Would you accept that kind of reasoning in the field , Major ? I 'm sure you 'd accept the fact that your intelligence teams had a margin for error , but would you tolerate a hundred-percent inaccuracy ? " " It 's not the same . " " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to equate lives with money . " " I find that argument specious ; you had no such consideration when your field activity ' cost a great many lives . " " Horseshit ! That was a statistical-combat situation . " " Double horseshit . There were an awful lot of people who thought the situation was totally uncalled for . " " Then why the hell did n't they do something about it ? Do n't cry plow . " " As I recall , they tried , " said Trevayne , staring at his glass . " And failed . Because they did n't read their problem correctly . Their strategy was very un-pro . " " That 's an interesting statement , Major .... Provocative , too . " " Look , I happen to think that particular war was necessary for all the reasons brighter men than me have stated time and again . I can also understand how a lot of those reasons could be rejected , traded off because of the price . That 's what those people did n't concentrate on . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inc . " Trevayne finished his brandy . " How could ... those people have done that ? " " Visual-tactical maneuvers . I could even break down the logistics of cost and geography . " " Please do , " said Trevayne , returning the Major 's smile . " The visual : fifteen thousand coffins in three units of five thousand each . The real things  --  government issue , pine construction . Cost , two hundred dollars per item on bulk purchase . Geography : New York , Chicago , Los Angeles  --  Fifth Avenue , Michigan Avenue , Sunset Boulevard . Tactic : placing the coffins laterally at one-foot spacings , with every hundredth casket open and displaying a corpse . Mutilated , if possible . Personnel requirements : two men per coffin , with a side task force of one thousand per city employed to distract police or to prevent interference . Total troop requirements : thirty-three thousand . . . and a hundred and fifty corpses . . . . Three cities completely immobilized . Two miles of corpses , real and symbolic , blocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's incredible . And you think it would have worked ? " " Have you ever seen civilians standing around on a street corner watching a hearse go by ? It 's the ultimate identification . . . . What I just described would have turned the stomachs of eight to ten million people on the scenes , and another hundred million through the media . A mass burial rite . " " It could n't have been done . It would have been prevented . There 's the police , national guard ... " " Logistics , again , Mr. Trevayne . Diversionary tactics ; surprise , silence . The quiet grouping of personnel and equipment , say , on a Sunday morning or early Monday  --  minimum-police-activity hours . The execution of the maneuver so precisely timed that it could be accomplished in less than forty-five minutes in each city . . . . Only thirty-odd thousand men  --  women , too , probably . You had damn near a halfmillion in the Washington march alone . " " It 's chilling . " Trevayne was not smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " you " for the first time . Trevayne 's position had been clear on Indochina , and the soldier wanted him to know he knew it . " That 's the point . " " Not only the maneuver , but that you could conceive of it . " " I 'm a professional soldier . It 's my job to conceive strategies . And once having conceived them , also to create countermeasures . " " You 've created one for this ? "  | " Definitely . It 's not very pleasant , but unavoidable . It 's reduced to swift retaliation ; immediate and complete suppression . Confrontation by force and superior weaponry so to establish military supremacy . Suspension of all news media . Replace one idea with another . Fast . " " And spill a considerable amount of blood . " " Unavoidable . " Bonner looked up and grinned . " It 's only a game , Mr. Trevayne . " " I 'd rather not play . " Bonner looked at his watch . " Gosh ! It 's almost four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses , or they 'll be locked up . " Trevayne got out of his chair just a little bit numbed . Major Paul Bonner had spent the last few minutes telling him something . Spelling out the harsh reality that Washington was inhabited by many Paul Bontiers . Men who were committed  --  rightfully , justifiably , by their lights  --  - to the promulgation of their authority and influence . Professional soldiers who were capable of outthinking their opponents because they were equally capable of thinking for them . Generous , too ; tolerant of the hazy , muddled thinking of their soft civilian counterparts . Secure in the knowledge that in this era of potential holocaust there was no room for the indecisive or undecided . The protection of the nation was directly related to the enormity and effectiveness of its strike force . For such men as Bonner it was inconceivable that any should stand in the way of this goal . That they could not tolerate . And it seemed incongruous that Major Bonner could say so ingenuously : Gosh ! It 's almost four o'clock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own reason for being selected , unrelated to the view of the river . Bonner accepted it . The other suites all had the normal five offices and a waiting room ; the Towers included an additional kitchenette and a study . The latter was designed for quiet reading or conferences , even overnight accommodations by way of a huge leather couch in the main office . The Potomac Towers had been leased for an engineering crash program and outfitted to accommodate the pressurized schedule . It was ideal for Trevayne 's purposes , and Bonner made the requisition , relieved that the tour was finished . The two men returned to Trevayne 's hotel . " Would you care to come up for a drink ? " asked Trevayne , getting out of the Army vehicle with the insignia on both doors that allowed for parking just about anywhere . " Thanks , but I 'd better report in . There are probably a dozen generals walking in and out of the men 's room , watching my office ,  | waiting for me . " Bonner 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the image he 'd just created . Trevayne understood . The Young Turk enjoyed the position he was in  --  a position undoubtedly assigned for reasons Bonner did n't like , and now , perhaps , could be turned on his superiors . Trevayne wondered what those reasons were . " Well , have fun . Ten in the morning ? " " Right on . I 'll alert security ; that list of yours will be cleared . If there are any real problems , I 'll call you myself . You 'll want others , though . I 'll set up interviews . " Bonner looked at Andrew and laughed . " Your interviews , massa . " " Fine . And thanks . " Trevayne watched the Army car start up and enter the congested flow of Washington 's five-thirty traffic . The hotel desk informed Trevayne that Mrs. Trevayne had picked up their messages at precisely five-ten . The elevator operator tipped three fingers to his visor and said , " Good evening , " addressing him by name . The first guard , seated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , smiled ; the second guard , standing in the corridor several yards from his door , nodded his head in recognition . Trevayne had the feeling that he 'd just passed through a hall of mirrors , his image reflected a thousandfold , but not necessarily for him . For the benefit of others . " Hello , Phyl ? " Trevayne closed the door and heard his wife speaking on the telephone in the bedroom . " Be with you in a sec , " she called out . He took off his jacket , unloosened his tie , and went to the bar , where he poured himself a glass of ice water . Phyllis came out of the bedroom , and Trevayne saw a trace of concern in her eyes , beyond the smile . " Who was that ? " " Lillian . " She referred to their housekeeper , cook , aide-for-allseasons at High Barnegat . " She had some electrical trouble ; it 'll be all right . The repairmen said they 'd be out soon . " They kissed their customary kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean , trouble ? " " Half the lights went out . The north side . She would n't have known except for the radio ; it went off . " " Did n't it go right back on again ? " " I guess not . It 's all right , the men are coming . " " Phyl , we have an auxiliary generator . It cuts in when a circuit breaker fails . "  | " Darling , you do n't expect us to know about those things . The men'II fix it . . . . How did everything go ? Where did you go , incidentally ? " It was possible , Trevayne supposed , for there to be an electrical malfunction at Barnegat , but unlikely . Barnegat 's entire electrical system was designed by Phyllis ' brother ; a labor of love and enormous sophistication . He 'd call his brother-in-law later ; ask him , jokingly perhaps , to check into it . " Where did I go ? . . . all over town with a nice young fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who ? " " The science of ... military supremacy will do . " " That must have been rewarding . " " Enlightening ' would be more accurate . . . . We settled on the offices . Guess what ? They 're on the river . " " How did you manage that ? " " I did n't . They were just available . " " You have n't heard anything , then ? About the hearing , the con-firmation ? " " Nope . At least , not so far . The desk said you stopped for the messages . Did Walter call ? " " Oh , they 're on the table . Sorry . I saw Lillian 's and forgot . " Trevayne went to the coffee table and picked up the notes . There were an even dozen , mostly friends , a few quite close , others vaguely remembered . There was no message from Madison . But there was one from a " Mr. de Spadante . " " That 's funny . A call here from De Spadante . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Met him on the plane . He goes back to early New Haven . He 's in construction . " " And probably wants to take you to lunch . After all , you 're a bulletin . " " I think , under the circumstances , I wo n't return the call . . . . Oh , the Jansens phoned . We have n't seen them in almost two years . " " They 're nice . Let 's suggest dinner tomorrow or Saturday , if they 're free . " " Okay . I 'm going to shower and change . If Walter calls and I 'm in the john , get me , will you , please ? " " Sure . " Phyllis absently took the remainder of her husband 's ice water from the bar and drank it . She walked to the couch and sat down , reaching for the messages . Several names were completely unfamiliar  | to her ; business friends of Andy 's , she presumed . The rest only peripherally recognizable , except for the Jansens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington cronies from the State Department days . She heard the shower running and considered the fact that she , too , would have to dress when Andy was finished . They 'd accepted a dinner invitation over in Arlington  --  a duty call , as Andy termed it . The husband was an attache at the French embassy , a man who years ago had helped him during the conferences in Czechoslovakia . The Washington carousel had begun , she reflected . God , how she hated it ! The telephone rang , and for a second Phyllis hoped it was Walter Madison and that he had to meet with Andy , thus canceling the Arlington dinner . No , she thought further ; that would be worse . Quickly called meetings were always terrible in Washington . " Hello ? " " Mr. Andrew Trevayne , if you 'd be so kind . " The voice was a touch raspy , but soft , polite . " I 'm sorry , he 's in the shower . Who 's calling , please ? " " Is this Mrs. Trevayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the pleasure ; my name is De Spadante . Mario de Spadante . I 've known your husband , not well , of course , for a number of years . We met again yesterday , on the plane . " Phyllis remembered that Andy had said he would n't return De Spadante 's call . " Then I 'm doubly sorry . He 's way behind schedule , Mr. de Spadante . I 'm not sure he 'll be able to call you back right away . " " Perhaps I 'll leave a number anyway , if it 's not too much trouble . He may want to reach me . You see , Mrs. Trevayne , I was to be at the Devereaux 's over in Arlington , too . I 've done some work for Air France . Your husband might prefer that I find an excuse and not be there . " " Why in heaven 's name would he do that ? " " I read in the papers about his subcommittee . . . . Tell him , please , that since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is knows he drove into town with me . " " What does he mean , he was followed ? Why does your driving into town with him have any bearing on anything ? " Phyllis spoke to her husband as he came out of the bathroom .  | " It should n't  --  my driving in with him ; he offered me a lift . If he says he was followed , he 's probably right . And used to it . He 's supposed to be in the rackets . " " At Air France ? " Trevayne laughed . " No . He 's a builder . He 's probably involved with air-terminal construction . Where 's the number ? " " I wrote it on the blotter . I 'll get it . " " Never mind . " Trevayne , in undershirt and shorts , walked into the living room to the white desk with the green hotel blotter . He picked up the telephone and slowly dialed as he deciphered his wife 's hastily scribbled numbers . " Is this a nine or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " A seven ; there was no nine . . . . What are you going to say ? " " Straighten him out . I do n't give a damn if he rents the rooms next door . Or takes pictures of me on May Day . . . . I do n't play those games , and he 's got a hell of a nerve thinking I do .... Mr. de Spadante , please . " Trevayne calmly but with obvious irritation informed De Spadante of his feelings and suffered through the Italian 's obsequious apologies . The conversation lasted a little over two minutes , and when Trevayne hung up he had the distinct feeling that Mario de Spadante had enjoyed their dialogue . Which was precisely the case . Two miles away from Trevayne 's hotel , in the Northwest section of Washington , De Spadante 's dark-blue Cadillac was parked in front of an old Victorian house . The house , as the street  --  the area itself ? had seen better , more affluent times . Yet there was a grandeur ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the declining values . The inhabitants of this particular section fell into roughly three categories : the dying elders whose memories or lack of money prevented their moving away ; the youngish couples  --  usually **34;1265;TOOLONG  --  who could lease a fair amount of space for comparatively little rent ; and finally  --  in sociological conflict  --  a scattering of subculture youth enclaves , groups of young nomads wandering into sanctuaries . The wail of Far Eastern sitars , the hollow vibrations of Hindu woodwinds continued long into the morning ; for there was no day or night , only gray darkness and the moans of very personal survival . Hard drugs . The suppliers and the supplied . The old Victorian house beyond De Spadante 's Cadillac was re- cently taken over by a cousin , another cousin whose influence was felt in Washington 's Police Department . The house was a substation in the subculture , a minor command post for narcotics distribution . De Spadante had stopped off with some colleagues to inspect the real-estate investment . He sat in a room with no windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covering the cracks . Except for one other person , he was alone . He replaced the telephone in its cradle and leaned back in his chair behind a filthy table . " He 's edgy ; he just told me off . That 's good . " " It would have been better if you goddamn fools had let things take their course ! That hearing would have been reconvened and the confirmation withdrawn . Trevayne would have been out ! " " You do n't think ; that 's your problem . You look for quick solutions ; that 's very dumb . It 's especially dumb right now . " " You 're wrong , Mario ! " said Robert Webster , spitting out the words , the muscles in his neck tense . " You did n't solve anything , you only gave us a potentially dangerous complication . And a crude one ! " " Do n't talk to me crude ! I laid out two hundred thousand up in Greenwich ; another five for the Plaza ! " " Also crude , " blistered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactics damn near exploded in our faces ! You watch your step . " The Italian leaped out of the chair . " Do n't you tell me , Webster ! One of these days you pricks will kiss my ass for what I got on him ! " " For God 's sake , lower your voice . And do n't use my name . The biggest mistake we ever made was getting mixed up with you ! Allen 's right about that . They all are ! " " I did n't ask for any engraved invitation , Bobby . And you did n't get my name out of no telephone book . You came to me , baby ! You needed help , and I gave it to you .... I 've been helping you for a long time now . So do n't talk to me like that . " Webster 's expression betrayed his reluctant acceptance of De Spadante 's words . The mafioso had been helpful , helpful in ways few others dared to be . And he , Bobby Webster , had called upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since come and gone when Mario de Spadante could be so easily dismissed . It reduced itself to controlling him . " Do n't you understand ? We wanted Trevayne out . A reconvened hearing would have accomplished that . " " You think so ? Well , you 're wrong , Mr. Lace Pants . I talked to  | Madison last night ; I told him to call me from the airport before he hoarded . I figured someone ought to know what Trevayne was doing . " The unexpected information caused Webster to check his hostility , replace it with a concern he had n't anticipated . " What did Madison say ? " " That 's different , huh ? None of you smart asses thought of it , huh ? " " What did he say ? " De Spadante sat down again . " The esteemed attorney was very uptight . He sounded like he was going to head home and climb into a bottle with that lush wife of his . " " What did he say ? " " Trevayne figured that panel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded dice ; he made that clear . And Madison made no hones that he sweated out the confirmation  --  not Trevayne , he did n't sweat piss  --  Madison sweated . For a very goddamn good reason . Trevayne told him if those bastards turned him down he was n't leaving town quietly . He was going to call in the newspapers , television ; he had a lot of things he wanted to say . Madison did n't guess any of it was too good . " " About what ? " " Madison does n't know . He only knows it 's very heavy . Trevayne said it would rip the city apart ; those were the words . Rip the city apart . " Robert Webster turned away from the mafioso ; he breathed deeply to control his ire . The sour-sweet odor that permeated the old house was offensive . " It makes absolutely no sense . I 've talked with him every day this past week . It does n't make sense . " " Madison did n't lie , either . " Webster turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is it ? " " We 'll find out , " answered the Italian with quiet confidence . " Without having our asses in a sling over some press conference . And when you girls put it all together , you 'll see I was right . If that hearing was reconvened and Trevayne thrown out , he would have shot off his cannon . I know Trevayne , from way back . He does n't lie , either . None of us are ready for that ; the old man had to die . " Webster stared at the heavyset man sitting so arrogantly in the filthy chair . " But we do n't know what it was he was going to say . Has it crossed your Neanderthal mind that it might have been something as simple as the Plaza Hotel ? We could have  --  and would have immediately  --  disassociated ourselves from anything like that . "  | Dc Spadante did n't look up at the White House aide . Instead he reached into his pocket , and while Webster watched apprehensively , with a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortoiseshell glasses . He put them on and began scanning some papers . " You try too hard to get me pissed off , Bobby . . . . Might have , " could have ' ; what the hell is that ? The fact is , we did n't know . And we were n't going to risk finding out on the seven-o'clock news . I think maybe you ought to go back to the lace parade , Bobby . They 're probably sewing up a storm . " Webster shook his head , dismissing De Spadante 's invective as he walked to the shabby door . Hand on the broken glass doorknob , he turned to look once again at the Italian . " Mario , for your own good , do n't make any more unilateral decisions . Consult us . These are complicated times . " " You 're a bright boy , Bobby , but you 're still very young , very green . You get older , things do n't seem so complicated . . . . Sheep do n't survive in the desert ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Trevayne , he 's in the wrong environment . It 's as simple as that . " THE RAMBLING white house , with the four Ionic pillars supporting an impractical balcony above the front porch , was situated in the middle of a landscaped three-acre plot . The driveway was as impractical as the balcony ; it bordered the right side of a weedless , carpetlike front lawn and veered  --  inexplicably  --  again to the right , ending in a half-circle away from the house . The real-estate agent told Phyllis that the original owner had planned a garage apartment at the end of the semicircle , but before he could build it , he was transferred to Muscaton , South Dakota . It was no High Barnegat , but it had a name  --  a name Phyllis wished she could obliterate . It was in raised lettering in the white stone beneath the impractical balcony . Monticellino . Since the year 's lease did not entitle her to sandblast the letters ,  | Phyllis decided the name would remain between God , the original owner , and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Greenwich , although there were similarities . It was rich , ninety-eight percent white , and catered to the upward-mobility syndrome ; it was essentially imitative  --  of itself ? and insular ; it was inhabited by people who knew exactly what they were buying : the penultimate rewards of the corporate dream . The ultimate  --  when admitted  --  was southeast : McLean or Fairfax , in the Virginia hunt country . What the people who were buying the penultimate rewards did n't know , thought Phyllis , was that they were also getting , without additional charge , all of the unbearable problems that went with their purchases . Phyllis Trevayne had had them . Those problems . Five years ' worth ; nearer six , really . Six years in a half-hell . It was no one 's fault . And everyone 's . It was the way things were . Someone once decreed that a day should have twenty-four hours  --  not thirty-seven or fortynine or sixteen  --  and that was that . It was too short . Or too long . Depending . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts about time . The first exhilaration of love , the excitement , the unbelievable energies the three of them  --  Andy , Douglas , herself  --  put into the shabby warehouse they called a company ; if there were any thoughts of time then , it was usually in the form of where-the-hell-didit-go . She did triple duty . She was the secretary so needed to keep Andy organized ; she was the bookkeeper filling ledger after ledger with unpronounceable words and unbelievably complicated figures . And finally she was the wife . Their marriage had been comfortably situated  --  as her brother phrased it  --  between a Pratt and Whitney contract and an upcoming presentation to Lockheed . Andy and Doug had agreed that a threeweek honeymoon in the Northwest would be ideal . The couple could sec the San Francisco lights , catch some late skiing in Washington or Vancouver , and Andrew could make a side trip to Genessee Industries in Palo Alto . Genessee was an enormous conglomerate  --  everything from trains to aircraft , prefabricated housing to electronics research . She knew when they began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw the outlines of what was coming . It was the day after they got hack from Vancouver . She had walked into the office and met the middle-aged woman  | her brother had hired to till in during her absence . A woman who somehow exuded a sense of purpose , who seemed so committed to accomplishing far more than eight hours would permit  --  before dashing home to husband and children . A delightful person without the slightest trace of competitiveness about her , only a profound gratitude at being permitted to work . She did n't actually need the money . Phyllis would think of her often during the coming years . And understand . Steven came ; Andrew was ecstatic . Pamela arrived , and Andrew was the cliched , bumbling father filled with love and awkwardness . When he had the time . For Andrew was also consumed with impatience ; Pace-Trevayne was growing rapidly  --  too rapidly , she felt . There were suddenly awesome responsibilities accompanied by astronomical financing . She was n't convinced her young husband could handle it all . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but adaptable to the changing pressures , the widening pressures . When he was unsure or frightened  --  and he was often both  --  he simply stopped and made everyone else stop with him . He told her that his fear and uncertainty were the results of not understanding , not knowing . It was better to lose a contract ? painful as it might be  --  than to regret the acceptance later . Andrew never forgot the courtroom in Boston . That would n't happen to him . Her husband was growing ; his product filled a void that desperately needed filling , and he instinctively parried in point-counterpoint until he was assured of the advantage . A fair advantage ; that was important to Andy . Not necessarily moral , just important , thought Phyllis . But she was n't growing ; the children were . They talked , they walked , they filled uncountable pails of diapers and spewed out unmeasurable amounts of cereal and bananas and milk . She loved them with enormous joy and faced their beginning years with the happiness of the new experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first , as with so many others . She understood that , too . The schoolday was the initial shock . Pleasant to begin with  --  the abrupt cessation of the high-pitched , demanding voices . The silence , the peace ; the wonderful first aloneness . Alone except for the maid , the laundry man , an occasional repairman . Essentially alone , however . The few really close friends she 'd known had moved away  --  with husbands or with dreams of their own having little to do with the New Haven  --  Hartford environs . The neighbors in their upper-middle-class suburb were pleasant enough for an hour or two , but no more . They  | had their own drives  --  company drives ; East Haven was the territory for them . And there was something else about the East Haven wives . They resented Phyllis Trevayne 's lack of need and appreciation for their corporate strivings . That resentment  --  as resentment so often does  --  led to a form of quiet , progressive isolation . She was n't one of them . And she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust into a strange , uncomfortable limbo . The thousands of hours , hundreds of weeks , scores of months that she 'd devoted to Andrew , Doug , and the company had been replaced by the all-day , everyday needs of her children . Her husband was more often away than at home ; it was necessary , she understood that , too . But the combination of all things left her without a functioning world of her own . So there was the first , free-of-cares , purposeful venturing out on a regular , daily basis ; unencumbered by infant concerns . No patient explanations to impatient maids , no elaborate preparations for noontime , snacktime , playtime , friendtime . The children were in private schools . They were picked up at eight-thirty in the morning and returned conveniently at four-thirty , just prior to the rush-hour traffic . The " eight-hour parole " was the term used by the other young , white , rich mothers of the white , rich youngsters attending the old , white , rich private schools . She tried relating to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Country ; Andrew enthusiastically endorsed them but rarely set foot on the premises . They palled on her as rapidly as the members did , but she refused to admit the disenchantment . She began to believe the fault was hers , the inadequacy hers . Was there guilt ? Then that was hers also . What in God 's name did she want ? She asked that question of herself and found no answer . She tried returning to the company  --  no longer a warehouse , now a sprawling complex of modern buildings , one of several branches . Pace-Trevayne was running at high speed on a very fast track in an extraordinarily complicated race . It was n't comfortable for the wife of the energetic young president to be seated at a desk doing uncomplicated chores . She left , and she thought Andrew breathed easier . Whatever it was she sought eluded her , but there was relief to be found , starting at lunch . In the beginning it was a delicate glass of Harvey 's Bristol Cream . Then graduation to the single Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her degree was awarded by the switch to vodka  --  the no-telltale , very viable substitute . Oh , God ! She understood Ellen Madison ! Poor , bewildered , rich ,  | soft , pampered Ellen  --  hushed-up Ellen Madison . Never , never phone her after six p.m. ! She recalled with painful clarity the late rainy afternoon Andy found her . She 'd been in an accident , not serious , but frightening ; her car had skidded on the wet pavement into a tree about a hundred yards from the driveway . She 'd been hurrying home from a very long lunch . She 'd been incoherent . In her panic she 'd raced from the smashed car to the house , locked the front door , and run to her room , locking that also . A hysterical neighbor ran over , and Phyllis ' maid called the office . Andrew convinced her to unlock their bedroom door , and with five words her life was changed , the awful years terminated . " For God 's sake , help me ! " " Mother ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new bedroom that opened on the impractical balcony . Phyllis Trevayne had nearly finished unpacking ; it had been an early photograph of her children that had triggered her silent reminiscing . " There 's a special delivery letter from the University of Bridgeport for you . Are you lecturing this fall ? " Pam 's transistor radio filled the downstairs . Phyllis and Andy had laughed when they met their daughter at Dulles Airport the night before ; Pam 's radio was turned on before she reached the passenger gate . " Only biweekly seminars , dear . Bring it up , will you , please ? " The University of Bridgeport . The coincidence of the letter and her thoughts was appropriate , she considered . For the letter from such a place as Bridgeport was a net result of her " solution , " as she called it . Andy had realized that her drinking had become more than a social habit but had refused to accept it as a problem . He had more problems than he needed ; he attributed her excess to the temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't uncommon ; he 'd heard other men speak of it . " Cooped up " was the phrase usually accompanying their rationalizations . It would pass . Further , he 'd proved it to himself . For whenever they took vacations or were traveling with each other , there was no problem at all . But that rainy afternoon they both knew there was a problem and they had to face it together . The solution had been Andy 's , although he let her think it was hers . It was to immerse herself completely in some project with a speci- tic objective in view . A project in which she found a great deal of pleasure ; an objective ambitious enough to make the time and energy worthwhile . It did n't take her long to find the project ; the fascination had been there since she was first introduced to medieval and Renaissance history . It was the chronicles : Daniel , Holinshed , Froissart , Villani . An incredible , mystical , marvelous world of legend and reality , fact and fantasy . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Yale  --  she found herself as impatient as Andrew was with the expanding concerns of Pace-Trevayne . She was appalled by the dry academic approach to these vivid , full-bodied histories . She was infuriated with the musty , cobwebbed , overly cautious literateness given these  --  herpoetic novelist-historians of the ages . She vowed to open the rust-caked doors and let the fresh air of new appreciation circulate among the ancient archives . She thought in terms of contemporary-parallels  --  but with the splendor of past pageantry . If Andrew had his fever , she caught one , too . And the more she immersed herself , the more she found everything else falling into organized place . The Trevayne household was a busy , energetic home again . In less than two years Phyllis had her master 's degree . Two and a half years later , the once-described objective  --  now merely an accepted necessity  --  was reached . She was formally conferred a Doctor of English Literature . Andrew threw a huge party celebrating the event and in the quiet love of the aftermath told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved it . " You 're almost finished , " said Pamela Trevayne , coming through the bedroom door . She handed her mother the red-stamped envelope and looked around . " You know , Mom , I do n't resent the speed you get things straightened up in , but it does n't have to be so organized , too . " The more she immersed herself , the more she found everything falling into organized place . " I 've had lots of experience , Pam , " said Phyllis , her mind still on her previous thoughts . " It was n't always so . . . tidy . " " What ? " " Nothing . I said I 've done a lot of unpacking . " Phyllis looked at her daughter as she rather absently thumbed open the back of the envelope . Pam was growing so tall ; the light-brown hair fell loose , framing the sharp young features , the wide brown eyes that were so  | alive . So eager . Pam 's face was a good face  --  a very feminine version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more , much deeper , than pretty . Pam was emerging as a most attractive adult . And beneath the surface exuberance there was a fine intelligence , a questioning mind impatient with unsatisfactory answers . Whatever the hang-ups of her immediate growth period  --  boys , transistor radios turned these days to mournful , back-country folk ballads , pop posters , poor marches , and Boone 's Apple Farm  --  Pam Trevayne was part of the vast " now . " And that was fine for everybody , thought Phyllis as she watched her daughter part the curtains over the door of the impractical balcony . " This is a crazy porch , Mother . With luck you could get a whole folding chair out there . " Phyllis laughed as she read the letter from Bridgeport . " I do n't think we 'll use it for dinner parties . . . . Oh , Lord , they 've got me scheduled for Fridays . I asked them not to . " " The seminars ? " asked Pam , turning from the curtains . " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they assign me Fridays . I want Friday open for weekends . " " That 's not very dedicated , Madame Professor . " " One dedicated member of the family is enough right now . Your dad 's going to need the weekends  --  if he can take them off . I 'll phone them later . " " Today 's Saturday , Mom . " " You 're right . Monday , then . " " When 's Steve getting here ? " " Your father asked him to take the train up to Greenwich and drive the station wagon down . He has a list of things to bring ; Lillian said she 'd pack the wagon . " Pam uttered a short cry of disappointment . " Why did n't you tell me ? I could have taken the bus home and drive down with him . " " Because I need you here . Dad 's been living in a half-furnished house with no food and no help while I 've been at Barnegat . We womenfolk have to put things to rights . " Phyllis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the bureau mirror . " I 'm against your approach . In principle . " Pam smiled . " Womenfolk are emancipated . " " Be against , be emancipated ; and also go unpack the dishes . The movers put them in the kitchen  --  the oblong box . " Pam walked to the edge of the bed and sat down , tracing an imaginary crease on her Levi 's . " Sure , in a minute . . . . Mom , why  | did n't you bring down Lillian ? I mean , it would be so much easier . Or hire someone ? " " Perhaps later . We 're not sure what our schedule will be . We 'll he in Connecticut a lot , especially weekends ; we do n't want to close the house . . . . I did n't realize you were so maid-conscious . " Phyllis gave her daughter a raised eyebrow of mock disapproval . " Oh , sure . I get uptight when I ca n't find my ladies-in-waiting . " " Then why ask ? " Phyllis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daughter in the mirror . " I read the article in the Sunday Times . It said that Dad had taken on a job that would keep him busy for ten years  --  with no time off  --  and then it would only be half-done ; that even his well-known abilities were up against the impossible . " " Not impossible ; they used the word incredible . ' And the Times is prone to exaggerate . " " They said you were a leading authority on the Middle Ages . " " They do n't always exaggerate . " Phyllis laughed again and lifted an empty suitcase off a chair . " What is it , dear ? You 've got that Iwant-to-say-something look . " Pam leaned back against the headboard ; Phyllis was relieved to see that her daughter did not have shoes on . The bedspread was silk . " Not say . ' Ask . ' I 've read the newspaper stories , the stuff in the magazines ; I even saw that TV news thing of Eric Sevareid 's  --  they called it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's grooved these days . ... Why is Dad taking this on ? Everyone says it 's such a mess . " " Precisely because it is a mess . Your father 's a talented man . A lot of people think he can do something about it . " She carried the suitcase to the doorway . " But he ca n't , Mom . " Phyllis looked over at her daughter . She 'd been only half-listening , parent-child listening , more concerned with the thousand and one things that needed to get done . " What ? " " He ca n't do anything . " Phyllis walked slowly back to the foot of the bed . " Would you mind explaining that ? " " He ca n't change things . No committee , no government hearing or investigation , can make things any different . " " Why not ? " " Because the government 's investigating itself . It 's like an embezzler being made the bank examiner . No way , Mom . " " That remark sounds suspiciously out of character , Pam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it says it . We talk a lot , you know . " " I 'm sure you do , and that 's good . But I think that kind of statement oversimplifies , to say the least . Since there 's a general agreement that a mess exists , what 's your solution ? If you 've arrived at a criticism , you must have an alternative . " Pam Trevayne sat forward , her elbows on her knees . " That 's what everyone always says , but we 're not sure it 's so . If you know someone 's sick , but you 're not a doctor , you should n't try to operate . " " Out of character ... " " No , that 's mine . " " I apologize . " " There is an alternative . But it 'll probably have to wait ; if we 're not too far gone or dead by then . . . . A whole big change . Top to bottom , a huge replacement . Maybe a real third party ... " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a freak-out ; that 's the violent-jocks . They 're no better than what we 've got ; they 're dumb . They split heads and think they 're solving something . " " I 'm relieved  --  I 'm not condescending , dear . I mean that , " said Phyllis , reacting to her daughter 's sudden questioning look . " You see , Mom , the people who make all the decisions have to be replaced with people who 'll make other decisions . Who 'll listen to the real problems and stop making up fake ones or exaggerating the little ones for their own benefit . " " Maybe your father can point out . . . things like that . If he backs them up with facts , they 'll have to listen . " " Oh , sure . They 'll listen . And nod ; and say he 's sure a great guy . Then there 'll be other committees to look into his committee , and then a committee to look into them . That 's the way it 'll be ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing changes . Do n't you see , Mom ? The people up there have to change first . " Phyllis watched her daughter 's excited expression . " That 's very cynical , " she said simply . " I guess it is . But I 've got an idea you and Dad do n't feel so differently . " " What ? " " Well , it seems to me everything 's kind of . . . impermanent . I mean , Lillian 's not here , this house is n't exactly the kind of place Dad digs ... " " There are good reasons for the house ; there are n't many available . And Dad hates hotels , you know that . " Phyllis spoke rapidly , off- handedly . She did n't care to spell out the fact that the small guest cottage in the back was ideally situated for the two Secret Service men assigned to them . The " 1600 Patrol " was the name she 'd read on a memorandum from Robert Webster . " You said the place was only half-furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... you 're still lecturing up in Bridgeport . " " I made the commitment ; it was near home . " " You even said you were n't sure of your schedule . " " Darling , you 're taking isolated , disconnected statements and making them support a preconceived judgment . " " Come on , Mother , you 're not building a case against somebody 's footnotes . " " I might as well be . I 've seen an awful lot just as misleading . And extraneous . . . . What your father 's doing is very important to him . He 's made some agonizing decisions ; they were n't easy , and they hurt . I do n't like to hear you imply that he 's not serious . Or part of a sham . " " Oh , wow ! I 'm sending out the wrong vibes . " Pam rose from the edge of the bed and stammered , embarrassed that she 'd so obviously upset her mother . " I 'm not saying that , Mom . I 'd never say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you level . " " Then I misunderstood you . " Phyllis walked aimlessly back to the bureau . She was annoyed with herself ; there was no reason to pick at Pam for saying what men  --  and women  --  far more knowledgeable than her daughter were saying all over Washington . Not the sham ; the aspect of futility . The waste . And Andrew hated waste . Nothing would change . That 's what they were saying . " I just meant that Dad maybe was n't sure , that 's all ... " " Of course , " said Phyllis turning , showing her daughter an understanding smile . " And you may be right . . . about the difficulty of changing things . But I think we ought to give him a crack at it , do n't you ? " The daughter , relieved by her mother 's smile , returned one of her own . " Gosh , yes . I mean , he might switch the whole Navy around , make it a sailing fleet . " " The ecologists would approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Steve arrives , he 'll be hungry . " " He 's always hungry . " Pam went to the door . " Speaking of your father , where is the elusive man ? He conveniently disappears when chores are in order . "  | " He 's out back . He was looking at that oversized doll house in the south forty . And that nutty driveway that looks like someone goofed with a cement mixer . " " Monticellino , ' dear , " " Mom , what does that mean ? " " Monticello got pregnant , I guess . " " Oh , wow ! " Trevayne closed the door on the small guest cottage , satisfied once again that the equipment for the 1600 Patrol had been properly installed and was functioning . There were two speakers that picked up any sound from the main-house hallway and living room as soon as a switch underneath the living-room rug was stepped on . He had done so , and he 'd just heard the front door open and a brief conversation between his daughter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a special delivery had arrived . Further , he 'd placed a book on the ledge of an open window in the downstairs rec room  --  so that it horizontally broke the vertical space  --  and noted , again with satisfaction , that a high , piercing hum was emanating from a third speaker beneath a numbered panel when he 'd entered the cottage . Every room in the main house had a number that corresponded with one on the panel . No object or person could cross a window space without activating the electronic scanner . He 'd asked the two Secret Service men to wait in their car up the street during the day while the children were down for the weekend . Andy suspected that they had additional materials in their automobiles that were somehow connected with the guest-cottage equipment , but he did n't inquire . He 'd find a way to tell the kids about the 1600 Patrol , but he did n't want them alarmed ; under no circumstances were they to learn of the reasons for the protection . The two agents had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sympathetic . His agreement with Robert Webster  --  with the President  --  was simple enough . His wife was to be given around-the-clock safety surveillance ; he learned that " safety surveillance " was the term , not " protection . " For some reason the former gave " wider latitude " and was more acceptable to the Justice Department . His two children were to receive " spot-check surveillance " on a daily basis provided by local authorities through federal request . The schools were to be informed of the " routine " exercise and asked to cooperate . It was agreed that Trevayne himself would be allocated the minimum " safety surveillance . " A personal assault against him was con- sidered unlikely , and he refused any formal association with Justice on the basis of conceivable conflict . Bobby Webster told him the President had laughed when informed that he objected to the " wider-latitude " phrase employed by the Justice Department . A previous Attorney General named Mitchell had left his mark indelibly on such manipulative language . Trevayne heard the sound of a horn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , had gone partially beyond the entrance and was now in reverse , preparing to turn into the driveway . The back was filled practically to the roof , and Andy wondered how Steve could use the rear-view mirror . The boy drove to the front path and accurately judged the parallel positioning of the tailgate so the unloading would be made easier . He climbed out of the front seat , and Andy realized  --  somewhat ruefully , but with amusement  --  that his son 's long hair was now shaped almost biblically . " Hi , Dad , " said Steve , smiling , his shirt overlapping his flared trousers , his shoulders equal in height to the roof of the station wagon . " How 's the nemesis of the incredible ? " " The who of the what ? " asked Andy , shaking his son 's hand . " That 's what the Times said . " " They exaggerate . " The house was " organized " ? far more than Andy thought possible by late afternoon . He and his son had unloaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaiting the next command from Phyllis , who had them shuffle furniture as though it were chess pieces . Steve announced that the hourly charges of the new moving company of Trevayne and Trevayne were going up rapidly , with double wages every time a heavy piece was moved back into a previous position . At one point he whistled loudly and stated with equal fervor that it was a union break for a can of beer . His father , who had been relegated to vice-president by a unanimous vote of one , thought his shop steward a cunning negotiator . The beer break came between one couch and two armchairs  --  all out of place . For them to get back in position , the can of beer was a small additional price . By five-thirty Phyllis was as satisfied as she 'd be , the movers ' cartons and sisal removed to the back of the house , the kitchen in order ; and Pam came downstairs announcing that the beds were made  --  her brother 's in a way she hoped he 'd appreciate .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a plant , " was Steve 's only comment . The original owner of Monticellino  --  or , as he was referred to without much affection , him  --  had installed one desirable appliance in the kitchen : a char-broil grate . The collective decision was reached for Andrew to drive into Tawning Spring , find a butcher shop , and come back with the largest sirloin steak he could buy . Trevayne thought it was a fine idea ; he 'd stop and chat with the 1600 Patrol on the way . He did so . And not to his surprise but to his liking , he saw beneath the dashboard of the government automobile , the largest , most complicated assortment of radio dials he could imagine in one vehicle outside of a spacecraft . That was fine , too . The original owner 's char-broil grate had one disadvantage : it smoked up most of the downstairs . As this required multiple windows to be opened , Trevayne remembered the rug switch to the guest-house panel , stepped on it , and loudly  --  if inexplicably to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiasco . " You know , Mom , " said Steven Trevayne , watching his father open and close the front door , fanning the not currently overpowering smoke , " I think you 'd better get him back on a sailboat . Dry land does something to his lobotomy . " " I think you 'd better feed him , Mother , " added Pam . " What did you say ? He 's been here for three weeks with no food . " Trevayne saw his wife and children laughing and realized the apparent ridiculousness of his actions , vocal and physical . " Be quiet or I 'll cancel your subscriptions to Child Life . " The outsized steak was good , but no more than that . Several other decisions were made concerning the butcher shop and his charbroil grate . Pam and Phyllis brought on the coffee as Steve and Andy carried off the remaining dishes . " I wonder how Lillian 's doing ? " asked Pam . " Up there all by herself . " " That 's the way she likes it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his coffee . " Anyway , she can tell off the gardening service . She says Mom 's too easy with them . " " I 'm not easy or hard . I rarely see them . " " Lillian thinks you should look . Remember ? " Steve turned to his sister . " She told us when we drove her into town last month that she did n't like the way they kept changing the crews . There was too much time wasted explaining , and the rock gardens were always loused up . She 's a regular Louis the Fourteenth . "  | Andrew suddenly but unobtrusively looked up at his son . It was a small thing , if anything , but it caught his attention . Why had the gardening service changed personnel ? It was a family business , and as the family was Italian and large , there was never any dearth of employees . At one time or another they 'd all worked the grounds of Barnegat . He 'd look into the gardening service ; he 'd make some inquiries into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lillian 's protective , " he said , backing off the subject . " We should be grateful . " " We are . Continuously , " replied Phyllis . " How 's your committee coming , Dad ? " Steve added some coffee to his heavy cream . " Subcommittee , not committee ; the difference is significant only in Washington . We 've got most of the staff together now . The offices are in shape . Incidentally , very few beer breaks . " " Unenlightened management , probably . " " Positively . " Andy nodded . " When do you start blasting ? " asked the son . " Blasting ? Where did you pick up that word ? " " Saturday morning cartoons , " interjected Pam . " Your father means relative to him , " said Phyllis , watching her husband 's concerned look . " Well , are n't you going to out-Nader the raiders ? " Steve smiled without much humor . " Our functions are different . " " Oh ? How so , Dad ? " " Ralph Nader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in specific contractual obligations pertaining to government agreements . There 's a big difference . " " Same people , " said the son . " Not necessarily . " " Mostly , " added the daughter . " Not really . " " You 're qualifying . " Steve drank from his cup , his eyes on his father . " That means you 're not sure . " " He probably has n't had the time to find out , Steve , " said Phyllis . " I do n't think that 's qualifying ' anything . " " Of course it is , Phyl . A legitimate qualification . We 're not sure . And whether they 're the same people Nader 's gone after or different people , that 's not the issue . We 're dealing in specific abuses . " " It 's all part of the larger picture , " said Sieve . " The vested interests . "  | " Now , hold it a minute . " Trevayne poured himself more coffee . " I 'm not sure of your definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Okay ? " " Okay . " " Heavy financing has brought about a lot of decent things . Medical research , I 'd put first ; then advanced technology in agriculture , construction , transportation . The results of these heavily financed projects help everyone . Health , food , shelter ; vested interests can make enormous contributions . Is n't that valid ? " " Of course . When making contributions has something to do with it . And not just a by-product of making money . " " Your argument 's with the profit motive , then ? " " Partially , yes . " " It 's proved pretty viable . Especially when compared to other systems . The competition 's built in ; that makes more things available to more people . " " Do n't mistake me , " said the son . " No one 's against the profit motive as such , Dad . Just when it becomes the only motive . " " I understand that , " Andrew said . He knew he felt it deeply himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't believe I can ? " " I want to believe you . It 's nice to read what reporters and people like that say about you . It 's a good feeling , you know ? " " Then what prevents you ? " asked Phyllis . " I do n't know , exactly . I guess I 'd feel better if Dad was angry . Or angrier , maybe . " Andrew and Phyllis exchanged glances . Phyllis spoke quickly . " Anger 's not a solution , darling . It 's a state of mind . " " It 's not very constructive , Steve , " added Trevayne lamely . " But , Jesus ! It 's a starting point , Dad . I mean , you can do something . That 's heavy ; that 's a real opportunity . But you 'll blow it if you 're hung up on specific abuses . ' " " Why ? Those are actual starting points . " " No , they 're not ! They 're the sort of things that clog up the drains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , you 're drowning in a sewer . You 're up to your neck ? " " It 's not necessary to complete the analogy , " interrupted Phyllis . " ... in a thousand extraneous facts that high-powered law firms delay in the courts . " " I think , if I understand you , " said Andrew , " you 're advocating a  | spiked broom . That kind of cure could be worse than the disease . It 's dangerous .. ' " Okay . Maybe it 's a little far out . " Steven Trevayne smiled earnestly , without affection . " But take it from the guardians of tomorrow . ' We 're getting impatient , Dad . " Trevayne stood in his bathrobe in front of the miniature French door that opened on the impractical balcony . It was one o'clock in the morning ; he and Phyllis had watched an old movie on the bedroom television set . It was a bad habit they 'd gotten into . But it was fun ; the old films were sedatives in their way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . " Nothing . I just saw the car go by ; Webster 's men . " " Are n't they going to use the cottage ? " " I told them it was all right . They hedged . They said they 'd probably wait a day or so . " " Probably do n't want to upset the children . It 's one thing telling them that routine precautions are taken for subcommittee chairmen ; it 's quite another to see strangers prowling around . " " I guess so . Steve was pretty outspoken , was n't he ? " " Well . . . " Phyllis fluffed her pillow and frowned before answering . " I do n't think you should put too much emphasis on what he said . He 's young . He 's like his friends : they generalize . They ca n't  --  or wo n't  --  accept the complications . They prefer spiked brooms . ' " " And in a few years they 'll be able to use them . " " They wo n't want to then . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what this whole thing 's all about . . . . There goes the car again . "  | IT WAS NEARLY six-thirty ; the rest of the staff had left over an hour ago . Trevayne stood behind his desk , his right foot carelessly on the seat of his chair , his elbow resting on his knee . Around the desk , looking at the large charts scattered over the top , were the subcommittee 's key personnel , four men reluctantly " cleared " by Paul Bonner 's superiors at Defense . Directly in front of Trevayne was a young lawyer named Sam Vicarson . Andrew had run across the energetic , outspoken attorney during a grant hearing at the Danforth Foundation . Vicarson had represented  --  vigorously  --  the cause of a discredited Harlem arts organization reapplying for aid . The funds , by all logic , should have been denied , but Vicarson 's imaginative apologies for the organization 's past errors was so convincing that Danforth resubsidized . So Trevayne had made inquiries about Sam Vicarson , learned that he was part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , " lucrative employment during the daytime with ghetto " storefront " work at night . He was bright , quick , and incredibly resourceful . On Vicarson 's right , bending over the desk , was Alan Martin , until six weeks ago the comptroller of Pace-Trevayne 's New Haven plants . Martin was a thoughtful , middle-aged former stats analyst ; a cautious man , excellent with details and firm in his convictions , once they were arrived at . He was Jewish and given to the quiet humor of ironies he 'd heard since childhood . On Vicarson 's left , curling smoke out of a very large-bowled pipe , stood Michael Ryan , who , along with the man next to him , was an engineer . Both Ryan and John Larch were specialists in their fields ? respectively aeronautical and construction engineering . Ryan was in his late thirties , florid , convivial , and quick to laugh but deadly serious  | when faced with an aircraft blueprint . Larch was contemplative , sullen in appearance , thin-featured , and always seemingly tired . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , each of these four minds worked constantly , at very high speeds . These men were the nucleus of the subcommittee ; if any were equal to the Defense Commission 's objectives they were . " All right , " said Trevayne . " We 've checked and rechecked these . " He gestured wearily at the charts . " You 've each had your part in compiling them ; all of you studied them individually , without the benefit of one another 's comments . Now , let 's spell it out . " " The moment of truth , Andrew ? " Alan Martin stood up . " Death in the late afternoon ? " " Bullshit . " Michael Ryan took the pipe out of his mouth and smiled . " All over the arena . " " I think we ought to bind these and offer them to the highest bidder , " said Sam Vicarson . " I could develop a penchant for the good life in Argentina . " " You 'd end up in the Tierra del Fuego , Sam . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Who wants to begin ? " asked Trevayne . A quartet of statements was the reply . Each voice assertive , each expecting to dominate the others . Alan Martin , by holding up the palm of his hand , prevailed . " From my point of view , there are holes in all the replies so far . But since the audits generally concern projects with subcontracting fluctuations , it 's expected . Subsequent staff interviews are generally satisfactory . With one exception . In all cases of any real magnitude , bottom-line figures have been given . I.T.T . was reluctant , but they came over . Again , one exception . " " Okay , hold it there , Alan . Mike and John . You worked sep-arately ? " " We cross-checked , " said Ryan . " There was  --  and is  --  a lot of duplication ; as with Alan , it 's in the subcontracting areas . Ticking off : Lockheed and I.T.T . have been cooperative down the line . I.T.T . presses computer buttons , and out shoot the cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They should , " interrupted Sam Vicarson . " They 're using my money . " " They told me to thank you , " said Alan Martin . " GM and Ling-Tempco have problems , " continued Ryan . " But to be fair about it , it 's not so much evasion as it is just plain tracing who 's  | responsible for what . One of our interviewers spent a whole day at General Motors  --  in the turbine engineering offices  --  talking to a guy who was trying to locate a unit design head . Turned out it was himself . " " There are also the usual corporation tremors , " added John Larch . " Especially at GM ; conformity and inquiry are n't happy bedfellows . " " Still , we generally get what we want . Litton is crazy . Smart-likea-fox crazy . They finance ; that puts them one to ten places removed from any practical application . I 'm going to buy stock in those boys . Then we come to the big enigma . " " We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair and picked up his cigarette . " How about you , Sam ? " Vicarson mocked a bow to Andrew . " I 'd like to take this opportunity to thank the gods for bringing me in contact with so many prestigious law firms . My modest head is swimming . " " Translated , " said Alan Martin , " he stole their books . " " Or the silver , " said Ryan between puffs on his pipe . " Neither . I have , however , juggled many offers of employment ... . here 's no point in recapping what 's come in on a relatively satisfactory basis . I disagree with Mike ; I think there 's been a hell of a lot of evasion . I agree with John ; corporation tremors  --  or delirium tremens are everywhere . But with enough perseverance , you get the answers ; at least enough to satisfy . With all but one . . . . It 's Alan 's exception ' and Mike 's enigma . ' For me it 's a legal jigsaw never covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Trevayne , sitting down . " Genessee Industries . " " That 's where it 's at , " replied Sam . " Genessee . " " Leopards and spots and nothing changes . " Andrew crushed out his hardly smoked cigarette . " What 's that mean ? " asked Larch . " Years ago , " answered Trevayne , " twenty , to be exact , Genessee waltzed Doug Pace and me around for months . One presentation after another . I 'd just gotten married ; Phyl and I traveled out to Palo Alto to ' t hem . We gave them everything they wanted . So well , they threw us out and used variations on our designs and went into production for themselves. , , " Nice people , " said Vicarson . " Could n't you get them for patent theft ? " " Nope . They 're better than that and you ca n't patent Bernoulli 's i nn ' plc . I hey made the variation in the metallurgical tolerances. "  | " Indigenous and unprovable . " Michael Ryan tapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dozen different states , proving grounds in twice as many . They could predate mockups with authenticated affidavits , and the courts would n't know what the hell was going on . They 'd win . " " Exactly , " agreed Andrew . " But that 's another story , another time . We 've got enough to think about . Where are we ? What do we do ? " " Let me try to put it together . " Alan Martin picked up the cardboard chart marked " Genessee Industries . " Each chart was twentyfour inches by twenty-four ; there were outlined boxes with headings above subdivisions . Underneath and to the right of every title was inserted  --  stapled  --  typewritten data pertaining to the areas of contractual commitment , engineering and construction , financial operations , and legal entanglements  --  usually concerning the financial operations . There were scores of index markings that referred the reader to this or that file . " The advantage of the financial picture is that it pervades all areas . . . . During the past weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the companies got them . As you all know , they were coded , just like advertising coupons in newspapers . The codes gave us mailing times and locations . We then followed up with staff interviews . We found that with Genessee there was an abnormal amount of shifting . Answers we assumed would be sent from logically designated departments and locations were transferred to others  --  not so logical . Executive personnel our staff went out to interview routinely were suddenly no longer in their positions . Genessee had sent them to other divisions , subsidiaries ; hundreds , even thousands of miles away . Some to overseas branches . . . . We began setting up conferences with union leadership . Same story , only less subtle . The word went out across the country  --  from one coast to the other  --  no local discussions . The nationals were deciding what to do about government interference . In short words , Genessee Industries has been engaged in a very efficient and massive cover-up . " " Not completely efficient , obviously , " said Trevayne quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin . " Remember , Genessee has over two hundred thousand employees , multimilliondollar contracts every fifteen minutes  --  under one name or another ? and real estate rivaling the Department of the Interior . As long as those questionnaires kept coming back , and with Gencssee 's diversification , the shuffling might easily go unnoticed . " " Not with you , you financial raccoon . " Vicaison sat on the arm  | of an easy chair and reached over , taking the Genessee chart from Martin . " I did n't say they were that good . " " What struck me , " continued Sam , " and it probably was n't so great a shock to Mike and John , or even Al here , was the sheer size of Genessee . Its subsidiary structure is goddamned unbelievable . Sure , we 've all heard Genessee this and Genessee that for years , but it never really impressed me before . Like those one-page ads you see in magazines  --  institutional things ; you figure , okay , it 's a company . That 's nice ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's got more names than a telephone book . " " And no antitrust action , " said Andrew . Gesco , Genucraft , SeeCon , Pal-Co , Cal-Gen , See Cal . . . So help me , it 's double crostics ! " Sam Vicarson tapped his finger on the Genessee chart 's " Subsidiary " heading . " What bothers me is that I 'm beginning to think there are dozens more we have n't traced . " " Let them be , " said John Larch with a pained expression on his thin face . " We 've got enough to work with . " MAJOR PAUL Bonner parked in an empty space on the river side of lie Potomac Towers lot . He stared out the windshield at the water , growing sluggish with the progressing fall season . It had been seven weeks to the day since he 'd first driven into that parking area ; seven weeks since he 'd first met Andrew Trevayne . He had begun the liaison position with resentment  --  against both the man and the job . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it difficult to sustain any real dislike of the man . Not that he approved of Trevayne 's goddamn subcommittee ; he did n't . It was all horseshit . Scattershot horseshit conceived by the pols on the Hill for the sole purpose of shifting  --  or at least diluting  --  the responsihility for that which was necessary . That 's what made Major Paul Bonner so hostile ; no one could dispute the necessity  --  no one !  | Yet everyone gave the appearance of shocked disbelief when dealing with acknowledged reality . Time was the enemy . Not people . Could n't they see that ? Had n't they learned that in the space program ? Certainly Apollo 14 cost twenty million when it was launched in February of seventy-one . If , instead , it had been scheduled for seventy-two , it would have cost ten ; six months later , probably five to seven and a half . Time was the ultimate factor in the goddamn civilian economics , and since they , the military , had to reckon with time , they also had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks he 'd tried to impress Andy Trevayne with his theory . But Trevayne only acknowledged it to be a factor , not the factor . Trevayne insisted that Bonner 's theory was simplistic , then roared with laughter when Bonner reacted explosively to the term . Even the Major had smiled ? " simplistic " was no less a code name for " idiocy " than his use of " civilian . " Checkmate . But Trevayne did allow that if one eliminated time , a degree of corruption could be dispensed with ; if there was all the time in the world , one could sit back and wait for reasonable prices . He agreed to that . But it was only one aspect , he insisted . Trevayne knew the marketplace . Corruption went much further than the purchase of time . And Bonner knew he was right . Checkmate . The fundamental difference between the two men was the importance each gave to the time factor , however . For Bonner it was paramount ; for Trevayne it was n't . The civilian held to the judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global holocaust . The Major did not . He 'd seen the enemy , fought him , witnessed the fanaticism that propelled him . It filtered down from austere halls in national capitals through field commanders to battalions ; from battalions down into the ranks of the half-uniformed , sometimes halfstarved troops . And it was powerful . Bonner was not so simplistic , he felt , as to reduce the enemy to a political label ; he 'd made that clear to Andy . The enemy was n't a Communist , or a Marxist , or a Maoist or a Lumumbaist . Those were merely convenient titles . The enemy was three-fifths of the earth emerging from ignorance and thrust forward by the idea of revolution ; the idea of finally  --  after centuries  --  possessing its own identity . And once possessing it , forcing its imprimatur on the rest of the world .  | No matter the reasons , even the justifications ; no matter the rationalizations , filled with motivational theories and diplomatic convolutions . The enemy was people . A few in control of millions upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and technology , were subject to human weakness and their own fanatical commitments . The rest of the world had to be prepared to deal decisively , emphatically , overpoweringly with this enemy . Paul Bonner did n't give a damn what it was called . That it was , was enough . And that meant time . Time had to be bought , no matter the price or the petty manipulations of the suppliers . He got out of the Army car and started to walk slowly across the tarred surface toward the entrance of the apartment-office complex . He was in no hurry , no hurry whatsoever . If it were possible , he 'd prefer not being there at all . Not today . For today was the start of his real assignment , what he 'd been primed for , maneuvered into . Today was when he was to begin bringing back concrete information to his superiors at Defense . He 'd known it all along , of course . He realized at the beginning that he had n't been selected as Trevayne 's liaison because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of work . He knew , further , that the constant but innocuous questioning he 'd received to date was only a lead-in to what had to follow . His superiors were n't really interested in such mundane matters as : How are things going ? Are the offices satisfactory ? Is the staff up to snuff ? Is Trevayne a nice fellow ? . . . No , the colonels and the brigadiers had other things on their minds . Bonner stopped by the steps and looked up . Three Phantom 40 's , their jetstreams sharply defined in white against the blue sky , streaked vest at an enormous altitude . There was no sound , only the barely visible outlines of three tiny triangles gracefully , like miniature silver arrowheads , piercing the air corridors of the horizon . Strike force  --  bomb and rocket tonnage capable of obliterating five battalions ; flight maneuverability  --  complete mastery of dynamics from ground zero to seventy thousand feet ; speed  --  Mach three . " I hat 's what it was all about . But he wished it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the morning , a brief three hours ago . He 'd been sitting in his office trying to make sense out of some Light-colonel 's  | appraisal of new installations at Benning . It was nonsense , the summation more concerned with the officer 's egotistical evaluation of his own observations than with the equipment . The request had been for eightypercent replacement ; said request a put-down of the previous officer in charge . It was an Army game played by second-raters . As Bonner had scribbled his negative recommendation across the bottom of the page , his intercom rang . He was ordered to report immediately to the fifth floor ? " Brasswares , " as all below the rank of colonel called it  --  to Brigadier General Cooper . Lester Cooper , a whitehaired , tough , facile-tongued exponent of the Pentagon 's requirements . An ex-commandant of West Point whose father had held the same position . A man of and for the Army . The Brigadier had spelled it out . Not just what he was to do , but without using the specific words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most military strategies , it was simple  --  simplistic ? ? and to the point . Paul Bonner , for the sake of military necessity , was to be an informer . In the event any impropriety was charged , he was expendable . But the Army would take care of him . As it had taken care of him once before in Southeast Asia ; protected him once before and showed him its gratitude . It was all a question of priorities ; the Brigadier had made that clear . Ordered it to be clear . " You must understand , Major . We support this Trevayne 's efforts . The Joint Chiefs have requested that we cooperate in every way , and we have . But we ca n't allow him to cripple vital production . You of all people should see that . . . . Now , you 're on a friendly basis with him . You 've ... " It was during the next five minutes that Brigadier General Cooper nearly lost his informer . He alluded to several get-togethers between Bonner and Trevayne that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the office . There was no reason to ; they were entirely social , in no way related to the Department of Defense . One had been a weekend he 'd spent with the Trevaynes in Connecticut at High Barnegat . Another was a small dinner party Bonner 's current mistress , a divorcee in McLean , had given for Andy and Phyllis . Still another , an afternoon of horseback riding and a fall barbeque in the Maryland hunt country . None was remotely connected with Trevayne 's subcommittee or Bonner 's liaison assignment ; none was paid for with government funds . The Major was annoyed . " General , why have I been under surveillance ? " " You have n't . Trevayne has . " " Is he aware of it ? "  | " He may be . He 's certainly aware of the rotating patrols from Treasury . White House orders . He takes damn good care of them . " " Do they act as surveillance ? " " Frankly , no . " " Why not . . . sir ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't wish to disagree with the General , but since I 'm delegated to . . . act very closely with Trevayne , I think I should be informed of such matters . It was my understanding that the guards were assigned by 1600 ' for precautionary measures . Since they 're in a maximum position for surveillance but they 're not being used  --  at least not by us ? and we assign additional personnel , it strikes me that we 're either duplicating or at cross-purposes . " " Which means you object to my reading off information you have n't given this office . " " Yes , sir . That information had nothing to do with this office . If there was surveillance , I should have been informed . I 've been placed in an unreasonably prejudiced position . " " You 're a hard-nose , Major . " " I doubt I 'd 've been given this job if I was n't . " The Brigadier got out of his chair and went to a long briefing table against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonner . " All right , I 'll accept cross-purposes . ' I wo n't pretend that we have a solid working relationship with everyone in this administration . Nor will 1 deny that there are a number of people surrounding the President whose judgments we find lacking . No , Major , we 're not about to let 1600 ' control our surveillance . . . or filter it . " " I understand that , General . I still think I should have been told . " " An oversight , Bonner . If it was anything else , my telling you now eliminates that , does n't it ? " The two officers stared at each other briefly . The understanding was complete  --  Bonner was at that moment accepted into the highest echelons of Defense . " Understood , General , " said Bonner quietly . The erect , white-haired Cooper turned back to the long table and opened a thick , plastic-bound notebook with huge metal rings . " Come here , Major . This is the book . And I mean the book , soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page : " GENESSEE INDUSFRIES . " Bonner entered the glass doors of the Potomac Towers and walked on the thick blue carpet toward the elevators . If he 'd timed everything  | right , if his telephone calls had resulted in the correct information , he 'd arrive at Trevayne 's office at least a half-hour before Trevayne himself returned . That was the plan ; over in the Senate Office Building , where Trevayne was in conference , others were also watching the clock . He was such a familiar sight in Trevayne 's suite of rooms that he was greeted now with complete informality . Bonner knew he was accepted by the small civilian staff because he seemed to be an anomaly . The professional soldier who possessed few of the unattractive military trappings ; whose outlook , even his conversation , seemed easygoing , with a continuous undercurrent of humor . When civilians found a man in uniform  --  especially the sort of overdressed uniform required daily at the Pentagon  --  who seemed to contradict the accepted manifestations of his profession , they warmed quickly . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all for him to wait in Trevayne 's inner office . He would take off his tunic , and stand in the doorway , and joke with Trevayne 's secretary . Then he might wander into one of the other rooms  --  his tie undone , his collar unbuttoned  --  and pass a few minutes with several of the staff . Men like Mike Ryan or John Larch . Perhaps the bright young attorney , Sam Vicarson . He 'd tell them a couple of stories  --  stories which ridiculed a pompous , well-advertised general or two . Finally , he 'd say he was going to stop bothering them and read the morning paper in Trevayne 's office . They 'd protest in good humor , of course , but he 'd smile and suggest a few drinks after work , perhaps . It would all take six or seven minutes . He would then return to Trevayne 's office , passing the secretary once again  --  this time complimenting her on her dress or her hair or whatever  --  and walk to the armchair by the window . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . Instead he would go to the file cabinet on the right wall and open it . He would select the drawer that held the G 's . Genessee Industries , Palo Alto , California . He would extract the folder , close the drawer , and return to the chair . He would have a safe maximum of fifteen minutes to make notes before replacing the information . The entire operation would take less than twenty-five minutes , and there would be only one moment of risk . If Trevayne 's secretary or a staff member walked in while the cabinet was open . In that event he would have to say he found it open and pass his actions off casually as " curiosity . " But of course the cabinet would never have been open ; it was always locked . Always .  | Major Paul Bonner would unlock it with a key given him by Brigadier General Lester Cooper . It was all a question of priorities ; and Bonner felt sick to his stomach . TREVAYNE rushed up the steps of the Capitol Building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew it , because he had made two out-of-the-way stops from his office to the center of town : at a bookstore on Rhode Island Avenue , where the traffic was slight , and a spur-of-the-moment detour to Georgetown , Ambassador Hill 's residence . The Ambassador was n't home . On Rhode Island Avenue he 'd noticed a gray Pontiac sedan maneuver into a parking space half a block behind him  --  heard the Pontiac 's rear tires scraping the curb . Twenty minutes later , as he had walked to the front door of Hill 's Georgetown house , he had heard the bells of a knife-sharpening truck , a small van driving slowly down the cobblestone street soliciting business from the uniformed maids . He had smiled , thinking the sight an anachronism , a throwback to his teen-age Boston memories . Then he saw it again ; there was the gray Pontiac . It was behind the slow-moving van , its driver obviously annoyed ; the street was narrow , and the small truck was not accommodating . The Pontiac was unable to pass . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a mental note to check with Webster at the White House . Perhaps Webster had assigned separate guards for him , although such precautions were unnecessary . Not that he was brave ; he was simply too well known a figure now , and he rarely traveled alone . This afternoon was an exception . He turned on the last step and looked down at the street . The gray Pontiac was n't in sight , but there were dozens of automobiles  --  some parked , with drivers inside , some moving slowly past . Any one of them might have been radioed from Georgetown.
