Back home , most adults do n't notice these kids . Gangling Dan Voll , 18 , is one of the stock boys at Pacemaker Foods in Rockford , Ill . Teresa Slowen works part time as a waitress in the Sundance Restaurant in Santa Fe , N. Mex . Curly-haired John Barker is the kid who cuts the grass in Birmingham , Mich . <P> But during this weekend in Williamsburg , Va. , these three-and 99 others , drawn two apiece from 50 states plus the District of Columbia-are absorbing the interest of adults , for they have been judged the brightest and best leaders of the nation 's 3.1 million high school seniors , class of 1979 . <P> " The splendor of this setting pales before the splendors your contributions probably will be . You are the citizens of tomorrow , the leaders of tomorrow . You are America 's future . " <P> - Greeting by Owen Kiernan , National Association of Secondary School Principals ( N.A.S.S.P. ) <P> These 102 well-scrubbed and polite high school seniors , bused from Washington 's National Airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses , triumphed over 350,000 classmates who entered this year 's N.A.S.S.P. scholarship competition , a program called Century III Leaders . They are student-government presidents , church youth leaders , honor-society members . They were judged on their knowledge of current events , school grades and written proposals for solving public problems . Each of them received a $1,500 scholarship plus the free trip to Williamsburg . At the end of this two-day conference , funded by the Shell Oil Company , one will be named a kind of super Century III Leader , and awarded a $10,000 scholarship . <P> As they get acquainted , their chatter is national TV talk-show modern ( " With those freeways in L.A. , man , nobody says how far anything is in miles , it 's just hours , you know " ) . The sophistication of kids from towns as small as Grey bull , Wyo. , is passing wondrous , but it is disconcerting too ; one wants something more than Johnny Carson from the leaders of tomorrow . <P> Saturday , 9:45 a.m . It develops that they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jeans or slacks , sneakers or penniless loafers , they exude information as they discuss conference topics : this morning it 's the Quality of Life , this afternoon Education , tomorrow Leadership and Community Involvement . Soft-spoken Ralph Shain of Bellaire , Texas : " If you want to talk about coal gasification , the Federal Government has n't yet licensed a single plant . " Dark-eyed Patti Anderson of Granby , Colo. : " The population of the underdeveloped countries will double in 20 years , but they 're not going to start having fewer children when three out of four die before reaching adulthood . " <P> When Discussion Leader Tom DiBacco of American University announces a refreshment break , the others ignore him ; they are busy drafting policy proposals at the corners of the room . DiBacco walks alone out to the foyer and picks up a Coke from the silver tureen . <P> " Students , do not switch rooms . You must wear your badges at all times . Possession of alcohol and drugs is prohibited . Anyone violating this rule will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Terry Giroux , director of N.A.S.S.P. 's office of student activities
