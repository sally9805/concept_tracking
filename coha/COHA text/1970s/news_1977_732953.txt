txt WASHINGTON  --  President Carter has rejected most of the spending cuts proposed by former President Ford a month ago , and this means that the fiscal 1978 deficit will soar close to $60 billion , sources said Monday . Carter 's decisions indicate that the $11 billion in cutbacks Ford planned for fiscal 1978 ? including trims in the foodstamp program , Social Security , and Medicare benefits  --  are dead . On the other hand , restoring the cuts will raise the deficit substantially from the $47 billion proposed by Ford , making it more difficult for Carter to reach his goal of balancing the budget in tour years . THE PRESIDENT will send ids version of the fiscal 1978 budget to Congress within a week . He has decided on an abbreviated document , basically amending the Ford budget in key areas . Carter addressed the deficit problem in a meeting with his Cabinet Monday , saying that the spending requests he has received from the departments call for substantial , increases , and " that 's something we just can not do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Education , and Welfare , and Patricia Harris of Housing and Urban Development ? complained that the Ford proposal would starve their agencies financially . It is in these departments where most of the restorations will be made . CALIFANO , FOR . example . said the Ford budget would force HEW to spend at a rate $4 billion less than the rate needed to maintain current services . Nevertheless , Carter said he would be tough in reviewing all the spending requests . " There 's only so much deficit we can accommodate , so I do n't want to get your hopes up too much , " he said . Carter worked on the budget during his weekend visit to Plains Ga. , but he said the final figures are n't set . He said Cabinet officers can still appeal to him and to Budget Director Bert Lance , but the deadline for appeals is Wednesday . Carter 's budget proposals are expected to be generally conservative , even though the Ford ideas have been cast aside . He is not expected to drop a batch of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WO N'T BE many new initiatives , " one said . And as the President surveyed the future , he said he 's going to continue to be tough on spending . Looking ahead to fiscal 1979 ( beginning Oct. 1 , 19781 , Carter said he intends to get going on planning for that budget by April . He warned Cabinet members : " If you want new programs added on , you 'll have to pretty well decide which programs you want to eliminate . " He reminded them that he did not make the promise lightly that he would balance the budget before his first term of office is over . The principal Carter established ? allowing new programs only if existing ones are cut back ? may be the source of future clashes with Congress . BOTH POLITICAL and economic reasons stand behind Carter 's reluctance to launch bold new spending programs now . First , he has tried to rebuild business confidence , and businessmen loathe big deficits . The fiscal 1977 deficit , for the year ending Sept. 30 , will reach close to $70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it now appears , it will mean back-toback red . ink of roughly $130 billion . That 's not much of a reduction in the deficit . Secondly , new spending programs commit large amounts of government money over the long haul , making it harder for Carter to reach his goal of balancing the budget .
