After 109 days , the miners reluctantly end their strike <P> Finally it was over . After 109 days , two abortive contract offers and untold expenditures of rancor , obstinacy and personal discomfort , rank-and-file members of the United Mine Workers voted late last week to end their strike . With union leaders promising that the 165,000 miners would return to their jobs on Monday and mine owners predicting that coal shipments would be back to normal within the week , the energy crisis that had been threatening-but never quite materializing-in a dozen Eastern Central states seemed to have passed . <P> As the miners began voting on the contract in the hollows and flatlands of coal country on Good Friday morning , few involved in the negotiations-coal operators , union officials and federal mediators-held out more than a fifty-fifty chance of approval . Indeed , as the first returns were announced by militant locals in western Pennsylvania and southern Illinois , it looked as if the miners were about to deal a thumping rejection to the pact , as they had done to a previous contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballots were tallied , they showed that the rank and file had approved the contract , 58,380 to 44,210 . U.M.W. President Arnold Miller reacted with a smile and a one-word comment to Secretary-Treasurer Willard Esselstyn : " Good . " To reporters , Miller acknowledged that the contract did not give the miners everything they wanted . But he called it " better than anything I ever worked under . " <P> The fact was that time had just about run out for the miners , and they knew it . If they had voted no , national bargaining between the U.M.W. and the 130-member Bituminous Coal Operators ' Association might have broken down completely . The coal companies and union locals would have begun negotiating on their own . Disillusioned miners thought that further negotiations at any level would not gain them a better contract , at least not one worth continuing the strike for . " It 's kind of like playing poker at this point , " said Cecil Roberts , 31 , a vice president of the U.M . W. 's District 17 in West Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a row . " <P> Warmer weather and increased production from non-U.M.W. mines had undercut the strike 's effectiveness . Moreover , the financial burden of the walkout was finally grinding down the stubborn miners and their families . " I 'm hurtin ' , " confessed Miner Johnny Elkins , 25 , of Hernshaw , W. Va. , who voted against the last contract offer . To make ends meet , he had been cutting and selling firewood for $35 a truckload . " Now spring 's coming , " said Elkins , " and people ai n't needing firewood . " So he traded in his chain saw for a secondhand trail bike and voted for the contract . Added Burl Holbrook , 35 , a miner in nearby Cabin Creek Hollow : " Principles are nice , but you ca n't buy food with them . "
