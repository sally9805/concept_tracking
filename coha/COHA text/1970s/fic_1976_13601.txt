A bundle of rags in the middle of the stage : two women huddled together at the gateway of Butyrki Prison , Moscow . On the streets , the Russian Revolution is taking place , but the sleeping women know nothing of this . The MOTHER lifts her head and speaks . MOTHER Get up now , girl . Go your way again . The streets are quiet , now . You can walk through them . Take your skirts away from mine . Pull your legs back under you . Gather yourself and go . You have been too mixed up with me all night . Your head lay in the dark cradle of my arms . Your hair wound round my hair until sad gray became bright black again and black became the gray it 's not yet been . Put on your shawl and leave me here . Gather yourself and go . GALINA I 've no place to run . Late last night my master turned me out .

GALINA And sweep , lay the fire and spin ! MOTHER Children , do you like them ? GALINA I could grow to care for them . MOTHER My son will be wanting a wife any time . Perhaps you will do for him . GALINA Is he handsome and strong ? MOTHER Broad shouldered and kind . The prison gates will open soon , you 'll see him with your own eyes . GALINA What was his crime ?

MOTHER The hearts of his jailors have softened . GALINA How did it happen ? MOTHER How does water change a stone ? Last night while you lay shivering in my arms I dreamt a new dream the first time in twelve years .

He is the revolution 's poet . Nestor Makhno 's with him . He is the revolution 's hope . p. 5 GALINA Her son 's a peasant lad . He is no braver than that . ELENA KELLER Nestor Makhno was a peasant , once . A slow , dull hulk drawn behind two oxen and a plow . MOTHER My lad plowed from well before the sun came up till well after the sun fell . But while the sun kept back the dark , light streamed in purple shadows down across his shining back . Then he seemed the golden lad he was ; his path shone equal to the sun 's .

ELENA KELLER I was Nestor 's light and he was mine . It was through an act of mine that Nestor changed . " I never understood before that actions could make us free , " he said , as he hid me in the well behind the barn . When he came to bring me bread the following day , his back was straight , his eyes were clear . " I shot the soldier who came to find the police chief 's murderer , " he said . " Come , " he lifted me onto a horse . " The blood of the oppressors on our hands is a more certain bond than any wedding pledge . " And so it was . I thought my death would be the consummation of my act , but found instead a keener life than I had lived .

She presses the large bunch of brightly colored flowers into his hand . He takes them , but can not speak . VOLINE Elena !  --  meeting us with flowers at the prison gates . . . . You 've been faithful all these years , but how else would you have been . . . ELENA KELLER Who is that man ? VOLINE A peasant lad , destroyed for hiding leaflets he could not read . He was kept near us for years . The three of us tapped out our plans in code on sewage pipes inside the prison walls . Day by day , his tapping made less sense . Often we would hear him cry out in the night the way a cornered fox cries at the hungry dogs , half in terror , half in joy that the long , lonely hunt is over and the merciful surrender finally begun .

I would have died for freedom once . I would have hung gaily , or faced a firing squad with pity . I would have let the chains rot my head from my neck rather than confess . This morning someone I 've never seen opens my cell and says freedom 's come and I must live for her . What does he know of freedom who never lay beneath the lash and felt the cool breeze blow soft across his back before the lash cut deep again . We who have learned freedom 's songs from the rattle of chains , what will we do with simple men 's dreams ? p. 7 ELENA KELLER stopping him : Nestor , please . For us , at last , the time is ripe . We have survived . Everywhere the people rise . We sowed the seeds of this great surging in the earth . We can not let the crop rot in the field for lack of strength .

GALINA That 's what we 'll do with freedom . We 'll be as trusting as that peasant mother . She loved her boy when he was young and strong ; she does n't love him less today because he 's less than she imagined he 'd become . Her dream of him was a cold , bloodless thing . His body 's warm , his heart beats out a rhythm that 's his own . When she holds him for a while she 'll think he has grown strong again . What we know is never strange and what we come to love is beautiful . NESTOR sees GALINA as if for the first time . He pulls away from ELENA and goes to GALINA with the flowers , and presses them into her hand . NESTOR MAKHNO Here , peasant girl , simple child .

ELENA and VOLINE are left standing alone and apart from the two couples , the MOTHER and her SON , the hero and his bride. p. 8 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO NESTOR MAKHNO , VOLINE and GALINA return to Gulai-Polye , in the Ukraine . They are met at a crossroads by people crawling towards them , crying for bread . THE PEOPLE approaching on their knees : Bread ! Bread ! Give us bread or shoot us . Bread ! The land is barren . It can not feed us . Our newborn drop from dry breasts . The Lord 's vengeance is hard upon us . Bread ! Give us bread or shoot us . The sight of the peasants ' miserable submissiveness angers MAKHNO . He rises to the occasion . NESTOR MAKHNO Stop crawling toward me like penitents . Here is one loaf . Should I divide it among you or should I eat it myself in front of you ? Hunger is easy to share . Food belongs to the one who takes it and who has teeth in his mouth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's messenger or the Tzar 's tax collector . I 'm Nestor Makhno . Son of the people , born son to a serf in Gulai-Polye . I know what you know , hunger , hard work , fear , but I 've been to the city . I spent nine years locked in a dungeon . Nine years below ground ; one endless winter . Never one spring or one summer to warm me or feed me . I lived through my death and was resurrected . Do you know who set me free ? Starving men stormed the prison gates . Men like you gave me sun again . Now we 'll free the land for them . Bread can be begged from the priests by the women but freedom and land must be taken . Stand up . Pick up knives and axes . Comrades , we are one another 's saviors . The earth we walk upon is ours . p. 9 THE PEOPLE now on their feet : Land ! Freedom and land . Land ! Give us land or die . Land ! We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Give us land or die ! MAKHNO leads the peasants off to take possession of the land . VOLINE follows . GALINA sits down to wait . WOMAN Where is Nestor Makhno ? Does n't he hear his mother calling ? Where has Nestor Makhno gone ? GALINA He 's gone with the men to take land . He 'll be back when the deed is done . WOMAN Has n't he heard ? The landlord 's sons burned his mother 's house to the ground . They shot his brother through the head . His mother clawed out the eyes of the one who held her and ran screaming for Nestor into the fire . She burned like a witch . Her red , beating heart is all that is left . Do you think your charm is stronger than hers was ? Do you think you 're safe because he said he loved you once ? GALINA I 'll wait here for Nestor . Who will tell him what happened if I do n't wait ? Who will comfort him if I ca n't ? WOMAN laughing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Women give all they believe to love . But revenge is what rules us . Revenge is how fate plays with us . No one is free of the wish for it , not the ones who fight , not the ones who wait . All know the rule of hate . MAKHNO and VOLINE enter from the battle . GALINA goes to MAKHNO . He embraces her , but does not speak to her . GALINA has no chance to tell him the news. p. 10 NESTOR MAKHNO Voline ! Come here . Bring the book you write in . Hold it open under my hand . Now , gather round me . Can you all hear me ? Can you all see me ? I , Nestor Makhno , swear on the pages of the book of my friend Voline never to leave Gulai-Polye until the town of my birth is free . Every man among us will strive to kill whoever oppresses us . All who seek to exploit us will die . We can trust no one who is not one of us . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to enslave us . Not the Bolsheviks who claim they are one with us . If anyone comes to the Ukraine to impose laws on us or to take land from us or to make us serve their cause , they must die . I , Nestor Makhno , swear with my life to bring freedom to Gulai-Polye . Who among you swears with me ? THE PEOPLE I 'm one with Makhno . So am I. Will freedom bring us shoes ? Of course . And beer ? Whisky stole from the Tzar . Then count me in . I swear to free Gulai-Polye or die . Me too , I want to swear . I 'm just a woman , but I 'm with you . I 'll follow Makhno anywhere . Me too . NESTOR MAKHNO Well sworn . Let 's go drink to it . THE PEOPLE exit . VOLINE Wait , Nestor , you 've sworn a fine oath before your soldiers and they 've replied in kind . But war shortens everyone 's memory . In a month or two if all who watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what remains of what you 've done today ? You 've sworn your oath , now I 'll swear mine . Give me your dagger to swear on . I swear never to touch this or any other weapon . . . p. 11 NESTOR MAKHNO One battle makes a coward out of you . VOLINE To the contrary , one battle moves me to make a hero out of you . NESTOR MAKHNO You think men fight for no other reason than to put words into the mouths of poets ? VOLINE Men fight for many reasons that would all die with them if a poet did not think to leave a meaning that will live after them . NESTOR MAKHNO What gets done remains , Voline , not what is said . VOLINE Nothing is done that is not first dreamed deep in the solitude where dreams begin . When your hands and feet were chained you used your aching skull to bang your love of freedom through the rat-infested wall . I heard your call and answered with my own , and another would have , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumed him . Nestor , your deeds require words that reissue as their own from the hearts of other men . Let me serve you in this way . I will keep the people faithful to your cause . NESTOR MAKHNO Give me back my knife . I release you from orders to bear arms . The man who makes myths must be free of the deeds myths are made from , just as the one who does what needs to be done must be freed from the need to remember . MAKHNO cuts his arm with his knife . He offers the bloody arm to VOLINE to kiss. p. 12 NESTOR MAKHNO Let us seal our pact . One of us can not exist alone . My deeds and your words unite now and for all time . NESTOR exits . GALINA starts after him . VOLINE Galina , do n't hurry away . The longer he waits for his soup the better it will taste to him . The more you hold yourself from him the happier he 's likely to make you . GALINA As long as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever likely to make me happy . It 's not bad enough he 's sworn to continue fighting , his best friend has sworn to glorify suffering . VOLINE You judge me too harshly . GALINA I do n't judge you at all , but I have an oath of my own to make . VOLINE To whom will you swear ? GALINA To my own ears . VOLINE On what . . . GALINA I 'll swear with my feet on the earth my head in the air with the wood for the fire and a bucket of water held in my arm . VOLINE What will you swear ? GALINA I swear that my words will not be separate from my deeds . p. 13 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE The camp . VOLINE sings to the troops . VOLINE Sometimes circumstance makes a hero of a man who neither wished it nor wanted it so . A single injustice or terror turns farmer to warrior while his fields cry for seeds beneath the boots of soldiers . Bewitched by some unknown charm this man leaves all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms , the new son she grows for him inside . Who knows where his courage comes from , how it thrives , or why one man 's brave deeds might need a hundred lives . ELENA KELLER hooded , in man 's clothes : Who 's in charge here ? MAN We 're all equal here . SECOND MAN Say what you want to say . Each one of us has ears . ELENA KELLER Keep your wits about you . Do n't confuse me with what I have to say . It 's bad news I bring . MAN If it 's bad news , that 's a good reason to share your burden equally . SECOND MAN Though the messenger comes as a stranger , misfortune is well known to us and we no longer fear her . ELENA KELLER The words I speak sound harsh to my ears , if not yours , yet I say what I saw with my own eyes . A thousand Whites took Bol'Shaya last night . They burned Bol'Shaya to the ground . They herded the men together in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were raped , then thrown down the well . Each man who begged the soldiers to stop had his head hacked off . p. 14 THE PEOPLE keening their lament : Bol'Shaya is lost . Gulai-Polye is next . Where can we run to ? Who should we hide from ? How will we know them ? Who can help us ? Who can save us ? MAKHNO enters . NESTOR MAKHNO Who spoke the madness that led to this ? What sorcerer took my people and with a few idle words drained their strength and left them weak and whining on the earth ? First , I 'll undo your evil spell and give them back their sense . Then , we 'll free Bol'Shaya and kill the men who have misused her . ELENA KELLER I did n't come to challenge you , or to turn your friends away from you . I came to save you . Escape with your lives . Hide . NESTOR MAKHNO Who are you ? ELENA KELLER turning away from him : Masha Kovalskaia . NESTOR MAKHNO A woman dares give me orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELENA KELLER Maybe you remember my brother , Nikolai , a fine , strong boy ? He was with you in Butyrki Prison . He 's mad now . And maybe you remember my mother Gesia ? She slept twelve years on the cold prison stones just to be near him . Each day , she begged the guards for news of him ; each day they told her he was fine and promised she 'd see him if she 'd wait out the afternoon . Here , look at the heroes courage gets you . p. 15 MOTHER leading her demented son : Come , come Nikolai . Soon we 'll be home in Bol'Shaya again . I dreamt last night of the Tzar . He pities his poor peasant lads . He looked hard into your eyes . He built you a fire with his own hands . NIKOLAI Land . Land . Give us land or shoot us . Land . Land . Give us land or let us die . NESTOR MAKHNO The fight for freedom does n't end with the wreck of one old mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps her face hidden from him : You did n't hear my words . I saw the whole of Bol'Shaya destroyed . Every man who waved his scythe in the invader 's face was butchered with his own thirsty blade . They are a hired force . A peasant 's life is less to them than a stalk of wheat a peasant gives his life to grow . We know each hill and crevice of this land . Let 's hide . Let them waste their strength on a futile chase . GALINA Nestor , listen to this woman . Turn around and warn the rest of Gulai-Polye . We 'll hide . The Whites will find an empty town . NESTOR MAKHNO Go sit by the fire and be silent . You hear the words of one frightened girl and all you think to do is parrot her . Perhaps the women of Gulai-Polye would welcome our disgrace . Do we hide while the Whites rape our wives or do we free Bol'Shaya and avenge the dishonor already done ? I 'll go alone , with ten men or thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will . I 'll go , too . I 'll avenge Bol'Shaya . Comrade , take my hand . I 'm one with you . PEASANT WOMAN to her man : Speak up , you coward . Or do you want me raped ? MAN All right , I 'll go . ANOTHER WOMAN to her man : I 'd be raped before I 'd have you dead . ANOTHER MAN What good would that do ? I could n't look at you again . I 'm one with Makhno . MEN I am , too . Me , too . Count me in . VOLINE Then all of you , come , gather round . Galina , dry your eyes . Your love makes you greedy for his safety . But he can neither be son to a single mother nor husband to one woman . Here is a man who risks himself for many , who sets himself above a single love . Nestor Makhno , before this battle , I reclaim for you the old honored title Batko . You are " Father " to the thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage Batko asks of you , you each will rise above the limits of your isolated lives . Alone , you would live out your days unknown . Now you 've found parts in a larger story . Follow Batko into battle . Your legend on earth will grow as you fight through this glorious day . p. 17 MEN chanting : Batko has our faith . Our pride . The MEN and WOMEN exit . MOTHER Here Nikolai . We 'll wait here for the Tzar . GALINA How like his old jailors his new followers have become . They can not see their strength apart from their claim upon his life . Today he gives away the chance to live outside the cruel devotion of the crowd . ELENA KELLER who is disguised as the MESSENGER : Yes , and all the people relinquish is their lives . What is this cause that embraces all yet passes by the sacrifice of each without a pause ? What devouring beast moves us , naming itself justice ? GALINA Now that I see your face , I know your voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nestor outside Butyrki Prison . Why did n't you let him see you ? ELENA KELLER I could n't plead with him if he saw my face . I could n't let him call me coward in my own name . There is a bond between us that is as yet unbroken . Once we worked like brothers building one another 's houses . We moved as close as horses in a single harness . We hid for days so near in thought we all but forgot the difference in our sex and yet the rush of desire often fused us till danger and the deed we 'd done had both been overcome . When he turned from me to you that day he left behind a trust uncommon in our time . And , now , numb , since that moment numbed me , I can not tell if I came here to warn him or to humble him . If I could choose I do n't know if I 'd choose to be his follower , executioner , savior , wife , or to be Nestor Makhno himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOUR Bol'Shaya was saved by NESTOR 's men but then seized by the enemy again . NESTOR 's troops have retreated to regroup . There is a momentary lull . VOLINE , with pencil and pad , GALINA , with a shirt she is embroidering , ELENA , silent , rest together underneath a tree . VOLINE What 's the matter , Galina , has inspiration fled and left you idle , too ? GALINA It 's hard to embroider defeat . Here , on the front , I 've stitched the rout by our thirty of one thousand enemy men , but the news Bol'Shaya has fallen again leaves the sleeves and back desolate . Among the women who have done this work before me , hardly one could have been spared some dread loss in battle , yet where in their endless labor was there room for anger or for fear , for hate or for revenge , for all the feelings that lead men to war and that poets sing of ? Nestor lives  --  my fingers should be racing with that news , but they are stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delights the eyes of those who if they heard your soul 's cry would turn and trample hard upon its truth . GALINA No one has turned on you , Voline , not yet . When you spoke to men of freedom they took up the theme and gave it richer by a hundred voices back again . When you christened Nestor Batko , they responded with a trust so strong it led everyone up to the point of death and some beyond . p. 20 ELENA KELLER There 's the evil lie to art , the artist 's sin . You 've made pain wonderful . Gained sentences from sorrow . You 've turned murder into fate . Given permanence to hate . GALINA The poet does n't invent these things . The people give them to him . ELENA KELLER A single poet , through word or action , might yet imagine what for their heroes ' sakes whole peoples crowded into images of slaughter ca n't . What if Helen had refused to go to Troy ? What if her will was such that she said " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start ? Homer 's epic would have been reshaped and all the men who choose to follow violent ways would have to do it without the poet 's praise . VOLINE The poet 's praise or blame are equally absurd in times like ours and if , because of some horrible curse known only to him , the poet 's voice can not be stilled , he has no choice but to give it to the common cause . ELENA KELLER You 've let your loyalty blind you . You 've forbid yourself the poet 's right to be separate and apart . VOLINE Once I lived alone , apart from other men . There was no fear , no grief , my heart could not contain and tongue heave up again transformed . I thought the poetry I wrote , by changing single consciousness , would change social life itself . I endured the prison years knowing this one task would save me . Though the one I loved through those dark prison walls could speak of nothing but revenge . Even when free . . . when his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourners and smiled the smile smiled at the grave by slight acquaintances , I still felt the force within me through which each grief is changed . But others stumbled underneath each loss , many more were beaten down , until even I could not go on . Beauty , passion , imagination became so much dust upon a monument called human suffering . I disowned the isolated exaltation I had known . I took up the fight that will enslave me until the cause itself gathers up the strength to free me. p. 21 ELENA KELLER Freedom is not a burden to be disowned , Voline . Once won it might be won again . The bravest thought becomes a shackle to the mind and must be thought beyond . The effort 's all , Voline , renewing itself through rest . The effort to give shape to what we long for is the only part of life that is eternal . VOLINE What 's done by every man becomes the only pattern that we know . The evil done is all that is passed on . Once bent into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . ELENA KELLER To let another suffer less than we have suffered , that supernatural act would be sufficient proof of grace to comfort us . The inequality of pain through time should be the sole inequality we know once we can trust the end of war is worth giving form to : MAKHNO enters . NESTOR MAKHNO My friends , talking to the traitor in our midst . The fall of Bol'Shaya saddens two of you . Does it amuse the third ? Do you think it proves you right ? Should we have run instead of fought ? ELENA KELLER I think it proves the shame of war , a shame in which we each have equal share . NESTOR MAKHNO The only shame is fear . Fear of what winning a war must mean . I liberated Bol'Shaya with thirty men . Thirty men chased away one thousand while the peasants stood and watched us free them . Bol'Shaya was free before I left her , and would have stayed so . The trembling of the common heart betrayed her . When the enemy returned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front and back were slaughtered , peasants in the center raised their voices to pray louder . Small animals caught in traps give out odors calling their captors closer . Freedom is dead in Bol'Shaya . Peasants whored for pity rather than defend her . p. 22 ELENA KELLER A people afraid of their strength can not act . NESTOR MAKHNO Once you had the will to teach them to pick up arms and live . ELENA KELLER I killed a man as an example to others like him who seek their immortality in murder . I asked no one else to die for what I did . NESTOR MAKHNO There was a peasant boy who heard you . Your deed transformed him . ELENA KELLER I did n't think to live beyond my act . Then the deed was done and I lived on . You want me to lie down with the act again and claim its issue as my own . But I renounce the marriage bed where once the best was wedded to the worse in me . Why is it that the worst is all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did however you want to . Your deed remains and will live on , though you turn traitor to the cause whose needs have proved too great for you . ELENA KELLER I found the lie outside my heart as well as in it . That peasant boy grew up and as he grew I watched him harden and turn cold . Though his soft curls and simple laughing ways once gave me back the will to live when I had lost it . ELENA exits . MAKHNO waves VOLINE after her. p. 23 NESTOR MAKHNO What were you talking to her about ? GALINA Poetry and an old war . NESTOR MAKHNO What war ? Who won and how ? GALINA After ten years fighting for the return of Helen . . . He grabs her , they begin to tumble in an embrace . NESTOR MAKHNO Fair Helen , if time can be exchanged for passion at least ten years have passed since last I saw you sitting underneath this tree . Yet you seem fresher than the morning air to me . GALINA If Helen 's conquered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it must know how it 's been done . NESTOR MAKHNO The soldier has amnesia looking at his bride . Who could care for war when one can win at love ? GALINA Dissembling is the tactic the Greeks used . An artful maneuver , not unknown to you , useful when the use of force wo n't do . To end the war with Troy that would not end the Greeks hid inside a wooden horse and sent it to the city under siege . Awe before the wooden horse caused the Trojans to forget their own town 's defense . At that moment , Greek soldiers leapt to strike admiring heads from Trojan shoulders . p. 24 NESTOR MAKHNO Enough . . . I 'll borrow the ancient trick but use a vehicle modern people wonder at . I 'll steal a train and fill it with our men , then sneak our forces into every station . Our daring will stir the idle peasants who love fine stories like the one you told but fear persistence in the art of war . In a week the Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach his songs in , you 'll have your belly full of a son . I 'll be lazy , drunk and out of work . Till then come be with me . We 'll share a taste of victory . GALINA and MAKHNO exit , arm in arm. p. 25 Act 1 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE The peasant men and women enter amid much excited laughter and talk . The mission has been a success . Everyone is high on the victory as they gather to name the first free commune in the free Ukraine . FIRST MAN You should have seen the station master 's face when he tried to inspect our train ! SECOND MAN He was even more surprised when Makhno 's bullet hit him straight between the eyes ! THIRD MAN Peasants came from everywhere to welcome us . They jumped aboard our train . The girls , the girls , we took them anyway we could . FOURTH MAN In the next town , a wealthy man was talking to some troops . We tied him up and let him watch while men he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before our bullets into them .

Everywhere the people cheered . Virgins spread their legs . Their fathers filled us up with so much beer we could not tell if we shot friend or foe as we sped along toward home . Heroes of the free Ukraine . Feared by everyone . VOLINE moves to silence the crowd , and to turn their energy around from tales of war to work of peace. p. 26 VOLINE Comrades ! What does it mean to learn how to read when before you 've just known to make war ? How do you still the desire to kill and end the compulsion to own ? Learn skills . New deeds make creative wills . Learn to think . There are more than enough thoughts to go around . Knowledge increases once it 's found . Learn to write . There 's immortality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of fearful people . Words make poets from the same material . FIRST MAN Voline , what do we do with the evil we 've done ? VOLINE Remember its causes ; forget the old responses . FIFTH MAN What do we do about evil men ?

FIFTH MAN We wanted some land where we could farm and a town where we could build but the Whites bled red and the Reds bled red and kept us from this work . VOLINE Good ! Very good ! But should we pick the first name we 've heard ? GALINA I 'll sing a song that explains how Batko Makhno already has a bearer of his name . VOLINE Go ahead , Galina . GALINA In the middle of the battle on a bloody afternoon , life came inside my empty belly and whispered to me , " Life remains . " With murder all around me and fear cowering in my breath , life squirmed its way inside me to hide a little while from death . I , the frightened woman , frightened for the man I love , let him go to free the city while life fluttered in me like a dove .

So all you men who fight for freedom , all you men both brave and true , leave your seed inside a woman . Then death ca n't have the best of you . p. 29 VOLINE It seems Nestor Makhno 's going to have a son . Should he have a commune to carry on his name as well ? ELENA KELLER There 's a woman , not of our country , who herself died bravely in service to ideals not unlike ours . Hear my song . Perhaps you 'll name the commune after her . Sings Rosa Luxemburg is dead . Rosa Luxemburg is dead . She was killed last night . She was killed last night . Who killed her ? Army officers beat her . Drunken men killed her . Why did she have to die ? Why did she have to die ? She spoke against war ; she said : " Unrelenting revolutionary activity coupled with boundless humanity  --  that alone is the real life-giving force of socialism . A world must be overturned , but every tear that has flowed and might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man hurrying to perform a great deed who steps on even a worm out of unfeeling carelessness commits a crime . " She who had such passion in her heart aroused such hate . Why is that ? Rosa Luxemburg is dead . Rosa Luxemburg is dead . She was killed last night . She was killed last night . They took her shoe when they threw her in the river . What did they do with her shoe ? What did they do with her shoe ? They drank champagne from it . They drank champagne from it . p. 30 NESTOR MAKHNO Let Rosa Luxemburg be the name of our first free commune . She suffered enough for this gift , leaving a song on a brave sister 's lips , while Nestor Makhno 's army will leave a thousand sons behind , each one a tiller of this fertile ground . VOLINE Is Rosa Luxemburg the name we choose ? ALL Yes ! NESTOR MAKHNO Well done , Elena . I learned something . ELENA KELLER It 's been long since you looked at me long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me . Your eyes have been harsher to look upon than the barrel of Deniken 's gun . The words you spoke were rougher than the Bolsheviks ' fire . ELENA KELLER The soldier left his lover standing at the prison gates , he was the one who did not look back . NESTOR MAKHNO He was consumed by other things . His fever dream of freedom turned him into a leader of men and caught him up in other men 's needs . Now the victory is won and he must go back to where the dream began , to sunset on the steppes and our great plans . He needs to hear his lost girl 's voice rising amid the evening songs of the birds and the reckless answers of the frogs . He wants to delight in harmony in which he 's had no part , to be comforted by shadows and the golden light and led beyond the soldier 's hardened thoughts . . . Elena , we 've waited for so long . I have grown strong enough to bend to your great will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and MAKHNO exit , arm in arm. p. 31 MOTHER Galina , come sit by the fire with me . You 're ripe as a purple plum tree but your man ca n't see . He 's off with the one with the silver tongue , whose belly 's as hard as a log , who fears what she does , fear shows in her eyes . He 'll come back to you . The woman who gets them when they 're wild like that is the woman who waits . She 'll run as soon as he 's touched her . He 'll be back when she 's gone , bringing flowers from the field where they 've lain . GALINA What gives him the right to walk through the world like this , churning the earth under his feet , seeding the barren plot , leaving me wild and lush . . . MOTHER singing : I had a lover who went to war singing , " If I ever get back bring me a pear . " I had another who caught a fever singing , " Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His fable was short ; his fable was simple : peasant , fighter , factory worker share one power all together . There 's no escape from rape , young girl . There 's no escape from rape . I gave him an apple , he held it above me , he was a believer in patriarchy . The one I gave the pear to left me , all in the name of anarchy . There 's no escape from rape , dumb girl . There 's no escape from rape . p. 32 Act 1 , Scene 6 SCENE SIX Once MAKHNO 's troops had rid the Ukraine of the Whites and the people had begun to establish independent communes , the Bolsheviks decided to take over the Ukraine and they turned on the Ukrainian anarchists once again . Trotsky 's troops marched into the territory and , then , the Whites also returned . MAKHNO 's followers were beaten ; the anarchist movement was destroyed . VOLINE Peace did n't last , how could it ? Gulai-Polye was invaded ; Reds from the north swept through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each raised swords over us . Threatened by peace they ended the moment of peace we began . Elena left to bring help . Makhno 's army hid on the steppes . The women and children who lived abandoned the town of their birth and ran after the men . Every time the broken army turned around to hide from the enemy guns they found the image of their own defeat beind them . Wounded women and battered children lived in the dust raised by the feet of the soldiers . What was left of the army could not flee what was left of the town . They were of one flesh , after all . Dressed in a priest 's vestment he has found on the battlefield , leaning on his mother , the demented NIKOLAI chants . NIKOLAI In the last days perilous times shall come . For men shall be lovers of their own selves , covetous , boasters , proud , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unholy . Without natural affection , truce breakers , false accusers , fierce , despisers of those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pleasures more than lovers of God . Having godliness but denying the power of God : from such turn away , for of this sort are they that creep into houses and lead captive women laden with sins , led away with divers lusts . . . p. 33 RAPED WOMAN Bless me , father , for I have sinned . NIKOLAI The Lord will bless you , for He is good . RAPED WOMAN Oh , my God , I am heartfully sorry for having offended Thee . I detest all my sins . I detest in myself the causes of them and all the pride that led me to them . NIKOLAI The Lord will bless you , for He is good . The Lord will grant absolution unto you . What have you done , daughter , what have you done ? RAPED WOMAN I have witnessed many things . Many foul , unclean deeds have I seen . I could not stop them , but neither could I turn my eyes away from them . Bless me , father , for I have sinned . NIKOLAI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Lord will grant absolution unto you . What have you seen , daughter , what have you seen ? RAPED WOMAN I saw an old woman , yellow with age . Her cracked breasts hung on her yellow flesh . I saw her taken by soldiers . I saw them , one after the other , plunge into her . " Mother , mother , " they cried . Each one , in turn , buried his face in her chest and begged for the love of her who had already died . And though they cried , they did not stop abusing her . Neither did they notice she was still . Only I saw all this . I could not stop them , but neither could I turn my eyes away from them . Bless me , father , for I have sinned. p. 34 NIKOLAI The Lord will bless you , for He is good . What have you seen , daughter , what have you seen ? RAPED WOMAN My child . My child . A girl of seven , sweet smelling and young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . She was too small to receive them . One took a dagger from under his belt . He sliced open the sweet pink flesh between her legs . " Baby , baby , " he cried . But she , terrified , could not cry , neither could she run . Her strong young legs lay useless under her , split apart by a knife . " Flesh of my flesh , " I cried . " My child , my child , " I cried . I could not stop him , but neither could I turn my eyes away from him . Bless me , father , for I have sinned . NIKOLAI The Lord will bless you , for He is good . The Lord will grant absolution unto you . What have you seen , daughter , what have you seen ? RAPED WOMAN The same soldier entered me .

Still I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I have sinned . NIKOLAI The Lord will bless you , for He is good . Give of yourself to the Lord and you will know goodness the rest of your days . NIKOLAI falls on her , as if to rape her in his turn . The MOTHER watches . MAKHNO enters with GALINA . He pulls NIKOLAI off the WOMAN . GALINA is now quite pregnant . She moves slowly. p. 35 NESTOR MAKHNO Dog . Enough . I 've seen enough without having to see this . You wo n't breed a race of lunatics while I have breath . Get to the front with what 's left of my men . And you , get back with the rest of your sex . GALINA begins to go with the MOTHER and the RAPED WOMAN ; MAKHNO pulls her back . NESTOR MAKHNO They go on their own . You stay away from them . GALINA Who else will comfort them when their hero turns his head away ? NESTOR MAKHNO They 're past comfort now . GALINA Am I any less unclean than the women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingly did you use me any more lovingly than your enemies used them ? Their sin is branded on them openly , but mine is burned as deep inside . I know what I am . You pretend I 'm clean because your own needs have to stay pure in your own eyes . But I 've watched while without wishing to you recoil from my smell . I 've seen how you despise the same flesh you enter through . Even now my ripeness angers you , though its fruit is yours . NESTOR MAKHNO Galina , for kindness 's sake add one bitter truth to the bitter truth you spoke . Defeat has wronged me far more than ever I wronged a woman . I loved you as well as I was able . I loved Gulai-Polye and lost her , too . p. 36 GALINA You did not love her as she was . You sought her only as she might become . The simple moment never gave you pause and now the simple life is lost . NESTOR MAKHNO No loss can take the memory of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of our lives spent desolate , no loss can take the memory of love away . In silence , at strange times , the memory of love will come , the wretched longing rise . Then I know how it was with us . How , while war raged all around , I found a place to rest within your arms . GALINA My swollen frame is proof that love once had returns . The day we made this child was pure . Nothing had hurt us so badly then that we could not love again . And , now , the pure begotten child spins . Each quickening the promise of a love renewed . NESTOR MAKHNO Galina , wife , whether I 've earned it or not , woman inside whose flesh a part of me revives , can you also save Gulai-Polye ? It 's a desperate thing I ask , but I have no choice . We are a conquered people if we do not stage this fight . There is one chance we might reclaim our land . I 've sent Elena through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have grown loyal to our cause . They will sell us guns and , for a price , will fight along with us . Take this map to her . If she receives it in good time , all is not lost . We 'll meet in three days , advancing from two sides and begin our attack in the place I 've circled here . We 'll stage a battle which , if desperation gives us strength , might bring us the peace to raise our child . . . Galina , wear this while you go . It was my mother 's cross . May it keep you safe until you are back within my sight . p. 37 GALINA Many times I 've tried to leave you to the other woman you have loved , but always as I crept around the corner I always thought I heard you whisper " Stay . " So I kept my body rooted to a spot where you could find it , and I willed my heart be still . Now you send me off to bring Elena back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do as you ask , wearing this cross you 've hung around my neck . GALINA leaves . VOLINE enters . VOLINE You should have sent me in her place . The route is overrun with Trotsky 's men . NESTOR MAKHNO A pregnant woman can travel unsuspected . Your face is on the posters next to mine . " Wanted . Two anarchist criminals . Nestor Makhno and Voline . " He laughs . Together we 've caused quite a row . Besides , Voline , how could I have sent you off before a fight ? In better times , we used to walk the fields all night , stopping for a drink at every soldiers ' camp . When we could hold no more we fell asleep beneath a tree or in a ditch and dreamt of victory or of some woman 's lingering touch . Come , Voline , it is a night like that . VOLINE Yes , we 'll be comrades one more time . p. 38 Act 1 , Scene 7 SCENE SEVEN Before the battle . Two groups of sleeping bodies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , NIKOLAI , intertwined . VOLINE The soldier lies sleeping in my arms . He has spent the whole night sleeping sound . Though I thought to wake him when the first dread images appeared , some long forgotten self took hold of me . I could not move . I sat watching the past do a slow dance of the dead on the rim of my own dim consciousness . I saw each corpse of those who died for this great cause . Each one turned his hollow face and beckoned with his hand . But when I strained to see where they had gone , the heart beat of the soldier in my arms made my sight grow dim . The soldier sleeps on undisturbed . Have you forgotten all those prison nights we waited to be shot when I held you while you cried and you held me until the sun rose on brave composure and strength ? Or in the silence of your solitary sleep have you , also , been visited by ghosts ? Will you wake and look me in the eyes ? Silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , killing , died ? MOTHER halfway awake , still twined in the limbs of her son : I dreamt I gave birth to the worst sin on earth and it hid itself under my skirts where it lived until it grew big . I , among all of my sex , was chosen because of my age , my brittle flesh and sour milk , to give birth to the worst sin on earth . Only I would continue to live while the worst sin on earth dug its teeth into me and ate itself free . Only I would not die of this birth . p. 39 NESTOR MAKHNO Voline , Voline , move , Voline , move off me . I 'm full of the most wonderful dream . But it 's no wonder I dreamt of prison , you 're pressing in on me closer than the prison bars . I dreamt of a magic ring . It was a talisman , fashioned by the great goddess of the social revolution , the radiance of all-conquering love in her eyes . She stood at my bedside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended above me , half in blessing , half pointing toward the dark wall  --  there , in a crevice something luminous glowed . It was a heart-shaped ring . Impulsively , I reached out and plucked the ring from its dark corner . I put it on my finger and suddenly its rays burst into a fire that spread and instantly melted the iron and steel and dissolved the prison walls , disclosing green fields and woods and men and women playfully at work in the sunshine of freedom . Then something dispelled the vision . Voline , your weight took the dream away . The MOTHER crawls toward MAKHNO . As she goes , her son wakes and cries out for her . NIKOLAI Maaa . . . MOTHER her bad dream now dispelled : Blessed Mary , Mother of God , we are saved , here is a wonderful son , strong and brave . NIKOLAI cries : Maaa . . . VOLINE goes to him. p. 40 MOTHER attaching herself to MAKHNO : I was too long at the cross . I was too long mourning for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardly the goddess I need . Life gives off bitter laughter after such a dream . Where is the joy I knew in my sleep ? All my friends and followers reduced to this stale mass of useless flesh , while , in my heart , the dream still rages . There 's a plot for you , my friend . Hide these ugly facts in some spellbinding song and use it to stir up the will to win inside my men . MAKHNO exits . The MOTHER follows him . NIKOLAI lets out a final cry of loss : Maaa . . . VOLINE Turn your dull head toward the uncomprehending sun . Drink up the warmth that men ca n't give to other men . Remember , if you can , the month or two we spent when Nestor and you and I could reach each other once or twice a day through those dark prison walls . We were happy , then , stroking one another 's matted hair , touching cracked lips between the damp , chipped prison bars . We three were prisoners of the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure hearts would dare exact a punishment as great . Here we are in one another 's arms . Once again , he 's fled . Tonight , we may all be dead . Nothing is left except this passionate connection which endures despite violent recognition of need that can not be filled . p. 41 Act 1 , Scene 8 SCENE EIGHT Having successfully brought the guns to the reinforcements of MAKHNO 's army , ELENA and GALINA , very pregnant , joined by the old MOTHER , wait near a lake while the battle is fought . GALINA The moon is a victim of heavy , tumultuous clouds . They open and close jaw-like around her . What is temporary and low eats up the high permanent light . The moon is full in the power of her captors now . Her light is fully out . Will the elemental fight above spare us from the terrible fight below ? Now , the belly-full clouds turn radiant . A glow from the world 's lost soul , gentle and wonderful , lights the sky from within . The grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will be spared nothing at all by the moon 's forced absence . ELENA KELLER The first dull rumble of the guns rolls through the earth toward us and thunders back again toward where the battle has begun . Nestor 's deep in danger now . Voline behind him . And all the other lesser men we once smiled upon are far past any wish of ours to save them . Each one has given up his heart to war . MOTHER Women , what have you done , giving guns to men you love , sending your men to war ? Women , what have you done trading your power for the power of a gun ? You have come so far from when you lived at peace , apart from men . Women , what have you done , trading your power for the power of a gun ? One by one you let men lead you away from the houses of your mothers and your mothers blessed you . One by one , you learned to love them beyond all others and your daughters forgave you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and sent them to fight . Love and hate formed a knot deep in the pattern you wove ; helpless before it you let men rip it apart with their swords . Now you 've begun seasons of war without end . Women , what have you done trading your power for the power of a gun ? p. 42 ELENA KELLER The catalog of all your sins assails me equally as my sins assail you . It is a book of pages without end , what women have done and will do again . You watched while the ruined flesh you gave birth to once poured his lust into woman after war-stained woman . " He has a right to them , " you said , " the defiled have a right to the defiled . " Wasted with weak , hurt with hated , bent with stunted mate , the worst of life survives . This is the union you 've allowed . GALINA to ELENA : You ran by my side , your hand in mine , through enemy lines , past newly-burned barns , over fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell you steadied me . When you lost the way I found it . We did not speak , nor could we , not from fear of being caught but because cold hatred for the other body that we touched had silent hold on all our thought . You had lain wrapped around the man I love and with your arms and legs and wild insatiable heart had used me up to give him strength . ELENA KELLER You spread yourself , defenseless , on the hill while our proud eagle picked away at you . Every time he drew blood , you dug your nails deeper into the new wound and screamed . Whenever someone asked you to be strong , you cowered behind the mask of weakness you 'd put on and cried out against the same abuse you craved . You eat your own flesh . The destruction you commit is criminal , yet it has been sanctioned for all time . The sacrifice of self is the single wrong we might grow beyond . p. 43 MOTHER My lost daughters , speak no more . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wounded heart I hear . In a wild flight let the cry soar , turn , be transformed and changed until forgiveness comes to pulse in the same spot where once the wound was all that could be felt . Death and dying dance together , Dance until they disappear . This is a night for our rejoicing , This is a night for our rebirth . Spin three times around . See your face in the lake each time . The first time round say who you are . The second time round say what you wish . The third time round take what you need . This is a night to heal wounds . For one moment all is different , all is changed , all is as it could have been had women not suffered other 's pain . GALINA I see a jealous face in the lake . Jealousy is not my face . Who can be jealous who can give birth ? Jealousy 's a spell that I 've been cast in , undo the curse , undo the curse . ELENA KELLER My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the face of absolute diligence , perfect correctness . Make my face multiple and various . MOTHER For one moment all is different all is changed all is as it could have been had women not suffered other 's pain . Spin three times around . The second time round say what you wish , see your face in the moon this time . This is a night to heal wounds . p. 44 GALINA I sought a kindness I had never felt and sought to wrench that unfelt kindness from the numb place inside myself and so fill up the world with it that it would fill my heart . I thought the loneliness would end . I did not know that out of longing only longing comes . Now , while I 'm full of the unexpected , I can feel , as if for the first time , the stone I have made of the kindness I longed for . ELENA KELLER I have wished that the world be changed and have given my strength for that wish ever since I awoke from the empty privilege of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But only now have I grown innocent enough to wish the changes on this changing earth might each begin with us tonight , with what we know and what we 've dreamed , and what on this moon-blessed battlefield we might become . MOTHER Death and dying dance together . Dance until they disappear . This is a night for our rejoicing . This is a night for our rebirth . Spin three times around . The first time round say who you are . See your face in the lake this time . The second time round say what you wish . See your face in the moon . The third time round take what you need . See your face in whichever face you choose . This is a night to heal wounds . GALINA Look how the water reclaims a face I have feared by washing away each hard , impenetrable glance . Now I see the gentleness beneath your strength and sense your own tenderness and warmth . p. 45 ELENA KELLER Not the water , but your keen , caring sight has cracked apart the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild energy I felt must be tamed by someone larger than myself or it would set me far apart , exiled , alone , marked for my whole life , but now I know I needed warmth and someone gently brave enough to let me live out my highest self . I could not have seen myself until I saw my dreams reflected in the deep pools of your eyes . All my sorrows would not have made me wise . The two women embrace. p. 46 Act 1 , Scene 9 SCENE NINE VOLINE bursts in on the women . The battle has been lost . VOLINE Nestor 's wounded in the thigh and bleeding hard . Our men were fighting well until they saw their hero hit . Then they put down their guns and ran to him . They formed a wall of flesh around the hero they have loved . Many were shot and are left bleeding on the field we have fled . Many died protecting him . We have to smuggle Nestor out of the Ukraine . A peasant enters . FIRST MAN We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each and every one of us . As long as Batko lives the dream wo n't die . Other peasants enter carrying MAKHNO on a litter . FIRST MAN I 'll get a cart to put Batko in . SECOND MAN I 'll get some straw to lay him on . THIRD MAN I 'll get a horse to pull the cart . Cheers and activity . GALINA has been listening all the while as she kneels next to NESTOR . ELENA stands , watching the two of them . VOLINE begins to undress NIKOLAI , who has entered with the peasants. p. 47 VOLINE handing NIKOLAI 's robe to GALINA : Galina , hand Nestor 's jacket here . Our men will take him to the border in the wagon . You 'll have to find a way to smuggle him across . There are friendly guards at Vasil'Kov . I 'll go another way with the Mother 's son wearing Nestor 's coat . We 'll let Trotsky 's troops see us go and let them come chasing after us . ELENA KELLER taking VOLINE by the shoulders : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for a fair peace for Nestor 's men . I 'll remind him of our exile days when we three sat together in cafes , before the chance for power made strangers of us all . VOLINE hugging ELENA : Galina , take Nestor 's jacket off . GALINA she stands : I ca n't , Voline . VOLINE bends , removes NESTOR 's jacket and smooths NESTOR 's brow . ELENA KELLER embracing GALINA : Go with him , now , for me . He may yet live to see his child . GALINA I can not go , Elena . Nestor has to go alone . I can not follow any more . If everything that every peasant 's fought for depends upon the single life of a single man , it does n't matter if it 's Nestor , Trotsky or some other crueller than either of them . Someone whose power has yet to be imagined will surely come . He 's being conjured at this moment in the minds of millions who think their chance for life depends on sacrifice to someone else 's high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galina . Save yourself and the child . VOLINE kisses NESTOR . VOLINE Farewell , my friend . Galina , come , take his hand . He 's feverish and weak . VOLINE dresses NIKOLAI in NESTOR 's coat . Come , lad . You are the real hero of this tale . If I live , I 'll write a song for you . If we die together on this day we leave a humming in the air , an unsung song for unborn men to sing . They go . The MOTHER cries out , but does not follow them . She is going to go with NESTOR . FIRST MAN Lift Batko up . SECOND MAN Gently , gently , now . Woman , come . He needs a wife to wipe his brow . GALINA does not move : Bear your hero off . ELENA KELLER Go . Galina , go . Take your chance for happiness . GALINA places her hand on her big belly : My chance for happiness is here , within , and can not be claimed by watching peasants die to smuggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The child will soon be born . ELENA KELLER I have to go to Trotsky first . If I live , I will come back to rock your child . p. 49 GALINA You ca n't bargain with an angry man . He 'll torture you , or worse . ELENA KELLER Perhaps , but there is no one else who can negotiate with him . Someone has to work a peace for the Ukraine . GALINA Elena , give up the fight . It will not end until we give it up . Think of your own life and of the single truth your life might tell . ELENA KELLER My life . . . So much was asked of me always . So much demanded in answer to the terrible times in which I found myself . I though the burden would be lighter if I shouldered only common hopes and common dreams . My life ended when I was a girl . It was fixed when the shot I fired fell between the brass buttons on the police chief 's chest . Part of me withered and died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me thrilled to that violence . She lets go of GALINA 's hand . GALINA Elena , when we stood together all last night you named a fuller self . ELENA KELLER Yes , but it must wait . ELENA kisses her and leaves . VOLINE enters carrying the body of the son , NIKOLAI . VOLINE He 's dead . They shot him in the back ten times before we 'd gone ten yards . And left me unharmed . He laughs , a bitter laugh . Now I can write the song I promised him . p. 50 GALINA Leave him here with me . I will lay him out . VOLINE You stayed . You loosened Nestor 's hold on you the minute that he needed you . GALINA The minute that I saw him plain . VOLINE Elena 's gone to Trotsky 's camp ? GALINA Yes . And seeks from that hard man the same compassion that she has . VOLINE I 'll go and lend my voice to hers . Once we knew him well . He was not bad . He wanted what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . VOLINE leaves . The Mother 's son , " gone in the head , " she often said . " Not what he was . " But how unjustly dead . Left without a mother to mourn you . She 's run off with the soldiers . An old woman who can barely walk , chasing after the mongrel pack . How hard the need for heroes dies . Is it any wonder Nestor lives beyond you ? A thousand and more lives create him : mothers and their sons , men who might have loved , children , horses , dogs , women like me who give off a spicy smell whenever he passes , women like her , brilliant and brave , all the riches of the natural world in service to a will that 's not our own . The earth that might have been green darkening and dying , the final burnt offering . Through it all the wish for heroes lives and we endure beside it : the image of the unborn child , the corpse and the lone woman wait . Night falls. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters carrying ELENA , unconscious , in his arms . The sun rises . VOLINE Galina , Nestor is safe because of this bruised shape I carry in my arms . She stood firm in front of Trotsky 's rage , refusing to tell where Nestor went . For it , she 's been beaten and abused . She can not walk , nor talk , nor understand . Mend her if you can . GALINA goes to ELENA . She settles her heavy frame down next to her . GALINA crooning comforting sounds to ELENA : Elena , look . Open up your eyes . Here we are . The two of us again . Hush , now . Hush . Let me wipe your brow . GALINA makes little comforting noises . She lays her cheek to ELENA 's cheek . She touches her flesh to ELENA 's flesh . She blows breath on ELENA 's face . She hums to her . She works slowly and carefully to restore life . VOLINE holding NIKOLAI 's dead body in his arms : Here is the son . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause worth more than his embittered soul might survive . I thought to make a hero of him in the end . I promised I would sing for him . But when he died , I felt my own breath stopped . Now , the tuneless corpse lies singing in my arms . " Care for unborn things , " he sings . The words hum in my blood . ELENA stirs in GALINA 's arms ; GALINA supports her as she speaks . ELENA gathers strength as she tells her tale. p. 52 ELENA KELLER In my prison cell where spiders , lice and fleas were all the bounty of this bounteous world thought fit to keep a woman company who would not obey or in the cold room where they beat me when I would not answer them , I learned no one can destroy the part of me that can respond to kindness only . Alone in that dark prison room , I found myself untouchable and strong . Alone , I found the strength to say , my torturers have no power over me . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cover me with anger and force me to receive your rage , but there is a part of me you can not touch and that one part survives . Angered by the impudence in my eyes , they raped me with the muzzles of their guns . " Talk , " they whispered in my ear . " Tell us where he went . " I shook my head . They pinched my breasts , slapped my face , raped me again . The world will perish in such hands as theirs . The earth will punish her unfaithful sons . Man makes his own destiny but he makes it only once . Unless the whole pattern is reversed and in each head a wakening occurs and in each heart a way to love what we most fear is found . I 've grown old before my time . I 'll die too soon . But there are n't many who have known a strength like mine or felt the sacred energy I 've felt or the delight of making the hard choices for the first time . GALINA Elena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must deliver myself . Voline , come , hold me up . Help me squat above the ground . Elena , breathe with me . Hold out your arms . Help me help the child out . VOLINE places himself behind GALINA and holds her up . They begin to move in the rhythm of birth . ELENA comes to her and begins to breathe with her , rubbing her belly . The image is of the three of them , VOLINE , ELENA and GALINA , as near-equal participants in the birth-effort . As the contractions quicken , ELENA reaches beneath GALINA 's skirts to receive the child . As GALINA makes the final push , we hear the birthcry . ELENA holds the infant in her arms , then puts it on GALINA 's breast . GALINA fusses with the baby a minute , then looks up.
