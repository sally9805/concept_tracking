Pushing toward independence , a tiny sultanate stalls for time <P> The issue was clear-cut : whether and when , after a century of colonial status , the tiny sultanate of Brunei should gain full independence . The British were understandably defensive . The Bruneians were altogether adamant . The strange thing about the situation , however , as the two sides met for discussions in London , was that this time it was the British who proposed to cast off their remaining colonial ties . On the other hand , Brunei 's Sandhurst-educated sultan , Sir Muda Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah , 32 , who led a retinue of 18 to the negotiating table in Whitehall , sought to hang on to the lion 's tail . <P> In the end , the two sides worked out a compromise . By 1983 Britain will withdraw what has become an anachronistic and embarrassing colonial presence in the steamy 2,226-sq. - mi. sultanate of 190,000 people on the north coast of Borneo ( see map ) . Meanwhile , British civil servants will continue to handle much of the sultanate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny backwater country , which a passing naval captain had chanced on 40 years earlier , formally became a British protectorate . In addition , London agreed to keep a battalion of tough Gurkha soldiers in Brunei ( pronounced Brew-nigh ) until the sultanate 's own Lilliputian army becomes more seasoned . Even the five-year transition period was a grudging concession by Sir Hassanal , who may be the world 's most Anglophile ruler . <P> Brunei 's maneuvering to retain British protection is based on oil . Tucked between the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak , the sultanate sits on an estimated 1.6 billion bbl. of petroleum . The government owns a 50% share in a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell , whose wells pump 230,000 bbl. per day ; it is also one-third owner of the world 's largest natural gas liquefaction plant . Brunei 's revenues should surpass $1 billion this year , and the national surplus , already $2.5 billion , will grow by another $700 million . <P> Brunei fears that Malaysia might be tempted to make a play for such wealth . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who abdicated in 1967 in favor of his son but remains a power behind the throne , have steadfastly insisted that the British stay . <P> <P> As a result , Brunei remains a quaint throwback to the days of the British raj . <P> Queen Elizabeth 's birthday is celebrated with a full-dress military parade and a flyby of the Brunei air force , which consists of twelve helicopters . The English commander of the 1,000-man Royal Brunei Malay Regiment is in effect the sultanate 's Defense Minister . The British High Commissioner handles foreign affairs and is chauffeured about the capital of Bandar Seri Begawan in a huge silver Daimler , given to him by the sultan . One of the few points of interest in the sleepy capital is a museum honoring Winston Churchill . Another landmark is the Royal Brunei Yacht Club , perched beside the Brunei River ; with its whirring ceiling fans and overcooked brussels sprouts , the club could easily serve as the setting for a Somerset Maugham short story . Unlike Churchill , Maugham once visited Bandar Seri Begawan and stayed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
