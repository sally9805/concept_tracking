txt President Ford 's much touted new amnesty program , criticized by antiwar draft counseling groups , is coming under renewed scrutiny by Pentagon and clemency officials . At the least , say clemency officials , initial processing " bottlenecks " in the program are being eliminated . There is speculation also that the clemency program may he extended beyond its Jan. 31 deadline next year . And close examination of individuals returning for amnesty is leading to policies designed to prevent widespread desertions in the future . To date , 1,797 individuals have been processed and discharged for the clemency program out of the roughly 10,000 to 11,000 deserters who might qualify . There have been 9,835 inquiries about the program . Out of some 6,200 eligible draft evaders , only 92 have come forth for processing , according to the Justice Department . One spokesman said the department expects many inquiries " around the holiday season later this year , or after Christmas . " As to the nine-person clemency review board , which can review the cases of some 8,700 individuals already convicted of draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honorable , the board has had some 598 applications for review , as of this writing . In a significant step , meanwhile , the Justice Department announced this week it is instructing all 92 U.S. attorneys to review the some 6,200 pending draft-evader cases and discharge those cases lacking " prosecutorial merit . " The upshot , say Justice officials , will be to substantially reduce the number of individuals liable to alter : nate service for draft evasion , // *Amnesty plan : still few takers // The program , announced by President Ford Sept. 16 , gives war deserters and draft evaders the opportunity for two years alternate service ? followed by a special " clemency discharge " ? as a method of clearing up their military records . The board , according to a spokesman , " will make whatever recommendations it deems necessary " during the months ahead ? lending credence to speculation the board may recommend that the program be continued The board , according to a spokesman , is now refining proce dures ? such as obtaining files more quickly Clemency board officials note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the individual may have records at different federal agencies . The board must then colate the material , make copies , and send the information to the individual concerned . He , or she , in turn , has the right to make inquiries , check legal counsel , and report back to the board ? again ? taking time . Pentagon officials say they have learned much from the program . The bulk of the deserters arriving at Ft Benjamin Harrison , according to a Pentagon official , have turned out to be essentially non-political , deserting for personal , rather than ideological reasons A few have beenwomen . The military is planning to use the " behavioral " information gleaned from its amnesty processing to prevent future desertions . Skepticism continues For ' their part , however , anti-war and draft counseling groups remain skeptical " We think this program is neither amnesty , just , nor lenient , " says Dave Brown , a spokesman for the Philadelphia-based Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors . Given the fact that relatively few persons have so far responded , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " admit the program was a flop ? or extend it for an additional period of time . "
