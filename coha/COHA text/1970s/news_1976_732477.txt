txt The players on the Middle East chessboard are moving their pieces to ensure maximum advantage for themselves on the next big day of decision , now only seven weeks away . That day is May 30 , when the mandate of the UN peacekeeping force on the Israel-Syria front on the Golan Heights expires . The United States wants renewal of the man ? date with as little fuss as possible , but at the same time would like to see momentum revived toward an overall Middle East settlement . Israel is for renewing the mandate but resists the idea of paying any price to Syria or the Palestinians for renewal . Syria is expected to try to exact as high a price as possible ( to be paid by Israel ) for allowing the UN force to stay . Syrian leader Hafez al-Assad knows that to be in a position to demand a price and get U.S. backing for it he needs : ( 1 ) to prevent the year long civil war in Lebanon from blowing up in his face ; and ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible and constructive behavior in producing the kind of compromise settlement in Lebanon that the U.S would like . This explains Mr. Assad 's brinkmanship in Lebanon ( with his partial military intervention ) and his virtual volte-face in flouting his one-time Muslim and Palestinian clients in // *Mideast chess game : where each side stands // Lebanon and insisting on a place for Lebanon 's Christians in any settlement . There is every indication that the U.S. is tacitly giving its blessing to what Mr. Assad is doing , while saying publicly that it is opposed to any outside military takeover in Lebanon . Israel for its part is watching cautiously what is going on across its northern border in Lebanon . It is scoring points with the U.S. by apparently heeding U.S. counsel and reacting so far with restraint to what Mr. Assad is doing there . ' It has also probably scored points with Washington by having the courage to let this week 's municipal elections go ahead on the occupied West Bank of the Jordan , even though  --  the results have indirectly given legitimacy to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least urban West Bankers . This is in effect one Israeli step toward dealing with the Palestinians as Palestinians ? which the U.S. ultimately wants . Slightly away from the center stage ? but still on Israel 's border ? Jordan sought this week to make ( rather than score ) a point with the U.S. The Jordanian government has decided to drop its long-pending deal with Washington for a Hawk missile air defense system . Announcing this in an interview with The Times while visiting London , Jordanian Prime Minister Zaid Rifai said : " The only other source which could supply Jordan on acceptable terms with an air defense system is the Soviet Union . " Mr. Rifai said Jordan was canceling the Hawkorder because pro-Israeli congressional opposition to it in the ? U.S. had delayed delivery until inflation had driven up the cost to double what Saudi Arabia had given his country to pay for the missile system . Jordan is in effect saying to the U.S. : " If you can not do better by the Arabs , if you can not deliver what you offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to Moscow . " Syrian President Assad ? to whom King Hussein of Jordan has been drawing closer in recent months ? would probably approve of such a message since he is counting on Washington 's delivering some kind of reward to him for his " good " behavior in Lebanon . Another of the main figures in the Middle East drama , Egyptian President Sadat , is moving in the opposite direction to that threatened by Jordan : having broken with Moscow , he is looking for alternative Western sources of supply for both military and economic aid . Like Mr. Assad , he feels that the U.S. is under an obligation to him for his " good " behavior ? a much bigger obligation in his eyes than any the U.S. might have to the Syrian President . Back from a second visit to Western Europe in the past six months , Mr. Sadat got the news Tuesday that the U.S. House International Affairs Committee has approved the $65 million sale of six transport aircraft to Egypt . While in Europe , Mr. Sadat made progress on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of modest economic aid from West Germany . But he still needs a lot more than that already promised to him by the U.S. and others in the West . Monitor contributor William Blakemore reports from Beirut : The Soviet Union , which has been maintaining a very low profile in the Lebanese civil war , is beginning to react diplomatically to the apparently cooperative efforts by the U.S. and Syria to end the fighting here . Beirut 's independent daily Al-Nahar reports the imminent arrival in Syria of a ranking Soviet diplomat , while a pro-Iraq newspaper reports that three Soviet officials have already arrived in the Syrian capital " to warn Syrian leaders of the danger of slipping into American schemes . " Most Lebanese newspapers Wednesday also took note of the U.S. Defense Department announcement that the aircraft carrier Saratoga was moving to join the nine U.S. warships , including four destroyers , already in the Eastern Mediterranean not far from Lebanon , ostensibly to evacuate Americans if needed . Some observers speculate that the arrival of the Saratoga may be intended to apply carefully measured political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lebanese crisis . There is still no sign , however , that any of the super-powers involved is trying to sabotage attempts to end the Lebanese fighting .
