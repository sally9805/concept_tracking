During a study of air pollution in 1968 , two researchers using an electron microscope at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell , England spotted strange polyhedron-shaped particles , each only .00002 inches across . Uncertain whether they were looking at a new form of life or merely a speck of soot , the scientists spent a year trying to identify the airborne organisms . They enlisted the aid of a dozen outside research institutes . Last November , still unable to identify their discovery , they described it in a paper published in Nature , and asked the world 's biological community to help solve the puzzle . <P> The correct solution was sent in by four different scientists , including Insect Physiologist David Smith of the University of Miami . " These structures , " he explained , " are brochosomes , bizarre excretory products of the Malpighian tubules of leaf hoppers . " In other words , Harwell 's UFOs are insect droppings.
