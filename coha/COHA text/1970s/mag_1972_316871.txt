In the tradition of the electric toothbrush and the high-speed electric cocktail mixer , the latest effort-saving gadget is the Name Caller , which does away with the need of dialing a telephone . By pressing a button on the device , which can be easily attached to the phone , a user can reach any one of 38 numbers . Besides its speed and convenience , the Name Caller provides a foolproof way for a baby sitter to phone police , firemen or the family doctor in an emergency . The gadget-about the size of a small bathroom scale-has been available for only four months in seven major markets , including New York City and Los Angeles , and already more than 50,000 have been sold at prices from $50 to $60 . <P> The device is made by Macom Products Corp. , a firm that was started in August . Its founder and chief , Howard Mercer , 29 , a former ski instructor and disk jockey , teamed up with two Mattel toy executives and designed the device . From August through October , Macom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Big Hang-Up . Macom has run afoul of the telephone companies . American Telephone &; Telegraph has long contended that no devices can be attached to phones unless A T &; T approves and uses its own servicemen to connect them . Usually this involves not only an installation fee but also monthly payments to the local telephone company for use of a " foreign " attachment on its equipment . The phone companies contend that unapproved devices could foul up switching systems , leading to overlapping conversations and perhaps even injuring repairmen . <P> Newspaper ads and television commercials make it clear that the Name Caller links directly into the switching systems . A user can hook up the device by opening his phone box with a screw driver and connecting a couple of wires . With an IBM electrographic marker , the user records phone numbers on a revolving belt inside the machine in much the same fashion as high school students black out answers to a computerized test . As many as 38 phone numbers can be programmed onto the belt ; later , any of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting afresh . To dial a number , the user moves a pointer to a name on the selector panel and pushes a button . Inside the machine a computer-like sensing device scans the markings made on the belt and dials the correct number . <P> Though A T &; T has not declared whether the Name Caller can really interfere with its circuits , a subsidiary , Pacific Telephone &; Telegraph Co. , sent letters to eleven stores asserting that they were violating phone-use rules by improperly advertising the device . Last month Mercer filed suit in federal district court in Los Angeles , charging that A T &; T , General Telephone &; Electronics Corp . and 41 of their subsidiaries violated antitrust laws by attempting to use Federal Communications Commission regulations to force the Name Caller off the market . The suit also contends that the telephone companies threatened to suspend the phone service of retailers if they continued to sell the device . Indeed , the telephone companies can legally shut off service to any phone user who hooks up a device himself .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
