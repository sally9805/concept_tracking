txt Solid lines of fuming cars stretched back through the curling streets of Dover out onto the open road and back six or seven miles to Shepherd 's Well . At Dover docks there was chaos . All the normal rules about loading ferries were jettisoned . Officialdom more or less threw its hand in . It was every man for himself . But in this case it was not the dock strike that had caused this weekend welter . It was the boom . Behind the daunting array of difficulties that this country faces , prosperity is waiting to be let out . It would be wrong to underestimate these difficulties . There is less than one week 's imported feed left for Britain 's livestock . Many small farm enterprises , and many small firms , face ruin . Chide deal was threatened Inflation is rampant . The rate of rise of pay increases , brought down to 8 percent , has abruptly forced its way up again to 11.4 percent . In industrial relations the concept of law is challenged . // *Dangers , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upper Clyde the determination to stick to British union traditions brought the , greatest deal the Clyde has known to the very verge of failure . Marathon , the American oil-rig firm that could make workers at Clydebank into about the best-paid and most secure men in Britian , had to give this Monday as a final deadline for an agreement with the 14 Btitish unions ivolved ? or else . At a mass meeting Friday , Clydebank workers voted unanimously in the nick of time to accept Marathon 's proposed four-year labor agreement Among the striking dockers the greatest fear is of unemployment . And deservedly so as their jobs dry up . And yet the seven-mile queue to Dover is proof of the sheer force behind the boom in the background . Auto demand rampant So many people here now have the means to get in the car and-drive off south into the sunshine that even all the ferries and all the fast hovercraft from all the ports from Ramsgate to Southampton just ca n't cope with the rush if and when the mood takes the British to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . And so abruptly has the demand for cars soared in the past six months that the British automobile industry itself ca n't fulfill.it . The Confederation of British Industry 's - latest survey of business trends and opinion shows that new orders , new investment in plant and buildings , and actual production in general throughout the industry all are rising in response to demand . There 's markedly more optimism among businessmen . The - survey was taken before the dock strike . Many industrialists also express considerable reservations about both industrial relations and inflation , particularly inflation . Retail sales rising But retail sales are rising . Consumer spending is increasing . The country 's annual growth rate ? although hard to calculate because the coal and rail strikes , and America 's dock strike , too , have jumbled up some of the figures ? is put by experts at 5 percent . This is twice the average from 1948 to ' 71 . Great Britain 's " invisible exports " still are rising . Finance , insurance , brokerage , marketing , tourism , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound has stopped much speculation . Britain 's payments remain in strong surplus . Nobody should discount the serious threats that exist to the nation 's social and political fabric . Inflation at 10 percent a year repre-sents a greater danger even than union defiance of the law . But danger does n't describe the whole scene . There 's also a boom , man . There 's also a boom .
