txt President Nixon submitted to Congress today a record $301.4 billion budget for fiscal 1975 , which he said would " support high employment while restraining inflation . " The keynote of the budget , however , was flexibility . The President said he would undertake further federal spending , if needed , if the energy crisis threatens the jobs of too many Americans . " President Nixon will not tolerate a recession , " said Frederic Malek , deputy budget director . " If it means busting the budget , he will bust the budget to keep people from losing their jobs . " IN BRIEF remark s , while signing two summaries of the budget , Nixon said it was " outstanding for two reasons . " He said " It 's not inflationary " Budget75 and is expansionary , providing funds for new initiatives , while retaining flexibility to deal with any downturn in the economy . " This is a budget which will fight inflation and one that will be antirecessionary , " the President asserted during the ceremony in the White House Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is sound and sensible . " Almost immediately , the Department of Housing and Urban Development disclosed plans to provide rent subsidies for tenants in an additional 118,000 public housing units , an increase of more than 50 per cent from the 211,000 units provided in the budget . Altho the dollar amount is relatively small , it could provide stimulus to the depressed housing industry and is an example of how the administration intends to avert a recession . AS PREVIOUSLY reported , the federal budget for the year beginning next AII3 ' 1 anticipates a deficit of at least $9.4 billion . Overall spending would be increased by nearly $30 billion from fiscal 1979 . Nixon emphasized that about 90 per cent of the increased outlays represents higher spending built into current law . Defense spending would total $85.6 billion , up $6.3 billion from the current fiscal year . And for the first time in history , federal income security payments  --  basically Social Security , public assistance and services , and other retirement and social insurance programs ? will exceed $100 billion . Except for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies from profiteering on the energy shortage , Nixon recommended no new taxes . If adopted by Congress , the windfall profits tax would bring in about $3 billion in fiscal 1975 . In addition , he urged Congress to adopt the tax reform and simplification program he submitted last year . Unlike the tough , restrictive budget of a year ago in which the President concentrated on eliminating or cutting back dozens of programs in an effort to old the line on prices , the central theme of the new budget is preventing a recession induced by the fuel shortEge . THE BUDGET contains the previously announced $1.5 billion for energy research and development as part of " Project Independence , " and new funds for mass transit systems , including a major shift in policy to permit state and Budget75 local governments to use mass transit funds for operating subsidies . Nixon said his budget , which amounts to spending nearly $1,500 for every man , woman , and child in the country , is tantamount to an economic tight rope in that federal spending increases are held to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic slowdown threatens a socially  --  and politically  --  unacceptable level of unemployment . Budget bureau officials have developed a number of contingency plans to stimulate the economy , including accelerated spending for federal construction or procurement , tax relief , and public service jobs . Malek told newsmen the administration is prepared to increase federal spending from $1 qillion to $5 billion more to prevent a recession . However , he said , " We do n't expect to have to use these stimuli . We believe we have a good budget . " If such stimulation is needed , Malek said , the administration will look first to those programs that would not require legislative action . He cited the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act as an example . Local government agencies could at their option shift the emphasis of the program into providing public service jobs for areas with high unemployment . THE PRESIDENT 'S new spending program reflects to a large extent the effects of inflation as well as the energy shortages . Government , like consumers , will be paying higher prices for fuel for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million for higher military fuel costs . Wage and price increases account for more than half the $6.3 billion increase in the defense budget . The remainder of the funds will be used to begin development of new weapons systems and to remunitions and equipment depleted during the Arab-Israeli war and in military assistance to South Viet Nam under the Paris peace agreement . Once again the administration is seeking authority to eliminate spending under the H i 1 1 - Burton Act , contending that the United States has more hospital rooms than it needs . Oter spending reductions proposed in the budget include federal aid to impacted school districts , and a $1.3 billion cut in agriculture and rural development programs . Part of this reduction reflects lower commodity subsidies payments and the sale of rural housing assets , mainly mortgages .
