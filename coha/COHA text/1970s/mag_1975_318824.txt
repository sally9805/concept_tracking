Does religious fervor lead to a richer sex life ? Maybe so . Redbook magazine 's September issue reports on a computer analysis of 18,349 responses to a professionally prepared questionnaire on sexual attitudes and practices published in the magazine last fall . While scarcely representative of all American women-most of the responses came from young , white , middle-class mothers-the survey does show that " strongly religious " women report more sexual satisfaction , more orgasms and better communication with their husbands than " fairly religious " women . At the bottom of the happiness scale are non-religious women ; they are the least satisfied with the frequency and quality of intercourse , and the least likely to take an active role in lovemaking . Redbook editors admit to being " astounded " by the correlation between religion and successful lovemaking . The magazine 's theory is that more and more " enlightened " clergymen have been teaching that sexual pleasure is " a necessary element in a good marriage . " <P> Among the survey 's other findings : 80% of the women questioned and 90% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty percent have had intercourse " often " or " occasionally " while under the influence of marijuana , and 61% of these said that they enjoyed it that way . Nearly all women-89%-have experienced oral sex . Close to one-third of all married women , and half of those who have jobs , have had extramarital affairs . Less than 4% have participated in mate swapping , but 24% say they would like to . Redbook says that the survey shows women rejecting the sexual double standard , but one response indicates that the old D.S. is still alive and kicking hard : while only 12% of the women would object to a son 's having premarital intercourse , 24% would oppose it for their daughters .
