txt Letters to the Editor pg . 17 Letters to the Editor Of West Point and Honor CUNY in Trouble To the Editor : There can be no question that the strictures of the Honor Code at West Point will be variously interpreted by each individual and that the general condition of the honor system will be a reflection of the attitudes of the cadet population as a whole To suggest that the pressures of the academic or disciplinary systems are the principal causes of the breakdown of the Honor Code is not a tenable argument . The scandal enveloped the second class , not the fourth ( plebe or freshman ) class . The second class has traditionally had the easiest time under the disciplinary system . In the past dismissal or resignation for Honor Code violation has been most serious since the discharge was usually unaccompanied by specifications ? e.g. , the discharge was for other than honorable conditions . In most cases , if a cadet was accused of violating the Honor Code , he was given a non-judicial hearing by the Honor Committee where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used against him . The accused could appeal to the superintendent for the institution of juridical proceedings where his legal rights were protected . It is possible that judicial review will modify the penalties ordained by ? the code without having to resort to special adjudications as to the degrees of guilt . But if we impose a judicial process in place of the code , the concept of honor as a guiding principle for cadet behavior will cease to exist . In reality , the purpose of the code is to promote trust among officers , and cadets through an unequivocal commitment to honorable behavior . It 's difficult  --  perhaps impossible  --  to distinguish shadings of malfeasance . If there is a weakness in the system , it is due to the inability to relate Needless Subway Link To the Editor : David L. Yunich , chairman of M.T.A. , complains that starting construction on a portion of the 63d Street subway line , from Sunnyside to Woodside , is in doubt because the Federal Government has lowered its contribution from $200 million to $160 million a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowers its contribution even further , so that the 63d Street Queens line has to be given up completely . It is not needed . Ridership on the existing E and F trains has declined steadily since 1962 . It is regrettable that the portions already built , the tunnels under Central Park and under the East River , will be wasted , but it is better to admit you goofed and get out than to continue stubbornly just because part of the work is done . JESSE BRYANT New York , June 6 , 1976 Landlords on ' Welfare ' To the Editor : The argument advanced by Arthur J. Morgan in his May 24 letter begs to be followed to its logical conclusion . He reasons that the tenant , who pays his monthly rental in advance to his landlord , is a middle-class welfare recipient because our laws prevent the landlord from exacting a 100 percent or greater increase in rentals . The true welfare recipient , then , is the high-class landlord who , while collecting his real-estate taxes in advance as part of his rent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial " School Bus Safety " was very one-sided . We would like to present another side , which is rarely , if ever , discussed in this type of tragedy . My husband is a former associate manager of a privately owned school-bus company , and I am a former school-bus driver . First : School buses are designed to hold 44 adult passengers or 66 children . In this case there were 53 passengers , who , with the exception of the two adults and the driver , were close to adult size in terms of seating arrangements . In every charter that I have ever been involved , it . is the school district that orders the number of buses needed for that particular job . The school is responsible for overloading this bus , possibly for costcutting benefits . Had two buses been used , this accident would probably not have happened . When an overloaded school bus goes into a sharp turn , the passengers shift to one side , thereby making the bus virtually unmanageable . If there is excessive speed , this is transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " presumptive evidence " that the bus was 26 years old . Recently it has been shown that the bus had faulty brakes . honorable with moral behavior . The apparent contradictions whereby a cadet demonstrates high morality by admitting to an infraction of the Honor Code only to suffer the same penalty as one caught red-handed is an implicit quality of the system . Yet can we impose an ideal standard on behavior and equivocate in our judgment as to what constitutes a breach of that standard ? I do n't think that we can accommodate ourselves to a sliding scale of honor . The failures in military behavior which led to the My Lai cover-up demonstrates that honor is a binary entity ? it either does or does not exist . The imposition of a sliding scale of penalties , on the other hand , is a matter for serious and cautious debate and continuous review . IRVING A. LERCH U.S.M.A. Class of 1960 New York , June 2 , 1976 To the Editor : Lieut . Gen. James R. Allen was quoted in The Times of June 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor code , then one would be asserting that lying , cheating and stealing are acceptable behavior . . . . " This extraordinary judgment flies in the face of bath logic and observable fact . No group of students in civilian life feels that lying , cheating and stealing are acceptable behavior  --  and they have no honor code forced upon them . The general 's statement really says that if the plebes need an honor code to tell right from wrong , their instruction leaves much to be desired . The statement is more revealing of the military mind than that of the general who , shaking his head , muttered , ' ' All those civilians out there and no one in charge . " JOHN R. MCGINLEY JR . New York , June 4 , 1976 fails to pay such taxes to the city , to the tune of current arrearages of some $500 million , which unjustly enrich him while bankrupting the city . And while he can proceed in court against a tenant who fails to pay his rent in advance , he remains behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is welfare . MARGARET FROMM New York , May 3U , 1976 The Moon Attraction To the Editor : I am writing in response to your recent news article about the Rev. Sun Myung Moon . Is the popularity of Moon 's Unification Church a bizarre aberration or an age-appropriate response to an adolescent developmental crisis ? Moon fosters a repudiation of parental ties , a most appealing proposition to the average teen-ager . Simultaneously , his organization functions in loco parentis , demanding complete obedience to norms established by older group members who shepherd the initiates through a series of membership rites . Strict rules of conduct are established . Monastic asceticism on a quasi-intellectual base is a life style in synchrony with the usual adolescent coping mechanisms . The alarm over Moon 's brainwashing and programming techniques may be excessive . The teen-agers ' response to Moon 's pronouncements is consistent with other counterculture manifestations . R. CHRISTOPHER STUCKY , M.D. Assistant Professor of Psychiatry , Rutgers Medical School Piscataway , N.J. , June 3 , 1976 Unsafe But does this mean that old equipment is not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility of the bus company to keep this bus in perfect working condition despite the fact that it was 26 years old . Third : You attributed the driving record of the driver as part of your presumptive evidence of insufficient safety precautions . Is every citizen who receives a traffic violation an incompetent driver ? A driver 's license will list all moving violations , ranging from running an obstructed stop sign to D.W.I. This does not say that any of these violations occurred while driving a school bus , and so quickly to malign someone , such as the driver in this case , is a gross injustice . ' this is not to say that privately owned school-bus companies could not be improved . However , they should not have to bear the brunt of any public outcry for greater school bus safety . It is wise to remember the school officials who , in their attempts to hold down expenditures  --  and there ? by property taxes  --  often sacrifice safety in the name of finance . CATHERINE HYLAND O'NEILL Canton , N. Y. , May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free tuition at City College leaves me angry and saddened . And it makes me even more grateful than ever that a free City College was available for me in the thirties . When I graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School , I had no probMite Hess lern deciding what college to attend . Either I made it into C.C.N.Y. or I did n't go . My family 's economic situation provided no other choice . And after the first two years , my continued attendance depended upon a 515-per-month income from a job with the Federal Emergency Relief Administration . If it had not been for those thirty hours of work in the library I would not have had the subway fare ( even at 5 cents a ride ) or the 15 cents for lunch each day . I have always felt uncomfortable about assertions that education thus made possible gives the recipient the ability to repay society for its largesse ? either in better citizenship or in higher income taxes . For me it is stgficient to believe -- as I do sincere1V -- that that education made me a fuller person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and a nation that made this possible . I can only hope that I have in fact paid them back . ? To the Editor : The Times merits praise for recognizing that the closing of CUNY shortly before final examinations was an act of callousness toward students ( editorial June 7 ) , However , The Times should be aware that the callousness is primarily not of politicians but of school administrators who either have made no statement concerning the rescheduling of finals or have announced their intention of administering them on the day after CUNY reopens , whenever that may be . Several years ago , when CUNY was closed owing to student unrest , it was decided that a student might elect to be graded on the basis of work completed , be assigned a grade of " P " or , in cases where a teacher felt he could not pass a student , be given no credit without penalty . Thus there is ample precedent for canceling final examinations under-the present circumstances , and not to do so in the name of upholding academic standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , June 7 , 1976 ? To the Editor : A news article in the June 1 issue of The Times regarding the financial problems at CUNY clearly illustrates the university chancellor 's complete lack of sensitivity to and regard for the faculty . Dr. Kibbee is quoted as saying , regarding the financial impact on the faculty by closing the university , " It is illegal ' to pay people for work they have not done . " What the chancellor seems to overlook is that CUNY faculty are paid over a twelvemonth period for the nine-month academic year . ( Almost every other institution in the country pays its faculty on a nine-month basis . ) Therefore , ithe monies being denied the CUNY faculty through furlough or school closure or whatever are monies already earned but deferred in payment . In a more recent issue of this paper the chancellor , the Mayor and legislators express concern over the- political impact of the tuition and state-funding issues on their own careers . While they play games and consume time . 18,000 faculty and staff are without their May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters those monies have been earned and should be released while the political issues are resolved . Mortgage companies , rental agents and grocery stores still require cash ; the faculty and staff have a right- to their monies now . R. KEITH MARTIN Professor of Accountancy Baruch College New York , June 4 , 1976 What Makes a School Bus 4 " Of course times have ** course there are some new , perhaps even better , ways - to help Americans get higher education . And yet I am angry and saddened to see this abrupt termination of a magnificent program as the result of financial difficulties , the victim of a city in crisis . How tragic that we have failed to arrange our private and public priorities- to have to come to this . HYMAN BOOKBINDER Washington , June 3 , 1976 ?
