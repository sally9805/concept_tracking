RICHARD NIXON SPEAKS HIS MIND Like a retired quarterback now sidelined to spectator status , R.N. still follows the action and delights in offering insights on the game that beat him . by Nick Thimmesch Richard Milhous Nixon is the most durable public figure of our time . His friends and enemies agree on that , if not on his worth and place in our society . Indeed , his record of taking stands on controversial issues gives him staying power in the public arena , which consumes scores of blander men and women . After Watergate many believed that we had heard the last from this man , although he was the thirty-seventh President , and thus assured a place in history . But Nixon , in his 60 's and full of spirit and curiosity , eventually broke out of the seclusion of his San Clemente home . He emerged through the David Frost interviews , then by means of his published memoirs , and more recently through generally successful appearances in Europe . The friendly , respectful reception he experienced through his appearance on French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Oxford ( despite catcalls from demonstrators outside ) , put Nixon back in the news . Many a seasoned observer reflected that here is a man who : was in the public limelight through the anti-Communist and Cold War era of the ' 50 's and ' 60 's ; took unpopular stands against demonstrators and antiwar protestors in the turbulent Vietnam period ; engaged in lively bat-des with Congress over spending and social issues ; crafted new approaches to our traditional Communist adversaries , the Soviet Union and the Peoples Republic of China ; established a new atmosphere in relations between Israel and her neighboring adversary Arab states ; and became the first President in history forced out ofoffice by a scandal  --  Watergate . That 's quite a plateful . It is not remarkable that a recent survey showed that 39 percent of the American people believes that Nixon should play some role in American public life . Watergate aside , Nixon left other marks on our society and the workings of government . The U.S. now lives with a new , more relaxed relationship with the Soviets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through their final stages of integration in the Nixon years , not through the acrimony of fund cutoffs and public admonition , but through counseling and the courts . There is anew focus on the decentralization of federal power and a return of tax funds to the states through revenue sharing . And four of the nine members of the U.S. Supreme Court are Nixon appointees , i.e. , the so-called " Nixon court . " Interestingly enough those in the creative field who are not Nixon fans reluctantly admit that Nixon did more to fund the arts and humanities than any other President . At age 66 Nixon seems healthy and vigorous . His daughter , Julie Eisenhower , made him a grandfather last year . His other daughter , Tricia , is also an expectant mother ; so by 1979 he 'll be a grandfather twice . Nixon is now busy writing a second book and promises that he will speak out on public issues when he thinks it will serve the nation 's interest . Shortly after he returned from his European trip in December , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in his suite at the Waldorf Towers in New York City . It was clear that he had indeed returned to public life  --  through the back doors of Paris and England  --  because the pundits and commentators reacted as though they had rediscovered him . Watergate was not uppermost in his mind when I interviewed him that afternoon at the Waldorf . He was more interested in the warm response he got in Europe , the congratulatory messages he received , reports on the big audience he drew on public television , and in reasserting the combative spirit that saw him through political wars back to President Truman 's time . " A man is not finished when he is defeated , " he told me . " He is finished when he quits . My philosophy is that no matter how many times you are knocked down , you get off that floor , even if you are bloody , battered , and beaten , and just keep slugging  --  providing you have something to live for . " If you have something you believe in , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are standing but when you are down on that floor . You 've got to get up and start banging again . When I study men and women leaders in history , those I admire the most are those who have gone through adversity and have come back . You 've got to learn to survive a defeat . That 's when you develop character . " Nixon made it clear that debate is his meat and taking a stand his strong drink . " I just do n't like sitting on my fanny at San Clemente or playing golf to take up my time , " he said . " Some people wait to retire in Palm Springs or Palm Beach or Leisure World . They play golf , go fishing , or play bridge . " All that bores me to death , and so do cocktail parties . I hope I never have to go to another cocktail party as long as I live . I do n't like dinners , and fortunately , my wife does n't either . When you have been to the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Peking or Paris  --  what the h ? do we want to go to a dinner on Park Avenue for ? Why ? No way ! " The point is that once an individual believes that the whole purpose in life is to earn and succeed so that he can retire gracefully and go to pasture , well , believe me , he is n't going to lead a productive life . It is so tempting to get out of the eye of the hurricane . " For me , taking a stand , particularly on issues that affect world peace , is living . " In Europe , Nixon declared that " my political life is over . " When he said this in England , the demonstrators outside at Oxford let loose with a loud cheer . There were concurrent murmurs of relief among professional Republicans in Washington who thought , Good Lord , could he want to get back in politics ? So , while he 's out of politics , which seems sensible for a man central to Watergate , that does n't mean Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over into his future public statements , however " nonpolitical . " " Being controversial in politics is inevitable , " he told me in a philosophical moment . " If an individual wants to be a leader and is n't controversial , that means he never stood for anything . In the world today there are not many good choices  --  only choices between the half-good and the less half-good . " If a leader does n't stand up on a great issue , he 's not going to be great . If he does stand up , he will be controversial . The mark of leadership is not how a leader can take a popular position and ride with it , like a poll or congressional sentiment . The real test is to takethe unpopular position , if he thinks it is right , and make it popular . " Edmund Burke said a half-dozen grasshoppers can make a terrible racket while a thousand cows silently chew their cud . Do n't make the mistake , Burke said , of thinking those who make the most noise are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burke quote on grasshoppers and cows , as it appears in Bartlett 's Quotations , is longer and more eloquent , but Nixon captured the essence . ) Though he declared at Oxford , " I am not going to keep my mouth shut , " Nixon refrains from detailed discussion or direct quotation on several tough issues with which President Carter wrestles  --  relations with the Soviets , the SALT negotiations , and the Middle East peace settlement . Nixon still believes that balance-of-power strategy is the best Continued on page 106 . Nixon continued from page 66 way to deal with the Soviets , that while the Soviets do not want war , they will take advantage of American weaknesses to engage in adventurous policies without fear of retaliation , and therefore the United States could suffer a defeat without war . The remedy , by his thinking , is to maintain military superiority over the Soviets and not to allow them to limit U.S. options to a nuclear response causing the mass destruction of civilians . A SALT agreement that only maintains instability is a danger , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . As for the Middle East , Nixon thinks the removal of Egypt as a military threat to Israel ends the possibility of a significant war in that region . But the Palestinian problem remains , and he believes it is in Israel 's best interest to be as generous as possible on the West Bank question in order to protect Egyptian President Anwar Sadat 's position in the rest of the Arab world . In any case , Nixon thinks , the Soviets must be kept out of the Middle East , Israel must be kept strong enough to defend itself , the United States should stay friendly with Israel 's Arab neighbors so the Soviets ca n't move in , and Sadat must be kept in power as a guarantee to future stability . He is less restrained in commenting on " human rights . " In characteristic form , Nixon says , " I applaud Mr. Carter 's fine rhetoric on human rights " and then proceeds to raise questions . " Did anybody suggest that Saudi Arabia is not an absolute monarchy , " he asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Khalid or Prince Fand , ' Look , boys , until you unveil the women  --  the Shah of Iran has already done that  --  we wo n't buy your oil ? ' H  --  no ! " We can criticize , but the bottom line is to keep friends of the United States . I do n't approve of kicking our friends in public , like the Argentinians and the Brazilians . The Latins are proud , and they 're going to tell us , Up yours . ' " Where are the human rights in China ? Are we going to change our policy on China because they do n't have human rights ? H ? no ! " On this question , there are no good choices in the world . The Shah is authoritarian , but we do n't want to lose the Shah . In Manila , Marcos has a d  --  military government , but do you want Communism out there ? Those are authoritarian states , but they do n't threaten their neighbors and they are our friends . Totalitarian Communist states do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The same distinction must be drawn , Nixon says , in terms of what South Vietnam was and what Communist Vietnam is today . He says that while South Vietnam was not wholly democratic and had corruption , there were 17 newspapers , dissent , political opposition . Now there are concentration camps , no dissent , no political opposition , and one newspaper  --  that of the Communist regime . " Look at this situation concerning the move to deport General Loan , " he says . " Why do n't people get more het up about what Communist Vietnam is doing to its own people , letting them starve on those boats ? It was Lenin who said that refugees are people who vote with their feet , and that still holds . " When it came to atrocities in the Vietnam war , yes , there were atrocities in the South , including My Lai . But two wrongs make two wrongs . The atrocities in the South were brought on by atrocities by the North , which were infinitely worse , on a magnitude of ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Loan case in saying it is ridiculous and that the man should n't be deported . The Immigration and Naturalization Service is wrong . I could n't agree with Carter more . Good for him . " If Nixon is restrained on Carter , and occasionally even praises him , he is outright warm and admiring of the late Senator Hubert Humphrey . Nixon and Humphrey developed a friendship via long-distance phone in the last two years of Humphrey 's life . " Hubert was always good to me , " Nixon recalled . " As he approached the end , he was sympathetic to me , I guess because I had been sick , too , and all that crap . " In December 1976 Humphrey , while recuperating in his Waverly , Minnesota , home from the enormous surgery which removed his cancer-ridden bladder , told me : " Nixon was always respectful with me . He went out of his way to be so . When we left Washington after his inauguration , he sent us home in the Presidential plane and with our household goods aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was recovering from my surgery . " Nixon now recalls : " When he left Washington in 1969 I gave him the Air Force One backup plane and Secret Service protection for six months . Lyndon Johnson objected to all that , I do n't know why . He did n't object as a personal matter . He just said it was n't good precedent . " One reason I did it was that when I was in the unusual position of being a Vice President who had run for President and lost in a close election 1960 , I had no transportation home , no Secret Service , no nothing , not even a pension ( Vice Presidents now get federal pensions ) . I knew what Hubert was going through , and I wanted to make it easier on him . " Hubert was a man who had many people disagreeing with him , but he had no enemies . Hubert was just a guy you liked . He could say outrageous things . He kicked the ? out of me in 1968 . He went around shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . Hubert was n't like McGovern , bitter and vicious and all that . It was just good old Hubert on the stump . " I had Hubert down to the White House as often as I could , and I had Barry Goldwater down there , too . But the d ? Republican leadership , and the Democratic leadership , too , bitched about it . They did n't want those guys down there because they were n't the leadership . Was n't that terrible ? They should have wanted them down there for every meeting ! " Anyway , Humphrey remembered Nixon by phoning him in 1976 to wish him Merry Christmas and even called him on his birthday , January 9 , 1978 , when Humphrey was only four days from death . Muriel Humphrey recalls that she thinks Nixon 's voice broke on both occasions while her husband spoke with him . There was a stir and some sniping when Nixon came to Humphrey 's funeral service in the Capitol Rotunda . It was Nixon 's first visit to Washington since he resigned in disgrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . She once told me : " I made that decision easily . Hubert and he had been in touch with one another off and on , particularly on special occasions . I was very pleased when I learned that President Nixon was coming to the funeral . It gave some healing to him and Pat . " The Nixon-Humphrey relationship says more about Humphrey 's live-andlet-live philosophy than it does about Nixon 's views of adversaries . Nixon still harbors strong and resentful feelings about many of those he regards as enemies , including the press . " The press is going to be the same toward me , and I do n't mind , " he told me . " The press was in an adversary relationship long before I became President . " I beat them too many times . I beat them on the Hiss case . I beat them on the fund controversy 1952 , and I beat them when I came back and won the Presidency . They have never been for me . " They do n't agree with me . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported me on the China initiative , but for the wrong reasons . Theyjust did n't understand what it was all about . " He laughed at this point and said , " They thought I had finally seen the light and felt that Communism was n't all that bad . How naive . " There 's nothing personal in my feelings about the press . It 's part of life . That 's the way it has been , and that 's the way it will be . Oh , in 1968 I got good press for a while , because they were trying to kick Johnson in the a ? . As soon as Hubert gave his Dove speech in Salt Lake City , the press went very strong against me , particularly television . " The writing press is much fairer than the television press , which has no balance whatsoever . You can not name a top television commentator employed by one of the three big networks who is on the conservative side . Oh , Howard K. Smith of ABC is conservative on foreign policy issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another ? " The writing press will stick the hook in you now and then , but they sort of feel that they have to live with you , and after they think about it , they are fairer . " The television press is far overpaid . That 's one reason I admire people who stick in the writing press . What the h ? , they are n't in it for the money but because they feel they are contributing something . It 's life to them . " After 32 years of contention , of fighting with those he regards as enemies , of being in the thick of politics nearly all this time , Nixon has a record of accomplishment as well as failure . The record will always show that he was the first President forced to resign from office due to scandal . He admits he " screwed up " on Watergate and claims , " I paid the price . " No one , including his most vehement opponents , ever denied that this man was blessed with a first-class mind and an unsurpassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mind and the power that came to him in elective politics is the judgment history will make . Now , as he makes obvious moves to restore his reputation and to enter again the arena of disputation , Nixon reminds us how durable he has been in our lifetime . He is still feisty , even belligerent , about what it means to get into that arena and survive . " After this last election , " he said , " I wrote to some of the guys who lost , and I told them I won some and I lost some , and winning is more fun . When you win , you hear from everyone . When you lose , you only hear from your friends . " In these modern days , particularly with the kind of crap they put out in the universities , life is supposed to be a Continued on following page // bowl of cherries  --  nothing but fun . But that is n't life . " For every winner , there are hundreds of losers . For everyone who is first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in terms of the human spirit and character , is for an individual to learn from losing and never accept defeat . " I am going to speak out on issues , and maybe I 'll lose some and people will tell me to shut up . But when you believe in something , as I do , particularly on peace , you must speak up . And that 's what I am going to do . " 2 . ! Happily Ever lifter continued from page 85 one-minute scene in which he played a crying , crippled soldier in With a Song in My Heart . These early roles were obtained just in time , because nearly 12 months before he had agreed to go into his father 's steel business should he be unable to break into the movies within a year . The tears shed in his early film quickly changed to smiles when Spencer Tracy requested him for two important co-starring roles in Broken Lance and The Mountain . The Detroit-born but California-raised Wagner seemed well on his way to becoming a major motion picture star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more celebrated wife . Although he was not living in Natalie 's shadow , many chose to place him there . Accordingly , he had to forge an identity of his own in addition to establishing a career . When the marriage ended , he took off for Europe and drifted into a performer 's purgatory where one is perpetually making the film that will finally push him over the top . The big break came in 1968 when he landed the starring role in the immensely popular series " It Takes a Thief . " His name and face became among television 's most easily recognizable . In 1969 , about the same time " Thief " neared the top of the Nielson ratings , Natalie announced her semiretirement from acting just after the release of Bob &; Carol &; Ted &; Alice . " I thought I had finally put my time in , " she explains . " I had been acting for 25 years , and I felt it was time to devote myself to raising a family . " For ten years the two met only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at a 1970 Hollywood dinner party , it became obvious to both that their love was burning as strong as ever . " We talked all evening , " says Natalie . " It was bittersweet . He walked me to the car . It was raining , and he was worried about my driving home to Bel Air by myself . He said , ' Are you happy ? ' What I did n't realize was that he was at the party alone because he and his wife had just separated . " Though they did n't admit it to anyone , including themselves , from that point on each believed that somehow they would get back together . And when Natalie 's marriage to London theatrical agent Richard Gregson came to a peaceful end , the opportunity arose . They had drifted away from each other once . It could not be allowed to happen again . The couple were remarried in 1972 . Now the years of doubt , reflection , and searching are over . R. J. and Natalie have survived and survived marvelously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagners have been through it before . Theirs is a relationship strengthened by an awareness of the mistakes of the past and a determined desire to avoid making them in the future . They are basking in a security that is both personal and professional . Natalie , after 20 years of unsuccessfully combining the two , has finally found the proper blend . " There 's nothing more fascinating than watching kids grow , " she says . " And if I had another child now I think I 'd take another couple of years off , because when they 're very young I 'm not able to be away from them . But now Natasha , who 's almost eight , and Courtney , who 's almost five , do n't mind if I work . " Nat and R. J. plan their shooting schedules so one is always home , and they never go away together for more than two weeks at a time . One of these rare trips was supposed to have been an annual jaunt to Cannes for the film festival this past summer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , so all plans were cancelled . It 's not hard to tell where the Wagners ' priorities lie . " Meteor was like a test run to see if I could do both , " says Natalie . " And I found that I could . My children did n't suffer . " Today the Wagners ' personal life is a quiet one . They have tempered their celebrity with a heavy dose of successful family existence . At the helm of the couple 's 60-foot yacht , The Splendor , R. J. seems in control of both the sea and his destiny . Neither he nor Natalie has any regrets about where they have been or where they are going . After years of excessive highs and equally excessive lows , they are rejoicing in the pleasantly mundane consistency of their lives together . " I 've learned to enjoy those special moments in life instead of thinking about how to enjoy them , " says R. J. " I 'm a lucky man . " " We 're lucky people , " adds a smiling Natalie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
