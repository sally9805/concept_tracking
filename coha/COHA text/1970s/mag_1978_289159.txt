One burden of world financial power that Saudi Arabia so far has escaped is worry about the day-to-day fluctuations of its own currency . The Saudi riyal ( rhymes with gee doll ) is rarely even seen by foreign money traders , and its value essentially is fixed by the Saudis themselves-quite puzzlingly . Though the riyal has <P> been revalued upward 14 times since October 1977 , the total increase against the dollar has been only 7% , from 280 to 300 . <P> The Saudis have gained little from that , except perhaps a heightening of the aura of prestige surrounding them in international money markets . The value of the riyal in dollars does not affect its purchasing power at home , and the Saudis pay for imports and foreign investments not with riyals but with the dollars they get from oil sales . Indeed , the Saudis let few riyals out of the country ; they do not want the riyal to become an international currency , lest its value be set by speculators and other money traders . Authorities have kept the formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret . A London bank once set its computers to work trying to calculate the formula , to see whether and how it was related to the Saudis ' trading surplus or the fluctuations of the dollar against other currencies , but drew a complete blank . <P> Speculators have trouble getting hold of riyals . Some branches of European and American banks in Bahrain have attempted to float bond issues denominated in riyals in Europe . They got a stern bawling out from the Saudis for not asking permission to launch what the Saudis feared might be the beginning of a perilously unstable Euroriyal market .
