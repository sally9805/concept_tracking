With the recession deepening and economists worried about worse to come , the Remington Arms Co. is marketing a product that turns out to be both contemporary and nostalgic in its appeal . Someone at the distinguished old firearms company noticed that the calendar days and dates of 1975 exactly match those of 1930 , the year the nation 's economy really started to collapse . The current situation , of course , is no where nearly as serious . Thus no one seemed to shudder when Remington began selling a handsome replica of a 1930 calendar issued by the Peters Cartridge Co. , now a division of Remington , perhaps because of the current fascination with the entire decade of the ' 30s . For instance , art deco will again be all the rage in 1975 , just as it was in 1930 , and escapist movies are making a comeback . So far , Remington has sold 8,000 copies of its calendar at $4 each , and orders are still coming in for the vintage specimen that bears a grand magazine-art painting of a hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depression buff who used to have everything .
