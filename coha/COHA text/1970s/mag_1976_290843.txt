" Jewish radar sets are up all over , sensing a new political configuration , " declares Chicago Financier Maynard Wishner , a leader of the city 's Jewish community . What those radars are picking up , of course , is the orbiting presidential candidacy of Jimmy Carter . How America 's Jews are going to respond to him has been of concern for Carter campaign strategists . They are troubled by the specter of 1972 , when Jews-like other traditional Democrats-deserted Democratic Presidential Nominee George McGovern in droves . Instead of polling over 80% of the Jewish vote , as John Kennedy ( 1960 ) and Hubert Humphrey ( 1968 ) did , and 90% , as Lyndon Johnson ( 1964 ) did , McGovern cornered only around 60% . <P> Carter , in recent weeks , has mounted a determined effort to woo Jews . He has advertised heavily in Jewish publications , huddled with Jewish community notables , sent personal mailings to Jewish voters and appointed a special director for Jewish affairs . Helping him have been a number of Atlanta 's Jews ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and close relationship with Georgia 's Jewish leaders and that , as Governor , he appointed Jews to prominent state positions . <P> In some ways , the hesitations of America 's Jews toward Carter are not unique ; they represent a variation on the themes that emerged during the long primary season-a Northerner 's suspicion of a politician from the South , an apprehension about a contender lacking experience in national Government and a displeasure about what has been perceived ( however incorrectly ) as Carter 's fuzziness on specific issues . In addition , as Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg , President of the American Jewish Congress , points out : " There 's no national Jewish leader who can actually say , ' Jimmy Carter is my friend . ' " <P> One of the special issues that seem to concern Jews is Carter 's evangelical Southern Baptist faith ( see RELIGION ) . In a recent letter to Reform Jewish leaders across the nation , Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler , President of the American Union of Hebrew Congregations , recalled that " historically , anti-Semitism had its roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " is unjust and paradoxical for religious Jews to look askance at a man because he is deeply religious . " <P> Carter publicly confronted the religious issue early last week in Elizabeth , NJ . Responding to a question from a predominantly Jewish audience of 2,000 , the candidate-a blue velvet yarmulke perched atop his head-declared extemporaneously : " I worship the same God you do ; we Baptists study the same Bible that you do . This is a country wherein one 's own religious faith should not be a matter of prejudice or concern . The ability of Jews , Catholics , Baptists , even atheists to work in harmony with one another in our nation , based on a system of religious pluralism , is one that is precious to me . " Later Carter added that he opposed federal aid to parochial schools and favored the Supreme Court 's ban on religious prayer in the public schools-two stances with which the majority of U.S. Jewry concur .                   @ @
