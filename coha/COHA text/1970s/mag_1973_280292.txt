No presidential candidate ever made more use of advertising skills and techniques than Richard Nixon-or employed more former admen as top assistants after attaining office . H.R. Haldeman , Ronald Ziegler and Dwight Chapin , among others in the White House , all came from the advertising industry . Nixon 's 1968 campaign script even led to a successful book , The Selling of the President 1968 , by Joe McGinniss . It chronicled how Nixon 's media men skillfully packaged his assets - and disguised his weaknesses-to present him to the American public . <P> Last week , as John W. Dean fired away at the President and his former top assistants , McGinniss expressed doubts that any conceivable advertising campaign could resell the President . <P> " It 's a lost cause , " the writer said . " They seem to have finally p.r . ' d themselves into a corner that they ca n't p.r . themselves out of . Given his personality and given the amount of evidence that ties him to what 's been going on , it seems to me that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too deep . " <P> McGinniss 's pessimism is not shared by all advertising and public relations experts . TIME asked a number of them how they would handle the President 's account today if they had it , and what advice they would give Nixon about rebuilding his image . Excerpts from their suggestions : <P> &gt; Marion Conrad , who heads her own public relations and communications firm in San Francisco : " People forget details , but they remember a flavor . <P> This Watergate flavor will be around a long time . Nixon has so few favorable areas left , but one of them is foreign relations . He is running out of countries to visit , but he could get involved in making the U.N . truly effective . Pat is another asset . He could send her off on a trip around the country with a new cause-for example , equal opportunity for women , or for black women . " <P> &gt; Stuart Spencer , president of Spencer-Roberts &; Associates , Inc. , a Los Angeles public relations and advertising firm : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move . Of course , he could start another war , but I would n't recommend it . I would have saved the trip to China , if I knew last year about Watergate , but he still has a couple of areas left for dramatic moves , like the Mideast or inflation . " <P> &gt; Robert Pritikin , president of Pritikin &; Gibbons Communications , an advertising agency in San Francisco : <P> " Image-wise he is terribly stiff . I 'd tell him to stop walking down the beach in San Clemente in a necktie and vest . My God , does n't he ever wear a sweatshirt ? " <P> &gt; Ward Stevenson , a senior vice president of Hill &; Knowlton Inc. , public relations agency in Los Angeles : " Nixon made a bad mistake by surrounding himself with lawyers and admen . If they had been p.r . men , there would have been no Watergate coverup . We preach admitting mistakes , getting the facts out and the bad publicity behind us . I would encourage a voluntary appearance before the Senate committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
