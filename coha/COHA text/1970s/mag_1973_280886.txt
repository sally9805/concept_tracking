THE CRISIS/COVER STORY <P> In a year surfeited with surprise , in a month of successive shocks , it was by any reckoning the most tumultuous week of modern U.S. political history . <P> Richard Nixon 's survival as President was in grave doubt , and-by Nixon 's account-so was the peace of the world for a few tense hours . The foreign crisis was resolved , but the unmaking of the presidency of Richard Nixon gathered such momentum as to almost ensure even more crises in the days ahead . <P> The week was propelled through its course by public protest against the President unprecedented in its intensity and breadth . Individual Americans demanded Richard Nixon 's resignation or impeachment in 275,000 telegrams that overloaded Western Union circuits in Washington . Much of the legal profession , most of organized labor and many key religious leaders joined the assault . Nearly two dozen resolutions to at least begin impeachment proceedings were introduced in the House of Representatives . At the shocked White House , even the President 's loyal chief of staff , Alexander Haig , termed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive denunciation was directed at the President 's abrupt dismissal of Special Watergate Prosecutor Archibald Cox and the resultant departures on principle of two of the scandal-ridden Administration 's untainted remaining officials , Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus . It was aimed too at Nixon 's original refusal to turn over tapes and documents of his Watergate-related communications as ordered by a U.S. court of appeals . <P> Fixed Smile . Buckling under the massive pressure , the President once again abandoned a position that he had repeatedly proclaimed as inviolate , dramatically agreeing to yield up his long-guarded tapes . Once again turning about , he announced that a new special prosecutor would be appointed . He seemed almost eager to seize on a new crisis in the Middle East to claim his indispensability and strength , but such was the low state of his credibility that an emotional and unfortunate controversy erupted over whether he had ordered a global alert of all U.S. military units at least in part to divert attention from his own grave problems . <P> Striding with a fixed smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras and declared that he had been the victim of reporting that he assailed variously as " outrageous , vicious , distorted , frantic and hysterical " ( see Hugh Sidey on the press conference , page 23 ) . Perspiring and barely containing his anger at times , Nixon insisted that " the tougher it gets , the cooler I get . " The recent scandal-inspired shocks that have so jolted the nation " will not affect me and my doing my job , " he said . He had been through so much controversy ( " it has been my lot " ) that " when I have to face an international crisis , I 've got what it takes . " <P> He vowed that " as long as I can carry out that kind of responsibility , I 'm going to continue to do this job . " With dozens of reporters still shouting " Mr. President ! " Nixon abruptly left the podium . <P> Although the flood of protest telegrams hardly abated after the announcement that Nixon would hand over the tapes , this move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
