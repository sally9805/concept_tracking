A cartoon in Bologna 's daily Resto del Carlino recently portrayed Christian Democrat Premier Aldo Moro and Communist Party Leader Enrico Berlinguer as a cozy couple on the dance floor , while Socialist Party Chief Francesco de Martino stood alone growling " Hey , I thought this was supposed to be my dance . " Italian politics being what it is , the caricature contained more truth than humor . Making good on a long-hinted threat , the Socialist Party last week withdrew its parliamentary support for Moro 's fragile coalition government , thereby forcing the Cabinet to resign . With Italy still deep in its worst postwar recession , the country faced the grim prospects of 1 ) living with another ineffectual ( even minority ) coalition government , or 2 ) elections that could give the well-organized Communist Party a share of power . <P> Even apart from the collapse of the government , it was a week of shocks for Italians . On the day that Socialist Leader De Martino announced his party 's decision to withdraw support for the government , the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the CIA had been authorized to give $6 million in secret aid to non-Communist Italian parties-most of it , apparently , to the ruling Christian Democrats . Then , the day after Premier Moro rode to the Palazzo del Quirinale to tender his resignation to President Giovanni Leone , millions of workers walked off the job in a general strike that shut down airports , closed most government offices and schools and slowed down sectors of industry . The workers were striking in sympathy with 200,000 civil servants who were still waiting for approval of new labor contracts that expired last year . Politicians of other parties blamed the Socialists for the chaos . " With all the unemployment , all the labor contracts pending , how can the Socialists provoke early elections and bring everything to a stop ? " fumed one angry Communist official . " What a workers ' party ! " <P> Out in the Cold . The Socialists had acted to protest their increasingly powerless role in the 13-month-old Moro coalition . Always reluctant to lose protest votes by joining directly in the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Deputies , had not accepted any Cabinet posts . All the portfolios were held by Moro 's fellow Christian Democrats ( 267 seats ) and the small right-of-center Republican Party ( 14 ) . <P> But the coalition depended on Socialist votes in Parliament to give it a majority . As inflation soared and unemployment deepened in Italy-currently more than 1.2 million workers , or about 7% of the labor force-the Socialists found themselves accused of siding with the centrist parties in favor of unpopular deflationary policies . Meanwhile , Italy 's Communists , with 179 seats in the Chamber of Deputies , could take comfortable refuge in their role as the leaders of the parliamentary opposition .
