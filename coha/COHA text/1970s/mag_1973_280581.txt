EAST-WEST <P> The three-story white villa in Zu rich 's discreet residential district of Hongg is surrounded by electronic devices to detect intruders . As visitors walk from the iron gate to the front door through terraced gardens , they may notice that the burly man water ing the petunias has a revolver stuck in his jeans . They may also see a cheetah and hear the growls , if not feel the breath , of two lion-sized Great Danes . <P> In short , the house on Ackersteinstrasse seems as forbidding as the Berlin Wall . <P> It is in fact the headquarters of an organization that specializes in breaching the Wall and other Communist barri ers to help refugees escape to the West . <P> The villa is also the home of the or ganization 's leader , a hefty adventurer whose Swiss passport bears the name of Hans Lenzlinger , but who is more widely known as " the People-Smuggler of Zurich .

After the parlor ran afoul of the vice squad , he switched to the business of selling freedom . In two years , he claims , he has helped 152 East Germans , Hungarians , Czechs and Bulgarians flee to freedom . His standard fee : $10,000 a head ( though he offers reduced rates for group escapes ) . <P> Lenzlinger calls his outfit Aramco , not after the U.S.-Arabian oil company , he says , but because he likes the sound of the name . He has no monopoly on the trade . Some 20 similar organizations operate within West Germany . Like Aramco , many have advertised in newspapers , under the heading of " Family Reunification " or , more bluntly , Flucht helfer ( Escape Helper ) . Lately they have become a center of controversy . East German authorities have pressured the West German government to crack down on the impresarios of escape . They claim that Fluchthelfer activities violate the spirit of detente and abuse the terms under which East Germany agreed to relax inspections on some major transit routes between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now threatening to prosecute the escape merchants . <P> Lenzlinger views the uproar with entrepreneurial opportunism . If Bonn is making things difficult for West German escape organizations , he told TIME 'S Robert Kroon , then " someone will have to do the job . " Clearly , in Lenzlinger 's eyes , no one is better suited than himself . First , he insists , Aramco does not gouge its clients ( though many are doctors and other professionals who can expect to make large salaries in the West ) . " I have not increased my prices , in spite of inflation , " he insists . " My profit margin is only 25% . The overhead is tremendous . " <P> Not all the overhead is for staff . <P> There is also the cost of special equipment , such as vehicles fitted out with secret compartments ( " Only crude amateurs use the trunks " ) , fake uniforms and , for one highly imaginative venture , an electric minisubmarine of the type used occasionally by cigarette smugglers on the border lakes between Switzerland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with zebra skins , African spears , various weapons and the hat of an East German policeman ( Vopo ) given him by a grateful client , Lenzlinger proudly produced for Kroon purported dossiers on some of his escape exploits .
