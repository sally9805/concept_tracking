Shawn Moran , arms scratched and face caked with dust , wheeled his bike into the pits and cut his engine . He had taken a second and two thirds in races last week at Indian Dunes Park in Valencia , Calif . It had been one of his better days . " Yeah , I did O.K. , " he admitted , removing his helmet painted with four-leaf clovers and the motto : " Get it on , Shawn . " But he was tired and not very talkative . Perhaps it was because he is only eight years old . <P> Shawn is a minibiker , one of the thousands of American kids who in the past two years have embraced half-size ( or even smaller ) motorcycles , the replacement for the tricycle in the age of opulence . Recession or no , minibikes seem to be all over , but nowhere are they more visible than in Los Angeles . There , hundreds of youngsters race every week under auspices of the three local minibike associations ; there are flat-track races , others with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a cross-country scramble ) . From a distance , the riders are perfect replicas of grownup cyclists . They wear leather pants and jackets , helmets , kidney belts and boots , just like the Hell 's Angels . Their shirts advertise the various bike makes , including Honda , Yamaha and Suzuki . <P> Beefed-Up Lawnmowers . Only up close do spectators realize that everything is miniaturized . The bikes themselves , ranging from 2 h.p. to 6 h.p. , can race as fast as 45 m.p.h. and sell for from $125 to $350 . Although Japanese models dominate the market , there are plenty of domestic brands as well - about 50 manufacturers in all . Since 1967 , when the craze began , more than 2,000,000 minibikes have been sold . " It 's like the Hula-Hoop craze , " says Alfred Schiff , a cycle dealer in Vienna , Va. , " and they 're nothing more than beefed-up lawnmowers on wheels . " <P> Schiff has a point . The minibikes have no fenders , lights or horns and thus do not qualify for motor-vehicle registration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most communities . " You do n't have any protection , " says New York City Patrolman Peter Kani . " These bikes ca n't pass any kind of inspection in this state . Most kids do n't even wear helmets when they drive them . That 's why when they are injured-and many are-it 's usually serious . " Kani speaks from tragic experience . His 14-year-old son , Michael , was fatally injured last June in a minibike accident . <P> Regulated Tracks . Despite the dangers , the tiny cycles hold an undeniable fascination for youngsters . Outlawing the street use of minibikes has made little difference ; it is legal to drive them in backyards and driveways , and few kids can withstand the temptation to keep on going into the streets . <P> One answer is to build private , regulated tracks . In Mount Vernon , N.Y. , 115 members of the local minibike club ride legally for two hours every Sunday on the city 's own track . Each rider must be accompanied by a parent or guardian , must have his bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
