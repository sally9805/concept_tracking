txt His swarthy skin and foreign look set him apart from the other six defendants in the trial of the Harrisburg 7 . In journalists ' lists of the seven , he is always the " and " at the end , " six Roman Catholic nuns , priests and ex-clergy , and a Pakistani scholar . " At the beginning of jury selection , Judge R. Dixon Herman queried a room full of veniremen , " Would you be predisposed to distrust Mr. Ahmad because he is a foreigner , not a member of the white race , a Muslim ? " Two of the final jury panel have indicated their reservations about an alien taking part in protest in the United States . Seated against the wall , he frequently whispers to the Rev. Philip Berrigan and confers more often with the lawyers than the other defendants . Who is he ? He is more sophisticated and worldly m conversation than the others ; friends say he would have preferred to handle his own defense . In appearance he is slightly sinister ( an impression quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an expert on revolutionary movements and guerrilla warfare ; some think the government will argue that his master mind led the group of nonviolent clergy astray . Who is Eqbal Ahmad ? How did a Muslim academic become entangled in a trial of Catholic activists ? Dr. Ahmad himself professes astonishment at his situation . " There is not an iota of truth in the specific charges , " he says in his precise British accent . // *Berrigan case mystery man : Ahmad ( The first count is conspiracy to destroy draft files , blow up heating tunnels under federal buildings in Washington , D.C. , and kidnap presidential aide Henry A. Kissinger . ) Before the first indictment , the scholar was pursuing his study of " third world " revolutionary movement as a fellow at the Adlai Stevenson Institute of International Affairs in Chicago and editing Afrasia , a French news magazine about third-world affairs . He arrived in this country on a Fulbright grant in 1957 and got his Ph.D . with highest honors from Princeton in 1965 . Sharing described His link to the defendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother of the accused , whom he met at Cornell University in 1967 . The priest , already becoming known as an activist was the cochairman of a campus religious organization and Mr. Ahmad was teaching political science . " We shared a lot of things , " reminisced Dr. Ahmad with a mischievous grin , " we both liked cooking , we both loved poetry , and we were both very much against the war . " Dr. Ahmad met Philip Berrigan a few times through his brother . " But we had no real relationship at all until the indictment . " Of the other five defendants , he knew only Sister Elizabeth McAlister " fairly well " before the indictment , and " two , I 'd never met at all . " Dr. Ahmad is said to have taken no part in any of the various raids conducted by members of the Catholic Left ( the government appears to be centering its case on proving conspiracy to destroy draft files ) . The government indicates in its indictment that the alleged plot to kidnap Dr. Kissinger was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Aug. 17th , 1970 , " by Dr. Ahmad . In two letters attached to the second indictment , which the defendant has never denied are authentic , Sister Elizabeth wrote to Father Philip of a meeting at which " Eq outlined a plan for . . . " a " citizen 's arrest " of Dr. Kissinger . She asked Father Philip 's advice ; his reply was enthusiastic with some sharp reservations about Dr. Ahmad 's capabilities for action . ( He has since written an apology to Dr. Ahmad . ) Social gathering The meeting has been described by those present as primarily an informal social gathering to discuss what should be done in the wake of Father Daniel 's capture . The defense maintains the discussion of the Kissinger matter never went beyond the letters . Dr. Ahmad insists he never knew such letters existed nor that they were being smuggled in and out of Lewisburg Prison where Father Philip was jailed for destroying draft files , by a special prisoner named Boyd Douglas who at some point became an FBI informer . " I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says excitedly . " If I had . I would have stopped it . " DrAhmad isalso. alleged to have made two phone calls to Boyd Douglas immediately after the meeting in Connecticut . He says , " I never talked to , read of , or heard of Boyd Douglas before the indictment . " Asked about the discussion in Connecticut Dr. Ahmad replied indirectly , " We have discussed publicly and privately a large nummer of possible things the antiwar movement could or could notclo . This includes $1 stock purchases on Wall Street , tying down the Pentagon by 5,000 phone calls , as well as the possibility of a citizens arrest . After 20 minutes of intense discussion you see this can not be done nonviolently . " It is a citizen 's right to be able to discuss any number of things and to reject them . " Why indicted ? Why then , does Dr. Ahmad think he was indicted ? " There is a lot of personal vendetta in this trial , " he says . " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he adds , referring to Father Daniel 's four and one-half months of highly publicized underground flight from arrest , which , it is widely rumored , was largely organized by Dr. Ahmad . Dr. Ahmad 's friends also fear that the government may present him to the jury as an outsider who turns people to violence . He insists violence has no place in the U.S. today . Dr. Ahmad has criticized violence in the American antiwar movement both publicly and privately . In reference to the charge of conspiring to blow up underground heating tunnels , he insisted in an interview , " We the defendants have never discussed bombing anything except to discuss it in negative terms . " As a revolutionary theorist , Dr. Ahinad has been considered fairly moderate by those on the Left . Got married Dr. Ahmad , who married an American schoolteacher , Julie Diamond , in 1969 , says he has remained here in large part because he " very deeply felt that it was not safe abro  --  unless we can change the policy in the U.S. towards third-world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former military regime of Gen. Yahya Kahn made , it impossible for him to go back . However , the new President , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , is a contemporary of Dr. Ahmad'a . According to friends , he might have been offered a high diplomatic post if he had been interested , which would have given him diplomatic immunity from the trial . Dr. Ahmad says he is " not interested in a government position , " but would prefer to join a major daily newspaper in Pakistan . His greatest sadness , he says , is not being able to go back to Pakistan at this particular moment . If the defendants win their case , the " alien " of the Harrisburg 7 will " definitely go back " to work for change in his homeland .
