What 're we talking about ? &nbsp; DIANALook , we 've got a bunch of hobgoblin radicals called the Ecumenical Liberation Army who go around taking home movies of themselves robbing banks . Maybe they 'll take movies of themselves kidnapping heiresses , hijacking 747 's , bombing bridges , assassinating ambassadors . We 'd open each week 's segment with that authentic footage , hire a couple of writers to write some story behind that footage , and we 've got ourselves a series . &nbsp; BOSCHA series about a bunch of bank-robbing guerrillas ? &nbsp; SCHLESINGERWhat 're we going to call it ?

They 've been clobbered on all sides by Vietnam , Watergate , the inflation , the depression . They 've turned off , shot up , and they 've fucked themselves limp . And nothing helps . So  --  this concept analysis report concludes  --  the American people want somebody to articulate their rage for them . I 've been telling you people since I took this job six months ago that I want angry shows . I do n't want conventional programming on this network . I want counterculture . I want anti-establishment . She closes the door . &nbsp; DIANANow , I do n't want to play butch boss with you people .

Frank Hackett , Senior Executive Vice President UBS-TV , is at the lectern delivering the Annual Report . &nbsp; HACKETT ( droning ) But the business of management is management . And , at the same time CCA took control , the UBS-TV network was foundering with less than seven percent of national television revenues , most network programs being sold at station rates . I am therefore pleased to announce I am submitting to the Board of Directors a plan for the coordination of the main profit centers , and with the specific intention of making each division more responsive to management .

If you had been patient , I would 've explained to you that I too thought Frank Hackett precipitate and that the reorganization of the News Division would not be executed until everyone , specifically you , Max , had been consulted and satisfied . Instead , you sulked off like a child and engaged this network in a shocking and disgraceful episode . Your position here is no longer tenable regardless of how management is restructured .

I met one of them a couple of weeks ago and thought of doing a show around her . " The Wayward Witch of Wall Street , " something like that . But , of course , if her tips were any good , she could wreck the market . So I called her this morning and asked her how she was on predicting the future . She said she was occasionally prescient .

Her name , aptly enough , is Sybil . Sybil the Soothsayer . You could give her two minutes of trance at the end of a Howard Beale show , say once a week , Friday , which is suggestively occult , and she could oraculate . Then next week , everyone tunes in to see how good her predictions were . &nbsp; MAXMaybe she could do the weather .  --  44  --  &nbsp; DIANA ( smiles ) Your network news show is going to need some help , Max , if it 's going to hold . Beale does n't do the angry man thing well at all . He 's too kvetchy . He 's being irascible . We want a prophet , not a curmudgeon . He should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of writers to write some jeremiads for him . I see you do n't fancy my suggestions . &nbsp; MAXHell , you 're not being serious , are you ? &nbsp; DIANAOh , I 'm serious . The fact is , I could make your Beale show the highest-rated news show in television , if you 'd let me have a crack at it . &nbsp; MAXWhat do you mean , have a crack at it ? &nbsp; DIANAI 'd like to program it for you , develop it . I would n't interfere with the actual news . But teevee is show biz , Max , and even the News has to have a little showmanship . &nbsp; MAXMy God , you are serious . &nbsp; DIANAI watched your six o'clock news today . It 's straight tabloid . You had a minute and a half on that lady riding a bike naked in Central Park . On the other hand , you had less than a minute of hard national and international news . It was all sex , scandal , brutal crimes , sports , children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think I 'll listen to any protestations of high standards of journalism . You 're right down in the street soliciting audiences like the rest of us . All I 'm saying is , if you 're going to hustle , at least do it right . I 'm going to bring this up at tomorrow 's network meeting , but I do n't like network hassles , and I was hoping you and I could work this out between us . That 's why I 'm here right now . &nbsp; MAX ( sighs ) And I was hoping you were looking for an emotional involvement with a craggy middle-aged man . &nbsp; DIANAI would n't rule that out entirely .  --  45  --  They appraise each other for the possibilities of something more than a professional relationship . They 're there . &nbsp; MAXWell , Diana , you bring all your ideas up at the meeting tomorrow . Because , if you do n't , I will . I think Howard is making a goddam fool of himself , and so does everybody Howard and I know in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work . Tomorrow , Howard goes back to the old format and this gutter depravity comes to an end . &nbsp; DIANA ( smiles , stands ) Okay . She leans to flick her ash into Max 's ashtray . By the cone of light issuing from the desk lamp , it is nipple-clear that she is bra-less . Max notes the assertive swells of her body . Diana moves languidly to the door to leave but Max suddenly speaks . &nbsp; MAXI do n't get it , Diana . You hung around till half past seven and came all the way down here just to pitch a couple of looney show biz ideas when you knew goddam well I 'd laugh you out of this office . I do n't get it . What 's your scam in this anyway ?

She glides back to the doorway again . &nbsp; MAXListen , if we can get back for a moment to that gypsy who predicted  --  46  --  all that about emotional involvements and middle-aged men . . . what 're you doing for dinner tonight ? Diana pauses in the doorway , then moves back to the telephone on the desk , taps out a number , waits for a moment . &nbsp; DIANA ( into phone ) I ca n't make it tonight , Luv , call me tomorrow .

A RESTAURANT Max and Diana are finishing dinner . Max orders two coffees , black . &nbsp; DIANA ( plying away at ice cream ) I was married for four years and pretended to be happy and had six years of analysis and pretended to be sane . My husband ran off with his boyfriend , and I had an affair with my analyst . He told me I was the worst lay he had ever had . I ca n't tell you how many men have told me what a lousy lay I am . I apparently have a masculine temperament . I arouse quickly , consummate  --  47  --  prematurely , and ca n't wait to get my clothes back on and get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything except my work .

I have a married daughter in Seattle who 's six months pregnant , and a younger girl who starts at Northwestern in January . &nbsp; DIANAWell , Max here we are . Middle-aged man reaffirming his middle-aged manhood and a terrified young woman with a father complex . What sort of script do you think we can make out of this ? &nbsp; MAXTerrified , are you ? &nbsp; DIANA ( pushes her ice cream away , regards him affably ) Terrified out of my skull , man . I 'm the hip generation , man , right on , cool , groovy , the greening of America , man , remember all that ? God , what humbugs we were .

Do n't open any windows around me , because I just might jump out . Am I scaring you off ? A WAITER brings the coffee . &nbsp; MAXNo . The corridor gossip says you 're Frank Hackett 's backstage girl . &nbsp; DIANA ( sipping coffee , smiles ) I 'm not . Frank 's a corporation man , body and soul . He has no loves , lusts or allegiances that are not consummately directed towards becoming a CCA Board Member . So why should he bother with me ? I 'm not even a stockholder . &nbsp; MAXHow about your loves , lusts and allegiances ? They smile at each other .  --  48  --  &nbsp; DIANAIs your wife in town ? &nbsp; MAXYes . &nbsp; DIANAWell , then , we better go to my place .

I feel connected to all living things , to flowers , birds , to all the animals of the world and even to some great unseen living force , what I think the Hindus call Prana .

Because when a national television network in the person of bubby here ( indicates Herron ) comes to me and says he wants to put the on-going struggle  --  64  --  of the oppressed masses on prime-time television , I have to regard this askance . . . Diana would answer Haywood , but he 's just hitting his stride , and chairs are brought in . &nbsp; HAYWOODI have to figure this as an antithetical distraction . The thesis here , if you follow me , is that the capitalist state is in a terminal condition now , and the antithesis is the maturation of the fascist state , and when the correlative appendages of the fascist state come and say to me they want to give the revolution a weekly hour of prime-time television , I 've got to figure this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all to sit .

A hush follows Haywood 's Hegelian instruction , and Diana would again answer , but Haywood is center-stage , in the full swell of rhetoric . &nbsp; HAYWOODThe ruling classes are running scared , right ? You turned the full force of your cossack cops and paramilitary organs of repression against us . But now the slave masters hear the rumble of revolution in their ears . So you have no alternative but to co-opt us . Put us on teevee and pull our fangs . And we 're supposed to sell out , right ? For your gangster gold ? Well , we 're not going to sell out , baby ! You can take your fascist teevee and shove it right up your paramilitary ass ! I 'm here to tell you , we do n't sell out ! We do n't want your gold ! We 're not going on your teevee !

I 'll tell you what I want . I want a lot more film like the bank rip-off the Ecumenicals sent in . The way I see this series is every week we open with the authentic footage of an act of political terrorism , taken on the spot and in the actual moment ; then we go into the drama behind the opening film footage . That 's your job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring in that film for us . The network ca n't deal with them directly . They are , after all , wanted criminals . &nbsp; LAUREENThe Ecumenical Liberation Army is an ultra-left sect creating political confusion with wildcat violence and pseudo-insurrectionary acts , which the Communist Party does not endorse . The American masses are not yet ready for open revolt . We would not want to produce a television show celebrating historically deviational terrorism . &nbsp; DIANAMs . Hobbs , I 'm offering you an hour of prime-time television every week into which you can stick whatever propaganda you want . &nbsp; LAUREENThe Ecumenicals are an undisciplined ultra-left gang , and the leader is an eccentric to say the least . He calls himself the Great Ahmed Khan and wears a hussar 's shako . &nbsp; DIANAMs . Hobbs , we 're talking about thirty to fifty million people a shot . That 's a lot better than handing out mimeographed pamphlets on ghetto street corners . &nbsp; LAUREENI 'll have to take this matter to the Central Committee , and I 'd better check this out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.A. until Saturday , and I 'd like to get this thing rolling .

She stands there  --  showered with APPLAUSE , beaming , exultant . &nbsp; DIANAWe 've got the number one show in television ! ( applause ) And at next year 's affiliates ' meeting , I 'll be standing here telling you we 've got the top five ! ( tumult ) ACROSS Hackett at the dais with Diana in background . An ASSISTANT MANAGER leans across Hackett to deliver a discreet message . &nbsp; DIANALast year , we were the number four network . Next year , we 're number one ! ( tumult ) &nbsp; AUDIENCEWe 're Number One ! We 're Number One ! Hackett rises and , with apologies to his neighbors , follows the assistant manager through the shadows of the dais and heads out . &nbsp; DIANAIt is exactly seven o'clock here in Los Angeles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this city are turning their dials to Channel 3  --  and that 's our channel ! MUSIC : A Rataplan of Kettledrums and a Tarantara ! COCKTAIL AREA OF THE GRAND BALLROOM A portable TV set is perched on a bar .  --  83  --  &nbsp; ANNOUNCER ( on TV ) Ladies and gentlemen ! Let 's hear it ! How do you feel ? &nbsp; STUDIO AUDIENCE ( on TV , happily roaring ) We 're mad as hell , and we 're not going to take this anymore ! PULL BACK to show the vast cocktail area of the Grand Ballroom , being cleared by WAITERS and BUSBOYS : hor d'oeuvres , spreads and booze are carried away , tables and chairs packed off , linens whisked and folded . A couple of WAITERS watch " The Howard Beale Show . " &nbsp; STUDIO ANNOUNCER ( on TV ) Ladies and gentlemen , the mad prophet of the airways  --  Howard Beale ! On the TV set , the houselights dim , the curtain rises . As before , on a bare stage with the stained glass window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his austere black suit trudges out and explodes . &nbsp; HOWARD ( on TV ) All right , listen to me ! Listen carefully ! This is your goddam life I 'm talking about today ! In this country , when one company takes over another company , they simply buy up a controlling share of the stock . But first they have to file notice with the government . That 's how CCA  --  the Communications Corporation of America  --  bought up the company that owns this network . And now somebody 's buying up CCA ! Some company named Western World Funding Corporation is buying up CCA ! They filed their notice this morning ! Well , just who the hell is Western World Funding Corporation ? It 's a consortium of banks and insurance companies who are not buying CCA for themselves but as agents for somebody else ! LONG WIDE-ANGLE SHOT with TV set in foreground shows the cocktail area clean-up , when across the spacious room the doors open and Hackett follows the assistant manager into the Ballroom . Hackett lingers at the doors , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of the tables still standing . &nbsp; HOWARD ( on TV ) Well , who 's this somebody else ? They wo n't tell you !  --  84  --  They wo n't tell you , they wo n't tell the Senate , they wo n't tell the SEC , the FCC , the Justice Department , they wo n't tell anybody ! They say it 's none of our business ! The hell it ai n't ! Hackett continues to watch as a jack phone is brought to him . People cluster around the TV set in the background , while Hackett accepts his call . &nbsp; HACKETT ( on phone ) This is Mr. Hackett , do you have a New York call for me ? ( calls to the group around the TV ) Do you want to turn that down , please . . . ? The volume goes down a very little bit in a REVERSE ANGLE ACROSS TV SET with Hackett in the background . &nbsp; HOWARD ( on TV , volume lower ) Well , I 'll tell you who they 're buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investment Corporation ! They 're buying it for the Arabs ! &nbsp; HACKETT ( plays the hearty executive on the phone ) Clarence ? Frank Hackett here ! How 's everything back in New York ? How 's the good lady ? . . . All right , take it easy , Clarence , I do n't know what you 're talking about . . . When ? Clarence , take it easy . " The Howard Beale Show " ' s just going on out here . You guys get it three hours earlier in New York . . . Clarence , take it easy . How the hell could I see it ? It 's just on now  --  well , when did Mr. Jensen call you ? REVERSE ACROSS TV SET . In background , Hackett has hung up and is slowly walking toward the group watching the TV set . &nbsp; HOWARD ( on TV ) We know the Arabs control more than sixteen billion dollars in this country ! They own a chunk of Fifth Avenue , twenty downtown pieces of Boston , a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salt Lake City . They own big hunks of the Atlanta Hilton , the Arizona Land and Cattle Company , part of a bank in California , the Bank of the Commonwealth in Detroit ! They control ARAMCO , so that puts them into Exxon , Texaco and Mobil Oil ! They 're all over  --  New Jersey , Louisville , St. Louis , Missouri ! And that 's only what we know about ! There 's a hell of a lot more we do n't  --  85  --  know about , because all those Arab petro-dollars are washed through Switzerland and Canada and the biggest banks in this country ! Hackett peers over a WAITER 'S SHOULDER to watch the show . &nbsp; HOWARD ( on TV ) For example , what we do n't know about is this CCA deal and all the other CCA deals ! ( Hackett winces . ) Right now , the Arabs have screwed us out of enough American dollars to come back and , with our own money , buy General Motors , IBM , ITT , AT and T , Dupont , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell , they already own half of England . LOS ANGELES , UBS BUILDING . A VIDEOTAPE ROOM It 's been a few hours , but not that long since the banquet . Now in an unglamorous room cluttered with electronic equipment , Hackett , Nelson Chaney and Walter Amundsen , all tuxedoed , and Diana , evening-gowned , sit or stand while they painfully watch a replay of " The Howard Beale Show " on the big screen . TWO TECHNICIANS fiddle with their equipment as Howard 's speech picks up where we left off . &nbsp; HOWARD ( on screen ) Now , listen to me , goddammit ! The Arabs are simply buying us ! A handful of agas , shahs and emirs who despise this country and everything it stands for  --  democracy , freedom , the right for me to get up on television and tell you about it  --  a couple of dozen medieval fanatics are going to own where you work , where you live , what you read , what you see , your cars , your bowling alleys , your mortgages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids , your whole life . . . ! &nbsp; AMUNDSENThe son of a bitch is effective , all right . Hackett , who 's seen all this already , is n't even watching . He is sprawled in his chair , eyes closed , numbed , serene with despair . &nbsp; HOWARD ( on screen ) . . . And there 's not a single law on the books to stop  --  86  --  them ! There 's only one thing that can stop them  --  you ! So I want you to get up now . I want you to get out of your chairs and go to the phone . Right now . I want you to go to your phone or get in your car and drive into the Western Union office in town . I want everybody listening to me to get up right now and send a telegram to the White House . . . &nbsp; HACKETT ( sighs in soft anguish ) Oh , God . . . &nbsp; HOWARD ( on-screen ) By midnight , I want a million telegrams in the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House ! Get up ! . . . Right now ! And send President Ford a telegram saying , " I 'm mad as hell , and I 'm not going to take this anymore ! I do n't want the banks selling my country to the Arabs ! I want this CCA deal stopped now ! " &nbsp; HACKETTOh , God . . . &nbsp; HOWARD ( on screen ) I want this CCA deal stopped now ! I want this CCA deal stopped now ! At which point , Howard keels over in his now familiar prophetic SWOON . On screen , ATTENDANTS come to carry Howard off . &nbsp; CHANEY ( to a technician ) Is that it ? Does he come back later in the show ? &nbsp; TECHNICIANThat 's it . This is one of those shows he just zonks out . &nbsp; CHANEY ( to the technicians ) Look could we have the room ? &nbsp; TECHNICIANSure . The two technicians exit . SILENCE fills the cluttered room . Amundsen and Hackett sit in their chairs , Chaney leans against a side wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , Amundsen stretches and stands . &nbsp; AMUNDSENWell , I 'd like to see a typescript and run it a couple of more  --  87  --  times . But , as for this whole CCA deal with the Saudis , you 'd know a lot more about that than I would , Frank . Is it true ? Hackett sighs . &nbsp; HACKETT ( muffled ) Yes . CCA has two billion in loans with the Saudis , and they hold every pledge we 've got . We need that Saudi money bad . ( He stands , so wretched he is tranquil . ) A disaster . This show is a disaster , an unmitigated disaster , the death knell . I 'm ruined , I 'm dead , I 'm finished . &nbsp; CHANEYMaybe we 're overstating Beale 's clout with the public . &nbsp; HACKETTAn hour ago , Clarence McElheny called me from New York . It was ten o'clock in the East , and our people in the White House report they were already knee-deep in telegrams . By tomorrow morning , they 'll be suffocating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deal ? &nbsp; HACKETTThey can hold it up . The SEC could hold this deal up for twenty years , if they wanted to . I 'm finished . Any second that phone 's going to ring , and Clarence McElheny 's going to tell me Mr. Jensen wants me in his office tomorrow morning so he can personally chop my head off . ( Tears stream shamelessly down his cheeks , as he ponders his fate , a broken man . ) Four hours ago , I was the Sun God at CCA , Mr. Jensen 's hand-picked golden boy , the heir apparent . Now I 'm a man without a corporation ! &nbsp; DIANA ( comes off the back wall ) Let 's get back to Howard Beale . You 're not seriously going to pull Beale off the air . &nbsp; HACKETTMr . Jensen is unhappy with Howard Beale and wants him discontinued . &nbsp; DIANAHe may be unhappy , but he is n't stupid enough to withdraw the number one show on television out of pique .  --  88  --  &nbsp; HACKETT ( explodes ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrath of God ! And the wrath of God wants Howard Beale fired ! &nbsp; DIANAWhat for ? Every other network will grab him the minute he walks out the door . He 'll be back on the air for ABC tomorrow . And we 'll lose twenty points in audience share in the first week , roughly a forty million loss in revenues for the year . &nbsp; HACKETTI 'm going to kill Howard Beale ! I 'm going to impale the son of a bitch with a sharp stick through the heart ! &nbsp; DIANAAnd let 's not discount federal action by the Justice Department . If CCA pulls Beale off the air as an act of retribution , that 's a flagrant violation of network autonomy and an egregious breach of the consent decree . &nbsp; HACKETT ( liking his new train of thought ) I 'll take out a contract on him . I 'll hire professional killers . I 'll do it myself . I 'll strangle him with a sash-cord . &nbsp; DIANANo . I do n't think Jensen is going to fire anybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hackett picks it up . &nbsp; HACKETT ( on phone ) Hackett . . . yes , Clarence . I 've already booked my flight . . . Well , can you give me a little more time than that ? I 've got the red-eye flight , I wo n't be back in New York till six tomorrow morning . . . That 'll be just fine . I 'll see you then . . . He returns the phone to its cradle , regards Diana . &nbsp; HACKETTMr . Jensen wants to meet Howard Beale personally . He wants Mr. Beale in his office at ten o'clock tomorrow morning . STREET IN FRONT OF THE CCA BUILDING Both dressed in banker 's gray , Hackett herds Howard toward the building 's  --  89  --  entrance , and it becomes clear Howard is in a beatified state . His eyes glisten transcendentally , his smile beams from an elevated spirit . Abruptly , he raises his arms and makes a resonating pronouncement . &nbsp; HOWARD ( imbued ) The final revelation is at hand ! I have seen the shattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bear witness to the light ! This outburst does n't seem to bother most of the PASSERSBY , although SOME ask , " Hey , that 's Howard Beale , is n't it ? " The outburst does appall Frank Hackett , who stares in distress and entreats some god in the heavens . He clutches at Howard 's arm to get him moving again . pp. 54-69 &nbsp; pp. 90-107 ARTHUR JENSEN 'S OFFICE An enormous space with two walls of windows towering over the Manhattan landscape . SUNLIGHT streams in . Arthur Jensen rises from behind his massive desk to greet the man he has summoned . &nbsp; JENSENGood morning , Mr. Beale . They tell me you 're a madman . &nbsp; HOWARD ( closing the door behind himself ) Only desultorily . &nbsp; JENSENHow are you now ? &nbsp; HOWARD ( as mad as a hatter ) I 'm as mad as a hatter . &nbsp; JENSENWho is n't ? I 'm taking you to our conference room , which seems more seemly a setting for what I have to say to you . I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines and automobile parts , hair brushes and electronic equipment . They say I can sell anything . I 'd like to try and sell something to you . . . He takes Howard 's arm and leads him through oaken doors out of this office and into . . .  --  90  --  CCA BUILDING , CONFERENCE ROOM The darkened conference room where Frank Hackett delivered his annual report is now an overwhelming cathedral bleached by the sunlight seeping into every fold and corner . The enormous curtains are up , and an almost celestial light pours in . Being on the 43rd and 44th floors , the splendid view of the sky outside is sporadically interrupted by the towers of other skyscrapers . The double semi-circular bank of seats are all empty , and the general effect is one of hushed vastness . &nbsp; JENSENValhalla , Mr. Beale , please sit down . He leads Howard down the steps to the floor level . Jensen himself ascends to the small stage and podium . Howard sits in one of the 200-odd seats . Jensen pushes a button , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light until the vast room is utterly dark . The pinspots at each of the desks , including the one where Howard sits , pop on , lit by an unseen hand and creating a miniature Milky Way effect . A shaft of white LIGHT shoots out from the rear of the room , spotting Jensen at the podium , a sun in its own little galaxy . Jensen suddenly wheels to his audience of one and roars . &nbsp; JENSENYou have meddled with the primal forces of nature , Mr. Beale , and I wo n't have it , is that clear ? ! You think you have merely stopped a business deal  --  that is not the case ! The Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country , and now they must put it back . It is ebb and flow , tidal gravity , it is ecological balance ! You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples . There are no nations ! There are no peoples ! There are no Russians ! There are no Arabs ! There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only one holistic system of systems , one vast and immane , interwoven , interacting , multi-variate , multi-national dominion of dollars ! Petro-dollars , electro-dollars , multi-dollars , Reichmarks , rubles , rin , pounds and shekels ! It is the international system of currency that determines the totality of life on this planet ! That is the natural order of things today ! That is the atomic , sub-atomic and galactic structure of things  --  91  --  today ! And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature , and you will atone ! Am I getting through to you , Mr. Beale ? You get up on your little twenty-one inch screen , Mr. Beale , and howl about America and democracy . There is no America . There is no democracy . There is only IBM and ITT and AT and T and Dupont , Dow , Union Carbide and Exxon . Those are the nations of the world today . What do you think the Russians talk about in their councils of state ? Karl Marx ? They pull out their linear programming charts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments just like we do . We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies , Mr. Beale . The world is a college of corporations , inexorably determined by the immutable by-laws of business . The world is a business , Mr. Beale ! It has been that way since man crawled out of the slime , and our children , Mr. Beale , will live to see that perfect world without war and famine , oppression and brutality  --  one vast and ecumenical holding company , for whom all men will work to serve a common profit , in which all men will hold a share of stock , all necessities provided , all anxieties tranquilized , all boredom amused . And I have chosen you to preach this evangel , Mr. Beale . &nbsp; HOWARD ( humble whisper ) Why me ? &nbsp; JENSENBecause you 're on television , dummy . Sixty million people watch you every night of the week , Monday through Friday . Howard slowly rises , so that he is lit only by the ethereal diffusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stares transfixed at Jensen . &nbsp; HOWARDI have seen the face of God ! In the background at the podium , Jensen considers this curious statement . &nbsp; JENSENYou just might be right , Mr. Beale . &nbsp; NARRATOR ( off-screen ) That evening , Howard Beale went on the air to preach the corporate cosmology of Arthur Jensen .  --  92  --  NETWORK NEWS CONTROL ROOM The CREW are posted at their various control panels and seem , if anything , a little more bored . On the SHOW MONITOR , Howard Beale stands in his stained-glass-filtered spotlight . Rather than his old enraged self , he seems sad , resigned , weary . &nbsp; HOWARD ( on monitor ) Last night , I got up here and asked you people to stand up and fight for your heritage , and you did . And it was beautiful . Six million telegrams were received at the White House . The Arab takeover of CCA has been stopped . The people spoke , the people won . It was a radiant eruption of democracy . But I think that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to happen again . Because , in the bottom of all our terrified souls , we all know that democracy is a dying giant , a sick , sick dying , decaying political concept , writhing in its final pain . I do n't mean the United States is finished as a world power . The United States is the most powerful , the richest , the most advanced country in the world , light-years ahead of any other country . And I do n't mean the Communists are going to take over the world . The Communists are deader than we are . What 's finished is the idea that this great country is dedicated to the freedom and flourishing of every individual in it . It 's the individual that 's finished . It 's the single , solitary human being who 's finished . It 's every single one of you out there who 's finished . Because this is no longer a nation of independent individuals . This is a nation of two hundred-odd million transistorized , deodorized , whiter-than-white , steel-belted bodies , totally unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . ( Howard sits on a corner of the stage . ) Well , the time has come to say , is dehumanization such a bad word ? Because good or bad , that 's what 's so . The whole world is becoming humanoid , creatures that look human but are n't . The whole world , not just us . We 're just the most advanced country , so we 're getting there first . The whole world 's people are becoming mass-produced , programmed , numbered , insensate things useful only to produce and consume other mass-produced things , all of them as unnecessary and useless as we are . . .  --  93  --  &nbsp; NARRATORIt was a perfectly admissible argument that Howard Beale advanced in the days that follows ; it was , however , also a very tedious and depressing one .

Diana appears in the doorway and regards Max coldly . &nbsp; DIANAYou know , you could help me out with Howard if you wanted to . He listens to you . You 're his best friend . &nbsp; MAX ( exploding off his chair ) I 'm tired of this hysteria about Howard Beale ! &nbsp; DIANA ( also erupting ) Every time you see somebody in your family , you come back in one of these morbid middle-aged moods ! &nbsp; MAX ( raging around the room ) And I 'm tired of finding you on the goddamned phone every time I turn around .

I 'll manage . I always have , always will . I 'm more concerned about you . Once I go , you 'll be back in the eye of your own desolate terrors . You 're not the boozer type , so I figure a year , maybe two before you crack up or jump out your fourteenth floor office window . &nbsp; DIANAStop selling , Max . I do n't need you . She exits out into . . . THE LIVING ROOM . . . and across that to . . . THE KITCHEN . . . where a kettle is steaming . She fetches a cup and saucer from the cupboard and would make some instant coffee , but she is overtaken by a curious little spasm . Her hand holding the cup and saucer is shaking so much she has to put them down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She moves out of the kitchen into . . THE LIVING ROOM . . . where she stands in the middle of the room and shouts at Max through the open bedroom doorway .  --  101  --  &nbsp; DIANA ( cries out ) I do n't want your pain ! I do n't want your menopausal decay and death ! I do n't need you , Max . &nbsp; MAXYou need me badly . I 'm your last contact with human reality . I love you and that painful , decaying love is the only thing between you and the shrieking nothingness you live the rest of the day ! He slams the valise shut . &nbsp; DIANAThen do n't leave me ! &nbsp; MAXIt 's too late , Diana . There 's nothing left in you that I can live with . You 're one of Howard 's humanoids , and if I stay with you , I 'll be destroyed ! Like Howard Beale was destroyed . Like Laureen Hobbs was destroyed . Like everything you and the whole institution of television touch gets destroyed . You are television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy . All of life is reduced to the common rubble of banality . War , murder , death are all the same to you as bottles of beer . The daily business of life is a corrupt comedy . You even shatter the sensations of time and space into split seconds and instant replays . You are madness , Diana , virulent madness , and everything you touch dies with you . Well , not me ! Not while I can still feel pleasure and pain and love ! Oh , hell , Diana , it 's over with us . I 'm not sure it ever really happened , but I know it 's over . He turns back to his valise and buckles it . Diana sits on a chair . A moment later , Max comes out of the bedroom , lugging a raincoat and his valise . He lugs his way across the living room , then pauses for a moment . &nbsp; MAXIt 's a happy ending , Diana . Wayward husband comes to his senses , returns to his wife with whom he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left alone in her arctic desolation . Music up with a swell . Final commercial . And here are a few scenes from next week 's show . He disappears down the foyer . The CLICK of the front door opening is followed by the CLACK of the door closing . Diana pulls her shower robe around her , alone in her arctic desolation .  --  102  --  Section Details UBS 20TH FLOOR , LOBBY/LOUNGE/CORRIDOR. 10:15 P.M. A solemn Frank Hackett in blue suit walks down the long , hushed corridor to the large double doors of his office . Nelson Chaney is waiting for him . &nbsp; CHANEYHow 'd it go ? Hackett sighs , enters . . . SECRETARY 'S OFFICE . . . where Herb Thackeray and Joe Donnelly are lounging . Everybody follows Hackett into . . . HACKETT 'S OFFICE ( ONCE EDWARD RUDDY 'S OFFICE ) The crepuscular grandeur of Manhattan glitters in the nighttime below . Waiting on the sofas inside are Walter Amundsen and Diana . Hackett sits behind his desk . The others find places around the room . &nbsp; HACKETTMr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the air . Mr. Jensen thinks Howard Beale is bringing a very important message to the American people , so he wants Howard Beale on the air . And he wants him kept on . Nobody has anything to say to this . &nbsp; HACKETTMr . Jensen feels we are being too catastrophic in our thinking . I argued that television was a volatile industry in which success and failure were determined week by week . Mr. Jensen said he did not like volatile industries and suggested with a certain sinister silkiness that volatility in business usually reflected bad management . He did n't really care if Howard Beale was the number one show in television or the fiftieth . He did n't really care if the Beale show lost money . The network should be stabilized so that it can carry a losing show and still maintain an overall profit . Mr. Jensen has an important message he wants conveyed to the American people , and Howard Beale is conveying it . He wants Howard Beale on the air , and he wants him kept  --  103  --  on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where does that put us , Diana ? &nbsp; DIANA ( taking papers out of her attach case ) That puts us in the shithouse , that 's where that puts us. ( holds up a sheaf of papers ) Do you want me to go through this ? &nbsp; HACKETTYes . &nbsp; DIANAThe Beale show Q score is down to thirty-three . Most of this loss occurred in the child and teen and eighteen-thirty-four categories , which were our core markets . It is the A.R . department 's carefully considered judgment  --  and mine  --  that if we get rid of Beale , we should be able to maintain a very respectable Nielsen in the high twenties . The other segments on the Beale show  --  Sybil the Soothsayer , Jim Webbing , the Vox Populi  --  have all developed their own audiences . Our A.R . reports show without exception that it is Howard Beale that 's the destructive force here . Minimally , we are talking about a ten point differential in shares . I think Joe ought to spell it out for us . Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think we could sell complete positions on the whole . As a matter of fact , we 're just getting into the pre-Christmas gift-sellers , and I 'll tell you the agencies are coming back to me with four dollar CPMs . If that 's any indication , we 're talking a forty , forty-five million dollar loss in annual revenues . &nbsp; THACKERAYYou guys want to hear all the flak I 'm getting from the affiliates ? &nbsp; HACKETTWe know all about it , Herb . &nbsp; AMUNDSENAnd you would describe Mr. Jensen 's position on Beale as inflexible ? &nbsp; HACKETTIntractable and adamantine . &nbsp; CHANEYSo what 're we going to do about this Beale son of a bitch ?  --  104  --  A sadness settles over the top management of UBS-TV  --  a reluctant silence . &nbsp; HACKETT ( sighs ) I suppose we 'll have to kill him . Another long , contemplative silence . &nbsp; HACKETTI do n't suppose you have any ideas on that , Diana ? &nbsp; DIANAWell , what would you fellows say to an assassination ?

VOICES of the network executives just interrupted CONTINUE . &nbsp; DIANA ( off-screen ) . . . I think I can get the Mao Tse Tung people to kill Beale for us . As one of their programs . In fact , it 'll make a hell of a kick-off show for the season . We 're facing heavy opposition from the other networks on Wednesday nights , and " The Mao Tse Tung Hour " could use a sensational show for an opener . The whole thing would be done right on camera in the studio . We ought to get a fantastic look-in audience with the assassination of Howard Beale as our opening show . UBS LOBBY , ELEVATOR AREA The waiting , hopeful AUDIENCE is herded into elevators .

The VOICES continue .  --  105  --  &nbsp; HACKETT ( off-screen ) There must be a formula for the computation of a purchase price . &nbsp; AMUNDSEN ( off-screen ) Offhand , I think it was based on a multiple of 1975 earnings with the base period in 1975 . I think it was fifty percent of salary plus twenty-five percent of the first year 's profits . . . HACKETT 'S OFFICE The meeting is still going on . &nbsp; AMUNDSEN. . . multiplied by the unexpired portion of the contract . I do n't think the show has any substantial syndication value , would you say , Diana ? &nbsp; DIANASyndication profits are minimal .

HACKETT 'S OFFICE The meeting continues on . &nbsp; HACKETTWell , the issue is : shall we kill Howard Beale or not ? I 'd like to hear some more opinions on that . &nbsp; DIANAI do n't see we have any option , Frank . Let 's kill the son of a bitch . THE HOWARD BEALE SHOW STUDIO SET The applause for Howard Beale subsides . HUSH  --  suddenly , the HUSH is shattered by a HORRENDOUS ENFILADE of GUNFIRE . An embroidery of red bullet holes perforate Howard 's shirt and jacket , and we might even see the impact of a head wound as he pitches backwards dead .  --  107  --  A BANK OF FOUR COLOR TELEVISION MONITORS It is 7:14 P.M. , Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the network news programs on CBS , NBC , ABC and UBS-TV .
