Spring is usually a time of heightened activity along the Hudson River , as fishermen turn out in force to share in its bounty . But this year is different . New York State authorities have already closed the river to commercial fishing for striped bass , eels and several other species . Now , fish and game officials fear they may also have to forbid fishing for the roe-laden shad that are just making their appearance in the Hudson . Reason : the river is polluted with a particularly persistent and dangerous class of chemical compounds called polychlorinated biphenyls , or PCBs . Worse , despite remedial action by General Electric Co. , the principal polluter , the Hudson is likely to be contaminated for years . <P> PCB compounds have been accumulating in the environment for more than 45 years . In commercial production since 1929 , the colorless , odorless , syrupy PCBs were once widely used in industry as softeners in plastics , paints and rubber , as additives in printing inks , and in oils used in the preparation of laboratory slides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety of PCBs , their use has been almost exclusively confined in recent years to transformers and capacitors , in which they are sealed . The chemicals are ideal for these electrical devices because they are excellent insulators , highly fire resistant and good conductors of heat . GE uses the PCBs in equipment manufactured at its Fort Edward and Hudson Falls plants on the upper Hudson , about 45 miles north of Albany . <P> There was little concern about PCBs until 1968 , when an estimated 1,600 Japanese came down with a baffling and painful ailment labeled Yusho ( rice-oil poisoning ) . Their symptoms-skin eruptions , vomiting , inflamed eyes and palsy - occurred after they had eaten rice oil that had been accidentally contaminated by PCBs . Japan promptly banned almost all use of the compounds , even in electrical equipment , and suddenly everyone was wary of their presence . In 1970 the Campbell Soup Co. found high PCB levels in 146,000 New York State chickens destined for its products , and the birds-which probably picked up the chemical from contaminated feed - were destroyed . By 1972 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. The compound had either been discharged directly into the water by electrical equipment factories , or had been washed into the rivers by drainage from junked electrical equipment . In few places were PCB levels higher than in the Hudson , where GE 's two capacitor plants had been dumping them at the rate of about 30 lbs . per day since the early 1950s . In tests conducted last summer , striped bass , carp and other fish species were found to contain many times the allowed federal limit of 5 parts of PCBs per million . One eel was found to have 559.25 parts per million of the chemical-an amount so high that an adult who ate a 7 oz. portion would get 50% of his lifetime allowance of the substance in a single serving . Says Robert H. Boyle , a writer and longtime Hudson River fisherman : " Shopping in a fish market these days is like picking your way through a minefield . " <P> Some Symptoms . The long-term health effects of PCBs on humans are still unknown . But GE has admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down with some of the same symptoms as those exhibited by the Japanese victims of Yusho . The chemicals have also been found to cause cancer in laboratory animals .
