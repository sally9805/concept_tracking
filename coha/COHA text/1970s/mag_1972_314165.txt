In A Letter from the Publisher in the issue of Feb. 7 , we issued a special invitation to our female readers to write to us about their experiences and attitudes as women , and to tell us how their views on this subject have changed in recent years . The following is a sampling of the response : <P> <P> Times Have Changed <P> Sir / Being a woman is more fun than it was ten years ago . Times have changed and I with them . Only now do I realize the source of my past discontent and I relish my new-found freedom . <P> At times speaking my mind may make others uncomfortable , but oh what it does for me . <P> PAMELA LUCARELLI <P> Kirkland , Wash . <P> <P> Sir / Women are more aware of the personal worth and professional potential of each other now . I too had sung the chorus , " I 'd rather talk to men than women " and " coeds are all parrots . " We joined in the great putdown , even of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men , had either to go it alone second class or latch on to a man who would give us his " success . " <P> Now I will not accept the injustices , oversights and cultural limitations imposed by inaccurate language and illogical concepts . I respect the right of all women and men to a full range of life-choices and to self-determination . <P> GERALDINE HAMMOND <P> Wichita , Kans . <P> <P> Sir / As a member of the " do nothing " generation ( college class of ' 59 ) I 'd always accepted the role of wife and mother . Pantie raids came before my time and rioting , hippies and pot came after . Thirty-three years of conditioning told me that I was not very smart , not very pretty , not very strong , and that achievement really was n't expected of me because I was female . My parents were noticeably relieved when I married . <P> Becoming involved in the abortion reform issue during the past year has opened up a whole new world to me . Women are at last emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do have a workable brain after all . I 'm having a wonderful time using mine at last . <P> ( MRS . ) VIRGINIA HANSON <P> Jackson , Mich . <P> <P> Sir / My experience is in two fields-the arts and business . In my area in the arts ( opera chorus ) , voice requirements preclude discrimination . In business , however , my field is communications and until eight months ago my case was classic-same work , much lower pay , no status , no opportunity for advancement . Then suddenly I was promoted to management level , a " first " with this company . Who can say why ? Women 's Lib , Government regulations , more enlightened executives , devoted work at any job they gave me . Probably a combination of all . <P> Women must work as hard as ever , but at last it is beginning to be worth it . <P> VINETTE BOYCE <P> New York City <P> Sir / I used to think Women 's Lib was silly , but I suppose every woman has her own personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal than others . Mine came last year when I was the only woman elected to the board of directors of our local teachers ' organization . When we sat down for our first meeting I was given a pad of paper because it was naturally assumed that I would take notes . Pow ! The message was loud and clear . <P> Suddenly a lot of abstractions became more concrete .
