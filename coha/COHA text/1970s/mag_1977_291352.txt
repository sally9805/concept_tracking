Pantheon. $12.95 . <P> <P> If man had not invented them , fairies would have to exist . How else could mortals account for lost objects and the malfunctions of the material world ? It was no accident that a new strain of elves-gremlins-magically appeared at about the time of World War II , when things began going wrong with airplanes . For centuries the presence of fairies helped temper parental rage at the misbehavior of children ; the ethereal little devils were responsible . When things went bump in the night , it was far better to suspect the hobgoblins than creatures more substantial and threatening . Most important , the winged folk held out the prospect of an airy , insubstantial and blissfully frivolous life beyond the reach of the wealthiest voluptuaries . The highest compliment Edmund Spenser could pay Elizabeth I was to call her the Faerie Queene . The Little People could do everything that the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why J.M. Barrie 's Peter Pan ( 1904 ) amounted to such a calumny on fairies . Barrie wrote , " Every time a child says ' I do n't believe in fairies ' there is a little fairy somewhere that falls down dead .

Warner 's elves are in many ways mirror images of men . They can not weep and do not hate . They reproduce with difficulty but live for centuries : " Fairies are constructed for longevity , not fertility . " They are governed exclusively by women-the more capricious the better . <P> <P> Mocking the human dream of taking wing , elves aspire to a place in society so high that flying will be beneath them .
