txt The moderator of the first debate between the Democratic and Republican candidates for governor turns to Hugh Carey , the Democratic incumbent , and asks him what he admires most about his opponent , Perry Duryea . " I respect the fact Mr. Duryea admits he was once indicted , " the governor replies  --  while failing to note that the charge , an election-law misdemeanor , was dismissed . No one ever said that politics was an enterprise for faint hearts , but this campaign is extraordinary : These two men despise each other . Mr. Carey , 59 years old , was elected governor four years ago in a thundering landslide , closing out the Nelson Rockefeller Republican era . Currently he is struggling against Mr. Duryea , 56 , a lobster wholesaler from the eastern tip of Long Island who is the minority leader in the state assembly . " We admit we are behind , " says John Burns , the governor 's campaign manager . But if Mr. Carey is trailing , almost no one expects him to wind up very far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shows them as much as 13 points ahead , are running scared  --  and a little confused . The Republican strategists , fighting each other almost as much as the opposition , are still debating what they should be doing between now and election day on Nov. 7 , puffing up Mr. Duryea or knocking down Mr. Carey . " Crisis of Confidence " Mr. Duryea is a tough , silver-haired politician . Over and over again , his admirers ( and some of his detractors ) note that he looks like a governor . Mr. Duryea was minority leader in the state asqAmbly from 1966 to 1968 , speaker from 1969 to 1974 , and minority leader the last four years . He is often described as the state 's most powerful suburban politician . Mr. Duryea charges that New York has been adrift under Mr. Carey 's rule . He says it 's a " tragic irony of history " that New York state , which has produced so many national leaders , is now suffering a " crisis of confidence . " He hits hard , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs out of the state . But the key issue is a personal one : Mr. Carey 's complex personality . " The negative ratings for him ( in the polls ) are very high , " says one of Mr. Duryea 's strategists . Mr. Duryea , who is relatively unknown among New Yorkers , does n't have the same kind of problem . In that first debate , the moderator , Ken Auletta , asked Mr. Carey about the personality business . " People , " Mr. Auletta said to Mr. Carey , " say you are not very nice . - that you are as isolated as a monk . Why is this ? " " I just want you to love New York , " the governor replied , echoing the slogan the state has adopted in its widely acclaimed promo ' tional campaign . " You do n't have to love me to vote for me . " " Aloof and Alone " Mr. Carey is in trouble , Some of the strategists say , because of the dark side of his nature summed up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; self : " Aloof and alone . " But he might pull " the election out , these same strategists say , because of the flip side of his personality ? his intelligence , his ability to rise to a real challenge , and his capacity to be charming when he absolutely has to be . Mr. Carey has never received the attention routinely received by his cross-country colleague , Gov . Jerry Brown of California , but in many ways he is a more interesting politician . He began his political life as a Congressman from a conservative Brooklyn district . He remained in Congress for 14 years , rising to a position of some influence on the Ways ' and Means Committee . There he became friendly with then New York Gov . Rockefel ? ler , who frequently appeared before the committee to support aid to New York City . Mr. Carey and his wife , Helen , raised 14 children . The two oldest children died in an automobile accident in 1969 , and Mrs. Carey died of cancer in 1974 . When he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much did what he was told . He was never a party hack , but that 's the kind of reputation he made for himself . - " The Next Thing We Know . . " 1 ? " The guy we elected governor , " says a , : leading New York Republican , " was a nice ' Irish widower from Brooklyn with 12 kids . But the next thing we know , the guy 's wearing $400 suits , dating Henry Fbrd 's daughter and eating God-knows-what at fancy restaurants . " Mr. Carey , in fact , managed to tag himself as both a playboy and a monk , no easy feat . His worst mistake , some of his own friends say , was the way he holed up in Al , bany and New York , working for an entire year on the New York City fiscal crisis , ignoring the rest of the state . " If he 'd Just visited Buffalo a couple of times in those early years , " one Democrat says , " he would n't have such a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary Anne Krupsak , was supposed to have filled in for him while he was tied up with other work . " I had a marketing manager , " Mr. Carey says , but then she ran against me . " Miss Krupsak split with Mr. Carey and ran as a c.arulielsarP for governor in the Sept. 12 Democratic ' primary . She picked up almost 34% of the vote , mostly upstate . Gov . Carey is expected to run poorly upstate on Nov. 7 and to run well in New York City , where voters doubt Mr. Duryea 's commitment to their future welfare . Thus , many observers believe , the election will be won or lost in the New York City suburbs . Mr. Carey is no admirer of California Gov . Brown , but the two men are similar in some ways . Both , for example , are Irish , and amateur psychologists like to make what they can of that . Both are moody and unpredictable . Both tend to make snap decisions . Both consult with unusual or at least nontraditional people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barzaghi , who once shaved his head and studied Zen . One of Gov . Carey 's closest advisers is Dr. Kevin Cahill , a specialist in tropical diseases who is said to have treated Pope Paul VI and dozens of heads of state . Jerry Brown dates Linda Ronstadt , the rock star ; Hugh Carey is seen with Anne Ford Uzielli , the jet setter . The most important similarity , though , is the way both men are able to stand back and look at themselves  --  and then shake their heads in disbelief at what they see . An Obsession With Acronyms There is in both of them an element of whimsy . Mr : Carey , for example , has an obsession with acronyms . His plan to help parents pay for their children 's education is called Parent Student Savings , or PASS . The other day , flying aimlessly over fogbound central New York , the governor spent most of his time trying to think of an acronym for the program he is developing to dispose of a $611 million surplus in the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his suggestions . At a press conference the next day , he trotted out his program . " I call it SLICE , " he said , looking directly at the reporters who had derided the whole idea , " for Suggested Levels of Constraints on Expenditures . " Accompanying it , he said , will be a program called ABLE ? he looked in the direction of the reporters again  --  standing for Assumption of Better Levels of Education ( for local schools and school districts 1 . Inventing SLICE and AMY . was about all the governor did that day . He was late getting started , as usual . He did manage to dedicate a veterans ' home near Binghamton , but in the process he gave a ringing salute to U.S. Rep. Matthew F. though he happened to be in Rep. James M. Hanley 's congressional district . The next day , he made up for all the wasted time by staging an extraordinary coup : He brought his old friend Nelson Rockefeller to Albany and almost won from the former GOP governor and his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did was set aside a day to dedicate the South Mall in the name of Nelson Rockefeller . The South Mall is Mr. Rockefeller 's grandest gesture ; it is a complex of 11 state buildings covering almost 98 acres and built at a cost of more than $1 billion . They had to finish it off with Georgia marble because Vermont ran out . Mrs. Rockefeller , when she arrived at the governor 's mansion , squeezed Mr. Carey 's arm and said he was " great to remember a remarkable man in his lifetime . " Mr. Rockefeller , at a brief press conference , said the people of New York had a right to be proud of Hugh Carey . " He likes the guy , " Mrs. Rockefeller chimed in . " That 's right . " said Mr. Rockefeller , the central figure in New York politics for 20 years , " I like him . " ( Mrs. Rockefeller , it seems , has n't forgiven Mr. Duryea 's outspoken wife , Bettie , for expressing some doubts about the wisdom of President Ford 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . Mr. Rockefeller has long nursed a grievance against Mr. Duryea for whacking his budget years ago . ) Mr. Rockefeller lavished more praise on Mr. Carey later at an outdoor ceremony . Mr. Duryea , the candidate of Mr. Rockefeller 's party , looked on from a back row , his face ashen . You would never guess from all this that Mr. Carey has suggested , without naming the former governor . that it was Mr. Rockefeller 's extravagant spending  --  which many people think is symbolized by the Mall  --  that almost brought the state to its knees . Spending is Mr. Carey 's best issue . He agrees that he cut back on state spending and saved New York City , Yonkers and maybe the entire state from bankruptcy . Saving the entire state , he says . " is the kind of thing you do when you 're alone and aloof . " In New York state , it is the Republicans . still wrestling with the Rockefeller legacy , who are on the defensive on state spending . Mr. Duryea said in that first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state had to spend vast sums just to bring its programs up to date . Mr. Duryea 's best issues are Mr. Carey 's personality and the death penalty . Mr. Carey opposes the death penalty ; Mr. Duryea is for it . The issue is an emotional one in New York state . Duryea strategists say their polls indicate that almost half the voters think it 's important enough to dictate the way they vote . Most of them , when they figure out where the candidates stand , come down on Mr. Duryea 's side , the polls say . Mr. Carey tries to respond by pointing to his crime package , one of the toughest in the nation . He says Mr. Duryea never showed much interest in the death penalty until he became a candidate for governor . Mr. Duryea responds by questioning Mr. Carey 's sincerity . Mr. Carey , he says , voted in Congress for the death penalty for airplane hijackers . But , says Mr. Carey . that was a treaty , not a bill , and almost everybody voted for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Duryea was asked in that first debate what he admired about Mr. Carey . He replied : " I respect Mr. Carey for focusing on a special problem  --  New York City  --  but he forgot all the rest of us. "
