txt ALBIA , Ia . ? Amtrak 's San Francisco Zephyr lurched to the left as the train sped through the countryside at 79 miles an hour near this hamlet 306 miles west of Chicago . " Damn , that was rough as a cob , " muttered Thomas J. Lamphier . It was a bad switch . But unlike other passengers shaken by the sudden lurch , Lamphier could do more than complain . He is not only a member of Amtrak 's board of directors , but president of the transportation division of Burlington Northern ? the nation 's longest railroad and owner of the track over which the Zephyr was traveling . FROM HIS OFFICE car on the rear of the train , Lamphier picked up the radio phone to talk to a Burlington road foreman riding in the locomotive . " Put a slow order on the turnout switch at milepost 313 . We should n't do more than 50 miles an hour over it , " ha commanded . " We break our back to run these trains safely and on time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat when they 're late . " Amtrak also has been taking its share of heat in the eight years since it was formed to take over the nation 's faltering rail passenger business . Transportation Department officials are attempting to drop the system 's worst money losing // Column 1 Amtrak exec rides train to check rail conditions // trains Sept. 30 , and passengers complain about bad equipment and late trains . ALTHOUGH AMTRAK officials say they have made improvements , their trains last year ran on time slightly less than 75 per cent of the time . In April and May of this year , Amtrak had an on-time record of less than 60 per cent . Records show the Burlington Northern , which operates nine passenger trains on various routes , has slipped in on-time performance over the last three years ? from 87.2 per cent in 1976 , to 72.1 per cent last year . Passenger trains are just one of the problems that railroad presidents face these days . They also get complaints from shippers when freight trains are late , from stockholders when profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulatory agencies when someone thinks conditions on the railroad are unsafe . TO KEEP AN EYE on all those factors , most railroad presidents spend a good deal of time each year riding on the rails on what are known as inspection trips . The trips are conducted on two or three " business cars " that each railroad owns ? a car with an open rear platform that looks like the observation cars familiar to railroad riders in the 1930s . However , the business cars are self . sufficient mobile offices equipped with their own bedrooms , dining rooms , kitchens , radios , telephones , and powerful lights to illuminate the track at night . " WE DO N'T OWN any airplanes because we want our executives out checking on the railroad when they travel , " said Larry Cena , president of the Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe Railway . " You ca n't do that from an airplane at 30,000 feet . " " I 'm a firm believer in inspections , " added Lamphier , who admits he does not particularly like flying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his business car , called the " Columbia River , " lifelong railroader Lamphier is in his element . From 7 a.m. to midnight or later each day he sat in the green and white painted car as it was pulled behind Amtrak and freight trains from Galesburg , Ill. , to Billings , Mont . HE CHASTISED E5IPLOYES whet something went wrong , complimented them when something was right , and ordered immediate changes when he thought them necessary . Mostly he just looked , listened , and took notes on the condition of the railroad ? things le would look into when he got back to hie headquarters in St. Paul . " I 'm looking for everything from hoe the local ( railroad ) superintendent performing to how the crops are grow hg , " said Lamphier . " Since we 're going to be called on to haul them away , we ought to know how they 're doing . I always check on safety . " This means especially bad track , lax enforcement of rules , or employe complaints . WHEN A FREIGHT train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped the car , hopped out , and carefully checked the train as it lumbered past . " All railroad employes are required to inspect passing trains for damage , and I am a railroad employe , " he said . A few miles down the line in Beardstown , HI. , he noticed 20 hopper cars loaded with coal waiting on a siding . " I 'll bet those 70-ton hoppers are overloaded . Get them weighed , " he ordered BN Assistant Supt. William Estes . " An overloaded car is unsafe . They could bum off a journal the bearing of the axle assembly ) and derail . " HUNDREDS OF MILES away near Broken Bow , Neb. , when a derailment delayed his freight train and threatened to cause the crew to go hungry that night , Lamphier invited two crew members to join him for dinner . Then he listened to what conductor Rich Sandberg had to say about the railroad . Early the next morning , when his train finally arrived in Alliance , Neb. , four hours late , Lamphier was taken on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive shops . " I notice you have n't spilled much fuel while refueling engines , " he told a local supervisor . " Everywhere I go on this railroad they spill fuel . That costs the company money . " DURING THE LONG hours the train was in motion and there was n't much to inspect , Lamphier sat in a lounge chair at a small desk at the rear of the business car and pored over a large stack of paperwork that was flown to him daily from railroad headquarters . The paperwork included such things as complaints from shippers , pay raises for employes , and reports on how Amtrack is performing . Lamphier , 55 , a Rochester , N.Y. , native and engineering graduate of Massachussets Institute of Technology , joined the Great Northern Railroad in 1949 as a surveyor helper . His rise through the ranks began in 1955 when he became the railroad 's resident expert on computerization ? then a coming thing in railroading . He ? was the Great Northern 's vice president of operations in March , 1970 , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burlington &; Quincy railroads to become the Burlington Northern . Seven years later , he was named president of the BN'a transportation division =man the man in charge of running the ilroad.
