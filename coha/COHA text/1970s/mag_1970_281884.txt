As a public figure in the forefront of the fight to better the U.S. environment , Secretary of the Interior Walter J. Hickel might have expected a friendly welcome at Princeton University last week . Environment , after all , has become the No. 1 issue on campus . Moreover , Hickel had prepared a speech that called for creation of " an environmental task force along the lines of the Peace Corps . " It would be called ECO ( an acronym for Environmental Control Organization ) , he said , and could start by conducting an exhaustive inventory of all publicly owned lands and making " recommendations for their highest use - whether it be recreational , or resource-producing , or just plain scenic . " <P> But some of the Princetonians seemed more interested in disruption than effective planning . Before the speech began , they handed out leaflets headlined HECKLE HICKEL , listing the shortcomings of the Secretary 's record . " What about the oil ? " they chanted in unison . " What about the Indians ? " " What about the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers-or to grant the Secretary his freedom of speech . In fact , they jeered so much that hardly anyone in the audience of 1,800 could hear Hickel say that improving the U.S. environment " will take a generation of men and women who will study both ecology and economics , biology and philosophy ; who are broad enough in their exposure to have a balanced judgment .
