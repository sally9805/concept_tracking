A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE by TENNESSEE WILLIAMS <P> A Streetcar Named Desire is 25 years old , and it might cogently be argued that it ranks first among all plays written anywhere during that time . Like all great works of art , it has been internalized . It is part of our sensibility , part of the way in which we see , feel , know and think about life . <P> The play 's leading characters , Stanley Kowalski and Blanche du Bois , symbolize the eternal struggle of earthy reality v. the romantic imagination , bestiality v. beauty . Of course , the symbols would possess little dramatic strength if the two characters were not vivid flesh-and-blood people . For the play to achieve its maximum emotional impact , much depends on a balance of forces and an electric tension between Stanley and Blanche . The Lincoln Center Repertory Theater revival is slightly , but naggingly off balance . <P> Inevitably , any actor who plays Kowalski has to cope with the memory of Marlon Brando in the original production . Brando not only exuded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal . In the current production , James Farentino seems like a deliberate lowbrow , a slob who relishes being a slob . He comes across as meanspirited , and the scene in which he ravishes Blanche becomes a sordid rape instead of the elemental encounter implied by " We 've had this date with each other from the beginning . " <P> He is not helped very much by Rosemary Harris , whose Blanche is not coquettish enough to suggest any sexual chemistry . She seems too exclusively fanciful ever to be emotionally vulnerable . Blanche 's sister Stella ( Patricia Conolly ) is born to the Southern man or , all right , but we have to take her visceral need for Husband Stanley on faith . Only Philip Bosco gives a performance of perfect pitch , as the shy wooer , " Mitch , " who almost marries Blanche until Stanley blurts out the story of her promiscuous past . <P> T.E.K.
