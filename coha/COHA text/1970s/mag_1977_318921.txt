It seemed like an enterprising piece of reporting : that the Irish Republican Army might have learned how to detonate terrorist bombs in Northern Ireland by remote radio signal . The story added , helpfully enough , that if British army technicians could learn what radio frequencies the I.R.A . used , the bombs could be detonated prematurely . <P> The article appeared last May in London 's Time Out , a trendy counterculture weekly , and the British government was apparently not amused . Last month Scotland Yard arrested two Time Out reporters , Crispin Aubrey , 31 , and Duncan Campbell , 24 , as well as a former British army signal corpsman , John Berry , 33 , for violating the 66-year-old Official Secrets Act . The arrests might have drawn only the usual left-wing cries of protest if the government had not two weeks earlier completed deportation hearings against another journalist , American-born Mark Hosenball , 25 , a former Time Out reporter now on the staff of London 's respected Evening Standard , and Philip Agee , 42 , a former Central Intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out stories on her majesty 's secret spooks ( TIME , Nov. 29 ) . Under British law , the government need not say precisely why Aubrey , Campbell , Berry , Hosenball and Agee are being punished , and the press is effectively prohibited from trying to find out . Says Ron Knowles , an official of Britain 's National Union of Journalists : " Journalism is becoming a high-risk occupation in this country . " <P> No Windsorgate . That is nothing new . Though Fleet Street 's influential national dailies are freighted with sex , scandal and scholarly dissertations on foreign policy , hard-digging investigative reporting is all but impossible . " Our law and our attitudes have been conditioned to defend free speech rather than free inquiry , " observes Editor Harold Evans , whose exceptionally aggressive Sunday Times has repeatedly incurred government wrath in the past decade . " It is all right to utter opinion but not to publish the supporting evidence . " Thus probably no British newspaper would have got away with a disclosure similar to the Washington Post 's report last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Newswatch ) . Nor is it likely that a British version of the Pentagon papers or the Watergate scandals would ever have seen the light of print . <P> One problem is that Britain has no equivalent of First Amendment guarantees of press freedom . Instead , British journalists face a daunting obstacle course of legal restrictions : 1 ) strict libel laws that allow even notorious public figures to win damages for disclosures that in the U.S. would not be considered actionable ; 2 ) stringent contempt-of-court rules under which a journalist can be jailed for any original reporting about a matter that is sub judice , that is , before a court ; 3 ) the principle of " confidence , " which protects from disclosure industrial secrets and other private information that would be considered fair game in the U.S. ; and 4 ) the so-called D ( for defense ) notices , which are issued by the government as advance warnings that stories about certain subjects would be harmful to national defense . Though the notices are not legally binding , editors almost always take them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraint that in the U.S. would probably be ruled unconstitutional .
