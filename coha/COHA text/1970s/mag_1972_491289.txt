It was jazz , with its freewheeling improvisations which first brought untutored black musicians of great talent to a society which up until then had been exposed only to music in traditional , classical and popular forms . Jazz was a new language , a new pulse , and it was exciting . Far from being a transient phenomenon , it grew into a permanent part of our lives , whether we were aware of such an influence or not . Its forms came to be known as ragtime , cool , mod , country , rock , folk , and **25;3293;TOOLONG , Not one of these would have strayed beyond the purlieus of a museum ( where folk would have remained , close to the exhibits of ancient instruments ) or a garret ( where mod might have stayed in containment to the despair of the electronics industry ) without the freedoms of form which jazz established by its sheer vitality and purity of musical expression . Symphony conductors were proud to utter asides about jazz to prove their expertise . Critics made an entire career of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers of classical music today are blessed by jazz impulses . The music of Bach and Mozart is being arranged to a modern beat with a musicality and taste which those great masters themselves would have commended . They were subsidized by church and court because they had to be to survive , but their thrust was a popular one and they wrote music in their hearts for all people . And , happily , that music lives today more popularly than ever before in concert hall and record shop . In the midst of all this expansion and growth into related forms , there was a nucleus of pure jazz which held to its own . Its best practitioners never wavered from that first form . Some of them were geniuses in the raw , so expert musically that Finished classic virtuosos would shake their heads in despair of the techniques of a humble jazz man in a New Orleans back parlor who could n't even write his own name , but could fashion music suited to heavenly choirs . And this original kind of jazz has drawn to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understanding which makes the word cult seem a sigh of indifference by comparison , Jazz buffs and students are lovers of their avocation , if indeed . they have not made it into a vocation . It is with them night and day , it sings in their veins , and they speak of it softly and in the tones of a father describing his newborn babe . This is a land of high spirits and moody poetry , pure joy and encompassing sorrow . And here we have the chance to meet some of its heroes  --  although they do not think of themselves as such  --  in the flesh and in the winging world of their music . What brings this all together in one piece is a man , Dick Gibson , who is a highly successful Denver businessman with a lifelong affection for jazz . Most jazz-crazy people collect records . A few prefer old ones , the mouldier the better . But Gibson declares that he only enjoys jazz live . So , being a man of action and means , he started The World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The band ? WGJB , to brief it ? may or may not live up to its ear-filling title , but it sure is mighty close . You must hear it with the naked ears ( binaural listening , which God invented long ago ) to understand what these musicians can accomplish . Their drive is phenomenal . Their pitch is a thing of beauty . They play their instruments with casual perfection . Put it all together , and you have thousands of listeners thronging to listen , just listen , to WGJB , in crowded performances all over the United States . What Mr. Gibson has done has won him the plaudits not only of the inside jazz world but also those reasonably innocent of what exposure to true jazz can do to the heart and spirit . They too have discovered something perhaps they did not know before  --  jazz is also an intellectual exercise . Men who play it do not necessarily have to have degrees in higher physics , but their knowledge of the mathematics of the beat , and the uses of sound vibrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you choose to slur it ) is Einsteinian in practice . All this leads us to the bash which Mr. Gibson recently threw in the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs as part of his WGJB project . This party began at three p.m. on a Saturday and lasted until six p.m. on the following Monday . it is hard to understand how anybody , musician or civilian , could survive all this exuberant and mournful noise . But there are sada-masochistic souls whose only wish is to get through until Tuesday . The responsibilities they feel are toward their commitments to their crafts as expressed through their instruments . They are talking for themselves . Let others listen if they will : it does not matter . And so let usjoin them . // The scene is interpreted by artist John Falter , whose unfaltering brush has delighted Post readers with many a cover and illustration . Text insights are provided by author Richard Gehman , whose book on Eddie Condon is a classic in the field , and who has written literally hundreds of authoritative articles on jazz . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jazz , and of the faces so familiar to the in-people of jazz , this interpretation may come as a fresh experience : to those in the know , it will be a romp with old friends . John Falter , a driving jazz pianist in his own right , made his sketches right at the Broadmoor during the party , balancing on his knee a portable drawing desk of his own design  --  the lines sketched as a kind of a corona around the head of Benny Carter , in fact , were drawn ( as John tells it ) to the beat of one of the band 's most exciting numbers , and he finished with them , slashing the last line precisely at the last beat . Dick Gehman knows whereof he speaks and whomof he speaks , after traveling with most of these musicians and being one of them so many times over the years . He has deliberately written into his style some of the pace and rhythms of the music itself . Make the scene then , with Falter &; Gehman , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jazz . The moment is now ; the voice is that of Dick Gehman : Forty-odd men are standing in a wide hall behind the ballroom of the venerable Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs . They are practitioners of jazz , all bent on expressing man 's joy in his existence , and trying to let man know that they feel for his sorrows and regrets . Nine of these men are WGJB members . Most jazzmen spend their intermissions in dingy rooms illuminated by a bare sixty-watt bulb on a black cord that hangs down glowing coldly , but trying to be warm . In the Broadmoor hall , there are sparkling chandeliers illuminating the seamy and war-torn , which means " jazz-torn , " faces of these gentle and unassuming men . There are some Victorian chairs scattered along the hall , but few of this band of venturing strollers are sitting on them . Jazz musicians seldom sit down . Their messages make them too nervous for that . The men stand there , naked instruments under their hands or under their arms , cups of gin or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less aimlessly discussing what they will play next .... What about the old One-Step ? one asks . No , NO , says another . He reconsiders . Weil , maybe . It 's just about the same tune as Georgia Cake Walk . We could work that into it , I guess . The musicians who play jazz do not talk much . They go about their work , which is collective improvisation upon a given theme , and solos springing up out of the collectivity , and never think about what they are trying to do . They know only that they are doing it , and that 's enough for them . Jazz parties and jazz festivals have been a part of the American scene for close to thirty-five years . Some millionaires have had the habit of backing them , knowing that the musicians always have been underpaid and that the men on the stand can give them a release from the troubles they endure or foresee . This habit is better than junk or pot . Zutty Singleton , a drummer born in Runkle , Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dread Weed . What he has been on is drums . His life has been enhanced by them . The drums are his drugs ; they help him get through the day . He does n't need anything else . Zutty is not here at this session , but only because he does n't wish to leave his apartment in the Alvin Hotel in New York . Jazzmen become independent after a time . When people from anywhere beyond French Lick call them to come and play , they say , " Sorry , man . I'mtied up here in The Apple . " ( Do I have to explain that The Apple  --  The Big Apple  --  is New York ? I think not . ) There is a story that needs to be told here , illustrating the independence of the jazz musician . For a time , about ten years ago , the vibraphone player Lionel Hampton , acclaimed by jazz lovers the king of his instrument , would not go to Europe . " I wo n't fly and I wo n't go on no boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They want you bad there , " she said . " If they want me there so bad , let them figure it out , " The Hamp said . Hamp has not been invited to this session because vibes jangle Dick Gibson 's nerves . Gibson can not explain why . Gibson prefers the rich , brassy sound of the WGJB ; it soothes his nerves , he claims . It also leads him into backing these concerts , with the help of his many friends and the outsiders who keep banging on the gate hoping to get in . Now , in the Broadmoor , Billy Butterfield stands in the hallway . Billy plays trumpet . It would be more accurate to say that he uses his horn as a penetrating weapon . When he was on the road , that dismal and never-ending road that all jazz musicians are consigned by fate to follow , he drank a lot purely for the sake of survival . Now he is as dry as could be imagined , and has gained weight . He resembles that little dough man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of lungs that make blacksmiths around Rescue , Virginia  --  where he lives when not on the road  --  wish they could get him to blow for them , on the theory that he has the right embouchure for bellows jobs , and that his talent is being wasted on the trumpet . It is n't being wasted . Billy generates all his fellows to greater efforts in The World 's Greatest Jazz Band . He is standing with Yank Lawson , another trumpet player , who looks like a veteran Wisconsin U tackle . Yank is draining the spit out of his trumpet . From Trenton , Missouri , Yank has been playing with the big bands  --  Benny Goodman 's , Tommy Dorsey 's , Bob Crosby 's , the lot  --  for over twenty-one years . He plays as though determined to blow that loud drunk out there on the barstool off it . In the entire history of jazz , there seldom has been a more vigorous or assertive trumpeter . Yank is assertive only on the stand . Other times , he is modest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas Billy 's is higher ( although it sometimes goes down to a growl ) ; together they make a splendid pair . One of Yank 's friends nicknamed him The Iron Chancellor . Other members of the WGJB are around . The trombone men are oiling the slides of their instruments . Vic Dickenson , from Xenia , Ohio , who began playing in 1922 before he made the big-time bands in 1927 , is cutting up old touches and times with Benny Carter , who had starred Vic in his band in 1940 . Vic brings a rough , gruff , tough tone from his horn , a tone which unexpectedly can turn so soft it is as though two different men were working on it . He is a slender , wiry cat with huge brown eyes overhung by epicanthic lids . Sometimes , on the bell of his trombone , he will hang an old felt hat instead of his mute . The other trombonist is apple-cheeked by comparison with Vic Dickenson . Eddie Hubble , christened John Edgar Hubble , born in Santa Barbara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young musician to get admitted to the closed shop of jazz , especially with the handicap of a name like Eddie Hubble . Nevertheless , Hubble has survived // and , in fact , flourished into a talent . His trombone style is a bit more lyrical than that of Dickenson , but together they make an excellent team . Near one doorway in the hall , the two reed men , Bob Wilber ( clarinet and soprano saxophone ) and Bud Freeman ( tenor saxophone ) are adjusting , or fiddling with , the reeds on their instruments . Never in thirty-five years of bumming around with jazzmen have I seen one playing a reed instrument who was not fumbling with his reed between sets . Messing around with a reed is a jazzman 's occupational tic . The trumpeters and trombonists worry about their mouthpieces ; they find a reliable salesman who will give them one that rests easily on their lips or against their teeth , and that is the end of it No matter how many horns they wear out , they keep using the same mouthpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seem to be satisfied . Bud Freeman , a stocky man with hair only on the sides of his head and not too much of that , is putting a new reed on the business endof his tenor saxophone . Bud  --  Lawrence  --  has been playing his horn with grace and agility for fifty-one years . He still plays much as he did when he was in his teens in his birthplace , Chicago , in the early twenties . Then he was a member of the Austin High group of jazzmen , with the legendary Frank Teschemacher and Jimmy McPartland . Tesch died in 1932 in a car accident . Jimmy is still alive and as unrelenting as he was forty-odd years ago . He plays as if every note that comes out of his trumpet might be his last . So does Bud . Jazz keeps its players young . Pops Armstrong was seventy-one when he died in 1971 , and was still performing until a few days before the illness that took him off . George Lewis , whose musical career extended back to the pre-jazz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eighty-seven , when he finally turned his face to the wall . Bob Wilber is dissatisfied with his reed , as well . There never has been a clarinetist who has not had reed trouble . Pee Wee Russell , the late clarinetist , was continually plagued by the reed problem . 1 went to see him one night a few years ago . He was in the back room of a 52nd-Street nightclub , tears streaming down and spotting his dinner jacket . " 1 was sorry to hear about your dog and your wife , " I said . " It was n't those who 're making me cry this way , " Pee Wee said . " I ca n't get my reed straight ? ' Pee Wee used to be late getting on the stand three times out of five because he could not make his reed obedient . In the old Nick 's , at 7th Avenue and 10th Street in New York , Pee Wee always had a music stand in front of him . Some one asked him what he had on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Charles Ellsworth Russell . Actually , he kept a list of the tunes he and the rest of the lads played , each carefully marked with their separate keys , so he would not forget them . Gus Johnson , Jr. , the drummer , is swiping a pair of drum brushes against the sides of his pants , in anticipation of what the WGJB will play next , after the men have made up their minds . Drummers seldom have their own say in these matters . They are on the stand to act like obedient beasts , nodding the others into the barn of jazz with their rhythmic lowings , low but insistent , and seldom do they call a tune . They depend on the decisions of the horn players and follow suit , beating out the called beat and trying to stimulate the horn men to greater endeavors in their quest for new fields that can be explored . The essence of this music is inquiry . The men all seem to feel that they will die if they do not make the note they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Sherwood ) Haggart , who was born in Douglaston  --  no , born in New York City but raised in D. , Long Island , New York . Bob began on banjo , went from there to guitar , and then progressed to piano and trumpet , and finally to bass . The bass always has been his main instrument . He and the drummer Ray Bauduc , in the thirties , joined together in " Big Noise from Winnetka , " one of the only drums-and-bass solos ever recorded . Haggart , who is fifty-seven , could be a college freshman going out on his first date . He plays the bass as though he wants to get his girl off the dance floor and back to what they used to call " the frat house . " With the exception of the late Walter Page , who died in 1957 , there never has been a more exciting bassist in jazz . Haggart is the arranger for the WGJB , which is to say that he writes out " charts . " All these chaps know their tunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not need written music , for that would interfere with their spontaneity . But Bob has taken the responsibility for at least writing out sketches for them all to follow , allowing each to go his own way when he feels like it . It occurs to me , when I listen to this band , that jazz music truly expresses America as nothing else does ; it is collective , yes , but it allows individual voices to be heard in the hall . Heard as long as they feel the desire to blast . Ralph Sutton , the piano man with the WGJB , is over to one side of the wide hall . He is not fooling with his eighty-eight keys , for after all it would be a good deal of trouble to lug them and their box in . Sutton could do that , for he is a tall man , broad of chest and shoulders , who looks slight and shy until he gets at his instrument . When he does , he towers over it and seems so stern and commanding one could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossing it on , saying , " Stay there until the next gig . 91 Sutton was born in Hamburg , Missouri , in 1922 . He played with local bands around St. Louis until Jack Teagarden , that mighty trombone man , discovered him at a college prom at The Kirksville State Teachers ' College , in Kirksville , Missouri . Until then , Kirksville had been noted for its osteopathic programs . Now it is known for having given the world Ralph Sutton . Now , while the men are taking their breather , Dick Gibson materializes in the hall , a shy but well-fed wraith . A sturdily built man of forty-six , he has been in Colorado long enough to have lost the Mobile , Alabama , accent he picked up when he learned to talk . Most jazz promoters are entrepreneurs in black suits who look like sons of the William Morris Agency . Gib-son looks like an investment banker and a beardless Santa Claus . and in fact has been , and is , both : he earned enough from the investment business to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They all are good old friends . The musi-cians do not respect Gibson so much for his money as they do for his liking for jazz . His invitation to the dance  --  or , rather , the listening  --  had read , in part : " We will have 500 guests this year . Our charge , as last year , is $62.50 per person , or $125.00 per couple . . . " The party 's budget this year is $30,800 . Thus , there is a slight margin for error against cost overrun , a not unheard-of phenomenon . This margin is in addition to our customary budgetary item of $800 for Miscellaneous Costs Neither Predictable Nor Even imaginable . There is a touch of the supernatural in the ways jazzmen can spend money . " No jazzman  --  that is to say , no cat  --  would dispute that statement . Jazzmen always have liked to play the horses , possibly because they had jobs in Saratoga Springs , Miami , and New Orleans , as well as Bar Harbor ; where the millionaires went , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what the jazzman calls himself , always has been a scavenger and , en fin , a loser . He has had to go to loan companies , hock shops , and other dealers to buy himself out of penury . He never has known security in any form , and never has been able to buy himself into it . Bankers and proprietors of finance companies frown when an applicant says he is a " jazz musician . " They go and consult their office bosses , who also frown and shake their heads . In reality , the men in the WGJB are married and responsible husbands and fathers , all of whom are anxious to keep their kids from going into jazz . Back to the hallway . The men are ready to go back on the stand . Dick Gibson has announced that it is time . Although he has permitted many of Continued on page 133 his 500 guests to come to meet his invited stars , he has chased them all hack into the ballroom to get into their proper chairs . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linger offstage like prisoners waiting for an execution that will follow . There will be only the execution of jazz songs , and the men will begin it without looking at each other . The WGJB has no leader . It needs none . Its music comes out after one jazzman looks at another , they nod without speaking , and they get onto it , everybody falling in without anything resembling hesitation , except that hesitation expressed in the old " Hesitation Walk . " As mentioned before , this music is joyous and exuberant , but it also can become chillingly mournful . The sounds of the slaves of the New Orleans swamps are in it , the exuberance of the colored folk who found their way to Chicago and then went on to New York : all these are expressed and overtoned elsewhere by such geniuses as Duke Ellington and Count Basie , who in their orchestras have taken the word of jazz around the world . Neither Basie nor Ellington is here tonight , but many of their alumni are . This is a meeting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Harry Edison 13.1 is here , and so is Barney Bigard When you cone to play with WGJB. you 'll have to he among the men who already are in , or about to be in , the Jazz Hall of Fame . Dick Gibson selects only the best of the strollers around . It is my opinion that he ought to go a little farther afield , next year , bring in Stephan Grapelly from France , Mick Mulligan from England , and Sleepy Matsumoto from Japan . This year he has brought Dr. Lyn Christie from Australia , a fine bassist who can hold his own with the Americans . He is the only stranger in the group , but with one pluck of his strings he establishes the fact that he knows what jazz is about and w hat it will continue to be about . Born in I he slums of New Orleans , the language of jazz reaches every human heart and mind and every inhuman one . There is , around my house , a trio of cats who spend a good deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yowling until I put on a jazz record . Nobody forced them to go up there . Nobody even invited them to go up there . They understand , and are consoled by , the argot of jazz , as are millions of people around the world .
