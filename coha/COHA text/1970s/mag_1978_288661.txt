Or , Love 's Labors Lost , a Washington comedy of manners <P> Edward Zorinsky , 49 , is a Nebraska businessman , an instinctive booster who with bounce and bluster became the Republican mayor of Omaha . Two years ago , seeing an opportunity for greater things , he turned Democrat and captured a seat in the U.S. Senate . He attracted little notice , however , until last month , when it became known that he was undecided about how to vote on the Panama Canal treaties and that a handful of undecided Senators would soon decide the issue . TIME Correspondent Neil Mac Neil reports the consequences : <P> President Carter invited Senator Zorinsky to come to the White House for a private chat . " I 'm counting on your support , " he said . <P> " It 's more important to convince the people I represent than me , " replied Zorinsky . " They 're the ones who sent me here . " <P> All right , said the President . If Zorinsky would provide a list of 250 Nebraskans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefing . Delighted , Zorinsky provided the names , and 190 Nebraskans showed up at the White House a week later , to be greeted at the door by Rosalynn Carter . She shook hands with each one . <P> " That , " said Zorinsky , " was above and beyond the call of duty . " <P> Zorinsky was in his element . He sat and heard the President , the Joint Chiefs , the top State Department people , all brief his friends . <P> " The President made a total , all-out effort , " said Zorinsky . But that did n't persuade him . <P> Then the telephone calls began . <P> Bob Strauss , the marvelously witty U.S. trade negotiator , telephoned Zorinsky , arguing the President 's case . Secretary of State Cyrus Vance invited him to the State Department and briefed him for a full hour on the importance of the treaties . <P> Two weeks ago the White House telephoned again . Marshal Tito was in town . Would the Senator and his wife Cece favor the President with their presences at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's table , " said Ed Zorinsky . <P> Next came National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski , who briefed Zorinsky anew , this time on the possible impact of a Panama defeat on the NATO alliance . Then Sol Linowitz , the treaty negotiator , invited him to play a game of tennis-and let him win . <P> " I do n't know , " said the confused I 'd Zorinsky , " whether it was my tennis prowess or his lobbying . " <P> Still , the Senator had not convinced himself . He was not sure . <P> <P> " As a businessman I have made errors , " he said . " I do n't want to make an error on this vote . It 's too important . " <P> The Administration did n't give up on him . The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Omaha , Daniel Sheehan , telephoned at White House request , asking Zorinsky to cast his vote for the treaties . The White House signaled Henry Kissinger , and the former Secretary of State was soon purring in Zorinsky 's ear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate defeat of the treaties could adversely affect the value of the dollar in international trade . Vice President Walter Mondale , of course , talked to him . Repeatedly . This was getting to be heady stuff , and Zorinsky loved it . <P> " I 've heard from everyone but my mother , " he chortled .
