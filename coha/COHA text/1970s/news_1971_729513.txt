txt Going to East Pakistan after a week in West Bengal is like walking through the looking glass . Suddenly everything is reversed . what you were told in Calcutta about fleeing refugees becomes untrue in the Dacca version of events . Similar reversals apply to all the other great problems that beset Pakistan today . You begin to wonder which side is the world of reality and which of fantasy  --  and whether the Mad Hatter is the information officer on the Pakistani or Indian side of the border . This might be ludicrous if so much were not at stake on both sides . There is the plight of the miserable tide of humanity which swept out of East Pakistan into the eastern provinces of India . And there is Pakistan 's reputation before the world , which has been heavily impugned during the recent months of internal strife and dislocation . So one comes here  --  among the first foreign correspondents to be readmitted  --  to see for oneself . What refugees ? Here and in Karachi what everyone in India calls refugees are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaced persons ? " poor , mistaken people who listened to false propaganda , - then panicked and fled out of sheer fear when they need not have left at all . " Here they say displaced persons are welcome to return regardless of caste , creed , or religion . Pakistan 's President Yahya Khan himself has said so . And some are indeed coming back  --  according to government reports  --  although the numbers still are in the low thousands compared with the millions who fled . India , however , is accused here of holding refugees by shipping them to the interior on the grounds that border area camps are overcrowded . To Dacca from Karachi by air now takes over six hours  --  almost as long as a North Atlantic crossing  --  because Pakistan 's planes must detour around the entire Indian subcontinent to span the 1,200 miles between the two wings of Pakistan . Below , the fields shimmer with water , and one remembers the great cyclone and tidal wave that devastated the Ganges estuary only last November . // *Fact and fantasy switch at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest calamity that could hit this area . Yet within months this catastrophe of nature was exceeded in misfortune by a manmade disaster that already has altered the lives of millions , brought India and Pakistan close to conflict , and threatened the stability of South Asia . At the Dacca air terminal , where last November throngs of Pakistani spectators crowded airport corridors and lined the railings of a rooftop lookout both night and day , there now are no spectators . Dacca Airport is-lin6U guarded and restricted to persons actually arriving and departing : It no longer is for those who wish to watch in idle curiosity planes and passengers coming and going . On the way into town taxi fare has doubled in the past six months . The driver complains that gasoline prices have risen and business is poor . Traffic is half what it was formerly  --  and all the roadside clutter and jumble of carts , cars , buses and stalls has been swept away . It is neater , quieter , cleaner  --  but it is not the Dacca of old . Dacca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deserted city . This is not true . It is not deserted ; but it does appear greatly diminished in population and activity . Downtown traffic is light compared with before the trouble started . Such surface differences as these are easy to spot  --  and perhaps not all that significant . Much more difficult is sorting out the serious but utterly divergent claims of Pakistan 's government on one sideand its critics in Calcutta and New Delhi on the other . Pakistanis feel they have had a bad press in the outside world . They realize some of this is due to the high-handed manner in which the foreign press was ejected from Dacca at the height of the Bangla Desh uprising . A few may even concede that the restrictions of prolonged martial rule had something to do with it . But now the government has decided to let overseas newsmen in again to see for themselves . There has , of course , been considerable time for the Army and military government to tidy things up and prepare cogent answers to obvious questions . " I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan , " said the girl who wrote my airline ticket in Karachi . " You Americans have been biased against us so far . " She had reached her judgment on the basis of controlled Pakistan press reports and reading two United States news magazines every week . " I hope you wo n't write about Bangla Desh in your stories . " A British businessman just returned from Dacca said in Calcutta , " There is no Bangla Desh except in the imagination of some political exiles in Calcutta . East Pakistan is a going concern today . Bangla Desh is not . " It is true Bangla Desh is not visible as a going concern on East Pakistan soil at present . But it manages to make its presence known nevertheless . Bomb blast described Only moments before , the same businessman had been telling me how he and his chum narrowly missed injury just outside their Dacca hotel when several grenade bombs went off . They had bits of shrapnel to show for their near miss . Somebody out there in the night was making known his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hotel now has security police on constant duty . As further evidence of some continuing Bangla Desh activity , one also hears  --  without confirmation  --  that a small but steady stream of military and civilian casualties reach Dacca Hospital daily .
