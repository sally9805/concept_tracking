txt Hundreds of policemen throughout the city , angered by a State Court of Appeals decision yesterday ordering a trial in their pay-parity case , refused to go out on patrol last night and early today in a spreading wildcat work stoppage . Wide areas of the Bronx , Brooklyn , upper Manhattan and Staten Island had only scant patrols on the streets throughout the night . At 1:45 AM. , an official of the Patrolmen 's Benevolent Asspciation , which did not endorse the walkout , said : " There is no patrolman working outside of a precinct station house in the city of New York tonight . " Shortly thereafter , a Police Department spokesman said : " In some cases , as the P.B.A. reports , there are some precincts where they only have one or two patrolmen working . The other precincts could have a full complement . " ' Shortages Vary Earlier , telephone checks of dozens of station houses indicated that there were manpower shortages in most precincts , varying from a few men on duty to full complements . Detectives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  were ordered on 12- to 16-hour shifts and assigned to patrol duties in the affected areas . All days off were canceled and administrative work was suspended . The headquarters spokesman said that all emergency calls were being answered , A check of hospitals and private detective agencies during the night gave no indication of in , . creasing emergencies . Mayor Lindsay , who met with his staff into the early morning hours , issued statements appealing to the patrolmen to return to work and assuring that the public safety would be protected at all costs . He scheduled City Hall meetings with the Police Depart- tent 's top commandors for 9 . A.M. today . A spokesman at Police Headquarters said that nearly all 77 precincts in the city had been affected , but he said there was no way of immediately determining how many of the roughly 5,000 patrolmen on each of the night tours  --  the 4-to-midnight and midnight-to-5 A.M. ? were refusing to work . Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy , who was vacationing in Florida , was reported on his way back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Guard were prepared last month in the event of a work stoppage by policemen , firemen and sanitationmen on New Year 's Day . A spokesman for the National Guard 's 42d ( Rainbow ) Division said last night that , while no alert had been issued , a liaison man had been sent to police headquarters and the unit was prepared to supplerelent police operations if ordered to do so byGovernor Rockefeller . The policemen said they were upset because the court ruling put off indefinitely , and raised doubts about , payment of the $2,700-a-man retroactive pay they had counted on under terms of their old contract with the city . What the Court of Appeals did was reverse decisions of lower courts holding that the ' city was legally bound by an agreement under which the Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association had claimed a $100-amonth increase for its membership . The work stoppage began in six precincts in Brooklyn , the Bronx and Queens , when scores of policemen failed to turn out for duty at 4 P.M. A short time after the patrolmen declined to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 30,000-member Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association , announced that the organization had broken off contract negotiations with the city . He said a special meeting of P. B. A. delegates would be held Tuesday to decide what action to take , " Whatever the delegates decide to do on Tuesday morning , " he said , The P. B. A. will do together , And that is the way we should do this , men ? together . " I ask those of you who are considering job action tonight to do your job instead . It will be difficult , i know , doing your job when you know that all the forces of power in this city and the state  --  the Mayor , the newspapers and the courts ? are against you . " But I ask you to swallow it for four more days . If action must be taken , I ask that we The Now York Times Thomas B. Morgan , Mayor Lindsay 's press secretary , at Grade Mansion last night . He read Mayor 's statement on walkout. do it together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Some policemen in the Bronx and in the Brooklyn South Patrol Force , however , had gone ahead with their own job action without waiting to hear Mr. Kiernan 's statement , made on television at 6 P.M. First reports of the job action ' n the late afternoon said that only the 43d Precinct in the Bronx , the 100th in Queens and four Brooklyn precincts-68 , 72 , 78 and 84 ? had been affected . Later men of the 43d , 68th and 100th returned to patrol . A P.B.A. delegate , after a meeting with patrolmen at the 19th precinct station , on East 67th Street , said that the men were " disgusted " by the court ruling and that morale was " low . " Throughout the night the job action spread , despite directives from the leadership of the Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association to return to work . The Transit Authority police said they were having trouble because there were few city policemen available to complete arrests in the transit system . An officer at headquarters said he was having trouble checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , a large contingent of special Tactical Patrol Force officers was on hand at the Soviet mission to the United Nations , where a Jewish Defense League demonstration drew a large crowd . The 19th pahcinct station , across the street , did not have the manpower to handle it . In the Bronx , the job action affected large areas . At the 40th Precinct , covering the South Bronx , Capt . Francis J. McCormack said seven of 14 patrol cars were riot working , He called the situation " serious . " A desk sergeant at the station house of the 41st Precinct , covering Hunts Point , said that " out of 75 to 100 men on the 4-to-12 A.M. shift no one went out on the street . " The patrol cars are " all parked , " he said . The 45th Precinct , covering the northeast Bronx , was " 100 per cent out , " according to a police spokesman , who added that " none of the patrol cars are running , " A police spokesman at the 47th Precinct station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars were on the street . About 40 men on the 4-to-midnight shift went to work on time , but returned about 8 P.M. to the station house , refusing to work . In the 50th Precinct covering the Riverdale section , more than 30 of the 40 men on the night tour participated in the job action . A spokesman said four patrol cars were at work . At the 43d Precinct , only four of 40 men were working on the night tour , according to a desk officer . In Brooklyn , the effectiveness of the wildcat walkout was mixed . The 68th Precinct in Bay Ridge was reported at 11 P.M. to have only two radio cars manned for emergency runs , with only eight of 45 men on the job . Just to the north , in the Park Slope section , a spokesman for the 72d Precinct reported , " We are the same as the 68th . " The 84th Precinct , covering Brooklyn Heights , reported that the entire 4-to-midnight shift of 30 men failed to turn out and superior officers were handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85 per cent of the evening shift were participating in the work stoppage . A spokesman said there were " just a few patrol cars on the street , " The adjacent 81st Precinct in East New York had " less than half " the normal complement of men on the job . In Manhattan , the northern precincts were widely affected , but a survey indicated that most patrolmen were on their beats in midtown and downtown . A Major Exception The major exception in midtown was the 18th precinct covering Times Square and the West Side , where a lieutenant said : " There just about Is no precinct . We have a few sergeants who are going to cover a few sectors , and I 'm going to take a radio car out , and that 's it . " said , " all went home . " The East Harlem area covered by the 25th Precinct was being patrolled by sergeants and superior officers , with " 100 per cent participation by the patrolmen in the job action , " according to a desk officer , On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven supervising officers and a handful of detectives , were on duty . All patrolmen assigned to the island had refused to work , according to a ' headquarters spokesman . Mr. Kiernan , in his statement , said he shared the disgust of the patrolmen and their disappointment in the Court of Appeals decision " to pass the buck , instead of trying to say that a contract is a contract . " " I share your outrage that the politicians , from Mayor Lindsay on down , in cooperation with the press , put on a long publicity campaign of poverty in an attempt to influence the courts ' against you . " The decision of the Court of Appeals was announced in Albany in mid-afternoon and immediately threw the already complicated negotiations between the city and its uniformed services into turmoil , There was speculation that the decision might result in a delay of months in settlement of currently pending contract negotiations . The Court of Appeals , in its 4-to-3 decision yesterday , expressed no opinion on the validity of the patrolmen 's payparity ' agreement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , fact " was involved , This , in effect , sent the case back to the State Supreme Court , Basis of P.B.A. Claim J. Lee Rankin , the city 's Corporation Counsel , declined comment on yesterday 's decision until he had read it . Herbert L. Haber , Director of Labor Relations for the city , also declined to comment . The Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association had contended that a contract negotiated in 1968 and early 1969 with the city provided that the pay of patrolnien should be maintained at a ratio of 3 to 3.5 with police sergeants . It filed its claim for $100 a month in retroactive increases after the sergeants received a wage increase that changed the ratio . The patrolmen said in their suit that the agreement ? initialed , Jan. 29 , 1969 , by their representative and a representative of the city , and containing the guarantee of continuance of the 3:3.5 ratio  --  was a legally binding collective-bargaining agreement , The city argued that this agreement was simply a preliminary step in negotiations leading to " a formal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such contract . Supreme Court Justice Nathaniel T. Heiman last summer , and the Appellate Division in October in a 3-to-2 decision , agreed with the P. B. A .. They held that the case could be determined as a matter of law rather than one in which there was a factual issue . The Court of Appeals disagreed . The majority opinion of the Court of Appeals said that the issue was whether it was the intention of the two sides that " the accord as to part of the subjects of negotiation should become an independent agreement " or , as the city said , that " there should be further and ultimate formalization in writing . " This , it said , was " an issue of fact . " This opinion was written by Judge Francis Bergen and concurred in by Judges Charles D. Breitel , Matthew Jasen and James Gibson . In dissenting , Chief Judge Stanley H. Fuld and Judges Adrian P. Burke and John F. Scileppi said : " Contrary to intimations in the city 's argument , no one could seriously urge a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be embodied in a formal document and that neither party is bound by its terms until each has signed and executed it . " The Uniformed Firefighters Association , which instituted a job action of its own for several days at the start of the year , and the Uniformed Sanitationmen 's Association are ' also negotiating contracts with the city . The contracts of all three unions expired Dec. 31 , but the patrolmen , sanitationmen and the firemen  --  except for the latter 's job action ? have continued to work , All three have been seeking substantial pay increases , better pensions , and improved fringe benefits . The patrolmen have been asking for an increase from the present $10,950 a year to $16 , - 000 , with retirement at full pay after 25 years . The firemen are asking a 30 per cent increase , the same as for the police , and retirement at half pay after 15 years and full pay after 25 years .                   @ @
