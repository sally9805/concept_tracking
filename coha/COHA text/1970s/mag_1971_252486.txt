As he celebrates his 39th birthday this week , Edward M. Kennedy enjoys a unique political vista : theoretically at least , he could be running for President in the elections of 1992 , when he will be merely a mellow 60 . <P> Many professionals in both parties , however , suspect that Kennedy will try much earlier , even as early as next year . Kennedy has repeated that his only ambition now is to serve the full six years of his new Senate term . But political plans are never absolute . Despite the tragedy at Chappaquiddick Island 19 months ago , despite the embarrassing loss of his job a month ago as Senate whip , Kennedy 's potential Democratic opponents will fix him with an apprehensive eye all the way through the 1972 convention . So will Richard Nixon . A Gallup poll released in January showed Muskie and Nixon running even with 44% of the vote each ; but Kennedy , despite his setbacks , still drew 38% against Nixon 's 47% . <P> No Promise . Kennedy , who looked lean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regained his sense of humor . In an interview with TIME Correspondent Hays Gorey , he mused about his personal and political life : " In the recent past I suppose I 've had more than my share of tragedy and disappointment . The pendulum swings wide , and when it does , you develop an ability to live with these changes . " Kennedy dismissed the widely published rumor that he had promised his 80-year-old mother , Rose , to run for President during her lifetime . Nor does Kennedy credit the theory , held by some of his close friends , that he has subconsciously tried to escape the possibility of the presidency , partly because of the fate of his brothers . The episode at Chappaquiddick , according to this elaborate speculation , was a subconscious effort to destroy his own presidential chances . So , too , in a lesser way , was his defeat for Senate whip . <P> Says Kennedy : " You take life in short bursts . Right now I look forward to the next few years in the Senate . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincidence , that work is tailored to make Kennedy look like a candidate . Without his demanding whip 's duties , he says . " I will be able to get around the country more . " He is pushing a national health insurance program broader than the President 's ; he plans further attacks on the Administration 's war policies , demanding a fixed date for U.S. withdrawal . His many other concerns-help for American Indians and Alaskan natives , aid to the aged , equal employment opportunities-combined with the continuing potential of the Kennedy mystique , will do little to end speculation . " Let 's face it , " says one of President Nixon 's political intimates . " If Muskie stumbles , the Democrats are n't going to turn to McGovern or Hughes or Bayh or Jackson . "
