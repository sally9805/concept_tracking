ARTURO Ul <P> by BERTOLT BRECHT <P> Bertolt Brecht had a stubborn faith that the task of drama was to prevent history from repeating itself . In the theater , he often seems like a classroom disciplinarian who is chalking out cautionary lessons on a blackboard . <P> The lesson of the drama that has been revived at Boston 's Charles Playhouse is best conveyed by its full title , The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui . Ui is Hitler . He and Goebbels , Goring and Roehm , under various aliases , are presented as Chicago gangsters who muscle into the vegetable trust ( the Depression-ravaged German industrialists ) and bulldoze the honest but senile leading citizen ( Hindenburg ) into legalizing their protection racket . <P> The play is a plum for the actor who plays Ui . Al Pacino would be a hand-in-glove fit for the part . Not so . Physically , he slopes about the stage in a Neanderthal manner and adopts a metronomic , tongue-darting tic . He is good at evoking the image of a sometimes sniveling , sometimes snarling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must resemble a sinister Chap lin . He must possess a chilling , demonic mesmerism . Pacino displays neither . <P> The rest of the cast is uneven . John Cazale does well as a funereally unctuous Goebbels , while Jaime Sanchez simply rants as Goring . The most dis concerting performance is that of Sully Boyar , who plays Hindenburg as a gemtlicher grandpapa with a Jewish inflection . The ultimate failure rests with Pacino , who leaves a final impression of Hitler as a poor immigrant boy who made it very very big .
