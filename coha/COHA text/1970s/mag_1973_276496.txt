" Children who were robbed of the magic of their childhood by a man-made disaster are now approaching the highly sensitive and emotional years of adolescence without arms , without legs and , in some cases , without organs . " <P> So cried British Labor M.P . Jack Ashley last month during a House of Commons debate on a subject that has roused his countrymen as few issues have done in recent years : compensation for some 400 children who were born deformed after their mothers took the tranquilizer thalidomide between 1958 and 1961 . Belatedly awakened to the financial as well as the physical plight of the children , Britons have responded with a torrent of outrage directed at the former distributor of the drug , giant Distillers Co . Ltd . More important , perhaps , the outcry appears to have forced a widespread public examination of the outdated laws and traditions that allowed what the Sunday Times called a " national shame " to go so long unnoticed and unredressed . <P> The law has generally favored the stronger of two unevenly matched sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ; besides the emotional burden they carry , some have had to pay for specialist treatment and equipment , such as electric wheelchairs and home elevators , not provided by Britain 's national health . On the other side was Distillers , one of Britain 's largest and most profitable businesses , with assets of nearly $1 billion . Distillers makes most of the world 's top-selling brands of whisky and gin and owns a host of subsidiaries . At one time these included the pharmaceutical company-since sold-that marketed thalidomide under the name of Distaval until the drug was withdrawn from the market in 1961 . <P> Ever since , Distillers has vigorously denied any legal responsibility . Since no proof of negligence has ever been established and since there was at the time no law in Britain holding a company responsible for the safety of its products , the law was on its side . Distillers , however , did tacitly admit some moral responsibility . The company offered to pay an average $36,000 per child on condition that the suits were withdrawn and the offer accepted as final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thalidomide children a lump sum of $7,000,000 . <P> Far Short . Four parents refused , including David Mason , a wealthy London art dealer , who objected to plans to put the money into a charitable trust , which could mean that it would be distributed according to need . Mason held out for three long years in the face of legal harassment and pressures from other parents who blamed him for holding up the cash . <P> Last spring Distillers raised its offer by $ 1,000,000-on condition that all parents accept the amount as a final settlement ( even though it fell far short of one actuarial estimate of the real damages , calculated at $240,000 per child ) . * In August , Distillers dropped the condition , but Mason and a handful of other parents still held out .
