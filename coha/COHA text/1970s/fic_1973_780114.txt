 | squeezing the baseball , though the reason seemed pretty remote . " Who fired ? Was there a fight ? " " Hell , no , no fight . It was a picnic . " " Yeah , a picnic . " The sheriff sat a little more forward , as if the movement might bring some order into Lancaster 's report . " Who did it ? " " Would I be here if we knew ? Would n't I be helpin ' with a rope ? It was a shot out of the dark , and that 's where you come in , to find out . That 's what taxes are for . Loose 's taxes , I happened to know , were delinquent , what little they were . " Is Buster Hogue dead ? " " As good as . What do you expect with a bullet in your bean ? " " Where is he now ? " " Loaded on a truck and comin ' in slow . The boys rigged a litter for him . Got to go easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feelin ' nothin ' . " " All right . Now let 's start from the first . " " Chick , you ai n't listenin ' . I done told you . All this palaver , and you might be corralin ' that bushwhacker . " Loose flung a wave toward me . " And here 's that pitcher of yours just feelin ' a ball . " " Just tell me . All of it . " " It was a good night for it , for the picnic , I mean . Moonlight as all hell . We even shot at a mark , some of us , and done fine . That 's how bright . Maybe forty or so of us there , countin ' famblies and guests . A bottle or two had went ' round , like they do . After we had target prac- ticed and drunk and et , we set around the fire . There was some singin ' . Buster , I happened to take note , had took off his hat . " " You would n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shot was fired ? " " Some was roamin ' around , I guess . Do n't ask me who . And some probably had to go off in the bushes , after drinkin ' and stuffin ' theirselves . " " No one saw the shot , I take it . No one saw the sniper , even in the moonlight ? " " Not so 's you 'd notice . Might have been up on a ridge , or behind a bush or jack pine or all three . It was plumb lucky ? or likely it wo n't do no final good ? that Doctor Ulysses Pierpont was there . " " He 's that psychiatrist ? " " I guess so . Head doctor , they say , and Buster was shot in the head . He wrapped up Buster 's skull and said it looked serious , the doctor did . " " " He coming along to town ? " " No . He said he 'd done all he could , which was plenty good , way I saw it . He sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to help Buster . " " Who ? " " Hawthorne , that 's his name . Professor Hawthorne . Kind of a newcomer . But , Christ sake , shake a leg , Chick ! " " We 'll wait for the truck , " Charleston said . " Wait ! " Loose 's tone had gone shrill . " Wait . " " The sheriff 's one word , spoken as it was , snubbed Loose up , like a fretful horse to a post . " But I 'll alert Old Doc Yak . " Old Doc Yak was n't the right name of the town 's only  | doctor . Old-timers , remembering a past-and-gone cartoon character , had nicknamed him that , and the nickname had buried the real one . I could n't see that that aged and rickety pill-prescriber could help much . He was n't a surgeon : he was a homeopath , which itself is something apart from the common-run healers . While the sheriff called and as we waited , I had time to think about Buster Hogue . Years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with just about one cow and one acre of land . By one means or another ? hard work he always said , not without truth ? he had built that first stake to maybe fifteen thousand acres , not counting leased land , and a herd of cattle too big for more than loose estimate . And he still was expanding , or had been . He was land-hungry but a far shot from land-poor . Along the way he had picked up plots , quarter sections , sections and more , being in a preferred spot because in the later years he had the cash ready . He was grasshungry , too , which is n't quite a repetition of what 's already been said . He liked the grass of his neighbors , or liked his cattle to feed on it . And so , on occasions fitting and proper , he left their gates open and let some of his cows through . Or so it was said . And it must have been true , else no one would have heard about altercations . Hogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide ? which was no wonder much . He was a combination of good nature , apology , bluster and toughness , and he could swing weight befitting the biggest rancher in the county . People as a whole rather admired him , more maybe for the mix of his talents than for the  | size of his roll . Even the wronged ones seemed to wind up resigned if still resentful . No one , I thought , could actively hate the old , fat son of a bitch , not really hate such a character . But now , it appeared , someone had . We were waiting outside , me minus my baseball , when the truck pulled up . The sheriff directed it to Old Doc Yak 's office . There four of us took hold of the litter and steered it inside . Buster Hogue was n't dead yet : dead men did n't snore . After we had lifted the litter to a table , Doc Yak shooed us out , all but the sheriff . Three men had come in with the truck ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar Oliphant . The last two were crusty old-timers who had little places up toward the canyon . The world would have said they did n't amount to much . Guy Jamison , younger by a score or so of years , was a right man , who was establishing a dude ranch and outfitters ' business four miles up in the mountains . We talked about the shooting and got nowhere beyond the bald fact of it . The sheriff came out and announced after he had spotted me , " He 's got a chance . The doctor says the bullet did n't break through the bone but fractured it plenty . We have to get him to the city . Jason " ? that was me ? " lacking an ambulance , I 've begged the hearse off Felix Underwood . He does n't want to drive that sixty miles to the hospital . Go get it , please . " He looked around . " You , Terry , there . How about going with him ? " Terry Stephens said , " Sure thing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was seventeen . So I fetched the hearse , and we gentled Buster Hogue  | in . Just as we were about to wheel off , Old Doc Yak scrambled out of his office and climbed into the corpse section alongside Buster , aiming if he could , I guessed , to see that the hearse did n't fulfill its true function during the trip . That was a thing you could say for the doe : he lived and died with his patients . As we pulled away , the sheriff was beckoning to the other men to come with him . It was a long drag to the city , but Terry and I did n't say much , both of us feeling ghostly , I supposed , in a machine that had taken so many men to the graveyard . There seemed to be the smell of old roses and wilting carnations in it and the vapors , the dust , of dreams come to an end . Or the faint , lingering spirits of ancient codgers and grandmas whose dreams died ahead of the flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full blush a full moon seems to spin like a fixed top . This one , just over the mountains , had lost its whirl and was ready to topple . Its long , last rays , ahead and to the side of our headlights , made crazy , light-and-dark strangers of the humps and hollows and buttes and small groves that both of us knew . Shortened and elongated , cast out of shape , weird , they kept us company and shut up our mouths . A couple of men in white helped us unload Buster at the hospital 's emergency entrance . By his long , hoarse but regular breathing , you could tell he was quite a ways from dead yet . Doc Yak went inside for a while , came out and climbed in with us , and we set out for home .  | I WAS N'T A DEPUTY SHERIFF that summer when Buster Hogue got his skull cracked , or ever afterward for that matter . I was too young for a badge . What I was was a flunky , though the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few harmless papers , sat at the phone on occasion and ran errands , of which driving that old hearse with its unconscious cargo was the most important to date . Old Jimmy Conner , who was deputized but served mostly as jailer , would n't have agreed with me as to what was of first importance . I saved his bum feet by trotting to the Commercial Cafe and bringing back grub for whatever guests he happened to be entertaining at the moment . The sheriff had two other deputies . One of them was assigned to the other end of the county , where a brash oil-field settlement had sprung up . The remaining member of the resident staff was Halvor Amussen . Halvor was an oversized Norwegian or Swede or Dane and , in any case , all tomcat . He and old Jimmy had a way of switching around on day and night shifts so you never could be sure which one at which time would be on duty . No matter . One of them always was .  | Besides being convenient for Halvor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical nurse and hence a hit-and-miss homebody . Sometimes , for want of some place to go , Jimmy would hang around the office long after his shift . The circumstances , his and his wife 's , seemed to make for a good marital relationship . The county force was big enough , given my help , of course . Our town numbered only about 15oo souls and the county maybe 3500 or 4000 at the most . Though I was n't a deputy , I could still count myself a member of the crew , and every week Charleston paid me three to five dollars , depending . I thought the money came from the county . It did n't . The job gave me pride . To be seen with Chick Charleston , who was Mister or Sheriff to me , gave me more . He looked like justice or law or clean order , and all of them tallied up . Habitually he wore polished boots and white , fitted shirts , often with a string tie , and a sand-colored stockman 's hat and frontier jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a holstered six-gun , which he seldom strapped on . But he moved with a smooth , thoughtful assurance , with an easy grace , natural to him , that in itself spoke authority . Chick Charleston had drifted into town when I was in grade school and , for one reason or another , had stayed put , coasting along on an income or savings that people speculated about . He was n't above being a good extra hand , though , when it came to branding or trailing cattle to and from summer range . His right name was Charles Charleston . " I guess , " he explained to me once , smiling  | his open smile , " the old folks were so stuck on the sound of Charleston that they wanted to repeat it , even bobtailed . " His old folks , rumor had it , were among the descendants of the English and Scottish dudes who had staked out their cattle kingdoms in Wyoming and gone belly up in the mortal winter of 1886-87 . Maybe so . He could talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small western town , but he could also talk the language of a culture beyond most of us . A strange gink , the town thought before it got used to him and accepted him as part of its pattern along with the judge and the banker , the wet-pants half-wit , who swamped the Bar Star Saloon , and old Mrs. Jenkins , who yelled hymns while ankling to and from the post office where she never got any mail . Then , provoked beyond endurance one night , he thrashed Ben Day , an ex-con and born brawler and also owner of a run-down ranch , who had whipped every other man he could get to stand up to him . So Charleston 's admirers put him up for sheriff , an office he did n't much want , and put him back in the courthouse four years later without opposition . If I did n't know where my pay came from , I did know for sure that I was where I was because once I was a juvenile delinquent . Some four years before , a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm up after being caught in a blizzard while hunting ducks . Kindling and paper being right at hand , we built a fire in the old Cole 's Hot  | Blast stove . Then , comfortable , we roamed the big house and happened on to pillows and began chasing and beating each other with them . The pillows were stuffed with feathers . At first , I mean . We tossed away the slack covers , found some soap and drew pictures on mirrors . My contribution to art was a naked man at the ready . My friend did even better . And yet there was a kind of innocence in all we did . We did n't set out to do damage . We did n't aim to show off , or chagrin or embarrass anybody . We did n't give one thought to other people . It was as if the house , vacated , never again would be seen by human eyes . I doubt we even went that far in our thinking , if any . We were there , the house was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know it then , that my friend lost his bandanna during our frolic . It happened that a member of the family that owned the house found it . It happened that my friend 's old man owned and operated the only laundry in town . From owner to sheriff to laundryman ? and then our inning in court . We were summoned from class , my friend and I , and led by our fathers to the office of old Judge LePage , who was only a justice of the peace but solemn enough for any and all jurisdictions . Ours was a silent and sorry walk , with guilt riding us and our fathers marching on either side , but sorrier yet was the time to come . There were maybe a dozen men in the judge 's little hearing room , all looking as if they never had strayed from the paths of righteousness since being signed up for the Sunday school cradle roll . They were stiff as set slabs  | of lutefisk , which is a dried fish that has to be soaked and lyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All were like that but the sheriff , that is , the enemy who had exposed us . He sat in the front row , 175 pounds of law enforcement carefully dressed , and his face wore the look neither of censure nor triumph . I did n't know what to make of that look . Thoughtful ? Impersonal ? Coolly resigned to the fool ways of boys ? Judge LePage called the hearing to order . The family representative told of the condition he had found the house in . The handkerchief was introduced and identified by my friend 's father . Except for our expressions , which must have been giveaways , there was the only real evidence against us ? the bandanna and its laundry mark ? but we were n't by nature liars and , our throats choked , fessed up with little nods to the big questions . The case was dismissed with a lecture , a light sentence you might call it unless you 'd been there . Judge LePage 's words would have blistered asbestos . The men filed out , offish and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and singles started on their separate ways . I edged out alone , not wanting company , even that of my friend , and took a cross street and looked away yonder to the high hills which appeared cold but neutral . I knew I 'd get more hell when I got home , cold but not neutral . It was then I felt a hand on my shoulder . A voice said , " It 's all over , Jase . " A turn of my head , and I saw the friendly , little-smiling face of Chick Charleston , the sheriff  | who had found us out . His soft voice went on , " I know , Jase . It 's almightly hard to be a kid . " So there was the beginning of friendship and trust . There was the beginning of my hanging around him and his office . And there was the reason for the white-chip position I occupied . In the years right after my great disgrace , I grew up fairly tall , six feet plus a fraction . I had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a schoolboy pitcher and was good enough , though still in school , in time to pitch for the scrounged-up town team . As I got better I began to get paid , as much as ten dollars for some games . That money , plus sheriff's-office cash , was enough for me . Why bale hay or build fence or nurse stock in those long summer days ? Besides , I would be in the big leagues before long . All I needed was better control . Which was why I squeezed a baseball ? to strengthen my hand . I never made the big time . I never tried to . I went to college instead and had a go , not brilliant , at creative writing . My teacher , a shriveled professor , complained I was prone to lapse into the lingo of the country in which I grew up . No , the big leagues were n't for me . Though my right hand knit well enough , it still was n't good enough , not after I broke it trying to save the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jase ? " the sheriff asked me . It was morning of the same day I had returned from my joy ride in the old hearse . I had got out of bed early , choosing to miss sleep rather than goings-on , and had had breakfast and come right to the office . There had been few people about , and none knew enough to be curious yet . " Nothing much , " I answered . " I own a twenty-two pump and a shotgun , half-choke , both of them Winchesters . " " Charleston was fingering a couple of cartridges , one for a revolver , I guessed , and one for a rifle , their calibers not plain to me . " Buster Hogue 's still alive , but that 's all , " he said . " Never a chirp from the poor bird . " He studied the cartridges in his hand and added , " Funny . " I waited for him to explain , but he did n't speak for a while . He just sat there , half out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shells he held to the shiny toe of one boot , as if a clue might be scuffed on it . Then he said , getting up , " Damn court would be in  | session today and need me as a witness in a pisswillie case . Ought to be through at noon . You want to take a ride with me at , say , about one o'clock ? " I told him I did but , before he could go , Old Doc Yak came galloping in , satchel in hand , to treat a prisoner whose hangover woes could be heard now and then in the office . The man , taken drunk at a country bar , had shot at a friend , missed , and punctured a slop pail . Charleston waited for Doc to return from the cells in back . " Paraldehyde , " Doc said as he came out . " That 'll gentle the snakes . " " Hold it , Doc , " Charleston said . " For what ? " " Buster Hogue . " " You know all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How well was it treated ? " " Best of my ability . " " Sure . Sure . I mean before . By that Doctor Pierpont ? " " Adequate . " " " No more than that ? " " What the hell ? Adequate is adequate . " " And professional courtesy is professional courtesy ? " " Goddam it , Chick , he 's a psychiatrist . " Doc Yak snorted . " Mental healing for loose bowels . Anyhow , he 's not accustomed to country sawbones work . Not his field . And what 's the big idea , my friend ? " " Nothing , I guess . " " And I guess you 're right . " Doc grunted and thumped out . I left the office then and looked up Terry Stephens , who had been laid off from unloading a couple of freight cars  | because the cars were unloaded . As a catcher he was n't good enough for the team , but he was always willing to catch my practice pitches . On our way to the vacant lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence for a backstop , we kept stopping to tell the curious the Buster Hogue score , or as much of it as we knew . And we held up long enough to watch and hear old Mrs. Jenkins , who was yelling out , " Let the lower lights be burning . . . , " while enroute to the post office . I figured her lights were burning pretty low . I practiced and fooled around with Terry for a couple of hours , went home and studied my book on fingerprinting and had lunch with my mother and dad and told about last night 's shooting . My dad , an abstracter , said with a semi-serious smile , " Chick and you will uncover the culprit . Chick alone if duty calls you elsewhere , " meaning to the pitcher 's mound . He did n't oppose my baseball ambition . He just treated it lightly . The sheriff was waiting for me . He told old Jimmy to man the office and led out to his car , which was his own ( not the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for operation and maintenance . It was a modified machine with plenty of clearance , unlike the factory jobs that high-centered on horse turds and cost punctured gas tanks and lost mufflers on country roads . It had extra-ply tires , a hand choke for cold-weather starting and power enough for the law 's purposes . He called it his Rocky Mountain Special . " Where to , Jase ? " he asked , as if he had n't already made up his mind . " To the scene of the crime , I s'pose. "  | " We 'll dude it first . " He meant we 'd go see Guy Jamison , the dude rancher . It was an agreeable enough drive . For seven miles we followed the new highway that was n't quite super but was called that . It carried a lot of traffic ? summer tourists , logging trucks and assorted vans bound to and from Canada . Then we turned off onto what Loose had called that rocky-asked road . Bouncing around , seeing high summer on all sides and the blued mountains lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in this , my own climate and country , good to be with Charleston , good to know I was pitching come Sunday . I had brought the baseball along and gave it a squeeze or two when I remembered . We found Guy Jamison in his toolshed working on packhorse rigging , I imagined in preparation for the biggame season . He laid aside the rigging and put down a ball-peen hammer as we pulled up and got out . He was lean and muscular , as a man had to be to heave and hitch packs on a pack string , and his eyes had the squint of the guide in them , the mountain squint that could see elk and bear where dudes could n't . His smile made his face different from common sober . " Time to talk awhile , Guy ? " Charleston asked . " Sure thing . Dudes are out riding , or fishing . Come on up to the house . " The house was his new lodge . We called out hello to his wife , who along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inside , we took seats in the lodge room , and Guy offered beer , which I refused , the higher law being present , and Charleston accepted .  | " Some place you 've got , " the sheriff said , looking around , after Guy had come back with the bottles . It was some place , as clean and joined and close-built as a cabinetmaker could ask . " Thanks , " Guy said like a man who could n't take compliments easily . " If it ever pays off . " He took a sip of beer . " What 's the word on Buster Hogue ? " " Still alive but still out . Guy , were you on hand all during the picnic ? " " Mostly . I did n't have time to sneak off and shoot . " Guy 's smile transformed his face again . " I mean , did you note anything , like absences from the group , that might be significant ? Who was present around the fire , and who was n't , when Buster got hit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had my dudes there and rode herd on them when I was n't passing them grub from the chuck wagon I 'd brought along as a sort of special attraction , as an extra treat , you might say . " " Quite a treat . " " Yeah . I thought maybe they 'd jump the reservation , some of them , after the shooting , but , Jesus Christ , no ! They 've seen the wild west , just like in pictures , and ca n't be pried off the place until their set time runs out . " " Did you talk to Hogue at all ? " " For maybe one minute . He was riding his conservative horse , bitching about high taxes , government spending , government waste , humbuggery at all levels . " " Did you happen to see whether Hogue took off his hat ? " " What the hell ? Oh , sure . Pretty bald . Pretty target . No . I did n't notice . "  | " Loose Lancaster said he did . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it ? But Lancaster ? That 's loco , Chick . " " I suppose , but it 's an interesting if unlikely item . Who notices when a man uncovers ? Or who remembers without special reason ? " Guy got up to fetch more beer . The sheriff scuffed his chin with his knuckles , gave me a little grin and asked , " Any questions ? " I did n't have any , but I noticed that Charleston took off his hat on entering the room and so had a bit of evidence to offset his observations . " All right , then , " the sheriff said after Guy had returned with fresh bottles . " You did n't see anything that would stir up suspicion . You say Loose Lancaster is out . And now tell me , Guy , just who has had trouble with Hogue . All of them that you know . " Guy smiled that surprising smile and answered , " Who has n't ? " He fingered out a cigarette and lit it with a kitchen match . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You might . A motive you 're after . Well , Hogue wo n't keep up his fences . He leaves my gates down . I 've got just enough graze for my own horses , none to feed his damn cattle . We 've had a run-in or two . Make it four at the least . " " So ? " " Make no mistake . I 've got a temper . When I was greener , before I wised up , I told our friend Hogue I was dickering for a quarter section of land I needed for pas- ture . Next thing 1 knew , Hogue had bought it out from under me . When I braced him , he just smiled and said , Business is business . ' We had it hot and heavy . I could have killed him . " For an instant Guy 's face set itself in old rage . Then it relaxed . " A thing with me , " he went on , " is I ca n't remain mad . Call it a weakness , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat your guts out . You have no time but for anger , none for the business at hand . " " Right , " Charleston said , nodding . " And in spite of all , believe it or not , I kind of like the old bastard . You can grade him blow-hard and loud-fart , sort of amusing itself , and he sure God has been greedy for land , but , if he 'd diddle you one way or another and let his cows in on your grass , in time of real need he 'd give you , well , not the shirt off his back , but his old one . Yep . More or less likable . " Charleston was turning his sand-colored hat in his hands . " We can cross off your dudes as witnesses , I would think . They would n't have seen anything . " " Except scenery , and it through bifocals or camera finders . Good bunch but city-bred blind . " " Then name me who 's had trouble with Hogue . " Guy gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing or two without asking and then answered , " Ben Day 's number one . " " Outside of him , for the time being . " " I would say all whose land butts on his . Offhand , Oscar Oliphant , Blue Piatt , Loose Lancaster , Plenty Toogood , Taller-Ass McNair. "  | We were strong on nicknames , I better explain . Blue Piatt 's initials were B. L. U. , standing for what nobody knew . Plenty Toogood 's first name was Robert but never used unless on a mortgage or check . Taller-Ass McNair was a real old old-timer who in days before mine kept his saddle anointed with mutton tallow , which put a brand on his britches . " I 've already talked to Loose , Oliphant and Piatt , " the sheriff said . " No good as witnesses . As suspects ? " He shrugged . " Well . " For a long minute there was silence . Then he asked , " What about your hermit ? " " Chouquette . " Guy gave it the local pronunciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , unless hiding out with a rifle . Once he butchered one of Hogue 's steers , as a warning against trespass , I guess . Nothing much came of that except hot words and winter meat for Pierre . " " There 's that newcomer , Professor Powell Hawthorne , is n't it ? Does n't his land abut Hogue 's ? Have you met him ? " " Yes to all questions . Met him and his daughter both ? God , what a filly ? last night at the picnic and just once before . The place ? it 's a full section , you know , with a nice cabin on it ? was left to him by his brother . You remember old Spike Hawthorne ? Gone most of the time , wintering in Phoenix , and died and was buried there six , eight months ago . " " I knew him to speak to . " " Buster tried to get hold of that section , I hear . The professor said no . He 's a retired geologist , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying rocks and the birds and the bees . I would call him an old-fashioned gentleman , ivy brand . " Guy paused and then threw in , " He 's quite a historian and collector , too . Got a nice lot of old guns . " " Old guns ! " " Sharps , Henrys , Colts and more . But hold up , Chick . I doubt he ever fired one . Trouble with Hogue ? Not to my knowledge . It 's your guess whether he saw anything at the picnic . " Charleston finished his beer and said no to another . I remembered I had n't squeezed the baseball in some time and so began squeezing it . " So we come to the doctor , " the sheriff said . " Ulysses Pierpont . How 's that for a monicker ? Goes nice with psychiatrist . You met him ? " " Not even seen him . " " He 's new this summer and comes up from the city just when his practice allows . He picked up a few acres , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed at the time . Got a small trailer house on it but big plans for the future . That 's the word , anyhow . Me , I saw him for the first time last night . " " To talk to ? " " Not much . A little , after Buster was shot . I just thanked the Lord he was there . He knew his business . " " So Doc Yak told me . But for him , he said , Buster would have died on the way in to town . " " Yeah . Pierpont did n't say so , but I guess he thought the case was hopeless regardless . I know he looked grave  | and was shaking his head when we carried Hogue off . " " No bad blood between them ? " " Nuts , Chick . " " And no prior contact ? " " None I could swear to . I did hear , true or false , that Doctor Pierpont wanted to buy a quarter section from Hogue to add to his patch , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No soap either time . That do n't make a case for you , for God 's sake . " Charleston ran a hand over his head , started to say something and did n't , and asked after a while , " What about threats to Hogue , from the men mentioned al-ready ? " " For what they 're worth . Blue Piatt said he 'd kill Hogue if he did n't keep his cows inside his own fences . That 's for sure . I heard it . One of Hogue 's boys , little Buster , it was , said in my presence that Oscar Oliphant had shoved him and a bunch of strayed beef off his place with a rifle . Loose Lancaster runs off at the mouth , and so what ? Pierre Chouquette , well , he did butcher a steer , but , besides that , who knows what goes on in the mind of that Indian hermit ? You can forget old McNair . He 's a friend and more or less a retainer of Hogue 's . " Guy lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he breathed out . " Why dodge Ben Day ? " The sheriff smiled a thinking smile , which uncovered teeth a girl would have prized , her jaws allowing . It was when he smiled that you realized how clear blue his eyes were . There was good nature in his face , good nature  | mixed with fixed purpose ; and it struck me as I looked at him that I would n't want to be the man he was after but , having been caught , would be glad he was the man who had caught me . " I know , " he said . " Any fool would point first to Day . " " Why not ? He had the biggest trouble with Buster . " " So I 've heard . But that was smoothed over , you know , and never got to my office . What 's your version ? " " Hearsay , same as yours . Day had a Forest Service permit and damn few cows to trail up to mountain pasture . His count was about two hundred short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he made a deal with Buster by which Buster would use that summer graze . " Charleston shrugged and said just as a side remark , " And to hell with regulations . " " Sure . Neither one cared about government rules . But to play safe from nosy rangers , they changed the brands on those cattle , from Buster 's to Day 's . About then Day had a bright idea , or maybe he had had it before . On the strength of the brand he mortgaged the cattle . " As if to a story heard before , the sheriff nodded . " And got found out . " " Somehow . I do n't know the straight of it . Seems Buster got his cattle back and the bank ? the Second State in the city , I heard ? the bank recovered its loan , and that was that . Never a charge made . " " Because Buster could n't come into court with clean hands . " " And banks do n't like stinks , long as the cash drawer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , " Charleston said , and blew out a deep breath . " No little birds telling me how Buster and Day feel now , one toward the other . " There was a question in his words , and Guy answered , " Me , neither . But it stands to reason they 're not what you would call bosom pals . Not Mr. Ben Day , anyhow . " The sheriff got up and said , " All right , Guy . Thanks . Come on , Jase . " As we stood there about to go , Mrs. Jamison and the cabin girl came in , looking a little flushed from the sun . We said a few things back and forth , but what I noticed was the eye that cute cabin girl had for the sheriff . Good God , she was too young and fresh for him . He must have been forty and a long ways from fresh . While we were on the way to the car , Guy called out , " How 's the old wing , Jase ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversation . " Felt good this morning , " I called back , waving the baseball , and Charleston and I climbed into the Rocky Mountain Special . Once we were on the way , Charleston said , " Now we 'll dodge in on the picnic grounds . " We pulled up on the ridge overlooking the bottom . The ridge had a few stunted pines on it and some creeping juniper and , in the gravel and dry grass , a crisscross of tire tracks left by the cars that had parked there . The bottom was a sweet place , open except for the willows flanking the river , which here made a bend and had gouged out a trout hole as deep and blue as a fisherman 's dream . At the east end of the little flat stood Jamison 's canvas-clad chuck wagon , which could have been gotten  | down the steep , bouldered slope only by Jamison 's highwheeled , four-wheel-drive truck . In the center was the dead picnic fire . From above , it was the only sign of last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sawn for seats . Even with a shooting to draw top attention , someone or more had remembered to pick up the trash . We scrambled down the ridge and went to the remains of the fire . One of the blocks had been overturned and lay on its side . Studying it and the ground close around , Charleston pointed to a small patch of gravel and grass , stained and coated with what I knew was n't rust . He began taking sightings , moving a little this way and that while his eyes reconnoitered the ridge . He was n't saying anything , though , and I wandered off to the trout hole . And almost the first thing I saw was a native trout like none seen before . Deep through the rippled water it shimmered , dark-backed , silver-sided , the five or six pounds of it holding upstream against the current with the barest pulse of its tail . Even before Charleston called , I knew I would have to come back with a fly rod , and I slid away so as not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Charleston moved from one place to another , his eyes on the ground . I did n't know what he looked for until he said , " Jase , it 's damn unlikely it was any kind of automatic , which would eject the casing itself , but is n't it likely that a man used to guns would work the lever or pump without thinking ? Unless , of course , he 'd thought about that . " We scuffed through the grass and examined the gravel without results , and then got back in the car .  | " Now , " the sheriff told me when we were rolling again , " we 'll drop in to pass the time of day with Mr. Ben Day . " I spoke the thought that came to me . " Mr. Charleston , excuse me , but ought n't you to be armed ? " He turned long enough to grin at me and answer , " My cause is just . " I was n't wise enough then to hook up his words to the quotation . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six miles farther down . The sky was deep and blue any way you looked , and the wind as quiet as the sun in the grass . It would have been a good day for baseball , and it was hard to think that anyone hereabouts , on this summerkissed afternoon , could have taken a pot shot at Buster . Day 's place was just a so-so ranch with plenty of acreage but most of it stony and pretty bald . In sight after we turned into the half-mile dirt lane came the sprawl of house and weather-battered outbuildings and quite a lot of machinery , some of it broken and discarded and the remainder neglected , all standing or lying in faded red and green colors . A couple of orphaned lambs ? we called them bums ? bawled for handouts at the back door , though they were big enough to rustle for themselves . A gopher flirted his tail at the edge of a scattered woodpile . We had no more than pulled up than Day opened the back door and came out . We left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , in the lead . " Hello , " Charleston said . " Nice afternoon . " Day looked friendly . He always looked friendly . He had a toothpick in his mouth and tongued it to one side so 's to answer . " Howdy , Sheriff . Always glad to see you . "  | You would n't think a man could make a toothpick insulting , not with a grin to go along with it . " Good , " Charleston said . " You know why I 'm here . " " Let me take a guess . You would n't be hawkshawin ' around ? " " Just asking questions . " " And Ben Day , he 's your man . Sorry , Sheriff , I do n't know a damn thing , except the radio just said old Hogue was still hangin ' on . " " Yeah . I 'm trying to locate any party or parties that saw anything at the picnic . " " Wrong number . " " Or did anything ? " " Guilty , Your Honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do at a picnic . " While the sheriff sized him up , he stood slouching easy in his work clothes ? denim shirt , denim pants hitched low and corral-stained , western hat cocky-cocked on his head . Wind and fists had coarsened his face . His nose slanted off from an old break . " Cut it out ! " The sheriff 's voice had an edge to it now . " You did n't see anything or do anything , so you say . Were you with the bunch all the time ? " " I be goddamned . " Day 's tone was still soft . " Does a man have to have a permit to piss ? Maybe I did piss , goin ' off by myself on account , you know , of ladies bein ' present . Maybe I climbed the hill to my pickup for a bottle or more cigarettes . Maybe . " " Maybe you did . Maybe you saw , time of the shot , whether Buster had his hat on or off ? " " No help . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The sheriff turned away . I was thinking of more questions to ask , though I did n't suppose they would have got answers , not from that mocking and insolent and confident ex-con . Before we reached the car , Day called , " You 're welcome . Just let me know if I can help . " " We were near town before Charleston spoke again , and then all he said was , " One thing I would bet on . He climbed the ridge . "  | BUSTER HOGUE 'S CONDITION remained the same the next day , which was Saturday . The hospital had him marked down as critical , no visitors , and a neurosurgeon had been called in on the case . That 's what the sheriff told me when I showed up bright and early . He was drinking a cup of coffee , the sheriff was , and old Jimmy was hovering around as if he thought Charleston should spring into action like a goosed frog . Jimmy was a good lockup man and got along fine with the prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself before age cut down on the current . Now and then he had a beer , saying he had drunk enough of the hard stuff to give the D.T. 's to all the hard cases on record . These were about the sum of his qualities , though . As a detective he rated somewhere around minus one . Charleston was n't springing , not yet . For all I could tell he was just fooling around in his head , his face relaxed and his eyes exploring his thoughts . He did say , " Saturday . Nobody home likely , unless old McNair or Chouquette. "  | I asked , " Anything for me ? " " Maybe later . " So I excused myself and walked down to old Mrs. Jenkins ' house . It was a white , rambling picket-fenced place with a chicken run in the rear , all left to her by her late husband , who had died to the time of " Bringing in the Sheaves , " though he did n't hear it , having gone conveniently deaf some time before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you had to allow for embroidery . Once and sometimes twice a week Mrs. Jenkins wanted me to chop the head off a fryer so 's to have meat in the skillet and no blood on her hands . Also to make sure she did n't cut off a finger while performing the execution herself . She gave me good-morning after I had knocked on the door and said yes to the butchering and sailed back in the house , resting her vocal chords , I guessed , for the parade to the post office . I caught and decapitated the chicken , collected the customary two bits and went away to the hummed blessing of " Work for the Night Is Coming . " Even with the almost-super highway skirting the town , the place was busy , not yet having accepted the idea that Saturday and Sunday were one in the realm of nongainful endeavor . It was Mabel Main 's day off , though , and she came coursing down Main Street with the high-kneed gait of a harness horse . She was all bone and fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever known , which was why she had survived automation . When the  | company proposed to replace her with dials and wrong numbers , the subscribers threatened to cancel out and establish a co-op . So Mabel stayed on , being charged up to good will , it would seem . She knew everything . If Mrs. Smith gave her Mrs. Jones ' number , she would say , that being the case , " This is Mrs. Jones ' day to play bridge at Mrs. Sandusky 's . Want me to ring her there ? " The telephone office provided a good lookout , too . So Mabel knew when Frank Featherston was visiting Mrs. Younce , the widow , because she could see Frank 's old faithful setter waiting on Mrs. Younce 's porch for Frank to finish his business . That last bit is one of the truths or parttruths that a young fellow picks up , barely believing . Mabel said to me , " Howdy , Deputy , you fireballer . How 's the sleuth ? " " Sleuthing . " " And the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of day , huh ? " There was a look on her face that seemed to say more than the words . Did she have something to tell him , something she 'd listened in on ? Or was it that she just hankered to see him , being more than a bit smitten , as people said ? Eeeny , meeny . I could see her going for him but not him for her , though at forty or thereabouts he could n't hope for the pick of the field . Miny , mo . " Leave it to him , " I told her . She let out a humph and left me , striding knees high . Buster Junior was leaning against the front of the Bar Star Saloon . He was , a muscular , mouthy and ill-tempered son of a bitch , and why he and Ben Day had n't  | tangled I did n't know . One of those accidents of time and opportunity , probably . Or brother peas in a pod . I asked about his father . What he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doin ' ? Ironin ' a crease in his britches on account of he sits down so much ? Tell him to get off his ass . " I doubted that I could whip him , but still I could feel my pitching arm tense . And it worked against me that he was older by several years ? which made a big psychological difference at age seventeen . " You tell him , " I said , " but I would n't advise it . " He was mouthing something as I turned and walked off . Otto Dacey was coming up the street with his blank look and damp pants . He was the swamper , meaning sweeper , that I 've told about , and was n't allowed in the bar until closing time , which usually meant that the saloon closed on time . You could n't get upwind from him there . He stopped and shook his head sadly and said as I maneuvered away from his scent , " That poor Mrs. Jenkins . " " Yeah , Otto , but she gets along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People crazy . So many . " I savvied his reference . Once he had been sent to the asylum ? Central State Hospital we called it , being nice about stigma ? and after a few months had been certified sane and released . It was his pride , his mark of superiority , that he was the one man in the county whose sanity had been tried , tested and proven . Sometimes I thought he was right , though he still peed his pants and ,  | when he happened to think about it , peed in the gutter ? which last was the reason he 'd been sent to the asylum on a count of repeated indecent exposure . I said , " We 're all crazy but you , Otto , " and walked away accompanied by his smile . It was too early for lunch , and so I went to our backyard and practiced control , using an old door on which I 'd sketched an exact home plate with some leftover paint . The strikes had a bare edge over balls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took me along on that summer 's trips unless it was that company helped him parcel his thoughts out . Or unless it was that , like any man , he liked someone to ride with and chose the first convenient free soul . Anyway , we had n't gone far that afternoon , bound for old Taller-Ass McNair 's place , when he said , " That bullet , Jase , it ricocheted off Buster Hogue 's skull . Hit it and veered up . What do you make of that ? " " Foul tip , " I said . " Oh , pisswillie . You keep shaking hands with that baseball , and pretty soon your head will be diamondshaped . If it 's not too much to ask , take your mind off your mitt and aim it at bone head and firepower . " He was smiling as he spoke , smiling that easy , disarming smile of his which suggested peace , not police , but still held the hint of purpose and force to go with it . I said , " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day 's ball game , which was against Bear Paw and was sure to be tough , that team by report having recruited three or four city ringers.  | But neither ball game nor shooting was enough to fill my mind by itself , not on a day like today with the air clear and clean as at the beginning of time , with the green-fringed , business-as-ever river to our left and the wild grasses barely saluting the breeze . It was a day for the final , elusive truth to come out of hiding . McNair 's place lay west of the Rose River ? which meant we had to follow the highway , take Loose Lancaster 's road for about twenty miles and then turn left and cross the one bridge over the stream , passing the picnic grounds on the way . Thereafter the road was little more than an old wagon trail , flanked and centered with boulders that a driver had to snake through , else lose his car 's guts on the everlasting stone . And the road that swung off of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even worse . Which was one reason why federal agents had n't closed down his still in the old Prohibition days before mine . Another was , I 'd been told , that his moonshine was almost as good as prescription whiskey , and what agent did n't like a good drink when his day 's work was done ? McNair 's house was little more than a shed . There was an old wagon beside it with one broken wheel and a beat-up Ford that might have been bought from old Henry himself . A pitcher pump stood rusty at one side of the shack and a pile of saw logs at the other . They were just about the total of exterior decoration except for a little wash bench with a bucket on it and a rag of a hand towel that drooped from a nail . A big , surly dog ran from behind the house , charged  | close and dared us to get out of the car . While I hesitated , wishing for a ball bat , the sheriff dismounted . He stooped and spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potlicker , " he said , his tone soft . The dog took a sniff and retreated a yard or two , growling but undecided . Old Man McNair appeared at the door , pulling his hat down against the sun 's glare . He waited , wordless . I got out of the car , keeping an eye on the dog . I never had been crazy about dogs , not since a neighbor 's pet bit me while I was stooped under a currant bush trying to retrieve my baseball . The sheriff said , " Howdy . Nice afternoon . " The old man had a beak that an eagle would have accepted with thanks , sharp eyes set close beside it and a mustache fertilized by tobacco . As a baby he must have been rocked to sleep while astraddle a barrel . But , for all his years and bowlegs , he looked fit enough . " Goddam heel flies , " he said to the sheriff 's greeting . He spit at a wild showy daisy , turning it into a sunflower . " Ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thought you 'd want to know Buster Hogue 's holding on . " " Thanks . " The old cuss did n't mean thanks . He meant get the hell gone . The sheriff studied him as if wondering where to use a pry bar . Then he asked suddenly , " You at the picnic ? " McNair let out , " Where else ? " and spit again . " So maybe you picked up some ideas ? " " Keep guessin ' . " " Ideas like who did it ? " " Sons of bitches . "  | " That 's for sure . Who ? " " Find out . " " I 'll do just that , " Charleston said . He added , " Given some help . " " I done sold out the last batch . Waitin ' for a new order . " The sheriff took a bandanna ? silk , it looked like ? from a pocket of his creased pants and used it on his forehead . " Hot here in the sun , " he said . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sky that had never seen a cloud and never hoped to see one . In the distance you could see the earth breathing heat waves . " Thirsty weather , " Charleston told McNair . " You got a bucket inside , I suppose . " Without waiting for yes or no , he veered around the old man and started through the open door . McNair turned to follow , saying nothing . That left me and that ugly stud dog , who had lain growling at the side of the shack and now made a sashay to get at my heels , but I pulled my arm back , baseball in hand , and so fazed him long enough for a skip through the doorway . Inside , there were a rickety stand table together with bucket and dipper , a straight chair held upright by baling wire , a wooden block to accommodate company , a bed with an old soogan on it , a sheet-metal stove with firewood beside it and an up-ended apple box decorated with a tin plate and one fork , both unwashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance . Then I saw that Charleston had stopped before a deer-antler rack nailed to the wall . The horns cradled an old rifle , and one prong served  | as a hook for a hat . McNair had curved by him and was about to plant his old butt on the bed . " Spanish-American War ? " Charleston said . I guessed his reference was to the rifle . McNair answered , " One kind . Springfield forty-five seventy . Hands off . " " Was n't about to , " Charleston told him . He moved over and took a drink from the dipper and let himself down on the block . Seeing that McNair had taken the bed now , I perched myself on the chair . " You 're Buster 's friend ? " Charleston asked . " Heel flies and sons of bitches . " The old man spit the words out . The sheriff paid no mind . " Now you take Blue Piatt or Oscar Oliphant or Pierre Chouquette or even Loose Lancaster ? they are n't what you could call Buster 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if just reviewing the prospects in his own mind . " Ask ' ern . " " Uh-huh . " Now the sheriff leaned forward , and his eyes bored at McNair . " How about Ben Day ? " " I never seen nothin ' . I do n't say nothin ' . Quit your goddam buzzin ' . " " Not yet , old-timer . You know as well as anybody that Ben and Buster had trouble , but Buster could n't push charges because he himself was outside the law . Ben held a grudge , though . I 'll lay odds . " " Damn your heel-fly soul ! You shut up about Buster ! Best man in the country , and shot down now , and you blackenin ' his good name . " The sheriff gave the old man a long , unmoving study .  | Then he said , " A friend , you call yourself , " and again fell silent . After the pause he pointed abruptly toward the horn rack , and even before he spoke I suspected it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That hat there . Seems to have a hole in it . Or holes . " From where I sat all I could see was that the hat was an old one , once probably off-white and still pretty pale . " I declare , " the old man answered , calm as could be and as insolent . " Could have been tromped on by a calkshod horse , a bronc . " " Whose hat ? " McNair pushed his own hat back on his head and to my surprise answered , " Buster Hogue 's . " " So ? " " Damn picnic fools left it , totin ' Buster away . I picked it up . That 's how come . " Charleston got up , went over and examined the hat and said , " Hm-m . " Then he put it back on the prong and turned to McNair . " Lancaster said he had taken his hat off , and so his bald head served fine as a target ? " " His name is Loose . " " Nickname . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet and went out with him . The dog growled us into the Special . We were quiet while Charleston wound the car over the bouldered trail , but when the going got easier I asked the little question that was first in my mind . " What 's this heel-fly business , Sheriff ? Heel flies , he kept saying . " " Old name , " Charleston told me . " Some time , way back , the law was after him . Heel flies , that was what  | rustlers and cowpunchers on the run called sheriffs and deputy marshals . " I could understand , having seen livestock on the bolt from the pests . " It says it , " I said . " Better than fuzz . " The sheriff turned left on the main trail , away from the town . " McNair 's set against the likes of us two . Whatever he saw and whatever he knows , he 'd play tight-mouth with the law . Guilty or not guilty , witness or no . " I made bold to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he answered , " but it was n't calks made those holes . " " I did n't press him , but it seemed to me that the hat , being pale , would have served as a target almost as well as Buster 's bald head . Almost , but not quite , which maybe was the reason that Buster still lived . But , saying the hat was the mark , what happened to Loose 's story that Buster had taken it off ? And where did it leave Loose ? Pretty soon I realized we were bound for Pierre Chouquette 's . The place lay in the scrub pine in a gulch close to the river . I knew it from fooling around while out fishing . Charleston pulled up a few yards from the cabin , which looked old-maid tidy , something you would n't expect from a hermit . Beyond it was a little barn and a store of corral poles set on their butts against the weather and sloped in to the top , tepee fashion . They were one of Chouquette 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into wide , slanting fields that rose to a butte.  | " Nobody home , " I said . " Sure ? " " The running gear to his lumber wagon is gone , and so are those two old horses of his . They 'd be in the catch pasture this time of year or in the shade of the barn . Likely he 's gone into the canyon for logs or more poles . " To make certain , Charleston gave a couple of blasts with his horn and , getting no answer , settled back in his seat . Here , beside the little cabin , we might have been alone in the world . There was a sort of free desolation about the place , as if the owner had been taken away and left as proof of his once being only the forsaken work of his hands . There came to my mind , while the silence sang around us , a couple of lines liked by my father . " They are all gone away . There is nothing more to say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I counted six plus the mother hen ? pointed up the absence of man , whom the earth had been made for but was n't his anymore . The sheriff 's voice brought me up with a bump . " lase , " he said , and got out one of the two or three thin cigars he rationed himself day by day . After he had it going , he went on , " The fix we 're in reminds me of old Chet Bayliss . " " Bayliss ? " " Down south . You would n't know him . He lived by himself , Chet did , in a cabin ? a house it was really ? ten , twelve miles from town . He had enough to get along on , having saved up his money just so , in old age , he  | could get away and not be pestered by people . Toward the human race he was like our friend , Chouquette , here . Four miles away a lawyer , name of Bill Rogers , had a summer and weekend cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " The sheriff drew deep on his cigar and breathed out the smoke slow , seeing that other time and organizing his story . " Trouble had come to Chet earlier . It was his eyes . Cataracts . But he had them operated on and could see all right , all right as long as he wore specs as thick as ice cubes . Without them he could n't be sure about daylight and dark . So he had them on his nose all the time , except when he went to bed he laid them on a little table close to his head . You savvy ? " I said I did , and the sheriff breathed out another slow puff . " We go back to Bill Rogers , the lawyer . His trouble was pack rats . You have to keep after those varmints or they 'll chew up the place and get in the house one way or another , even down a stovepipe and out through the damper , and they 'll gnaw what can be gnawed and what ca n't and leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's what I 've heard , " I said , and thought to squeeze my neglected baseball . " Bill got after them . Not with poison , for that killed off the chipmunks and squirrels , but with traps . He bought half a dozen and set them in old lengths of stovepipe , laid flat , which rats like to travel , and he placed a couple  | of them behind a wornout door put on its side and angled against the wall of his barn . " Charleston looked at his cigar and decided on a drag or two more before going on . " Came the day . Saturday and just sunup , it was , and Bill Rogers hustled from town to run his trap line . First off , he looked at the barn door . One chain was tight , so he knew he had a catch there under cover . He hunted up a stick to knock the rat in the head with . " Stick in hand , he swung back the door , and , by God , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skunk and , what 's more , ass-aimed right at him . It let fly . " Bill dropped the door back and gave himself two seconds for shock and two more for inspiration . He was that kind of a man . " The sheriff paused , for effect I supposed , but I could n't help prodding him . " Then ? " I asked . " Then , " he answered after more pause , " he walked to his car , got in and drove to Chet Bayliss ' place . He was pretty sure Chet would still be in bed , him liking to sleep late , and he hid his car behind a bunch of aspen , went to the house and let himself in , slow and quiet . He tiptoed to Chet 's bedroom . There he just stood . And stood and stood . " And all at once Chet came out of his sleep , flicked open his poor eyes , took a trial sample of the air , snorted it out and clawed for his glasses . Before he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill tiptoed out . " Abruptly , the tale told , Charleston put the cigar in his teeth , started the car and backed up for a turn-around . I was laughing .  | " Last I heard , " Charleston said after he had shifted gears , " old Chet was still talking about that goddam invisible skunk . Where it came from , how it got in and out , leaving no sign of itself except stink . Old Chet , never knowing the right of it . " We were back on the road to town now , and the sheriff concluded , " What ? Who ? Why ? Whence and wherefore ? The invisible skunk . There we are , Jase. "  | WE WERE THE VISITING TEAM , and so most of the fans were against us , but we won the ball game , 5 to 3 , and I went the route , though without much to brag about at the finish . For the record , just one of Bear Paw 's three runs was earned , but no doubt about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposing us got the fat of his bat on a damn gopher ball and hit it about three cow pastures beyond my left fielder . We kept pecking away , though , and at the bottom of the ninth , with only three outs to go , led by four runs . The first two men to come up we disposed of by a couple of miracles . Terry Stephens was catching , in the absence of our regular man who worked at Brick 's Butcher and Locker Shop and had had to slaughter a steer , Sunday being no excuse for a let-up in blood-letting . The first batter fouled a ball that would have sailed over the back screen if there 'd been one , or into the press box of a bigcity park . Terry charged back for it , trampling a couple of kids and a dog in his chase but somehow keeping his feet . At the last minute , falling , he speared it . The second man up socked a line drive that our center fielder could n't  | have caught in a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the count , for he hauled the drive in over his shoulder . Only one out to go , and some of the spectators were drifting away . So I walked the next man on four pitches . The next scratched a single . The next got on base when our shortstop fumbled his grounder . Bases loaded , then , and the tying run at the plate . The fans decided they were leaving too soon . They were . Wild as a blind gunner , I walked in a run . I hit the next batter , and a second run scored . And at bat was that comedian who had murdered a pitch in the first inning . Our manager ? Felix Underwood , the undertaker ? lagged out on the field to ask if I thought I should be embalmed , there being a live replacement of sorts . The dying man said he felt fine and was left to his fate . I worked the count , or the comedian worked the count , to three and two . Terry Stephens came out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jase , " and scuffed the ground , stalling for time . " You 'll get him , the bastard . Blaze one through . " " Sure . Sure , Terry . Some foul catch you made . " Back of the plate again , Terry signaled for a fast ball , knowing I had better control with it than with a curve . But that joker at the plate was expecting a hard one , I felt sure , so I shook the sign off and fed the joker a curve that just caught the corner of the plate and left him looking . That was it , naturally , though the umpire got some hell for his call . I knew why I lost control there in the ninth , though I  | would n't have confessed under torture . To get the picture , as they say , you must understand that those country-town ball parks had no grandstands or bleachers , only a couple of benches for players . People sat on the ground or stood up , back of the lines from home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them watched from back of the catcher , to the rear of the postage-stamp backstop behind him , where they could make sure whether the umpire was blind . Drivers parked their cars beyond the sitters and standers , and a lot of the occupants looked on without getting out . Of the two I saw him first , there at the end of the eighth inning . He was a trim , older man who wore a necktie , glasses and a Vandyke beard and appeared too bookish for baseball , but you never knew . In our region the national game was hanging on long after it had been reduced elsewhere to Little Leaguers and Babe Ruthers or whatever they called those tadpole teams . We had town teams , supported by townspeople , and the local loyalties were fierce . But whatever side he was on , I figured the old gentleman ? that was the word for him ? had come from his car to be in at the finish . Then I saw the girl who moved up to his side , or , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better words than freshness and loveliness , I would use them to describe her . She was like a rare flower , sprung up by magic from the weed patch . The lines of an old trail song , sung by Terry to the soft strumming of his guitar , ran in my head . Eyes like the morning star , Cheeks like the rose .. .  | It was for her that I performed in that ninth inning . It was because of her that I performed poorly . Self-display goeth before bases on balls . Bear Paw lay , and still lies , thirty miles from my old hometown , all of them via the new highway except for the turnouts into the two settlements . In spite of the traffic , which was pretty heavy because of the tourists and a just-ended rodeo farther up the line , we made pretty good time . Five of us were in Terry 's car , owned by his old man , and five in Felix Underwood 's , which tailed us on the way home . Ten players were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my town ? which were two in number and , for lack of overpasses or underpasses , were both open to either exit or entry ? were separated by a half-mile or less . We had decided on the second and lower road because it ran next to Hamm 's Big Hamburger stand . But we had n't gone far past the first turnout than traffic slowed and came to a standstill , coming and going . A lot of adventurers , balked in their pursuits of paved distance , were leaning on their horns . Their combined blasts would have satisfied the deafest of rock-music hounds . And ahead , we could barely see , a bunch of people , afoot , had gathered around something we could n't see . " Accident , " Terry said . We piled out of the car , my officer 's duty running high even in a baseball suit . The others followed me as we  | pushed through the gathering crowd to the march music of honks . There , smack in one lane , lay a horse in harness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curiosity blocked the other . Then I saw Chick Charleston bending over the horse and an old codger bent over him . It took me a second to recognize Plenty Toogood . Charleston gave an abrupt " Good ! " to my " Hi , Sheriff . " Before he could go on , Toogood broke in . " Old Rex ai n't dead , goddam your eyes ! " Felix Underwood , who ought to know , had pushed up for a look and a feel . He stood up to report , " Not yet . " Charleston nodded to the diagnosis , straightened and turned to Terry and me . " Terry , " he said , " get the boys out . Post them at the turnouts . Have them flag down the drivers and route them through town . " " What with ? " Terry asked . " Your hats are red . So are your socks . Fix them on your bats . " " Right . " " And , Terry , when they can , have the stalled cars back up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and old Rex 's , tell those horn players it 's intermission . " Terry went away , and Charleston told me , " You , Jase , see if you can chase up Old Doc Yak . " Running , I wondered what Doc Yak could do . He was n't above treating a horse , or a dog for that matter , since we had no resident vet , but how minister to an old bag-of-bones pelter that had decided to lie down and die ?  | Doc Yak was n't home . He was n't at his office . Then I saw his wreck of a car parked in front of the Bar Star Saloon . He was n't one of those storybook , boozy medical men , but on occasion he was known to add a quick shot to his own store of restoratives . I hurried him out of the place or would have done so if necessary . You could n't hurry Doc because he was always in a hurry himself . He put his car into first gear first , which was like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going . He should have been careful backing out , for the traffic from the highway had begun rolling through . When we had got as close to the scene as we could , Doc grabbed his bag and hopped out , leaving his car to roll to a stand in Duke Appleby 's yard . Duke got his lawn mower out of the way just in time , seemed about to yell something , then saw who the driver was and just smiled . The situation was changing . There were the down horse and the buggy and Charleston , Toogood , Underwood and a few of the curious standing by , but the cars had thinned out , and the drivers were n't honking as if honks could waft away a dead horse . Terry and the boys were doing their job . Doc did n't speak as he forged ahead to the patient . Anyone could see the horse was still breathing . Doc thumbed one of its eyelids and then forced its jaws open . He stood up to ask , " Just how goddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not as old as you by a damn sight . " We were interrupted by a new arrival , a state patrol- man , who said , " Hi , Chick , " to Charleston . " What 's the hitch ? " His arrival prodded Plenty into an explanation that I guessed he 'd made earlier and often . " It was one of your men , damn your eyes , " he told the patrolman . " That 's the hitch . Just last week your pretty-prim joy boy said I could n't see good enough to drive my car anymore . Said hell to pay if I did . " The patrolman said , " Yes ? " " Well , by God , old Rex sees good enough . Give him an eye test . Try arrestin ' him , will you ? " The patrolman looked funny . " So what do I do , havin ' my car took out from under me , so to speak ? I hitched up old Rex to that buggy there . Ai n't been used for a coon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Ford , you can bet your ass . Then I hit out for town . Would have made it , too , was n't for these hellcrazy drivers , tearin ' by , honkin ' or draggin ' ass to watch , like as if a horse and buggy had no right to the road . Damn their eyes ! " " What was the hurry ? I mean , the purpose ? " " Hurry ? Christ save me . To get to town . What else ? " While they had been talking , a sort of biography ran through my mind . Old Plenty Toogood had a place south of McNair 's . It was a little haywire ranch held together by the squaw he said he was married to . Milk cow , chickens , a few hogs , maybe thirty beef cattle , all mostly tended by her . He said he was too old for hard work and , for that matter , probably was . But he was n't too old for a drink or a dozen , which I guessed was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , though we already saw , " See ! I told you . " The horse had climbed to its feet . It stood drooping , ribs and hip bones showing and its ancient muscles a little atremble , but it stood . " Nothin ' the matter with him , " Plenty told us . " Except exhaustion , " Doc Yak put in . Charleston added , " And shock . " " Goddam right , " Plenty said as if struck by a fresh idea . " Shock . These run-for-Jesus highways shock the shit out of better men than old Rex . " " Can he make it to the courthouse , taking it easy ? " Charleston asked . " Why not ? " " Get along then . I 'll see you there , " Charleston said . " We 'll make arrangements to get you and your outfit back to the ranch . Not tonight . I 'll find a place for the horse , and you can put up at the jail . " " Jail ! And slam the bars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Naw . Naw , " the sheriff said . " Just friendly accommodations . Get along . " Toogood climbed into the buggy , the like of which could n't be seen except in museums , and slapped the old horse with the reins while he clucked to it . The horse moved , bowed by the weight of centuries like the man with the hoe . Doc Yak picked up his bag . Felix Underwood started back toward his car . The patrolman smiled before leaving . " No charge , " he said to Charleston . " Unless cruelty to old animals , including old Toogood . " When they had all gone , Charleston turned to me.  | " Soon as Ben Hur turns into town , you can disperse your posse , Jase . Tell the boys I 'll set up the hamburgers . Meet you there . " Walking away , I was struck with the thought that , some way , among our lists of suspects for Buster Hogue 's shooting , Plenty Toogood had been lost in the shuffle . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him a question . I had n't gone far , though , until Charleston called , " Make it one down , Jase . " It took me a minute to figure that out .  | THERE WAS NO WORK for me the next day , or none to speak of . Again I appeared at the office in good time , thinking perhaps we 'd drive out for more interviews , but the sheriff had a more pressing engagement than that of corralling a sniper . " County commissioners are meeting today , " he said after reporting that Buster Hogue was still alive but still blotto . He shuffled papers under his hand on the desk . " Reports , bills , authorizations , all that stuff . Pisswillie . And though it 's none of their business , they 'll be curious about our crime wave . Damn curious . " " Especially Reverend Hauser , " I said . The reverend had been elected because the pulpit made - him an honest man . My family being medium religious , I had been exposed to his on-high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charleston , " You ever hear him preach ? " Charleston gave me his smile , which sometimes but not now said more than his words . " I never heard him do anything else , " he answered . " Why do n't you go fishing , Jase ? Wish I could . " I did n't go right away because a start at that hour would have put me on the river in the heat of the day , an  | unlikely time to catch trout . I hung around after he 'd left and fooled around with my mail-order fingerprinting set which , the advertisement had indicated , would transform a simpleton into a sleuth . I had n't brought my baseball along because my arm was sore from wild pitches . In the jail was a roustabout , arrested for assaulting his wife , failure to support six snotty kids and other assorted charges , all of which could be proved to nobody 's benefit . Jimmy Collins told me the man wanted to see me . He was one of those men , born a nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than that . A harsh judgment but my own at the time . Even so , I could feel sorry for him . " Hi , Claude , " I said through the bars . " You want to do me a favor , kid ? " " Depends , " I answered . His eyes , streaked with red , and his face , swollen and painted by whiskey , suggested he wanted the drink I could n't bring him . " That goddam Buster Hogue ! " he said . " If there was any man in him , he 'd bail me out . " " From the hospital ? " " You know what he did ? He gave me my time , that 's what . No reason a-tall . Just hustled me to town and dumped me off and shorted me to boot on my pay . " " When ? " " When ? How do I know when ? I got drunk . Would n't you , bein ' treated so mean ? " Jimmy Collins had come up to listen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " I guess so . Ask somebody . " " Who locked you up ? " Jimmy said , " I did . Off duty , too . " " What day , Jimmy ? " " Aw , the time fits , Jase , but nothin ' else does . It was late Thursday night . No . Way early Friday morning , his missus called me . He ai n't no culprit , not of the shootin ' . You think Chick would n't have got on to him if he was ? " Charleston would have , of course . Any fool would have known that much . Claude was saying , " About that favor , kid ? " What he wanted was an ad in the paper , thanking his friends for their kindnesses while he was behind the bars and , more than that , suggesting earnestly that he would appreciate further expressions of sympathy . I asked him , " Who pays ? " " Boy , " he answered , after searching the pockets he knew were empty , " it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can trust you just like you can trust me . " In the office I wrote out a little ad , being weakened by his reasoning , and showed it to Jimmy . Jimmy grinned in approval . " You know , his wife , bunged up as she was , brought him sandwiches and a cake , damned if she did n't . And two pals twice come in with a half-pint . I passed ' em on . What the hell , Jase ? The law do n't believe in cruel and unusual punishment . Now he 's thirsty again and wants a repeat . " I took the ad to the Clarion and paid for it . It cost thirtyfive cents . Afterward , I picked up grub at the Commercial Cafe  | for Jimmy 's two guests , delivered it and went home for lunch . My father said I could have the car , as long as it was fish and not fowl I meant to pursue . By " fowl " he meant pullets , which was another name he used for my dates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that oversize trout , that wowser , that I had seen in the big hole alongside the picnic grounds . But I would n't start there . I would drive above it and fish downstream , hitting the hole along about sunset . There was good fishing on the way to it , in the neighborhood of the gully that hid Pierre Chouquette 's place . It was another one of those days , bright as new brass , with not a cloud anywhere . It was hot enough for you , as people ask in their sweat , lacking anything else on their minds , but it would cool off later on , and a man would feel released from midday embrace . I always thought of late afternoon as kitten-fur soft . In the Northwest we have days like that , day after summer day of burning sun and hot breeze , and grain farmers look at the sky , fearing hail . Then come the late-afternoon cool and the hours of nobreeze , and all is right in the world . The sun was relenting when I pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I figured , a wet fly , rather large , would work better than a dry midget , and so I tied to my leader a Size 8 Royal Coachman , that old reliable . From the beginning the fishing was good , if not extraordinary . By the time I came opposite Pierre Chouquette 's gulch , I had ten trout in my creel , all good size for the pan . Some of them were cutthroats , the best eat- ing , and some rainbows , the gamest . Together they made a good mess , as my old man would have said . I decided then that I 'd walk up the gulch and , on my own , talk to Pierre , provided he had returned . So I shortened my line and fixed the hook to the cork of the rod 's butt and set out on that quarter-mile stroll . Before I saw Pierre , I knew he was home , for his old team stood in the shade of the barn , fighting flies , and his lumber wagon was pulled up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , barking a log with a draw knife . Someone must have ordered peeled logs for a cabin . He heard me before I told him hello and looked up and smiled . He was a small man and polite , though a hermit . Half French and half Cree or Chippewa , he had a complexion tinted like a Brown Leghorn egg . He hung his draw knife on a crotch of his sawbuck and waited for conversation . " Hard work , " I said . He made a little outward gesture of his hands , as if I had exaggerated , and cast a glance to the west . " Stop pretty soon , " he answered . " Do n't let me interfere . " He said , " Weather , it will . " I looked to the west , too , and could n't see a cloud , but I knew better than to challenge a man whose partner was nature . A mother blue grouse walked close to us , clucking to her unruly brood like a schoolteacher . " Guess you 've heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hope for Buster Hogue. "  | He answered , " Hogue ? " not with like or dislike or a show even of interest . " He 's unconscious yet , but the bullet did n't go through his skull . " " So " was all I got out of him . " You 've heard about the picnic and him getting shot in the head by somebody unknown ? " " I go to the mountains for logs . But shot he was , you say . No doubt . " " " In his bald spot , by the light of the moon . The sheriff 's hot on the trail of whoever did it . " " Many people do not like Buster Hogue . " " Including you , Pierre ? " His face did n't change . " Why not ? " " You do n't know who it was shot him ? Who might have ? No ideas ? " " Plenty idea , but ? " With a wave of his hand he gave his ideas to a breeze that had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Six . Maybe week . Maybe more . " He spoke like a man to whom days were a stream , one like another , without definition or date . There were ten or so other logs piled to the side of the one on the sawbuck , and I tried to figure how long it would take one man to get to the mountains , cut them and trim them , bring them back and unload . One man . Two horses . Eleven logs . X miles . An old grade-school problem popped into my head : If it takes one man ten days to perform a given task , how long will it take ten men , working half-days , to do the same thing ? Yeah , and how much wood would a woodchuck chuck ? ?  | Suddenly the breeze turned into gusts , and I could see low thunderheads rising from over the mountains . The weather bureau could do with Pierre . " Want coffee ? " he asked . " Thanks . I better get back to my car , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hard pelt of a rain that was so close to hail that I wondered about crops to the eastward . Lightning jagged down , one bolt so close it barely beat out its own thunder . Like most thunder showers , this one did n't last long . By the time I braked the car above the picnic grounds , the sky was clear over my head . Everything smelled good to me as I scrambled down the wet ridge . Everything ? grass , juniper , scrub pine ? breathed revival . The patches of gravel lay polished , each pebble clean and distinct . The sun was low in the west . It had started kindling a cumulus cloud . A good time to fish , to catch that prize cutthroat . The picnic grounds , that peaceful bottom , looked the same as when I 'd last seen it , except that Guy Jamison had taken his chuck wagon out . And except that the rain in its mercy had wiped away the rusty smirch of Buster Hogue 's blood . The peaceful bottom ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , haunting the place where a bullet had beaned him , hear him calling out " Who-o ? " like an owl as he hunted the ridge . Then I fished . I fished carefully , used wet flies and dry , all that I had in my book , and even bemeaned myself by baiting a plain hook with a grasshopper . But I could n't  | get rise or strike from the big trout I 'd seen . So I cleaned my catch at the river 's edge and then started climbing back up the ridge , using a chance course neither the sheriff nor I had followed before . If you go hunting arrowheads , go hunting after a rain . There was the reason , the rain , that I found it , a cartridge case , minus bullet , shining copper-bright in a patch of gravel close to the summit . It was a jacket like none I had seen . Centerfire , to be sure , and reduced as many were at the junction of charge and projectile , but still strange , strange at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the cap , was stamped the maker 's mark and with it the designation .303 SAV . I put it in my pocket .  | I GULPED MY SUPPER that night , having so much on my mind . Mother had exclaimed over the nice catch of fish and fed me some warmed-over flank steak with dressing and vegetables she had held back , knowing I would be late . I topped it all off with a piece of chocolate pie , eating it on the run , so to speak . In dry clothes , with a full stomach , I went looking for the sheriff . He was n't in his office or at the Bar Star or Commercial Cafe but answered , " Come in , " when I knocked at the door of the small apartment he rented in the Jackson Hotel . It was a pretty neat place , not woman-neat , what with books and magazines spread around , but neater than you 'd expect from an old bachelor . He kept spic and span the little kitchen in which he often did his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , at least as far as we knew . He had explained his single state once by saying , " I reckon I 've rolled too much to gather a missus . " Yes . Rolled over the best moss , I thought . " Sit down , Jase , " he said , motioning toward a hide-covered chair . " What about Salmo ? "  | " Who 's he ? " " The trout family . " " Oh , I caught a nice mess , nothing big . " I did n't have fishing on my mind , of course . I had Pierre Chouquette and , more important , the cartridge case in my pocket . My sense of the dramatic told me to mention the case in the third act . So I told him about my talk with Pierre , told it in detail while he listened without interrupting . When I had finished , he said , " Small potatoes and few to the hill . That was the crop forecast anyhow , Jase . " " He 's so polite but so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't mean anything . He 's shy . That 's why he lives like a hermit . He does n't hate people . They just make him uncomfortable . That 's my guess . " The thought never had struck me , but it was n't of any present importance , not when I was about to show what I had found . Before I could do so , he went on , " There are characters like that , a few , and they get a wrong reputation . Bunch quitters . The opposite of people like , say , Loose Lip Lancaster or , for that matter , even Mabel Main . " " Good night ! Have you talked to her ? " " Not lately . Why ? " " I forgot ! She stopped me on the street . I got the notion she might have something important to tell you . " " When ? " " Right after the shooting . " The sheriff sighed and said , " All right . " He shook his  | head then , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his head I said , " I have n't told it all , Sheriff . I fished that big hole by the picnic grounds and came back up the ridge a different way from before . " He looked at me with full attention , maybe suspecting my revelation already . The center of attraction likes to string things out . " It had rained , you know , " I told him . " Good time to spot arrowheads . " He endured me . It flashed in my mind that the twin lines at the sides of his mouth were n't all made by smiles . I asked , " Guess what I found ? " He would n't guess . Under that pressure my hand dived into my pocket , took out the cartridge case and gave it to him . He studied it for what seemed like minutes . " Yes , " he said then . " A Savage three-oh-three . Deer rifle . Long time since I 've seen one . " " Is it a clue ? " " What else ? About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent his head for a closer look at the case . His hair was beginning to show some gray at the edges . Aloud he asked himself , " A clue , but where does it lead us ? " I answered for him . " We could ask around about who owned one . " " And the owner would say , Sure . Take me in . ' " " I mean the neighbors . Those roundabout . " " Who , we would know , were n't the owners themselves . " Charleston was n't being sarcastic . He was just punching holes in my program . " Besides , Jase , " he continued ,  | " they 're a pretty closed bunch , nearly all with a grudge against Hogue , except Old Man McNair . As for him , he might have one cached away . " " You do n't think so . " " Not exactly . But , as the poet said , doth he protest his friendship too much ? " Charleston took a cigar from his pocket , examined it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jase . The case is a sure-enough clue . " He got up and laid it in the drawer of a chest . " Feel like a sandwich or something ? I do . " It was our luck to run into Buster junior and his brother Simon , called Simp , at the Commercial Cafe . The nickname was cruel and too easy . Simple Simon was n't simple , unless you could call craziness simple . He was a man off to himself , away from the real , in some world his shadowed mind kept creating . When you addressed him , he might explode with a ho or a yah , or he might explode without provocation ; but for the most part he mumbled aloud to himself , in slurred words no one could relate to the going-on conversation . Once in a while , for no reasons at all except for those known to him alone , he would bump , shoving , through the people around him and whoop at those seen or unseen or both . And once in a while , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make sense . I-le was n't often brought into town , and , when he was , no one called him Simp , not in the presence of Junior . No , sir . There were half a dozen other customers in the place , seated and standing , eating and gabbing . Their eyes came to the door as we entered . To the man at his right  | ? Tad Frazier , it was ? Buster Junior said , loud enough for everybody to hear , " Salute the flag , boys . Stand up for law and order . " Charleston paid no attention . He took a seat near the door and motioned me to one next to him , and , when Jessie Lou came up the counter to see what we 'd have , ordered a ham-and-egg sandwich and coffee . I did the same . " Law and order , " Junior said , again to the company but for our benefit . " In this town the order is for the law to drag ass . " Charleston kept silent , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goading him just the same . Junior leaned forward on the counter so as to get a good view of the sheriff . " You hear me up there ? " Before he answered , Charleston took a sip of water from the glass Jessie Lou had set out . " I hear , " he said , and gave a little smile to the glass . " Instead of makin ' an arrest , " Junior said , speaking to everybody again , " what does he do ? He low-rates my old man . Tries to run down his name . As if any son of a bitch could ! " Jessie Lou slid the sandwiches to us , a worried look in her eyes . I could feel an eagerness in the rest , the eagerness of men to see other men fight . The rights of the case did n't matter . Who might win was of secondary importance . Junior 's words were fighting words , so let 's you two fight . Charleston took a bite of his sandwich and began chewing thoughtfully .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What you got to say ? " " I 'm hungry . " After a pause Charleston added , " Let the condemned man eat . " Simp broke out with " Ho " to somebody unseen . The sheriff moved to have a look at him . Simp sat unnoticing , his lips working , as if nothing was happening here to compare with the events of his world . " If it was n't for that goddam tin star ! " Junior said . Charleston went on eating . It began to look like no contest , with Junior the winner by default , to the general disappointment . With everybody else quiet , Simp 's mumbles sounded plain , but mysterious . Charleston ate the last of his sandwich , took a sip of coffee , wiped his mouth and turned on his stool . His voice was mild . " I 'd like to talk to you , Junior . " " Talk . Talk ! Jesus Christ ! Talk about what ? " " Maybe about what makes you a damn fool . " The tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged up . For a minute I thought he would swing , star or no star . Charleston looked in his eyes , not moving , his face composed . In the end I think it was that very control that got Junior . It fazes you , at the moment of action , to face a man who sits calm , not angry but not afraid either . Anyhow , Junior did n't swing . He held on to his storm long enough for a last bolt . " Talk ! I 'm a son of a bitch ! " Charleston nodded , to either the first or the second part of Junior 's reply or to both . " Then , later , who knows ?  | No rule says I have to take my star to bed with me . " " Meanin ' ? " " Just what you think . Let 's go to the office . " Junior turned slowly , like a man just reconciling himself to a compromise , and commanded , " Simon ! Come on . " Simp yelled , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block , left his stool and came toward us . I got up as Charleston did . Junior said , pointing to me , " He goin ' to play catch with us ? " " Want to bring your sandwich along , Jase ? " Charleston asked . That answered that , though I abandoned the sandwich . We went out , the four of us , leaving a rising chatter behind us . There would be talk about where the fight would be if there was one . In the office the sheriff motioned us all to seats after I had brought in a chair . He let himself down at his desk . Old Jimmy poked his head through the rear door , announced he had nothing to report and asked if it was all right if he went . A man who 's known everything has no curiosity left . Charleston started easily . " Two things first , Junior . One , I 'm after the man that shot your father . Second , I have n't downgraded him . If I mentioned his deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would help me locate the sniper . I did mention it , to old McNair . That 's who told you . You and I know , so do others , that the deal was on the shady side . That does n't matter now . " " The goddam Forest Service . "  | " All right . I 've talked to most of the people present at the picnic , I admit with no results . I ca n't even guess yet . I need your help . Let 's start with McNair . " " Old Taller-Ass is our friend . Good reasons , but I would n't tell you even if I knew all of it . " " No need to . Statute of limitations applies to everything except murder . " Charleston picked up a pencil and studied it . While he studied , Simp muttered , his eyes blank . Charleston 's gaze flicked to him before he went on . " Obligations , " he said . " Sometimes they weigh on a man . " " What do you mean by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . " " Nuts ! McNair is an ornery old bastard all right , but you 're on the wrong horse . " " I 'm not on him . I 'm just sizing him up . " Simp blurted out , " Yah , " not to second the motion . " People I have n't seen , Jase and I , " Charleston went on . He was making pencil marks on his blotter . " Professor Powell Hawthorne , for one . " " Stuck-up son of a bitch . Goes for his girl , too , or part of it . " " You know them well ? " " Not well but enough . Christ , she would n't speak to you if you were the last man on earth . " Charleston 's eyes lifted to Junior . I wondered if he was wondering the same thing that I was , even if junior did have a wife . Junior hitched in his chair . " Shut up , Simon ! " Simon answered , " Yo , " and went on jabbering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not so goddam mysterious , " Junior said , hitching back . " You mean Ben Day ? " " Well ? " " On the face of it , yes , " Charleston answered , making more marks on the blotter . " That 's the trouble . Too obvious . Whatever Day is , the first thing is cagey . Unlikely to put his foot in a plain-to-see trap . Yes or no ? " " I could see myself doin ' it , bein ' Day . " " Sure . But you are n't . Let 's get on . Doctor Ulysses Pierpont ? We have n't seen him . " " That fake ! " " Oh ? " " What I mean is ? what the truth is ? anyone says he can cure what 's wrong in a head is loco himself . Or a damn cheat . " " Seems you know him ? " " Some . He came to the ranch once , all polite business . What he wanted was to buy land off us . We laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we buy it , and so we laughed . Later on ? " " Later on , what ? " " Nothin ' . He do n't wear well . " Charleston heaved in a breath and sighed it out . " I guess that 's all , Junior . But I aim to find that sniper . I aim to bring him in , no matter who he is or who sets up a howl . Got that ? That what you want ? " " Well , of course , sure I do . " " If I do n't , I 'll turn in my badge . That 's a promise . " As if reminded , he took his star off , laid it on his desk and looked at Junior , his eyes questioning .  | It took Junior a minute , but finally he said , " I do n't guess so . Not now , anyhow . " Then for the first time he got my sympathy by saying , " It 's my own father . " " I know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well have been in the next county for all the attention he paid . " By the way , " the sheriff asked , " you happen to own a Savage three-oh-three ? " Junior looked puzzled . " We did once . I guess it 's still lyin ' around the ranch somewhere , maybe in the bunkhouse . Why ? " It was then that Simp sprang his fit . He came out of his chair as if goosed , shouting commands or alarms to his unseen company , and lunged for the door , knocking Junior half out of his chair . Junior said , " Simon . Now , Simon . Easy , boy . " But Simp charged from the office , still howling , and Junior went after him . We sat still , the sheriff and I , and after a while , from far down the hall , heard Simp say , " Please , Junior , is n't it time to go home ? " " Psychological , " Charleston said then . " Out of my reach . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went on , " First thing in the morning I 'll call Doctor Pierpont and ask him to drop in soon as he can . " " About Simp ? " All Charleston answered was , " Pitiful. "  | FROM THE PROTECTION of a sheep panel Ben Day was shooting at me . I could see him through the slats , sneaking from one position to another , and could see the rifle poking through . It was a Savage .303 . Against the gun I had a baseball , but I could n't throw it , wild or true . My arm hung paralyzed . Day called as he aimed , " Now , boy , " but it was my father speaking . Through the mists I heard him add , " I thought you 'd want to get up , son . It 's pretty late . " His hand tousled my hair . I rolled over . " Thanks , Dad , " I said . " My arm 's asleep . " I waved it and rubbed it with my other hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well you might , " he told me . " Buster Hogue is dead , according to the radio . " I came fast out of bed . " So now it 's murder ! " He said , " I fear so , " and left my room , shaking his head . He would rather I pitched ball than pried into crime . On the mound a man could get shelled : history could n't cite a case in which one had been shot . Only Halvor Amussen was in the sheriff 's office , working  | the day shift so 's he 'd have the night off . He was a big man , big enough to eat hay , and I often wondered about his well-known if unauthenticated exploits in bed . It was hard to picture him wrestling on a regulation fourposter . He told me the sheriff was attending a sheriff 's sale out in the country but had learned about Buster Hogue 's death before setting out . " A blessing , I call it , " Halvor said . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Lots of people do and seem to like it all right . " " Uppity , are you ? " he asked . " But , looking at you , I guess you 're right . " There was nothing to do except wait for lunch and the sheriff 's return later on . So I spent some time in what I thought of as thought . Suspects ? Old Man McNair , whom Charleston showed some unaccountable interest in . Loose Lancaster , who reported Hogue had taken off a hat later shown to be punctured . Plenty Toogood was out . He could n't see to drive , let alone aim a rifle by moonlight . Out , too , I supposed , were Blue Piatt and Oscar Oliphant , whom Charleston had talked to the night I rolled the hearse to the hospital . No need to think about Guy Jamison and his dudes . Ben Day ? Unlikely . Too cagey . Chouquette ? Small potatoes and few to the hill . Though we had n't talked to either , to suspect the psychiatrist or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my mind it all simmered down to Simp Hogue , that crazy , lost bastard . Motive ? One of his secret own that made no sense to sane men . Having solved the case , I decided to write a report of  | all that had gone on , beginning with Buster Hogue 's delivery by truck . A straining of memory , you might think , but it was n't , not much . In my old-fashioned grade school , where you were required to memorize line after line after line of pieces the English teacher thought great , I won steady A 's without effort . Things read or heard imprinted themselves on my mind , there to stay . I ca n't see any special , personal benefit in being able to recite " Evangeline " or " The Man with the Hoe " or " The Lady of Shalott " line by line without a bobble , but the faculty of remembering served me well in making out the report , which I left unfinished and hidden at lunchtime . I would go on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charleston particularly , was to see it . The sheriff returned to the office at 1:30 by the clock on the wall , said hello , he was tied up for a while , but would I like to take a trip later on , say , after supper ? I said I would and , wondering how to spend a long afternoon , assembled my fingerprinting kit and took it home . Whenever Halvor saw me working with it , he addressed me as Sherlock or Hawkshaw . Along the street and in the Commercial Cafe , where I stopped for a Coke , as well as in the post office and Bar Star , I supposed , people were talking and shaking their heads , saying , even those who had not liked him too well , it was too bad Buster Hogue had kicked off . A good man , Hogue , whatever his not-mentioned failings . A solid Republican who had never sought office , a man who gave of himself and his cash to causes thought worthy . For years a member of the state central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy had been felt far and wide . A good man , yep , and too bad . Everybody 's loss . Ranchers and cowtowns are generally Republican , which partly accounted for the general sentiment . Irrigation districts and wheat elevators mark the Democrats ' habitats , where the blight of government interference is promoted . Once , having been smarted up by a teacher , I asked a cattleman if the tariff was n't government interference . It was n't . A shower came up while I walked , and I hurried on home , where Mother remarked that a beef stew was n't a beef stew without the rutabagas she could n't find in the stores . In my room I fiddled with my fingerprinting kit . It included an ink pad , paper , lifting tape , powder and brush , but not the camera that would have accompanied a costlier set . There was in the room , in addition , a book on fingerprint classification that the FBI had sent me on being assured of my interest . To date I had n't got far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass for the purpose , I lifted a couple of pretty fair sets of my own prints . My old man came from the office a little later , and we ate . Both he and I thought the stew was damn good , though neither of us used the adjective , it being as contrary to his principles as the stew was agreeable to his taste . When we were done , I said I might be out late , seeing as I was going on a trip with the sheriff . " To where ? " my dad asked .  | " He did n't tell me . " " Keep in mind , " he said , " that a murder has been committed . The guilty man would n't hesitate at a second . " Mother chimed in . " Must you go ? " " Theirs not to reason why . Theirs but to do and die , " I answered , and tried to ease my mother 's worry with a good-bye kiss . I went to the sheriff 's office and waited . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun itself lost over the mountains , that Charleston came in and asked was I ready . God knows I was . On the way to the Special I asked him , " Where to ? " but all he answered was , " West . " So we tooled out the highway and took that rockyassed road again . We were keeping it hot , no matter how cold the trail grew . After the shower the air was newborn . Even the engine enjoyed it , purring along as if heaven had sent just the right mixture . The mountains scalloped the western sky as if scissored . Our dust rose lazily behind us and settled to rest . If there were sermons in stones , there was music in this quiet hour , music accompanied by the soft throb of the motor and the low drum of wheels against gravel . Neither of us spoke . It was n't until we turned to the right off the road and crossed a cattle guard into a lane that I knew where we were going . To Professor Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? and her ? by asking , as if I did n't care , who was that duded-up old gent with the whiskers who had showed up at the ball game . There were lights in the house , friendly lights that  | beamed into the gathering dark . A dog came out of somewhere to welcome us . You could tell from his bark that he would n't bite . We eased to a stop and got out , and a door opened , and the professor stood there with his Vandyke and raised a hand in salute . " Come in , Mr. Charleston , " he said , " you and your deputy . It was kind of you to phone first . " As I came into fuller light , he went on , " Do n't I recognize you ? Yes . The ballplayer . " " Jason Beard , " I told him . He shook hands with Charleston and me and motioned us in . The girl was there . She was what I noticed at first . She was all I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not many women can wear slacks without discouraging masculine interest . Too bulgy in front or too broad behind , or both , they suggest unbaked bread dough on the high rise . But she wore them and did n't . She had on , too , a bright blouse , mostly red , that showed she was female all right . Yet there was more to her than shape . There was a sort of radiance , like a dimmed light that could be switched to high beam . " Marguerite , " the professor said , " I do n't think you have met Sheriff Charleston or Jason ? " I helped him with " Beard . " " My daughter , gentlemen . I call her Geet for short , disliking the common Maggie . " She nodded nicely and on second thought came to us and offered a hand . It was strong enough but small and short-fingered for the Little Leagues . The room we were in ? the lodge room , he called it  | later ? struck me as just right . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it showed easy taste . It had a beamed ceiling and a native-stone fireplace in which a just kindled fire worked on aspen twigs . Against the end wall facing me was a high , solid-fronted cabinet with double locks . I saw a picture of Geet and one of an oil well gone wild . A coffee table supported books and magazines . They looked technical . After we were seated and had talked about the weather and what-not and the professor had mentioned my pitching approvingly , he asked if we would n't like some refreshments . He and the sheriff settled for bourbon and water . I said I was n't thirsty or hungry , either , though Geet brought in soft drinks and some homemade cookies that I could have gobbled . The sheriff picked up and examined a piece of stone that had been laid out with others on a small stand table close to his chair . " I confess with regret , " he said in his best manner , " that I know little about your profession , Professor . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' is ? shall we say ? vestigial , " Mr. Hawthorne said after a thoughtful sip from his glass . " I suppose I 'm still a geologist , but no longer a petroleum geologist . No longer . No . " " No ? " " They are on my conscience , my ecological conscience , the oil fields I was instrumental in finding . That work , those findings , have enabled me to retire , and so I should n't complain , I suppose , but sometimes I have the feeling I am living on the proceeds of wrong-doing . " He gestured toward the picture of the oil well gone wild . " There is a  | reminder of my leisure and my sin . Blessings have their price . " Though I came of a good family myself , I was about to decide he was too fine-haired for me . Who in hell did n't dream of striking oil ? Charleston nodded and smiled . The girl 's eyes were on him as he spoke . " I know a cattle rancher who curses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-rancher , I should say . But I doubt that stockholders and General Motors share your sentiment . " Mr. Hawthorne dismissed them with a wave of his hand . " Now I am far more interested in the history of earth . How it came to be . How it grew through the ages . What flora and fauna it supported in the years of its becoming . So I study and think and look and now and then gather a stone . Call me a rock hound , a fossil lover , a seeker of evidence of things , circumstances , creatures long vanished . " As speeches go , it seemed a pretty good speech , though rather airy . Good or bad , it was heightened or excused by the felt presence of Geet . No common-run father could have fathered her . " I am done with the exploitation of earth , " the professor went on . " Much better to do what Geet is doing . Next year she will have her degree in zoology . The order of Lepidoptera is her immediate interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that caused the girl to explain , " Butterflies and such . " All right . Butterflies and such . But here she was about to get a college degree when I had yet to earn my high- school diploma . That difference removed her yet made her more fetching . I told myself there was no rule against catching up . " But you did n't come to hear me talk about myself , " Mr. Hawthorne said abruptly . " No , " Charleston answered , " though your views are worth listening to , more interesting in the long haul than murder . " He smiled his easy smile . " With an oil well or two to my credit , I could dismiss the sins of others and concentrate on my own . " Geet laughed . " You know Hogue is dead , " Charleston continued . " How well were you acquainted with him ? " " We met a time or two . You may have heard he tried to buy my place , offering twice what it would bring on the market but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't understand my refusal . " " And you had words ? " " The tender of an offer and its rejection can hardly be managed without utterance . " A case or two flashed in my mind in which both had been managed with not a word said . Charleston was looking at the professor , without utterance conveying a message . The girl broke in . " Father , you 're being precious . " He gave her a small , benign smile . " Perhaps I am , my dear . " But the tone was set despite the admission , a tone I did n't like there in Geet 's presence . Charleston said , " You had words , then . "  | " We did n't quarrel , if that 's what you mean . Not really quarrel . It was hard for him to comprehend that some things existed beyond the embrace of his money . " " And that was all ? " " Not quite , if I am to make a clean breast of things , as you men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in possession of a piece of land on which rises a spring that feeds my pond here . He indicated , without actually threatening , that he might cut off the water supply unless I sold out . " " That 's enough for a quarrel . " " No . My water right is secure . I know it . He knew it , I 'm sure . Ours was n't an altercation . An altercation implies real heat . We just talked , admittedly not as friends . " " All right . " Charleston was insisting on being all business . " Now someone somewhere in this neighborhood shot Buster Hogue . Can you help me at all ? How well do you know your neighbors ? " " Far from well . Possibly you can except the Jamisons , brief as our acquaintance has been . Most of the rest I met for the first time at that unhappy picnic . " He looked at the empty glasses and said , " Geet , would you bring us another drink , please ? " In her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Hogue brothers ? Ben Day ? What do you know about them ? About any one ? Any least little thing that might have a bearing ? " " No help . Nothing . Very little hearsay , even . You see , Sheriff , we live pretty well apart , Geet and I. It 's a rare day we 're not off in the fields and the hills , pursuing our interests . It 's not that we shun society . We do n't have  | much time for it . And you must remember we are very recent arrivals here . " Geet brought the drinks in , on a tray naturally , since she had class . Both men thanked her , and she sat down , saying nothing . " As educated men , though in different fields , I would imagine you and Doctor Ulysses Pierpont have much in common , " the sheriff said . " Are you acquainted ? " Abruptly the girl said , " We know him . " " Slightly , only slightly , " her father answered before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sheriff , that you are wrong about common interests . " The girl 's gaze went to Charleston . " His manner toward Father was insulting , there at the picnic , when Father rushed to help poor Mr. Hogue . As if Father , himself a scientist , did n't know the rudiments of first aid . " " Now , now , Geet , " Professor Hawthorne said . " It 's no doubt that he feels perhaps just a little cool toward me since I refused to sell him this place . " He addressed Charleston then . " You know he wanted to buy it , or at least part of it ? " At Charleston 's nod Professor Hawthorne returned to common interests , or the lack of them . " Psychiatry , insofar as I have observed it , is an all-absorbing involvement , a specialty with little elbow room for other concerns , which is not to denigrate Doctor Pierpont or the profession . He is , I assume , a highly competent practitioner . Degrees like his are hard-won . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl said , as if clinging to a point that was being abandoned . Charleston answered , " Oh ? "  | " Once was enough . Once was too many . " She made a small flinging-away gesture . " Now , Geet , " her father said , " your dates , or date , are hardly germane to this inquiry . " " All right , but he 's impossible . Such delusions ! " " Of grandeur ? " Charleston asked . " Delusions of the illusion of grandeur . " Professor Hawthorne smiled and said in the soft tones of fatherhood , " Your character analysis is remarkable in view of the brief association . " She smiled in return and answered , " It 's a gift , Father ? the voices I hear . " " Uh-huh . And if , by your confusing abstractions , you mean the man has ambitions , then hurrah for him . At his age he should have . " Charleston had listened with a sort of alert amusement but now , apparently having had enough of Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in old firearms , Mr. Hawthorne ? " " Deal ' is hardly the word for a hobby . I collect rare pieces , some by barter , some by outright purchase . Collectors are a breed to themselves , Mr. Charleston . Sui generis , you might say . Some specialize in short arms , some in long , some in muzzle loaders , some in military arms . In acquiring what they want , in trading , that is , they often accept additional items of little interest to them but of some little , or perhaps great , interest to other collectors . These constitute their trading stock . " He lifted his glass . He seemed to be enjoying himself , as much with his hobby as he had with earth 's history . He waved toward the closed and locked cabinet . " My aim  | has been to collect pieces that reflect progress in armsmaking , those and the rifles , or muskets , that relate to given periods and certain events . They overlap often , of course . In that cabinet is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springfield fired by a trooper of Custer 's on the Little Bighorn , both well authenticated . I have a fine Henry , a first-year Winchester and a number of Kentuckys , more properly called Pennsylvanias . But why go on ? " Charleston forged on . " You were talking trade recently . " " Why , yes . By telephone . " It came to me then that Charleston had seen Mabel Main . " A collector in Louisville , Kentucky , has a very fine Hawken , " the professor continued . " It is one of the very few extant and one of fewer that has not been mutilated by amateurs . The Hawken was the fur-hunter 's rifle , you know . " He laughed and said , " Let me digress . I had a time making connections by phone . We are on a party line here , as you are aware . More properly it could be called a mass line . There is one instrument in particular , that of a widow and her two teen-age daughters , that is in operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us on the line . They were talking , of course , when I wished to put through my call . They talked , and they talked , but I outwitted them finally . There is an electric outlet close to my phone . I plugged into it an old , clattery shaver , lifted the receiver and let it clatter in the transmitter . " He laughed again . " That did for the wenches , as I choose  | to call them . No doubt they 're blaming the telephone company now , which does n't bother me in the slightest . " " You 're giving yourself away , Father , " the girl said . I could take that statement two ways . " Oh , well . " He shrugged . " But back to the Hawken , Mr. Charleston . The owner 's prime interest is short arms , and just recently I 've come into possession of some very good ones . I thought I might make a trade . It disappointed me that I did n't . " As if the thought had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . Not much escapes you , does it ? " The girl 's gaze was on the sheriff , as it had been during most of the conversation . Did it betray reserve , opposition , unwilling interest ? I could n't tell . Charleston asked , " Are you acquainted with the Savage three-oh-three ? " " Surely . Deer rifle . It 's becoming somewhat scarce but not sufficiently rare yet to tempt real collectors . Matter of fact , I have one , not important enough to lock in the cabinet and in poor condition besides . It 's too loose in the breach for safe firing . Possibility of a blow-back , you understand . " " May I see it ? " " Of course . " Mr. Hawthorne turned to his daughter . " Geet , will you bring it out of the storeroom ? " She disappeared , only to return in a minute and report , " It 's not there , Father . " " Not there ? Of course it is , stacked along with the Harper 's Ferry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked . " Mr. Hawthorne got up with an abrupt , " Excuse me. "  | The girl followed him out as if to prove her point . Charleston sat , with nothing in his face I could read . " I ca n't understand it , " Mr. Hawthorne said as he and Geet came back to the room . " I know I stored it there . Now who would steal that old piece ? " He paused . " I gather that a three-oh-three is important to your investi-gation ? " The sheriff said , " Yes . " " If anyone fired that old gun , he may have powder burns on him . " " You say you are gone from the house a great deal . Do you lock the place up ? " " My name may suggest the east , Mr. Charleston , but my heritage is early western . So I never lock doors . " " Except those to your gun cabinet . " " The one exception . Gun fanciers are n't to be trusted . I 'm lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the Savage . " " You know its number ? " " Naturally . " Mr. Hawthorne stepped to a desk , slid back a drawer and answered while he read from a page . " It 's Model eighteen ninety-nine , number **27;0;TOOLONG . " Charleston had taken a pad from his pocket and made note of the description . Now he stood up . " Thank you for your help . " " Help ? You do n't think ? " " Seldom if ever . Thanks to you , too , Miss Marguerite , and good night to you both . " I followed with my thank-yous , not that they got much attention . Leaving , Charleston turned back to say , " You may just  | have mislaid it . If it turns up , will you let me know ? " Assured that they would , he led along to the Special . Ours was mostly a silent trip home . What kept me quiet , what fretted me , was n't the matter of murder and what clues we had picked up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawthorne . It was him and that beautiful daughter of his . On close acquaintance would I find her as affected as he had appeared ? Like father like daughter ? Come to think of it , he and Buster Hogue , if different in their ways , had a quality in common . That was the assurance , the touch of superiority , the assumption of specialty that money generates in some men . And now I remembered from my reading the source of that doublejointed adjective that had occurred to me earlier . It came from a bit of verse left by Black Bart , the California bandit , after he had held up a stagecoach . I 've labored long and hard for bread , For honor and for riches , But on my toes too long you 've tred , You fine-haired sons of bitches . Out of the silence Charleston said , " You seem a mite fidgety , Jase . Look in the jockey box and get your mind on your business . " I opened the glove compartment , as easterners call it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand that had too long neglected its duty . Near town Charleston remarked as if to himself , " Damn likely girl , " and that was the end of our conversation until we gave each other good night .  | DR . ULYSSES PIERPONT was not at all what his name suggested . I had expected to see a large and stately man with wisdom written deep in his face . Or possibly a modem version of General Ulysses S. Grant , whose ability would be flavored with booze . But Dr. Pierpont turned out to be a rather small man with a trim mustache , a pointed gray gaze , a flat stomach and clothes that spelled tailor-made . " Spruce " was a word for him . We , the sheriff and I , were in his apartment when a quiet knock came at the door . After Charleston had opened it , I heard the visitor say , " Good evening . I came as soon as I conveniently could . Doctor Ulysses Pierpont , and you are Sheriff Charleston , I suppose . Your man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The sheriff made him welcome . Charleston and I had eaten supper at his place , enjoying steaks that a grateful rancher had provided after Charleston had collared a shoot-and-run rustler who had made off with a beef . An evening chill had set in , and Charleston had just closed a window when the knock sounded . After some little talk about nothing much , the sheriff  | told Dr. Pierpont , " I thought you might help me . About the murder , of course . I can pick up clues , if there are any , and I can make deductions , right or wrong . I 've even been known to have some hunches as to human behavior . But in this case there are no clues , no deductions , no hunches . I 'm stumped . " Dr. Pierpont turned his sharp gray gaze on me and shifted it back to the sheriff . He was asking , I felt sure , whether I had a proper part here . Charleston answered yes with his silence . " I fail to understand , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the picnic , I treated him as best I was able . I had and I have no idea who the marksman might be . " Dr. Pierpont spoke briskly , but after consideration , as if his thoughts had to be well shaped before voiced . " I have little acquaintance with those at the picnic , and , needless to say , I 'm not a detective . How then may I help ? " " My barnyard psychology is n't up to the mark , " Charleston answered , smiling . " Sheriffs are n't elected for brains , Doctor Pierpont . They get into office because they 're hail-fellow-well-met , or maybe they 've come out top dog in a fight . So , knowing my limits , I thought to extend them by talking to you . " Dr. Pierpont did n't smile in return . He listened as if to a troubled patient and waited for more . " I want an expert 's insight . I want to know what a given character is capable of and what he is n't . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily suspects . "  | " Surely you do n't expect me to answer offhand ? I fear what you hope from me requires a knowledge of personalities that I do n't possess . And if I did , professionally I could n't divulge it . " " We will treat the questions and answers as confidential , Doctor , and , more than that , hypothetical when that is demanded . You are acquainted with Simon Hogue , son of Buster ? " " Obviously you know he was my patient . " Charleston considered . " No , " he said , " I did not know that . Nobody does . " " Then I 'm sorry . " Into a moment 's pause Charleston said , " I forgot to offer you a drink . What will it be ? " " A small whiskey , if you have it . No water or ice . " The drink seemed appropriate to the man . I got up and went to the kitchen . Charleston liked water mixed with his bourbon . When I returned , Charleston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's plain to all that Simon needs help . The news that he 's been to you , if ever released , could n't cinch a case already cinched . " " An inexcusable stigma still often attaches to those who seek the aid of psychiatry . " The doctor took a sip of his whiskey . " As if everybody , worldwide , on occasion did n't need therapy . " " Granted , " Charleston replied . " I figure all of us are a little bit crazy , and some of us crazier than that some of the time . " " Crazy ' is not a term I use . "  | " No . What would you say about Simon Hogue ? " " I can say this much , now that I 've said as much as I have . I had six meetings with the boy . I thought he showed improvement and would show more . But Buster Hogue , his father , became disgusted that I had n't performed an instant miracle and terminated the treatments . " " " Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if all mental and emotional disturbances could be sorted , labeled and pigeon-holed . You call him crazy , others would say insane , still others perhaps feeble-minded . Psychiatry has its own terminology , but no term is exact . " Dr. Pierpont took a last sip of his drink as if to aid in his phrasing . " Let us just say , loosely again , that he suffers from schizophrenia . " " Here is the question in my mind , " Charleston went on . " Could a boy , or a man if you please , plan and carry out a shooting ? a man or a boy so afflicted , I mean ? And a shooting like Buster Hogue 's , I mean , too ? " Dr. Pierpont gave thought to the question , his slim , keen face lost in the answer . Then he replied , " This is hypothetical , as you say . Let me get away from Simon . Let me generalize . Then I shall have to give a qualified yes . It is not impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reference to Simon , understand ? could plot and perform such a crime . We see stranger things , we in the profession . " The sheriff finished his drink , and I went out to the kitchen for refills . But I could still hear . " Thanks , " the sheriff was saying out of my sight .  | " That 's one thing I know or at least must consider . But motive ? Can you tell me , without ethical strain , whether Simon disliked or hated his father ? " I came back in , served the drinks and sat down . " No strain because there is nothing to divulge , " Dr. Pierpont replied . " It was difficult to get anything at all out of Simon . But if I may speak generally again , I 'll tell you what you already know . Most sons harbor an antagonism , latent or active , for their fathers . " He added after a silence , " Perhaps , among other influences , that feeling is proportionate to the success of the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierpont , who let it be lighted under the line of his mustache , and then fired up himself . He asked , along with a puff of smoke , " How well did you know Buster Hogue ? " " Not really well , but well enough . " " Just from talking about his son , I suppose ? " " And one other instance . I tried to buy a few acres from him to add to my own . " " No sale , huh ? " " None . He seemed to think the proposal ridiculous . I thought he was , and so both of us had a laugh . " The doctor tapped a little ash off his cigar , being careful to see that it hit an ashtray . " Even so , afterward he came to you about Simon ? " " Yes . Afterward . But why these questions , Sheriff ? " Charleston waved one hand , indicating the questions were pointless . " Just trying to get a line on Hogue . You have n't told me just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I tend away from surface opinions . He was never a patient of mine . " " But I did n't suggest a professional judgment . Make it lay , clerical , secular , whatever . " Dr. Pierpont weighed his answer . " I suppose I could say he struck me as rather arrogant . I can well imagine he made enemies . But men of means often assume the mantle of superiority . " " Is n't that the truth , " Charleston said . " Unhappily I encounter a good many of them in my practice . Any psychiatrist does . " " And any man without money who runs up against money . " " Yes . " The doctor sipped and continued gravely , " Wealth . The arrogance it creates , and the power it bestows . " He blew out a brief breath at the thought . Charleston put in mildly , " In the wrong hands , you mean , Doctor ? " " Where so much of it is . Wealth , and consequently position and influence . Consequently a circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Direct cause and effect ? " Charleston added . " You answer your own question , Sheriff . " Of a sudden Dr. Pierpont , who had looked dead serious an instant before , relaxed and smiled for the first time . " I 've been talking pointlessly , maundering really , far from my field of competence . Forgive me . " " I was agreeing . " And so , I thought , was I. Wealth in the wrong hands , in the hands of the solely greedy , and with it the influence that money exerted . I could cite a few samples myself  | and felt like saying thanks to the doctor for enforcing my young and hesitant judgments . Charleston pointed toward the glasses , not speaking , and I got up for more drinks . " Professor Powell Hawthorne seems quite different , " Charleston was saying . " You 've met him , I 'm sure . " " Oh , yes . I tried to buy land from him , too , unsuccessfully . " " And what , if you 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Pierpont formulated his answer , I brought in the drinks and sat down . " First impressions are so often wrong , but , frankly , I found him a little too lofty , too precious , for my taste . Not arrogant , though , unless a certain affectation is arrogance . " So , it dodged in my head , the doctor felt as I did , though his language was better . Professor Hawthorne was too fine-haired even if he was the father of Geet . I gathered the interview was closing when Charleston asked , " Are you going on up to your place tonight ? " " Heavens , no , " Dr. Pierpont replied . " Today is , let me see , Wednesday . I have a full day at the office tomorrow and even today had to crowd myself to drive up to see you now . " I appreciate it . I do n't imagine you have leisure enough to enjoy your place to the full ? " " Not nearly . Only about once a month . Oh , occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the day of the picnic , though I had no advance notice of it , being more or less an outsider . " Now that he was off the professional reservation , now  | that whiskey had warmed him , the doctor was being more fluent . " Later , soon I vow , I 'll make more time for myself . I have plans , Sheriff , plans for something considerably more than a mere cabin . And somehow I11 add to my acreage . You must come to see me then . " " I 'll be happy to , " Charleston replied . " Will you have another drink , Doctor ? " Dr. Pierpont looked at his wrist watch . " Thanks , no . Time 's up . I must get back to the city . " He rose from his chair , as we did from ours , and shook hands with both of us . He had a good grip and looked a man in the eye ? which recommended him to me . As he closed the door , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . " The sheriff came back to his chair , slumped in it and asked , " Well , Jase ? " I had gone to the front window and was looking out and down . " He struck me as all right . Scrupulous about Simon Hogue . And about wealth , I was with him . " " Smart man , " Charleston said . " Hey , " I told him , still with my face to the window , " he 's sure got a flashy car . Foreign job , I bet . " " So ? " I turned toward him . " You did n't tell him about the three-oh-three casing . " " Sometimes damn if I do n't seem to forget ? which is just as well , I reckon . Anyhow , does n't matter . " Charleston grinned a tired grin . " See you tomorrow , Jase . " I took the hint .  | THURSDAY , A wek since Buster Hogue had been potted , and no arrests yet and no likely ones without evidence we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I entered the office . He hated it , as I knew , and he looked out of place at a desk with a clutter of pages to be read , signed and answered . A man like him , with a face written on by wind and sun and a body shaped by the outdoors , belonged in the open . Later on , he said , he would give some dictation to Jody Lester , a stenographer the office shared with that of the county clerk . And he 'd better stick around , he told me , to deliver a fugitive to an officer from the eastern part of the state . The prisoner , collared by Halvor Amussen , was wanted for storehouse breaking , check forging , car theft and a few other little things abhorred by the law and was to be returned to the scene of his crimes . Still later , Charleston went on , he was going to Buster Hogue 's funeral , set for two o'clock at the Methodist church . So there was no work for me . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers aside and leaned  | back . Jimmy Conner came in from the jail at about the same time . " Well , boys , " Charleston asked , " any answers today ? " " About who killed Buster Hogue ? " " About anything . People want answers , Jase , certainsure answers , of which there ai n't so many in stock . " Jimmy said , " There 's a lot of questions never been answered . Like why roses smell sweetest when well fed with shit . " " Do n't strain yourself , Jimmy . That 's what the little hen said to the big hen when the big hen bragged that her eggs brought a nickel more on the dozen . Was n't worth the wear and tear . " " The wear and tear in the Hogue case is getting the evidence , " I put in . " What we know all points one way . " Charleston lighted a cigar and leaned farther back . " Does it , Jase ? Maybe . I do n't know . But answers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my old home down south of here , and a drummer , making his first visit , came to the place on a train . When he got off at the station , he saw the settlement was a half-mile away , and no means of getting there but by walkin ' . " The sheriff drew on his cigar as if giving us time to get the picture . " Well , the drummer looked at the long hike he 'd have to take , and he looked at his heavy sample case , and he looked at his feet . " It happened old Gary Watkins was Mafin ' on the platform , which was his habit , and the drummer asked him , Why did they build the station so far from the town ? ' " I du n no , ' Gary says , taking his pipe out of his mouth . I du n no , unless they wanted it close to the tracks . '  | Jimmy laughed , along with me , and said , " I do n't see where that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Charleston told us , and blew out a thoughtful plume of smoke . " Nowhere , maybe , except away from wrong-put questions and smart-ass answers . " I felt perhaps he had gigged me for being sure Simp Hogue had knocked off his father , but I did n't say anything . I took my baseball and wandered downtown , wishing Terry was on hand to play catch with . He was with a crew fighting a forest fire that laid a low haze over the mountains . Felix Underwood came out of his parlors , powdered and dressed for the Hogue ceremony . He was the coroner and had spoken against the idea of an inquest , saying , " Hell , he got shot , did n't he ? By a person or persons unknown ? How you going to improve on what 's plain on its face ? " I went home and made a few throws at the barn door , not putting much heart into them . Anyway , my arm felt good , good enough for the home game on Sunday . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the funeral . I begged off from going to it , not because I did n't like Hogue but because the preacher sure as hell would commend his soul to heaven and take a long time in presenting credentials . Reverend Hauser , having the ear of God , believed in chewing it to a frazzle . I wandered down to Main Street . There was n't many people about , and those that were were mostly dressed sober , as was fitting when a good citizen was to be laid down for good . But Dippy Ferguson had n't heard about the funeral and wore his shirt open under a jacket that  | would have stampeded a blind horse . Under his arm he carried an old , crush-type folder that held order blanks or samples or exhibits of whatever he chanced to be selling . Dippy was a wandering salesman who visited our town only once in a while . I had known him to sell , or try to sell , door to door , combination glass cutters and knife sharpeners , extracts , custom suits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugstore . Right now his line was magazines and newspapers or , rather , subscriptions to them . He did n't do badly , not with the low-priced stuff , for people believed that hard work deserved a reward , no matter the worker 's mental equipment . Say what you would , that Dippy was a sure-enough hustler . What they did n't know ? the older ones who bought his glass cutters and extracts ? was that Dippy 's stock included pictures and picture magazines that he drooled over as he showed them secretly to drooling teen-agers . Dippy did n't smoke , drink , gamble or even swear , people said , ignorant of Dippy 's devotion to the remaining pursuit . " A man 's got to keep up with the times , kid , " he told me when I met him in front of the bank , which , like most places in town , had closed down for the funeral . Because he spit a fine spray when making his spiel , I took a step back . " Christ , yes , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' everywhere every day . " I allowed that was true . " Any magazine you want , I can subscribe you to it . Cheap , too . And papers , big-city papers , from Chicago  | to Spokane . Yes , sir , a man 's got to keep up with the times . " " Yeah , " I answered . " So why did n't you hear about Buster Hogue 's funeral ? " Dippy scratched his head and looked up and down the empty street . " So that 's it , " he said . " He bought some stuff from me once . And they 're layin ' him away , eh ? " " It seemed best . He 's dead . " " Sure , I see , " Dippy answered . " Bad day for me , then . But there 'll be some folks stayin ' home . Now , kid , maybe you ai n't interested yet in current events , but you sure God will perk up when I show you some pictures I got and some samples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and men , havin ' their fun . Me'n ' you will go off somewheres private and have a look . " Somehow Geet Hawthorne came to my mind , and I felt unworthy , and I answered , " No , dammit ! Keep your damn dirty pictures . " I left him looking puzzled but undefeated . After all , everybody had to keep up with the times , public and private . I kept up with the times by going to the post office , looking in our empty box and lazing on home . I worked then on my Buster Hogue murder report , which I had sneaked out of the office , and had a fidgety go at The Moonstone , which the sheriff had lent me . It struck me , after I had read twenty-five pages or so , that maybe old Mrs. Jenkins wanted another chicken dispatched for the pot . Probably she had n't gone to the funeral , and it would n't hurt to ask the old girl . Dippy Ferguson was there before me , and I paused  | outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door . I could n't quite hear what was being said until Mrs. Jenkins lifted her cracked voice in song . Then I could hear all right . So could anybody if he 'd happened to be within crow call . What she sang was her answer , off-key to some tune that had popped into her head . " No , I do n't want your paper . " Dippy was equal to the occasion . To a melody of his own , faster in beat than her bit , he sang back , " Oh , yes , you want to know the news . " He sang a pretty fair tenor , though , I imagined , quite spitty . That opened the ball , or should I say opera ? Delighted at the presence of a fellow singer , Mrs. Jenkins put more spirit into her next selection . Pass the good , pass the good , With a will , with a will , Just a word or smile or song . Be it ever so small Do n't keep it all . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dippy would put on that sentiment , and he did n't disappoint me . In stronger voice , to the tune of " In the Good Old Summertime , " he answered , gesturing appropriately : The boy he climbed the fire escape And got there just in time To see her tootsie-wootsie In the good old summertime .  | Mrs. Jenkins disappeared inside . When she came back , she had an old horse pistol in her hand , which shook with the weight of it . The pistol went off , and so did Dippy . He cleared the gate near me by about five feet and was gone like an antelope , leaving as spoor a scattering of papers . I gave Mrs. Jenkins what I thought was time enough to cool off , but when I knocked at the door and it opened , she still held the pistol . " Mrs. Jenkins , " I said . " It 's just me . Jase . You know . Jason Beard . " There was n't a flicker of recognition in the old face . She appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lay not wait , 0 wicked man , against the dwelling of the righteous . " " In its wanderings the cannon kept picking me up , and I ducked and ran . The sheriff had returned from the graveyard . I told him my story , all of it , as fast as I could . He had to laugh , but his laugh was rueful , and he got right to business . " Jimmy , " he called , and Jimmy appeared . " Your wife working ? " " Not now . Last patient got well . " " Tell her I 'll need her , beginning tonight . " Charleston and I got in the Special and drove to Mrs. Jenkins ' house . He knocked at the door . Mrs. Jenkins answered the knock , all smiles . " Well , Sheriff Charleston and Jase . Come in , both of you . " As soon as we entered , I smelled something burning and without asking leave hurried to the kitchen . A pot had boiled dry . Whatever had been in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to melt . I found a hot pad , put the pot in the sink and turned off the gas . " You 'll have to excuse me , Mrs. Jenkins , " I said on returning . " A pot had burned dry . I turned off the gas . " " Oh , did you ? " she answered . Charleston spoke in his blandest voice . " I understand , Mrs. Jenkins , that a man has been molesting you . " " Was he ? " The old eyes looked at Charleston for confirmation . " I guess so , then . " " So tonight ? and I hope you agree ? I want Mrs. Jimmy Conner to be here . She knows how to deal with bad actors . " " I see , " she answered . " I suppose there 's no one in the spare room , last I heard , anyway . " " You can put Mrs. Conner up , then ? " " Why , I imagine . Mr. Jenkins is away , you know . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back later with Mrs. Conner . " I spotted the pistol at the same time the sheriff did . It lay , plain enough , on a chest in the hall . The sheriff was ahead of me on the way out , and Mrs. Jenkins behind , and I screened him from her sight for the moment it took him to push the thing in his pocket . There were no laughs in either of us as we drove back to the office . All Charleston said was , " lase , old age is a cruel thing . It lays waste body and mind , one or the other or both . The last of life for which the first was made . ' Shit ! "  | EXCEPT THAT THE TIME was morning and the date nine days later , the scene was something like the opener , for charging into the office came Loose Lip Lancaster , mouth open , to report a murder . I had been sitting in the sheriff 's office , listening to him on the phone as he made arrangements for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Todd was n't holding court at the time , either in our town or elsewhere in his jurisdiction and was reluctant , I gathered , to schedule a hearing . " I 'm damn sorry , too , judge , " Charleston was saying , " but the county ca n't act or afford to act as permanent custodian . " Judge Todd , I knew , was n't balking from laziness . He just hated the prospect . A soft-spoken man , not so lately from Kentucky , he had too much tolerance to be on the bench . Which accounted for his poor record on reversals by the Court of Appeals and his long popularity with the voters . " I know , Judge , " Charleston answered to another objection . " I know she 's a fine woman ? or was . But the fact is she ca n't be left to live alone any longer . What ?  | You do n't have to ask me that . Of course she does n't have enough money to employ someone to watch out for her , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheriff said , " Thank you , Judge Todd . Four o'clock today , " and it was right then that Lancaster barged in . " Be goddam , Sheriff ! " he was crying as he opened the door . " Be goddam , another killin ' on top of one you ai n't solved ! " " Slow down , Loose . Who ? " " Ben Day . That 's who . Shot dead . I seen him . " Lancaster perched on the edge of a chair like a bird about to take off . " We got a crime wave . " " Where ? When ? " The sheriff , now standing , rapped out the questions . " On his own place , maybe two hundred yards from his mailbox . When ? I seen him when I was comin ' in . There was kind of a low-lyin ' fog , and me , on my way to town , thought it was a downed critter at first . So I pulled up and went for a look . Deader'n hell . Ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife ? Does she know ? " " Tell her ? Christ , no . You think I was goin ' to the house and blab out , Sorry , ma'am , but your man has been kilt ' ? " " Could n't she see him ? " " Nope . The house , you 'll recollect , sets maybe half a mile from the road where the mailbox is at . There 's a hump , a knoll , between house and box , and he was lyin ' yon side of it from the house . Coughed his life blood out all around . Anyone but me might not have spotted him on account of the fog . " " You 're a genius , " Charleston said . " All right . You 'll  | ride with me . I 'll rout out Felix Underwood first . " He took hold of the phone . " lase , round up Old Doc Yak and drive out with him . " " What you want with a doctor ? " Lancaster broke in . " I done told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So was Buster Hogue according to you . " Before he got his number , Charleston shouted , " Halvor ! Halvor ! " Halvor showed up from the back , where he had probably been playing pinochle with a drying-up drunk who had the run of the jail . " Felix , " Charleston said to the phone . " Hold on a minute . Halvor , take charge here ! Jase , move ! Now Felix ... " It was n't always easy to find Old Doc Yak . I went from his office to the Commercial Cafe to the Bar Star , asking questions , and then from one patient to a second . I found him in one of Duke Appleby 's bedrooms , where he was prescribing pills for one of Appleby 's kids who had tonsillitis . He shed his bedside manner when I told him the news . Riding with Doc Yak was like sledding hell-bent through a field of boulders . While on the highway we got along fairly well , though the doc seemed to think the center line was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists who took to the ditch . But once off the pavement we bounced , thumped and careened . I doubt that Doc Yak missed one promising rock . At any rate I gave him a grade of 90 per cent , which amounted to a solid A in assault .  | The old automobile answered to the punishment with rattles , thumps and groans but somehow held together , and , no doubt in appreciation , Doc Yak said , loud above the clatter , " One thing about old machines , they have good stuff in them . " " Bound to , " I answered . " Yep , " he went on as the right rear wheel churned its way up and out of a soft shoulder , " and they hang to the road , these old cars do . " I said I was glad and I was , for the shoulder overhung a ten-foot-deep borrow pit . I had thought we were going to roll there and have to be taken out , mangled , with torches . There was one speed for Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throttle ? too fast if a cylinder or two had n't been missing . Even so , we made time . In spite of our late start I could see dust rising at two points ahead of us and knew Felix and the sheriff were n't too far in advance . Doc wheeled into the lane to the scratch of gravel and the squeal of tires and , bag in hand , jumped out of the car before it quit moving . I yanked the brake on . Charleston and Felix Underwood and Lancaster and Bodie Dunn , who helped Felix occasionally , were standing and looking down at what was left of Ben Day . The Special was parked close by and so was the hearse , its end opened and left waiting for stuffing like a dressed turkey . " Did n't I tell you ? " Lancaster was saying . " Think I 'm so dumb I ca n't tell a goner ? " I edged up while Doc bent to examine the body . They  | say some people look better dead than alive . Ben Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off any mark of civility , leaving just orneriness . There was blood on his chin and some on his hands and a sopping of blood on his work shirt . He had on an open leather jacket , faded jeans and tennis shoes and wore a holstered and belted sixshooter . Doc laid open the jacket and shirt and skinned up the undershirt so 's to Iook at the chest . There was what looked like a bullet hole rather low on the right side but no blood to speak of . Doc fumbled in his bag , extracted his stethoscope as if out of habit and pitched it back in to the shake of his head . " Any fool can see he 's dead , " he said . " Dead some time . " " How long , Doc ? " Charleston asked . " God knows . Or the devil . Six , eight hours at a guess . Midnight maybe . I 'm no laboratory , you know . " The sheriff said , " Thanks . " Doc turned the body over and peeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . No mark of exit . " Charleston nodded , saying , " So ? " " See for yourself . " " I do . " " Lung punctured and maybe the liver , " Doc Yak went on . " That 's a guess again . No use making sure here and now . Charleston said , " Felix , you want to break the news to Mrs. Day ? " " You 'd think , by God , she 'd have showed up . What does it take , a circus parade ? Not that I mind , though . " I figured Felix did n't . He was used to that kind of  | thing and could shed tears of sympathy while selling a thousand-dollar casket . " Tell her I 'll want to see her , " Charleston said as Felix set out . Doc Yak fastened his bag and stood up . " That 's all for me now , I suppose . " " Stick around if you can , " Charleston told him . " Maybe Mrs. Day or someone will want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd rather he did n't leave now . " Doc Yak gave an all-right , and the sheriff stooped over and went through Day 's pockets . They did n't yield anything except matches and cigarettes . He examined the revolver and found it full loaded . Charleston began nosing back toward the mailbox . There were splotches of blood here and there , and here and there tennis-shoe footprints between the tire tracks . He examined them as we went along and after a while said , " This is the way he came back from the mailbox , not the way he went to it . " I had been too dumb to mark that the footprints all pointed one way , toward the house in the rear of us . The tin mailbox was open . Around it were drippings of blood and a place where the grass had been flattened as if a deer had lain there . " Here 's where he got it , " the sheriff said . " Knocked him down , bullet or shock , and it was a time before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ile looked in the mailbox . It was empty . The road was bordered here by low growth ? buckbrush , white sweet clover , and the drooping stems of wild gaillardias and  | sunflowers . In it , maybe forty feet or less from the box , we came on another place where a deer might have lain . But I knew , without being told , that a man with a gun had screened himself there . We cast around for a shell casing without finding one . It was no wonder . An empty shell , ejected , could have nestled beyond sight in the growth . Charleston went back to the box , studied the field near and far and struck out away from the graveled lane . I was n't a tracker , as he obviously was , but I could make out now and then the marks of passage in the stiff , yellowed grass . The trail meandered , from ground swell to swell and from one clump of cinquefoil to another ; and my imagination pictured Day , seeking cover in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box and all the same getting bushwhacked when he got there . Got there for what ? And got it for what ? " I 've seen enough , " the sheriff said , and led the way back to the party . Ben Day 's body had been stuffed in the hearse and the end of the hearse closed up . Felix was talking to Mrs. Day . Behind her a piece , as if planted there by her order , were the Days ' two ratty boys , ages eight and ten maybe . " I think it best , Mrs. Day , if you do n't view the body now , " Felix was saying . " That 's why I have moved it . Later " ? he gave her a small professional wave ? " of course . " Mrs. Day was n't carrying on . She had the tired , washed look of a woman to whom everything had happened , so  | what was another item ? She replied to Felix , " That 's good enough . " " I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I hope you will feel like answering a few questions . " She answered , " I do n't know nothin ' . " " Did you know your husband left the house last night or early this morning ? Did you hear him leave ? " " I do n't pay no attention . He comes and he goes . " " And did n't you miss him this morning ? " She said the one word , " Him ! " with such a bleak bitterness that I wished the sheriff would n't go on . " Did you hear a shot or shots ? " " Someone always shootin ' around here . If it ai n't jackrabbits it 's deer , in season or out . I do n't pay no attention . " " To your knowledge did anyone wish your husband dead ? " " To my knowledge , yes , sir . I ca n't count ' ern . " " Not a particular one ? " " Buster Hogue , but I do n't guess he took a gun to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It seems a little strange you did n't come down from the house earlier . You must have seen us drive in and pull up . " " I seen you . So what ? I ai n't curious like a cat . " " Do you mind if I come to the house , just to look at the guns your husband had ? " " Look all you want . " " Thank you . In the meantime Mr. Underwood will take the body to town . "  | anytime , anywhere ? not to her . The others had stood around listening . Now Felix and Bodie Dunn started for the hearse . The sheriff took me aside a step or so . " You want to ride back with Doc Yak ? " " Not unless you want me dead in the hearse alongside Ben Day . " He gave his small , knowing smile . " I 'll have Loose Lip ride with Doc . The trip will add to his repertoire . " And so it was arranged . We trailed up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick search of the place . Apparently the only firearms Day had , besides his revolver which Charleston kept , were a . zz repeater and an old .30-06 , which was the gun for elk and bear . Neither had been fired in some time . As we left , Charleston said , " Thank you , Mrs. Day , and my sympathy . I may want to talk to you later . " She nodded her life-weary head . On the trip back to town with the sheriff I said , " It 's damn funny . " " What 's funny ? " " Loose Lancaster . How come he 's Johnny-on-the-spot all the time ? How come he knew Day died from a bul-let ? " Charleston answered , " Genius , " and was silent for a time . " Jase , " he asked then , " some of it 's pretty plain , is n't it ? Tennis shoes included . " " Tennis shoes ? " " It ai n't doin ' no good here . " In her words , in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any good ,  | " Sneakers , Jase , to back up other evidence . " It dodged in my mind as he spoke that I never had seen Day in anything other than cowpuncher boots . Evidence or not , the sheriff was n't satisfied . His face as he drove had a look of troubled preoccupation , the weather lines etched at the sides of his mouth . " I do n't know what I could have done , but I should have foreseen this . " " Foreseen what ? " " Day 's getting shot . Damn it , a man who ca n't spot a pair in an open hand has no business in the game . "  | FELIX WITH HIS TELLTALE HEARSE and Igoe Yak with his mouthy passenger were sure to have alerted the town before Charleston and I arrived . The time was early afternoon , and the weather was hotter than the pistol the sheriff did n't carry . He was n't as faithful to his firearm as I was to my baseball . " We can find out who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said as we approached the fringe of the town . I answered , " Oh ? " " Yeah . " His teeth shone white as he glanced at me with a smile that had little fun in it . " Jesus save me ! Comin ' to the office will be more than three wise men who 've seen the star . More'n that where men drink or feed . And those that see not will want me to tell ' em what is n't plain to my eye . We could run out to the graveyard and have some peace , I reckon , but no nourishment with it . " " Why not go to my house ? " I asked . " It will be quiet there , and my mom will scrape up something to eat . " " I was n't hinting . Why for should she ? " " For one sure thing , she 'll be anxious about me . She is if I do n't report pretty often . And she 's probably heard  | about the shooting to boot , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All I want is to fight shy of my constituents for a spell . " I knew I would n't have to mention food , not to my mother . We parked by the side of the house , where some old cottonwoods cast a shade while they dropped the last of their cotton . I led the way to the back door and yelled , " Mother , " though it turned out I did n't have to . She was in the kitchen . " lase , " she said , " I 'm so glad to see you , to know you 're safe . Mabel Main called to tell me why and where you 'd gone . It 's so terrible . Oh , good afternoon , Mr. Charleston , " she went on , catching sight of him hanging back from the doorway . " Please come in . It 's so hot . I 've made a pitcher of iced tea . " " I 'm dodging my supporters , but I do n't want to intrude , " the sheriff answered , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed to me that the edges of his hair had grown more silver in the last few days . Except that he was too thin of body and somewhat too young , he should have been in the Senate , where impressive older men guided the national destiny . " Oh , bother your intrusion ! " Mother said . " And I bet you 're both hungry . I 'll make sandwiches and bring in the tea . You two go in the living room . It 's cooler there . " After we had sat down , I said , just to pass the time , " The longer it goes on , the more suspects we have , it seems to me. "  | " And for sure the more bodies . " " That Mrs. Day now . She was awful indifferent . No grief at all . " The sheriff nodded , more as if in thought than in agreement with such suspicion . " I reckon she 's had good cause to kill him many a time . Does n't prove she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " With Buster Hogue ? " " Right . Brooded by the same hen , I figure . But more suspects ? Yeah , Jase . Or fewer . " We were quiet until Mother came in with iced tea , cold beef sandwiches and leftover lemon pie . Charleston got up when she appeared . His good manners gave me a little pain , but not so with Mother . She sat down with her sewing while we ate , but I could tell her mind was n't on mending . Apparently Charleston could , too , for he said , " It was outright murder , Mrs. Beard . More than that we hardly know . " " And old Mrs. Jenkins ? " she said in her gentle voice . " lase told me . That will be a kind of putting to death , too , if she is committed . " " I dare to hope not , " Charleston answered . His tone held regret but also a hard recognition of fact that came counter to Mother 's softness . " It 's possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case we must act . " " It 's cruel all the same . " " It 's the years that are cruel , not society . " " But society , authority , will take what the years have left . " " Mrs. Beard " ? the sheriff 's voice had gone stern ?  | " do you realize she might have killed your son yester-day ? " Mother 's startled gaze fixed on me . " What ? Killed you , Jase ? " " It 's true , " Charleston persisted . " She held a gun on him . Jase did n't tell you . " Mother asked , " Did she , son ? " They had made me uncomfortable , this man that I admired and the mother I loved , by coming so close to dispute . " She was just confused , " I answered . " It was nothing to get you alarmed about . And the hearing is nothing , nothing , I mean , compared to two murders . Mr. Charleston should be free to center on them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jackof-all-trades . Which reminds me . I must serve the citation on Mrs. Jenkins . The county attorney has prepared the petition . " We had finished eating , and he stood up . Before he thanked Mother , he carried his dishes into the kitchen . I followed suit , the example having been set . That act of the sheriff 's was enough to melt any pique in my mother . I was sure Charleston would go to the office after serving the citation on Mrs. Jenkins even if he had to listen to a lot of worthless theories about Day 's murder , so I made some excuse to my mother and went to the courthouse after fiddling around for a while . No one was in the office except Charleston and old Jimmy , who was n't doing anything but drawing his pay . Charleston was on the phone , apparently waiting for someone to answer . He waved me toward the extension ,  | saying , " I want you to be able to report to your mother that I tried . " " Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , Doctor Pierpont . Sheriff Charleston here . I 'm glad I could find you . " " Yes ? " " I called on the bare chance you could help us . We have a hearing this afternoon , a case of senile incompetence ? or insanity as the law has it ? a hearing on a citation for commitment . I dislike to press it . " " Naturally . " " The defendant is , or has been , an excellent lady . I hate to see her carted off to the asylum , and I am wondering whether you could examine her and , perhaps , by your therapy , enable her to continue her life here ? The county would pay you . " " How old is she ? " " I do n't know . Seventy-odd , I would guess . Physically spry . " The doctor 's voice was decisive . " It would be a waste of my time and the county 's money , Sheriff . " " No possible help ? " " In a controlled environment , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . There is little we can do about the problems of aging . " " I see . Thank you , Doctor . Oh , by the way , have you heard there 's been another murder in the neighborhood of the canyon ? " " No ! Who this time ? " " Day . Ben Day . "  | " Do I know him ? Yes , I think , vaguely , by hearsay . And was n't he at that wretched picnic ? " " He was . We found him dead inside his own field , not so far from his mailbox . " " And you 're sure he was murdered ? " " No doubt about it on first examination . " " I do n't envy you your job , Sheriff . No clues yet , T suppose . Two shootings and no clues . " " None worth a damn . " " Too bad . I can only wish you good luck . " " I 'll need it . Thanks . But back to this case of senility . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Right . " He added , " Sorry . " Charleston said thanks again , hung up and turned to me . " Last gasp , and it turned out short and sweet . Do n't forget to tell your mother , Jase . " As I was saying I would n't , the door opened and Guy Jamison came in , dressed like the dude 's idea of the master of the outdoors . " Now I have maybe a little clue , Chick , " he said . The phone rang , and Charleston told Jimmy , " Get that damn phone in the other office , will you , Jim ? Anything important , goose me . Go ahead , Guy . " " I was coming from the city last night with a car full of dudes . Late-ish . Going back today for some more . Anyhow , along about Ben Day 's place I passed a strange car . " He waited until Charleston answered , " There 's considerable traffic up there . " " Not at that hour , close to midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day 's land runs along the road for a mile ,  | but there 's a place on the road where the shoulder has given away , making a kind of tight squeeze . That 's where we passed . " " Any idea of the make of the car , license number , driver ? " " It was too dark for a bat , Chick , and I had to watch the road so 's not to hit him or fall in the ditch , and the dudes were jabbering , but I got the idea , the bare idea , the car was n't local . " " Did you get a glimpse of the driver ? " " Glimpse is right . I would n't know him from the cue ball . " " But he was n't a neighbor ? " " Hell , Chick , you ought to know a neighbor would have stopped , like I would 've , and said good evening and how 's tricks and all that . This man squeezed by , mum , and went on . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard about Ben Day an hour or so ago . " " All right , Guy . " Charleston got up . " Maybe it will help . We 're much obliged . Now Jase and I are due at court . " Jamison let himself out . The phone had rung a couple of times , and Charleston paused long enough to ask , raising his voice , " Anything important , Jimmy ? " Old Jimmy showed at the connecting door . " Yeah . Some joker says try a Ouija board . " The hearing for Mrs. Jenkins was held in the courtroom , not in chambers , but since it was special and the court not  | in regular session , no one but the involved parties attended , though once or twice the door to the room opened and someone peeked in only to leave . Judge Todd had n't bothered to robe himself . Maybe he thought judicial appearance would rattle old Mrs. Jenkins . Mrs. Jenkins and Mrs. Conner sat in the second row of seats . Mrs. Conner , who was perhaps fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion but still looked like a nurse , I thought guiltily , who could keep in fine fettle three or four babies . The sheriff and I and Doc Yak occupied the first row . Between us and the bench sat Marion Shannon , the court reporter , with his stenotype , and Montgomery Clough , the pip-squeak county attorney , who attended the hearing for reasons never apparent , since the judge himself took over the questioning . The sheriff was the first witness . After he had been sworn and identified himself , Judge Todd said , " As you know , Sheriff Charleston , before the court is a petition to commit Mrs. Jennie Caine Jenkins . " " I noticed he omitted the legal phrase , " for reasons of insanity . " But it would n't have made any difference , I thought . Mrs. Jenkins sat as if lost and unhearing , her wrinkled hands held placid in her lap . The judge was saying , " What can you tell the court , as a matter of fact , in support of the petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Charleston answered . " But it will be supported , Your Honor . And , of course , it is common knowledge that Mrs. Jenkins sings hymns , sings them aloud , on her daily march to the post office . "  | Judge Todd let a little smile crack the solemnity of his face . " You have heard of the First Amendment , Sheriff ? " " And defend it , Your Honor . It is her right to sing if she wants to . I point to it only as an oddity of behavior . " " Yes . Go on . " " Yesterday afternoon , Your Honor , Mr. Jason Beard came to my office to report that Mrs. Jenkins had taken a shot at a man and , later , threatened himself . " " The court will hear from Mr. Beard on that point . " " Yes . Then in company with Mr. Beard I called immediately at the home of Mrs. Jenkins . " " And ? " " She welcomed us . " " And seemed rational enough ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague , with no apparent memory of having shot at or threatened anybody . Also she seemed to think that her husband , dead now for a good many years , was away only temporarily . " By squirming around , I could steal another glance at Mrs. Jenkins . She sat without movement , unheeding , her eyes blank , clouded , lost somewhere in the long roll of her life . The years . They had left only scattered memories , the then time or times , and the rare , cruel grasp of the now . I heard Judge Todd say , " That is the extent of your testimony ? " " Not quite , Your Honor , " Charleston responded . " On the way out of the house I happened to see this revolver . " The sheriff took it out of his pocket , which was insufficient to hide it , stood up and laid it on the bench . " It is an old  | forty-five with an eight-inch barrel , as you see , and it has been recently fired . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down-turned and tired . " Where ? " he asked . " On a chest or table just inside the entrance . " " The victim ? The intended victim ? Where is he ? " " Mr. Beard can tell you about him . We have been unable to locate him . I imagine he is a far piece away . " " Very well , " Judge Todd said . " Stand down , Sheriff Charleston . " I was aware that Doc Yak , seated beside me , had been fidgeting throughout the proceedings . He was nervous by nature and in spite of his pills . Now , as the judge 's eyes rested on me , Doc Yak stood up . " Your Honor , " he said , " may I be heard ? Necessarily I 'm in a hurry . " " You are also in a court of law . " " Yes , Your Honor , but urgencies ? " " Sit down , Doctor . Before the court is an urgency , too , an important matter , a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a case of this kind the court and the medical profession act , so to speak , in concert ? We must both hear the evidence . Then you may speak . Take the stand , Mr. Beard . " Doc Yak sat down as I went forward , but his head had a lift to it as if he might howl at the moon . I went through the business of swearing and identifying myself . " You 're not a deputy in the sheriff 's office ? " Judge Todd asked , knowing very well I was n't . " No , Your Honor , I guess I 'm just a hanger-on . " " But you help out when you can ? "  | I said I did . " You were at the residence of Mrs. Jenkins yesterday afternoon ? " " Twice , sir . The first time I did n't go in because of that horse pistol there . The second time I did , along with Mr. Charleston . " " Tell the court about the first time . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped by the fence . " " Can you identify the said Dippy Ferguson ? " " He was the man at the door . Oh , he 's a door-to-door salesman of one thing and another , and he comes to town once in a while . " " And why were you there , outside Mrs. Jenkins ' house ? " " To chop the head off a chicken , if she wanted me to . " The judge frowned , as if the reason demanded examination . " I often did that for her , " I told him , and added in the cause of justice , " for twenty-five cents . " " She paid you always ? " " She certainly did , Your Honor . Sometimes she got mixed up with the change , but I always straightened it out . " " " I see . Go on . A man had preceded you ? " " Yes . Dippy Ferguson was at the door , trying to sell a magazine or newspaper subscription , as I got it , and Mrs. Jenkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't want your paper ! " " And then ? " " Well , Dippy likes to sing , too , and he has a pretty good voice only he spits , and he did n't get the name Dippy for  | " Nothing , " I said and looked at old Mrs. Jenkins sitting there patiently . " Nothing , except it 's a shame , a damn shame ? " " I know , " the judge broke in . " Step down , Jason . Now , Doctor . " Doc Yak , moving like a bundle of hurried sticks , came forward and sat . I was reminded , during the swearing in , that he was really Gaylord Summerville , M.D. " You do know Mrs. Jenkins , the defendant , Doctor ? " Judge Todd asked . " For forty years . Splendid woman . When she 's at herself . Husband was my patient , too . Dead of cancer . " Doc Yak was rattling off answers as if , unless he hurried , some patient would perish of mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the evidence and your experience with her ? " Doc Yak was n't looking at Mrs. Jenkins or she at him . He said , " I 'm not forced to testify . Breach of professional ethics . " " But you will help the court , Doctor ? You 'll advise ? " " With reluctance . For her sake . Mrs. Jenkins calls me once or twice a week . Often I answer in person . Last time I made a house call ? " " When ? " Doc Yak took a worn little book from his hip pocket and consulted it . " Three o'clock this past Wednesday , July twenty-three . " " Yes . " " She had forgotten she called me . Thought I was the plumber . Could n't tell me what to plumb . "  | Behind me I heard Mrs. Jenkins tell Mrs. Conner , " Faucets . He knows very well it was leaky faucets . " Judge Todd rapped softly with his gavel . He could have heard the sounds but not the words . " So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the court ? " " Senile dementia , " Doc Yak answered as if the words were sour on his tongue . " Brain starved for blood . Nothing to do but commit her . I 'm sorry . " " Thank you , Doctor . You may be excused . " Doc Yak clattered out of the witness box and galloped away . Judge Todd said , " You have heard the evidence , Mrs. Jenkins . You are not represented by counsel , I see , nor is there any need of that in the eyes of this court . The question is : Do you wish to take the stand ? Do you wish to appear in your own defense ? Mrs. Jenkins ? Do you hear me ? Do you want to be heard ? " " Thank you , " Mrs. Jenkins said , coming jerkily to her feet . Her eyes had gone away again , away from the faucets and plumber , into some cataract dimness of dream . " I have enjoyed myself , but I must go now . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found her at last in the person of Mrs. Conner , who had been holding her arm all the time . They left the courtroom . " Sheriff , " Judge Todd said then , " this has been a most irregular proceeding , but it is in accordance with the court 's good judgment , if against its sentiments , that an emergency commitment in this case be issued at once . Central State Hospital has facilities , experts in mental disorders , that we lack here , and it can pass on her competency , in- sanity if you will , with an authority we do n't possess . Court 's adjourned . " Once inside his office the sheriff got rid of Halvor by asking if he would n't go buy some cigars . The girl clerk at the drugstore was a looker , and Halvor strode off . Then Charleston told me , " lase , you 're elected . " " To what , Mr. Charleston ? " " To driving Mrs. Jenkins , along with Mrs. Conner as her attendant , to Central State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy ? two days at least ? because of Mrs. Jenkins ' age and condition . " At the expression on my face he went on , " You know I ca n't go , not with two murders , last one just today . My outside deputy has his hands full there in the oil country . I would n't trust Jimmy to drive so far . " He gave me a small smile . " And I would n't trust Halvor with Mrs. Conner , good woman as she may be . He might die of mammary smother . That leaves you . I 'll fix you and Mrs. Conner up with official letters . " " But there 's a ball game Sunday . " " Yes , Jase , " he answered . " There 's a ball game . " A silence hung between us . I got up and said , " Please do n't solve the murders while I 'm gone . "  | THE CAR I WAS TO DRIVE was a two-year-old Chev , assigned to the sheriff 's office and used mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Charleston preferred his own Special . It could almost have passed for new . Charleston saw to that . Before I left to pick up my passengers , the sheriff gave me a letter in witness of my responsibility and official mission and with it thirty dollars for expenses . Also , he handed over an envelope for Mrs. Conner . It contained , he told me , the commitment papers and a statement identifying the bearer . Two suitcases and an overnight bag were waiting on Mrs. Jenkins ' front porch . I stowed them in the trunk before knocking . Mrs. Conner , looking efficient though bulgy , answered the door . She carried a piece of hand luggage big enough for all Woolworth 's cosmetics . Her other hand pulled Mrs. Jenkins along . Though her stockings did n't match , Mrs. Jenkins was dressed for the ball , the result of joint effort , no doubt . Mrs. Conner locked the door , saying as she did so , " We 'll have a nice ride , Mrs. Jenkins , and people will be so glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | Mrs. Jenkins hung back . " I must be back before sundown . Where 's my purse ? Did you lock the door ? " " Yes . Yes . Everything 's attended to . Here 's your purse in my bag , if you 'd rather carry it . Come on , now . " Mrs. Conner managed to urge Mrs. Jenkins into the back seat , then climbed in herself . It was a nice day all right . The sun , now perhaps two hours awake , shone gently ? which was no promise it would n't blister us later ? and the southwest wind was no more than a breath . What clouds there were were fluffy . East of town , once we were out of the valley and up on the bench , the treeless land flowed away , so level and long it might have been planed by John Bunyan 's carpenter . It was checkered by wheat fields that lapped and ebbed at the sides of the road , answering to the faint breeze . In a week or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a house or a shack , forsaken now because wheat ranchers all lived in town so 's to enjoy daily mail and flush toilets . Scattered cattle grazed or dozed in fields not touched by plows . The wild sweet clover that crowded the pavement gave off a scent . A dust devil played in a patch of summer fallow . I tooled the car toward the end of this flat world , toward the end of the world . The two in back were silent , or spoke too low for my ears , until Mrs. Jenkins began to sing in her old , believing voice Still He comforts mourning hearts , Life and joy and peace imparts . She was to sing that couplet , off and on , until we pulled  | up for the night . When pauses came , Mrs. Conner would say , " Yes , dear . That 's sweet , dear . " After a couple of hours the sun went into business . It invaded the car like a torch , piercing the metal top , blowing in through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spent breath of fever . To open a window was to receive a blast . I thought about the miles to Central State Hospital , which was called central because it was so far off center . My mind went to Geet Hawthorne , standing slim , cool and golden in her shaded retreat . Were her eyes , was her face , on low beam or high ? And then ? such are the wide swings of thought ? I figured I 'd better watch for a gasoline station . Old people had bladder trouble , and , come to think of it , I could use a short leak myself . But when I slowed at sight of a wayside truck stop , Mrs. Jenkins said , " You 're poking , Jase . I 'll never get back . " So I drove on , knowing I could hold it as long as the next man and rating Mrs. Jenkins as a good traveler . An hour later I did stop , at a station in a burning burg called Titus . Mrs. Conner saw her charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , I bought three cans of pop , courtesy of the sheriff 's office , and waited for my passengers . It was n't much help , in that heat , to remind myself that women always took an awful time in the powder room . Was it because they did n't have flexible spouts ? Mrs. Jenkins did n't look refreshed when she and Mrs. Conner came out . She looked worn and removed , as if the present had been washed out of her mind and only the dim shores of remembrance remained . I opened the pop cans and passed them around and got  | the car under way . To my surprise Mrs. Conner reached into her oversized bag and lifted out sandwiches . They were fresh and well-flavored , made of homebaked bread , and it struck me that old Jimmy had a pretty good thing in his wife . After two hundred miles Mrs. Conner said , " I think we 've had enough for today , Jase . Do n't you , Mrs. Jenkins ? " She had to repeat her question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do we get out ? Where 's my purse ? " " It 's in your hand , Mrs. Jenkins . " Mrs. Jenkins looked at her hand to make sure , said , " Oh , " and asked , " What are we doing here ? " " Now do n't you worry . " We were on the edge of Munroe , a fair-sized town , and here was a motel and a sign that read EATS . I pulled up and made arrangements for the night . Mrs. Conner told me , " I think Mrs. Jenkins ought to rest for a while . Then we 'll have supper . " " This is n't home , " Mrs. Jenkins said as her faded eyes looked around . " Where are we ? Oh , yes " ? her gaze had come to her hand ? " I 've found my purse . " Mrs. Conner told her again not to worry . I carried a couple of bags to their double room , saw the ladies inside and went back into the lobby , wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . On TV was a baseball game , Giants versus Dodgers with Perry and Osteen pitching . I wished I had brought my baseball along . The ladies showed up along about half-past five , and we went into the cafe . The special was pot roast , which was  | special because the menu said so . I washed it down with a chocolate shake , thinking good riddance . Before we started eating , Mrs. Jenkins fixed her misty eyes on me and said , " Ask the blessing . " I felt like a fool , there among strangers , but- I muttered the bobtailed grace that my father used when under pressure . Through with the meal , the ladies went at once to their room . I did , too , after tarrying long enough to buy a twoday-old Spokane paper for the sports news . Just before we parted , Mrs. Conner had asked , " What time in the morning , Jase ? " " Six o'clock , I 'd say . A hundred miles to go . With a good start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenkins said , " Now . Please . I want to go back . You see ? " " You need a good night 's rest , " Mrs. Conner told her . " Do n't you worry , dear . " They left me then , the early start being agreed on . We arrived at the hospital about 9:30 the next morning . The drive was made without incident or much conversation except that Mrs. Jenkins had turned over the record , which nevertheless stuck again . She kept singing , sometimes low , sometimes high-quavering , God will take care of you , O'er all the way , Through every day . I hoped to God He would though He had n't . The hospital consisted of a bunch of buildings , all old ,  | some trees and ragged lawns on which a few people were lazing . They were the ones , I supposed , who had the run of the grounds because they did n't know where else to run . I pulled up in front of a building marked ADMISSIONS and let the ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk and headed for the door we had come in , not wanting to witness this final act of commitment , not with Mrs. Jenkins looking so old and so lost . Even her voice had failed her . She just stood , someone waiting , someone not waiting , for nothing . On the wall near the entrance was posted a roster of the hospital 's medical men . M.D. 's followed the names that I noticed , but what took my attention was an item at the bottom of the list that read : ULYSSES PIERPONT , M.D. Consultant in Psychiatry A man stood outside the door , looking official while his eyes roamed over the privileged prisoners . I took him to be a guard and asked , just to make talk , " Doctor Pierpont here today ? " " Once a week . He flies in , usually on Wednesday , " he answered , sizing me up to see whether I was a candidate for his jurisdiction . " You a friend of his ? " " I know him . " " A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sanity . Then he added , as if glad to have someone of sound mind to talk to , " These other doctors , they 're high muckymucks ,  | too high for the likes of us poor personnel unless we got a chugged gut , but Doctor Pierpont now , do n't think he 's not all business but he 's always got a friendly howdy for us and more'n that if the looney load ai n't too heavy . He 's a brain man , you know , what some call a head-shrinker or a skull-tinker . No matter of that , by God , he 's good . More , like I say , not like his brother snot noses , he 's always friendly to us . Treats us like humans . " " I would think so . " " " Which makes him not too goddam popular with what you would call his colleagues . But he do n't care . I guess the sons of bitches do n't rate too high with him . " He stepped away . " That 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gab it . So long . Time for my coffee break . " I moseyed around after he left , trying to fight shy of the inmates , but perhaps five minutes later a man in a full suit , plus tie , tugged at my arm . He might have been one of the doctors . " Good morning , " I said . He answered , " Good morning , " and his eyes studied me . Then , abruptly , he whipped out and open the right side of his suit coat and announced , " Hart , Schaffner and Marx . " " " I see , " I said and beat it away from him . I could talk to old people in a way but to nuts , no way . I made for ADMISSIONS and the comfort of sanity mixed with senility . Mrs. Conner was about to take leave of her charge . " Now , Mrs. Jenkins , " she was saying , " here 's your purse , and there are your bags , and you 'll be all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have to be back before dark . "  | " Yes . I know . " A woman in whites stood near them , ready to take Mrs. Jenkins away , into the dark she had to avoid before it came on . The lady in whites said , with professional , pin-prick sincerity , " You 'll be very happy here , Mrs. Jenkins . We 're so happy to have you . " Mrs. Jenkins turned her gentle , beseeching , confused gaze on me . " Please tell Mr. Jenkins I 've been delayed . " I managed to answer , " Sure , Mrs. Jenkins , " and in weak inspiration added , " And I 'll feed and water your chickens . " Mrs. Conner said , " Here 's your purse . " - oI drove safely enough , going home , but still wheeled . I wanted to see the mountains , to get out of this flatland that dipped just for a couple of drying-up streams and then leveled off into forever . I wanted to put distance between Mrs. Jenkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the murders which , damn it , might have been solved , might be solved any minute , with me unaware and unrecognized . That was what death did to you : it let things go on without your knowledge , assistance or credit . Mrs. Conner , beside me , did n't make talk . We were five or six miles short of that scorched town of Titus , and then it happened . I was driving at about 70 mph , plenty fast for the chuckholed , single-lane road , when a car as long as a Detroit dream squeezed by me , blatting , and cut in too soon after  | overhauling the Chev . Braking , I saw my front fender crumple . The Detroit dream , rubber screeching , wavered and swerved to the right toward the ditch . I hit its right fender with my right front . It slewed around , reversed in direction , and hung on the road 's shoulder . At a - standstill , looking back , I saw it tottering . Then , like a halfwakened horse that decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side in the borrow pit . It did have , if not a driver , someone who had been at the wheel . He got a free door cocked open , climbed up and out and , feet scratching for footholds , mounted the shoulder . He looked big . After one shout Mrs. Conner had gone quiet . I opened my door , slid out and stepped toward the man . He was marching on me . " By God , " he said and kept marching . He was big all right , and he had a face like an open-faced pie , slightly scorched . Close up , he spoke again , his breath smelling like a crowded saloon . " Fine fix you got me in , punk . " Blood was in my head , and , for an answer , I belted him in the belly . The wind went out of him , and he bent over . Bent over , he limped to the side of the road and threw up . He came back , unbent , said , " Good punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lick so sharp I went down . I scrambled up , still full of fight , but he took a backward step and stayed me with a lifted hand , open palm toward me . " That makes us even , " he said . " Now we can negotiate . " " Negotiate , hell ! " From behind me Mrs. Conner said , " I 'm a witness . Remember that . A witness to drunken driving . "  | " Now . Now . Easy , " the man answered . " I 'm not drunk . " He did n't look it or act it , aside from that crazy driving , though his breath still came out of a bottle . His eyes lifted from mine and fixed themselves on something behind me . I did n't fall for that old trick . " Kid , " he said , " trust me , will you ? My fault and all , I own up . Leave it to me , please . " I turned to look then . A state-patrol car had parked behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Officer , " the big man said , " I 'm in the wrong , I admit . I 'm the offender . " The patrolman 's eyes examined the wreckage and returned to the big man . " Let me see your driver 's license . " The big man fumbled out a fat wallet , opened it and held it out at arm 's length , obviously so the patrolman would n't get a sniff of his breath . To me the patrolman said , " Yours . " Mrs. Conner edged in and interrupted . " It 's a wonder you do n't ask if anyone 's hurt . " " The patrolman 's gaze was calm . " Is there ? Does n't appear so . " " No , " Mrs. Conner answered , " but there would have been if it was n't for this boy here , the way he drove when that fool ? " " I 've said I 'm guilty , ma'am . I say it to all of you . No hard feelings , I hope . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have n't got used to its length . After passing this young man , I cut in too quick , not realizing how long was my tail . Stupid but understandable . "  | The patrolman was examining my credentials . " Sheriff Charleston , " he said . " Give him hello from Tom Stevenson . I said I would . " Reckless driving , " the patrolman told the big man , " and not the minimum bond , not with so much property damage . It 's a county car to boot . " " I 'll pay , of course . " The fat wallet made a wave . The patrolman and I stepped out for a look at the Chev . The bumper had a leer to it , and both fenders were bashed in , but that seemed the extent of the damage . " Try the starter , " the law said . I did . The car started . Quietly the patrolman advised me , " We 'll make it enough . Two hundred dollars . " " The big man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seemed glad . " I 'll pay it to this young fellow right now , " he answered , and two hundred dollars in bills came to my hand . " Does that suit you ? " the patrolman asked me . " I guess so . " " I 'll make the bond the minimum then . Twenty-five dollars . " The big man seemed happy to pay that , too . " If you wish to appear in court ? " the patrolman began . " Never mind . Never mind . I wo n't . " " I can have a wrecker sent out , " the patrolman said as he handed the big man his receipt . " Titus is just down the line . "  | " My car will run , I think , once I get the fenders pulled up off the tires , " I said . All of us , except Mrs. Conner , attended to that chore . The big man , on account of his breath , was careful not to heave side by side with the law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good smile , a smile that would have charmed a dyspeptic . " If this young man will just give me a ride into Titus , I can attend to the wrecker . It appears he 's not crowded . " The patrolman asked me , " What about it ? It happens to be convenient to me . " " I guess so . " While the patrolman and I watched , the big man went confidently to his overturned car , gophered into it , and came out with a bag and a briefcase . I opened the trunk for them . The patrolman tucked his book under his arm , strode to the state car and drove around us . As he passed , he slowed to tell the big man , " No funny business . " There would n't be any anyhow , I felt sure , but all the same it reassured me , when the big man ushered Mrs. Conner into the back seat , to see that she had a fist-sized rock in her hand . He got in with me , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we started to roll , " that you have something to do with the law ? " " Something . " " Good , but there 's no future in it . I always say get into sales . " I thought of Dippy Ferguson and answered , " Some do n't do so hot . "  | " Chicken-coop stuff . Door to door . Big deals I 'm talking about . I 've made fortunes for many a man and have n't done so bad for myself . " Easy money seemed to drip from his mouth . " But that 's not here or there . Where you bound , son ? " I had graduated from punk . " Midbury . " " Now that 's a coincidence . Same here . Do n't want to put you out , but how about taking me all the way ? " Because we had entered Titus and a garage just ahead advertised a wrecking service , I did n't ask , not then , what was his hurry . I just answered , " I guess so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked for a couple of minutes . Mrs. Conner was cradling her rock , ready to reduce him to a patient . He came out and said , " All set , " and resumed the seat beside me . " These hick nut-and-bolt boys know more than the big-time Jesse Jameses . " On the road again I did ask him , " What 's your hurry ? " " Hurry , " he said . " Yep . Burry . That was the cause of our accident . " " You were damn slow to admit it . " He laughed what seemed an honest laugh . " My boy , a position , clearly stated and boldly maintained ? that 's the secret of success in law , politics , salesmanship and whatever . " " It was n't working so well with me . " " Ah , but it might have . The patrolman messed me up . " He chuckled , remembering . " I 'm insured to the limit . " " You have n't told me yet what was your hurry and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boozy sigh . " You happen to know one Ben Day ? " " He 's dead . " " So I heard yesterday . My name 's Michael , Mike for short , Day . He 's my brother . " " Sorry . " " My brother , and he owes me money to boot . I set him up in business , made the down payment on that ranch of his . " " Him ? " " Age of innocence , " he answered as if his innocence was long gone . " Eight years ago , and , God rest his deadbeat soul , never a payment made and the note not renewed . " " Too late now , so what 's the hurry ? " He was silent for a minute , perhaps debating how much to tell . " Big mix-up , " he answered then . " That damn note ? I got it in my pocket ? the statute of limitations ran out the very day he got croaked . You get the picture ? " " Part of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim quick . If only my damn brother had signed a renewal ! " " Maybe his will takes care of that . " " Will ! Ben make a will ? Nuts . There 'll be an administrator appointed by court . " " That would be his wife , his widow , would n't it ? " " Ha , " he said . " Sweet Marcy Belle . " He leaned over and whispered in my ear , his breath still pretty rank , " She could n't read shit ' if it was spelled out in cow dabs . " " So ? " " That 's it . So ? "  | He fell silent then , as if for his part the subject was ended . That suited me . I wheeled the quiet miles , thinking of one thing and another , including crumpled fenders , a brother interested in money to the exclusion of murder and my report to the sheriff . Foxy was the name for the Days , foxy tough for the dead one , plain foxy for Mike . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball game I 'd missed and Mrs. Jenkins ' chickens . The sun had started its slant to the west , and the heat of it burned in the car . I blinked against the shine , driving steady except for a sandwich-and-drink stop . I could begin to see the mountains , shapes of blue mist straight ahead . We would be home , I figured , somewhere around nine o'clock . The miles went by , marked by the idle bits of talk , and a fire lit itself in the west , and by and by we dropped down from the bench to the valley , not soon enough , quite , to be home before dark . " Just let me off anywhere , " Mike Day said . " I 'll make out . " I left him and his bag and his briefcase in front of the Jackson Hotel . Before he took leave , he thanked me and Mrs. Conner warmly , though it would have taken more than warm thanks to thaw her . Then I drove her to her house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per diem . She dropped her rock by the sidewalk . After I parked the beat-up car in the rear of the courthouse , I made for the sheriff 's office , from which shone the only light in the building . Halvor was seated in the  | sheriff 's chair with his feet on the desk and his hands on a picture magazine . He said , " Hello , Sherlock . " " Hello yourself . Know where I can find Mr. Charles-ton ? " " Yep . Gone to the city . Gone to the city on business is what he said . " Halvor grinned . " That 's what he said , but I just happened to notice , lookin ' out the window , that he had a dame with him . " " Who ? " " Search me , but she was a dish , a real honest-to-God dish . " I left . I would report tomorrow , after feeding Mrs. Jenkins ' damn chickens .  | IT WAS NOON THE NEXT DAY before I got up , a fact that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I slept through the alarm . She answered to my complaint by saying a growing boy needed his sleep , especially after a hard day , and a lamb chop and a couple of eggs would promote health and soothe temper . The mention of eggs was a reminder , so I asked her to hold up while I saw to Mrs. Jenkins ' chickens , which were just a hop-skip away and probably were n't hopping or skipping , times being so hard . At this noon hour the sheriff 's office could wait . The chickens were all right , or anyhow live enough to appreciate feed and water . It was five minutes past one when I walked into the sheriff 's office . Jimmy Collins motioned toward the littleused room that was private when the door was closed . " He 's waitin ' , " he said , " and he 's done seen the wreck you dragged in . Like a kid , you ran into a daydream , I reckon . " Instead of answering , I knocked at the door , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't alone . In one of the four chairs near the desk  | sat a stringy character he introduced as Gus Gewald , who greeted me shortly in a voice that put me in mind of a hacksaw on the push . " Mr. Gewald is a state criminal investigator , " Charleston said , " and he 's here to help us unravel our mystery . " He spoke in a tone of easy tolerance , which still had a barb in it like the point of a fishhook inside a worm . " How 'd you make out yesterday , Jase ? " Gewald hitched back in his chair , impatient at interruption , I supposed . " All right except for the car . Jimmy said you 'd already seen it . " I handed Charleston the two hundred dollars , saying , " Here 's to pay for the wreck . I could n't help ? " Charleston waved explanations away . " And here 's what 's left of expense money , " I went on and gave him ten dollars plus twenty cents . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Jase . In time . " " So now can the two of us get back to work ? " Gewald rasped out , hunching forward . " The three of us , " Charleston answered . Gewald sized me up , or rather down , like a bartender wondering was I old enough for a beer . " Pretty much of a pup , " he said , turning to Charleston . " He 's got a good nose , " Charleston answered . " Besides , he 's my pup . " " Have it your own way . It 's not mine . Back to business , then . " " You have the full report , " Charleston told him . " All that we know , Jase and I. " " But none of your theories . No suspicions . No hunches. "  | " I would n't want to mislead a state criminal investigator . " " You can cut out the sarcasm . I was sent here . " " Not by my request , Mr. Gewald . " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attorney general thought it was time a trained man took a hand . " " Take it , then . " The words were sharp but came out smooth . " Let us know when and if we can help . " " There are , you know , quite a number of possibilities , " Gewald said , as if it were beyond our power to think of a one . His voice seemed to get softer the more he sawed with it . " Assume , for instance , that Buster Hogue , now dead , was rolling Mrs. Day on the sly . " " I got a very balky imagination there , " Charleston answered . " Nevertheless , assume it . Buster Hogue was a single man , a long-time widower , and stranger things happen . " " Here , I thought to myself , the state criminal investigator had jumped the reservation and faded from sight . Buster Hogue had been fifty or more , older by perhaps fifteen years than Chick Charleston himself . And Mrs. Day ? No ? squared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted , take them for discovered , " Gewald continued , " it would be in the nature of Ben Day , then , to murder Hogue . Right ? " " Maybe , " Charleston replied . " He was n't what you could call an ever-lovin ' husband , though . " " But to proceed . If he did , and one of the Hogue boys knew or even suspected ? Well , there you would be . " Charleston said , " Sure enough . "  | " All right . Unlikely . I 'll switch to the Hogue brothers . It 's altogether possible , as I see it , that that dumb one , Simp , pot shot his father . " Nodding , Charleston said , " Possible . " " The psychiatrist so stated , even if somewhat reluctantly . Then could n't Simp have gone after Day , too ? " " Why ? " " I do n't know . Old animosity stemming from that Forest Service mix-up . Threat of exposure perhaps . And if not Simp , what about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? Put it this way : Simp shoots his father , Day knows it or gets wind of it , one way or another Junior finds out that Day 's wise to the fact and so shuts him up with a bullet . The big-brother act . Or it could be that Junior himself did away with both men , killing Day after shooting his father because Day knew too damn much . " " You sure run the scale . I do n't know why either Hogue boy would shoot his old man . " " Simp could have some looney reason . " " Yep . And Junior inherits . " Charleston was shaking his head slowly , saying no to himself more than to us . " It has been bothersome . " " And still is . " Gewald 's stringy frame came forward with his words . " Look . I want to talk to those boys . I want to talk to that professor who says he had his gun stolen . I want to talk to everyone who had trouble with Hogue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one murder or the other and the two combined , no matter if there 's one killer or two . And I want to talk to Mrs. Ben Day . By your report she took the news of Ben 's death  | very cool . Her husband dead , and her like an oyster . That jells with the business of assignation . Right ? " " She might still be in town , " Charleston told Gewald . " This morning she testified at the inquest you missed . " I put in , " Inquest ? Already ? What was brought out , Mr. Charleston ? " He gave me a half-smile with humor behind it , said , " Person or persons unknown , " went to the door and , opening it , called out , " Jimmy ! See if you can round up Mrs. Ben Day somewhere in town and ask her if she wo n't please come to the office . " While we waited I made my report of the trip . Gewald sat back , resting his hacksaw for other metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hello , " I told Charleston . " Also he decided the wreck was n't my fault . " " Not surprising to me , Jase . Now about this Mike Day ? " " He wants to get his claim in , like I said , and I bet he 's aiming to get himself named administrator of Ben 's estate . " " Another Day another dollar , huh ? Where 's he from ? " " He did n't say . Roundabout , I guess . I took note of his license number . Minnesota plates . " Now Gewald interrupted , his voice sharp again . " He 's not known around here ? Not seen by anybody ? " " Seen by me and Mrs. Collins , " I answered , feeling I was in tune with the sheriff . " And probably his brother Ben knew him . He said he did . " To me he said , " Nuts , " and to Charleston , " Are you and your boy through ? " " Boy " meant punk .  | " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels , of course , to take me around to these people , but I 'll need someone with me who knows the lay of the land . " " Sure . No trouble . " " Right now it 's only interrogations that hold any promise . The evidence is damn scanty ? one spent cartridge casing and a flattened bullet dug out of a corpse that appears to be the same caliber . No casts of tire prints . No fingerprints . No nothing else . " " Nary thing , Mr. Gewald . Nary thing . " What Gewald might have said was n't said because Jimmy knocked at the door and showed Mrs. Day in . With her , not to my lasting surprise , was Mike Day . He wore a dark business suit , as befitted grief , and a sunrise necktie , as did n't . Mrs. Day had on a black outfit that had been new once and maybe stylish . Her face was blank , as if troubles rubbed on troubles had erased all feeling . And yet it struck me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an injection of cheer would make her a goodlooking woman . Standing behind his desk , Charleston introduced Mrs. Day to Gewald , who rose half out of his chair . " And you , " he continued , " must be Mike Day . Jase has told me about you . " Yes , sir , " Day answered with his salesman 's confidence . " We met , though under unfortunate circumstances , occasioned , I must admit , by yours truly . I have made ample restitution , I hope . " He went on , " You know poor Ben is , or was , my brother . I thought ? I hoped ? that  | it would be quite all right with you if I accompanied Marcy Belle here . " " Sit down , you and Mrs. Day , " Charleston said . Gewald held them up . " You 're not an attorney . " The words were more charge than question . " No , sir . Indeed not . Just a relative and friend . I might add , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two terms . Naturally I know something of law . " Charleston got the two visitors to sit down . Gewald did n't look pleased . Seated himself , Charleston opened the wide drawer of his desk , fumbled around and came out with one of his special cigars , which he did n't light . " Mrs. Day , " Gewald said , easing off on his saw , " you know I am here as a representative of the state . We want to find out who killed your husband and hope to advance toward a solution by getting your answers to some questions . Of course , you want to know , too . " " May I intrude ? " Mike Day asked , not really asking . " Marcy Belle , you do n't have to answer any questions . You may stay mute . Under the law a suspect may not be forced to incriminate himself . " Now Gewald employed his saw . " Who says she 's a suspect ? This is informal . No notes . No reporter . " " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big pie face split in a smile . " I am sure , sir , that you merely overlooked the customary precautionary statements antecedent to interrogation . Not that Marcy Belle has anything to conceal . I was merely making sure , for your sake , that procedure be proper . " Looking at him , looking at that large , whiskey-blushed ,  | four-flusher 's face , I felt an uneasy surge of liking for him , a surge not lessened by Gewald 's expression . He was putting on a show , Day was . He was showing up Gewald . And he was n't hurting himself with Marcy Belle . Charleston was leaning back , by aspect satisfied . " All right . All right , " Gewald rasped . " Consider made the statements of your rights under the law , Mrs. Day . Now , to get down to business , it has been remarked that your reaction to your husband 's murder was cool , was indifferent . That 's putting it mildly . What do you have to say about that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Answer him if you wish , Marcy Belle . " She asked , " What ? " Gewald tried again . " The inference is , from your attitude , that you and he were at odds and hence that his death left you undisturbed . Now I ask you what you held against him . " " Say it again . " " You held something against him , did n't you ? " " I was n't there . I did n't hold nothin ' . " " I do n't mean anything physical , nothing that you could hold in your hand . " Exasperation was putting a harder edge on the saw . " What did you hold against him in your mind ? " " What every woman does . " " Every woman ? Every one of his women ? Did he have so many then ? " " How would I know ? " Gewald sighed , but exasperation clawed his face . " Look .  | Try to answer me . You said every woman . What do you mean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's what I mean . " The words came live from the blank face and for an instant stood before me like truth chiseled in stone . " Oh , you are saying that the lot of the wife ? all wives ? is unequal and burdensome ? " " Is that what I said ? " Mike Day broke in , smiling wide . " Sir , can you couch your questions in simpler language ? Mrs. Day does n't comprehend your polysyllabicisms . " Gewald tightened his mouth , looking at no one . I figured he was counting syllables himself . Then he said , " So be it . Mrs. Day , did your husband abuse you , mistreat you , maltreat you ? " She looked at Mike Day , who translated , " Did he beat you up ? " " What if he did ? " " It would give you a motive for removing him from the scene . " He removed hisself by hisself from the scene , night or day , work or not , it did n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He just went . " Was there , I wondered , some sly , some native and hidden intelligence behind her answers . No one could be that dumb . Yes ? No ? She began to be the second person I did n't quite want to admire but still did . Gewald , the trained man , representative of the state , looked as if the quality of patience had had the hell strained out of it .  | " Down to cases , " he said , sawing hard . " Did you kill your husband ? " " I 'm glad you 're not a suspect , Marcy Belle , " Day put in pleasantly . " Did you kill your husband ? " " Me ? Kill him ? Mister , I 'm lucky to be here myself , havin ' him for a husband . " " Did you kill him ? " " Not so 's you could notice . " " Did you ? " " I said no . How many times I got to say it ? " Came a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , his arms folded over his heavy chest , his appearance suggesting what I would call large satisfaction . Knowing Charleston so well , I could tell he was amused . Gewald returned to the attack , using what I supposed he thought was soft persuasion . " All right , Mrs. Day . Thank you . Now I must go on to a delicate subject . " She just looked at him , her mouth slack . I could see her tongue fiddling with her lower teeth , which were good barring a vacancy a fist might have left . " You knew Buster Hogue ? " " Sure . " " How well did you know him ? " " Well enough , I guess . " " Well enough that your relations were intimate ? " " Even after him and Ben had their trouble , I always spoke to him nice and he answered nice . " " That 's not what I 'm trying to get at , and you know it . Assignations . Did you and he arrange assignations ? "  | She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help her unless his smile was a help . " Assignations ? " she asked . " Yes . Assignations ! Trysts ! Lovers ' meetings ! " Gewald jerked to his feet and poked an outraged finger at her . " Goddammit , in plain words , woman , were you screwing him ? " " That 's enough , Gewald , " Charleston said in a voice not loud but carrying . His words did n't surprise me . They just made conscious my unconscious recognition that in him was a lot of the old western gentleman . His order was wasted . " Oh , screw ! " Mrs. Day answered as if in sudden recognition . She began laughing , laughing a laugh that hit me as sad and low-order and yet somehow pitifully fetching . " Me and Mr. Buster Hogue screwing ! You got a mind , man , you have . I never had a chance even if he 'd ast me . " She sobered abruptly , and the old look of no hope settled back on her face . " Me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so much as a new rag . Screw you , too , mister . " Gewald was looking at the floor for more questions , if any . " Speakin ' of kids , " Mrs. Day said , " I got ta see about mine . I left ' em with a friend , and they 'll likely be raisin ' hell now if not sooner . " She got up , not to Gewald 's objection , and went to the door . He did n't have the grace to thank her , much less to apologize . Mike Day followed her , ushered her out and , before closing the door , said to all , " Her innocence is surely  | evident to you gentlemen . That being settled , tell me , Sheriff Charleston , are the judge 's chambers upstairs ? " Gewald sat for a minute or two after they 'd left , then got up , said , " I 'll nose around , " and went out the door . Charleston lighted the cigar he 'd been holding so long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a man ought to have to ante up for a show like we 've seen . " " I kind of like that Mike Day , and Mrs. Day was great in her part . " He smiled and answered , " Sure . Good cast . Confidence man and the poor moron . " " " And Gewald ? " " The trained investigator . " He blew out a plume of smoke and added , " Trained in a crocodile school , I reckon . " " All bite and no brains , huh ? " " No , no , Jase . But bite before brains . " He started to get up . " Unless you have something else for me , " I told him , " I 'll get on with my written report , you know , about the whole case . But gee , Mr. Charleston , I ca n't remember everything that was said here . " He chuckled then . " Do n't have to . " He opened the big drawer of his desk and brought out a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silencer , " he said as he unwrapped it . " But see , Jase . " Inside the towel was a cassette recorder and just outside it , so 's to pick up the voices , a little microphone . I gawked . " And you turned it on when you fingered around for that cigar ? "  | " Good thinking , boy . " " Thank you . Thank you a lot . " " Not too much , Jase . Remember , I 'm just a sheriff , and Gewald represents the state and belongs to the opposition party to boot . So it was n't just for your sake . "  | I ARRIVED AT THE SHERIFF 'S OFFICE next morning just as Charleston did . We went in together and sat . He pushed to the side of his desk a clutter of accumulated paper , his manner indicating he could n't be bothered with such trifles now , if indeed , ever . Halvor had given us goodmorning and taken a newspaper into the private room where he could read without being interrupted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Not until first thing this afternoon , " he answered . " He 's scratching around some more first . " " Where ? " " Old holes not worth scratching at . I had the pisswillie luck to meet him at breakfast . He said he wanted to talk to Felix Underwood and Doc Yak and other assorted characters who might hold a clue unbeknownst . " " Fat chance . " " lase , " he asked , leaning back , " you want to play Kit Carson to our John C. Fremont ? " " Meaning ? " I said , though I felt what was coming . " Yeah . Guide Gewald to Hawthorne 's Hole and Hogue 's Flats and other far and unexplored places . Sorry I ca n't be the chief scout . Not today . "  | " It 's a waste of time , I bet , but sure , if you want me to . " " It 's not so much I want you to as the show 's got to go on . He 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plumb baffled . Two men done in and none jailed . Action is called for . " I said , " I guess . " " We 've got some time , Jase . " He got extra effect by adding , as if as an afterthought , " Time enough , even if I 've caught sight of the stripes of the invisible skunk . " " You have ! " " Yup . But no evidence . Nothing convincing except to me . So I 'm not telling yet . So we have time for Gewald . " " I can keep a secret . " He found a slim cigar , lighted it slowly and drawled , " We-11 . " I knew then he was going to tell me a story . With action called for , he was going to tell a story in the cowpuncher language he used in such cases . Yet he was n't wasting time , not in my book . " Time was , " he said , while making sure the cigar burned all around , " there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and able-bodied except , as you might say , their love muscles had petered out on ' em . " He paused , smiling , though he might have known I got the drift . " That was a shame for a fact , seein ' as both of ' em had had enough women to stock two harems apiece . Like Casey Jones in the song , on the four-posted bedstead they won their fame . " He paused again , letting the story take shape in his mind . " One of them codgers was Herman Bamberger , who still  | shod horses off and on , mostly just before the county fair when people raced their quarter horses . You know the kind . Early foot but not stayers . The other old-timer was Gene Zimmerman , who collected his welfare check and counted it welfare enough . " They was pards , more or less . Gene used to come around to the blacksmith shop and sit on a block and watch Herman tackin ' on shoes . They was pards mostly on account of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastard whereas Gene was a smiler . Different make-ups . You got to remember that . " Having laid the scene , Charleston took two slow drags on his cigar . I waited . " One day a studhorse with some years on him , who was still pretty good on the track but better yet as a sire , was brought into Herman 's shop to be shod . Gene was there looking on . " Well , sir , about the time Herman was gettin ' a front shoe nailed on , the stud pushed out a yard or so of workin ' joy prong . It interested Gene , bringin ' back memories , I reckon . When Herman let the foot down , Gene said , Look , ' pointin ' to how the stud was dingin ' his dong on his belly . Do n't that just make your mouth water ? " ' I was supposed to laugh , of course , and I did , but not too much , feeling , as Charleston 's age and beginning-togray hair came to my mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rueful to him . " That ai n't the point I was makin ' . " Charleston 's words , still cowpuncherish , jarred me away from my sympathy . " Not the point a-tall . " " No ? "  | " No . Herman took a look at that eager pecker , and what he said was , I would nut the son of a bitch . ' That 's the point . End of story , too . " " And that 's a clue ? " I asked . " Think it over . " I was thinking it over when I went to feed and water Mrs. Jenkins ' chickens . Who ? no , whom ? did the story point to ? Everybody at first blush , for no man really liked it that another had more than he did , whether in money , brains , virility , automobiles , girl friends or baseball . Whether in anything except piety probably , though even there there seemed to be some competition . No use thinking about Buster Hogue , my first choice if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was kind of a head-pounder , meaning he was tempted to hammer down sprouts if they pushed up high enough to rival his standing . Junior Hogue might take after his old man , though I had my doubts . Simp Hogue was a no-no . That left Professor Hawthorne , Dr. Pierpont , Guy Jamison , who were as unlikely suspects as the shirttail characters we 'd interviewed . Nothing I could see there . Sheriff or no sheriff , story or no story , my mind kept going back to the Hogues . The chickens attended to , I looked up Terry Stephens , who was out of a job again because an inconsiderate rain had doused the forest fire he was fighting . We played catch . My arm , warmed up , felt strong and good , though I kept Terry chasing after wild pitches . Our team had lost while I was taking Mrs. Jenkins to her new , happy home . Score , 9 to 5 . No team was going to score nine runs off of me , unless I walked the men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one o'clock I was back at the sheriff 's office . Gewald showed up a few minutes later , and we drove away in Gewald 's state car after Charleston had wished Gewald good luck , knowing he would n't have any . Gewald looked like a hell's-fire , ganted-up preacher bent on sniffing and snuffing out sin . He was dressed in a dark suit , wore a dark tie and on his head had a hat clamped and dipped down in front in the manner , if not of preachers , then of cattle buyers , prods in hand , poking their choices out of a corralful of steers . His coat , opened , revealed a belted six-shooter . His mouth had no fun about it . If it ever smiled , I thought , it must have been at the sight of a hanging . A dedicated man , he was , and some words of the sheriff popped into my head . " Beware of dedicated men , Jase . They 'll push dedication clean to destruction , all because they 're so right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to wheel , " I want to see that professor along with his dolly . " He shied me a glance and snorted , " And what the hell are you doing with the baseball ? " I answered , " I do n't know how good you can shoot , " to which he snorted again . I directed him onto the gravel road . By this time I had a jolting acquaintance with every rock in it . What with all the official traffic , I thought , the county and state ought to pave it , counting the cost against punctured gas tanks , flat tires , broken tail pipes and other dear benefits of the wild .  | The county weed-cutters had been along , though , so 's to show people that their tax money worked , and the smell of snipped and torn growth came good and sharp to my nose . The sun was a high kindness today , and a breeze sifted our dust away . I could have enjoyed myself , alone or in other company . We scattered a covey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dedication did n't jibe with delay . At the late Ben Day 's mailbox Gewald braked , seeing the name , and got out and thumbed me to do likewise . He asked me where we figured Day 's killer had hidden . I could n't be certain , now that the brush and grass had been mowed , but I showed him as well as I could . He began poking and moving the downed growth , but it was me , not really looking but just idly scuffing , who saw the shine of a cartridge . I picked it up . It had been fired . It read .303 sAV . Gewald said , " What ? Give it here . " Having no standing , I gave it . He studied it and put it in his pocket , rasping , " Huh . Just like the first , " and led the way back to the car , mission accomplished . It happened that Professor Hawthorne and Geet both were at home ? which might have been rated lucky . They came out of the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drawn back from her forehead , fell loose down her shoulders . That 's all I saw of her immediately , her face and the hair drawn back and rippling , for a couple of lines from Lewis Carroll ran in my head . She was n't a child but still ?  | " Of course , sir , " Professor Hawthorne was saying after introductions , " we will help in any way we can . Come in , wo n't you ? " He took us into that pleasant lodge room and saw that we were seated . He wore a long-used corduroy jacket and pants but looked trim as ever . For a silly moment I fancied his Vandyke must have been guaranteed perpetual care when the Lord first plotted it out . In character , Gewald kept his hat on , though it seemed to me all heads should uncover in the presence of Geet . Gewald started , " I am here , Professor ? " " Please , not professor : " " All right , Mr. Hawthorne . I am here , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , none whatever , toward the solution of two cowardly murders . I hope to determine the guilty party or parties , no matter the failure so far . " " I see , " Hawthorne said . " You are taking over the case , then ? " " That is too much to say . I am helping or , if you please , leading the investigation . " " I wish you success . But a good many of us , most , I daresay , have faith in our sheriff . " Gewald nodded shortly . " Of course . Of course . A good man , but there 's a saying about two heads being better than one . " My father would have answered , " Even if one is a sheep 's head . "  | " Yes . I have heard that old saw . " Gewald did n't show he found any sarcasm there . lIe sawed on . " A few questions then , Mr. Hawthorne , by way of clearing the undergrowth . I am given to understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not troubles , Mr. Gewald . Mere differences , and those laid aside . Sheriff Charleston has my report . Surely you 've seen it . I have nothing to add . " " He had to tell me , having failed to put it on paper . I 'll assume he was accurate , if not professionally thorough . " " A safe assumption , I 'd say . " " More interesting to me , " Gewald said , " is the three-ohthree Savage you report missing . " " Begging your pardon , not what I report missing but what is actually missing . Is and was . " " It has n't shown up ? " " No . I would have notified the sheriff . " " Yes . I suppose , " Gewald seemed to agree . " Now do n't you find it peculiar that the rifle is missing , was missing while one murder , then another , was done ? " " Of course . Odd indeed . " " The guilty rifle , you might call it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established in its absence . " " Circumstantial but to me convincing enough . Especially ? " Gewald interrupted himself by getting up . He reached into his pocket and produced the casing I had found at the mailbox . " What do you make out of this ? " " No more , even less , than you . I already knew about it . "  | " Not this casing , Mr. Hawthorne . It is the second we 've discovered and , like the first , came from a three-oh-three Savage . " " May I ask where you found it ? " As Gewald hesitated , maybe thinking he alone had the right to pose questions , I broke in . " It was close to Ben Day 's mailbox , Professor Hawthorne , right where the sheriff and I thought the killer had hidden . " I could n't resist adding , " I found it myself . " Not until after I had spoken did it really strike me that Geet and I had sat as outsiders , as mute listeners to a dialogue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a glance of what might have meant appreciation ? which Gewald did n't . We were all silent for a minute . Then Gewald said , " The guilty gun . Two casings from same . " " May I say again , " Hawthorne asked , his beard a little thrust out , " that it has not been established from what gun the cartridges were fired ? And who can say , at the present stage of investigation , that the same rifle fired both of them ? " He was right , of course , but , it seemed to me , just technically . One .303 rifle missing . Two .303 cartridges fired . Q.E.D. , but not to him yet . I wished he would n't be so professorish . " You may say what you please , Mr. Hawthorne , " Gewald answered . " You might also quit quibbling if you are as eager as I to determine the culprit or culprits . Understand , I am not accusing you , not of anything . I am not even suspicious , except as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist that the circumstances are funny , funny ' meaning peculiar , funny ' meaning open to suspicion . " " It 's you who are funny ! " Geet 's voice rang clear in the room , reminding me of the bell sound of a metal triangle tapped to bring the hay hands to supper . " Doubting my father , whom you do n't even know ! " The pure , untroubled brow was not untroubled now . I did n't admire it the less . " It 's your privilege that he 's even willing to talk to you . " " Hush , Geet , " Hawthorne told her . " He 's only doing what he believes is his duty . " " And making a mess of it . " " Her unfriendly eyes turned from Gewald to me , still unfriendly . " Mess or no mess , " Gewald answered , not fazed at all , " I want to see your assortment of guns , Mr. Hawthorne . I want to see where you kept the Savage until you reported it missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hawthorne got up , unlocked the big cabinet and showed his prize rifles . The collection did n't interest Gewald very much . His concern with history went back only as far as Buster Hogue 's death . " And now , if you 'll follow me , " Hawthorne said . The two walked out of the room , leaving Geet and me there . " Why did you have to bring that person here ? " she asked when they were out of earshot , her eyes still unfriendly . " That person ! " " He represents the state , " I tried to explain . " There was nothing else for it . "  | " Who determined that ? " " Sheriff Charleston . Look , I ca n't pick and choose ... " " He could have come himself . " " Other fish to fry , so he told me . " " Some vote-catching clambake , I suppose . " " Now look here , Geet . You ca n't fault Sheriff Charleston to me . " " Tell him hello from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen had been ringing , shorts and longs and combinations , in the way of many-party lines . Now , abruptly , she came from her chair , graceful as grace itself , said , " That 's for us , " and hurried from the room . Her brow was less troubled when she returned . She took her seat and sat thoughtfully . She even smiled , but more to herself than to me , I suspected . After a while she said , " You 'll have to forgive me , Jase . I got upset . You 're all right . " " I 'm glad something changed your mind . " " You 're all right , I say again , you and your baseball and your trust in the sheriff . " Gewald and Professor Hawthorne came back to the room , neither looking as if a peace pact had been signed . Gewald said , " Come on , kid . " I followed him out .  | " HocuE RANCH , " Gewald said after he had planted himself behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifics when necessary . " Your professor , " he said once we had begun to rattle over the rocks . " Niggling high-toned talker , or did n't you notice , being under hypnosis ? " I ignored the dangler he tied to the question , not wanting to bring Geet into the conversation . " You did n't do so bad yourself , " I said . " Three years of law school , " he answered . " Oh . " For a minute he was silent , then went on as if the explanation was n't explanation enough . " My father was a minister . Educated man . Knew right from wrong . So do I. " I said , " Oh , " again . " I found out the law is a liar , and I quit it . " Mr. Dedication , I thought . And to understand all was to forgive all , but my forgiveness was limited to a balky respect for his single-minded rigidity.  | " Sings hallelujah , any lawyer does , if he can win a notguilty verdict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' when he turns loose on society a sinner against it . Venal , dishonest profession , the law . " Gewald rolled down the window and spit and was silent , presumably giving the law more of the same in his mind . We crossed the bridge west of the picnic grounds , passed the turn-off to Old Man McNair 's place and wheeled on . The mid-afternoon sun was beginning to blaze , but the day was still good . A breeze from the west brought the scent of pine with it , and the mountains rose gaunt and beautiful , blue against the blue sky . From this elevation I could see the whole valley sweeping southeast and beyond it the free roll of the plains . Badger Clark 's lines contrasting east and west came to mind . Such as they never could understand The way we have loved you , young , young land . What was more , Jase was all right ? after one telephone call . My hand tightened on my all-right baseball . We swerved to the left at my direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haystacks stood , lay the Hogues ' ranch house and outbuildings , part of the latter screened from sight by the house . Some scattered cows gazed curiously at us , and one of them in the manner of cows decided to cross ahead of us at the last minute and came close to becoming a casualty .  | Gewald braked to a halt in front of the house . It was a sprawling , old-fashioned building to which age and size and rude taste had given an air . A roofed , deep verandah ran across the whole front of it . Out of the car , I could hear the cackle of hens and the soft blat of a calf . Behind the house someone was pounding , the sound coming clean and sharp like metal on metal . At Gewald 's thumbed order I went to the door and knocked . Junior Hogue 's wife opened it , looking too hot to touch after a session over the cook stove . She was a fat , tidy woman with clear , honest eyes . " You 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with so little shown curiosity that I wondered if solitude and hard work had not filed the normal bump down . Followed by Gewald , I went around to the back . Junior and Simp were setting a new post for a corral , Simp holding and Junior shoveling and tamping the dirt solid around it . Near them on the ground were a hammer and a bucket of spikes . Both men , stopping work , looked up without any word of welcome as I approached . I introduced them to Gewald and said , " Mr. Gewald is a state criminal investigator . He 's here to find out who shot your dad . " Junior stared at Gewald , his heavy face reflecting suspicion . Simp was n't talking . Junior said , " What 's the matter with the sheriff ? His job . " I answered for Gewald , who just stood , sizing the two up . " The state thinks the sheriff needs a helping hand . " Junior said , " Huh , " as if the matter had been considered and dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out who killed your father . " The words were as much question as statement . Junior reversed his shovel and tamped with the handle . Between tamps he answered , " Smart thinkin ' . " The sun got a clean shot at us there in the open . A bead of sweat ran a clean furrow down Junior 's grimed face . Simp toweled his crotch with his pants . Gewald must have been hot , suit coat , revolver and all , but he was n't sweating . I wished for a cold drink . " Simon , " Junior said , " see the post 's straight . " Simp changed its angle . Out of somewhere ? outbuilding or field ? a big dog came barking . He lay down panting before he could take a bite out of me . A horse thrust its head out of the halfdoor of the barn and let out a whicker . A good horse , it looked like . All Hogue horses were . Simp , holding the post , stared at the animal , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among humans . Junior kept on working . " I 'd like to ask you some questions , " Gewald said . " Ask ' em . " " Here in the sun ? While your attention 's divided between me and that posthole ? " Without a word Junior let the shovel fall . Before he moved off , he said to Simp , " I 'll be back in a shake , Simon . " Gewald told him , " Better both of you come . " " You 're invited , too , Simon , " Junior said , then turned to Gewald and added , " But you lay off him . Hear ? He do n't know anything . "  | That last remark , I thought , had a wider application than Junior intended . If Simp knew anything , it was about a world unseen by other eyes , though in his own eyes now flickered the shadows of misgiving , as if strangers had invaded his realm . Junior took us around to the wide verandah and motioned toward seats . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of straight-backed chairs . Simp took the glider and , like a kid , began swinging . Gewald moved a chair around so 's to half-face him . I sat in the rocker , it being the only seat left . I could hear Mrs. Junior back in the kitchen , getting well done along with whatever she had in the oven . " Simon , " Gewald began , " just a couple of things that may help us . Do n't be alarmed , boy . " " I told you to lay off him , " Junior said . Simp swung and , swinging , started a conversation no one could understand with someone nobody saw . " A couple of questions ca n't hurt him , " Gewald answered to Junior . " They better not . " " Simon , " Gewald said then , " do you have any idea , any idea at all , how your father met his death ? How he might have met it ? " Simp , on the down swing , gave Gewald a wide stare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shout and resumed his private , untranslatable talk . Junior said , " He met his death from a bullet . " " Hell , I know . Simon ! You , Simon ! What do you know , what do - you suspect , about the death of your father ? "  | Irritation was putting a keener edge on Gewald 's saw voice . Simp slowed his swing and finally stopped it . He looked at Junior as if asking help , a lost child asking help . " If he does n't know anything , how can he say anything ? " Junior asked . In his face I thought I could see a thunderhead forming . " He understands , and you understand he understands , and , by God , as the son of the slain man you ought to cooperate . " " I would , if you knew your ass from third base . " " I know enough to know when a man 's faking . He 's faking . " " The man is nuts , Simon , " Junior said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The question is simple . So can the answer be . " Gewald had softened his tone , then went back to hard stroke . " Simon ! Answer me ! Any idea who killed your father ? " For a minute Simp wrenched his eyes to the real world . They flowed with fear . It struck me he might fly away , like a bird , into the refuge of heavens he alone knew . He said , " No idea , have we , Junior ? No notion at all . Eh , Junior ? " " You 're mighty right , Simon , " Junior answered . " No notion at all . " Assured , Simp burst out in talk , not to us , not in our language . " Shut up , Simon , and listen ! " Gewald 's voice cut through the gabble . Simp shut up , his short assurance lost , his fears returned . " Did you have it in for your old man , Simon ? "  | It struck me that Gewald had forgotten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat . As the thought struck me , Junior jerked forward in his chair and said , " Jesus Christ ! " Gewald took a fresh breath to power his saw . " Did you kill him ? Simon , did you kill him ? Want to talk in a jail cell ? " It was n't fear now but pure terror that swam in Simp 's eyes . He leaped from the glider , jumped from the porch and ran around the house yelling . In that same moment Junior sprang up , plunged at Gewald and swung at his face . The chair and Gewald went over . Gewald clawed for his six-shooter . I got it first while Junior stood over him ? a big man dazed by the punches of circumstance . Gewald climbed to his feet . His mouth leaked blood . He said to me , lisping , " Arrest this man ! " " No . " " You have the gun . " " Not the authority . " " Obstructing an officer in the pursuit of his duties . Give me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " No , " again . The officer in pursuit of his duties might have counted among them a pot shot at Junior . I added in the pursuit of peace , " Do n't hit him any more , Junior . " There was no real need for that last . Junior 's rage had been shot with the one blow . He said , " I got to find Simon . He 's scared crazy , my own brother is . " " You 'll have to come in to the office , Junior , " I told him .  | " I will . I promise I will , just as soon as convenient . I got to get Simon calmed down . " " Promises ! " Gewald chimed in , his speech thick . " From a man like this one ! " Blood was dripping down his chin . He did n't notice . " I said I 'd come in , Jase . That means I will . " " Good enough . Good enough for Mr. Charleston and me . Junior jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting , " Simon . Oh , Simon . It 's only me . Junior . " Gewald said , " Shit , " and at last wiped his chin , and that was the mood in which we went back to town . Shitty.  | " WELL , HOW 'S MY short-peckered friend ? " It was morning of the next day ? mid-morning because I had slept late again ? and the speaker was one Mike Day . He was just coming out of Old Doc Yak 's office , his big face split in a smile that suggested he had just sold the map to the legendary Lost Dutchman mine . Behind him was Doc Yak , looking pleased , too ? which was n't his habit . Ordinarily it was as if he could n't take time for a smile on account of all his concerns , two of whom I could glimpse in the waiting room waiting for him to finish his facial experiment . " Late for work , " I answered , and then asked of Doc , " How 's Mr. Gewald ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hogue ranch the night before and had charged into Doe 's office to get repaired . " Needed a stitch or two , " Doc Yak said through the smile that showed he was a little long in the tooth . " That was all , not counting dental attention . " I signaled a quick good-bye but , though my sudden idea called-for speed , did n't run to the office . Mike Day , I thought . Yep , that Mike Day would bear some investigation .  | And Sheriff Charleston for sure would be at his desk at this hour . He had n't been last night , either early or late , and so had n't got my report about yesterday . When I went there , Halvor , left alone in the office , had told me , " He 's gone to the big city again , with company or without . Take your pick . " His imagination was making him grin . " Know what took him there ? " " Why , now , I imagine it was wheels , saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So 's your wit , " I said and went home . Later , so important did I think the day 's happenings , I tried to telephone Charleston , tried five or six times , and lagged off to bed at midnight with Mabel Main 's words in my ears . " How in hell do I know his whereabouts ? Because I 'm a telephone operator ? Get yourself under the feathers , Jase . That 's probably where your big boy friend is . " Maybe the sour note of disappointment had come into her voice . " Whose feathers I would n't guess . " I fell asleep still wishing I could make my report . Now , at io A.M. , Charleston was in the office but not at his desk . He was standing at a window and answered to my good morning with an absent-minded , " Hi , Jase . " Jimmy Conner was on the phone . He hung up , got up and said , " Kid locked in a bathroom . " He left , taking with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn Mike Day , " I said , taking the first opportunity to alert Charleston . " Yes , " he answered , not turning from the window . " We ought to inquire about him . " " So ? " " Look here , Mr. Charleston , " I said to his back . " It  | could have been this way . Mike went to collect the debt from his brother . That would be the strange car that Guy Jamison saw . So the brothers got into a fight over the debt , and Mike shot Ben . Then he took out fast , let a little time go by , and came back , saying he had just heard about Ben 's death . What he wanted , what he wants now , is to be appointed administrator of the estate . That way he 'll collect the money he loaned and probably something to boot . " Charleston turned now , his smile small and thoughtful . " Could be , Jase , " he said . " If you can make other things fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fit of inspiration I had n't thought about other things , such as where the body was found , the tennis shoes , the trail in the grass , the new Cadillac that Jamison would have identified . But still and all ? " Mike Day wo n't be appointed administrator , " Charleston was saying . " Why not ? " He was a long time in answering , as if my question had to work up through an overlay . " He 's got a record in Minnesota . His license plates led me to it . Record enough to deal him out . Some swindle , some shady dealings in stocks . Fine and six months probated . " " And still at it ! You can almost bet your boots he just made a sale to Doc Yak . " Again my words seemed buried , or , rather , to enter no more than the fringe of his thought . He answered absently , " I reckon Doc Yak 's old enough to take care of himself . Job for the county attorney anyhow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jase . It  | has to be . There 's no other answer . But to prove it , to get other people to see , there 's the pinch and the bind . I need a tool . " I could n't give him one even if I knew more , so I said , " Could I ask where is Gewald ? " " He got to me early and told about yesterday . Now he 's gone to the city for dental work . " He added with the smile that meant sour amusement , " Did n't trust our local practitioner . " " But he 'll be back ? " " Sure . Chompin ' with his new bridgework . I fought a delaying action this morning , his teeth and I did , but he 's out to get Junior . He 'll bring charges . Assault . Obstruction . Grounds enough , too . He might even push for an information charging murder or murders , mad as he is . " " If he 's still as mad as he was yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another one in . He spoke as if idly . " I could tell him about Buster Hogue 's hat . " " Why ? " " He might get bamboozled by it and held up for a spell . " " Bamboozled ? " " Like we were . The hat does n't signify , hole or no hole . It 's one of those little things that stands big in the way of progress . Devil 's work , Jase . What does it matter whether Loose Lancaster saw Buster Hogue take his hat off before he was beaned in his bald spot ? ? which he did n't and that 's no matter , either . He saw the hat lying away from its perch after the shot and got mixed in his dates . Hell . "  | The sheriff swiveled away from me and then swiveled back , as if determined to put his mind on what I had to say . " Now tell me , " he said . " I could n't report last night , not with you gone some place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " I went on and told about yesterday , all that I could remember , which , I was sure , left out nothing important . The telephone rang a couple of times while I was talking , as it did again later , but the matters seemed trifling though Charleston made note of them . When I was finished , he said , " Deductions , if any ? " " For an innocent man Simp Hogue seemed too scared . " Charleston put in , " For an innocent , sane man . " " All right , but what 's more , Junior Hogue shielded him . Did n't want him questioned . Did n't want him to answer . " " To you , then , they 're suspect , one or the other or both ? " " I do n't know . You asked how things hit me . " " Of course , Jase , and thanks . Good report . Now let 's go back . " We were interrupted by Jimmy Conner , who came in carrying the jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law had invited to jail . " Kids , " he said , as if being young was a capital crime . He rid himself of the keys and the jimmy and took the grub to the back . Then Charleston asked , " Why do you figure Ben Day was killed , Jase ? " " Because someone had it in for him . " Charleston smiled a sort of fatherly smile . " You can do  | better than that . " It struck me that he was being indulgent . " Blackmail , " I answered from a sudden enlightenment that embarrassed me because it had been so late coming . " Right . Victim or victimizer ? " " Far as I know , Ben Day did n't have much . " " Right again . " " Where does that get us ? " I asked , knowing almost before he replied . " Closer . It rules out the peedads . Who but the damn tax-gatherers would try to get money out of Loose Lancaster , Oscar Oliphant , Pierre Chouquette , Old Man McNair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It sure as hell leaves the Hogues . Junior 's got a bankroll now his father is dead . I hear there 's a trust fund for Simp . " " Yes . Who else ? " " Guy Jamison , I guess , and Professor Hawthorne , I guess , and Doctor Pierpont , I guess , but I do n't guess it 's any of them . Might as likely be Old Doc Yak or Felix Underwood or you or anybody , except they were n't at the picnic . " I was getting mixed-up and out of the mixup asked , " But did they have to be at the picnic ? " " You mean , did he have to be ? As my old granny used to say , put your thinking cap on . " " Affirmative , " I told him , pleased to have hit on a term so professional . He nodded , dismissing the subject , and asked out of left field , " How far along is the report you 've been writ-ing ? "  | " Pretty far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you can , and let me see it . " " It 's not filled out like I want it . It 's mostly what people said , plus just an idea or two of my own . I aim to get it in better shape sometime , " I said , feeling shy about having him read it although I had n't put anything very personal or intimate in it . " That 's what I want , what people said . " " Could I ask why ? " " Pisswillie , Jase . I 'm a rube sheriff , as Gewald would tell you . Do n't take notes except in my head . Not often , I do n't . And what I put there may get blurred , not being written on parchment with indelible ink . Confirmation . Correction . Addition . Reminder . They 're what I need . And you 're just the boy that can do it , too , as the old man said to the Lord when praying for relief from his piles . " " All right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be here . Get along . " I fed the damn chickens again before going home . They had adopted me , the fool birds , forgiving the swing of the guillotine in the light of my handouts of grain . I thought , as they clustered clucking around me that , if ever I beheaded another , it would be out of necessity . Yep . For good nutrition , good-bye trust . I worked all that afternoon and into the supper hour on my report . Now that Charleston wanted to see it , it had to be accurate , down to the crossing of is and the dotting of i 's . Mother interrupted me just once , saying as she put down a plate of fresh cookies , " What in the world , Jase ? A whole book you 're writing ? "  | " The whole truth , " I answered and thanked her and kept on working . It was the edge of dark , or a little later than that , when I handed my account to the sheriff . Halvor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sherlock Holmes rides again . " " I saddled up for him , " Charleston replied , his tone sharp , for him sharp . " Halvor , I 'll be here till all hours . Why do n't you take the night off ? But keep in touch . " Halvor seemed so pleased at the prospect that he appeared not to notice the suggestion was a dismissal . I watched him as he went out , a big , good-natured man with a self-reputation for wit , a fondness for women , and a well-known generosity of heart . Charleston riffled my pages and then began reading . I waited , five minutes , ten , maybe more , seeing him bob his head now and then and now and then hearing him say , " Yes , yes , " to himself . The phone rang , and I answered it . Mrs. Kindrick , who owned six no-account curs , was calling to complain that one of them had been poisoned . Thank heavens , he was recovering , but still and all it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? I acknowledged as much and promised our vigilance , thinking so doggy a woman maybe ought to buy some strychnine of her own . To the sheriff 's inquiring gaze I said , " Kindrick dog poisoned , but not enough . " He answered , " Hum-m , " and went on reading and by and by said , " Jase , a damn fine report . With your consent I 'll take excerpts from it right now , and you might as well go on home . "  | He did n't , and I did n't , for at that moment Junior Hogue entered with a gun in his hands . He looked , I thought , desperate , though it was hard to read that heavy face . I kept my eyes on him and the rifle and hitched my tail to the edge of my chair . He walked to the desk , swung the gun , butt foremost , to Charleston and said , " I found it . " " A three-oh-three Savage . " " You asked if we had one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle , which looked old and beat-up , saying , " Sit down , Junior , " as he proceeded . " What 's more , I told Jase here I 'd come in , " Junior continued . " You got a charge against me , ai n't you ? " It came to me then that Junior was not desperate in the way I had feared but , rather , moody and muted , his usual loud mouthiness reduced by the worry of circumstance . Charleston levered open the breach of the gun . He answered , " Not yet , Junior . Maybe soon . Maybe tomorrow . We stalled it so far . " His gaze did n't come up from the gun as he added , " Did I tell you it was a three-ohthree Savage that killed your father and also Ben Day ? " " I could guess at it . " " And you went looking ? " " No . I just happened to see it in the toolhouse , stacked up with some old axles and junk . I was searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? Gewald ? scared him crazy . " " Simon knew where it was ? " " I do n't know . " The question put new wrinkles in  | his coarse face . " But Simon was n't hidin ' in the toolhouse . And I tell you he would n't ? " " Hold on , " Charleston said . " To find answers I got to ask questions . How did Simon and your father get along ? What was their relationship ? " Junior sighed and shook his head and moved in his chair . " The old man was mighty disappointed in Simon . He tried hard to bring him up to scratch , you know , puttin ' out good money , plenty of it , for that phony headhealer . I guess he ? the old man , I mean ? could n't help showin ' how let down he was with my brother . " " And you acted as the buffer ? As Simon 's protector ? " " You would , too , " Junior answered , as if defending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to like the big lug . Charleston asked , " Did they quarrel ? " " Simon do n't quarrel . He just whoops and talks crazy or goes quiet and draws into himself . That , or he runs away . Dad scared him . " " You and your father quarreled , huh ? " " Sure . Mostly on account of Simon . But neither of us ever thought about killin ' the other . Christ sake ! " Charleston had not only looked at the rifle , from butt to muzzle , but he had sniffed at the opened breach and put a scrap of white paper in it and had sighted down the barrel for wear and burned powder . Now he said , " Bad shape . Loose breach and worn rifling . " " Once it was used hard , I guess , " Junior replied , " but for a long time it 's just been layin ' around . We never fired it . "  | " Someone did , Junior . Someone did recently . " " It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notch . " Here . Let me see . " A smell at the opened breach was enough to bring out of Junior , " Oh , Jesus ! " He handed the rifle back . As he sat there , silenced and looking bewildered , Charleston said , " I think you can help us , Junior . " " How ? " " Let us take your fingerprints . " " That 's crazy . They 'll be on the rifle . You know I 've handled it . " " All the same , I want your prints . You 've given me an idea , Junior . I been wanting a tool . " He turned . " lase , your printing kit here ? " By good luck it was . As I moved to get it , Junior was saying , " I do n't get it , but all right . But do n't try to take Simon 's prints . Not guilty ? he is n't ? and , besides , you 'd scare him shitless . " " Not Simon 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Junior let me fingerprint him . For an amateur I did pretty well . When I had finished , Charleston said , tapping the butt of the rifle , " Keep things to yourself , Junior , but , you see , this is n't your gun . "  | CHARLESTON WAS OUT of the office when I arrived there next morning after fighting a wind that came close to sweeping me into its stream of torn branches and gravel and weeds and discarded containers . Halvor was on hand , though , answering the phone when it rang and otherwise reviewing his prowess while he considered adding scalps to his coupstick . That 's what I guessed , anyway . The phone rang two times . Once , Halvor told me , it was Mrs. Durton calling to report a case of indecent exposure . Otto Dacey again , who exposed himself only to pee and not always then , but what could you do , besides scold , with a man declared sane ? " Yes , Mr. Gewald , " Halvor said when the phone rang again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . Yes , right soon , I expect . " Jody Lester , our part-time stenographer , came in and laid some typed sheets on Charleston 's desk , sighing , " Overtime , " as she did so . " Your sheriff has no regard for the poor working girl . " Halvor had plenty of regard , though . He showed it as she switched out of the office . Then he said , reverting ,  | " The state gets some rare sparrows , Sherlock . Even I could do better , I bet , than Mr. Gewald . Even old Jimmy . Even you that the sheriff has somehow took under his wing . " He lighted a shorty cigarette ? no filters for him ? and gave me a queer look . " Damn funny about you , " he said . " If I did n't know the sheriff so well ? " " Use your head ! " I answered , feeling blood climb my face . " It 's simple . If he used you or Jimmy same as he uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day duty , both . That , or he 'd have to put on an extra man which the office is n't budgeted for . " " Dumb kid , " he said while the thought percolated . " Yeah . Anyhow , the baby is his and yours , the killin 's , I mean , and it 's all right with me , seein ' the baby is such a bastard . " Charleston came in then , grinned a hello , his teeth showing white in his wind-reddened face , and moved into the private office . I followed , thinking he might want me to . On the flat of the desk there were my report and a few pages in his handwriting that I imagined were excerpts from my deathless prose . In a corner stood the Savage . From a drawer he took Junior Hogue 's fingerprints , which Junior himself had signed . While he looked at them , studying some other matter , I asked because the bare possibility nagged at me , " You do n't think Junior was playing it sly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No ruse . His father might have . Not Junior . " " He seemed to think the rifle was his , sure enough . "  | " He did , Jase , and it was n't and is n't ? and that fits the scheme . You care to take my fingerprints , boy ? " I thought , " What in hell , now ? " but walked into the main office , got Halvor to move , and took out my kit . After I took his impressions , he signed a name , not his , to them . The name was T. A. McNair . " Now yours , " he said , not explaining . To mine he had me sign Oscar Oliphant . " I might pick up a couple more , just for effect , understand , " he said as if all were plain to me . " Maybe some true ones , so 's to satisfy truth and my conscience . " He grinned , the grin deepening the lines around his mouth that weather had worn . " Thrice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we cleaned our hands , I said , " I do n't get it . " " You will , " he answered . " Maybe . Maybe . Long shot . Like shootin ' over a hill or around a corner . Changin ' the figure , it might come out in the wash if we can get it to wash . " " When ? " I felt entitled to ask . " Ca n't say , Jase . Let 's go out . I went shy on my breakfast what with one thing and another . " " Gewald 's due in , " I told him . He made a small face and gave a small shrug . " It wo n't hurt Mr. Gewald to wait . " Outside , the wind caught us . It was like a hand in the face or a push on the back , depending . For a space I turned hind end to it so 's to let my lungs breathe , and Charleston yanked his hat hard on his head . Low over the mountains the wind clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . The sun shone , the upper sky was bright , but from the west came the screech and assault of torn air . We were in front of the Bar Star when here came Gewald , forging ahead as if neither gloom of night nor wind of day could stay him from the completion of his appointed rounds . He wore a light overcoat which blew heavily at his sides . He halted and gave a rasping hello to the wind . His lip was still angry , and a tooth looked as if it had had just repair enough to last him to the next service station . " What 've you done ? " " Investigated , " Charleston answered . The words , spoken loud , had been torn from them and borne east to far-away flatlands , and now he added , " Ca n't hear myself think . " He opened the door of the Bar Star and motioned us in . No one was inside except the bartender , Smoky LaFrance , and Otto Dacey , who looked at us from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind blow him ? which was just as well . We were hardly seated at a table , hardly had time to refuse drinks , than Gewald asked , " You bring Junior Hogue in ? " " Did n't need to . He came in by himself . " Gewald let out , " Ah-h , " indicating satisfaction . " Now I can squeeze him . " He opened his coat and leaned back . " He 's holding back on us , you can bet . " " Think so ? " " Never a doubt . I 'll squeeze it out of him . "  | " When and where ? " " Right away . In the county jail . " He came forward and studied Charleston 's unrevealing face and asked as if he could n't believe what might be the answer , " You held him ? " " No . " " Assault ! Impeding an officer of the law ! And likely a key witness in two murder cases ! Yet you did n't hold him . Why in hell not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness was n't on hand . " " Good God ! I 've met a lot of sheriffs in my time ? " A shake of Gewald 's head finished that sentence . " All right . I 'll go out and get him myself . The kid here better steer me again . " I said , hardly believing I said so , " Not this kid , " and thought I saw a glint of approval in Charleston 's eyes . Before any of us could go on , the door opened and let Junior Hogue in . Gewald 's voice sawed out a soft , " Ha-a . " Junior walked to us and , ignoring Gewald , said to Charleston , " Sooner or later , probably sooner , you told me . You want me now ? " " Yes , by God ! " Gewald 's bruised lip gave his saw the hint of a stutter , as if the blade had been flawed . " You 're coming with me . " Junior still ignored him . " Any difficulty , I 'll snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making a jingle . His revolver was in sight on his hip .  | " No , " Charleston said , his tone contained . " He wo n't do that , Junior . " Gewald scraped back his chair , like a man making ready to rise . " Some things I wo n't put up with . " " Same here . " Charleston 's voice , still quiet , had an edge of held anger in it . " By law I do n't know that I have to put up with you . " " Common sense makes the rules . " Junior was looking from one to the other now as if bewildered that he , a wanted man , had raised such a row between two men of the law . " I 'll go on my own , Charleston , " Gewald continued . " No thanks to you , as I 'll sure God report . " He paused as though to find the right pitch . " And now , Mr. Sheriff , you ca n't keep me from filing charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nope . Suit yourself . No cuffs , though . " Now Charleston bent over the table and fixed Gewald with voice and eye . " But I 'll tell you this , Mr. Gewald . Once arrested , Junior Hogue will be released on his own recognizance to appear for trial at a later date , later than might be to your convenience and liking . You can think about that . " Gewald 's mouth opened , obviously to his hurt for he was quick in closing the gap . Between tight lips he said , " If you were n't an officer of the law , I 'd suspect you had put a fix in . " Charleston gave him a grin with no humor in it . " As an officer of the law , I 'd suspect you were right . "  | THERE WAS ONE THING or two that I did know , more that I did n't and at least a couple beyond guesswork accounting . The sheriff did n't want the Hogue brothers pushed , not now , anyhow , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep Junior Hogue out of jail . But why ? A belief in an innocence more important than the guilt of assault ? A hunch that , with freedom , the Hogues would betray themselves ? The first guess was the likelier , I figured , though for myself I could n't dismiss the unwelcome feeling that Junior or Simp Hogue or both were involved in the killings . The business of fingerprinting , and where could it get us ? Sure , there would be prints on the rifle , just left by Junior and Charleston , and possibly older ones which , though , an amateur like me could n't lift . I filed the deal under the head of ridiculous , suspecting it was n't . I could understand , or , rather , imagine why Charleston had asked Junior and me not to blab about finding the rifle . Simple : what the guilty party did n't know could hurt him .  | Why had Charleston gone to the city those two nights ? Not to entertain a date , whoever she was , I felt sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What excerpts had Charleston taken from my report , and why ? Pass again . What would I do with Mrs. Jenkins ' chickens ? Go on feeding them until the last ancient died of the roup or the pip and so closed down the rest home ? There was enough grain on hand to nourish them into fat middle age . Today was Friday , two weeks and a day from the night of Buster Hogue 's shooting , and on Sunday I was scheduled to pitch . My arm felt as rusty as an abandoned pump handle ? which seemed not to matter much , considering the general state of affairs . The general state of affairs , represented by one item , stuck sore in my gizzard as I wandered down the street . Less than an hour ago Charleston had dismissed me , saying , " Take the day off , Jase . Go fishing , or warm up your soup bone for Sunday 's game . See you another day , boy . " I went , the words being orders , and , walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his behavior preceding it . He had had Jody Lester in the office that morning and had dictated to her for a solid hour and in that time worked down and through his neglected if unimportant correspondence . The last letter was from a lady named Charleston who wrote from Miami wanting to know , among other things , if he was related to her or to a mis. sionary who had distinguished himself by getting killed in the Congo . She had found the sheriff 's name , she said ,  | through a sister-in-law , a grassroots writer on politics , who had paused at our courthouse last summer while touring . At the finish of his dictation Charleston had got rid of me . Fine thanks for my services . Mike Day was coming out of the bank and called to me as I passed by , " Hi , you , boy . " He approached and asked , " What 's new ? " " Nothing . " " Too bad , " he said and went on , his big face momentarily clouded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present I 'm staying at the ranch . A financial sacrifice , too , but a man does what he must . " I wondered when he would learn the estate was n't his to administer and how he would act then . But it was none of my business , nothing was , and the hell with him anyway . " To change the subject , " he said , " I have a suspicion the sheriff 's on a cold trail , that is , if he 's on one at all . " " So . " " The way I figure it , Ben made enemies not just outside but inside of prison . One of his old pen pals , so to speak , could have come to the ranch and done him in . No way to tell who . " " Sounds neat , " I answered , " but how come they met at the mailbox , how come Ben had on sneakers , how come all that ? " " Where 's your imagination , kid ? Let 's suppose , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben to meet him . " The usually smiling face had gone severe , as  | if the mind behind it saw circumstances as they had been . " Now the man , whoever he was , would n't want to have it out with Ben in front of Marcy Belle and the kids . Hell , no . They 'd be witnesses . So the man dared Ben to meet him on the road where the mailbox is at . Ca n't you see it , kid ? " " So far . " " Ben was n't one to take a dare . Do n't you believe it . Though he did n't make it this time , he always figured he would come out on top , one way or another , overhand , side-arm or underhanded . That 's why the sneakers and that 's why he sneaked . " An old , held-in hate showed naked for a minute through the bland shine of his eyes . " Apologies to my mother , but Ben was , always was , a low-down , sneaky son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , " I said . Mike Day drew a breath and fixed a smile at the end of it . " Sorry , kid . " The eyes turned innocent as onions . " Talk too much , but it 's something you might think about . " I thought about it , walking along . I thought about Mike Day in particular , Mike who could explain how it all happened . The strange car that Guy Jamison saw could have been one that Mike rented and later returned to the place where he 'd left his Cadillac . It could be , but other situations argued against my telling Charleston , who would probably dismiss my suspicions again . - Felix Underwood stood in the door of his funeral par- lors , waiting for business . He asked me , " Ready for Sun-day ? " " No . Seen Terry Stephens ? " " Working out on a ranch , so I hear . " I went to the Commercial Cafe for a Coke . I was the only live one there , if ten cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star , for nothing , which is just what I saw . At home I gathered up three worn baseballs and threw at my old barn-door target , threw hard too soon and had to shag a bunch of wild pitches with an ache in my arm . Then Mother called me to lunch . My father lighted his pipe after we 'd eaten and , sizing me up , said , " You seem out of sorts , son . " " Yeah . " " What 's the trouble ? " " The sheriff 's cleared the decks , and me along with the clutter . " My father considered and said , " I see , " and blew out a wondering breath of smoke . Mother put in , " I do n't . Why would Mr. Charleston do that ? " " I believe you clear the decks for action , Mother , " my father told her . I said , " That 's my guess , with me out of it . " " If you mean danger , " Mother said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " " But I do n't want to . " My voice had risen . " I 'm not going to if I can help it . Do n't you see ? Ca n't you understand ? I 've been in on the case since the beginning and be damned if I 'm shuffled out now . " Mother said , " Son . "  | " All right . Son this and son that , but I 'm old enough to know what I 'm doing ! " My father said , " We hear you , Jase . Please do n't yell . Just tell us what you propose to do if , in fact , what you suspect is true . If the sheriff says no to your presence , what can you do ? Or we ? " " No is no , " Mother added , her face drawn with an anxiety I did n't appreciate . " I 'll find a way , " I said . My father kept puffing his pipe . His words came out along the stem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He took the pipe out of his mouth and his eyes away from the smoke . " Also , son , we have confidence in you and good reason for it . " He turned to Mother . " It may be , my dear , that we overdo the business of thinking of Jason as our little boy . Mothers incline to do so and fathers , too , I suppose . But he 's almost eighteen , soon subject to the dratted draft . " Mother began to cry . Through her hands she said , " Please ! " " Compared to what may face him soon , " my father went on , " what is this small episode ? And in view of his age has he not the right to some choice ? " " Not if the sheriff has his way , " I said . " I am coming to that . I will write Mr. Charleston a note . It will give our permission for you to accompany him . More than that we ca n't do . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protestingly , and I left home full of heart but did remember to kiss my mother , who said in my ear , " Oh , do be careful , my son . " I thought of my mother as love and my  | father as sense but not with the full appreciation that was to come to me with the years . The question was whether to show Charleston the note now or later , at what might turn out to be the decisive moment . I decided on later and so loafed around town , making frequent excursions to the courthouse to be sure that the Special was still in its parking space . Not until along about four o'clock did I enter the office . Halvor had come on duty early , and Charleston was reading a book , The Immense Journey , which sounded like some kind of adventure story . He looked up from it to say , " I thought you were taking the day off . " " I thought maybe I would write more on my report , " I answered , hopeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a hm-m and returned to his book , and I walked into the private office . My report was there but not the excerpts he had hand-copied . The Savage stood in a corner . I picked it up and looked it over . It was a working model with a steel butt plate , stamped SAVAGE QUALITY above and below an Indian-head outline which together constituted the trademark . A good light rifle , though discontinued . A good rifle once . Why had n't the most recent user run a cleaning rag through it ? Why had n't Junior ? I listened for the ring of the phone , suspecting Charleston was waiting a call . Why else sit there in office hours reading a book ? Twice , when the phone did ring , he answered at the first buzz . One call , I gathered , was from Monk Fitzroy , his out-of-town deputy , and was no more than routine . Apparently the second came from a house- holder who had just discovered the fridge had been raided . I heard Charleston mutter , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town marshal . " I waited , rifle in hand , doing nothing . Then the phone rang again , and Charleston said , " Yes , Mabel . Thanks . Remember , under the hat , " and there was quiet again . And still I waited , waited until I heard Halvor go out to get grub for a couple of offending drunks who would be released once they 'd paid their hangover penalties . Then I could n't wait any longer . Charleston glanced up . " You still here ? " he asked me as if I should n't be . " Still here . " I added , feeling brash , " Waiting , like you . " He smiled then , but yet as if to dismiss me , and said , " Reminds me somehow of a maiden lady in my old town . She swore she would n't die wonderin ' , but she was sixty-four at the time and died two years later and left the rest of us wonderin ' . Maybe that 's us , Jase , forever wonderin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone jingled again , and Charleston seized it and listened and said into it , " Good . Good . And thanks . I 'll see you shortly . " He got up then , full of purpose , and told me , " lase , I reckon I 'd better borrow your fingerprint kit . " From a drawer of his desk he was pulling the prints already taken . " Sure , " I answered , " but borrow me along with it . Are n't I your print man ? " " Sorry , boy . "  | " But wait ! Look here ! " I brought from my pocket the note signed by my father and mother and handed it over . I knew by heart what he was reading : Dear Sheriff Charleston , Reluctantly , but at his insistence , we agree that our son , Jason , may accompany you in your investigations if you want him to , this with no risk or liability to yourself or the county . For us to deny him , we feel , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With faith in your judgment . Sincerely , Charleston frowned , reading it and for a long minute afterward , and my breath blew shallow . He said , " Oh , goddammit , Jase , nothing 's going to happen , nothing violent and maybe nothing at all except I might make a fool of myself . " " Yes , sir , " I answered and held up for his decision . " All right , then , " he said finally . " But you stand aside . Hear me ? Completely aside all the time . Take your baseball along and do n't interfere . " It was plain enough that he was n't pleased , but I answered gratefully , " Yes , sir . I promise . I do . " I got my baseball and kit , and he took up the fingerprints and for an instant seemed to think of buckling on the six-shooter that hung on the wall but voted against it . Halvor came in with the prisoners ' grub as we were about to surprise that he turned off on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look on it as a flyway , which birds of the law and other assorted fowls followed . The wind of yesterday had long since blown itself out , and we jolted along to the blessing of a sky without clouds and a lowering sun without blister . It was hard to think that hereabouts in such peace and quiet , with the ribbon of the river winding along to our left and the grand rise of the mountains ahead , murder had been done . There was plenty of time for such observations , for Charleston said not a word all the way . It was to my surprise that Charleston turned into the Powell Hawthorne place , but I did n't comment or question . If he wanted to play mummy , let him . I would stand aside , as ordered and promised . The friendly dog greeted us , and Geet came out , her hair touched by a whisper of breeze , and gave her hand to Charleston and then to me . Her face had that clean , open , somehow pitiful look that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did n't take you long , " she said , smiling . Charleston was carrying my kit and I my baseball , and he answered , " Hi , operative . Thanks . " " She led us into the lodge room , where Professor Hawthorne rose and shook hands , his welcome moving his beard . " So you 've located my rifle , " he said as a statement of fact . I had thought the .303 was a secret , shared only by Charleston , Junior and me , but I kept silent as befitted a stander-aside.  | " And I am led to suspect ? but wo n't guess ? that you have a suspect , " Professor Hawthorne continued . " Unnamed , " Charleston told him , speaking from his chair with a little wave of his hand . " Right now we hope you 'll let us fingerprint you . " Professor Hawthorne took a long time in answering while his eyes measured Charleston . Then he ventured , seeing or knowing more than I did , " For verisimilitude , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth . " " Have it your way , " Charleston answered , his grin showing his teeth . " Also , a man feels supported if he has some sure-enough facts underfoot . What 's more , a public servant has to act even-handed , else he 'll get kicks from behind if he 's wrong . " " Ah , yes , " Professor Hawthorne said . " By all means take my prints . " " lase . " I took the kit and did the best job I could , and while I was doing it Charleston sat back and talked . " Our office is n't much . Not up to date . A haywire operation by modern standards . No real communications system . No lab at all . We just bungle along . " " Muddle through , the English would say , " Geet threw in . " The muddle ' is right , the through ' is questionable , " Charleston replied . " Underfunded , every bureaucrat complains , but underfunded we are . Otherwise these murders , maybe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | " Not by Mr. Gewald , " I dared to put in , speaking for almost the first time . " There are few substitutes for horse sense , " Professor Hawthorne said . " Without it , what use are systems , electronics , computers ? " " I think Father is betting on you , " Geet told Charleston . " Faith is the word . " Charleston , always discomfited by praise , hitched in his chair . " Thanks , but I 've never seen it move a mountain . " I was done with the printing by that time , and we , meaning Professor Hawthorne and me , proceeded to clean up . Charleston got up and looked out the window and then consulted his watch . " Time to go , I guess , Jase . Oh , but first , Mr. Hawthorne , will you sign your name to the prints ? " I put my stuff together and saw through the window that the day would soon fade off into dusk . We were six weeks or more past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be an hour , maybe more , before a man could distinguish a star . Outside , Geet said , " Good luck . Let us know . " Charleston answered , " Why , sure , " and walked to the car , the fresh prints in his hand . It was my day for dumb astonishment . Just short of the river bridge Charleston turned right , toward the small patch of land owned by Dr. Ulysses Pierpont . Notrespassing signs , big , red and newly erected , introduced the trail to his trailer house , which was parked close to a  | stunted jack pine and seemed as alien to its surroundings as a painted igloo . Dr. Pierpont came to the door and , seeing us , jumped down the steps and charged out as if to give the boot to invaders . Then , recognizing us or the Special , he held up . Charleston commanded me , " Remember , you stand aside . " He pushed out of the car , the whole collection of prints in his hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carried a good smell from the door , like potatoes frying with onions . Charleston said , " Good evening , Doctor . Hope we 're not interrupting your supper . " Dr. Pierpont returned the greeting , not mentioning supper . He stood waiting , a picture of cool and competent professionalism even in an unbuttoned shirt and old slacks . From the west the half-sunken sun shed a red glow . " We need your cooperation but wo n't keep you long , " Charleston said . " You see , the murder weapon 's turned up , the one that killed Hogue and Day , and it happened to have some good fingerprints on it . " " Is that so ? " Dr. Pierpont answered in the tone of a man who believed that it was n't . " Yep . Lots of metal on a Savage three-oh-three . Butt plate , lever and trigger guard , breach housing . The man was careless or else thought our dinky office could n't lift prints . " " What has that to do with me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , no more than with all the others . I 'm taking fingerprints from everybody around . Routine for me , so the county will have some excuse for  | my wages . " He fanned out the fingerprints . " See . Here 's Buster Hogue 's prints , signed by himself , and Old Man McNair 's and Guy Jamison 's , and just now I took Mr. Hawthorne 's , signed by him , too . " Dr. Pierpont said , " Nonsense . " " Probably so . It would take a miracle to match up any prints with the prints on the rifle . " " Charleston paused and said in another tone , " All the same , I want your prints , Doctor . " Still the cool and capable professional , Dr. Pierpont answered , " It is an insult , an insult to my known standing and to my profession , an insult to me as a person . " " But you do n't mind , Doctor ? " " I object to the exercise of petty authority . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that harder , that slow-cutting voice , " but your refusal would look mighty funny . Yours alone . That news would shock the profession . " I thought Dr. Pierpont would continue to balk . He looked at Charleston , his face cold and set like that of a man weighing insults . Then he said , " You give me no alternative . Let me turn down the stove . " It was time to turn it down . I could smell onions scorching . " I 'll bring the kit , " Charleston said to his back . He made for the car , waving me off as I started toward it . Then two scenes appeared , right and left , and grew into one . Charleston came from the car , the kit in his hand , and Dr. Pierpont stepped from the trailer house , an automatic pistol in his . " Get off my property ! " Dr. Pierpont said , moving the  | pistol for emphasis . " Get off , you and your boy ! " Charleston halted . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracy . Get off ! " " What conspiracy , Doctor ? " " You 're paid by it . Wealth . Arrogance , Power . Position . " The words came out distinct , separate , charged with cold certainty . " Like Buster Hogue 's ? " " I said get off ! " " Like Ben Day 's ? " " Not Ben Day . Get ! " Dr. Pierpont lifted the pistol . " By God , " I heard Charleston say , " if you 're not a madman ! " That one word burst on me , like daylight seen when a blind is jerked up . Madman ! The body fixed , steady in purpose , and the voice controlled but with ice in it , the ice of conviction , of righteousness , or certain grievance . The automatic , pointed , did n't waver . I knew Charleston would n't retreat . He would walk into that gun . And I knew Dr. Pierpont would fire . Charleston took a pace forward . The pistol fixed on its target . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Pierpont said . " It seems you have noticed . " Then my hand felt the ball , waking my mind . No time for a windup . Rear back and fire . I aimed for the head . The ball went wide . It hit the gun and the gun hand and knocked the hand down but left the gun in it . This much I saw as I ran . I swung for the jaw . The pistol jerked around and met my fist . It went off . Then , deafened , slammed back and down , I scrambled  | on the ground and rolled free and saw Charleston , on his knees , strike at a face already bloodied . He struck again . I heard myself cry out , " Sheriff ! " It was with a wrench , like breaking out of a spell , that Charleston left off , picked up the loose pistol and climbed to his feet . Dr. Pierpont did n't move . He was out . " All right , Jase ? " Charleston panted . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed you , and , son of a bitch , I told you to stay out of things . " There was anger in his voice yet , and I answered , " Yes , sir . Then he smiled the smile that was never far from his face and touched my arm , " You 're a good boy , Jase . Thanks .
