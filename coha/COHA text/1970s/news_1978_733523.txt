Even now , Colson was preparing to speak about his new life as an ex-convict bringing Christian ministry to inmates of federal prisons ; but his audience was waiting to ask him about his old life , and how his job as special counsel to former President Nixon got him into jail in the fir  --  t place , The crowd lining up Thursday morning at the WGN-TV studios , for Colson 's appearance on the Phil Donahue Show , wanted to know about Colson 's role in Watergate , Those in the crowd who had read excerpts of Haldeman 's books , ' : The Ends of ' Power , " wanted to know why Haldeman portrays Colson so negatively .

" He insisted he read it only because he was commissioned to review it ; and he said he is tired of Watergate " and everybody in it pointing fingers at each other . ' WHY , THEN , he was asked , is he here ? Why does he do television shows where he 's certain to be bonged with questions about Watergate ? " I 'm here because I believe deeply in the work we 're doing for prisons and I want to talk about it , " he said . He 's a Close-up member of Prison Fellowship , a national ministry group that has received government permission to visit federal prisons , preach to interested inmates , and train volunteers in " Christian disciple. ship .

" The show was on , and host Donahue had plenty of help from the audience , Questions poured out . In response , Colson said he did n't recall Nixon ordering him to " get the goods on O'Brien ; " never tried to blackmail Nixon ; never taperecorded their conversations ; had sent a telegram to Larry Flynt , " born again " Christian and owner of a pornographic magazine who was hospitalized by an assailant 's bullet ; and had visited Haldeman twice in prison , written him letters , and still prays for him .
