n the ' country they call " The Savior " it has been difficult these past few years to be a peaceful man of God . Catholic priests have been / murdered in El Salvador , a voldanic mini-republic in Central America . And during last year 's Presidential election , a right-wing terrorist group ( terrorists do not all belong to the Left ) , calling itself " The Union of White Warriors , " threatened to kill all the Jesuit fathers living and working in the country . In El SalVador , there is a head-on collision between the government , controlled by rich coffee planters , i and the Catholic Church which is today the country 's only effective legal opposition.iThere is also an extrale-gal opposition in the shape of a guerrilla movement which of late has made a number of spectacular kidnappings ( and one assassination ) of foreign businessmen whose employers have had to pay large ransoms , partly to the guerrilla movement and partly to The New York Times and other newspapers for ( publishing guerrilla manifestoes in huge , unreadable advertisements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic priests are unlikely revolutionaries  --  or at least they were in the-Latin America of earlier days , when peasants knew their station and the churchmen considered it their main task to I provide the sacraments as magical rites among Indians who , saw little difference between the Church and their ' ancient pagan ways . In those days , too , the ChUrch was a trusted ally of the landlords , the oligarchs . In the past decade , after Pope John XXIII's- " Populorum Progressio , " the Second Vatican Council , ' and the 1968 meeting in Medellin , Colombia , of Latin American bishops , things have changed a great deal , and not only in El Salvador . ( See " Pawns and Bishops ; Torture , Murder &; a Church Divided " by Penny Lernoux , The Nation , September 30 . ) " The Church in Latin America used to be pre-Christian , almost pre-Abraham , " says Father Miguel d'Escoto , a Maryknoll priest who spends most of his time actively trying to end the dictatorship of the Somoza family in'El Salvador 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Loyola , were alive today , he would not spend his time trying to influence ' the powerful , " says Paco Estrada , former head of the Jesuit organization in Central America . " If Loyola had Bjorn Krim is a Swedish free-lance radio and , print journalist wha has reported extensively on African and Latin American affairs . He-recently toured-El Salvador . been our contemporary , he would have sided with the people , We can not go on telling the peasants to be humble and wait for rewards in the next world . We have to tell them : Organize ! There is strength in unity ! " It is small wonder  --  when even Jesuits talk like political activists  --  that the men of power in El Salvador , the men whose fathers built the big coffee plantations and are now themselves diversifying-into industry , feel that their whole world is threatened . " There are priests in this country who talk as if they were Fidel Castro , " says Ernesto Rivas Gallont , secretary general of the Salvadorean Association of Industries ( and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . " The priests are telling the peasants that everything should be distributed equally . They divide the world into the good ones and ' the bad ones . They side with the peasants . They consider us the bad ones . " El Salvador , so small and seemingly insignificant that it was called'el pulgarcito , " the tiny thumb , by Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral , has been a tight dictatorship for the past forty-seven years . There was a peasant uprising in 1931 , " the first Commtinist revolution in Latin America , " says Mr. Rivas fearfully , but it was much less violent than the ensuing repression which cost the livesof some 30,000 people . The general who saw to that massacre then had himself elected President and ruled for the next'decade and a half . The oligarchs on the coffee plantations thought it convenient to let the military run the government and maintain necessary repression , while they themselves concentrated on making money . So solid was the power of the coffee men that El Salvador is the only country in Central America that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Fruit Compp.ny , ' the imperialist specter of the area . Even , today , U.S. companies find it difficult to get a toehold in the country . The Salvadorean oligarchs are very much in charge of the national economy and tend also , in recent years , to keep tighter control of the military , which they have delegated to preside over the political order . The government 's candidates regularly win elections in El Salvador ; last year many people did not get to vote at all , since the ballot boxes , mysteriously , were filled to the brim long before the election booths opened . A current joke in El Salvador tells of how President Carter , the Pope and the incumbent Salvadorean President , Carlos Humberto ' Romero , found themselves together in a boat to small for all three . Each , therefore , had to make the case for why he should not be the one to jump into the shark-infested sea " I am the President of the most important country in the world , " said Carter . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the Pope . " I am the greatest democrat of all , " said President Romero , " but let 's vote " ? and he won by seven votes .

They are given some military training ( the govern'Tient hesitates , however , to give them guns ) and told to keep tabs on possible revolutionaries in their areas , especially union organizers and Catholic priests . One of the Salvadorean priests murdered last year was Father Rutilio Grande , a mild-mannered ' Jesuit ish of Aguilares , . With two of his n his 70s , Father achine-gun fire noon to celebrate ears at seminar- , often in great nsider himself a lleagues of more radical views , he arrived in Aguil res in the early 1970s and found that his task in the area almost ' amounted to missionary work , preaching the gospel all over again to peasants who had been left on their own by the priests , except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services at bap-tisms , marriages and funerals . " The peasants around Aguilares are living under medieval conditions , " said Father tutilio . " They are serfs under their landlords . The wealthy cope farmers of El Salvador have ceased4being Christians . It is not our Lord they are praising hen they get up in the morning . They cross themselves in the name of their lord , Coffee . And when they hdve prayed to their lord Coffee , then they pray to their lord Sugar . " Prophetically , Father Rutilio referred to the land-owners in the Aguilares area as his " brothers Cain , " but kept praying for their souls . Six months after he and his colleagues started their work in the parish , a major strike hit the sugar plantations , organized by two radical peasant organizations with Catholic links . The Jesuits protested that they had not actively or-ganized the peasants , but to the landowners the very fact that these priests were different from the clergy of729 the past  --  that they relied on lay people to carry out evangelizing work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one understood , and ' refused payment for the sacraments  --  was , enough indication of subversive activities . And the Jesuits were preaching the need for the peasants to organize . A couple of months after Father Rutilio 's death , the army moved in force to occupy Aguitafes and expel the remaining Jesuits . Aguilares was kept under occupation for eight , days . Every house in - town , except the minuscule co-operative store ( which ; had some international backing from the Scandinavian-financed Latin American Institute of Co-operative Ii-qegration ) was ransacked , the soldiers looking for Communist literature and in some instances seizing .

However , the Easter procession - this year , usually carried out in absolute silence , was disrupted by the soldiers , who fired over the heads of the participants . In El Paisnal , silent men with machetes and handguns tucked into their belts watched as ' I nervously asked for the key to the Church . It is a simple building in whitewashed adobe ; , up front , near the altar , were the ' three graves where Father Rutilio and his two friends are buried . The silent men were almost eel- , tainly members of Orden , under instructions to keep ' an eye on the peasants and farm workers and to watch out for foreign agitators  --  among whom the regime includes Catholic priests . It would be difficult , however , to include Archbishop Oscar Romero of the See of San Salvador among that crowd of foreign agitators and revolutionaries who , according to the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church as a front . Archbishop Romero ( no relation to the President ) belongs to an old aristocratic Salvadorean family . He is a true member of the country 's oligarchy and was considered right wing in matters of state and Church when he was appointed Archbishop in 1976 . A rchbishop Romero is an intensely private man who suffers a great deal from the public stand he has been forced to take during the past two years . He says that he would prefer to make his protest by withdrawal , by keeping absolutely silent . But circumstances do not permit . The death of Father Rutilio , his close friend , seems to have been the turning point for the Archbishop , who has literally become the voice of the opposition in El Salvador . , Every Sunday morning at eight o'clock the giant cathedral in the country 's capital is so packed that the congregation spills out onto the sidewalks . The former Cathedral burnt down a few years ago , under mysterious circumstances , and the present structure is hardly impressive , looking like a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new building , but the Archbishop seems uninterested in architecture . " He does not consider it his task to erect buildings , " says a Catholic nun in El Salvador . " What the Archbishop is really doing is building the people . " Every Sunday morning , the sermon of the Archbishop , the unwilling leader of El Salvador 's opposition , is broadcast from the Catholic University station . It thus reaches into the smallest villages , and makes itself heard even to the poorest farmers tilling the soil at the very rims of the Volcanoes . The Archbishop does not mince words . Sunday after Sunday , he has been lambasting the regime , accusing his fellow oligarchs of being bad Christians who use violence to impose , their will on the people . " We are seeing the ugly face of our historyi " preaches the Archbishop . " It is not the Church which is sowing the seeds of violence . Violence is the fruit of unjust laws which benefit only one sector of the population . If the Church is trying to change things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keeping true to Christ , this is not communism , it is Christian justice . Our Savior taught us that you must lose you ? life in order to gain eternal life . That is the dialectic of the Church . " But , " adds the Archbishop bitterly , " these men who are ruling us do not want to lose anything at all . " Archbishop Romero thinks it is , likely that the government will intervene and slap a ban on his sermons . However , until he is silenced he will go on preaching and presenting to the public the testimonials of peasants who were evicted from their houses and their December 30 , 1978 bits of land during the clashes between Orden and the peasant organizations . Making their way over the mountains , the roads being blocked by the army , hundreds of peasants and their families reached the Archbishop 's office in a seminary in San Salvador . It , is doubtful that they will ever be able to go home . They will add themselves to the hundreds ' of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countryside , in effect , help the landowners to modernize agriculture , as well as rid themselves.of agitators , " says an observer . " The coffee men made lots of money during the past few years ' coffee boom . They need fewer workers on the land , and the population is increasing steadily . But they might need thetm in the towns , as cheap labor for their new tax-free industries geared for exports . Our oligarchs have always been able to adapt to new circumstances : " For a little while , the Salvadorean oligarch was running scared . Many members of the leading families ( they are popularly known as " the fourteen , " but are in fact somewhat more numerous ) moved to Miami where a number of tl'em have bought expensive condominiums . Now they are returning . They still wdrry about the Church and its revolutionary pfiests , but are heartened by the growing presence of U.S.-financed Protestant missionaries .
