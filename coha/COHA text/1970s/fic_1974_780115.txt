 | Now that her husband had a pretty new wife , he did not need her so much . Sheep , a few goats and extra horses moved with them , some laden with the Indians ' only belongings ? the supplies they would use to set up camp when they reached their destination . An intangible feeling of fearful expectation rode with the group . They were traveling into enemy country , the territory of the hostile and cunning Navajo . One year before , in 1864 , Colonel Kit Carson commanded a troop that was responsible for gathering seven thousand of the Navajo tribe to Bosque Redondo , near Fort Sumner , New Mexico . Aware of the banishment , some Utes and Paiutes were migrating towards the Navajo Mountain area , though they were also aware that there were bands of Navajos around Hoskinnini Mesa that had evaded the roundup , and that the Navajos would not hesitate to rid their land of invaders . Chipeta looked at the towering sandstone cliffs around them . They were traveling south through Copper Canyon , southwest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuge . She wished they could have remained at Paiute Farms where they had wintered the previous year , but the land was grazed out and their nomadic blood pushed them onward . Other families from Elk Mountain had already gone to Colorado . Chipeta 's father was afraid of no one and was anticipating adding the vacant Navajo land to the Utes ' already spacious territory . He knew it was a good winter area and with Elk Mountain for summer grazing for their stock and game , his family would have an easier life during the coming years . Despite Tse-quit 's lack of fear , he was cautious . As they moved he listened carefully to every vibration the earth had to offer , his keen eyes searching the walls above them . He knew it was dangerous to travel the canyon bottom , but their need for water demanded it . Reflecting , he was angry because of the group 's insistence on campfires the previous night . They were soft ; they would n't eat raw meat or sleep in the chill . They were afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but were more concerned for their own comfort . Tse-quit spat on the ground , " Foolish people ! " What was done was done , though ; now he had to protect them from the consequences of their own stupidity . Summer rains had washed away any traces of habitation , so there were no signs of life , and yet Tse-quit felt an impending evil force . He  | could almost smell the Navajo and wondered if it were silent , live enemies or the presence of the dead . Indecision weighed upon his mind for the first time since beginning their trek . Tse-quit raised his hand to halt the group to council when he heard a whisper like a bird swooping by , and felt a deep , throbbing pain in his chest . The arrow had gone deep into his heart . An instant , seeming to go on for eternities  --  the whisper echoed deep into his mind as his hand dropped and he fell from his horse . Chipeta had been watching her father , wishing he would turn around and lead them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it entered her father 's body , swift and silent , but it seemed to rip the canyon quiet , tearing the silence into a thousand pieces of terror . In panic the girl 's first instinct was to run . She could see four Navajo warriors descending from nowhere and as she dug her heels into the pinto 's side , a cry rose in her throat , " Mother ! " Mother was with Grandfather and would not leave him . There was no time . Chipeta spurred the pony in the direction they had come . The path was blocked by two Navajo men who had slipped in behind them from around the knoll . She could see the excitement in their eyes . They were crazy with a thirst for adventure , a craving for revenge . Where could she go ? Death 's hand was very near , and she felt the stroke of an arrow as it flew into her pony 's flank . Dread blacking her vision , she kicked the pony again . He stumbled , caught his balance , then raced for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aware of some of the other men falling from their horses . She had heard stories of warring parties and she knew what would happen to the women after the men had been killed . She thought again of her mother and her mind exploded in horror , but she could not go back . Death would be easier than living with the truth of knowing , but she could not go back . The side canyon was small and steep , red rocks jutting skyward . Red , red , red . Red blood , red sky , red canyon ? a box canyon , with no way out . In a final attempt at escaping , Chipeta searched the canyon walls and found what she was looking for . Sliding from her horse , she ran up the side of the canyon towards a crevice in the wall , barely large enough to crawl into . Without a thought of what else the niche might contain , Chipeta crouched deep into a corner , trying to hide from the light . The pounding of her ears subsided and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children . It seemed that they all . f- ' , , '  | should he dead . Surely her escape had taken much time , but no , it was only minutes . The Navajo men were yelling , laughing . What was happening ? Would they kill all of the party or take them as captive slaves ' ? Chipeta hurt so inside . She was filled with a feeling too large for her small frame . She wanted to cry , but there was a rough dryness in her throat that prevented it . She bent and vomited . The screams were subsiding , being cut off one by one until only the pitiful wail of a small baby remained . The wood on the cradle board cracked as it was broken , and Chipeta bent her head and sobs racked her body , but still the tears would not come . She held herself tightly , trying to overcome the evil sickness that I i lied her . In the back of her mind , she heard the sheep and goats bleating and the horses moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen her come this way . They would come after her ; they could not chance her returning to the Utes and becoming a witness against them , telling of the massacre . Her people would then try to destroy the few families left in this part of the Navajo nation . Chipeta heard the meaningless sounds of an unrecognizable language , and saw three men moving about below her . One man shouted as he saw her struggling pony and a grunt of triumph escaped as he was able to end its misery . Navajo men were taller and slimmer than Ute men , though no more agile . She thought the men handsome , a curious thought for one who should by all rights hate them , but her emotions were gone . She seemed numb . Chipeta realized the men knew of her whereabouts now , and could hear one moving toward her hiding spot . She did n't move . I do n't care , she thought . Kill me ! Kill me ! The man 's frame filled the opening as he stopped and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't want to die . Love for life engulfed her and tears came with the return of emotion . Her enormous brown eyes filled with shimmering drops that fell to the red dirt below her . There was silence as the young warrior studied the beautiful face framed by the white robe , then he dropped the bow and motioned her outward .  | In the distance Chipeta could hear a coyote howling . When she was a small girl her mother had told her why the coyote cried . " One day , time since before now , Coyote chased his children deep into a hole . It was a chipmunk hole , just small enough for Coyote 's children , but Coyote could n't follow . Coyote rattled a stick in the hole to make them come out , but the children ran far underground and then rose high in the sky and became stars . " Chipeta looked upward at the cluster of stars she knew were Coyote 's children . The coyote howled again and she felt the desperation in the animal 's wail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she brushed them away . Crying would not help . Coyote 's children would always be stars , and she would always be with these strange new people . Winter and spring had come with the days since the Navajo brave had brought her to his hogan . It seemed forever , and her loneliness betrayed her desire to forget the past . All her loved ones , the days with them she cherished so deeply , these valuable moments had been stolen , leaving only the empty nothingness that each new sun brings after a sleepless night . Time had not yet dulled the memory of her family 's cruel deaths . The Navajo men delighted in describing each minute detail , and the spoils they had returned with ? sheep , goats , horses , fine buckskin clothing , dried meats and fruits . The enchanting Ute girl 's presence proved the story true . Tales of the massacre would awe generations to come . Chipeta was now carrying the child of Nistsxaaz , the tall Navajo who discovered her in the cave . He had taken her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no announcement . Simply because he found her and chose to spare her life , she belonged to him . Nistsxaaz was a good man and she had come to accept and love  | him . She also recognized that by destroying the Utes , the Navajos were only protecting that which was theirs , but she did not expect to ever understand the savagery induced by war . ( ' hipeta felt someone 's presence and turned quickly . A girl was standing behind her , her face hidden in the shadows . " You must come in , it is too cold outside . " It was Eva , Nistsxaaz 's daughter by his first wife who was now dead . Eva was living with her father 's second wife , Litso , and her three daughters . Nistsxaaz had arranged Eva 's betrothal and she was to be married in the fall . She was a consolation in Chipeta 's loneliness . Ofttimes Eva called Chipeta " Chi , " the pet name given her by Nistsxaaz . In Navajo it meant cherish . Only Nistsxaaz and Eva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this endearment . With Eva 's aid , Chipeta rose and started for the hogan . As she walked slowly toward Nistsxaaz 's home , she felt the babe kick within her and she stopped momentarily , resting her hand on her swollen abdomen , the wonder of such a miracle as was life portrayed in her rapturous face . For her unborn child 's sake she became determined to turn her back on her previous home , Elk Mountain , and be content to move toward Navajo Mountain , the direction the clan would be going shortly as they moved to their summer homes . And so it was for her child that Chipeta had unselfishly accepted a new way of life . It had been a hard time for Chipeta , learning a new language and new customs . The hardest part was trying to understand Litso , the woman Nistsxaaz had married for her family 's wealth . Litso , as a second wife , had accepted Eva 's mother and her position as first in the husband 's heart , but she could not accept this pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Litso , not a " cherished one . " Her feeling of jealousy had become a cancer , growing until she was filled with an intense hatred . The hatred was continuously fed by Nistsxaaz 's open affection for his third wife , something seldom expressed publicly by the Navajo . Litso felt it improper to show emotion in any form and envisioned how the other men must laugh to themselves at such a display . In truth , Chipeta was highly regarded among the clan by all the men . Like the appraisal of a good horse , they viewed her with assentive  | nods . Nistsxaaz was envied for his priceless possession , a feeling of which he was not unaware . Trying to combat Chipeta 's attractiveness was impossible for Litso . Knowing she could never equal Chipeta , she tried to lower her rival 's standing . Litso insisted the girl keep her braids and buckskin clothing instead of wearing the traditional Navajo bun and woven garments . She whispered lies about the girl to Nistsxaaz , but her husband only shook his head , aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy the girl , the more Nistsxaaz ignored the cruel woman . It was an endless battle with no victor . One night , in desperation , Litso pushed Chipeta into the cooking fire . Had Chipeta been wearing the Navajo dress , she might have been badly burned , but the buckskin protected her and the act was of little consequence . Litso was patient ; the way to their summer camp was steep and rocky , and there would be opportunity . The warming days and joyous songs of the birds announced the return of spring . The Navajos believed the bluebird to be a fortunate creature and knew the summer crops would be successful due to the abundance of the magnificent songsters . It was time . The Navajos were packing , preparing to move into the cooler regions of the highland . Mothers shooed away persistent children , so they could work steadily on , gathering and sorting their possessions . Chipeta 's heart was filled with a peace that spread through her being , lighting her features with a smile and putting stars in her dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her radiating happiness . Laughing , teasing children played around her , as did the cool breeze . Soon her child would be playing with these children . She fingered the necklace Eva had given her . It had a small , notched shell to show Chipeta 's desire to have a boy . She was anxious to give her husband the son neither of his other two wives had given him . The horses could carry no more and so each woman and child was assigned a bundle and the procession began . Coming out of Paiute Canyon on the twisting narrow trail toward Navajo Mountain seemed to take forever . After toiling up the steep side for hours , Chipeta looked downward where they had come , and was amazed that they had pro- gressed that far . She was very tired , her face showing her discomfort . Recognizing this , Nistsxaaz debated with himself as to what would be best . He wished to let Chipeta rest and catch up with the group later , but he could not stay with her , nor could Eva , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had no choice . Turning , he called Litso to his side and commanded her to remain with the Ute girl . Litso smiled in delight at the opportunity . Nistsxaaz did not catch her expression or he would not have left Chipeta . Chipeta watched this exchange but was not afraid of the yellow woman . She merely did not understand her . She wondered if by being alone they might have a chance to know each other better . Chipeta relaxed and enjoyed the coolness of the shade . The continual motion in the hot sun had made her feel queasy and brought sharp pains to her stomach . She did not recognize the warning signals ; her baby was not due for two more full moons . Then the pains came harder . Her abdomen was becoming tight and then was soft again . Litso was sitting a short distance away ? plotting , like the enemy she was ? when she heard Chipeta cry out . Perplexed , she struggled to her feet and approached the juniper under which Chipeta lay . It took only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The group had moved on and she could not go for help even if she wanted to . Circumstances demanded she help this girl she hated by delivering the baby of the man she loved . She could not do it ; she would not help . The pains would not have been so intense except for Chipeta 's fright . Beforehand , thinking of the baby 's birth , she had been determined to be brave , but it was not time and the baby was coming . What was wrong ? She seemed to be losing control over her body . She was a spirit apart ? floating away and returning . Her mouth was parched from gasping for breath . Now her body was awaking from a deep sleep , tingling all over . She lifted her head and touched her face , but there was no feeling . Then she was gone again , bearing down , trying to push the child from her womb . As Litso watched , she became frightened . She had helped with deliveries before , but instinctively she knew something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to come . She realized this was what she had waited for for so many months ? a chance to destroy Chipeta . If she did not help now , both Chipeta and the baby would die , and no one  | would or could blame her . The older woman 's shoulders drooped in indecision . She looked at the girl writhing in pain , and knelt before her . In a moment instinct took over and the hatred drained away . She helped turn the baby and support Chipeta as it was born ? a man child , a purplish , wrinkled , squalling baby son for Nistsxaaz . The baby 's cry was strong for such a tiny creature . The older woman had not known before such a peaceful feeling , a feeling of accomplishment . She had taken a step up in the world . She had helped give her husband the desire of his heart ? a son . Tears streaked her face as she held the newborn baby and viewed the minute perfection of the life she had guided into mortality . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new fear Litso realized that the girl was quiet and unmoving , gray shadowing her face .  | Nistsxaaz was worried . Night had fallen and his women had not yet come . Eva joined him , her eyes expressing concern . Without speaking , they mounted and rode in the direction they had come earlier . This was new country to the powerful Navajo man . Many past summers he had spent in the canyons to the south and to the east of the mountain , but now several families were joined together , seeking the solitude and protection the sacred mountain offered . The soldiers had swept the vast Navajo land , taking the people in small groups . By considerable effort , Nistsxaaz and his group had evaded every search party . Had the Navajos banded together , Carson and his troops would have found a different enemy , but they were content to remain undetected . The night held dangers for any traveler , especially women in unfamiliar country , its mysteries often revealing themselves after the covering of dusk . Nistsxaaz was apprehensive and could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His people would never be safe , even in the most remote of canyons . Maybe the soldiers had stumbled on their trail and overtaken the two women . Litso pushed together some branches and bark she had stripped from a cedar tree . Tearing her underskirt for a soft covering , she tenderly wrapped the tiny baby , and placed him on this for a bed . Then turning to Chipeta , she did what she could to make the girl comfortable . Chipeta opened her eyes to the flickering firelight and the heavy fragrance of burning cedar . Her breathing was shallow , for she was tired , very tired . It was a supreme effort to focus on her surroundings . Night pressed in on the glowing circle of light , the moon still resting on the rise of a hill . A breeze tossed the defiant , springy grass , its touch reaching Chipeta , cooling her aching body . She seemed to sway with the moving grasses ; indecisively , a pendulum of pain swung her earthward and then back toward the dark sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby . Her mind awoke , becoming aware of her surroundings . Litso was stooped over her , kneading her abdomen as she would press out a cornmeal cake . Without stopping , she smiled at the girl , relief lighting the dark features of her face . " You have a son , " Litso answered the question in Chipeta 's eyes , " a fine son for Nistsxaaz . " A surge of happiness engulfed Chipeta , sweeping over her , then leaving as the throbbing pain again took control . She tried to rise to look at the child , but could n't find strength to lift her head . A distant sound tugged at the quiet of the night . Anxiously Litso turned toward the direction of the noise , wondering when help might come . It was past half-night when Nistsxaaz and Eva reached the area where they had left Litso and Chipeta . As they rode , Eva could n't help noticing , even with her anxiety , how the stars were each visible in their own setting , displaying a majesty that overcame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the horses came into the firelight , Litso rose to meet them . She was numb with weariness . The lines around her mouth and eyes had deepened , and yet there was a new look about her , a glow reflected by the firelight that softened her harsh features . Nistsxaaz was puzzled and curious about the difference in his second wife , but the cry of the baby quickly brought his mind to other matters . So this is what had delayed them ! He deftly slipped from his horse and hurried to Chipeta 's side . There was fondness and pride in his eyes as he tenderly viewed his lovely wife . She nodded her head , a warmth creeping over her , gradually chasing away the chill that had been causing her to shiver . She raised her hand slightly and Nistsxaaz clasped it to his breast , his emotions preventing the question he so desperately wanted to ask . Chipeta understood , and a shy smile preceded the words , " Our firstborn child , Nistsxaaz , our son . " Nistsxaaz looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled into a tight grimace and a lusty cry accented Chipeta 's announcement . The father felt a pride so filling as to obliterate a desire for words , words which would have been wasted , for the baby was crying so loudly now he drowned out any other sound .  | Chuckling , Nistsxaaz stood and returned to Litso 's side . He smiled into her eyes and waited for her response . " Chipeta has suffered bravely to give you the desire of your heart . She is very tired and very weak , too sick to care for the child herself . The baby should be taken to someone who has already a child , but can still care for another . " We must take the baby to the camp tonight , but Chipeta can not be moved at least until tomorrow , and only then by carrier . " Eva 's eyes met her father 's . They could not comprehend the change in this woman ? her deep concern for the girl she had openly despised only a few hours before . " Litso , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in his . " You have saved Chipeta 's life and helped bring my son into our world . " The rest remained unsaid , but Litso knew she had made a start toward regaining her husband 's affection . It was hard to comprehend the complete transition created by her change of heart . Eva asked to stay with Chipeta while they took the baby on to the camp . Litso gathered the infant in her arms , handing a wrapped cloth to Nistsxaaz . Inside the cloth was the umbilical cord , which , according to custom , would be buried beneath their sheep corral to insure the boy 's capabilities as a shepherd . With her husband 's help , she mounted Eva 's pony and moved off into the night , talking to Nistsxaaz of Chipeta and her strength that defied death . Sometime later , she would have to tell him of the inevitable : Chipeta would never be able to bear another child . Chipeta loved their summer home . As she lay on her bed day after day , regaining her strength , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocky protrusions were light red , yet soft and glowing , like a sunset that enclosed the camp with a beautiful , quiet feeling , like the peace one experiences as the dusk hushes the world after a harsh , dry day . There was a unity in the people here that she was unaccustomed to . They shared and exchanged food and clothing freely in time of need . The clan , in total , had adopted her son and cared for him in her sickness . She was grateful and pleased with these people . Daily , as her strength returned , she took walks into the wooded  | area by their camp , carrying her son on a yellow buckskin cradle hoard . She grew to relate to the earth , its soil sending flowers and cactus to meet the sun . The earth was like a good man , like Nistsxaaz , sharing from within with those who loved and cared for it . Northwest of the camp was a small spring they carried water from . Beyond the spring , Chipeta discovered a small knoll from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day while there , she gazed at the patchwork below , seeing where the Colorado and San Juan Rivers had cut a path deep into the rock , joining forces at one point to become even more forceful . The Henry Mountain was to her north , and in the northeast stood Elk Mountain , overwhelming the surrounding hills . Something stirred deep in her heart and expanded . Home . Where her people had lived for generations . Home ? Where was her home ? Who were her people ? Her family had been destroyed , yet her son had been created . In confusion she tried to sort out her feelings , tears welling up in her troubled eyes . Why had fate demanded the deaths of her family ? Effa , Chipeta 's mother ? how she longed to have her here to see her grandson . Emotion twisted inside the woman-child as she rocked the sleeping child 's cradle board . She was Ute , yet by accepting the Navajo way , she had been treated fairly . Why not then her family ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now created wonder at the disharmony among men . What was the purpose of these pretended differences ? Why could n't men of all tribes join together in peace and forget past wars and their causes ? Leaning against a rough sandstone protrusion , she cried until there were no more tears . These were problems and thoughts of generations past and posterity to come . She could never begin to comprehend a solution , but must she remain in such an agonizing , powerless state ? Below her , an older man named Atsa worked among the green plants in his garden . He moved slowly , weeding and banking the soil for irrigation purposes , lovingly tending the corn , squash and melons . What good will it do him ? Chipeta thought in weary defeat . And then she realized that this was her answer . She could not change the way of all men any more than the old Navajo man could prevent the enemy elements from working on his garden , but she could care each day for someone , implanting her desire for harmony with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that first she herself must learn the way of beauty with the people , the creatures of the earth , the land ; then , by example , perhaps she could influence others as to the uselessness of destruction , and the value of walking in beauty . Even if no one else cares , she thought fiercely , I will teach my son these things , that he may walk in greatness and understanding . Then , with her sagging spirit renewed by this resolve , she carried her son down toward home , the distance between her and Elk Mountain growing greater with each step . She was ready to enter this new phase of life willingly and totally .  | Chipeta lay sleepless in the stuffy darkness of the hogan . Most of the time she spent the night beneath a shade , or even out in the open , but tonight it was raining heavily . It was the first moisture they had had in days ; a welcome rain that would release the parched land from the dry , brittle dominion of the sun . Tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangments for Eva 's wedding . The groom was of the Dziltltade Clan , the Foothill People . They lived south of Navajo Mountain in Navajo Canyon , almost fifteen miles from Nistsxaaz 's Many Goats Clan . She and Nistsxaaz would have to leave very early to complete their journey before nightfall . It would be a hard trip , so Chipeta would have to leave their son here with Litso . She sensed that Nistsxaaz was awake , but she could not speak to him . He seemed a stranger this night . The rain seemed to isolate this moment in time , dragging it into eternities . Would this night never end ? Yet she did n't want it to ? tomorrow must not come . She admitted to herself her fear . She was afraid to face strangers . Would Nistsxaaz be ashamed of his Ute wife ? It had n't been long since Chipeta had resolved to neglect the obvious differences between tribes . This was n't an impossible dream , but she realized the hardest convert would be herself . Resolutely she moved closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day dawned cold and gray . Nistsxaaz and Chipeta ate a small breakfast before leaving the secure warmth of the hogan . Out in the morning air , Chipeta shivered , more out of apprehension than cold . She was leaving her son and journeying to a strange place . She knew she did not have to mount the mare . Nistsxaaz would understand , but he was counting on her . With a half-smile , half-grimace , she lifted herself to the horse 's back and , shivering again , bade Litso goodbye and bent closer to the dappled pony for warmth . The mare 's breath was visible in the chill . Each hoofbeat echoed sharply in the crisp air . A small breeze tossed the cold back and forth , promising as the day continued to grow into a full-scale blow .  | Nistsxaaz had been counting on the wind . He kept to the flat rock as much as possible , but the horses ' hoofs cut deep into the intermittent sand and it was important that their tracks be covered . The gale would dry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chipeta despised the white force from the place called Washington . She had never seen a white man , but believed they must be overwhelmingly large and powerfully vicious to create such caution in her brave husband . This feeling of stealth bothered the young Ute woman . It brought thoughts to her of last night and of the day on the knoll . Why must men fear men ? The beautiful Chipeta was not unaware of life . Certainly hers had not been sheltered , but she had been blessed with a gift of acceptance . It was difficult to understand those who were stubborn and rebellious . Chipeta was still frail , her body not having built up the strength she had lost when her son was born . This weakness caused her to tire easily , and she dozed now , her sleep unchallenged by the movement of the horse . Barking dogs awoke the girl as they made their way down an incline towards the camp . The wide canyon extended for miles in front of them . There was plenty of grazing and farming area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-hidden oasis in the desert . Behind the dogs ran curious children , delighted at strangers . It was beginning to storm again ? not rain , but large hailstones . The children who had been excitedly following them ran for their homes . Hearing their arrival , the father of the intended groom came out to meet them . One of his sons took the tired horses , and the man led Nistsxaaz and Chipeta into his home . Chipeta was ravenous because they had not taken time for lunch . She ate heartily of the haniigai ( boiled corn ) and the pinion nuts . There was goats ' milk to dip the nitsidigio ( bread ) into . While she ate , she was aware of the curious stares of the family group , though no one said anything . She laughed inwardly at herself for foolishly being afraid of these people . What reason would cause them to hurt her or be unkind ? Nistsxaaz visited with Aniltso , the man who was bigger than his name implied . Their faces were intent as they discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a sad thing that has happened to our people . " Aniltso shook his head . " The great White Nation wants our land , our homes . When we try to keep what was our fathers ' , we are punished . Many of our people , many of my family are taken away . Where have they gone ? " Nistsxaaz gravely contemplated his answer . " Some say they are driven into the sea . The soldiers will take us , too , if we are not careful , and drown us with the others . " Chipeta was shocked at his answer . She had no idea that the Navajos were ignorant of the fate of their brothers . Unthinkingly she moved forward , closer to the men . " The People have been taken far away to a place called New Mexico . They live in holes in the ground . " She drew back , suddenly ashamed of herself for being so impertinent . Aniltso ignored her incongruity . " Do you know more , little one ? " " No , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are never to return here to their old homeland . " There was a sorrowful silence . Holes in the ground ! Living like weasels . It would be better to be drowned in the great sea . The men moved onto the subject Nistsxaaz had come to discuss . They bartered into the night . Aniltso was a wealthy man for these times but , almost in fun , he offered only eight horses for Eva . Nistsxaaz frustratedly pointed out the girl 's good qualities , insisted she would make a good wife . Finally , in compromise , Aniltso made a gift of eleven good horses , including a large , powerful red stallion , to the father in exchange for his daughter . They decided the wedding should be in fifteen days . The time did not seem long enough , but at last the preparations for the wedding feast were made . The women had been busy all day grinding browned corn for the alkaan , the ceremonial cake . Eva was understandably nervous and in an effort to make her feel better , Chipeta proudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this knowledge only increased Eva 's apprehension . With the water boiling , Litso added the cornmeal slowly , stirring it  | with a cornmeal stick . She added a little honey , a rare treat , for sweetening . A pit was dug and a fire built in it . When it was heated through , the ashes and embers were raked out and the pit lined with several layers of corn husks . The mush was then poured in , covered first with husks , then with hot earth from the pit . A fire was built on top of the pit to bake the cake . The cake would be cut ceremonially and given to the guests after the wedding . The next morning Chipeta helped Eva dress in her finest clothing . She had a wool blouse of deep scarlet , and a full , light yellow skirt with several flounces . Her clothing was ornamented with many rows of silver buttons and she was wearing heavy silver bracelets and rings . Chipeta viewed the pretty young girl and smiled her approval . This was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be losing the companionship and love of her friend . Eva was to return with her young man to live with his clan . It was an unusual and critical step , for , by custom , the young man should remain with his wife 's family , but the People were on the defensive and the clan of Eva 's betrothed had too few men , so they had requested his return . Litso called to the women , telling them it was time . The groom 's family had arrived . Chipeta embraced the young bride , and they walked toward the hogan where the wedding would be held . Eva carried a wedding basket which contained cornmeal mush . The basket was made out of dried sumac twigs which , when burned to the roots , would grow back instead of dying . This symbolized eternal endurance of the marriage . She entered the hogan where the groom was already sitting , put the basket before him , and sat down at his right . It was an impressive sight : All the members of each family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The couple , who had never before seen one another , seemed pleased at each other 's physical appearance . The wedding basket was woven in a pattern that had a dark , serrated band surrounding a plain space in the center and enclosed by a plain border . The dark band was not a complete circle , being left open at  | the scam . This seam was placed facing east . Nistsxaaz sat beside the bridal pair , holding a basket of water and a ladle . He also held a bag of corn pollen . It was his duty to direct the ceremony , which would be performed by his brother , the wealthiest man of the two clans . He handed the ladle full of water to Eva , which she poured over the groom 's hands as her father washed them . Then the groom , in turn , poured the water over her hands as Nistsxaaz washed them . Eva 's uncle took the medicine bag from her father , opened it and took a pinch of pollen out . He drew a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south to north , and finished by encircling the mush near its edge with a line of pollen . The bridegroom , Shash , then took a pinch of the mush at the place where the lines met at the eastern edge and ate it , Eva following suit . In like manner , pinches of mush were taken from the south , west , north and the center . Afterward the basket was passed to those relatives attending the ceremony . Nistsxaaz turned gravely to the couple . " This will be a hard life that you are entering into . Shash , you must protect Eva and provide for her . Eva , you must do as you are told and give Shash sons and daughters for his posterity . " Aniltso , in turn , talked to his son and new daughter . " You must both rise with the sun and work hard . Do not become lazy or jealousy will enter into your lives . " The ceremony complete , the relatives gathered around the couple , buzzing with hard-learned advice . When Chipeta 's turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own and looked tenderly at her friend . " Be happy and look for the good in your companion , Eva , and you will find love . " More needed to be said , but words could n't pass the large barrier that had built up in her throat . With eyes moist , Chipeta quickly squeezed Eva 's hand and turned to leave the room .  | The clan was preparing to return to their winter home . The summer 's wealth was carefully packed atop already heavily laden horses . The load included dried foods of the area , and colorful corn , still on the cobs . Everywhere the camp was humming with anticipation , the dark-skinned children racing back and forth collecting treasures from their summer hideouts . When all the families finally grouped together and became organized it was mid-morning . The slow line moved up the rocky hill , past the gully and across the point . It was exciting for the children to be on the move . Their parents were greatly relieved to at last be underway . Nistsxaaz and his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , but the people looked to him for guidance . His wisdom equaled their trust . Aniltso had given him an earlier warning of white soldiers in the area , so he had two men scouting in the canyons directly ahead of them . The sun rose higher in the sky . Over the rough trail onto Paiute Mesa , the tired horses carried their burdens . The children were becoming tired also . Their excitement worn down , some of the smaller ones were crying with thirst . Finally , in mid-afternoon , they reached Nakai Canyon , where a small clump of pinion trees provided shade for the children to rest while their mothers spread out the meal they had prepared that morning . Nistsxaaz was gnawing on a piece of venison jerky and playing with his son when he saw a cloud of dust in the distance . It was Kai , one of the scouts , riding full tilt . As he came over the hill , it was obvious he had been working his animal . Nistsxaaz frowned at his lack of concern for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve horses , maybe more , down in Copper Canyon , " the excited man was shouting , his words almost incomprehensible in his loudness.  | Nistsxaaz reached for the reins of the dancing pony . " Tracks are not so important , Kai . What kind of tracks ? " " Fresh , maybe one-half day , maybe less . The horses have shoes on their feet ! " He held up a battered horseshoe found on the trail and laughed hysterically in his urgency . " Where is Atsa , Kai ? " Kai was immediately on the defensive , his excitement turned to anger . " Still out ! I could n't find him , so I came back alone . " Nistsxaaz spoke softly , " I told you to make contact with Atsa before returning . " The rider bowed his head , embarrassed . " We were separated . I do n't know , maybe the soldiers have captured him . " Lifting his head , his eyes flashed with anger . He had come back with an important find , and he was received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Nistsxaaz . " I thought you would feel my news more important than waiting for Atsa . " Nistsxaaz tried to control his anger . He knew Kai was not a brave man , nor brilliant , but he had hoped Kai would at least be able to follow orders . The tracks were an important discovery , and if this man were not exaggerating , they were faced with a serious problem . They might have to go back to the mountains for protection , but first he must find where the troops were heading . He could not take chances with his people 's lives . The surrounding area was rocky and steep . Nistsxaaz searched the mesas and buttes , straining to find a cave or any spot of safety . As though his intense gaze had bored a hole in the rock , there appeared in the distance a small opening , almost hidden by shadows from the overhanging cliffs . Mounting his horse , he rode towards the cave . At one point he lost it completely in the surrounding camouflage . The opening was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes to grow accustomed to the darkness , then crawled inside . The ceiling was almost thirty feet high in spots and there was a natural opening to one end that allowed a shaft of sunlight to filter through . The cave was damp , and as he studied the dimensions of the  | large room , Nistsxaaz became aware of the sound of water . A small underground spring dripped unceasingly down the side of the sandstone , disappearing into the floor . The man could not desire a more perfect refuge . He nodded his head in a pleased way . The people were restless , almost to the point of becoming hysterical . They had overheard parts of the conversation , enough to frighten them , and now their imaginations dwelt on fantastic theories . When Nistsxaaz returned , ordering them to take their belongings and go to the cave , they almost stampeded in their urgency to be gone . Nistsxaaz raised his hand and halted the panic-stricken group . He was angry , but was n't sure on what to blame his feeling . " Litso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the cave . The men must help me in locating a place to hide the horses and sheep . Take care to cover your tracks , and remain there quietly until we return . " The movement was organized and the livestock was herded into a grassy box canyon a quarter of a mile away . There was no water near ; but there was no time to locate a better corral . Perhaps they would not be here long , anyway . Nistsxaaz took four men with him and rode in the direction from which Kai had come . They were on the defensive , carefully observing the signs of the day . Kai was the only one who was not wary . Riding out front , he felt he had regained his importance by having the other men follow his tracks . After several miles , and several long discourses between Kai and what must have been the sagebrush ( no one else was listening ) , the riders realized that they had been riding in a circle . Nistsxaaz took the lead in silence and they rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon they came upon the tracks . Nistsxaaz studied them intently . The white soldiers could be circling Monitor Butte , going around to Paiute Farms , or they could be taking the trail east around No Man 's Mesa , and traveling towards Nakai Canyon , where the clan was . If this were true , it would be a distinct possibility that they might spot the group . He deliberated as to what would be the best action to take .  | Kai was waving his arms wildly . " We must follow these tracks , these ponies with shoes , and kill the white soldiers who ride them ! If we do n't , they will find us and kill us , and take our women and children as slaves ! " Nistsxaaz was irritated at the ignorant man . He was skittish as a goat . The powerful leader snapped his quirt in the air and silence fell with it . " For three years we have avoided the white man . They do not know of our existence . By killing them , others will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain undisturbed . " He clipped his words , knowing they were wasted on Kai , but sensing that the others were perhaps thinking along the same lines , Nistsxaaz strove to disqualify Kai 's fears . He had no sooner spoken than a rider appeared from around a group of large boulders . It was Atsa , his face lined and tired . He was breathless with exertion . " I found these marks early this morning . I followed them around to the side of Monitor Butte . They look like the soldiers are headed for Paiute Farms . I never caught up with them . " Nistsxaaz spoke his approval of the older man , while Kai smoldered in the background . Then Nistsxaaz told the men to return to the rest of the group , while he followed the white soldiers and found just exactly where they were going . " I will go with you . " Atsa was not asking ; he was stating his intentions . Nistsxaaz grunted his dissent . Taking a gourd of water from one of the other men , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hesitation , the group followed his orders , returning to Nakai Canyon . If Nistsxaaz had not returned by the next night , they were to continue their journey homeward to Copper Canyon . The group waited longer than they had been instructed . Atsa had moved into command and was quite sure that Nistsxaaz would be back by daybreak on the second day . When he did not return , the group departed from their hideout . The sun struggled to lift itself high enough  | to give them warmth and light , but a cloud cover on the horizon refused to give up its position . Atsa sent two scouts out ahead , wishing that Nistsxaaz would return and take command . Chipeta and Litso were equally worried about their husband , and the day seemed much longer than it actually was . Their eyes constantly scanned the distant hills . The sun had pushed away the clouds and was high in the sky by the time the group looked down onto the canyon floor of their winter home . The area was undisturbed ; nothing had trespassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The families unpacked , scattering to their individual hogans . As they labored , a strange quiet came over the earth . The people stopped working and listened . There were no birds singing , no animals stirring . The silence was heavy , suffocating , weighing down on their minds and souls . Angry with the sun 's impertinence , black clouds marched from behind the mountains and rendezvoused , uniting until the land was as dark as if it were night . Lightning burst the sky open and the thunder escaped , growling from one height to another , waiting for the lightning to split the sky again , so it could return . Nistsxaaz rode into camp just as the first large drops of rain fell . He had caught up with and followed the white soldiers until he was sure they would not return to the Copper Canyon area , then had ridden swiftly home . He tied his stallion to the sheep corral , then lifted the bulky Spanish saddle from its back and turned toward his hogan . A brilliant flash of lightning blinded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body . He heard his horse emit a strange gurgle . Rising slowly , he saw most of the sheep and his stallion sprawled on the ground .  | Chipeta ran to the hogan doorway so fast that she stumbled through the blanketed opening at the crackling sound of the lightning and its accompanying clap of thunder . Relief at seeing Nistsxaaz safe overshadowed the despair over the dead horse and sheep they viewed together . She was eager to hear of his journey , but exercised patience as Nistsxaaz ate of the food Litso prepared for him . He told them he had been beyond Paiute Farms , following the white soldiers . In answer to the question Chipeta had stored away for so long , Nistsxaaz described a white man . " They are quite the same as we are . They dress different ; their hair is cut in a funny way ; and some of them looked shorter than me . " " But why then do we fear them ? They sound quite harmless ! " ( ' hipeta was perplexed and disappointed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms how to hold a rifle . " All they do is press on the bottom and BOOM ! a round ball of fire throws a piece of steel from the gun like an arrow from a bow , only much more powerful . " The excited women were enchanted with his experiences and asked many more questions . The storm in the background added mystery to the stories . Finally he raised his arms in protest . " I am very tired . I will rest now . " Outside , the sky had broken and was falling in an attempt to drown the wind . The rain came like warriors throwing spears . Hard to the ground it fell , savage and heavy , but bouncing again into the new drops sent from above . In the darkness of the hogan , there were a few muffled sounds , but silence reigned for the most part . The falling rain drummed a monotonous tune , accented by the now-distant thunder . Tiring now , it was losing its voice . Litso 's youngest girl was rocking back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creak of the wood expressed a new  | danger . The soil had washed away from the unrepaired sides of the old hogan , soaking the cedar bark chinking between the wood frame , thus adding a new burden to the old timbers . Nistsxaaz became aware of the sagging roof . " Move to this side quickly ! Grab the blankets and corn ! " His family was swift to obey his command , but they were too late . The wall caved in with a heavy thud , covering their winter food supply , bedding and extra clothing . Exposed to the raging storm around them , though unhurt , the girls wailed with the gale . Nistsxaaz moved quickly . Taking the cradle board from Chi and an armful of blankets , he instructed the women and girls to carry what they could and follow him . Kai lived closest , but Nistsxaaz knew the greasy man would have no room for them ; his hogan already held his wives and an overabundance of children . Atsa lived over the hill to the right . Atsa 's family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the family made their way across the dark hill , Nistsxaaz looked back at the sheep corral . His horse had fallen on the fence posts , knocking down one side of the corral . All of the frightened sheep who had not been killed by lightning were gone . The tall Navajo grimaced . It would n't do any good to search for them in this violent assault from the heavens , but he would have to go out as soon as the storm was over . Atsa lifted his blanketed door at their call and welcomed them inside to the warmth and quiet of the hogan . His graying wife took the screaming child from Nistsxaaz and tried to comfort him while the women disposed of their burdens at one end of the hogan . The family was very frightened . This new terror was something they could not combat , something the elements had brought upon them . They huddled in the hogan , shivering in their wet clothing , trying to find rest through the long night . Morning brought a new world . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered in the chill , Kai strutted among the people professing that it was the gods who had brought the ruin . He claimed loudly that if the men had destroyed the white soldiers , the gods would have blessed them rather than bringing this curse .  | The loss of the sheep , coupled with the diminished food supply , weighed heavily upon Chipeta . Her son had felt the fear of his mother last night and had cried himself to sleep , sobs racking his small body . She was fatigued this morning and felt numb as she gazed in wonder at the changes around her . The desert , unaccustomed to so much rain , after having drunk its till , rejected all else . The overgrown creek bed carried debris and occasionally a dead animal drowned and washed from its hole . The swift currents washed away or flattened the grass they had counted on using for winter grazing . The colors of the land were bright and gaudy in their newly washed form . Chipeta saw where two large streams came together with new force and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One stream was a light brown color , coming from the east ; the other , from Copper Canyon , was a deep red . As the colors gracefully merged , the single force was a beautiful hue . I will tell my son of this , Chipeta thought . In looking for good it can he found . From the storm the two streams became more powerful and then more beautiful by joining . Two races of people can become the same way , blending into one purpose in peaceful coexistence rather than fighting for the upper position as when at war . The men sent the children after the sheep , then set about gathering materials to build Nistsxaaz a new hogan . They put three large fork poles into the ground at the north , west and south points of a circle , the forks interlocking . Two poles were laid against the interlocked forks from the east to form an entryway . Then the men interlaced poles to crown and fill the spaces and worked sticks , bark and grass into the smaller holes and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rounded top . Nistsxaaz smoothed clay over the earthen sides and roof to repel the winter moisture after the other men left to do the same to their own homes . They had just finished when it began to sprinkle again . The women hurried to gather in the still damp blankets and food set out to dry . Chipeta could never remember such a long winter . The dried fruit that had been salvaged soon began to rot in the prevailing damp . The  | sheep herd was so diminished they dared not kill any for food . On the few good days , the men hunted , fished and dragged floating limbs out of the distant river for firewood , but the good days were in short supply . Chipeta wondered if the clouds would never go away . She was sure the sun was dying and soon they would be left in darkness . One day Nistsxaaz was hunting for deer down by the San Juan River . He did not see anything except for a beaver , which he shot and brought back . Chipeta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beaver 's entrails across the underside and then after pulling every last bit of fat and flesh from the hide , she pounded the skin until it was soft . The furry pelt made a fine robe for her young son . She wrapped him in it and took him outside to watch the other children . It had snowed heavily , laying almost a foot on the ground . The children were reveling in this unusual occurrence . They climbed atop woolly sheepskins , and slid down the hills on the slick side , then scrambled up to fall over each other in their hurry to gain the hilltop for the next ride . They had a gay time , forgetting for a while the hunger that gnawed at their stomachs . Chipeta and her baby laughed and clapped their hands in delight at the brown children playing in the snowy white world of winter . Watching them , Nistsxaaz was overcome with a warm , wonderful happiness , so intense it was almost a pain . One rainy night , Nistsxaaz was depressed and discouraged . None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering at the conditions that had befallen them . Now Chipeta was sick and there was no medicine man for miles . There seemed to be nothing anyone could do for her . He sat beside her and contemplated their misfortune . What had caused this ? Burdened by these thoughts he lay on the sheepskin for long hours before falling into a deep sleep . Nistsxaaz was no longer in his hogan with his families , he was on a large plain where the four corners of the earth were visible . There was no snow , no cold , no hunger . He could not see the sun , but there was light and a warmth all around him . Others came to him out of the haze of the ground ? his friends . There was his brother , Aniltso , and Atsa , with nine other leaders . They were in council . They talked of the contentment and happiness of the People . There was no jealousy or criticism . They were self-sufficient , with no need to raid or kill others , but only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were  | confused , as if their knowledge had been stolen . No one could plan or progress . The men cried , " What happened ? We ca n't think ! We ca n't plan ! " " Then Coyote , symbolizing the human who was appointed to help the people , came to them and saw the state they were in . No knowledge , no understanding , no wisdom . He told them what had happened . " If a person becomes a leader and takes upon himself too much pride , he is in danger . When you begin to progress and become prideful , you 'll lose your position and your mind because of your haughtiness . " Coyote turned to the twelve leaders and said he knew who had stolen their knowledge . " If you will appoint me , I 'll go east , west , south and north and find that knowledge , understanding and wisdom and bring it hack . But first you must do something . " The leaders turned to Coyote . " What can we do ? Can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " I need only four things : a white shell which represents the rain ; turquoise which represents wealth ; corn pollen which represents the immortality of man ; pearls that represent the blessings that will be restored to you . " The leaders laid these articles at his feet and Coyote took their tokens to find Skunk . Together they went east , west , north and south and finally returned in seven days . Skunk had dug up the people 's knowledge for Coyote and then sprayed the area so no one would come near until the elements appeared undisturbed again . Coyote told the leaders , " It will be twelve generations before this knowledge will be completely restored so you can understand . Things will go smoothly for a while , then at the end of the twelfth generation there will again be a lot of confusion and all the nations will speak one language , but they will differ in what they say . Everyone will want to rule the world . This will be a time of wars and tribulation . The holiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those who have retained the family relationship , those who can still pray . " Nistsxaaz woke with the sun . He was left with a strange feeling from his dream that would not shake itself off in the light of day . It was more than a dream ; it was a vision . He had heard of such things , but had  | never before experienced such a feeling . He knew he must instruct his people of the vision and its impact , but he must first understand its full meaning . Would Coyote or the good person that Coyote copied be able to bring an end to their misery and restore things to the old way ? If so , when ? A slight hope was born in Nistsxaaz . Maybe this vision was a sign that the Navajo could return to their land without Carson 's soldiers keeping them in New Mexico or wherever the big holes in the ground were that Chipeta had told about . But if they did return , who was to say that trouble would n't follow ? Trouble has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . But then , so does beauty have brothers . It must depend on who we choose for a companion , trouble or beauty . Nistsxaaz looked at Chipeta still asleep in this new day . I know this , he thought , beauty came to me when I found Chi . What then can trouble bring that we ca n't overcome ? Chipeta stirred as if she felt his eyes , and her movement brought the first sounds from their son . A new day , a new beginning .  | It was late summer 1868 . After two winters of near starvation , the Navajos were looking forward to a generous harvest from their farms at the base of the mountain . The increase of their flocks was evidenced by the many lambs now nearly as large as their mothers . They were joyous in t heir prosperity , but not forgetful of their past misery and difficulties . The people found solace in the wisdom of Nistsxaaz as he , in turn , gained strength and courage from the gentleness and understanding of ( ' h i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together for an exchange of companionship . Nistsxaaz reveled in the riches he had ; not material riches , but spiritual gifts of love and harmony within . This night they were gathered around a comfortable fire , a hub in the scattered hogans . Nistsxaaz held his squirming son on his knee . The people were waiting for their leader to begin , to tell them of the fall move to their winter home . Oblivious of the others , addressing the boy he held , he said in a grave tone , " Someday , my son , you will become a great chief . " The people accepted his words as though they were the words of a prophet , for were n't the words of this strong man always true ? He had spoken to them before , telling them to remember the ways of their fathers , to be self-sustaining and not to harbor grudges or a prideful attitude . They had found happiness in following his counsel . Surely their gods had also been pleased ; the soft summer rains and abundant crops proved this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed older this night , for indeed his hair was graying , though his voice seemed stronger as each year passed . Voice stronger or the clan 's ears more attuned to his words , it was the same . Beside Chipeta , who lent a youthful and graceful air to her husband 's years , he looked quite as he was , a strong leader of strong people . Nistsxaaz spoke , his words ringing clear in the night air . " We have had many problems , many heartbreaks . We must always be watchful for  | white soldiers and enemy tribes who wish to take our land from us . My brother is now watching the trail to scout ahead of our annual trip to Copper Canyon . " This is the land of our fathers , the land where we were born . We must keep this land . " His eyes seemed to look right through his people . They quieted , almost holding their breath in anticipation of the story they knew Nistsxaaz would tell . " Long ago , many of our people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many by the Spaniards . They had nothing , and yet they were happy . They were happy because , although their bodies were slaves to others , their minds and hearts were their own . " There are problems in life ; sickness , death , losing our crops and animals , losing our friends . " Nistsxaaz thought sadly of his friend , Atsa , who died last winter of pneumonia , and faltered with emotion . " Yet we are wealthy . Wealthy enough to be concerned about poverty . " Perplexed , the listeners ' eyes never left Nistsxaaz 's face as he continued . " There is a poverty ? poverty in the heart . Death would be easier to bear . " His words were heavy and intense . The people unconsciously drew closer to him , like hungry animals to a feast . " When this exists , the people are unhappy because they show hatred to others , they refuse to have anything to do with their brothers unless it will benefit them . They speak false words , they like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their neighbors . Jealousy : they try to pull others down by criticism in order to lift themselves up . They gossip and spread lies about their neighbors , even those they call friends . " This kind of person has no prayer on his lips , no peace or friendship with those who know him , no love . He has poverty in his heart . " Nistsxaaz emphasized his statement by placing his fist on his left breast and bowing his head . There was a long pause before he again spoke . " We can not become lazy . We have worked hard this summer to bring up crops from the earth . We have many riches in our hands . We must have love and then there will be many riches in our hearts . Our Navajo people will return to their land and we will become a great nation . " Nistsxaaz rose to his feet and walked away from the group . He was  | perplexed and surprised at himself . He had not intended to tell the people of the return of the Navajos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not his thoughts ! His thoughts had been on preparations needed to move to their winter home . ( ' hipeta left the surprised and murmuring group and joined her husband , who was preparing to go relieve his brother who had been scouting for soldiers or other trespassers who might be close to Copper Canyon . Chi set her son on the dirt floor of the hogan . He half-walked , half-ran crookedly to his father . With his fist tightly closed and put over his heart he asked , " Chief , me chief ? " Nistsxaaz lifted the handsome child into his arms , enclosing the small fist in his own . " Chief , " he repeated solemnly . The child , who had not yet been given a name , was delighted . He scrambled down and ran outside to his half-sisters who were walking slowly toward the hogan . " Chief , me Chief ! " Chi looked into the twinkling eyes of her husband , and smiled at him . He returned her gaze as if in a trance . This was an angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal , for her kindness and love surpassed all understanding . He left the hogan , quickly saddled his horse and rode into the black night . The trail into the canyon and onto the mesa was steep and treacherous , but Nistsxaaz 's mustang was swift and sure-footed . His brother , who had been gone for two days , was very glad to be relieved and able to return home . He gave his report , " I have seen nothing but buzzards above and lizards below . This morning when I awoke there was a lizard and horned toad sleeping with me . I would rather go to bed with my wife . " He laughed at his joke , then sobered . " We have n't seen any soldiers for over a year , now , Nistsxaaz . Perhaps they got a big bug and all died . " Nistsxaaz shrugged his shoulders . " I 'll check the south trail before returning . " He said nothing more , and the shorter brother , sensing a different mood , left Nistsxaaz to his thoughts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Chipeta 's company , as he always did when they were apart . He missed the warmth of her body , the soft whispering caresses she shared with him at night . To be without her was to be without food and water . He was thinking of her when a movement caught his eye . In the distance were several riders and other objects moving slowly across the desert . He strained to try and make out the forms , but could not tell who or what it was . How long had he been lost in thought as these figures came on and on ? His people were in possible danger . Cursing himself for his daydreaming , he worked his way carefully across to the next knoll to get a better view . He was sure , because the figures were not all mounted , that they were not soldiers . But he was still wary . It might be a large group of Utes or Paiutes . Even if it were Navajo refugees , it was cause for concern , as they had to move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close and showing signs of overgrazing . Nistsxaaz decided it was indeed Navajos , but where from ? He returned to his horse , mounted , and made his way down the valley . He circled the group , then seeing they were unarmed , rode cautiously up to them , raising his arm as a sign of peace . He dismounted and walked toward the bedraggled group of men , women and children . As he was recognized , the tall Navajo could never remember such a glorious welcome . Tears came to the eyes of these Navajos as their aging leader stepped forward and put his hands on Nistsxaaz 's shoulders , " We are home ! " Nistsxaaz had failed to recognize Bi tah ni tso , the headman of the Bi tah ni Clan . The Dineh had returned !  | As the evening fire burned low and the red coals cast shadows on Bi tah ni tso 's face , he said , " Nistsxaaz , you are aware of our heritage as a people , and I know you lived an honorable life before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years , it appears our land is still unused by the Mericats or other foreigners . I have seen a map or picture showing where the Navajo can live . It does n't allow us to claim this land for our own . The map shows only a small area will be given hack to the Navajo . After many nights of talk about what to do , we decided to return here to our home , even if it belongs to someone else on paper . The soldiers may come again to take us back to the reservation , but until they do , we are home . " Others of the weary group had silently gathered as Bi tah ni tso and Nistsxaaz talked , and seeing opportunity to teach the younger members of his clan , Bi tah ni tso went on , telling again the well-known legend of the creation . " In the first world there was darkness everywhere . Four oceans surrounded the Underworld where the Insect People lived . There were four chiefs at each ocean who governed the people of their area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , but soon they began to quarrel among themselves , until Tieholtsodi , the chief of the east , said they must go elsewhere to live . The water began rising from the four sides , and to escape drowning the people went in circles , up , up , up , through a hole in the sky . " They came to Second World , a world that was blue everywhere , and the only inhabitants , other than themselves , were the Swallow People . They lived in happiness for twenty-three days , until jealousy grew between the newcomers and the Swallow People and caused the people to again seek refuge elsewhere by climbing to the sky and through a slit , which was the opening to the Third World . " This world was yellow , like the sunshine , and there were many Grasshopper People who lived there . They joined with the people and became as one family . But soon they were again asked to leave because  | one of the newcomers made free with the wife of the Grasshopper Chief . " Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher , around and around until with the help of the holy ones they reached the Fourth World , which was black and white . " This land had many great snow-covered mountains at the four cardinal points of the earth . Couriers went south , east , north and west . At the south point there were only tracks of deer and turkey . The east and west had no signs of life , but the couriers who went north found a race of people called the Pueblo . They lived in houses in the ground and cultivated the fields . The Pueblo fed them and treated them well . The people lived happily and prospered in this land . It was here that First Man and First Woman were created . " One day Coyote , the mischief-maker , kidnapped the daughter of Tieholtsodi , the Water God , and kept her beneath his robe , which he wore day and night . Out of revenge , Tieholtsodi brought on a great flood . The people escaped by climbing a tall reed and going through a hole in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World . " On the fourth day they could see that the water had risen to the top of the hole through which they had come . The men gathered in council to discuss this problem . First Man said , " Coyote has never removed his robe in eight days , not even when he sleeps . I suspect he has stolen property hidden under it . " They tore Coyote 's robe off of him , and the small daughter , who looked like a buffalo calf , went through the hole into the water . The water subsided back into the lower world , taking the child to her father . " The Holy Ones took sacred earth brought up from the underworld and made four sacred mountains . One was Tso Dzil , Mt . Taylor ; one was Sisnajini , Sierra Blanca Peak ; one was Dook'o'osliid , San Francisco Mountains ; and the last was Dibentsaa , Mount Hesperus . All the land contained within was given to the offspring of First Man and First Woman . " Pausing for a moment , Bi tah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This land has been given to us by authority beyond what Washington has , and must be treated with respect . We are to take proper care of this home and not forget to give thanks for such a beautiful land .  | " In the beginning we lived in harmony with the earth and in peace with each other . We have observed and learned from our neighbors . Some of us have intermarried with these tribes , as there were originally only four clans , and it is forbidden to marry within one 's own clan . From the Pueblo Indians we learned to weave and farm . Then the Spanish came , determined to conquer the land . They destroyed the Pueblo strongholds , while the Navajos , which were then a large and powerful nation , retreated into the canyons for safety . " Eventually our fathers acquired sheep , cattle and horses from the Spanish and began living more nomadically as we had to constantly find new pastures for our animals . Farming somewhat forgotten , we began to raid the Spanish-Mexican enemy that occupied our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different challenge . New people came to settle around the water holes and kill the game . " Now the storyteller turned directly to Nistsxaaz . " We tried for fifteen years to hold our land , and then were defeated by Colonel ( ' arson 's troops . His army invaded the Navajo nation , killing livestock , burning crops and orchards . Eventually , near starvation , we had to surrender . " We were sent to Basque Redondo , near Fort Sumner in New Mexico , and told this was our new home . " Soon after our arrival , we planted three thousand acres of irrigated land near the Pecos River . The corn was a failure , devoured by a cutworm shortly before harvesting . The next summer we doubled the farm area , planting corn , wheat and melons , but the cutworms again destroyed the crops . The summer of 1866 brought a drought . The fields were full of alkali and the next year the corn grew only two feet high . " By this time we were traveling over twenty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington said they had spent over ten million dollars for food and clothing . Our dwellings at the fort consisted of deep holes in the ground , roofed with branches , brush and hides . Nearly two thousand people died of dysentery and pneumonia . " Finally , after four long , hard years of suffering , a spokesman for our people , Barboncito , talked with General Sherman . " Remembering , Bi tah ni tso smiled .  | " Barboncito had a drooping mustache that almost covered his top lip , and his eyes did not focus , yet as he stood before the council he was magnificent . Tears came to his eyes as he spoke to the officials . ' Many of our people have died here . Many of our animals have died . Our grandfathers and our fathers lived within the four sacred mountains .

' A treaty was signed by twenty-nine of our headmen and ten representatives of the U.S. government , declaring terms and establishing a reservation for our people . In our joy that we could return , we paid little attention to what the agreement required . Our hardship was forgotten in our desire to come and see the red canyon country again . " Now we are within a day 's travel of where our farms used to be . Nistsxaaz , your life may have been hard during this time , but be thankful you were able to evade capture . This is a beautiful land and just being back one night makes my spirit feel a rebirth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end the long walk . "  | Excitement infiltrated the camp as curious ears picked up the story like a sponge absorbing water . There were rumors that Mericats had crossed the desert country near Chinle Wash . Carriers told of these people , called Mormons , who had come from near the Paiute territory in western Utah . Word was that they had settled near Montezuma on the San Juan River . They were a strange people , seemingly unafraid of the Indians , with a policy to feed rather than fight . The years had deepened the lines in Nistsxaaz 's face . He showed no response as he listened intently to the news relayed by his thirteenyear-old son . Chief 's excited voice brought his mother from under the shade , where she was weaving a medicine basket . Chipeta had become slightly plump , but she still carried herself well . She had labored endlessly in teaching her son the ways of beauty , the wisdom of understanding , the value of listening . She had taught him of her Ute people as well as the Navajo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a rumor of white settlers , but she smiled to herself as she remembered her own desire to view the omnipowerful soldiers . She had since seen the white men on occasion , but was not too impressed with them . Few dared venture into the wild regions of Navajo Mountain , and her independent husband refused to go trade for supplies , insistent upon keeping the ways of their fathers . It was the general practice of all the Navajos who had returned from Bosque Redondo , and most of the others , to receive rations from the government . They secretly respected but openly scoffed at Nistsxaaz 's isolated viewpoints . In the treaty it was stated that all Navajo children between the ages of six and sixteen should attend school . Nistsxaaz strongly opposed this , so Chief had remained ignorant of the world beyond their untamed kingdom . Nistsxaaz listened carefully to the young boy , as he always did , and thought for a long time before he answered .  | " Would you like to see these men ? " Chief 's answer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the approving eye of the wife and mother . Father and son began their journey early as the bright sun was challenging the lesser stars to remain in his presence . They took with them two extra horses and a few blankets Litso had woven , planning on trading them to the Mormons . Chief turned to Nistsxaaz , his young , innocent face animated . " What will they think of us ? " Nistsxaaz was surprised . He had not thought of the Mormon 's actions towards them . He had just known they would be friendly , as the reports of others who had seen them indicated . And , of course , two Navajos would mean nothing to them . In his honesty , Nistsxaaz tried to give the boy an answer that would n't disappoint him . " They will think you a powerful young man because of your name , Chief . " The young boy spurred his horse with a shout of glee and rode ahead , then returned to his father 's side , curiosity drawing his brown face into lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had received his name , but never had he thought before to ask his father how he obtained his . Nistsxaaz smiled at this unexpected turn of events . " When I was a young man " ( he denied that he had ever been a boy ) , " much smaller than yourself , so small as to barely begin to speak , my father and the other men were going hunting . I begged to go with them because I had a tiny bow my grandfather had made me . They just laughed , but I insisted , saying , I am Nistsxaaz , I am large enough ! ' And from then on they called me by that name . " Chief chuckled gleefully as Nistsxaaz knew he would . It was a comical story , but the man deserved the name , as he was indeed larger than most of his Navajo brothers . " Father , " Chief was suddenly serious , " why have you avoided the white men these years , and now have decided to search them out ? "  | Nistsxaaz pondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were some white men in Hopi and Navajo land near Moenkopi . They came as friends , or so the story is told , but they and some of our people had trouble and one of their men was killed . After hearing of this , I dismissed it as another problem between the Indian and the white to be forgotten , but later I had a dream . " In this dream I saw the white men come to our land to settle . I wanted to chase them out as we have done in the past . In my dream , I was told that if we wanted war , eventually all the Navajos would perish , as the white men are many in number . We instead should seek out the special white men who would offer to feed our people rather than fight . I have never known where to look , but your story of these people is close . We must go see what they are like . " " What can they do for us if they are n't Navajo ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit the part in my dream , they can do much for our people , and we are to help them . " Chief accepted his father 's explanation , noting mentally that there was more than one kind of white man , much as there were different kinds of Navajos . Late into the second night , long after they had doused their fire and were sleeping soundly near the settlement where they had viewed a log cabin before dark set in , the two were awakened by slurred and garrulous voices . Nistsxaaz was perplexed at the language , but Chief , who had been taught his mother 's tongue , understood part of the dialogue and caught the meaning of their words . He was strangely quiet as the Ute riders splashed across the river . Could he be sure of what he had heard ? Yes , there was no doubt . He turned to his father and explained in a hoarse whisper , " They brag about killing many Mericats up the river , and say they will finish off all the intruders . Father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nistsxaaz 's mind . He knew it was none of their business , and they should turn around and leave . Yet there was something , he knew not what , that compelled him to go and warn the whites of their danger . Saddling their tired mounts , Chief and Nistsxaaz swiftly circled  | the slow-moving Utes and rode toward the log cabin and wagons that marked the beginning of the settlement . Nistsxaaz was perplexed at the force that drove him , and confused as to how he would relay his message once they arrived . Coming into view of the houses , he desired to turn back , but could not . Harvey Dunton was an old man and seventy years of living had taught him a great deal . He was lying awake in bed , thinking of all the work that needed doing in this new country , when he heard the dog barking and rose to see what was upsetting the animal . As he stepped outside , he viewed the Navajo and his son sliding from their ponies . That their mission was urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few words of Navajo and greeted them , " Yatahay . " Taking this to mean he understood their language , Nistsxaaz jumped into a long line of guttural sounds . The white man raised his hands to halt the big Navajo . " Yaah ? Hazhoogo . " Nistsxaaz began again , slowly , and finally he got through to the old man what was to happen . He told him if the families would come with them into Navajo territory , they would be safe . Dunton realized that the entire Meeker family had probably been massacred , and knew of the extreme danger they were in , but refused the offer to go with the two Navajos . He went to warn the Harriman and Davis families and when he returned to thank the Indians they were gone . Nistsxaaz and Chief had retreated to the safety of some high rocks to watch what might happen . The Utes stopped for most of the night , but towards dawn the dogs began barking again and running up and down the river bank . The watching men in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile away , the warring Utes suddenly changed direction and headed toward the stronghold of some distant renegades . When it was light , the two Navajos went for their forgotten horses and gear and returned to the thankful Mormons , who invited the Indians to remain with them for breakfast . They accepted and hungrily ate of the generous helpings offered . This fortified Nistsxaaz 's feeling that these people might be the ones he waited for , but was disappointed to find that the Mormons were very low on supplies and could not spare any to trade for his animals and rugs .  | Just as they were ready to leave , C'hief 's eyes caught sight of a beautiful palomino gelding . With a cry of delight , he ran over to the strange , beautiful creature , running his hands over its smooth body . " Well , I 'll be , " Harvey Dunton whistled , " that colt hai n't never let anyone within ten feet of it , and that 's the truth ! He 's never been any good to us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for your own ? " Nistsxaaz would n't accept the horse as a gift , but after considerable bartering , Nistsxaaz traded Dunton four blankets and his best cayuse . Now Chief owned the yellow horse .  | Chief was ecstatic ! Never in his life had he owned anything all by himself , let alone a golden horse . What would the other boys think ? His golden horse would be the envy for miles around . Nistsxaaz sensed his son 's thoughts . He knew it was only natural for the youth to be proud , but it concerned him . " Chief , your grandfather once had a beautiful horse . " Chief leaned forward , eagerly awaiting the story he knew was coming . " Not a pony ? " " No , a large white stallion that came from the Spanish . He was a young man , like yourself , and very proud of his white horse . He rode it around in front of everyone and said to them . This is an immortal horse . No one can take it from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would someday die , but your grandfather believed it never would . " " What happened to the horse , Father ? " Nistsxaaz tolerated the interruption good-humoredly . " One day , Grandfather was riding in front of some pretty girls who lived by his family . He wanted to show them how fast it could run , so he whipped and kicked , and the great horse ran like the wind . " He paused , looked into Chief 's shining eyes and relished the suspense he was creating for the boy . " What happened then ? " " The horse stepped in a chuckhole and broke its leg . They had to kill the great animal . " As an afterthought , Nistsxaaz added , " Your grandfather broke his leg , also , but they decided to let him live . " Chief howled with laughter . The whole world was wonderful this day . Nothing could change it . " When can we stop and make camp , Father ? "  | Nistsxaaz knew what the youth had in mind . " Do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned at his father 's insight . " Lightning . That would be a good name for him , would it not ? " His father nodded his head in agreement . " Your mother is expecting us back tomorrow . If we start early in the morning , we could stop early tonight . " Nistsxaaz felt a longing in his heart for his wife and wanted to ride right on to get home that night . " You may ride your horse when we stop . " He smiled in anticipation of seeing the battle between the young boy and the young horse . Chief would learn that it was further to the ground from a tall horse than from the scrawny cayuses he was accustomed to riding . The day dragged on . Slowly , slowly the sun moved across the sky . Finally , seeing the spot he had been looking for , Nistsxaaz pulled his pony to a halt , and , after dismounting , reached for supplies to make camp . Chief jumped from his brown mount and tied him to a small juniper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large sandy area . Out of some rope his father had fashioned a halter to lead the palomino with , as he was reluctant to be driven . As Chief talked softly to the skittish colt , he looped the rope and slipped it deftly over the wellshaped head . He ran his hand down the long neck of the horse , patting gently . Then , in the right position , and before the horse had time to bat an eyelash , the youth leaped to his back , pressing his knees and thighs into the colt 's side , grabbing a fistful of mane in one brown hand , and the rope in the other . Nistsxaaz watched the eternal second , as the horse realized what had happened . As if frozen in time , the bolt of lightning did not strike , but remained caught in a cloud of confusion , unable to act . Neither did the boy react . Then the moment broke , and the excited boy and terrified colt were gone into a world of their own . Chief stayed on the colt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how perfect they looked , the brown child and golden colt . And then they were separated , Chief landing full on his back . It knocked the wind from the boy and he lay with his eyes closed . The colt walked over to him and nuzzled his face .  | When Chief had recovered , he rose and the colt hacked off . Nistsxaaz watched with intense interest , hardly daring to breathe for fear of breaking the spell between the two young creatures . Time and again the tireless boy mounted the colt ; time and again the fantastic golden horse preserved his freedom . For an hour they battled , then the sand-covered child , his spirit broken , walked up to the horse . " Lightning , I wish to ride you into camp . You and I would look so fine , going first . You do n't want to follow an ugly brown horse , do you ? A horse that would distract from your beauty ? . . . " The horse snorted and the boy 's face lit up . At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he jumped onto the palomino . With confidence , the horse pranced for a few seconds and then threw the unsuspecting boy . Nistsxaaz could hold his laughter no longer . It ran over the land , echoing back from the canyons . Chief was sore all over , but nothing hurt as much as his pride . Defeated , he started to walk over to untie his brown pony . " Are you going to give up ? " Nistsxaaz was serious now as he viewed the disheartened boy . " Why do n't you try once more ? " Chief was almost in tears , but at his father 's words , he turned to try again . He scratched the colt behind the ears , pleading with him , begging him . As he reached for the rope , the four stocking feet danced backward , the horse lifted his head defiantly , then , almost humbly , he moved to where the boy could reach the dangling rope . Chief swung upward to prove to his father that it was useless , but to his surprise he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to separate himself from the boy . The day brightened instantly . Chief looked triumphantly at his father , and Nistsxaaz could not help feeling a little proud himself . They rode away from the sand area and circled the camp before Chief dismounted . After caring for his new friend , he tied the horse for the night . The sun was high overhead as the two men rode into camp . At least Chief considered himself a man now . He was stiff , but no one could tell it , he rode so tall and straight . 4  | Chipeta had been watching for her husband and son to return . I lcr world was so empty without them . When they came into the clearing , she looked in surprise at the golden horse and her man-son , then ran toward them calling in greeting . Chief tried to warn his mother , but it was too late . The startled colt rose in the air , his front hooves flying . Chipeta brought her arms across her face as the colt knocked her down . Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perplexed at the cries around him . His sharp hooves struck the woman on the head . Rising , Chief saw the blank look come into his mother 's once-bright eyes before her lids fell softly , her lashes long and dark on her bruised cheeks . Chief stumbled in an attempt to help , but Nistsxaaz was already there , cradling his beautiful wife in his arms . " Chi , Chi , " the name caught in Nistsxaaz 's throat . His whole body sagged and he felt a very old man as he realized his wife was dying . Chief stood awkwardly to the side , once again an awkward boy . He desperately wished his mother would open her eyes and smile at him , making everything all right again . He bent , tenderly touching his father 's shoulder , but the old man pushed him aside . " Chi , Chi , Chi , " Nistsxaaz sobbed like a child . Chief was hurt and confused . More than ever before he needed the mother who had always been his guardian , always when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father who was stalwart , unconquerable , now was incoherent in his emotion-filled cries . Chief had never before felt so insecure and lost . What could he do , to whom could he turn ? "  | Chief lay on his back , gazing at the clouds in the sky . They appeared as sheep , though some were scattering , and one formation looked like an old gray woman . She must be herding them , he thought , and if all the white sheep hide behind the mountain she will become angry and dark with vexation ; but then , when she still can not find the sheep , she will cry . He was pleased with his version of rain , then his thoughts drew to a serious plane . " I wish I could cry , Mother . I wish I could cry for you . " He turned over , making an impression in the soft sand under him . A fiddle-shaped spider ran for safety behind a dried sunflower stem , then stopped . Chief viewed the immobile form with sudden spite . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He slapped his fist close to the spider and it quickly disappeared over a dirt clod . The brown youth was instantly sorry over his outburst , but it really did n't seem to matter . Nothing mattered any more . He rolled onto his hack again , viewing the progress of the sheep clouds . The gray grandmother was becoming darker . She changes so quickly , he thought dismally , like Father . In the weeks since his mother 's death , Nistsxaaz was inconsolable , wasting away in his grief . He refused the food that Litso so temptingly prepared for him . She stayed with him constantly ? sometimes softly talking , sometimes humming ? most of the time silent , but always trying to destroy the bonds of grief that rendered the powerful man helpless . Chief did not know this new man . A part of his father had died with his mother , possibly the most important part ? his desire to exist . Litso 's daughters were grown and married . She , herself , an old woman , though a faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was only Chief , and he was constantly reminded that Nistsxaaz blamed Chipeta 's death on his carelessness .  | Nistsxaaz was not the only one that expressed this view . Throughout the clan there was a prevailing attitude condemning the boy . His name was once spoken with respect and acceptance , as the people believed he would become a chief . They now addressed him with contempt . His mother had been revered and loved and her untimely death was distressing to each one . Kai , growing more bitter towards life with each passing year , had insisted they kill the golden horse . He said the animal was possessed with a devil . To destroy the horse had been Nistsxaaz 's first instinct also , but Chief was able to dissuade him . " It 's not your fault , " Chief spoke out loud to the horse as he grazed nearby . Then with more conviction he emphasized the sentence . " It 's not your fault , nor mine ! " However , anyone listening to the boy would have thought him unsure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base of Monitor Butte and as he viewed Elk Mountain to the northeast , he remembered how his mother had told of her experience in accepting the Navajo way in the hope of blending the ways of the Ute and Navajo . This effort was continually on her mind , and she spoke of her people often . Chief look at the mountain and wondered idly whether or not he would ever have reason to find his mother 's people . Chipeta had spent long hours telling Chief of his grandparents . She had taught well and Chief was proud of his Ute heritage , considering them a great and indomitable people . His present world was allencompassing and though his mother 's people did not live many miles away , they somehow seemed distant and untouchable . The grandmother cloud began to cry , her tears coming fast and wild . In a matter of seconds Chief was soaked . He lifted his face to the cold drops , facing the heavy black cloud above him . " Grandmother , if you cry too hard , you will wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time since the tragic day , then shrugging off the unaccustomed facial expression , he vaulted gracefully to the colt 's back and rode in the direction of home . Nistsxaaz was sitting in the hogan anticipating his son 's return , almost angry at his absence . He should be here helping Litso prepare to go to their summer home near Navajo Mountain , instead of out daydreaming somewhere on his horse . The old man stepped outside over  | Litso 's protest , and stood in the rain , scanning the horizon . He could see Chief in the distance , leaning close to the animal he loved . As he came closer , Nistsxaaz felt betrayed . Why had the boy turned away from him just when he needed companionship the most ? Chief rode to his father 's side and cautiously looked into the face of the man who used to hold him in his lap , the man who taught him of nature and survival . This could not be the same person . This face was different , set in haggard , hard lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridle and spoke in a seldomused voice , " Get off and put this horse up . I have arranged to trade him for more sheep and I want him close in the morning . You have not been tending the sheep properly and we have lost too many . We will regain those lost by trading Lightning . " As Nistsxaaz spoke , he caught the expression of pain that crossed Chief 's face . One part of the old man told him to embrace the child-man and tell him what he 'd just been told was n't true , the horse could stay ; but the more dominant half condemned the boy and begged that the horse be kept far away where he would n't have to see it again . Chief had not understood why his father had become so distant and irritable , and now this ! He would not let this man take away his prized possession , his only solace , his happiness . " No , you ca n't ! " The words sounded terrible , for he had never questioned his father before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me here . Lightning will take me to my mother 's people ! " Before he could see the impact this announcement made on his father , the boy wheeled the horse and rode into the darkening rain . Nistsxaaz stood transfixed for several minutes , a statue in the gray mist . His shoulders fell and he dropped to the ground as if praying . Chipeta was gone from his life , and the son she had brought to him was leaving . The old man felt empty and weary . For the first time in fifty years , he cried , his tears indiscernible among the raindrops . He knew he must go after his son , but he also knew he could not find Chief in the night . He would have to leave as the sun rose in the morning . The sun was not visible the next day , the rain having continued through the night . Chief was cold and very hungry , not having brought  | anything with him to eat . He crawled from beneath the cluster of junipers where he had spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great rolling waters of the San Juan had risen during the night . The heavy rain , combined with the spring run-off , made the river an impregnable opponent , quite different to the low-water crossing he had made the night before . Chief wondered if the colt would be strong enough to fight the swift current . He will have to , Chief thought remorsefully , we 've got to go back . With this thought guiding his actions , Chief swung onto the horse 's back and turned toward the river . Lightning balked at the water 's edge . The river was deep and cold . Chief began shivering violently . He leaned closer to the colt for warmth . The horse turned , refusing to cross . After several attempts Chief dismissed the idea of getting back across for the present , and dismounted to rest . He again thought of the events of the night before , surprised at the decision that had been made so quickly . He had started toward a foreign land filled with aliens . True , Chipeta had told him they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief 's mind , it burned that he would be a lot different to them than Chipeta . He was a stranger , a half-breed . He was sure time would heal the differences between himself and his father . Maybe his father would reconsider and let him keep Lightning if he took better care of the sheep . Chief remounted his horse , ready to try again , when he saw a man lowering his horse into the south side of the river . It was Nistsxaaz . Chief 's heart swelled in thankfulness as he realized his father had come for him . He was glad and yet dismayed . Would his father still insist on getting rid of the golden horse ? Frozen in thought , the boy watched his father 's progress . Halfway across the river , Nistsxaaz was struck by one of the cottonwood trees the current carried . It knocked the old man from his horse and spun him around too far to catch the horse again . He grabbed for the tree to hold onto , but was knocked under again . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be free of the churning , murky water . Nistsxaaz never came back up .  | Chief was numb as he watched the drama before him . The horse had climbed back on the bank and stood with drooping head , breathing heavily . The log turned over slowly as the current carried it on below where Nistsxaaz had disappeared . Chief watched the freezing brown waters in their progress , realizing that now he had no one to go home to . He was alone in an unfamiliar land . The rain turned into snowflakes , fat and heavy . Grandmother has found her sheep , and she is beating them until their wool falls . Chief sat numbly on his horse looking at the spot where he had last seen Nistsxaaz.  | In physical stature , Kumen Jones was not a large man , but when one felt his firm handshake and heard his strong , unwavering voice , they were left with the impression that he was powerful and large . Unconsciously singing a Welsh ballad , Kumen viewed the heavy ( lakes that had already laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful sight , the majestic red rocks crowned with white , the scrubby hushes and puny trees regal in their lacy patterned gowns . Many of the pioneers on the wagon train surveyed the storm dismally . It only meant another discomfort in their long trip to Montezuma , and there had already been too much delay . The company consisted of ninety men , thirty women and sixty children , who were completing the last part of their seven-month journey . Called from southwestern Utah to settle Fort Montezuma with the Davis and Harriman families , they had , after scouts indicated a new route was feasible , taken a " short cut " across the state . This chosen path of perpendicular cliffs and treacherous canyons entailed one particularly hazardous place a cleft one hundred feet at the start and continuing precariously for several hundred more between sheer rock walls that bordered the Colorado River . The pioneers built a road down through this almost impregnable cliff and thereafter referred to themselves as " Hole-in-theRockers . " This March snowstorm was winter 's fierce goodbye and the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for shelter and warmth . Having just faced the perils of Clay Hill Pass , everyone was glad to rest , but they found it impossible to be comfortable in the freezing cold . Chief viewed this strung-out gathering of eighty odd wagons after traveling north for a good part of the day . He could see women cooking over the large fires and his mind begged for the warmth of a fire and the pleasant feeling of having a full stomach . He remembered his father 's dream and wondered if these were the people who might in some way  | help the Indians . If they were as friendly as the white people in Montezuma , they might share some food with him . The copper-skinned youth was petrified at approaching the many people who were gathered below him , but more afraid of the perils of nature . After the events of this ugly day , he longed for the companionship of human beings . It took little urging to head Lightning in the direction of the wagon train . Kumen looked up to see the Indian rider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , look at that , if you have ever seen the unexpected . Do you remember Harvey Dunton telling about their near escape at Montezuma with the Utes ? He said he traded one of the Indians a loco palomino colt . Now how many lone Indians do you see approaching a group of white people , let alone riding a horse like that ? " Mary agreed that it might be the same Indian , well remembering the old Dunton man who had left the settlement to come join his son and the Hole-in-the-Rock group . Kumen walked toward the youth , who halted at the approach of the white man . In his limited Navajo , Kumen asked the boy to stay with them and find shelter from the storm . Surprise and delight registered in the haggard face , but no words escaped the closed lips . Kumen pressed no further , but motioned the lad to follow as he returned to his wagon . Mary had a bowl of potato stew , made with some beef chunks from the cow Platte Lyman had slaughtered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornbread before the starving boy , who ate vigorously , never pausing between bites . After refilling his bowl , Mary went in search of the James Dunton wagon , trying to locate Harvey in order to identify the Indian boy . After inquiring of different families she learned that the Duntons were among the first wagons , strung for several miles up the trail toward the base of Elk Mountain . Kumen , after making sure the boy 's appetite was satisfied , again attempted an inquiry , receiving no reply . He studied the boy , who was dressed in Navajo clothing but did not entirely resemble the Navajos . He could not be very old and yet his eyes held the wisdom of a grown man .  | In turn , Chief watched the kind man and his young wife . Instinctivcly , he knew they were good , honest people , and he could tell by their actions how much they respected and deeply loved each other . This woman 's kind actions reminded him of his mother , though she was just six years older than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to carry her image in his heart the rest of his life . As night fell , the storm turned into a raging blizzard , great swirls of snow seeking out every shelter . Chief 's place beneath the wagon was hardly more comfortable than being in the open , but at least he had a warm quilt in which to wrap himself and Kumen had made sure of Lightning 's well-being . Chief slept deeply , oblivious to the biting cold and stinging wind around him . He was physically and emotionally drained . As he slept , he dreamed of the white man 's square houses , much finer than those houses he had seen at Montezuma . A grasshopper came and told him to try the vegetables in the gardens of these people . A red bird came and told him to eat of the delicious fruit that grew on the trees by the houses . Chief told them there could be no houses , no vegetables , no fruit , for this was a desert and nothing could exist under the blazing sun and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Go see Coyote , " they said . " He will tell you . " Chief tried to find Coyote , but he could not find his way from among the many houses . The people smiled at him and invited him to eat , but Chief refused , insisting there could be no food . As he walked , he could see all kinds of people . There were Ute people and Navajo people , besides the whites . They all lived in fine houses . Chief asked one of the Navajos , who looked like his friend , Atsa , " Why do you live in these square houses instead of in a hogan ? " The Atsa man just shook his head and smiled . Then came the man named Kumen . Chief asked him the same question . Kumen invited him to sit and have some soup and cornbread . Then Kumen said to him , " When every kind of people live together , sharing with one another , then the land is happy and it provides for all . " A creaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | feeling from the dream and wanted to go hack to sleep , to return to this place and find out more from this Kumen . He wondered if the Kunten who was here now could tell him about the dream , but he thought he would be laughed at . Still he felt closer to the white man than he had the previous night and knew he had found a friend . The creaking sound was Kumen and Mary , moving around in the wagon , preparing for the day . Kumen descended and took Chief with him to go feed Lightning some grain . When they returned , Mary had breakfast fixed , and they sat together , Kumen and Mary bowing their heads and folding their hands . Chief thought this must be some kind of ceremony , and so as not to appear ungrateful , he also bowed his head and closed his eyes . After Kumen finished blessing the food , he and Mary smiled at each other , then Kumen spoke as Chief raised his head , " Will you continue with us today ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he just smilingly shook his head , mounted Lightning and , carrying the lunch Mary had prepared for him , followed the path taken by the other wagons , holding to the fringe of the trail on his journey toward Elk Mountain where he believed he would be welcomed by his mother 's people .  | The biting blizzard stung Chief 's eyes and froze his slender body through the scanty clothing designed for the low country . He was forcing Lightning through growing drifts in the whirling snow . The horse stumbled and almost fell , an indiscernible rock shifting beneath hint . Chief halted the worn-out horse and squinted at the towering white hillside above him . He sighed in defeat . He could go no further . The boy and his horse had already accomplished the impossible by coming as far as they had . Unaware of his whereabouts and confused as to where the Utes would be camped , Chief realized the absurdity of his flight . One thing was certain , he could not continue this hazardous roaming about . Turning Lightning around , they headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees or a cave . In his mind he could visualize the home near Navajo Mountain that he loved so much ? the warmth of the hogan and the memories of his mother . He could almost taste the fried bread and smell the fragrant mutton stew . Remembering this brought pangs of hunger , but he dared not eat the lunch Mary Jones had prepared ; it was all he had and the next meal was too indefinite . The Joneses ' kind faces rose before him and he thought curiously of ' the strange , light-skinned people . Who were they and where had they come from ? Were they like first man and first woman , coming from another world ? Kumen had said they came down through the Hole-inthe-Rock ; but Nistsxaaz had told Chief wagons went around by Lee 's Ferry because they could not cross the country Kumen had talked about . It was perplexing , and he did n't need any more troubles added to an already distressing situation , so Chief dismissed it from his mind . The snow was letting up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by heavy silence . Lightning found the going easier and Chief was tempted to let the horse have rein so he could sleep , but the need to find shelter was urgent ; they could not continue much longer .  | After another mile of labored half-steps , the horse stopped . Chief awoke with a start , not realizing that he had been sleeping , but not remembering the last part of the descent . He stiffly dismounted and led Lightning for a short distance , coming to a pretty little clearing with spring grass showing through the scattered snow . It seemed they had entered a different world , a spot where winter could n't intrude . Chief imagined he heard a bird chirp and looking toward the sound , he saw a rock overhang , partially hidden by pinion trees . It appeared to be a cave ; investigating , the boy belly-scooted inward , waited for his eyes to focus and then continued his entrance . The ceiling of the shallow brown cave seemed to reach out for him , but the shelter was warm and dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people long ago . Chills ran up and down Chief 's back . What spirits did this cave contain ? The invisible bird sang yet another short song and Chief took it to mean that all was well . His heart rose in excited happiness as he went back out to hobble Lightning . Dusk was closing in as the boy finished preparations for his night meal . A rabbit snare was instrumental in capturing a fat cottontail which was roasting over his small fire . Adequate dry limbs and bark were available at the entrance of the small cave , and it had been easy to gather enough to keep his fire through the night . Melted snow was contained in a clay pot he had unearthed , finding it partially protruding from the once hard-packed dirt floor . His diggings had also revealed pieces of other bowls and a large arrowhead of an earlier people . The juicy meat was delicious and Chief hungrily ate the whole rabbit , leaving but a pile of bones in remembrance . Completely exhausted , but content after the long , frustrating day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fire to sleep . The fire was low and a chill had set in when Chief was awakened by a foreign noise . He curled into himself in terror at the sound , every fiber but his imaginative mind frozen with fear . Fear of what ? he finally asked , and forced himself to relax somewhat in not knowing . Somewhere , sometime , Chief had been impressed with the idea that evil spirits came into caves to rest after bothering everyone they could find . He had no basis for this idea , but it might be so and the noise that had awakened him had not yet been defined .  | The boy dared not move and yet he knew he must build up the fire to drive out the darkness . Finally , summoning all of his courage , he moved to the branches and piled some on the hot coals . They soon burned brightly and Chief ventured to look out towards the cover where Lightning was . The hobbled horse was standing quietly , seeming to be waiting for morning and their continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Coward ! " Oh , if he could be like his father , strong and fearless . Chief sank to the floor of the cave , his arms wrapped around his knees , rocking back and forth , sobbing , his emotions spilling out . All the pent-up feelings since his mother 's death , the confusion from his father 's indifference , the clan 's hissed accusations , the horror of losing his father to the brown , swirling waters , and lastly , the fears and apprehensions that beset him as he took on a journey to find his mother 's people . Caught up with exhaustion , the orphan 's hot , salty tears fell and sank into the powdery earthen floor . The soft night breezes cooled Chief 's swollen face . He washed away the streaked dirt on his cheeks and lay down again . The tears were all gone , the floor of the cave was dry and Chief was emotionally empty . I I is problems seemed diminished after his outburst . Resolutely Chief tried to remember all the things his mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they stayed at Allen Canyon from the spring to hot summer before going to Elk Mountain . Perhaps they were there now or , if not , surely they would be coming soon . Reluctant to stay any longer than necessary , Chief rose with the first light of dawn and prepared to go east where he was sure he would find the right canyon . The boy traveled along the base of the mountain from Pickett into Comb Wash . Early afternoon found him staring at the high walls of the Comb Reef . The impregnable barrier further discouraged the disheartened boy . He looked up and down , searching the horizon for a way through . In the north , the Elk Mountain foothills seemed to blend into the Reef . Chief guided Lightning in that direction , wondering if he 'd ever reach the far hills . More hours of traveling in the chilly March breezes brought the boy to a trail leading down into Cottonwood Wash . It was a wide trail  | and had signs of being built up and repaired in some places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wagons had traveled this way in his lifetime , though he could imagine ancient horse-drawn carts that had carried other people along this road . At the end of the day Chief came upon a more heavily traveled trail . Not knowing which way to turn , he decided to stop and spend the night , postponing until morning a decision on which trail to follow . There was water in the wash and he let Lightning drink and nibble at the surrounding grasses . He set the rabbit snare and set out to look for squirrels ' nests where he was sure he could find a cache of pine nuts . A distant noise attracted his attention . Horses were coming on the trail up the wash to the side of him . Chief ran down the small hillside and stopped behind some bushes . He could see four riders in the distance . Heavy and darker skinned than the Navajos , these men were gaudily dressed in white men 's shirts . Their hair hung in braids beneath black hats . The men were talking in loud tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon their discourse . Chief realized these were the people he was searching for . These men were Utes , his mother 's people . A feeling of mixed emotions surged upon him . His seemingly eternal search was over . He was joyous to greet them and yet afraid all of a sudden , afraid to encounter these strangers . The riders were closer , and he had no time for indecision . Chief stepped out into the trail , the sight of him halting the Ute men immediately . In the ensuing silence , Chief 's thoughts raced along the same lines as the Utes ' . A boy dressed in traditional Navajo leggings and shirt , his hair coiled in a bun at the back of his neck . Uncertainty registered in the face of the boy ; almost instantly fear overtook him as he understood the full implication of his appearance . He was Navajo ; he was enemy ; and the Utes ' first instinct would be to destroy him . The silence born from waiting sounded in his ears . He shrank before the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces of the men as they recognized he was a mere boy . The closest Ute pulled his rifle from its scabbard and raised it menacingly in Chief 's direction .  | The Ute holding the rifle was a stocky , stolid man who sat in his saddle as though he 'd never been out of it . He addressed the rest of the group with a heavy , guttural grunt . " Where does this young one come from ? Out of the sky , maybe , eh ? " He ended his question with a loud guffaw and while the others echoed his hoarse laugh , he sat studying Chief , the rifle still at level . He was aware of the possible danger this boy presented . Perhaps the boy was a decoy placed here by their lifelong enemies . The chance that he might be alone was unthinkable , but no one else was in sight , nor had they seen another movement . The solid-built Ute , Mancos Jim , had three other companions on which to rely . All four men were typically lackadaisical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which the Ute sought and craved . " What shall we do with him ? " Mancos Jim joked , trying to renew the dying laughter . " Maybe he likes dancing among the trees above bullets , or sitting in ant beds , huh ? " Chief caught the joke in his words , but also feared that if the idea sounded good enough , the men might try it . Caught up in the terror of the moment , he was unable to think straight and blurted out the first thing that came to his mind . " I am looking for Hatch . " Silence dropped heavily on the group as they stared at the youth in surprise . Despite his definite accent , his Ute words were unmistakable . Mancos Jim was the first to jolt back from surprise . " Why you looking for Hatch ? " Chief desperately tried to explain his situation and tell them that his mother spoke of Hatch , who was married to her cousin . His story out , with some verbal help from the Utes , Chief then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was almost too fantastic to believe , but this was a wild country and many times fact was stranger than fiction . Besides , he did n't think any Navajo was clever enough to think up a tale such as this . " You have a horse , half-breed ? " At Chief 's nod , the Ute prepared to go on . " Get it and follow us . " Chief ran to unhobble Lightning , and had to gallop the palomino to catch up with the others . Mancos Jim never looked back as Chief fell in behind them . The men with him followed his example and ignored the boy . They talked and joked among themselves . Soon their discussion turned to an argument . Chief listened to their quarrels with interest . They were talking about two white prospectors who had been murdered the previous winter ? Mitchell and Merrick . These men were searching for the Navajos ' Pasheekine Silver Mine . Chief recognized the name of the mine , a very wealthy mine , its whereabouts unknown to all but the Navajo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospectors . Another said it was renegade Paiutes . Mancos Jim turned around , glaring at the two men . They cut their discourse short . Forty-five minutes from where they 'd met Chief , the men rode into camp . Curiosity sparked excitement in the women and children scattered through the wickiups . Mancos Jim looked at Chief for the first time and saw the boy 's fine mount . Jealousy crept into his eyes . He controlled his envy visibly , though silently he began thinking in terms of obtaining the golden horse . He told Chief that the rest of the group would not arrive until tomorrow , then , pointing to a fire , he indicated that Chief should eat and stay there . Chief was wary of these aliens . Their blood was his blood , but their ways were not . He was unaware that Mancos Jim was also watching him . The Ute leader positioned guards in case the half-breed 's story was not true . Chief ate of the boiled meat and drank the goats ' milk he was given . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tended a fat baby strapped to a cradle board . The papoose 's arms were free and it had a leather thong tied to one arm . At the end of the thong Silent Thunder 67  | was strung a piece of fat , which the teething baby lustily chewed and Mucked on . Once Chief heard a gagging sound and looked up to see the brown baby choking on the fat , flailing its arms . Before Chief could move to help the baby , the frantic motion of its arms pulled the fat out , making a popping noise . The baby 's mother never even looked up . Chief was surprised at her apparent unconcern , but decided that it must not be an unusual occurrence . The fires burned lower and Chief 's eyelids kept falling and his head was nodding . Finally , in complete exhaustion , he stretched out on the ground in total sleep . The woman covered him with an old blanket , then went into her wickiup . Camp noises woke him the next morning . The sun was well up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman was again at the tire , cooking . She seemed amused at the youth 's attempt to gather in his dignity after oversleeping , but shook off his offer to go for wood . getting wood was a woman 's job . If she allowed him to do this , he would be laughed at the rest of his life . Smiling , she declined the boy and motioned for him to sit while she fixed him something to eat . Chief felt comfortable with this woman who did not demand any conversation from him , but treated him as a friend . He played with the bright-eyed baby and ate of the hot mush the woman handed him . It was thick , lumpy , and a little hard to swallow , but the black steaming coffee helped drive the dryness from his throat . Completing his meal , he felt better , ready now to tackle the world and its problems , he thought . In mid-morning they were joined by a large group of Utes . Chief was taken to the man named Hatch , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were heavy-set , their bellies extending over their belts to the point most were unable to see their feet . Hatch was physically the most handsome man Chief had ever seen . The Ute man was quite aware of his fine physique and held himself erect and straight . Mancos Jim explained Chief 's presence to the handsome Hatch , who regarded Chief with partial contempt . He had enough problems without being burdened with this boy 's welfare . The only favorable part of Mancos Jim 's account was about the golden horse the boy owned . Hatch 's eyes glittered . He was a fair man , and he thought it only fair that he be repaid for taking in the orphan . The horse would be an acceptable gift , so the handsome Ute demanded Chief bring his horse to him . Silent Thunder 69  | Chief was speechless , hut he dared not voice his resentment , knowing it would he in vain , so he did as he was told . ! latch was very pleased at the animal 's appearance , and strode around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group was observing this drama , curious about the Navajo-appearing boy and the golden mount . I latch smiled at Chief and rose to Lightning 's back , the grin fading as the horse began prancing about . Hatch tried to rein the animal to a halt , but was not ready for the palomino 's reaction . The handsome Ute man went sailing through the air , landing in a clump of rabbit brush near where a group of women had been standing a split second before . Chief wanted to laugh with the rest of the group . He never would have thought that the heavy women could move so swiftly , but he was more apprehensive that Hatch would be angry at Lightning and harm the horse . If Hatch was upset , he hid his emotion , chuckling with the rest of the group as he brushed off the seat of his pants and again approached the wild-eyed palomino . He held the reins undecidedly and then turned to a three-hundred-pound man and motioned towards the saddle with a nod of his head , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move with you on top of him . " The group howled with laughter as Charlie good-humoredly struggled onto the horse 's back . Lightning snorted and walked a few steps , then with a subdued snort turned and looked back at the heavy Indian . Tears rolled down the cheeks of the spectators as they viewed the homemade rodeo . Chief was sure their laughter could be heard for miles , and though he was caught up in the spell of the moment , still resented losing his prize possession . Lightning stood for several seconds as if in defeat , then when the seemingly victorious Ute was off guard , the horse reared high into the air , twisting as he sent the Indian smoothly into the air like a dove . Charlie landed with a thud that broke the earth into pieces below him . The din was deafening . Lightning high-stepped for several seconds in terror , then galloped away from the noise and confusion . Fun-loving Hatch turned to Chief with an unexplained acceptance in his eyes , " Go after your horse , young one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nomadic Ute people . He did n't have to tend sheep , as they only had a few goats . There was no farming , no crops to hoe or water . The women did most of the domestic work ? cooking , tending babies , moving the wickiups to follow their men , preparing the game brought in after a day 's hunt , and working the hides of the animals for clothing and household use . Hatch ordered the boy about , requiring that Chief care for his horse or clean a newly killed deer , and gave him other tasks of an unpleasant nature . Chief was aware of his " poor-relative " position and was determined not to resent Hatch 's commands . Eventually he nearly worshipped the Ute brave and was especially grateful that Hatch did not keep Lightning for himself . The two squaws of Hatch , Jane and Sally , were somewhat temperamental and opinionated , but they treated Chief respectfully and catered to the youth . All in all , it was the kind of situation most boys dream of ? excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chief was content , if not happy . For two months the tribe canvassed Allen Canyon , waiting for the lingering snows to melt on Elk Mountain , so they could move up to their summer home . Finally , the last part of May , the women once again haphazardly loaded the skittish , bony horses and the band was on the move . Their summer migration was similar to that of the Navajos in the way they moved everything they owned with them . The main difference was that the Navajos left their hogans and the Ute wickiups were portable . Chief discovered many similarities between the tribes , as had his mother before him . He came to better understand her wise teachings about looking for harmony in all things . There was an indefinable quality in every person he met . Everyone had their own fears and  | superstitions , structured on the unknown , that placed limitations on them , but there was also a willingness and desire to live and accomplish . Summertime passed quickly , the youth reveling in the delights of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animals or climb the higher plateaus and gaze at the wondrous patchwork around him . He could see Navajo Mountain , dark blue against the sky , rising upward , the holy mountain , protecting those who dwelt at its base . At times sharp pains of homesickness engulfed Chief as he recalled better days with his mother and father , but he had no real desire to return to the Navajos , at least not yet . He knew his mother would have been happy knowing he was living with her people , though he was not fulfilling her desires by expressing to the Utes that they should attempt to live in peace with those around them . Mother was wrong to think any one person , and especially a poor relative , could be responsible for such a large assignment . She could n't have understood how limited his life would be and how little opportunity he would have . The Utes ' deer hunt extended through the summer and then they drifted down into Indian Creek on their way to the LaSal Mountains . The band of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the last part of August , they met up with some renegade Utes who had just killed an Indian agent and his family in Colorado . The Colorado Utes were brave in their braggings about the massacre . All evening , around their large fire , they compared their most recent slaughter with previous adventures . Chief was enthralled with the exaggerated tales , but their descriptive account made him a little queasy , too , as it was apparent the Indians had no real reason to kill their victims except for the excitement . Chief went to bed wondering what the repercussions would be . He had nightmares about dying people . His mother 's face kept rising in front of him , tortured with pain at what her people were doing . The next morning was sultry , promising a dry , harsh day . The Colorado Utes , eager to get an early start , bartered and traded with Mancos Jim 's band , giving them a few fine horses in turn for several scrubby brush ponies .  | Mancos Jim and Hatch laughed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the deal . They soon found out otherwise , though . Two white men , the Maxwell brothers , rode into camp about mid-morning and demanded their stolen horses back . Surprised beyond argument , the Indians complied . After the two brothers left , the Utes argued among themselves . They had not stolen the horses ; they had traded for them . There was nothing to do but get them back . In agreement , nine of the Ute men and older boys decided to find the white men . Chief fell in with the party . The group was traveling the winding course of Pack Creek when they came upon two white boys herding cattle toward the upper LaSal range . A man in the rear of the group , having worked up his temper to an uncontrollable degree over the encroaching whites , pulled his rifle from its scabbard and with the words , " Skunks of the earth ! " pulled the trigger , shooting fourteen-year-old Joe Wilson through the foot and killing the boy 's horse . All chaos broke loose as Mancos Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the whites they were seeking ; there was no reason to harm them . Another Ute was shooting at the second rider who was galloping away . Cattle were bellowing and milling wildly about . Charlie , who never thought of anything but food , shot two of the fattest cows and wanted to quarter them . The larger rider , Irvin , older brother to Joe , was in the trees and headed for cover when a bullet felled his horse . Terrified , he started running cross country for the Coyote Ranch . The man who had shot Joe walked up to him and kicked the wounded boy in the stomach . As he grimaced in pain , the Ute shot off his nose , the bullet going into the side of his right eye . In quick council , the rest of the men wildly argued with each other over the stupid , unplanned actions of the impulsive few . Chief thought ironically how the leaders were forced to conform their plans to these irresponsible men . After consideration , they decided they must follow the escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | The group . found Irvin 's tracks and began following . Sick to his stomach and ashamed at being so , Chief had no choice but to follow . At the brow of the hill he looked back and saw the young boy moving slowly across the rocky terrain . " What is this all about ? " Chief asked , but he and Lightning were the only ones to hear the searching question . Joe was fifteen miles away from his home , Moab , but he realized that somehow he must either reach the town or die . Half-blinded , he crawled over the rough ground , getting cactus in his hands and legs . Finally , defeated , the boy gave up and sank dying in the heat of the high sun . Two Ute women from Little Chief 's band were out searching for a couple of cows to steal for camp meat when they found Joe . His body was swollen by the stickers and he was unconscious , but still alive . The women knew the boy 's family , and remembering the kindnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pear spines . Then , with one woman holding him on her horse and the other following , they made their way to Moab where Joe was laid in an arroyo . The women hurried back toward the LaSals to join their camp and finish stealing the cows as they had originally intended . Refreshed , the boy soon regained consciousness and crawled the short distance to his home . As Joe 's mother cared for his wounds , his father rounded up a posse and they started for the ranch , intending to kill any Indian they saw , as they believed Irvin was dead . In late afternoon , when they reached Coyote Ranch , they found Irvin worn out from a terrifying night of dodging the Utes , but safe with the other cowboys . The Indians had turned back at the sight of added opposition and were united in their decision to leave the territory , returning to their refuge , Elk Mountain .  | Wintertime stalked the wickiups , and the cold wind growled low in its throat at the occupants , threatening to steal all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Chief squatted by the small blaze he had kindled in an effort to keep warm , he wondered if summer had really ever been . What had happened to the sun that it never showed its face any more ? Every day was the same ? gray , dismal , cold . This country , Yellow Jacket , was colorless and drab compared to Copper Canyon and the area west . The lack of beauty must be caused from the lack of sunshine . This could be Winter 's home . Shivering at the thought , Chief rose to go find Lightning . Anything would be better than sitting here huddled over a hungry , constantly dying fire . He enjoyed riding back toward the mesa to the west and exploring among the rock ruins there . When the Utes came from Elk Mountain toward McElmo , they had circled miles out of their way to skirt cliff dwellings and rock houses of an ancient people . Their attitudes were of caution as they touched on ground surrounding the burial area of a civilization past . With the curiosity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , returning secretly to these forbidden dwellings . His excitement overcame his fears of the unknown until he almost felt a kinship to the abandoned elements . Lightning carefully picked his way over the loose rocks and around the large boulders . There was no evidence of any sort of trail or road . Contemplating this , Chief was certain these ancients traveled by foot rather than by road as was told by the traces of another people who lived near Elk Mountain . Above him rose the wall of the canyon . Built into a large , sheltered pocket was a carefully camouflaged rock wall enclosing a multi-roomed house . The weathered path to the entrance of the cliff house was steep and  | hard to climb . Chief tied his horse to some brush lining the wash at the bottom of the canyon and began the arduous climb . The long-vacated dwelling was well protected from the weather , its masonry as perfect as though it had been built last year . Chief wondered about the people who built these homes . Their position guarded them from attackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill furnished drinking water and the wash had been used to water the crops , evidence of which still remained . There were wild potatoes growing at terraced intervals down the hillside and at the base of the canyon wall . As Chief crawled through a small doorway , a dry , musty smell greeted him . The warmth of the building spread its folds protectingly around his frozen limbs . The rooms of the house there were a mute record of an industrious people . He went from room to room investigating the mysterious house , as he had twice before . Chief had uncovered a partially protruding patate used to grind large quantities of corn . Corn cobs were scattered as the rats had left them and he could envision how the earlier contents of the open pots were stealthily removed by scurrying animals . Bits of woven clothing scattered about the rooms and the dry shells of squash in one storage room indicated that the ancient occupants were proficient farmers , industrious and civilized . What had caused these people to leave their homes ? This question was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The clear spring promised water for eternity and its persistent drip , drip , drip denied ever having gone dry in past centuries . The manner in which the homes were abandoned told the viewer of a hurried exit . Perhaps they were fleeing from an enemy . The second time he had ventured to the ruin , Chief had discovered a partly covered skeleton at the base of the cliff , the skull broken by a stone ax , still deeply imbedded . This had decided the boy that it was alien forces that drove the cliff dwellers from their homes . He wondered where they had fled or if they had all been destroyed . As the Utes trekked around the ruins on their journey to McElmo , Chief had remembered how the Navajos , too , had avoided the ruins tucked away in the side walls of canyons and on the mesa tops . Before this , he had accepted this without thought , as he had other parts of his  | past ; but the age he was entering demanded that he ask questions and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Utes avoided the ruins , who the people were and what had happened to them . Hatch , uneasy at being asked so many solemn questions demanding serious answers , was curt in his reply , " Too long ago for me to remember . I do n't know ? maybe they were Pueblo people . Their gods still watch over their canyons because some day these people will come back . " The short explanation had not been satisfying , and at the first opportunity Chief had returned to the canyon , carefully approaching to test out the theory whether extra gods might be watching over and protecting the homes from intruders . Tracing the pattern of the mud in the rock , Chief remembered Hatch 's statement and deliberated over his own presence in the " preserved homes . " He did not feel any fear of the Pueblo gods ; instead he felt a quite unexplained peace when at this cliff dwelling or on the mesas nearby . The gray light was fading ; night would soon be covering the land with a dark blanket . Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , and headed for the place he called home . His absence was not questioned as he joined the group around the fire . The men were playing a card game they had learned from the Mexicans . The three who had participated in the LaSal skirmish were bragging about their shared experience to a group of children . Now the initial fright had worn away and these three were safe in their home territory , the incident had become blown out of all proportion ? a victory above all other victories . In excited tones they recaptured the moment of decision when the small boy had been knocked from his horse as the animal had fallen from a well-placed shot . The other boy who escaped was allowed his life only because of the goodness and mercy of the storytellers . Chief felt a ghastly sickness rising in his belly . These braggarts ' appetite for adventure was tantalized by the incident . They craved the excitement generated by their actions and justified these acts because of the encroachment of a different kind of people into an area where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn to adventure as any boy , but he could not understand where taking another person 's life was an achievement , or something to be proud of . Death had brought only loneliness . If the Navajo and the Ute could forget problems of the past and look to a better future , they would surely be better for the effort . Other people coming to make beneficial use of the unused lands formerly inhabited by the ancients should n't pose a threat unless their existence was threatened . It was a strange thought . Maybe the whites were really the Pueblos mentioned by Hatch , returning to their scattered dwellings . One thing was certain . The feeling in the abandoned stone houses was similar to the feeling of peace he had experienced when with Kumen and Mary .  | By the time winter 's grip released its icy hold on the land , it was far into April . The Utes had been held captive under the season 's supreme rule , forbidden to move toward Elk Mountain earlier because of the deep snows . Suddenly winter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk with sunshine . Nature 's cool retardant had relinquished to the ageless freedom renewed each spring , and nothing could hold them back . Children danced in the warm waves of sunshine , their sparsely covered brown skin welcoming the lack of cumbersome winter clothing layered on to shun the cold . Their gay hilarity was contagious ; everyone was filled with the energy of youth . They reached Allen Canyon in good time , but no one wanted to stay . It was still chilly at night and they could not bear the thought of settling into a routine ? not just yet . Encouraging the leaders to head back south toward the San Juan River took little effort , and the younger men almost smacked in satisfaction as they set the pace , proving their independence and leadership potential . The fifth night in May they made camp in the Butler , west of the new town of Bluff , where many of the wagon-train Mormons had settled . Their energy somewhat sapped , they lingered over a heavy breakfast and sighed into mid-morning , finally decided not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the afternoon a band of Colorado Utes , headed southwest , spotted their camp and invited themselves to join the San Juan group . They pushed a large herd of fine horses into a box canyon and settled down to an early evening meal . Mancos Jim 's band eyed the horses with envy and listened as the Colorado Utes told a story to widen the eyes of the most experienced in their group .  | Four days cattier , they had been at Paiute Springs on Cedar Point . They camped near a horse ranch run by a man named John Thurman , who had invited a prospective buyer named May and his companion , Byron Smith , to the ranch . May and Smith had come early one morning , loaded with paper and silver money , to buy some of Thurman 's horses . The men had been careless in displaying their wealth and , seeing such opportunity , the Utes had opened fire on the three men , killing May in the clearing by the corral and Thurman near the cabin door , but Smith managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the others ransacked the cabins for anything of value and then set fire to everything that would burn . The Indian who had followed Smith had not returned , but they felt that eventually he would catch up . None of them suspected that Smith may have killed their companion and escaped . Proof of the Utes ' story was the near hundred head of the fine horses , and the abundance of money which they flashed before the Elk Mountain group with relish . Mancos Jim was quick to remind them that the horses traded on the LaSal Mountains last year had been reclaimed and if the owner of their herd was dead , the Colorado Utes owed his band repayment of those lost on the LaSal . The usually greedy Colorado band became generous in their wealth and relinquished some of the horses and money to Mancos Jim , Hatch and Polk to spread among their band as they saw fit . Chief had been watching the whole affair with keen interest . The raiders carried an exciting aura with them that was hard to escape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of well-bred horses , all at little cost . Three humans they cared nothing about was small trouble for such a reward , and besides , they had proven their superiority to the white man . Mancos Jim 's followers were quick to catch the carefree , devilmay-care attitude generating a need for excitement . When some of their group suggested going and taking the Mormons ' horses over in Butler , the idea was welcomed with generous overtures.  | A slender young Paiute traveling with the ( ' oloradu l ) tes turned to Chief . " Are you going with us ? " Chief looked at the young man carefully . Earlier someone had called him by Sowagerie and he 'd vehemently insisted his name was Posey . He seemed to be almost sulky in his relations with his companions and they treated him as an unwanted thorn . Chief picked up that Posey traveled with the Colorado band only rarely . The question put into words what Chief had been debating . He did n't want to miss out on any excitement , but he knew what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will not steal their horses . " Posey laughed garrulously and almost hissed , " Where you from , you love the Mormons ? " " I 'm from Navajo Mountain . " Posey 's jaw dropped and he stared at Chief . " I lived at Navajo Mountain . No Paiutes lived by us but Mike . You could n't have lived there . " " I was raised by the Navajos and we did n't allow intruders . How could you have lived near Navajo Mountain ? " At this Posey stared in disbelief , then turned and moved away . Although Chief was relieved to be rid of him , he was curious at Posey 's statements . If he had lived near Navajo Mountain , it must have been in the northwest canyons close to the river . He decided to avoid the Paiute in the future . The fevered gathering of Utes was ready to leave . Several of the men were turning their horses in circles , waiting for someone to take the lead . For a few moments no one seemed willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels into his pony 's side and raised one arm in a tight-fisted gesture . The brown gelding whirled , snorting its impatience as it raced south , leaving the next horse a cloud of dust to follow . Chief could not see Charlie , but he could hear the fat Ute 's distinguishable laugh , " Tee-hee , tee-hee , tee-heeaw ! " It was louder and higher pitched than usual . The resounding beat of the hooves gradually diminished as the  | group rode over the rolling hills and slipped down through a narrow crevice that led into a short-cut canyon . Long after they were gone , Chief could hear Charlie 's " Tee-hee " and he nervously turned the situation over and over in his mind . At first he considered going and warning the Mormons , but he was not familiar with the territory and , too , there was Posey 's snickering voice echoing , " You love the Mormons , you love the Mormons . ... " " I do n't love them ! " Chief cried out loud , then covered his ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the Mormons had done was to feed him , and his Ute cousins had done that . Still he felt more inclined toward Kumen and Mary than any of his half-relatives . " I would not go to steal Mormon horses ? nor any other horses . I would not want anyone to take Lightning . " His reconciliation with himself eased the condemning frustration and he stared at the horizon , waiting for the others to return . When the crazed Utes reached the bench they found one lone man tending the herd . Fearing repercussions , they did not shoot him , but aimed over his head to shoot and send him racing over the hill . The white man was Jens Nielson and he knew better than to tangle with this sour bunch . Instead of trying to stop them from taking the horses , he headed to Bluff to gather a posse . Charlie laughed at the white man 's disappearance . " Tee-hee , of man run like scart rabbit ! " Rounding up the horses was simple fun and the men smacked their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still stay the night in their camp , adding these Bluff horses to the others in the canyon . If they left early in the morning they could be long gone before the Mormons were united enough to follow . Or so they planned , but their habitual tardiness was not the only factor that proved them wrong . The next morning one of the Ute men guarding the horses in the canyon rode hurriedly into camp . Shouting , he informed the other men that fourteen armed whites were cutting out the Bluff horses . 82 Srlent Thunder  | Hours later the men all returned , empty-handed and closedmouthed . None of them wanted to tell what happened , but finally the story came out . The posse showed no fear as they demanded through John Gover , their interpreter , that the horses be returned . Guns were drawn on both sides and everyone seemed to stop breathing as they considered the situation . Here were fourteen men with a whole town aware of their whereabouts . Even if they could take these white men now , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . They had sat unmoving , watching the posse cut out the animals . Then one of the Mormons had claimed two of the horses being ridden by Ute men . The Indians riding the horses refused to given them up and the Mormons refused to leave without them . Finally , with a resolution to pay back the colony for this indignity , the two men gave up the horses to their owner . Chief was relieved there had been no fight . He was burning with curiosity , though . Was the man named Kumen among the posse mem-bers ? There was no one to ask but the ill-tempered Hatch , who , as Chief expected , was greatly annoyed at the question . He kicked the dirt as Chief described the small-framed man and then grunted in recognition , " Short man , tall spirit . " The groups split and Mancos Jim 's band went on up Butler . The disheartened Utes found their revenge by killing some of the settlers ' cattle and feasting merrily on the better parts of the carcasses . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate resentment toward the Mormons and was cause for a large celebration that extended far into the night . Chief drifted to sleep listening to the low chants and muffled drumming . Morning finally came , but he had slept little , feeling completely exhausted from the excitement and tension that had held the camp in an unnatural state . The rest of the camp evidently felt the same way , for they snapped and growled at each other at every exchange . Having little else to do and still not wanting to return to their summer home , the Elk Mountain band decided to rejoin the Colorado  | Utes and go with them beyond Allen Canyon to Indian Creek and the LaSal Mountain . As the combined group neared the LaSals , an angry posse of cowboys came up hot on their trail , determined to regain the stolen Thurman horses . Not far behind the cowboys was another posse consisting of Fort Lewis soldiers and other Colorado volunteers bent on revenging the deaths of John Thurman and Richard May . This party was headed by Captain Dawson , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Intent on justice and revenge , if these opposites go together , Dawson 's party cut across country and intercepted the Utes before the cowboys caught up . " It was my brother died , and I 'll get ten of them for every bullet that they fired at Alderson 's Ranch . " Tall and blonde , Billy May was not a boisterous bragger ; rather , he was a quiet man , intent on doing what he said . The other volunteers silently applauded his words ? they had no personal reason for being along other than duty , but they respected May 's feelings and his cause . Dawson and May 's men closed in behind and the Utes stopped to make ready . The Indians were well acquainted with the country and had yet to find any whites to be afraid of . As May inspired his volunteers with sentimental causes , the Ute leaders were studying their defense . After planning through the night on each step they were to take , Captain Dawson sent fifteen men ahead of his main troops to check out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mesa where a winding gulch cut deep into the sandy soil . Opposite was a low hill covered with scrub oak and small boulders . As the men cautiously advanced , they were met with a barrage of bullets . It seemed every rock and bush concealed a rifleman . Four of their number fell dead as the other eleven raced on toward the gulch where they were protected somewhat , even though cut off 84 Silent Thunder  | from the main group back on the mesa . Dawson 's remaining men were firing ineffective bullets in their comrades ' defense , but were powerless to help as the Indians crawled towards the gulch , where they managed to kill four more of the men before night interfered . Under the cover of darkness , the remaining seven men rejoined the main party . Richard May considered the situation , one that had to improve , and was determined to try again , but the other soldiers and volunteers refused , their appetites for adventure having waned at the deaths of their comrades . Aware that the other group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their journey toward the LaSals with haste , abandoning their slow-moving goats on the way . Near the mountain , they came upon two brothers herding cows and added these to the growing list of whites who met an early death . The younger men who enjoyed fighting were ready to continue and wipe their old country clean of the white intruders , but some of the older leaders held back , and when uncertainty developed into indecision , the San Juan Utes turned toward their home on Elk Mountain .  | Hatch would n't trust either of his valuable rifles to any of his household , for which Chief was grateful , as he did n't want to become involved with the fight against the whites . Now on the run with the rest of the tribe , he reflected seriously on the past year . He was tired of the irresponsibility exemplified by those who sought to plunder and raid , depending on the efforts of others for a livelihood . He longed for the old feeling of accomplishment , of having worked for something worthwhile and the contentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people must have changed from when she knew and lived among them . Their heads and hearts were now turned by the wealth of others . Riding toward the southwest , Chief gazed into the cloudless blue sky and thought of how he would turn from this present life to a better way . Maybe the white man , Kumen , could help as Chief 's father had said . He wanted to go and talk with the man and decide for himself if this was to be . With this desire burning in his heart , Chief approached Hatch with his wishes . The powerful man laughed in his face . " Last year you came begging for food to eat and clothes to wear and a place to sleep . You think now you can leave like a slinking coyote who takes from us and then runs away ? Who will tend my horses and help with my families ? You will not go . If you do , I will follow and bring you back . " Chief knew Hatch would do as he promised and so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression , just following and doing as he was told , though secretly hoping for a way to part company with Hatch and his quarreling women . Three long years passed ; monotonous days extended to months eased only by moving from one campground to another , eating the white man 's beef , telling and retelling stories of their encounters with the Mericats. 86 Silent Thunder  | When no whites were around to torment , or their horses too well guarded to steal , some of the more militant Utes would cut out the tongues of unwatched cattle , leaving them to starve , or would whittle their ears and tails off close to the cows ' bodies , leaving the bawling animals to roam aimlessly about , tormented by flies that swarmed around the wounds . The growing number of slaughtered and maimed livestock added fuel to the cattlemen 's already edgy tempers and finally one spring day in upper Montezuma , the pent-up feelings broke loose . Hank Sharp , a cantankerous cowboy , recognized a horse stolen from one of the Lacey Company riders . He tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unintelligible shouts of Brooks , the Indian who claimed the horse . As Brooks moved to stop him , Hank drew his gun . " I 'll shut you up , " he cried , as he shot Brooks in the mouth , the bullet going out the back of his neck . Pandemonium reigned as the cowboys and neighboring camp of Indians joined in the quarrel . Bullets sliced the air and shouts of foul nature sewed it up again . Chief helped gather the women and children to a nearby grove , where they would be safe , his heart sinking at the thoughts of another skirmish and the following flight that it would entail . Outnumbered , the cattlemen withdrew , leaving two Indians dead and several wounded . As the Utes were gathering together , the mounted cowboys raced for the roundup grounds three miles west , hoping to reach the supply wagons and move out before their adversaries were collected . Arriving too late , they discovered their camp in a shambles . Shots rang out and two of their mules hooked to the wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on horseback moved on to camp . Fighting the fire that engulfed their wagons and corrals was as useless as defying the Indians . The stench of burning grain filled the air as the cowboys desperately salvaged what little else remained . Mancos Jim and the others , having done enough for one day , took their people and headed for Hammond Canyon . Meanwhile , the defeated cowboys went to Fort Lewis to enlist help from the cavalry . Silent Thunder 87  | A week after the skirmish they were ready to trail the Utes and have to fight to the finish . As they neared where the Utes usually camped , they thirsted for the coining fight , but were disappointed to find the Indians had moved over the Elk into White Canyon and beyond , where no white man had successfully ventured . A decision was made to continue after the Indians and teach them a lesson once and for all . Throughout the pursuit the soldiers and cowboys were constantly at each other 's throats . Each could have turned the other over to the enemy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the July heat , their tempers were not subdued by any means and when they reached a place in the trail where the cliff loomed above them , having only a narrow pass at the top , they stopped in defeat . The commanding officer looked sullenly at the barrier . " We ca n't go any further . One Ute could pick us all off from that high pass . I 'm taking my men and turning back . " Rowdy Wilson , a cowboy of daring qualities , turned to the whole cavalry with a taunting sneer . " You 've been as skittish as cats in a roomful of rocking chairs ever since we began the chase . Now you get close to the quarry and you want to turn your tails and run . By hell , go on back . I 'll take on the whole tribe by myself . " His conscience tweaked by this accusation , an army scout named Worthington , who had never seen any real action since he joined , spoke up in the army 's defense . " Hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Utes ' afore I do . " Up the trail he led , with Wilson on his heels , but they had only reached half the distance to cover when they were fired on from the boulders above . Both went down badly wounded and lay where they had fallen . The scout in his heavy blue coat cursed the hot sun and called to his companions to come and get him or for Rowdy to crawl up the trail to help him . Rowdy was facing the canyon and could see it would be impossible for the others to venture from their protecting cliff without being shot . " They ai n't coming , Worthington . Probably head for home as soon as night comes . Damn it , what we doing stretched out on the ground like this ? Too early in the afternoon to be napping . " Silent Thunder 89  | Worthington ignored the cowboy 's attempt at humor and persisted in calling for a drink of water as the long hours dragged by . Chief , hidden in the rimrocks alongside Hatch , could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influential relative , Hatch , and begged him to talk Mancos Jim into moving on and letting the white men get their wounded and return home . " They wo n't follow us any further . They would n't dare . " Hatch hit the boy full across the face , knocking him into a sharp , jagged rock . " Still soft on the whites , are you ? " Hatch yelled . " Stay hack out of the way . " Chief cried out in pain , a wide , deep cut spilling blood down his shoulder . Hatch never even turned his head from watching the white men , his ring of amusement widened at the thought of quieting the bothersome boy . Night came and Rowdy thought he heard movement from his partners , who he hoped would come for him , but his comrades were climbing from their cliff of safety and silently melting into the precious arms of darkness . The suffering cowboy whispered hoarsely to the man near him , who had n't moved for some time . " Hey , Worthington , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apology was cut short as several of the Utes came to finish off their day 's activities , planning then to move further into the mossback country to wait out the memory of the forgetful whites . There was one thing the Indians had learned when dealing with these strange , lightskinned people . The white men would chase and attempt repercussions on the Utes collectively , but they soon forgot and went back to their respective duties . Thereafter , the band could individually drift to town as if nothing had happened .  | The small band of Utes , once again victorious and safe in the recesses of their fathers ' lands , settled back into apathy , daring life to hand them experiences not to their choosing . Inner squabbles between families occupied most of their energy and time . Posey attempted to win Polk and Hatch 's sister , Tuna , by constantly following these older men and taking their side of any argument . Polk could n't stand having the constant attention from Posey and became more and more severe with him . Chief , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that he was raised in the canyons north of Navajo Mountain with a band of Paiutes from western Utah . Finally , the active Hatch , too nervous to enjoy this dull retreat , went north to visit with his cousins ? the Uncompaghre Utes . He boasted loudly of the matchless Ute strength and their unconquerable domain . Afraid of being implicated in his acts , the more peaceful Uncompaghres turned Hatch over to the government authorities . The handsome Ute was tried on circumstantial evidence , but convicted on his own admittance of having killed three men and was sentenced to serve one year in prison . At this unexpected piece of news , Chief lost no time in escaping the grasp of Hatch 's high-strung wives . As he gathered a few meager belongings and rode away , Chief wondered if Hatch may have chosen jail just to get away from the bickering women , but on a more serious note he silently thanked these women for the past four years of the best care they knew . He followed the now-familiar paths southeast to the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kumen , hoping he would still be in Bluff . Chief had n't forgotten about his desire to see if the white people could help the Indian find a better way of life , as his father had suggested years ago . Silent " Thunder 91  | Though he had never actually seen Bluff , Chief had camped close to the settlement several times . Now , viewing the town from the high sandstone cliffs bordering Cottonwood Wash , he was disappointed and yet surprised . Disappointed because the town did n't have the fine rock houses he had come to believe that Kumen and the Mormons would build . Surprised at the pleasant atmosphere radiating from the town . Though the houses were of adobe or logs , with sagging earthen roofs , each yard was impeccably clean and the green trees were cool-looking and inviting . There were two young girls getting water from a spring and Chief guided Lightning toward them , not really knowing how he was going to ask these girls where to find Kumen . His English consisted of a few cowboy words and judging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't sure he should repeat them . When the two girls saw the Indian riding toward them , they screamed and ran for their home down the trail , leaving their buckets filled with water on the trail . The high-pitched screams frightened Chief as much as his sudden appearance startled them . His first impulse was to look behind him and see who or what had been so menacing . Realizing it was himself , Chief laughed out loud with relief . He had been so nervous about approaching white people , their reaction had not been his foremost thought . He drank of the cool , sweet water and picked up the buckets ; then , leading his horse , walked toward the place the girls had run into . The door and the windows were shut up tight , with six faces staring at him through the kerosene-blackened glass . With ceremony he set the water by the gate and walked on down the dusty road . A new-looking building cut out of sandstone loomed above the rest of the one-story structures . Looking more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was where Kumen would live , if still in Bluff . A hitching post was located at the edge of the dirt road in front of the large building . Chief tied Lightning to the post beside two Navajo ponies and walked to open double doors on the street side . He found it difficult to see after being in the bright sunshine and stumbled over a Silent Thunder 93  | warped board in the floor , then stood motionless as his clumsiness was met with several loud guffaws . As his eyes adjusted , he looked around the large interior , finding the room to contain high shelves stacked with flour , sugar , baking powder , and other foodstuff . Saddles and bridles emitted a leathery smell , and rows of calico with bright , gay prints greeted his eyes . Leaning against the rough counter were two gaudily dressed Navajo men , one with a drooping mustache which he twirled with relish , still smiling at the boy 's noisy entrance . Chief was embarrassed at having mistaken the store for a house . He hesitated , deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter about Kumen . Jody Lyman watched the nervous youth with interest . His clothes and braids indicated Ute , but his tall frame and facial features spoke of the Navajo . One of the Indians turned back to the counter , resuming his bartering with the limping storekeeper over a jug of molasses and a shiny new saddle in return for a stack of Navajo blankets . Chief was relieved to find the storekeeper knew some Navajo . He waited patiently until the deal was completed and the Indians had left the store . Timidly he approached the counter , and leaning awkwardly against the rough-hewn timber as he 'd seen the Navajo man do , he asked about the man named Kumen . Jody was tickled at the youth 's careful behavior , and watched the brown eyes intently as he directed Chief to Kumen 's log cabin . A look of pain came over the boy 's face and Lyman wondered what he 'd said to merit such an expression . Chief thanked the man , then carefully pulled a long splinter from his shirt front derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway , he almost bumped into Kumen Jones . Kumen was coming to the store on business , being a partner in the San Juan Co-op . Neither of them recognized the other ; Chief having grown into a wide-shouldered , splendid-looking young man , Kumen having grown a mustache and full beard . Lyman , realizing they were passing each other , called to Kumen , " Hey , that Indian just asked for you . " 94 Silent Thunder  | Kumen quickly turned and touched Chief on the shoulder and asked quietly in Navajo , " Are you looking for me ? " Chief felt a flood of relief as the man 's face registered recognition , but he did n't know how or what to say to explain his presence . Kumen was aware of his hesitancy and invited Chief to sit on one of the stools behind the counter . In broken Navajo he asked the youth about where he 'd come from and who he 'd been living with . When Chief replied , " Hatch , " Kumen knew he could not be Hatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief shook his head slowly ; because of the Navajo way he could not talk of those who had passed into the next world . Kumen accepted the quiet and went on to lighter subjects until Chief was again at ease . Kumen desired to know of his family , but knew Chief would offer the information to him when the time was right . In the conversation Chief mentioned Navajo Mountain and suddenly everything came into focus . This handsome young man had to be a halfbreed , dressed like the Utes and with Navajo features , with nowhere in particular to live . Kumen thought of all the work that needed to be done around the Co-op Store and asked Chief if he would be willing to work in trade for a place to live and plenty to eat . This arrangement sounded satisfactory and with the terms settled , the two left the store toward Kumen 's home and an early supper . Chief was greeted by Mary and introduced to Kumen 's second wife , May . He looked at the two wives in approval . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Kumen had two wives . Maybe the white people were not so different after all . He changed that idea though as May touched a match to a braided rag cloth lying in a plate of grease . Chief nearly jumped to the low ceiling in surprise as the room was illuminated by the light from the fire . Mary stifled her laughter and pointed to the improvised light , calling it by its name in English , " bitch . " Chief became very puzzled . That was one word he remembered , but from a different scene . A cowboy had called Hatch a " bitch . " Surely Hatch had little resemblance to this plate of fiery grease . These whites were strange in their language , anyway .  | Chief soon settled into a routine . His sleeping quarters were established behind the Co-op Store in a barn , and he took his meals with the Joneses . Every day brought new experiences , like tasting sugar , or being fitted with a brand new pair of Levis and a shirt after taking the first bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose for days afterward at the smell of the lye soap . Kumen suggested cutting Chief 's hair , to minimize the curiosity of whether he was Ute or Navajo , then he would be just Indian . It sounded like a good idea , except that a Navajo rnan 's strength was judged by the length of his hair . So Chief , being partial to his father 's people after the past experiences with Hatch and his families , again put his hair in a bob at the nape of his neck . On his first day at the new job , Kumen showed Chief some of his duties and taught him a smattering of English words . Thereafter they drilled together until eventually , Chief could proudly display a passing knowledge of the new language . Early in the summer , a great flood wallowed the course of the San Juan River , swirling , muddy waters that completely destroyed the Harriman and Davis homes upstream at Montezuma and filled many of the Bluff homes with two and three feet of smelly , mucky water . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people who had been called to settle the area were discouraged and felt that this , added to other problems , made their cause hopeless . A few families packed up and left for other places and an easier life . As the creaking wagons rolled past the store , Chief asked Kumen if they were going to their summer homes . For want of a better explanation , Kumen just shook his head , sadly wishing that the Indian youth was right and that they would be coming back . He and Chief walked down to the fields where the crops had been 96 Silent Thunder  | and viewed the remains of their crops . The water 's weight had flattened the half-grown stalks of corn and buried all of the smaller plants . The settlers tried to dig away the white sand from their gardens , but little of the crops survived . What remained was tended with a passion born from desire for survival and eventually produced abundantly . Chief helped with this and as the summer wore on he would pick the scattered vegetables and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indeed plentiful was watermelon . Hundreds of large , green melons nestled themselves against the warm earth . The gardeners had no way of preserving the ripe melons , so they ate all they could and gave abundantly to all their neighbors . When Chief was in the patch , he thought he 'd never seen so much food in his entire life . One morning while picking for the store , he took the largest one he could find , still cool from the night 's chill and broke it open over a small rock , then scooped it out with both hands and ate until his stomach resembled the melon . He did n't want to waste any , but the heart was so large it was more than he could eat . He set the rest of the melon in the shade of a nearby tree , thinking to come back later , forgetting the armies of ants that canvassed the area . The next day he went with the store operator , Jody Lyman , to Durango on the freight wagon . They were loaded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado merchants for the supplies needed to replenish the storeroom at Bluff . Jody nodded his head toward the sacks of wool in the back . " Glad to finally be selling these . An old Paiute has been trading some of this to us and then stealin ' it back to trade again . He was taking ' em from the barn you sleep in , before you came . Matter of fact , until one night we put a bear trap on the other side of the hole he was reaching through . Caught ' im too . " Chief enjoyed the story and Lyman went on to tell him more , including how he became crippled . " Two horse thieves came to Bluff and stole some of our stock in September of ' 81 ? seems like we were always arounding ' em up from one thief or another . Anyway , these two headed for the Colorado River lickety-split , and there was me and Hyrum Perkins and L. H. Redd right behind them . When we caught up , they were on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their camp a distance ,  | planning to ambush us . We went a different way , recovered our horses and got a few belongings of the thieves while they were waiting for us to show . We got the horses across on our side of the river and went back to haul their belongings across in the boat operated by the Halls Brothers . This last trip we were discovered and one of them outlaws gave me a souvenir , right there in the leg ! Took eleven days to get me back to Bluff and I 'd a died of poisoning if some friendly Navajos had n't come along and doctored me . " Chief stopped him three or four times to ask the meaning of words , but was able to catch the story . Lyman had kept the account on the light side and expected at least a smile , but Chief was solemn , thinking that even if Joseph Lyman was handicapped physically , he was all a man could be . They returned from the journey just as Kumen was arriving back in Bluff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having gone to look at several sites , hoping to find a suitable place to extend the mission . They had been unable to find any situation of immediate promise , although two or three looked possible . Chief felt a deep relief and wondered why it should matter to him , except he felt there was an unexplained purpose in these people settling in San Juan . Kumen had told him they were sent to make friends with the Indians and teach them a better way . Chief felt it went deeper than that ; unspoken was this thought that perhaps they were sent to learn from the Indians , too , and if they moved too far to the north the Utes would be their only contact . Chief could n't help smiling at this , as he knew the Utes would be willing teachers , though probably teaching the wrong subjects . Each day more and more Navajos came to the store , trading blankets and lambs for supplies . Also , there was a circulating rumor that a Ndaa , a squaw dance , was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened intently to the Navajo men around the store as they discussed the coming event . A medicine man had been informally contacted and the relatives invited . The patient was a man of importance who was having reoccurring bad dreams . Not having a medicine man near his home when he was growing up , Chief had never participated in a Ndaa , although his father had  | explained its purpose on several occasions . He very much wanted to attend , but as yet no one had asked him . The day before the dance was to begin , Bluff was filled with people from all the northern end of the reservation . Friends of the afflicted had invited their friends , who in turn had invited their friends . The planning had been conducted and a decision reached to begin in three days . During the three-day event , certain families were responsible to feed those they had asked to come . With all the preparation and needed food , it seemed the store could not hold another person . Chief was busy interpreting and filling the requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargaining and bartering was cut short by the pressing matter at hand . A heavy-set , robust Navajo asked Chief for several items . He set about collecting the coffee , flour and lard , gathering the packages in his arms . As Chief turned back to the counter , the man was gone and in his place stood a young girl . Chief nearly dropped the goods he was holding . She looked so like his mother , and her dark brown eyes were settled on him intently , a half-smile accenting the blush that rose to her cheeks at this handsome boy 's stare . She was beautiful , and in a moment Chief had memorized the delicate features in a never-to-be-forgotten section of his heart . Their brief and silent exchange was interrupted by the return of her father , ready now to pay for the items Chief still held in his arms . Hurriedly the goods were sacked in a burlap bag and tied with a cotton rope so as not to fall out when tied to the saddle . Jody completed the sale , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange of cash . As the girl turned to follow her father , she hesitated , then turned back to look once more at Chief . " Are you coming tonight ? " Her words were like music , her tone so low as to barely be audible . Chief stared at her dumbly for a moment , then nodded . Although he still had no official invitation , he knew only that if the girl were to be at the Ndaa he would be too . The other people in the store were nonexistent , their chatter quieted as Chief held the girl in his gaze . A teasing smile crossed her face , surfacing in her dark eyes before she again turned to follow her father .  | The late September sun brought a warming promise of one more pleasant week before the chill of fall completely settled in . Already on the mountain secret elements had left their colorful reminders as they had changed the green leaves of summer into gaudy gowns of splendor for the great finale . Their purpose then completed , each red and orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The desert too was showing signs of fall . The clumps of grasses scattered intermittently through the constantly moving sands were showing color . On the desert 's colored mesa , a lone rider on a sleek palomino horse greeted the morning sun , casting a tall shadow that belied his square shoulders and broad chest . Chief had grown into a man ? a handsome display of youth ? strong and powerful . Inside he was quivering as a moth in a strong wind . He had met a beautiful girl ; he had met that special person he wanted for his wife . His dreams the past night had been of her , his waking hours were filled with the anticipation of seeing her tonight at the Ndaa . Surely after her invitation she would ask him to dance ! Chief could remember little about the ceremony involved with the healing rite , but he did remember that around midnight on the first night , the women would approach their chosen partners with an invitation to join them in the rhythmic motions of the songs . Kumen had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the dance would n't begin until late and it was held only a few miles southwest of Bluff in upper Chinle Wash . Chief 's early start gave him opportunity to do something else he 'd been looking forward to . When he and his father had come to Montezuma several years earlier , Nistsxaaz had told him of an ancient dwelling almost hidden in its secluded obscurity . Chief wanted to find this home of the ancient people who had left 100 Silent Thunder  | no other record of their existence , and compare their history to the others he had found . Perhaps there would be more clues in this one to add to his imagined theories . Despite his interest in finding the ancient dwellings , this took second place to the thoughts of the delicate little Indian maiden who so intrigued him . With her mental image in mind , he had little room for his other thoughts , but as he rounded a bend in the dry wash , he was confronted with a cliff full of stone ruins that surpassed any he had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed along a narrow ledge midway up the overhanging ledge . His spirit and mind were shocked into the present and eagerly he worked his way up to obtain a closer view . Cliff swallows made structures comparable to these , high out of reach of intruders and with small openings like the doorways into these ancient homes . Maybe the inhabitants were n't people at all , but large swallows . He laughed at his wild thought as he climbed towards the cliff dwellings . He reached first a single wall that rose six times his height . It was towering and appeared as though it would topple at the first breeze . Just as the thought came to him , a whirlwind blew past the cliff . Chief moved back against the solid rock instinctively , but the layered structure did n't waver ; it stood as strong and lasting as it had for centuries . He made his way through the broken maze of ancient walls , continually more impressed as he studied the efforts of these industrious people who had carried the material up the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he turned to leave , he was met with the most awesome sight he had ever encountered . His attention had been held by the houses themselves , but from their location Chief could see for miles . The vast land was dotted with brush and rocks . Washes cut winding courses through the multicolored beauty of the desert sand . Rising triumphantly above the land were natural monuments formed by wind and rain . The harsh weather had created lovely figures in its tempestuous moods . Chief sat on a large rock and in quiet reverence he bowed his head , ashamed at not having expressed with dignity the praise these rock walls deserved . As he contemplated , a peaceful feeling came over his whole being and he seemed entranced at the immortal sense of joy that filled his  | insides . He had been happy before ? happy when he felled his first deer with a how and arrow , happy when Lightning was given to him , happy at his work in the store ? but never had he experienced the complete sense of joy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in a perfect setting before him , Chief 's thoughts were of where his life had brought him . Working for the Co-op was not profitable ; indeed , he spent many hours in return for little , yet he had been satisfied . No settler in Bluff had been repaid any more than he for their arduous labors in the land they called home , but the joy of accomplishment offset the many heartaches and discouragements . The Navajos displayed the same kind of spirit as they had worked to rebuild their desolate lands after the destruction wrought by Carson 's troops and the following ravaging forces brought by nature . After several moments of comparison , Chief concluded that the Utes also displayed this need for accomplishment , though in a different manner . The potential was evident , but somewhere there seemed to be an undercurrent that drew them into an attitude of war and satisfied their needs in harvesting the fruits of others . Perhaps if their efforts could be channeled in a different direction they would become a powerful people . The Utes would surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display a united front . Three different races of people and yet their needs were basically the same . Stripped of the pride that held them apart , they could work together in harmony , much as the people who had worked so diligently to create this dwelling in the cliff . Two different bloods were mixed in his veins and he lived with a third people different from his ancestry . Chief knew that these months in the white settlement had been good for him , but he felt they had also benefited the Mormons he associated with . He had made friends with many of the families and there was an established trust . He was sure that it would be necessary for the Mormons to learn more about the Indian they had come to associate with before offering to share a better way . He was teaching these new friends some of the ways of their Indian neighbors . His father had told of the white man coming to help , but he had not explained how this would come about . Maybe Chief could continue 102 Silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was a comforting thought and it broke into his review and released his mind to the present . With one final look at the wonderland of Monument Valley , Chief left the ruins of the ancients , determined to take a memory of the geographic view with him , as well as the spirit of his thoughts about his possible role in life . Maybe it really was n't new after all , but had only now been recognized . His mind turned back to the thoughts of the maiden , of her clear , deep-set eyes that sparkled when she spoke , of her smile that was burned into his mind . Tonight he would see her again , in just a few short hours . Happiness beyond anything Chief had ever experienced filled his soul as he went in search of the Ndaa.  | Kumen had told Chief the Ndaa was commonly called a Squaw Dance by white people who did n't understand its purpose . They knew only of the social function involved and picked this name because the girls select their dancing partners . Chief was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solemn occasion in which they called upon their holy people to lift the patient above his enemy . The enemy might be real , such as a Ute or white man whom the patient or patients needed special help to overcome , or the enemy might be a physical or mental problem that required special rites provided by the medicine man in the patient 's behalf . His father had explained that this part of the Navajo religion was a combination of moral philosophy and preventive medicine , teaching through legends and corresponding ceremonies , and always making man the central figure among the plants , animals and the universe . The Navajo 's purpose in life is to control his environment by observing the beauty way and by avoiding or overcoming disease and evil feelings through the use of ceremonies . The patient was an influential man , if the size of the gathering could be used as a gauge . Many fires had been built , over which fry bread , coffee and stew were being prepared . Cooked corn in the husks and melons adorned the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family graciously asked Chief to join in their meal and after he was stuffed , he asked the man to explain more about the Ndaa . Eager to be the teacher of this new friend , the Navajo began : " The purpose of this Ndaa is to overcome the sickness that has engulfed one of our older friends and to drive away the cause of his affliction . Bad dreams are caused by enemies of the past and these enemies will have to be destroyed to bring peace of mind . " We are at the place of the first night dance and had to reach here before sundown . The preparation and the first part of the ceremony was held in another location several miles from here where my friend lives . The first night at his home is used for preparation , and when those who 104 Silent Thunder  | came together meet , they bring yarns or a robe to be prepared for the patient by the medicine man . One of these men is asked to bring an unmarked cedar bough about noon of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does this and the medicine man places the feathers and other required marks to create the rattle stick that is used in the ceremony to drive the enemy away from the sick person . " The patient brought the rattle stick with him to the hogan of the person who is to receive the stick and presented it to the father . The father in turn will carry it to the place of the dance and pass the rattle stick to his daughter , who is a virgin , as she and her partner lead out in the dancing . She is to retain the stick through the balance of the three days of the ceremony . Its significance is as a symbol of power for those conducting the ceremony . On the second night the dance will be held halfway between this hogan and the patient 's hogan at a campground , and on the third night the dance will be at the patient 's home . On the third day the patient 's relatives follow the father and the girl who received the rattle stick and their relatives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hogan , making all the noise they can by shooting , slapping their saddles or shouting . They then prepare the food for the last meal and help prepare the patient by painting his body with coloring , charcoal and ashes . The climax comes in a pretense killing of the enemy , and then the food is eaten and the dance held . Afterwards , on their way home , the father and girl take the stick and put it away in an obscure place with prayer . " Chief thanked his host and patted his bulging stomach to show appreciation . Mary and May were good cooks , especially with what they had to cook with , but they could not equal the pungent smell ( or pleasing taste ) of mutton stew spiced with the intestines and other entrails of the sheep . Night was encircling the light of the fires when she came . Chief felt her presence before he heard her , and turning , welcomed the smile that greeted him . She was even more beautiful in her satin flounced skirt and velveteen blouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcing the wealth of her family . Chief was not ashamed before her royal appearance , feeling a handsome specimen himself . Kumen had outfitted him in store-bought Silent Thunder 105  | punts and calico'shirt . He wore the moccasins saved for special occasions , going barefoot the rest of the time . They were almost too small to lit , but no one noticed , for everyone 's attention was drawn to the silver belt that encircled his waist . Chief self-consciously fingered the fine turquoise stone sets . The belt was not his . Kumen had taken the valuable piece of jewelry from the store 's pawn for his use , but no one need know it did not belong to the handsome young man . The girl stayed close to her mother , so Chief did n't have immediate opportunity to speak with her as he had hoped . The hours till the dance seemed long , with the relatives and friends visiting and enjoying an abundance of food . Every once in a while he would catch sight of the lovely face he cherished , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chanters took their places and the group moved back , making room for the dancers . The girl who possessed the rattle stick moved into the circle , shaking it in rhythm with the drum beat . She moved forward and then back , making slow progress toward the man who had brought the stick earlier that day . Finally she reached where he stood and by a signal they moved to the middle of the dance area and led the dance . Other girls started moving out , accompanied by their mothers . Chief stood back , embarrassed , realizing he did not know anything about the dance . As his beautiful dream moved toward him , reality broke in and he wanted to turn and run . Instead he stood watching her graceful approach , every moment beating in his brain and making the pulsation of his heart louder . Her mother spoke softly , but her words seemed thunderous in Chief 's ears as she asked what clan he was from . He had no clan ! The Navajos took on the clan of their mother and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life he regretted what his mother had been . Weakly he answered , giving his father 's clan : " Many Goats . " The older woman smiled with pleasure , then relinquished the hold on her daughter 's arm , telling Chief the girl 's name as she did so : " Jadi . " Her last word rang over and over in Chief 's brain . Jadi ? antelope ? what a perfect name for this graceful girl . He went with her into the Silent Thunder 107  | group of dancers , the night 's perfume intoxicating him as he moved at the side of this wonderful girl . The dance was not hard and soon he felt as experienced as anyone , moving easily with the chants . They did n't speak much as they moved together through the hours until early morning . After the last dance , Jadi 's mother rejoined her and they both stood waiting expectantly . At first Chief was confused , and then in clear remembrance his heart , which had been so filled with happiness , sank to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present her with a token or gift in appreciation for her invitation to dance . Chief stood awkwardly trying to sort through his thoughts . All he had was Lightning and his fine clothes . She certainly would scorn the offer of clothes and he could not give up his horse ! Then he remembered the belt he was wearing . With a belying smile he unbuckled it and handed it over , then turned on his heel and walked away , misery filling his soul . He had been dishonest in giving away the belt , no matter how it impressed Jadi or her family . He could never see her again . She must think him rich and handsome and clever enough to work in a white man 's store . She must never know the truth .  | Chief skirted the small town of Bluff , remorse and shame preventing his entrance into the quiet little community that he had left only yesterday with such great expectations . The hustle and bustle of the townspeople rose with the sun . Older boys were milking cows , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smoke rose from chimneys of cooking fireplaces and a few stoves . It was Sunday morning . After the necessary daily duties were accomplished the settlers would spend the day attending church services . On this day of rest mothers worked their hardest trying to keep their freshly scrubbed children in starched calicos looking semi-decent , which was no menial task . As if by a secret signal , the families came pouring out into the dirt streets , all moving toward the church building , two minutes late for Sunday School . It did n't seem to matter if the mothers started a halfhour earlier each morning , they always got to church at the same time . The dust that usually rose to meet the fall winds was , for this day , resting too . Everything was quiet and lovely . Above the stillness rose voices from the church , sweet in harmony , singing a vibrant hymn . Chief sat and listened to the four verses , his conscience burning , but his purpose renewed . Somehow things would work out . Kumen was surprised to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the next morning . When he saw Chief , he knew something was wrong by the expression on the youth 's face . Grinning , the older man tousled the dark brown head and asked what could be so terrible . In quiet tones Chief told Kumen the awful truth , then looked into the solemn face of his older friend with a thousand wishes for this moment to be over , dying in his mind , as he waited for a reply . " This would not be so grave a situation if the belt had belonged to me , or to the store . I should never have let you take it . This is as much Silent Thunder 109  | my fault as it is yours . But what is done is done . ... " The man sighed through his half-smile . " Now we must find a way to make things right . I do n't think that the owner will come back after his pawn until spring . He lives many miles away . Perhaps by the time he returns we 'll be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the belt , although why it was lost is something he will need to know about . " A duck flew overhead and Chief studied the bird , the shade from Kumen 's porch failing to diminish the discernible desire in his eyes to be as free as the fowl . After a moment the speck in the sky was gone and Kumen continued . " The store does well in its own right , but it ca n't support more employees than it already does , especially with winter coming on . We ca n't afford to pay you enough wages to repay the amount of the belt . We 'll have to think of something else . " Mary called them to dinner then and they both went around back to wash up , walking none too slow as the captivating odor of fried chicken and creamed potatoes drew them in . Kumen had wrung a nonlaying hen 's neck the day before . She had been a cranky sounding cackler , but the meat on the table told of a more tender nature . Sweet churned butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sides . The last-picked corn of the season steamed invitingly from its golden kernels . Chief thought he 'd never sat through such a long blessing . Kumen was n't an overly talkative person , but when it came to thanking the Lord , he never could find a stopping place . Six biscuits later , Chief realized why Kumen had said the store could n't afford to pay hired help , besides room and board . The youth ate more than he was worth , but then , as Mary and May were good to reason , he was a growing boy . After dinner Kumen left and was gone quite a while . When he returned he awoke Chief , who was napping , worn out from the long night of ceremonies . " I 've been talking with Brother Amasa Barton . He 's taking over his father-in-law 's trading post down at Rincon . He said his wife and baby wo n't be moving down until next February or so , and he needs help to do some fixing up and adding on . After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd serve as one for both Ute and Navajo . So if you 'd like , there 's the way to earn money for the belt . " Kumen could not help seeing the look of subdued rebellion that came into Chief 's eyes , and felt flattered that the youth wanted to stay with them , yet he was aggravated too . " Chief , I understand your giving away the belt . It was the most logical thing to do under the circumstances . Now we have a different set of circumstances , and you should be man enough to make your own way , not depending on others to right your wrongs or provide for you . " Chief felt Kumen was unknowingly accusing him of the same weaknesses he felt were in the Utes . He would not be like that . He would not lean on others ! Amasa Barton was a different sort of man ? quiet and unassuming , loud in his silent requests . When he asked that something be done , he asked only once and then expected that it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the days passed quickly . Chief worked harder than he ever had before , but he enjoyed his tasks . He was helping build a treadmill , which would be run later by a donkey to water crops . They sawed and fashioned the logs to a smooth finish . Later when the store and house were completed , they appeared warm and inviting . The buildings were located on a low ledge , safely out of reach of flooding waters . Barton brought his wife and baby to the newly designed home in February , at which time Chief began sleeping in the cold store . Amasa 's wife , Parthena , did not have time to spend cooking as did the Jones women , but Chief was happy to have more than his or Amasa 's man cooking to help fill his cheeks and chase away the gaunt look of the past few weeks . Not all of the youth 's loss of appetite had been caused by his or Barton 's sparse meals . He kept thinking about the mystic young girl named Jadi . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum of money needed for the belt was almost earned , his humiliation over having given it away was lessening , and his desire to again talk with Jadi was on a sharp increase . But where would he find her ? How could he begin to know where to look ? These thoughts plagued him constantly as he worked , hour by hour , laboring for the one person he felt he loved ? Jadi . He would find her ; he would ask her to share her world with him .  | In April Barton paid Chief enough to cover the belt , besides enough to buy new clothes and a little more left over . Barton asked Chief to stay on and work , but at the youth 's insistence on leaving , he just smiled and welcomed him back to work any time . With a contented feeling of accomplishment , Chief left the trading post , a sense of adventure guiding him onward .  | A throbbing ache perpetuated Chief 's desire to stay awake . Every muscle , every fiber of his being begged him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the reason for his continuance chanting in rhythm with the ache in his mind : " Jadi , Jadi , Jadi . " His progress was slowing but his tired horse plodded doggedly through the sand at its master 's will . After considerable travel and hordes of questions , a friendly Navajo had revealed the name and residence of the Ndaa patient . Chief had found the frail old man laying on a sheepskin , nursed by his equally frail wife . He was strong in his mind , though ? a wise , capable leader . At Chief 's question about the family of Jadi , the old man smiled and his eyes twinkled . He knew at once the young man 's purpose . Nodding toward the wrinkled woman , the patriarch spoke of her fondly . " I met grandmother at a Ndaa , but she would not pay any attention to an ugly goat such as me . Her parents were wise , though . They picked me as the best one . " He chuckled softly , remembering . " She was a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do not know the name of the one you seek , but I know her clan . They are from Gothic Valley , close to where the rabbit ears are sticking up from the ground . Long ago , Rabbit was chased by Coyote and to trick Coyote , Rabbit stuck his ears into the ground and went on . Coyote was puzzled ? he started digging to find Rabbit , but soon he grew tired and moved on , leaving the earth changed into a wide valley . " Now , as he rode , Chief thought of the old man 's words and wondered if the story was meant to warn Chief . Coyote had gone away unsuccessful . Perhaps Chief would also be unsuccessful . The man had said it was two short days or one long day 's ride to Gothic Valley . Chief was late into the second day , lost and confused . Discouraged , he finally stopped and disappointedly viewed his surroundings . Barren except for the haphazardly placed rocks , sand dunes and brush , the land had little comfort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand bed in a small wash and lay down . His  | clothes , which had been picked with such care , with the thought of Jadi influencing his choice , were now wrinkled and stained with perspiration . He smelled much the same as Lightning . Certainly this was no way to greet someone as beautiful as the girl he sought . Chief slept fitfully , his dreams filled with visions of himself digging desperately in the sand , unsuccessfully searching for the lovely Navajo girl . The next morning he felt as tired as if he had not slept , and as he mounted Lightning , he was tempted to return to Bluff . Only the everpresent hope that he might find Jadi shortly kept his direction southward . Late into the morning as he was about ready to turn back , Chief came over a rise and found a hogan and a shade nestled purposely between two sandstone monuments . Three small children were outside playing , but no other person was in sight . A mixed herd of sheep and goats were grazing further to the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chief instinctively circled toward the animals . As Jadi and her young brother watched the herd , the little brother was playing with several small black beetles , herding them into a miniature corral he had formed with rocks and sticks . It was quite a job , as his black " horses " kept climbing over the barricade . Jadi looked up from little brother 's game and saw Chief riding towards them . As she recognized the horse , shyness and confusion were the first reactions . She was at home , though , and this was a guest coming from a distance . She rose to meet him . Chief greeted the girl , relief softening his features . She was dusty and her hair a bit disarrayed from the wind , but in his eyes she was perfect . He felt concern as he recognized that Jadi was avoiding his eyes and seemed slow to respond . Had he misread her feelings at the dances ? Was this trip for nothing ? After inquiring after his health , Jadi asked him to come to their hogan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cool attitude toward him to be the lack of proper introductions and his face burned with shame at his forwardness . Jadi 's father was a squat man , broad in the shoulders and jovial in appearance . He was definitely henpecked by his more aggressive wife , who despised his lighthearted attitude , but reveled in the wealth he had  | so easily accumulated when younger . He had been called Slim by the white men and the name stuck . Added to Slim was a second name of his choice , Joe . Chief knew the heavy man thereafter as Joe Slim . The dominant ruler of the large family was like a sleeping dog , ready to growl in its sleep at any disturbance , quick to snap when awakened . Chief decided she must have been on her best behavior at the squaw dance , the social activity mellowing her menacing snarl . He forgot her given name soon after he learned it , and referred to her in his mind thereafter as Sally Jane , she so reminded him of Hatch 's quarrelsome wives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aware of the mother 's scrutinizing glances in his direction . Joe Slim was content to inquire after his health , but not so his wife . She knew why he had come , but she was not ready to relinquish her daughter to just anyone ; the girl was worth many fine presents . The greedy mother calculated Chief 's presence intently , the memory of the silver and turquoise belt impressed on her mind . Joe Slim , his curiosity aroused , allowed his wife her rude questioning , but visibly showing his approval of this young man . He admitted this to Chief freely , Jadi having been sent away as soon as she introduced Chief 's presence . The woman pried into his background , Chief being cautious to answer as he thought she would like . " Why are not your parents here to make proper arrangements , instead of you ? " " I have no parents or relatives that are close . " " Where are your parents and people living ? " Chief knew this woman would scorn his mixed blood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My father lived on Navajo Mountain . My mother came from Elk Mountain north of the river . " A heavy silence fell as the woman considered this new development . Perhaps if he were wealthy , this parentage would not be so important . No one else need know . " Do you have other line horses like the one you ride ? " Chief knew he was defeated . He did not have anything to give in  | return for the girl he wanted to take as his wife , though he felt she was worth the world . It would take him many long months , maybe years , to accumulate enough fortune to buy her . Still unashamed at his poverty , he answered the woman , " My riches are in my heart and mind . " Joe Slim looked at the prospective groom with approval mixed with sadness . Chief would make a fine husband for his favorite daughter , but it was not his place to give the couple their right to marry , and his wife would never allow it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have , " ventured Joe as he looked sideways at his wife . " Would you accept the palomino ? " Chief asked , hope mixed with despair at the thought of parting with his golden companion . " Just one ? " snorted the woman . " Is that all you consider my daughter worth ? " Suddenly this bargaining took on a new meaning to Chief . It was much more than a means of obtaining a wife . It also placed the man 's opinion of her worth . " I 'll give you ten horses equal to Lightning if you will allow me one year , " Chief stated . The woman 's eyes gleamed at the prospect . Never had she heard of such an offer . But on second thought ? how did this youth propose to acquire that many horses in so short a time ? What could she lose by agreeing ? If he did n't , someone else might . " Agreed - one year . " Chief left the hogan , unaware of his surroundings . He was not worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to give everything he could ever possess for her . Even ten horses was not enough . Jadi was again with the sheep . As Chief looked at her in the distance , he felt a deep longing and despair at being so utterly incapable of ' having what he desired most . If only he could ride over and take her away with him ? they could live forever in happiness . But it would not he happiness until he could prove his love as he had promised . He must leave , knowing he might never see her again unless he could find a job better than any he had ever had thus far . lie had never felt so alone since his mother died . That deep hurt  | would never heal , and Chief was determined not to add any more pain to his already heavy heart . As he directed Lightning toward Bluff , Chief was thinking about tomorrow and where to find a job .  | In 1885 over six thousand head of cattle grazed the eastern slopes of the Blue Mountains and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quaking aspen and clumped oaks sheltered cool mountain streams bordered by abundant grazing , providing a fat and comfortable life for the animals . Comparable to the variety in size and shape of the cattle were their colorful owners . Mavericks in their own right , they had come to the safety of remote Blue Mountain country , exulting in the wealthy land that received them . One of the more successful ranchers was an Englishman named Harold Carlisle . Rumored to be a Lord , the bull-headed man managed the herds of the sprawling Carlisle Ranch with the aid of his brother Ted . Capitalizing on the promises each situation offered , Carlisle had overcome any thought of hardship or poverty in this new land and was living grandly on the toil of others . He offered various renegades , outlaws and a few honest men employment at a reduced wage in exchange for the security isolation provided from the lawmen and starvation . Low as the pay was , it was better than the haphazard jobs anyone else had to offer , and for this reason Chief was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a year 's time he could save enough to buy ten grown colts and break them himself before delivering the lot to Joe Slim . The foreman , Latigo Gordon , whose real name could only be guessed , was favorably impressed with the Indian 's ability with a rope and the stock . Continual prying into the young man 's background , with the purpose of being first to tack on a label , Gordon had thereafter referred to Chief as " Half-Breed " . The name stuck and the tall youth was thereafter known as Half-Breed by the cowboys on the range . Unoffended , Chief good-naturedly passed off the rough men 's  | remarks , determined to get along in his single-minded purpose , that of gaining the wealth with which to go for Jadi . The rolling grazing country to the east had been easy to move the cows through , but the past week Chief had been rounding up the cattle harbored by dense brush , his unchapped legs becoming raw and torn by the oak brush that wore quickly through his store-bought pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of his wife-to-be , Jadi . If she were here now , she would know how to make him some buckskin leggings from the big buck Chief could so deftly fell . With the pleasant thoughts of the pretty maiden filling his head , Chief was soon sleeping soundly , only to be awakened by a deep pain in his legs . When he started from his blankets , he was greeted with the loud guffaws and hilarities of the men with whom he rode . They had poured a combination of whiskey and salt over the half-breed 's legs so he would " do a rain dance . " In the second Chief viewed the men , his pain was overcome by his disgust for the grinning cowboys . The Indians were a fun-loving people , but they did n't derive their enjoyment from pranks of this nature . The cowhands ' shallow-mindedness and lack of purpose other than rough abuse was dampened at the lack of response , as Chief struggled to his feet and walked away from the group of men . Making a poultice of mashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflamed wounds . He remembered some of the other pranks the cowboys had pulled on unsuspecting or innocent people . Not long ago they had tied a five-gallon whiskey jug to a young greenhorn 's shoulder so it bounced off his hip with each jog of the mule . The boy stood the pain through the long hours of the drive , but was later crippled from the effects of the bone bruise . Another time the cowboys jokingly poured bottle after bottle of whiskey down one of their friends , to see how much he could hold . Their buddy had drowned or suffocated in the alcohol . What drove these men to the destruction of their own race ? Were their innermost thoughts parallel with what was evidenced by their light-mindedness ? Two of the men had confessed to being preachers '  | sons . What were these men running from ? What were they trying to hide ? As Chief worked the salve into his swollen thighs , he worked his mind around the personalities of the people he was encamped with . White men , but oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rough in their language and brave in their drunkenness , scoffing at all thought of religion and living for Saturday night parties at the ranch . The colonizers strove daily toward refinement and education . Something Kumen had once remarked came into Chief 's head , poking at his thoughts . " An education is one of the most important things a fellow can have ? knowing all you can about several things and trying to understand them . That 's what an education does ; it removes doubts and fears from a man 's life . " Many of the cowboys were loud in their ignorance , trying to cover their uncertainty with profane language and deplorable action . It was not only the cowboys who fit this description . Other men he saw riding through Bluff had also evidenced similar traits . His father , Nistsxaaz , had been a strong man , but not loud . He had evidenced his wisdom by his silence and solidarity . By observing the men around him , Chief had gained a greater understanding of the words his father had spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white men . They did indeed have something for the Indian people , if they were a credit to their own race . They could teach the value of reading and writing , the value of living together in harmony . In turn , the Indians had many valuable precepts to be learned by those who could recognize true values , and Chief had already opened the door into many hearts by sharing the traits taught by his parents . Chief returned to his bedroll , the other men seemingly had forgotten their prank when the effects were not as dramatic as anticipated . He himself was unmindful of anything previous , his present thoughts again on Jadi and the fine family they would raise . Chief envisioned many strong sons in whom he desired to instill the thoughts of his wise father and his friends in Bluff . The next week the men were busy at the ranch , breaking broncs for added remuda at roundup . The business was rough and grueling . Each man took his turn at being bucked into the nothingness of space and then smashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silent Thunder  | Chief was not deprived his turn in the saddle ; in fact , quite the opposite . His turn seemed to come too often . The Indian youth 's past experience combined with the love he had for animals seemed to radiate to the frightened horses and he was successful in riding his first two to a standstill . Perpetually contriving new pranks , the ranch hands produced a loco stallion not on the list of those to be ridden . The men fell silent as Chief mounted the animal , then grins of delight and anticipation marked their faces . The stallion 's head was held low as Chief mounted , but as his feet touched the stirrups the horse seemed to explode . There was no rhyme nor reason to his movements , and just as Chief would catch his balance from one move , he was unbalanced by the next . It was like trying to stay on a combination of a two-thousand-pound bull and a greased pig . Coming away from the corral poles where he had tried to smash Chief 's leg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to jump but caught his boot heel on the saddle horn and lost all momentum except straight down . Landing hard on his right shoulder , Chief was knocked senseless and as he attempted to gain his breath , pain engulfed his mind . No one came to help . The onlookers were silent ? not friends to the half-breed ? only spectators to his condition .  | When Chief regained consciousness , he was in the same position as when he landed . The sun beat down on his face hot and piercing , and as he opened his eyes he quickly squinted to avoid its glare . Several men were standing above him , curiosity having overcome their lack of concern . One of the men , a weatherbeaten , wrinkled old codger , helped Chief to his feet . He could not stand completely straight without his right shoulder shooting fingers of pain like it was on fire . " Fear you 've a broken collarbone , son , " the old man commented , after studying the distorted neck and shoulder . " What does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , having been summoned by one of the men . " Well , means you wo n't be riding no more broncs for a while . We 've got work to do here ? ca n't have any broken-down loafers laying around . Pick your pay up at the main house . They 'll settle with you from the day you started . " Chief winced , the pinched expression coming more from the curt dismissal than from the broken bone . As Ted Carlisle counted out his pay , Chief 's heart sank . All those grueling , desperate weeks , only to come to this . At the most , he could buy three horses with his wages . Somehow , someway , he must find another job . With a numbing pain paralyzing his shoulder , the youth rounded up his meager belongings , mounted Lightning gingerly , and in a fever started off for the only home he knew ? Bluff . Plagued by the constant throbbing pain in his shoulder and a gnawing desire for food and water , Chief 's progress was slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next evening to reach the small settlement . As he came down through the canyon around the last bend and saw the town , bleary though it looked through his stupor , a swell of relief overcame him , preceding the darkness that engulfed his conscious mind . 122 Silent Thunder  | Lem Redd found the young man sprawled on the ground , his horse standing beside him , waiting for his master to arise and again take command . Lem recognized Chief immediately and with closer inspection became aware of the distorted shoulder . He lifted the unconscious man carefully across his saddle and led Lightning and his own horse into the town . Drawing up before his own house , he sent a neighbor boy after Mrs. Haskell , who , if available , was the best person in town to help with broken bones . Margaret Haskell was gone on a confinement case , being midwife for the small town . At the boy 's quick explanation , Thales Haskell answered by donning his hat and quickly pacing off the distance to the Redd home , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy his father had been a reason for comfort in their town , setting broken bones and pulling teeth , and having had twenty-seven children of his own gave him opportunity to function near to a qualified doctor of his day . Lem picked up this trait and knew how to handle the broken collarbone , but he was afraid inflammation had set in and if this was so he knew it would be only a matter of days before the boy died . By the time Haskell arrived , Kumen Jones was there , dirty and perspiration-stained from having worked on the Bluff ditch all day . The men talked quietly over the young man who was their friend . The small boy was again sent out , this time to get Aunt Jody Wood , another neighbor woman who was gifted in medicine and herbs . Aunt Jody was delayed in coming , but finally , by the light of the moon , made her way to the Redd home . She was met by Mrs. Redd and they exchanged greetings as Aunt Jody was led to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Place smells like a corral ! Do n't you men know anything about the new hygiene ? Now shoo , and leave me to my work . " No one knew what the woman did , but somehow , somewhere in her bag of miracles she found one for the young man , who was soon sitting up in his bed , anxious to be at work again .  | Chief was visited several times by Thales Haskell , with whom he had not previously been well acquainted . Haskell had been called to be a pioneer to several new communities . He especially loved the Indian people and studied hard to learn their language . He was extremely interested in this young man about whom Kumen had so much good to tell . Chief was impressed with the Indian missionary that could so fluently converse with him in any of the three languages he chose to speak . In past months he had watched cautiously as the large-nosed , bearded man had added his energy to the required tasks in the new town . When Chief talked with Haskell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the while he remained intent , keenly interested in what Chief had to say . Chief felt moved to tell this man about his father 's dreams and the idea Nistsxaaz had instilled in Chief about the Mormon people . The Navajos were superstitious about referring to those who had passed on , and knowing this , Haskell received Chief 's words with gratitude , feeling the honesty with which the Indian spoke . He also listened to Chief 's expressions about the Mormons and his belief that the whites could share with the Indian people a very valuable gift ? that of knowing how to develop their unused resources and learning to better their lives by wise use of these resources . " It is true , Chief . " Haskell clasped his hands in a stern manner , but his eyes were soft . " We have come here to share our knowledge of a better way with your peoples . We feel compelled to do this and our hope is that you and some of the other men who are the natural leaders will accept of these ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chief 's curiosity was aroused by these words and the intensity with which they were expressed . " Are these better ways what make the whites in Bluff different from the cowboys at Carlisle and some of the drifters who travel through ? " Pleased with the thought behind the question , Haskell answered simply , " Yes , that is so . You have seen the results of this better way , but you still do n't fully understand what leads to that difference . " This thought was startling to Chief . It was so visible if only you considered the day-to-day evidence . There were also different types of  | people among the Navajos ? good men who carried their own weight like his father , and others who leaned dependently on their associates like Kai . Now that he thought about it , the Utes also were like this . He had judged the whole tribe by the worst half of Hatch and those who seemed to lean on others instead of providing or following strong leadership . There were good leaders among the Utes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wrong family and even then failed to see the good in these people . In the future he would be more careful in choosing his companions and look for those with abilities like his father , Kumen and other capable men . But what made men different ? These ideas were confused and unexplained in Chief 's mind , yet comforting , and he felt they gave some clue to other questions regarding the ways of the whites . By the time his shoulder was healed enough to work again , Chief had lost weeks of the precious time allowed him by Jadi 's mother . He was fortunate enough to get a job with Platte Lyman to help drive some of Lyman 's cattle across the Comb and deliver them at the Colorado River . After several weeks of combing the range for the cattle , they started out , their horses already tired . It was a dry , hot trip , the waterholes and springs being low or nonexistent . Some of the wells were poisoned with dead animals and the desert reeked of unpleasant odors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not having the manpower to gather them in . At night some of the wilder steers would head back for the lake country . After what seemed an endless trek , they reached their destination , gathering in two-thirds of the bawling cattle and trading the animals for a wrinkled ten dollars a head . After settling with the men , Lyman came up short and offered Chief a horse as part payment , knowing the youth 's intentions . Chief was glad to accept the mare . He knew Lyman had bought her only for the trek and did not need her as badly as he did the money .  | Physically strong again , Chief was anxious to complete his goal by gaining the necessary wealth to satisfy Jadi 's mother and be able to go for his beloved . He had another great treasure , found while sorting through the powder-dry sand of a cave near some ruins northwest of Bluff in Butler Wash , during his convalescence . It was a series of hollowed-out white sea shells , joined together by a separate bottom hole threaded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still together . It was a rare piece of jewelry , cherished by the Anasazi centuries before . Chief had heard of these prized bracelets , but had never seen one before . He imagined the six white shells encircling Jadi 's slim brown wrist . After it was restrung it would make a perfect wedding gift , and surely she would be delighted . Happy in his meditation , the young man looked for steady work while doing odd jobs for people around the settlement . The four horses earned towards Jadi , and Lightning , were pastured on the abundant grasses of the bench with other Bluff livestock . Platte Lyman asked Chief to go with him on a cattle delivery . As they were preparing to leave , word came that two dozen horses had been stolen from the bench . Four of them were the horses Chief had worked so hard to acquire . Thales Haskell went to the young Ute named Henry , to seek his help . Frantic at the loss of his mares , Chief asked if he could accompany Haskell . Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each tribe and a solid ally to the settlement . Chief had met Henry several times and enjoyed their relationship . Clear-eyed and vibrating with the joy of being alive , Henry invigorated all he associated with . He knew where the horses had gone and in his calm voice directed Haskell and Chief to a group of Utes camped several miles northeast . He said the band was led by the Ute , Hatch , and they were soon to leave for Moab to trade the newly acquired horses .  | After a hot day 's ride , Chief and the Indian missionary reached the encampment . As always , the Utes had a large band of bony horses and scattered among them was the Bluff stock . The two riders invited themselves into camp , not needing to explain their purpose . Several hours of debate ensued , heated arguments from the Utes steaming into air as they met the cool forcefulness of Haskell 's assurance . Hatch recognized Chief and was amazed at the young man 's appearance . No longer a thin , long-legged boy , Hatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once-lost orphan . In time , the discussion drew to a sultry silence in which many black eyes watched as Haskell and Chief , accompanied by Hatch , skirted the camp and went to pick out their horses . When they reached the stock , Chief threw a rope toward his bay mare . The lasso fell short and as he bent to retrieve it , the shell bracelet fell from his shirt pocket where he had been keeping it . Hatch asked to examine the treasure and his eyes immediately lit up with jealousy . He coveted the bracelet and desired possession of it more than he had ever desired anything before . Chief caught this expression and quickly returned the bracelet to his pocket . " What will you take for that bracelet ? " Hatch was visualizing his property , preparing to bargain for what he so desired . " It is not to trade . I intend it for someone else . " Hatch became angry and then quickly repentant . " I have many fine things . I would give you another bracelet , a silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times what you have . " Chief could see Jadi in his mind , her wrists laden with heavy silver and turquoise jewelry . A silver bracelet would not be a gift for her . " No . " Hatch snorted under his breath and then begged Chief , " I will give you three horses . Surely you can not turn down three horses . Chief hesitated . He had only four horses now , after working for many months . If it took him as long to get the other six , Jadi 's mother would surely have given up on him . What good was a bracelet , with no  | one to give it to ? He could tell Jadi about it and she would be proud to know he thought only of her . Hatch caught Chief 's weakening moment , " I 'll give you five fine horses ! " Chief was sold on the amount , knowing Hatch would go no higher ; but skeptical as to what five horses . " Will I be able to have my pick ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked out two geldings and three mares , all stock taken from the Thurman Ranch several years previously . The horses were well spent from use , but in repairable condition . Chief almost felt good about the trade . Haskell viewed all this in silence , and even on the ride home he never asked about the strange incident . By the time they returned to Bluff , Chief was able to accept the practicality of his trade . All his imaginings of the bracelet were silly , whimsical thoughts . He berated himself at his past daydreaming and commenced concentrating on working to gain the final horse . One day Kumen came to him where he was working on the Bluff ditch and related an incident that had taken place in the store earlier that morning . A middle-aged Navajo man was bragging about the new wife he would soon have . He had said she was the most beautiful woman on earth . Her name was Jadi . Chief became numb at the news . It could not be true ! The year had three months left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth , he decided to go immediately to Rabbit Ears . The two distant pinnacles would guide him again to his wife-to-be . Frantically he added up his savings . There was not nearly enough to buy another horse and he had only nine . Jadi 's mother had agreed upon ten . Desperately he thought of the delicate girl he loved so much . She was worth the world to him ! He left his work and went to round up his horses . He would give Lightning too , for the tenth horse . Surely then he would not be denied his right to take Jadi as his wife .  | The wind blew sand in circles , replacing it after each short waltz . The tune it moaned haunted Chief as he struggled to drive his conglomeration of horses across the rock-strewn land . He had taken a different course this time , traveling across the mesa top all the way , rather than partly down the wash . It was more difficult because of the gullies and intermittent clumps of brush , but the black clouds gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious gamble . Chief watched for the ruins of Poncho House and was not disappointed . Looking down from the east rim of Chinle Wash from several hundred feet above , they still did not lose their majesty . Monument Valley seemed more distant ? hazy in the dust from the wind , the now dark towers reflecting the deep black-blue of the sky . As Chief guided the remuda south , a deep silence crept in , covering the land , and Chief knew the storm was soon to come . He hurried the skittish animals along , noting how the horses ' hair was standing on end and their ears flicking this way and that ? listening , listening . Chief listened too , to the quiet . Soon his nerves were as the strings of a bow and he tensed with emotion and potential fear . When would the storm come ? He looked intently at the solid mass of heavy clouds , pregnant with overdue drops of moisture . Chief moved more swiftly , the anticipation of the rain increasing the anxieties in his mind . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hogans of Jadi 's family , the moment of the storm 's birth came . A windy sigh expressed relief and the rain fell to the earth with a procrastinator 's finality . As Chief called to the hogan , Joe Slim , excited , motioned for the horses to be placed in the empty sheep corral . Jadi was not to be seen and the surprised look on Joe Slim 's face as he recognized Chief increased his anxieties . His sharp-tongued wife confirmed Chief 's fears in a few brief  | sentences . " Half-breed , I see you have come hack , but for what reason ? It has been many moons since you left with promises to return . Jadi will be married ? but not to you . She will be a second wife , a favorite wife to an old man , who has much to offer for her and to her . " Chief could not bear the woman 's taunting any longer . Disrespectfully he broke in , " But Jadi loves me ! I have come within the agreed time and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ! " " I have no need to see your scrawny ten . The man Jadi is betrothed to can offer an insurmountable dowry . " The greedy woman 's eyes gleamed with anticipation as she continued , " Can you show as much love ? If you can , you must be quick about it . She will be married in four days . " Chief groaned in agony and defeat . This woman was too caught up in the ways of the world . She knew nothing about love , only material gain . Despair darkened his mind more than the storm shadowed the outside world . He gazed unseeingly at a string of peote beads hung to dry as Joe Slim 's kind voice brought him back to reality . " Our home is your shelter in this bad storm . " The words received clucking disapproval from the wife , but no verbal disagreement . Chief did not stop to consider . He felt he could not bear another moment being in the same place with such a wicked person . He stumbled out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skin as he hurried to the corral intent on collecting his animals . Thoughts of the hogan ran through his mind . Warm and dry , with the potent smell of a fresh mutton . Staying offered security from the storm , but more importantly , perhaps hope of yet obtaining Jadi . He considered the possibilities very carefully and then his shoulders slumped in resignation . Jadi 's mother cared only for wealth . Chief hated the woman because of her greed , but he was defenseless against the evil force that controlled her . He wandered through the storm , an immovable lump growing in his chest . Finally , he decided to seek shelter in a cove he remembered to be near from his first visit . He herded the horses into it , only to find it being used by a large  | herd of sheep . ! fuddled against the wall under the dry overhang by a small bush was Jail , trying in vain to keep the rain from reaching her . He was off his horse in an instant and ran to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eternity and then he gathered her in his arms , tenderly at first , and then crushing , as his emotions tangled into a knot . It was n't fair ! They were so much in love . He had read it in her eyes and felt it in her presence since their first meeting . Was she to become the wife of a fat old man she did n't know or love ? He stroked her loose hair and she held to him , hearing the wild beat of his heart . They clung together , both denying the moment to pass , while the rain and wind swirled unnoticed about them . Chief pulled her toward his horse . He would take her . They could leave all the horses but Lightning and go and perhaps no one would follow . Jadi started , then hesitated and shook her head slightly , hot tears coursing through the cold rain on her face . Even if they were not followed , they would spend the rest of their lives running from what they both knew was not right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This could not be happening . It must be a bad dream . He had to fight down a childish impulse to take Jadi against her will as the full impact of their parting overwhelmed him . In discouragement and despair they clung to each other and sobbed , two children in the rain , their faces twisted with untrained emotion , clothes and hair hanging in wet , tangled masses . They looked again at one another , Chief pleading silently to the world and all that is right that they could be as one , then Jadi broke away , running into the storm toward her home .  | Birds sang their welcome to the first warm rays of the morning sun . The day of June 9 , 1887 , dawned bright and clear , promising to meet the expectations of those who wished for a beautiful day . Parthena Barton moved about her kitchen , preparing breakfast for her mother , husband and children . She loved it here at Rincon . They had been living at the trading post for four years and Amasa had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to work with . Out of habit , Parthena laid down a plate for Chief and then retrieved it , remembering the young man had left for Bluff before dawn , planning to pick up supplies for the trading post at the Co-op . She was glad Chief had returned . He was a good worker , much better than some of the other men they had tried . One of the babies cried and Parthena went into the back bedroom where her mother was dressing the older child . As her mother folded the white nightgown , she scolded her daughter , " Go about your cooking ! Do n't you think I can dress them proper ? Ha' n't been so many years since I was having to dress you . " Parthena smiled patiently at the trite statement . Her mother was quick with her tongue ? to Amasa 's dismay ? but she never gossiped or complained and there was not a better woman to be found anywhere . " The mush is done and thickening , and the pork side you brought will taste extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know why you think you have to bring food when you visit though , Mother . We 'd welcome you without it . " " Have to have something good to eat while I 'm here , do n't I ? " " We eat well enough . " " That you do ? when I 'm here . " The back door swung wide and Amasa came into the kitchen , followed by two sleepy looking Navajo men . One of them was Old  | Eye , a friend who had , on occasion , worked for the Bartons . It was during his employment that he 'd lost one of his eyes , having been struck by a flying piece of steel . Thereafter , everyone referred to him as " Old Eye . " Parthena greeted the two men warmly and without asking or being told , set two more places at the table . With her mother holding and feeding one baby and she the other , Parthena 's thoughts drifted from the present back to Chief . He was such a handsome young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read and write . He had changed , though , since he worked for them when they first moved here . He was happier before , always smiling and playing with the baby . Now he seemed distant ? not unfriendly , but as though his thoughts were constantly elsewhere . She sighed in understanding . It must be the growing up part of life when we realize the burdens and responsibilities of living . It need n't be so hard , but for some reason it seemed to affect most people in that manner . With a clatter of tableware , Amasa cleared his dishes and excused himself from the table . The Navajo men rose with him , wiping their hands on their already disheveled clothing . As the men went out the door , he and Parthena exchanged a lover 's glance . He smiled at her with his eyes and then hurried on through the door , going to the trading post to open for the two men and the two Paiutes who were waiting by the hitching pole . The women finished their meal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for conversation . Over the babies ' noise and the clink of dishes Parthena could hear voices from the store . She paused in her work , turning to her mother . " I hope everything is all right out there . I 've never seen that younger man before and he did n't appear very sociable . " " Do n't know ; did n't see him that much . What 's Old Eye doing here so early in the morning ? Thought he always slept until eight or nine . " " He pawned some of his wife 's jewelry last fall . I would imagine he 's come back for it now . " Parthena looked around the room . " These ropes belong at the store , I do n't know why Amasa brought them in here . I 'll take them over . "  | Angeline smiled knowingly . Of all her five children , she favored Parthena , the gentle girl with an immeasurable amount of strength . She stood by her husband , supporting him always , yet needing him always . A commotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the door , the two Navajos eyed her venomously , and her husband spoke to her in a low , calm voice . " Go back to the house ? I ' I I be in shortly . " Without speaking , she laid the ropes down on a barrel and went out , feeling the air behind her crackling with animosity . She entered the kitchen and brushed past Angeline . " I 'm going to take Amasa the gun . Something is wrong at the store . I 'm afraid Old Eye is n't himself . " " No , do n't you touch that gun . You know you ca n't shoot frontwards from backwards . If there 's trouble , Amasa can handle it . He 's as good with the Indians as your father . Besides , you go out there toting a gun and ' fore you could get it to Amasa , one of them would have it . " At the sound of a shot , both women froze for a second and then Angeline raced for the door . Parthena started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies started to cry . She could n't leave them alone ? not with a fire in the unprotected stove . Another shot rang out as she put the babies in the bedroom , praying for her mother 's as well as her husband 's safety . She ran toward the store . Rounding the corner , she almost stumbled over Old Eye , where the Navajo had fallen in a heap outside the open door . Nearing the door , she was nearly knocked over by the other Navajo as he made his way to Old Eye . Angeline was bent over her son-in-law , who lay face down , unconscious from a bullet in the head . The wound exposed part of his skull and the sight terrified Parthena . Believing him to be dead , her first instinct was to return and protect her children from the men outside . Before she could move , Old Eye 's companion returned and fired again at her husband . The noise was more terrible than the thought of being killed . He waved the gun threateningly , then turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading down toward the river while the women attempted to appraise Amasa 's condition . Neither of the wounds had proven fatal yet , and his wife implored  | the two nervous Paiute men , ( ' heeapoots and Posey , to help move Amasa to the house . Parthena turned imploringly to the young Paiute , Posey . Normally , she would n't be so bold with the moody young man , but now she had no thoughts about it . " What happened , Posey , did you see ? " Posey shared the woman 's generally cautious manner , but the circumstances lessened his reserve as he viewed his dying friend . " Old Eye , he bring a no-good pistol and want jewelry of his wife 's that he leave here long time ago . Your man no trade . They get mad . " Indicating Amasa with his extended lips , Posey went on , " He says leave , come again , Old Eye ? alone . They fight ; young Navajo shoot Old Eye and him . " Angeline shook her head numbly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eye , and despite their good sense , they 'll believe him . Parthena ? we 've got to get help . They 'll want revenge . " Calm outwardly , but trembling fearfully within , Parthena scribbled a desperate note and placed it with fifteen dollars in Cheeapoots ' hand . " Take it to Bluff , " she said to him , and then as he ran out of sight , she punctuated her plea with , " Please , oh please hurry ! "  | Chief finished putting the flour in the back of the wagon and turned to say goodbye to Kumen , who was standing on the step of the Co-op Store . His intended farewell was interrupted by the arrival of Cheeapoots , who was breathing so deeply his words were unintelligible in English . Chief knew Cheeapoots and spoke to him , asking that the message be repeated more slowly in Ute . After the message was delivered and Cheeapoots further added to the details as questions were asked , Chief was amazed . It was nearly ten miles by road to Rincon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone he did n't particularly care about , and had done it in record time . Neither time nor thoughts were wasted as Kumen found Platte Lyman and the two headed towards Rincon . Chief locked the wagon and horses in the barn behind the store , then followed on Lightning , who had been tied behind the wagon . When the Bluff men arrived at the trading post , they were met by two very frightened women . The babies were still unsettled from the excitement and Barton , though conscious , lay as he had when placed on the bed earlier . From across the river fifteen Navajos had materialized as if from smoke , and on horseback rode toward the store intending to carry off everything that was loose . Platte 's and Kumen 's arrival hurried the last one back across the river . If the birds still sang , no one heard them ; if the sun kept its promise of a beautiful day , no one noticed . It was as if all beauty had ceased . As dusk drew nearer , the tension increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south side of the river , who had milled around impatiently but in plain sight throughout the day . After the first night 's vigil , more help came as Parthena 's brother and sister and Amasa 's brother arrived . Platte and Kumen decided to return to Bluff and asked Chief to return with them . Parthena granted her permission , wishing him to be gone , but Chief felt still his obligation  | to stay . Finally , realizing he might he of more help in Muff , he went hack with Kumen about mid-morning . The Navajos had withdrawn during the night , but appeared frequently , threatening by their very presence . Their appearances continued for a week , until Amasa Barton 's death on the sixteenth , after which Tom Holiday , a massive , muscular Navajo came and talked to the white settlers , expressing his desire and the desire of others for peace . He said some of the younger men did not share his sentiments and there still might be trouble . Four days after the burial , nearly one hundred mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces painted and rifles held across their saddles . Most of the community 's men had left town by this time , back at their jobs and unaware of what was happening . Only Bishop Nielson and Kumen were in the settlement , and John Allen was in his field . Women and children cowered behind barricaded doors as Bishop Nielson walked toward the group , with Kumen at his side . Barely able to be understood in English , the Bishop was reliant on Kumen to act as an interpreter . Chief was an unregarded bystander , unnoticed by the Navajos or whites . Bishop Nielson 's strong voice showed no fear . " We want you to talk to us as friends . Friends do not talk while they are holding guns . If you want to talk , then you must put your guns down . " Bishop Nielson motioned toward the wall of the old Co-op Store , and went to sit under a nearby tree . No one moved and then Kumen followed the example of the Bishop . Silence was supreme as everyone waited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed their guns against the store , and sat in a semicircle watching and waiting for Bishop Nielson . Nielson began to speak softly , the lowness of his voice excluding those who stubbornly remained on their horses . Finally , in resignation , all of the Indians were contained in the circle . " We were sent here to live in peace , " the Bishop stated , " and we will not fight you . We can , if needed , send for a great army from the Americats . They will come and do our fighting , for we belong to the same nation . "  | A protest rose in unison from among the older men . Many of them still recalled the hardships Carson 's troops had brought in the sixties . The younger men were still not satisfied and each of the more talkative had his say , but the wisdom of the older warriors won out and it was agreed there would be no fighting . The town sighed its relief and the women brought out all the good food they could muster ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision for peace . As Chief watched the congenial actions of the Indians , who were still wearing forgotten war paint , another distinct impression was made upon his mind . Jens Nielson , the Bishop and leader of the Bluff people , had with soft words commanded an opposing army . Through their respect , he had attained the peace another man would have needed a larger force than the Navajo to accomplish . His avoidance of any calamity saved lives and preserved the dignity of every person , bringing a climax to the purpose the white people had worked these seven years to obtain . Chief desired to talk to Kumen about this power of soft , yet firm words , and his white friend 's reply both confused and intrigued him . " The settlers were told if they would stay in this area and fulfill their obligation to the Indian ? that of bringing peace ? they would be blessed and protected . It was not Bishop Nielson , nor I , speaking to those men as much as it was God . We believe in God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is why we are here . This barren country around us will never allow any resident to become rich , but that 's not why we are here . " Kumen went on to say other things , but he kept emphasizing the need for peace , because after it was established , the other things beneficial to the Indians would follow . The presentation of a single God was overwhelming . The Indians believed in and worshipped several deities . To worship only one would be less complicated , but mighty strange . With a nod of his head , Chief dismissed the matter . His mind could not accept what he did not understand and his mind was still clouded by one matter too overwhelming to allow anything new ? that of Jadi . The load of supplies he had planned to take to Rincon were replaced in storage at the Co-op and the few items left at the trading post and home were transported to Bluff . Mrs. Barton and her two children  | moved away from Rincon , leaving the sturdy structures to the elements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , the water wheel and the once-cultivated land to tell what once was . Fate had once again forced a change in Chief 's life . Left without employment , he found enough odd jobs to keep busy for awhile , but not continually . More and more , he felt a lack of something in his life . He knew most of it was his remorse over Jadi ; but he felt it was something even more . Whatever was lacking could n't be found at Bluff , so he decided to go back to his homeland in Copper Canyon and the beautiful Navajo Mountain where he was born . After this decision was made , he was happier . The trip would mean a change and he could find his half-sister , Eva , who had a son a few years younger than Chief . It had been a long time since he had seen them . Chief 's spirits were high as he made his way across the river and headed toward his homeland .  | Twenty-one years of effort by the rain , wind and sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ever-present sandstone bluffs and monuments . They looked much the same as when Chipeta had come with her family into the recesses of Copper Canyon . The red rock country had not visibly changed , but there was a different atmosphere among the people . They spoke of the past as if the prevailing thought was to erase all memory . The long captivity and return , combined with rebuilding the abandoned crop land , had developed a new attitude . The hardships of the fathers were used as a whip to justify their bitterness against the world . Chief was part of this little-known world and not welcome to intrude . After seeking information from the families remaining at Paiute Farms regarding Eva , Chief continued on through Copper , Nakai and Piute Canyons , past Rainbow Plateau and southwest around Navajo Mountain . Everywhere he looked , Chief was distressed in the sameness of this beautiful country . The soft sunset coloring of the rocks could not displace the more sobering evidence of hardship from overgrazing and lack of rain . Near sundown he met a ceremonial group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew they were going to pray for moisture . This land was not part of him any more than the country roamed by the Utes . Feeling more alien the further he rode , Chief continued through the night , sleepless from the turmoil within . When he left Bluff , Chief had said goodbye , not really knowing if he 'd return . He was searching for a place to live where an inner feeling of peace prevailed . He had heard his mother explain that she had found her peace in a strange land with strange people . Chief had not , but had hoped he would realize his wishes back in his homeland .  | Dawn lighted the earth , first with flickering fingers that grasped at the mountain tops , and then the sun pulled itself up , up , until its warmth and light revealed the secrets night had kept . When Chief came into the clearing of his sister 's home , he was greeted only by barking dogs . The two straggly , brown-maned creatures bared their teeth and growled menacingly deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman came from the hogan and shyly greeted Chief . At first he thought she was Eva , but then realized she must be Eva 's daughter . Eva followed , her happiness at recognizing Chief expressed by the warmth in her eyes . She was twice as old as he and appeared more aged than her years warranted , but she was the most welcome sight Chief had seen for many months . Eva had continued to live at Navajo Canyon with her sturdy husband and had served him well , bearing five sons and a daughter . The canyon was rich in soil and promised a good life to those who were willing to tend the gardens . Shash and Eva had worked very hard , and day by day had managed to provide the necessities for their family , but each year brought more relatives to feed and the land was beyond its capacity . It was evident from the hogan interior that they lived on the rims of poverty . Chief recognized this poverty and more . He realized that it would continue or expand in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the sheep , moving with them each day , living under nature 's rules , looking for enough grass among the rocks , just as their father had done , and as would their sons unless they were shown and would accept a better way . Chief was well treated and was shown respect by Eva 's family . He spent two weeks helping where he could and talking about all he had done in the past years since Chipeta 's death . All the time he waited for his feelings to settle , seeking the assurance that he should remain at Navajo Canyon . Instead , he was constantly reminded of the limitations placed on the people by their docility and manner of life . Finally deciding to return to his adopted home , Chief told Shash if he would come to Bluff to get them , Chief would give him and Eva eight horses he had no present use for , and that they so desperately needed . It was agreed , and Shash and his oldest son accompanied Chief when he returned . Silent Thunder 143  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their new owners and Shash and his son were on their way hack to Navajo Canyon , Chief felt a tinge of regret that he could give them only horses and nothing more . His visit home had only increased his turmoil and inner frustration and he knew that before he could solve others ' problems , he first must find peace for himself . Still restless after his long trip , Chief decided to make a pilgrimage to Poncho House Ruin in Chinle Wash . He had once felt the spirit of well-being and content within the ruin walls , and he might once again feel the comfort provided by the Anasazi dwelling . As he rode , fine dust sifted around the palomino 's hoofs and rose with the air , swirling in little pockets of nothing , settling softly , unnoticed on Chief 's clothing and in the fine lines that framed his eyes . Twenty-two years old , and gray was already showing at his temples . The crease above his brow bore mute testimony of his tragedies and sorrows , but his firm features were pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lightning a chance to rest . The horse was still his most trusted friend . In the blistering heat and uncomfortable dust of the afternoon , Chief was once again caught unaware by the presence of the ruins . The walls rose before him , shielded as ever by the overhanging lip of the cliff . The stone-masoned walls were silent in their repose , a poem written in a moment of splendor , a desperate rhyme to the living by those who were now dead . He found his way to a dark doorway and squatted in a very undignified manner , holding his knees and looking into the foreverness of Monument Valley . He reviewed his life , and spent a great many minutes in confused thought . Only one idea became clear to him . He could not find fulfillment at Navajo Mountain , nor could he find purpose with the Utes . He was a misfit , a piece to a puzzle not yet solved . Bluff seemed to extend the most welcome promise , but he balked at settling in the little community . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was reminded of Jadi . The ghost of what he had sacrificed and given his soul for was ever present to haunt him . In his mind , the mischievous brown face smiled secretly , or her dark eyes were swimming with great tears as he had last seen her . He Silent Thunder 145  | could not shake the menacing anger of the injustice brought on by Jadi 's mother . Completely worn from his emotional turmoil and the day 's ride , he slept deeply that night near the ruins , the numerous stars shadowing the walls that brought comfort and security to the young man . Chief awoke before dawn and held himself rigid in the chilling stillness that held the land captive . He did n't move until the sun was creeping on its way into the sky and then only to move closer to the doorway of the nearest cavern for a better view . Out in the desert the red flame of sunrise touched each monument and statue , setting them afire with color . Infinite in time , the moment of glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , wishing this moment would never end . His very being seemed to rise with expectation and a new hope . Yesterday was gone . All of the yesterdays had gone with the setting sun and this morning brought a new sun , a new dawn , a new beginning . The magnificent brightness and glory reflected from the stately monuments washed his mind and gave him a sensation of . renewed purpose . The stillness of defeat shattered and he rose victoriously with the morning sun , looking to an unfulfilled day .  | As with all of the other men in the town of Bluff , for Chief each day was uncertain , challenging , and exciting . No one could depend on having a job on the morrow . They learned a dozen skills and utilized them all in each job they took on . Chief was helping Hanson Bayles drive cattle to Dolores to the railroad . The white man had a high hairline that revealed the worry lines born of supporting four children and caring for his sick wife . His eyebrows were knit closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his square face , overhanging an uneven mustache . The man was good humored and gave the impression of a smile even in the long silences to which he was given on occasion . Today was not one of those occasions , however , as the man reviewed his holdings in land , sheep and cattle , and his expectations of the auction in Dolores . He was talkative , excited over a new prospect introduced by President Hammond and eager to discuss it . Chief , as the closest rider and most attentive listener , was his sounding board . The road ran from Bluff up the river to the mouth of Recapture , and followed up that winding canyon to a point near Mustang Spring . It twisted out over a rude dugway eastward , then led north to the head of Devil Canyon , where it crossed Verdure Creek and on to the northeast . At the mouth of Recapture , Hanson gestured to the northwest . " President Hammond did some exploring out to White Mesa last year ; says it 's the prettiest place he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . Had a survey made for a town and a ditch , but no one was interested . Too busy trying to get the Verdure Canyon and South Creek settlement close to the Blue Mountains going . Last June they started a ditch for the mountain townsite ? they 've been calling it Hammond after the President ? and ran into trouble with that rich , high-to-do fellow , Carlisle . He claims to own the whole mountain , including the grazing and all the water . "  | Bayles ran on with his talk , but C'hief 's mind was still on the first part of the conversation  --  White Mesa . The name had struck a chord in Chief 's memory that still echoed . He could not place the words . Somewhere he had known them before . There was a White Mesa across the river south of Montezuma , but thinking of it and the one Hanson had mentioned struck him entirely different . Bayles had said no one was interested , but Chief was . If they really were going to set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The people who came would get a fresh start , mixing together , depending on each other . Perhaps he would be able to fit into such a condition . He would be able to live close to his people , still a part of them and yet not apart from the white man 's way of living , the way Chief had become accustomed to . All during the cattle drive and on the way home , Chief anxiously awaited the time he could visit White Mesa . His visit was delayed , as when they returned to Bluff , Chief was contacted by Frederick I. Jones and asked to go work for him in the colony at the foot of the mountain . Commonly referred to as " F. I. " , Chief knew of the man , but did not know him personally . Lacking any other immediate work opportunity , Chief agreed to go . The wage was small but included board and room , and though long hours were expected , it was enough . Five families from Bluff had made the initial pilgrimage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans , they began building structures that , if not pretty , were strong enough to keep out the weather and create a homelike atmosphere . They planted crops and petitioned the clouds above to assist them in their dry farm efforts . Neither time nor skill was on their side , but their patience persisted and what they lacked in knowledge they made up in diligence . Having just left Bluff , these pioneers were educated in the techniques of making peace . They were in a new land , with new tribulations from a never-before-opposed force . The cattle companies took an instant dislike to the settlers and the attempts brought with them for civilized law and order . Chief soon discovered that the cowboys he had once worked with were a dangerous element and were now to be watched as an enemy , though treated as a friend .  | The settlers ' efforts were fruitful , and soon the new community began to take form . Roads were constructed along the high ridges so they could be traveled after the winter storms . Dry land crops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of the community . Chief worked as diligently as the rest of the settlers , but his heart was not in his work . On every possible occasion , he returned to Bluff and found solace in the familiar homes and surroundings . The new town was named Monticello , after Thomas Jefferson 's summer home . It was a beautiful town , nestled in the foothills . Blue Mountain protectingly towered on the west , its outline shadowed to a deep purple with the setting sun . In winter , snow graced the land and purified the scenery with a brilliant white . Not unhappy with the established community were the Ute Indians who frequented the canyons and lush fields of wild , high grass . A few miles north of Monticello was a favorite camp ? Peter 's Spring . In the early part of the year 1889 , this haven hosted two different bands of Utes . Cowboy was the leader of one of the Southern Utes , and the other group 's main character , if not leader , was the handsome Hatch . During one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hatch began berating Cowboy and his hunting of deer . Hatch claimed that the Southern Ute slaughtered the animals uselessly . An argument arose and in heated anger , Cowboy shot and killed Hatch . The camps were immediately evacuated , Hatch 's friends staying only long enough to put his body , along with three ponies , under a rock ledge and build a fire over the corpse . Hatch 's two wives , Jane and Sally , went to Monticello and entered Bishop F. I. 's home . Chief was down to the corrals working on a shed and recognized the two women . They were quarreling as they went in the house and after several long screams , Chief followed . The two women were pulling hair , wrestling and clawing like wild cats . Each had a crying baby strapped to her back in a cradle board . Mrs. Jones was clasping both hands to her heart , fearful for the babies and for her household possessions , but unable to stop the fighting . Chief firmly  | commanded the women to stop their foolish quarrel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After learning of Hatch 's death , the story was told around town that a cowboy , Dave Bird , had given a written recommendation to a Ute to carry and show for employment . The note really said , " This is a bad Indian . Shoot him on sight . " But the Indian was unaware and no one enlightened him as he went from place to place . Confident of the appreciation his first prank received , Bird wrote another note , when coming upon the body of Hatch , and with a sharp stick imbedded it in the dead man 's eye socket . The note written was : " Here lies a good Indian named Hatch . They say all other Indians will go the same way . " When the news reached town , Chief was disgusted with the " joke . " He felt that if the Utes could overcome their fear of death and give their dead a proper burial , such desecration of the human body could be avoided . But for the so-called civilized whites to treat another human this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out to destroy rather than to build . Later that summer Chief returned to Bluff to find work . When he came into the once-peaceful community , he found it filled beyond capacity with new faces , each person bustling with excitement , the big news being gold !  | Bluff was filled with a different breed of people ? prospectors with hair down to their shoulders , mustaches and beards that looked as though they could accommodate all brands of crawly creatures . Their clothes were dirty and unkempt , smelling of the sweat and grime of days gone by . Some of the men were cleaner in appearance , but their foul mouths and actions surpassed all possible description . A few of the strangers were not just " passing through , " they were businessmen , clean-cut , dressed in conservative dark suits , with smiles for everyone . Their prospecting was of a different sort , that of taking advantage of Bluff 's new dimensions . Where men went , they needed the comforts of life and these men considered the comforts as being liquor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's few pioneer citizens wanted their city to grow , but they were not aware of the type of residents that had fought every adversary to maintain a high standard and the opposition to the impending influences of a money-is-king attitude . Bluff was an oasis in the desert , but a dry one and that 's the way the colonizers wanted it . They did not feel their town needed the crazy , brawling fools that drunk men became , and so in their effort to squelch ideas on saloons , ended up buying off some of the businessmen , and titled it community beautification . The stragglers who came back from the hot , goldless sands of the San Juan were given a drink of well water to help them on their way . Coming at the same time as this unwelcome caliber was a man of higher qualities who had visited the city several times before , having lived on the upper mesas of southwestern Colorado and northwestern New Mexico the forepart of his life . He resembled the prospectors in that he had mules and horses packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white men and he was in Bluff looking for additional help . He required that his applicants furnish their own horses and be willing to work long , tedious hours for twenty dollars a week . He found two men to his liking ? Bob Allen and Chief . The man 's name was Richard Wetherill . Rugged looking , with  | hard lines etching his tanned face , Wetherill was quick in his movements , shifting quietly , much as an Indian . His sandy hair was cut short , but its thickness was uncontrollable from too much exposure to the sun and elements . His mustache followed suit , growing too long over his upper lip and muffling further his soft-spoken words . Richard Wetherill was on an exploring trip , planning to go into Grand Gulch , the beautiful , seldom-sought-out canyon at the southwest end of Elk Mountain . His purpose was to look for and excavate the extensive ruins nestled in the cliffs of the once heavily populated area . Bob Allen ventured with the " Anasazi " man because the pay was too good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how to say no to the job offer without being rude and he was curious as to the purpose of digging in the ruins . The party of men threaded their way into the recesses of Grand Gulch . " We 're here , " Wetherill said , more to himself than to the other men , then , " Be careful . This incline is even steeper and trickier than it looks . " There was no real trail , only a narrow strip of passable description . Each new turn presented an obstacle . Just ahead of Chief , a pack horse lost its footing , slid through some decaying shale and over a slick rock . The horse 's wild neighing turned into a scream as it fell , helplessly kicking mid-air . The horse and pack exploded as the animal landed on the canyon bottom two hundred feet below , scattering contents like a broken pinata . Four days ' ride from Bluff they reached their first campsite . The canyon held little welcome in its winter covering . A few cottonwoods , bleak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cedar and pinion dotted the rocky slopes , but the most common vegetation was scrubby willows . One by one the men would climb to the seemingly unconquerable recesses in the rock wall and dig with shovels until they came upon an article of worth . The find was carefully removed and carried to the camp to be cleaned and stored until Allen would take the relics to Bluff and return with more supplies , a job that required his constant attention . At first Chief helped with the digging , though with each passing day his work grew more and more distasteful . After one particularly exhausting day , the men were sitting around the fire eating their evening  | meal . Wetherill singled out Chief and sat beside him . Between bites of cornbread , Wetherill tested Chief 's humor . " You do n't much care for this kind of work , do you Chief ? " Chief cautiously fingered the question and then answered it with one of his own , " Why do you say I do n't ? " Wetherill had met a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Indian did not faze him . " Would you like to return to Bluff ? " It was n't a dismissal , simply a question , such as one good friend would ask another . The honesty it portrayed opened up Chief 's feelings and they came out . He thought them over carefully . He did not condemn the man in what he was doing . Wetherill 's driving force seemed to be his unquenchable curiosity at what lay behind and within the mortared walls and this required large sums of money . The collections of artifacts and relics would be purchased by monied people from the East , to be shown to their friends or placed in museums . His interest in science was also a factor , for he kept records and photographs of the work he did . Chief did not criticize the removal of pottery or baskets . It was when the party first came upon and uncovered a mummy that he became disturbed . The men were very excited and with uncaring hands scooped the dirt away from the body . Chief thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared and laid this body down to rest . The bowls and other articles had been carefully placed , meant to be undisturbed for the eternities to come . These men could not see this though . As they identified and recorded each object , they only became more excited about digging in other ruins for added mummies . " I do not mind hard work and I like the men , but not the work you do . When you die and are buried , can you enjoy the thought of a future generation retrieving your remains and displaying them ? These mummies you dig are people , once alive and not unlike us . Some believe they will live again . " " You mean the Mormons ? " Wetherill laughed . " They 've got some crazy ideas , do n't they ? " " Only , " he hastened to add , " they 're real good people . "  | The archeologist had heard the same arguments Chief had presented him often enough before , so he brushed the conversation behind him . " We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure they 're getting food and water . And we need fresh meat too . You 're a good hunter . I think those two jobs will keep you busy . " Then , almost as an afterthought , Wetherill tried to impress Chief with his own personal type of religious thinking . " We are bringing the world 's attention to an unknown civilization . Think about it . " Chief remembered the words and he did reflect on the statement . He wondered if Richard Wetherill was referring to mummies ? or grave diggers . Chief remembered the peace he had felt at the Poncho House in Chinle Wash ; here he felt no peace , only the urgency of unthinking men . The destruction they wrought on the vacant homes of the Anasazi was no different than the shooting and maiming of cattle by the Utes or the destruction nature brought upon the land by floods and fire . For four cold , tedious months they worked through the canyon until the severity of winter forced them to return to Bluff . Wetherill 's notes and findings revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the Basket Makers . Their remains and mummies were found below the level of the later residents , the Pueblos . From Cottonwood Wash and Grand Gulch the treasure numbered 1,216 specimens and 96 skeletons . Wetherill had not yet completed his collecting , as he would yet take many more artifacts from the place where Chief felt they belonged , and had the right to stay . As the ten men tediously made their way out of the canyon , cold rain mixed with sleet was falling and making the passage even more treacherous than in the earlier trips . The men were walking for safety , each horse carrying a portion of the distributed load . So far in their excursion , seven animals had been lost over the ledge ? three mules and four horses . The memory of the fallen animals haunted the men as they toiled up the steep canyons . As they rounded a large rock the trail narrowed to a series of jump-up steps . Chief hung close to the rock wall , but the footing under Lightning crumbled and the animal lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have gone over the edge with the palomino , but he grabbed onto a scrub pinion protruding from between the rock wall .  | He felt the leather reins slip from between his fingers and simultaneously a pain-filled cry escaped his throat , " Lightning ! " He was no longer a man , but a boy with his colt , a boy losing the only completely trusted friend he 'd had since the death of his parents . Past memories welled up in his mind during the seconds it took the palomino to fall . He listened with an unbearable pain as the creature he loved met a horrible death on the rocks below . Lightning had been his faithful companion for thirteen years . This loss only increased Chief 's attitude towards Wetherill as a man dealing in and documenting death . They finally reached Bluff , a ragged , sorry-looking combination , as they had gone the full winter without a bath , a full night 's sleep or a delightful home-cooked meal . Richard divulged his plans to travel on into Chinle Wash and look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of the enchanted Poncho House ruins and his heart burst with resentment . " No ! " The outburst surprised everyone . Chief knew Wetherill could n't miss the ancient location in his systematic exploration of every canyon and mesa , and this was too much . Must everything he considered special be lost in death or destruction ? After his display of feelings , Chief turned away and searched out Kumen , not knowing if Wetherill went up Chinle or straight home . His other horse had been wintering on Bluff Bench , and after corralling and gentling the gelding , Chief started seeking a new job . The gold boom was still evidenced by the prospectors buying supplies and the bustle of new arrivals , even in these late winter months . Bluff would never be the same again for any of the settlers , and Chief knew he could never be content to remain . He had lost his last and only hope of feeling a part of something or someplace . Chief was looking for a place to call home .  | The weeks and months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new day would march across the blue skies and be overtaken by the dark night that spread its jewels among the heavens . There was time for happiness and heartache , discovery and contemplation . The small communities of Bluff and Monticello fought bravely on , seeking survival by day , then snuggling into the security of their purposeful existence at night . Chief was content to pattern his existence to the lazy summer days , and although he was happy to accept what work was available , he was continually alone in his thoughts and mentally removed from the others . One day by the Co-op Store , the words White Mesa came again to his ears . In the misery of trying to forget , he had forgotten his intent to explore the mesa of which he knew nothing other than its name . The magical words refreshed his memory like a broom cutting through the cobwebs of a dark corner , and his eagerness to know more was almost amusing . Jody and Walter Lyman had come to Bluff to visit their brother Platte , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On their arrival , they were disappointed to find Platte was in Colorado and was n't expected back for a few days . They decided to wait for his return , but while doing so the word spread that they intended to build a ranch on White Mesa . The news split the small community into two factions . Most thought the brothers impractical to think water was available . The others thought them just plain fools . Kumen , who was a brother-in-law to the Lyman brothers , was intrigued with the idea , but reserved his opinion until an on-site inspection could be made . He and Walter rode onto the mesa while waiting for Platte , and after their return Kumen told Chief about the trip . " As we neared the northern end of the mesa we could see the beautiful display of fall colors on the mountain . The air was invigorating and clear , and we were enjoying ourselves as if on holiday . We had been  | discussing all of the many problems that faced Bluff , and President Hammond 's idea of colonizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a high vantage point , we just sat on our horses looking at the land that lay before us and felt the joy of living . I glanced to Walter to see him staring back to the south as if transfixed . He seemed overcome at what lay before him . I could see nothing but the trees and scattered brush flats , with the San Juan River country in the distance . Walter pointed toward the south and said he had seen a town laid out before him as if it were real . Its size was amazing . It was a truly great moment . Though I did n't see what Walter did , I saw how it affected him . He and Jody are going there again tomorrow to do some surveying . They ca n't stand the suspense any longer , and Platte is to join them when he returns from Colorado . " Chief considered Kumen 's words carefully , curious at the excitement that filled him . " Who will live in the town ? " Kumen was surprised at the question . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was asked . It was evident Chief expected him to give a certain answer . Groping in his mind for the right words , Kumen came to a realization he 'd not considered before . He answered quietly , " A lot of people , Chief , from what Walter said , but it is to be a city of refuge with a promise of a new way . I may live there also , in time . " " What about Bluff ? " Chief could not believe Kumen would , or could , leave his newly built rock home . It stood as a monument to the persistence of man , an evidence of capabilities , a denial of the land 's supreme rule . " Bluff also was settled for a purpose , Chief . That purpose has partially been fulfilled , and you will see the time that most of the men now in Bluff will move to the new town . There is not enough room for growth in Bluff . The work these people will accomplish will demand a larger area , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief was all the more anxious to visit White Mesa . He remembered his father 's dream about the white man having something of value for the Indian and felt this place might provide the realization of that dream . Later he was able to visit with Jody and meet Walter Lyman . He was amazed at the clear , strong eyes that held his upon their meeting ,  | and liked the younger Lyman brother immediately . Walter was a largeframed man with a prominent nose that improved his dark , full mustache by its very existence . Chief asked if help was needed in the new community . Surprised by this direct question on a subject as yet discussed with a select few , Walter answered solemnly , " In time , yes , there will be help required by many people for many years . " In November , after spending adequate time to understand their commitment , the White Mesa Canal Company was formed with four partners : Kumen Jones , Platte , Walter and Jody Lyman . The men began work on the ditch that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not able to be actively engaged in building the canal and he asked Chief to work in his place , thus providing him the opportunity to go and camp near the mesa he was fast coming to call home . As the work continued , new men came to enlarge the work crew and show their faith in the idea of a town on White Mesa . One late summer day Chief mounted the small black gelding he now rode and headed south , down across the mesa , looking for the spot where the town was to be . He rode in self-imposed silence , enjoying the solitude and majesty of his surroundings . Chief looked in wonder at the rolling hills cut by numerous small washes and canyons dotted by evidence of the Anasazi . Pottery pieces were scattered throughout the heavy cedars and periodically a rocky high point would speak silently of a house that had once graced the area with its presence . Chief was as enthralled as he had anticipated , knowing without question that this land and the town were part his and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of triumph filled his whole being just with the thought . When he returned , he found Walter standing knee deep in the ditch , his faded overalls and floppy hat seeming to hold the tired man from collapsing from exhaustion . " We 're making good progress , Chief . Weather 's been cooperating fairly well and it looks like we can finish for next spring . " Their conversation continued and Walter evidenced his elated hopes the way a man can who has earned the right to sit and reflect on his accomplishments .
