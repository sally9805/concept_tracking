A few admissions about what he thought was just a public relations problem <P> " A book both extraordinary and historic . The personal memoir of a life of conflict , an extraordinary life lived in the arena , a public life that ended with the greatest fall in modern political history . The whole story . " <P> One man 's view of tumultuous events , of course , can not constitute " the whole story , " especially when the man sits at the troubled center of much of the action and judges himself . Yet that publisher 's puff for a book , designated " 14374-7 General Nonfiction " in the Grosset &; Dunlap catalogue and titled The Memoirs of Richard Nixon , is generally accurate . Richard M.

It is neither chatty nor ponderous . It will satisfy neither readers looking for personal gossip nor scholars seeking profound insights into the forces shaping global politics . Yet it does move easily in short sentences and simple narrative style to convey Nixon 's interpretations of history in an unambiguous fashion , full of specific , if incidental , detail .
