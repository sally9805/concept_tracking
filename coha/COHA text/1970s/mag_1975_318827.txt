To the Editors : <P> TIME states Sept. 22 that busing has run " against the deepest instincts of a clear majority of whites and quite a few blacks . " " Instincts " is hardly an apt description of racism , a learned behavior . <P> Busing may now be a " much hated stepchild " of school desegregation , but this stepchild may grow up to be the parent of a more equality-minded society . <P> I think the goal is worth the effort . <P> Marilyn R. Palla Santa Cruz , Calif . <P> Forced busing , forced abstinence-forced anything is wrong ! <P> Dan Parow Warren , Mich . <P> Suddenly eyes are being opened . The white parents of children being bused to previously all-black schools are now faced with the poorer educational systems in our inner cities for their own children . Funny thing-the schools were just fine when all the young faces behind those desks were black . <P> Karen Holmes Garden City , N. Y. <P> We have been taught that if people are unhappy with a law , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will change it . In the case of busing , this option is nonexistent . Federal judges , appointed for life and unaccountable to the voters , have nullified all efforts of our representatives to carry out the mandate of the people . <P> Charles A.

Now those people who sup ported that illegal war ( silent majority , etc. ) are out protesting busing , burning buses , turning cars and the American flag over . <P> Mary Johnson Denver <P> The liberals in the country , by forcing busing down the throats of the white citizenry , are digging their own graves . They are radicalizing the law-abiding , ordinary Americans who have made this country work while the students , blacks and other loud-mouthed crybaby minorities have been protesting and rioting . <P> Dick Hill Seattle <P> The cure for cancer or the solution to the energy crisis might some day lie in the heads and hands of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent education . <P> Kathleen A. Moors <P> Richard A. Moors <P> Anaheim , Calif . <P> You fail to mention the rising level of violence in schools as the proportion of blacks increases . Unless the problem is faced , integration will continue to be an expensive failure . <P> Victor Jaeggli Jr . <P> Bellaire , Texas <P> The antibusing demonstrators in Boston and Louisville are the victims of something much more dangerous than the threat of blacks or whites in their schools . That something is ignorance . <P> Emmett Charles Costello St. Paul , Minn . <P> <P> A President 's Life <P> The attempts on President Ford 's life Sept. 29 underscore our ridiculous way of campaigning . Why must we use methods that were necessary 150 years ago , when the only way to reach people was to travel across the country and stop at every town ? <P> Anne Munson Rochelle Park , N.J. <P> If our society could expedite its justice system to balance its award of instant notoriety with instant punishment to fit the crime , say within 30 days , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reed Bethany , Conn.
