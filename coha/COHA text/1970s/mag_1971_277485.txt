THE FORGOTTEN SOLDIER by Guy Safer . Translated from the French by Lily Emmet. 465 pages . Harper &; Row . $8.95 . <P> <P> If the ultimate snobbery is the snobbery of pain , the ultimate snob may be the vanquished German soldier-Siegfried , in the agony of defeat , singing a prouder tenor than his enemies can manage in victory . <P> In the autumn of 1942 , Guy Sajer , 16 , the French-speaking son of a German mother , cockily double-timed into Russia to help recharge the Third Reich 's blitzkrieg on the steppes . Less than two years later he staggered out half alive with the remnant of the once-elite Gross Deutschland Division . Even in this debacle he has found-25 years later-an eminence to lay claim to . He is an elitist in surviving hardships . <P> " I have never met anyone better able to stand punishment than the Germans , " Sajer writes . Obviously he believes that Germans never took more punishment than in the Russian campaign . His self defined mission : " To reanimate with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> But blood-and-guts reportage is not enough to explain why The Forgotten Soldier has been a bestseller in France and Germany , or why Sajer so belatedly wrote it . Beneath its artillery-barrage surface hides another war-the struggle , equally intense though never acknowledged , between an autobiographer 's impulse to confess and his impulse to self-justify . With a kind of death grip , Sajer holds on to his reader , simultaneously appealing to him for absolution and denying his right to judge . He pictures the reader sitting in an armchair by the fire , curled up in a comfortably moral position . Out of anguish , out of arrogance , he pulls him down into his hell . What he is finally saying is : Do n't judge me , be me . <P> Despite a Teutonic tendency to grandiloquence and repetition , Sajer is brutally effective . He puts lice on that armchair reader , gives him an empty belly , and sticks him in a frozen mudhole . He loses him in the endless space of that " accursed Russian plain . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35-40 below zero-the temperature at which , when a soldier urinated , three or four of his fellows thrust their cracked hands under the stream for momentary warmth . <P> Sajer crams the reader into a truck next to a living corpse with his head half blown off . refusing to die . He makes him hold down a man 's leg while a surgeon saws it off . He forces him to wait in a trench while waves of Russians charge , shouting " Ourrah ! " until fear " reduced every conviction to nothing . " <P> The places have names : Belgorod , Kharkov , Kiev . Catastrophe follows catastrophe . But finally , like war itself , The Forgotten Soldier obliterates time and space into a pure throbbing pain whose only limit is death or madness .
