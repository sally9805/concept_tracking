The Chapel of Louis XIV at Versailles was resplendent on that morning in 1770 when the dauphin ( later Louis XVI ) married Marie Antoinette of Austria . Sunlight pierced the stained-glass windows , illuminating the frescoed ceiling and the embroidered brocades and silks of the guests-the aristocracy of Europe and a few lords from the colonies . It was a state affair , too sublime for common folk . Only nobles whose coats of arms bore many quarterings were permitted inside Versailles 's marble walls and mirrored hallways . All went smoothly until a thunderstorm rained out a postnuptial display of fireworks . <P> Some 200 years later , royalty 's ragged remnant as well as the restless rich and those who aspire to such status still crave an invitation to Versailles . They are even willing to pay $235 a head for a floor show and supper in the now-termite-infested palace . Of course , the servants must be bewigged , the brocade and baubles as abundant as in the days of Louis and Marie . And so it was last week , thanks to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summering in France , Lambert told Gerald van der Kemp , curator of Versailles , that it would be " so nice " if American designers could get some more exposure in France . Why not a joint showing with their French counterparts ? Why not indeed , said Van der Kemp , who proposed that the royal palace , which needs restoration , be both the site and the beneficiary . <P> It was arranged : five top French couturiers , including Pierre Cardin and Hubert de Givenchy , would reach across the Atlantic to Halston , Anne Klein , Oscar de la Renta , Stephen Burrows and Bill Blass . Together they would have a ball scarving , belting , bigskirting or otherwise adorning the likes of Liza Minnelli , Josephine Baker and Capucine . The performers , together with ordinary mannequins , would stage a kind of high-budget vaudeville called " Le Grand Divertissement Versailles . " The money ? Ah , yes , patrons like the Baroness Marie-Hlne de Rothschild would angel the operation , and people like Amanda Burden , Princess Grace , the Charles Revsons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsors . Last week it all happened , more or less as planned . But as with the 1770 fireworks , there was rain on the big parade . In fact , the preparations preceding the show demonstrated just how bad Franco-American relations can be even where NATO is not involved . <P> Worst Experience . The rehearsals were chaos , with virtually no communications between U.S. and French organizers . The Baroness said privately - but not privately enough to keep it a secret-that the American acts were " cheap . " Anne Klein observed : " This has been the worst experience of my life . When this is over we are all going to relax and have a nervous breakdown . " <P> Most of the Americans quickly got the perhaps paranoid feeling that the French were out to humiliate them . The French performers and models rehearsed first and consistently ran several hours late . While the Americans waited their turn well into the first night , their hosts provided no food , not even water . The next night , when a dinner break was demanded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a ravenous crew of 60 came close to mutiny .
