At a time when mere careers matter less and less , and poetry seems to matter finally as testimony , as one of the radical acts necessary for survival , Hayden Carruth is a distinguished figure . I mean that not in the sense that others have conferred distinctions upon him and thereby created his importance . I mean it in the sense that a single tree , or a mountain profile , is distinct through its separateness and integrity ; distinguished by what it is , but also by its particular relation to the landscape . Though he has been living and working for many years apparently far out of the mainstream of letters , cities , the churn of careers , it would be ridiculous to call his reputation underground or obscure . There are few poets whose work has nourished so many magazines so steadily ; and no criticism of poetry has been written in the last decade more extensive and searching than the reviews and essays Carruth has contributed to such publications as Poetry , the Hudson Review , the Chicago Sun-Times , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no sect , member of no clique , vastly read in the poetry of his own time and of the past , Carruth has been through the force of his own gifts at the mainstream of our poetry when it was gathering its fullest momentum and achieving its richest variety . But right now we have For You , a handsome volume , and The Clay Hill Anthology , one of the most attractively and sympathetically designed books I have recently seen from a small press . For You is a series of journeys from within the poet 's self , beginning with a poem called " The Asylum " and ending with an elegy for his father . At first look these poems embody a very inward world , the passage of a man 's spirit from psychic defeat into that confrontation with the real that Americans call pessimism . But the title , it seems to me , goes to the root ' ' ' ' of what this kind of poetry is really Vabout : a man who uses language as a . tool or weapon for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tool , honed and tempered by him , its handle stained with his sweat , 4. ' and offers it to us , as if it might be of use to us , too . There is no brilliance of - craft or aesthetic surface that can do this for us of itself ; this is a quality of poetry 1,4 that the poet conceives as functional , as a Ii way of existing  --  first for oneself , then to perhaps for others . One of the striking things about the / poems in this book is the way they trace the development of a poet 's working Ianlo. , t guage . " The Asylum " has always seemed , , to me a poem of courage , the poem of a proud man acknowledging humiliation r and ' apparent failure , yet under no illu-sion that that acknowledgment offers him a reprieve . The poem 's concerns are the -4 , collapse of an identity and the relation of that collapse to the society around the ) self . It should be remembered that poems out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that illness of the mind was still seen as a form of indiVidual failure to adjust to a presumably sane and sound society . It does seem to me , however , ' ' itthsaetlfthien pt no iest ' sp nsensitivity a wd ill i npnr o twe he ti icnhg except at a few striking moments , clothes i itself in literary costume . Ezra Pound is a figure in the poem , seen as both fellow sufferer and master , and the language reflects that aspect of Pound 's influence , which has always felt to me as sticky as candy : verbal nostalgia and hyper-musicality at the expense of naturalness ? qualities into which PoUnd 's imitators , including the best of them , have often .. it fallen . Yet distinct . and articulate images also appear : " . . . a twisted beech/Whose nineteen leaves were glittering , each/A I tear in a rigid eye . . . . " And the ' final section breaks into a different ' mode : , If love fails To soothe such pain and runs like the salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodbye . Here 's darkness and rain And a small wind in broken walls , dear walls . Here am I , drowned , living , loving , and insane . In " Journey to a Known Place , " a poem written two years later , the language becomes harsher , more brilliant and violent ; there is almost no trace left of the inversions and archaisms that oc= cur in " The Asylum . " It is a language of verbs , a reaching-out into action , into movement , a bursting of the asylum walls , and entering into regions where there is no asylum , no protection . Nevertheless , in this poem , it is only when Carruth deals in precise terms with the natural or human world that his experience comes most sharply into focus . The mythology ' or " plot " of the poem seems rather a contrivance ; I believe that its elaborated metaphors of air , earth , fire and water are used as literary diction is used in " The Asylum " ? out of a lack of trust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , as in the , undersea passage , " Aqua , " they are nightmarish and powerful . In 1963 , Hayden Carruth , now living in a small village in northern Vermont , undertakes to write a long poem ' without using the pronoun " I. " The result is " North Winter , " first published by the Prairie Press , and , in that edition , now presumably a collector 's item . The poem is a sequence of short , open-line poems tracing the onset and the experience of a winter in the hills , and ending with the compelling description of two men  --  possibly Commander Peary and his black companion Matthew Henson  --  on their first trek to . the Pole . In renouncing the personal pronoun , Carruth becomes more intensely than ever the persona and the soul of the poem : ' he is no longer recounting his own experience from one remove , looking back at himself ; he becomes pure consciousness , the mind of a man , the mind of a poet , translucent , relentlessly selective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise and varied and wholly successful . In pretending to be simply a sequence of images of winter , ' the poem creates a context in which the reader is left to make the unsaid connections between the visible object and the conditions of our being . Carruth is here using material &; so close to him in every sense , and +which he ' is so gifted at observing and understanding , that the words appear , on the page as if they had always been there ; it is hard to imagine the poem as something made . One is looking through Carruth 's eyes , yet hardly aware of his presence . In " Contra Mortem , " dated three years later , the materials of this immediate landscape ? Vermont woods , ' stream , meadows , village , wife , child , sky , night , dawn  --  are the personae of a thirty-part poem . It almost seems that this is the poem Carruth was trying to write in the final section of " Journey to a Known Place . " The celestial city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mythic landscape has become one far more familiar  --  though still at times and places possessing an ecstatic quality . Carruth , now moving among the actual facts of his existence , is in contact with the poetry of that existence as never before . And the poem is an attempt to use poetry , to use the body of the visible world , against the little deaths and the great death which thread their way through this and each of the earlier long poems . The fact that the core of nothingness , seen in each other 's eyes by the two explorers at the end of " North Winter , " exists also in " the socket/ Of the candlestick or in that/ of the shotglass look in the empty gauntlet or look/in the clamshell . . . look the fear " ? this fact , this " place where nothing is " is also the core of the poem . Written out of the most acute , unswerving , unhysterical perception of absurdity , that poem 's great beauty and paradok is how lovingly and intensely it evokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final " little death " in this book is the death of Carruth 's own father , and the breaking  --  by the son , of his own will ? of " the net that holds/ everything together . " A sensation of release at such a time is not uncommon , but Carruth 's vision of the release in " My Father 's Face " is of all act of choice : How easy ! I wonder why I took so long , learning that to destroy what could never be either right or wrong , this net , this mere order ? - is no real destruction look , I walk as I have always walked , one foot in front of the other foot . The rocks and birches take so warmly to the purity of their restoration . I see this . I have done ii with one gesture , like that .
