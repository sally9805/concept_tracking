tion must do the same . Dowd must be aware of that , for he says that a labor movement must be " political , in the deepest sense of that term " ? but he does not indicate what that sense is . Followers of a thinker who con  --  tinually explored the debilitating effects of the division of labor , American Marxists have ironically created such a division among themselves . One group , most of whose members are economists , prefer the Marx of Capital , the man who dissected an economic system . The other group , philosophers and political theo  --  rists , see another Marx , the Hegelian , who used a philosophical language and addressed himself to problems far re  --  moved from what they contemptuously call " positivistic economics . " The point is that Marx himself was in neither of these schools , but a thinker who was both a theoretician and an economic an  --  alyst at the same time . Any writer who leans too heavily toward one approach or the other loses something valuable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ysis , too much by an " economist " and not enough by a " theorist . " What might at first seem abstract and ir  --  relevant questions ( What is politics ? What makes a generalization true ? ) are necessary parts of his enterprise , and should have figured in his book . This book might well have been partly inspired by William Empson 's view that Milton 's conception of God in Paradise Lost is in fact the Devil , since God in his omnipotence is ultimately responsible for evil . Thus the Book of Job is dis  --  cussed at length and in detail ' by Richards , with particular emphasis on its dual aspect , the contrast familiar to scholars between the poem and the tale . In the poem Job is a convinced and determined rebel who receives no vindi  --  cation and is not delivered from his dis  --  tress ; in the tale he bears his trials with unbroken patience and receives the due reward of his goodness . Richards de  --  parts , however , from the accepted There is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that is the debunking of existing preconceptions  --  another skill in which Marx excelled . Dowd is at his best in just that department . His critiques of the notion of the United States as a benevolent world power , of the idea that economic opportunity exists for all , of the assumption that we are in the pres  --  ence of a neutral state which is the con  --  dition for a pluralist paradise , are all good ones , even though they are now familiar . And he writes in an informal style which is ) as rare among economists as it is among most groups who have a vested interest in confusing people . When it comes to summarizing the mess that U.S. capitalism is , one is not likely to find a better written , more thorough summary than his . When it is a question of why that condition exists , Dowd , despite his interest in history , does not Jake us as far as we would like to go . The problem is that the first task is no longer vital ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalists of capitalism ) ? and for that very reason , the second is essential . Radical thinkers in whatever discipline had better move fast , for if they do not , the rapid crumbling of United States capitalism will leave them standing in the same place. , q opinion that , in the po'em , Job is " recon  --  ciled to his fate . " Hence the theme of his book : the inscrutability of Divine justice in respect to injured and suffering good  --  ness . This concern leads Richards to raise a number of perplexing questions : for example , what is justice and why should man think he is entitled to it ? Richards is especially impressed by the " taunting , scathing , sarcastic tone " of God 's dialogue with Job , His to conceive or care- about the situation of His creature . Richards suggests , too , that Job 's choice of silence after having seen the " unutterable " and God 's " in  --  ability to be relevant " jointly meet the poetic , moral and theological problem better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sense that poetry " 1 " for Richards is the source of human judgment ; that , in any event , is the ap  --  parent implication of his repeated use of the word " reflexive " in connection with the basic issues he discusses . The resulting philosophical questions are very well answered by a famous pas  --  sage from William James , quoted in the Prologue of this volume :
