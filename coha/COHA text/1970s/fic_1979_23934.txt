MINUTES OFAVILLAGE MEETING About the Author A RNAUD ETCHEBERRIA ( 1902-71 ) has been styled " poet of the Basque revolution , " but this sobriquet is misleading to the degree it suggests the image of a fiery ideologue astride the barricades , dashing off lines of verse to whip up the passions of young people seeking to justify their existences by attaching themselves to a cause . Under the pen name Beiiat LeCagot , Etcheberria wrote simple poems , folk tales , and wry accounts of Basque village life that reveal the % , ays of a people whose naive institutions and ancient values are rapidly being dissolved by the corrosive effects of Spanish repression and French cultural seduction . It is true that he fought against the Falange forces during the revolution ; but , as he has said , who did not ? He could never view himself as a revolutionary ; the last thing in the world he wanted was change ; and in his later years . he resented having his work and person used as a banner around which mindless terrorists might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore most complex language of Europe , his talcs and poems received little critical attention outside centers of Basque study . It is not possible to translate his poems or his proselpoetie folk tales , as they rely heavily for effect upon the particular and subtle qualities of the Basque language , with its doubled sets of verb forms , mutable word orders , conventional obliquities , and sensational onomatopoeia . But a few of his short stories were written in French , perhaps for reasons hinted at in " Minutes of a Village Meeting " ? fear that the erosion of Basque culture by the heavy social pressures of its occupying powers would condemn the young people to growing up not understanding their Eskuara heritage and language . Of the few available tales , this is my favorite , a story that takes an affectionate but sidelong view of life in a small Basco/French village in Haute Soule before the second world war . ? Trevanian Minutes of a Village Meeting URS IS A SMALL VILLAGE in Haute Soule perched on a hillside above the Gave of Uhaitz-handia , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich again . We are neither rich nor poor ; God provides enough for those who work hard and tend their flocks closely , and He protects us from the temptations of wealth by giving us land that is not excessively bountiful . Without meaning to brag , I can say that we have three festivals each year , while there are villages larger than ours that have only two , and one 1 could name ( but will not ) that has only one . I do not condemn these other villages for letting their ancient Basque traditions slip away , for I understand that the old ways are easily forgotten by those who live side by side with the outlander and come to desire his machines and radio ; but it comforts the people of my village to know that we are in the unbroken flow of ritual and joy and tragedy that has been the Basque life in these mountains since before Roland broke the mountain with his sword . ( It was we the Basque , you know , who defeated him at Roncesvalles  --  ancestors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who live closer to the outlander to be dour and old-fashioned . Our accent is imitated in bars to make jukes funnier , and occasionally people come from as far away as Paris to photograph our lera carts yoked to the horns of the russet ox of Urt and piled high with dried ferns from the hillsides . They tell us we are the last people in all of France to use wooden wheels ; and while they smile on us and say that we are charming and quaint , still they shake their heads and tell us that we must inevitably change with the changing world . Perhaps this is so . Surely things are changing , even here . We are slowly becoming a village of children and old people , as our young men and women leave to work in factoI ries in the lowlands , only coming back to visit occasionally , the young men with automobiles that have radios inside of them , and the young women wearing skirts that show their legs . Well , enough about the village . It is perhaps backwards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled out by our cumbersome old Basque style of government , village meetings in which every person may say his piece before he votes , even if he has only a little vote . Not all people have the same vote in our village ; some have heavier votes and some lighter ; it depends upon what you have inherited and how well you have done with it . We are told that in the lowlands all people are equal under the law . This seems to us to be very foolish , for any man with eyes can see that things and men are not equal , and the role of law is to assure equality amongst equals , and to make it possible for someone to become more equal if he works hard . Perhaps our way of seeing things is flawed , but we like it . After all , as the old dicton has it : chori bakhoitzari eder here ohantzea. * And old sayings are wise sayings , as the old saying says . We do not exactly make laws at our village meetings ; what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the minutes . And these minutes are sometimes very complicated , because we take every possible consideration into account and leave no loopholes that might tempt men to do things for which the village would have to ostracize them . Os-* " Each bird finds its own nest beautiful " ( trans. ) . tracism is a great penalty here , for it extends past the man to the wife , whose gossip will not be listened to at the place where clothes are washed , and such a wife will make a subtle hell of the life of the offending man . The wife becomes the stick for heating the man . Ancient Basque understanding does not allow the ostracism to extend to the children , for that would be unfair . Wives select their husbands , but children do not choose their parents . What I wanted to write about was the minutes of a village meeting we held a few years ago , just before the war came and took seven of our young men into the army , two of whom went to God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange in his head . I wanted to show you how careful and clever is our thinking out of things  --  not from pride , which is a sin , but to make a record of ourselves , because I am beginning to believe that the old way of things is passing , and without a record the great-grandchildren of our village will be lost in the world of the outlander , where , as you know , all people are exactly alike . But you could not understand the minutes of the meeting unless you knew something about the Widow Jaureguiberry , now gone to God , but at that time still amongst us . So I will tell you about the Widow Jaureguiberry . Each day the Widow Jaureguiberry would drive her small troupeau of sheep from our village to Etchebar , the next village down . And each evening she would drive them back . Now , it is required by tradition that a shepherd lead his flock so that the beasts will not stray into other people 's pastures . He is not permitted to follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , unless night or bad weather has caught him out , and a little foraging is necessary for the good of the flock . This exception is not easily abused , for everyone knows if the bad weather could have been anticipated by looking for the signs in the sky . The Widow Jaureguiberry always followed her flock , and her sheep were forever straying into the pastures of others and eating of the grass , while the Widow shouted and limped after them , seeming confused and at her wit 's end , scattering the sheep from one pasture to the next . And she would visit each farm in turn to mutter her prolonged apologies to the owner of the field , complaining how hard it was to have one 's house in our village but one 's land down in Etchebar , and to have to drive the sheep hack and forth each day . Arid all the while the old woman was explaining this , her sheep were eating your grass ! Of course , God makes fools only in Beam , and everybody in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no fields of her own , neither in our commune nor down in Etchebar . Before his death , old Jaureguiberry had not been a good peasant , and he had lost his land and gone to God leaving his wife nothing but the goodwill of Utuburru , the wine merchant . She sustained herself by allowing her few sheep to feed on the grass of others . But she was fair about it ; she distributed her sheep evenly , allowing them to stray longer into the pastures of the richer peasants , and controlling them so that they bypassed the land of the poor ( proving that , in reality , she was as good a shepherd as you or I ) . You see , the Widow Jaureguiberry was a proud Basque woman who could not humble herself to request public assistance . To do so would be to admit that her husband had not been a good provider  --  which , of course , he had not been , but that was her own business . Also there was the matter of shaming her dead father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found a way to live off the commune without appearing to do so . We all knew what she was doing , and everyone was a little proud of her Basque ingenuity . Everyone , that is , except the Colonel , who had been in the army . as many colonels have , and who was the richest man in our village and therefore the stingiest ? for God punishes the stingy by exposing them to the temptations of wealth , as the priest has assured us . All right then , that is all you have to know about the Widow to understand the minutes of our village meeting . LL THE MEN MET in the house of Utuburru the wine merchant , who opened his home to our village meetings be- cause wine is drunk at these affairs , to strengthen the blood and free the tongue . The problem before us was this : it was necessary to put a new roof on the ecole maternelle , for the rain leaked through , and the teacher who came up from the valley three days each week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repaired . Of course , the men of the village would do the work themselves . We would make a f  --  te of it and have a good time . But the tiles must be bought with money , so we decided to levy a small tax on ourselves for the purpose . It would he so many francs per hectare of land owned . Fine . It would not cost too much , and we could never have lived down the shame of being the only village in the mountains without an ecole maternelle , particularly as we had recently been forced to close up our church and accept the walk down to Etchebar each Sunday , for the priest had told us he could no longer come up and say an additional mass every week for fewer than fifty people . It had been a sad day when two of the younger men scaled the tower to take the hands off the clock that would no longer be running . But this was necessary . We could not allow God 's clock to give the wrong time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase the tiles by levying a small tax on our land was easily arrived at -- perhaps three glasses around . Of course there were complaints from the Colonel , who was rich and stingy and who had no children of his own in school , as he was far past doing it . And there was some grumbling about the Ibar family , which had very little land to tax , but which nevertheless gave a baby to the village each year and always had children in school . But such little problems are to be expected . After all , as the saying has it : Nothing is completely fair but the Last Judgment  --  so much the worse for us . It seemed that this would he a fairly easy matter , and we thought we could draw up the ruling minutes in a few hours of close thinking and arguing . Then someone thought of the Widow Jaureguiberry ! " But wait ! The Widow will either have to pay her share , or she will have to admit publicly that she has no land of her own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too poor to pay ! She lives on cheese and prayer ! " " Bof ! " said the Colonel . " What shame will there be ? She knows that we know that she has no land ! " The Colonel was bitter about Widow Jaureguiberry because she always allowed her sheep to linger longest on his land , as he was the richest of us all . " Of course she knows that we know . That is not the point ! The point is that no one has ever said it aloud ! Shame comes with the saying of it aloud , as any fool would know , if he were not a stingy man who used to be in the army  --  no offense to anyone here intended . " " Ah , ah , ah , " said one old man . " This is a puzzle that will have to be discussed over a fittle glass . " And so , for the next many hours , there was ; harp discussion and narrow reasoning chez Utuburru , and the oldest of us who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ead of his stubby pencil with his tongue as he abored at his smudged sheet , his body hunched wer the table , his face not twenty centimeters rom the paper , scratching out and rephrasing , , rratching out and rephrasing , while the rest if us took turns speaking out our minds and ) ffering new wording . And this is how the minutes finally read : to the University at Pau next year and who " After all , as needs every centime he can save for that purpose  --  but not excepting him if it turns out that he is not received at the University ) and also excepting any person who is generally known to be an " innocent " because he was struck in the head by a pelote while playing rebot , representing the village against Maul  --  on in 1927 when we won second place amongst all the Basque villages  --  but each and every other farm will contribute one hundred twenty-three francs per hectare ( or part thereof . And the number of hectares owned by a person will not be based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his estimate of his land the last time he tried to borrow against it , or upon how much land he told the potential father-in-law he had , when he was trying to marry off his daughter . ( It is understood that the Elieabe family does not agree with this last phrase because they consider it to be a slander and will fight anyone who intended it to be so , particularly Bernard Iroulugy , who proposed the phrasing in the first place . ) However , if any person happens to own fields in some other village ( such as Etchebar , for instance ) , then that person ( or these people , whoever they should be ) will not have to pay the general levy , because this council can not find a way to make them ( or her ) pay without seeming to ask Etchebar to contribute to an ? cole maternelle that is not theirs . And anyway , such persons probably do not have any children in the school because of his or her age . But if the Colonel decides to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share , then this exception does not apply to him . Signed by the Undersigned ?

We 'll get to education in a moment , but first , probably because it 's briefer , let me ask you about the nuclear carrier . A lot of Congressmen want to know whether you . Admiral Rickover , think we really need it . Some of them watch this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really need it ? Should we have it ? ADM .

Admiral Rickover will be questioned by CBS News correspondent Ike Pappas. by Haynes Johnson . columnist for the Washington Post , and by CBS News correspondent George Herman .
