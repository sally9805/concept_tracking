The Presidency <P> The second most powerful person in the United States is Rosalynn Carter . <P> There is virtually no dispute about that now among Cabinet officers , White House aides and assorted other observers of the presidential scene . The title is unofficial , and has been slow in taking effect because of the unstructured nature of Carter 's leadership . But Rosalynn now joins a select fraternity that since the end of World War II includes only Clark Clifford , John Foster Dulles , Robert Kennedy , Dean Rusk and Henry Kissinger . <P> She is the first woman in the club . She emerges from the shadows of the past two years as the President 's most trusted , wise , durable and important adviser in virtually every phase of his stewardship . " She is the first First Lady I have known who is a true adviser to the President on almost every issue , " says a White House veteran who has known them all back to Eleanor Roosevelt . Adds a former White House man : " She has more impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation . She knows what is going on . She has the best mind for statecraft and politics that we have seen among the First Ladies . " <P> It is reckoned by one White House staffer that Rosalynn counseled with the President more than any other single person during his Middle East shuttle diplomacy , not on details but on pace and tactics . Just last week , when Carter told Bob Strauss that he wanted him as his coordinator of Middle East policy , he silenced Strauss 's protest by ex plaining that he had confirmed his judgment with " Rosalynn , Cy , Zbig and Ham . " Note the order . <P> The President 's Camp David weekends are devoted to resting , reading , exercise and long , long talks with Ro salynn . She is the first of the presidential wives to keep regular , working office hours , and the " lunch with Rosalynn Carter " that shows up on the President 's schedule between Prime Ministers and Senators on Wednesday or Thurs day at 12:30 is a unique institution of the modern presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nibble at salads and sin wildly when they plunge into a dollop of flan with ice cream . They ponder things like advice about Son Jack 's grain-elevator business and the guest lists for approaching state dinners ; then Rosalynn inevitably asks for the latest information on SALT or the Middle East . At one lunch , Rosalynn got the surprise of her life when the President revealed that just minutes earlier , agreement had been reached with China for normalization of relations , a secret she kept until the announcement the next day . A Rosalynn lunch with Jimmy helped restore tentative cuts in the budget for the elderly . She plugs for health care and limitations on hospital costs . " The President of the United States cares what I think , " she said demurely last week . <P> She sits in on Cabinet meetings , has dropped round to hear national security discussions . " She is more of a realist than the President , " says one aide .                  @ @ @
