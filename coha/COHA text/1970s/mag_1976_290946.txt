Following his doctor 's orders , Jerry Ford took it easy last week . At his hideaway in the Rocky Mountain resort of Vail , Colo. , the President golfed , swam and partied with friends . As the days slipped by , Ford looked tanned , rested and confident-and with some reason . <P> Already buoyed by his hard-fought triumph over Ronald Reagan , the President got some good news from the first polls taken after the Republican Convention in Kansas City . Gallup showed Ford trailing Jimmy Carter by only 39% to 49% ; in July , after the Democratic revival meeting in Manhattan , Gallup had Ford behind by a dismal 29% to 62% . Opinion Research Corp . put Carter nine points up . TIME 'S own poll gave Carter only a six-point edge . <P> Suddenly , what had not long ago seemed to be a Carter runaway was beginning to shape up as a close race indeed . Victory will probably go to the candidate who appeals most successfully to the aspirations and fears of the vast American middle class , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on bettering its lot . <P> New Life-Style . Sociologists and demographers can debate forever just where the boundaries of this huge middle class fall . Some experts feel that fully 75% of all Americans are now middle-or upper-class . With its growing affluence , the American middle class practices a life-style that not so long ago was the preserve of the wealthy : skiing , boating , vacations abroad , tennis-and even divorce . <P> It is a hard fact of political life in the U.S. that the poor and disadvantaged fail to show their strength at the polls . Political Analyst Richard Scammon , coauthor ( with Ben Wattenberg ) of The Real Majority , estimates that as many as 80% of the 80 million to 90 million Americans who will vote in this election could be middle-or upper-class . What is more , a Gallup poll released last May showed that 47% of those surveyed consider themselves to be right of center , whatever their party label . <P> The existence of such a large , well-heeled and relatively conservative-minded body of Americans presents Ford with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : being the nominee of a party that claims the formal allegiance of only 18% to 22% of the voters . Ford 's opportunity is Carter 's danger . If the Georgian moves-or is driven by Ford-too far to the left , he risks alienating large sections of the middle class . And , by background and instinct , Carter is a populist .
