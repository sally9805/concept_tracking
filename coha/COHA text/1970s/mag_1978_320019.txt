The Met may be mighty , but the New York City Opera has Beverly Sills . In 1966 she became a top star overnight , singing the coloratura role of Cleopatra in Handel 's Julius Caesar . She repaid City Opera by becoming the bestselling box-office draw in its 34-year history . Last January , when Sills , 49 , announced that she would end her singing career in 1980 , she promised that she would stay on at City Opera-as co-director with Julius Rudel , 57 , her mentor and director of the company for 21 years . Last week " Good Queen Bev , " as Rudel has called her since her smashing performances in Donizetti 's royal trilogy ( Roberto Devereux , Maria Stuarda , Anna Bolena ) , took on the biggest and riskiest role of her career . Next July she will become the company 's sole director : Rudel has decided to devote all his energies to conducting . <P> The transition may be bumpy at first.Sills , a charmingly mettlesome Norina in the Met 's effervescent new production of Don Pasquale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cut back . But some promises may be impossible to break , such as the San Diego Opera premiere next June of a new opera written for her by Gian Carlo Menotti . Sills has little administrative experience , but she has a sharp , well-organized mind . During the past seven months , she has spent every free moment trailing the City Opera managing director . Says she : " I have learned everything : how subscriptions work , how to read cash-flow statements , what makes the company tick . My head is so full of plans and ideas that I ca n't wait to get cracking . " <P> The speed of the transition surprised the musical world and started speculation that Rudel had quarreled with City Opera 's board of directors . The company has had some sour notes in recent years . A deep financial crisis-now successfully surmounted-threatened at one point to close the house . Performances have often been slipshod lately , the casting haphazard . Rudel , although tireless , has been away from the house more and more on conducting engagements ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next fall . <P> Along with City Opera 's problems , however , Sills will inherit a healthy , adventurous tradition . Under Rudel , the company staged early operas like Monteverdi 's The Coronation of Poppea and such rarities as Janacek 's The Mahropou-los Affair and Rimsky-Korsakov 's Le Coq d ' Or . It has nurtured young singers , mostly American-including , on their way up . Sills , Sherrill Milnes , Donald Gramm and Placido Domingo . " Rudel did interesting operas and developed interesting singers , " says Anthony Bliss , executive director of the Met . " It is no mean achievement . " <P> Sills plans to keep the company mostly American and to scout Europe for expatriate talent . Says she : " If I had the career I did , educated and working in America , why ca n't others ? " She also hopes to continue producing works that are seldom staged . " I want to get to the point where , with the exception of a few bread-and-butter operas like Butterfly and Boheme , we have no crisscrossing of repertory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't be the second company in New York ; we should be the other company , the different one .
