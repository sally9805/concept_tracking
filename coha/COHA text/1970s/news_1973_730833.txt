txt For this city , one of the hardest hit by unemployment in the nation 18 Months ago , economic , clouds have riven way to some sunshine . Unemployment has gone down from 13.3 to 7.4 percent . The area 's biggest company , Boeing , has recovered somewhat from losing the SST contract and has put on almost 10,000 employees over the past year . ' But the lines of people waiting for handouts of free food in the city and suburbs are just as long as ever , because semiskilled and unskilled jobs are harder to find today . " The big change , " says Dr. Belinda PearSon , an economist for the Seattle First National Bank , " has been the Boeing employment turnaround . It has contributed greatly to stabilizing - the secondary manufacturing sector of the economy and seemed to mean that psychologically the recession is over . Influencing factors In addition , Seattle 's employment rebOund has been influenced by several other factors . For imports and exports flowing in and out of , the area 's big and beautiful Puget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest-products industry is humming because of increased housing starts nationally . But on a sour note , and somewhat reflected in the lower unemployment rate , is the decline in the area 's population . Between 1970 and 1972 it dropped by 13,000 . Many of the departures were skilled aerospace engineers , usually younger men with . small families who knew that if and when Boeing rallied becatise of product diversification , senior engineers would be the first to be rehired. *Please turn to'Page 6 *Seattle. bouncing back // Such was the experience of Donald A. Miller , an industrial engineer at Boeing for 14 years who was laid off in April of 1970 . For almost two years he was out of work . At one point , just before he was rehired by Boeing about a year ago , hp was considering a job in Alaska . Smaller salary " I get an appreciably smaller salary now , " he said , " But I 've learned how to survive and could do it again if I had to . " He notices less esprit de corps at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those who never left . " The rehired seem to be more reflective , " he said . According to Peter Bush , a Boeinz spokesman , the company has made gradual recovery mainly by marketing an improved version of the 727 airplane . " It 's selling like hot cakes , " said Mr. Bush . " We stretched its length about four years ago and made improvements in the range . " - In addition , Boeing is no longer working on " one mamoth program " at a time . " Now we have 12 smaller programs at once with programs fading in and out , " said Mr. Bush . From a high employment level of 101,000 four years ago , Boeing " bottomed out " at 37 ? , 500 employees . Today Boeing employs nearly 50,000 and is adding to the total each month . While economists see an upswing in Seattle 's economy , Mrs. Peggy Maze sees a paradox . Beginning in late 1970 at the height of unemployment rate and because of the crucial need for food , Mrs. Maze and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of " food banks " in the city .. Nearly three years later , ans despite the generally improved economy of the area , there are an astonishing 74 food banks in the state . Such a great need was being met that the Office of Economic Opportunity , at Senator Warren G. Magnuson 's prodding , has financed the program over the last two years with $1.4 million in grants . " It Is not the middle-class unemployed coming into the food banks now , " said Mrs. Maze . " It is the semiskilled and unskilled who have been pushed further down the ladder of jobs when middle-class workers began getting their jobs . " Issue taken Mrs. Maze takes issue with the 7.2 , percent unemployment rate in the Seattle area . - " The rate is arrived at mainly by the number on unemployment-insurance benefits and those looking for jobs who have registered , " she said . " So when the insurance benefits run out and the person still has n't found ? a job , the percent can only go down . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaps " of eligibility because of various reasons and can not receive unemployment payments . " In a sense , " she said , " the food-bank program has become institutionalized . We feed the people the federal government and the state government do not want to touch . And I believe we are only scratching the surface . " A three-month survey was taken at the Kings County food banks to determine the size of families being served . " We discovered that the average size was 3.2 persons , " said Mrs. Maze . " Our conclusion is that if people were being dishonest with us and asking for more food than they need they would have said there was six or seven in the family . " In the last four months , she said , the cost of food has risen 5 percent in the Seattle area . " we ' had a nutritional aid at one-of the food banks , " she said , " to show the women how to get the most out of their foods .
