To open with a digression : McGovern is fighting a battle so steeply uphill that it must , at times , seem hopeless . . . he has failed to pro  --  duce any of the results that normally signal the emer  --  gence of a major national candidate . He has attracted none of the traditional power blocs in the Democratic Party . He has precious little labor support . . . He has no machine support . . . . Worst of all , he does not appear to have mobilizO the people who should constitute his natural following : the liberal Democrats , the poor , the blacks , the young and the body of activists who supported Eugene Mc ? Carthy and Robert Kennedy in 1968 . He is running well back in the polls among the Democratic contenders and even Las Vegas oddsmaker Jimmy " the Greek " Snyder figures McGovern a 21-1 shot for the Democratic nomination , lowest on the list except for New York Mayor John Lindsay . The reasons why McGovern has failed to become a leading  --  let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Nixon has robbed him of his prime issue , ending the war in Vietnam . . . most Americans do n't think of the war as an issue any more . Furthermore , though he is very bright McGovern lacks that star quality called charisma .. . he fails to come across where any modern candidate must  --  on television . " He says the right things and he has a nice face , " says one McGovern aide . But , he adds wistfully , " if only the lucky phrase would come to put him on the front pages with a sharp accent . . . . " Excuses aside , however , the fact remains that George McGovern hardly seems to have a really good shot at the Democratic nomination . There , in a typical nationally syndicated news dis  --  patch  --  or " news analysis " ? of December 1971 , less than a year ago , is a characteristic assessment of McGovern and his liabilities  --  the candidate who has n't fired up the young , the protest candidate when protest is ever so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also-ran . No labor support , no machine support , no ray of hope from either George Gallup or Jimmy " the Greek . " As if this compendium of liabilities were n't depressing enough , the poor bastard has n't even got charisma . Seven months later , George McGovern , the Senator from South Dakota , was nominated the Democratic can  --  didate for President of the United States . ( And on the first ballot . ) Still , this man who may very well be our next President is one of the least known men in public life . It might almost be said that so much has been written about McGovern that we do not know who he is . To a devoted reader of the nation 's press , George McGovern would appear to have undergone more changes of personality in nine months than the most dedicated habitu ? of encounter groups . In short order , McGovern the Nice Guy , uncharismatic loser , Protest Candidate , became nationally recognized as the " stalking horse " for Teddy Kennedy . McGovern and his aides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early days denying that he was really Teddy Kennedy in disguise . Then , fresh from a victory in Wisconsin , the idealistic loser was meta  --  morphosed before our eyes into something called , col  --  lectively , " The McGovern Machine " ? a computerized cadre of brilliant young organizers riding triumphantly through the political thickets and trouncing at the polls such naive political newcomers as Edmund Muskie , Hubert Humphrey and John Lindsay . This change can be timed rather precisely . The Loser became the Machine when he ( or it ) started winning elections . , The Machine reared its head next as an honest-to-God Prairie Populist ? and , after a few more electoral victories , an Extremist , a radical in sheep 's clothing , a spoiler  --  indeed , a " Goldwater of the Left . " He would , said the political analysts , have to " prove himself " ( and a cynic might well ask , " To whom ? , " since all this time he was amassing a healthy winning record at the polls , the tra  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Soon enough , however , the **26;2224;TOOLONG ? **30;2252;TOOLONG became " front-running Sen. George McGovern , " and with it came a whole new set of personality traits . For now the nice guy with the right ideas of December became the " waffler " of June . No one knew what a " waffler " really was , but never  --  theless it was clear to everyone that McGovern was one . And , coincidentally , all the political analysts who were convinced before the first primary that McGovern had n't a prayer of being nominated were now knocking on the doors of smoke-filled rooms across the nation , searching for any scent they might find of a " Stop McGovern Move  --  ment . " The press was largely ' responsible for ballooning anti-McGoverft sentiment within the Democratic Party into a Stop McGovern Movement with capital letters . But McGovern was not to be stopped , and as that became increasingly apparent , the image shifted to " Mc ? Govern the Inexorable . " He moved into Miami Beach , as the San Francisco Chronicle described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an evangelistic light of reform in his eyes . " In its post-convention issue , Time picked up the image , describing McGovern as a man with a " Messianic drive . . . In Miami Beach , it was like St. John the Baptist on Collins Avenue . " From stalking horse to the Apocalypse in less than 100 days . The convention brought the McGovern story full cir  --  cle . The first-ballot victor became once again the pre  --  destined loser  --  this time against Nixon . All those news  --  men who had seen- their prophecies shattered in the pri  --  maries went double-or-nothing for the general election , describing McGovern ( ad nauseam ) as a weak candidate with enough Achilles heels to propel a centipede  --  he lacked labor support ( read Meany ) , old-time Democratic support ( read Daley ) , financial aid ( wealthy Wall Street  --  ers ) , and once again , popular support ( read Gallup ) . That , broadly , is an accurate portrait of the many McGoverns we have been treated to in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many faces is how widespread the myths became . It is as if some flipped-out media freak periodically threw a rumor into , the puddle of public domain and watched the rip  --  ples spread through all the news channels of America . Take for example , the journalistic gymnastics that oc  --  curred with the myth of " The Prairie Populist . " In Time , Life , Newsweek , the major dailies and on the networks , the public was treated to " in-depth analyses " ranging from the sexual interpretation of the Populist psyche to whether or not the movement in Georgia under Tom Watson was more Populist than the Grange move  --  ment in Wisconsin or Nebraska under La Follette or Norris . The New York Times Magazine commissioned an eminent historian to trace the development of various Populist trends in American history , supposedly to pro  --  vide the philosophical basis for McGovern 's political stances . Perhaps the most compelling image was that of organ  --  ization  --  what came to be known as the McGovern Ma  --  chine . This alliterative clich ? became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one could be excused for thinking that McGovern never won a primary  --  they were all won by the " McGovern Machine . " That machine was  --  depending on whom you read  --  a phalanx of teeny hop  --  pers large enough to people a PTA 's collective nightmare ; a computerized army of cold-blooded young technicians ; a tight circle of crafty pros directing a movement of naive youngsters ; a cadre of New Leftist " theoreticians " ; or a religious crusade  --  the radicals ' answer to Billy Graham . In trying to find a handy explanation for the primary victories they could n't understand and had n't predicted , the political analysts grasped at the " Machine " myth . Looking more closely at McGovern in the early flush of each primary victory , reporters would see first the state apparatus  --  the " out-front " part of the campaign that was most readily visible  --  mistake it for the candidate him  --  self , and launch into long " explainers " about why Mc Govern " really won " this state , resulting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco Chronicle : " Fueled on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches , the youthful volunteers were out in force last week as the pre-primary campaigning sputtered towards its penultimate week in New Hampshire . " Joseph Alsop : " Wisconsin and Massachusetts did not in fact prove that McGovern had suddenly developed an irresistible attraction for the American voter . They proved the worth of good organization in primaries . " Newsweek : The McGovern campaigns in New York and California " will involve mobilizing a force so vast that the McGovern campaign may take its place among the major land armies . " Time : " Here was plain , slow-spoken George McGovern , minister 's son , prairie populist , leading the armies of commitment and ideological chic . However ruggedly colorless the driver , his bandwagon rolled flamboyantly on , bright with the fresh-faced young and movie stars and intellectuals who had found their new political vehicle . " Where all these accounts broke down was in their failure to note that brilliant organizers and " peanut butter and jelly " power are for naught without basic electoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so broad-based demonstrates that McGovern had the sup  --  port to begin with . One of Muskie and Humphrey 's prob  --  lems in state after state was that , though they had long lists of endorsements from politicians , they did n't have enough dedicated supporters to finance or staff massive campaign organizations . McGovern had broad support ; Humphrey , Lindsay and Muskie did n't . Going one step further , it could be argued that McGovern 's organization was not indeed all that power ful . He had numbers of volunteers and a few novel campaign strategies , but the basic thrust of the campaign was as traditional as peanut butter and jelly . Nor were all those Wunderkinder as brilliant as the McGovern detractors would have us believe . Like any other cam  --  paign organization the McGovern camp had its share of superstars with stout egos , some deadwood and a steadily increasing number of opportunists who wanted to latch onto a winner . McGovern did have broad grass-roots ' support ( and grass-roots money ) ; he did have several devices for getting his volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important organizational strategy that was mostly overlooked by the press  --  let the locals do their own thing . The Washington staff was the smallest possible for a national campaign . Indeed , the primary campaign 's biggest asset was its very absence of organization . That was what allowed McGovern to get closer to the voters , while other can  --  didates sidled closer to the powerless " power brokers . " McGovern had a couple of good strategists at the top  --  not excluding George McGovern  --  and a mass of enthusi  --  astic , innovative and tireless volunteers at the bottom , with very little managerial organization in between . What looked like a machine to the press was little more than a national " happening . " After the convention , some of the flaws inherent in the " brilliant " primary organization began to surface . Lacking people at the " middle-management " level , it had difficulty functioning as a cohesive multilevel operation . Essentially it was a campaign with a one-track mind  --  at the very top . Like McGovern himself to some degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one issue at a time As McGovern had attacked the war or hunger or farm issues in the course of his Senatorial career  --  but rarely several issues at the same time  --  so his Presidential cam  --  paign suffered from single-mindedness . The staff that had functioned so smoothly when it contested one primary state at a time  --  concentrating all its resources on . that stateseemed to come Unraveled when confronted with an unexpected challenge to the California delegation in the Credentials Committee . So the single-minded cam  --  paign staff devoted all its time to overcoming the Cali  --  fornia challenge , thereby scanting the most important decision of all  --  the choice of a Vice Presidential candi  --  date . That decision  --  made in about twelve hours  --  ulti  --  mately cost the campaign several precious weeks ( not to mention momentum , an aura of candor and desperately needed cash ) that should have been spent developing detailed and critical campaign plans . So the organizational myth tells less about the power of McGovern 's organization than about the power of the media priests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's victories without explaining McGovern himself , or the " new electorate " that kept working and voting for him . There are many possible explanations for this jour  --  nalistic obfuscation , not the least of which is the ties most journalists ' have with their news sources . There is in this country a political elite that extends far beyond " official " Washington . It includes lobbyists , fat cats , corporateexecutives , politicians and big-name journalists . All have common lines of communication and interrelated needs . The power of a reporter or columnist is dependent , to a large extent , on his contacts with those who actually hold power . And he is tied emotionally and professionally to those with whom he can most easily communicate . One can imagine James Reston dining with Hubert Humphrey at the latter 's summer home in Waverly , Minn. , and emerging with a week 's worth of " insider " column ma  --  terial . It is more difficult to imagine Reston  --  or for that matter Eric Sevareid , Evans and Novak , Joe Alsop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their own turf with members of a black caucus , a women 's caucus , a Chicano caucus , or indeed with any of the " new power brokers " of the recent Democratic conven  --  tion . They are outside the personal and informational orbits of these men . The ties between newsman and news makec are effec  --  tive information channels when the political alignments of a country maintain an even keel ; but at times of political upheaval , of dramatic voter shifts and " new coalitions , " the elite reporters and columnists will throw in their lot naturally with the old coalitions  --  the sources of their information and the sources of their power . Their wisdom will be conventional wisdom ; their insights will be dated ; their biases will rise to the surface in even the most dispassionate of news commentaries . Other reportorial errors can be traced directly to can  --  didates who try to sell a particular image of an opponent to the press and the public  --  the ' planted leak . " Often the image takes on a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit and need to that candidate 's camp . Sen. Henry Jackson was one of the first to worry in public about McGovern 's " difficulties on amnesty , pot and abortion . " Soon the idea gained such wide currency that it managed to outlive the political fortunes of its major proponent . Newsweek : " Perhaps more important , many Demo  --  cratic veterans wonder what will happen to McGovern 's blossoming blue-collar appeal when Humphrey and Wal  --  lace begin drawing attention to his stands in favor of bussing , legalized abortion and eased penalties for mari  --  juana use . " The Los Angeles Times : " The toothache stems from McGovern 's positions on a group of ticklish issues , includ  --  ing abortion , amnesty , bussing , tax reform , and his per  --  sonal attitude toward business . " Time : " Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott was moved to call McGovern the triple-A candidate  --  acid , amnesty and abortion . ' " Everyone , it seemed , knew of McGovem 's " difficulties on amnesty , pot and abortion " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions on those questions . A related kind of conventional wisdom deriving from conventional sources made Edmund Muskie the " Demo  --  cratic front runner , " and McGovern the one-issue " also-ran , " more than a year before any citizen had a chance to vote on the question . Muskie was the front runner because the press made him the front runner , and so much for the wisdom of the press . McGovern 's base of support , one that had grown sub stantially in the Vietnamese War years , was not to be measured by familiar means . His base was outside the traditional political power structure ; much of his money came in dollar bills through the mail , not from the Wall Street kingmakers ; his workers came from homes and col  --  leges and factories , not from machine politicians ' master lists ; his support derived from the blue-collar worker , not the " labor leaders , " from the black man and woman , not the " civil rights leaders " ; his ideology grew out of voter frustrations and home-grown dissent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The few politicians who looked ahead for clues to the future saw the promise of a McGovern candidacy ; those who looked back were wrong . So the press spun its myths while McGovern got his votes . Some hints of truth lurked within every myth , but the real McGovern continued to elude the merchants of information . Now that the dust has settled a bit , it seems well past time to find out a little more about the Demo  --  cratic nominee for President . It is common practice for Congressmen and Sen  --  ators to send Christmas cards to staff members , friends , contributors and other assorted and important constitu ? ents . Usually the inside carries a simple Peace on Earth message , and the cover displays a smiling family photo , a water color of a familiar landmark back home , or a picture of the Capitol . Back in 1962 , having just been elected Senator by the whopping majority of 597 votes , McGovern sent out a Yuletide greeting with a picture of the White House on the cover . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Presi  --  dency early in his career . In fact , McGovern once told a reporter that , on Election Day , 1956 , as he watched the returns mount in his first political race , he dreamed of running for the Presidency . The meteoric rise which culminated in the " impossible dream " of 1972 becomes much less a puzzle when one analyzes the early political career of George McGovern . Anyone who took the time to trace his political ascension would have realized that he was not simply Mr. Nice Guy , the White Knight or Saint George . He is and always has been a tough , effective , skillful and ambitious poli  --  tician , whose outstanding characteristic is dogged persist  --  ence . The key to McGovern 's success in 1972 is rooted in his experiences as executive secretary of South Dakota 's Democratic Party in the mid-fifties . What he did in South Dakota during those lonely and backbreaking years he has now repeated in the most recent four years  --  only this time his vehicle is the National Democratic Party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that he probably had a tougher job cut out for him in 1952 , for the state party then was in worse shape even than the Na  --  tional Democratic Party after the 1968 Presidential campaign , The WASPish residents of Sioux Falls , Rapid City and Aberdeen who dominate South Dakota politics are very often owners of small businesses , salesmen and bankers ? the backbone of the Republican Party . But there are also Germans and Swedes who came to farm the land  --  and who remain less prosperous than the city folk ; they brought with them the prairie radicalism of Wisconsin , Nebraska and Minnesota . It was on the latter constitu  --  ency that McGovern knew he had to build his base . From 1936 on , the years had been lean for South Da  --  kota Democrats . And , in particular , 1952 was a disas  --  trous year . The Democrats wound up with only two seats in the Statehouse and none in the State Senate . For the next three years George McGovern crisscrossed the state in his jalopy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in breathing life into the party was to organize precinct committeemen and to get candidates for all the offices on the state ballot in 1954 . McGovern went to every cake sale , Sunday school picnic and civic function he could possible get to . ( Years later , one of his aides remarked that George McGovern had probably shaken the hand of every South Dakotan at least once . ) By 1956 he had built enough of an organization and personal following to challenge and defeat an incumbent , Harold Lovre , who had represented the First Congres- sional District for four terms . McGovern thus became the first Democrat elected to national office in South Dakota since early New Deal days ( 1934 ) . In 1958 the Demo  --  crats elected twenty-one of their candidates to the thirty  --  five-member State Senate and thirty-two to the South Dakota House . At the same time McGovern was re-elected in a tough fight against the popular , outgoing Governor , Joe Foss . Almost single-handedly , McGovern had built an organization that eventually enabled the Democrats to win the Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is difficult to determine just when McGovern made a conscious decision to seek the Presidency . As his deputy campaign manager and former administrative as  --  sistant , George Cunningham , tells it : " The Presidential bug was an accumulative bug , McGovern was frustrated as a seminary student . He was frustrated as a college professor  --  talking to thirty students , reaching maybe fif  --  teen . He was frustrated as a Congressman , one out of 435 . He was frustrated as administrator of Food for Peace . He is frustrated as a Senator . It is a bug born of frustration and an inability to achieve what he feels needs to be ' done in this country . " McGovern had given considerable thought to running for the Presidency in mid-1967 . After much soul-search  --  ing and a realistic appraisal of his own re-election prob  --  lems in South Dakota , he suggested to self-styled " Presi  --  dent-dumper " Allard Lowenstein that maybe he 'd better find someone else to take on Lyndon Johnson  --  someonelike Eugene McCarthy . That decision was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 1968 unfolded its bizarre and tragic surprises . The rationale and tone behind a possible McGovern candidacy were laid out in a Look article which greatly impressed McGovern . In the May 28 , 1968 issue of the magazine , senior editor , George B. Leonard , wrote : " It may even be possible for some present-day candidate to subvert one of the parties toward openness and en  --  counter . He could start simply by being himself . Even now , anyone who cuts through the sham and scheming , who is entirely honest about his actions , motives and feelings , might well electrify the voters and become a real threat to the pros . " Leonard 's analysis reinforced McGovern 's perceptions . McGovern had ripened , and it only became a question of time . The tragic assassination of Robert Kennedy , on the night of his victory in the California primary , started the wheels in motion . McGovern did not think that Mc ? Carthy was a winner . He was a confirmed " Kennedy man , " and he was under intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He cam  --  paigned actively for sixteen days and received 146.5 dele  --  gate votes in Chicago . Aware that he did n't have a prayer , McGovern got some exposure and set himself up as an alternative leader for the anti-war factions . The far-sighted responsibility for reform played a ma  --  jor role in McGovern 's journey to the nomination . The Democratic Party , and particularly its left wing , was in a shambles after the Chicago convention . Kennedy was dead , Humphrey was a loser , the party was $9 million in debt after the election , and millions of voters felt'dis  --  enfranchised . McCarthy , with his poetic metaphors and self-defeating ways , was an enigma to his followers , and the puzzlement turned into bitterness when he relin  --  quished his seat on the Foreign Relations Committee ( to a hawk ) and eventually dropped out of the Senate . McGovern took advantage of the vacuum by moving ahead on two levels . First , he accepted the appointment by the Democratic National Committee as chairman of the Commission on Party Structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead end " task seriously and ener  --  getically  --  much to the astonishment of regular Democrats who learned too late that this was not another exercise in window dressing . McGovern opened the process of convention delegate selection to the disenfranchised . By coincidence , the folks he let in were those who were shut out at Chicago and who were most likely to support him . After nearly two years of tedious deliberation , the Mc ? Govern people not only rewrote the rules , they learned them  --  something his opponents neglected to do . And many of the , McGovern commission " whiz kids " ? who did the detailed footwork for the commission  --  were later to resurface as the McGovern campaign " whiz kids . " While McGovern 's hands were gaining a firm hold on the party machinery , his legs carried him across the country , beginning in early 1969 . He had graduated from the cake sale circuit , but he spoke to anyone else who would listen . He was out to beef up what they call in the pollster trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political heavies missed . While McGovern 's position in the polls moved only from 3 to 6 per cent during 1971 , his recognition factor jumped from 42 to 72 per cent . By the time McGovern announced his candidacy on January 18 , 1971 , that cold winter afternoon in the studio of KELO-TV , Sioux Falls , S.D. ? an unprecedented twenty-two months before the general election  --  a careful strategy had been mapped out . He had by that time be  --  come the candidate of the anti-war activists and the young . In addition , most of the work of the McGovern commission had been completed . McGovern himself said in October of 1971 : " I do n't think I would have had the nerve to run for the Presidency if it were not for these reforms . " In essence , then , McGovern had painstakingly built a new house within the Democratic Party , just as he had done nearly a decade ago in South Dakota . The ground  --  work had been laid for a national campaign at the grass  --  roots level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bottom up with carefully chosen constituencies . McGovern 's father , Joseph , decades earlier , had roamed the Plains personally building churches and establishing congregations and then passing on to another town to start anew , leaving behind him a string of established Methodist congregations . So his son set about building a revived Democratic Party  --  first in South Dakota , then nationally through the party reform rules , and then in state after state the caucuses , conventions and primaries . As he hit the primary trail  --  with all the perseverance of the Rev. Joseph McGovern  --  what was McGovern 's strongest appeal ? First , he was not a convert to the anti  --  war movement . McGovern had been against the war since 1963 . He came across therefore as a man of deep con  --  viction . He was also open and honest , relatively new , the architect of party reform . And , too , he was " closer to the people " ? of necessity , since having been close to the Kennedys he had no real power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base outside the Senate cloakroom . He fit right into the crusader-cum  --  underdog pattern . In short , he symbolized what America was looking for after all the political duplicity of the Viet  --  namese War years . In explaining his appeal , McGovern 's supporters de  --  scribe him as a sort of " anti-politician . " Shirley Mac ? Laine , for example , could get away with introducing the candidate  --  to loud cheers at one rally after another in California  --  by saying , " George McGovern is not a poli  --  tician but a political humanist . " Some old-line Democrats , as well as reporters of type and tube , indignantly exclaimed that the McGovern peo  --  ple were " new faces practicing the old politics . " That may have been true , but new or old , they were organized , they were close to their constituency , and they were n't buying a Muskie , a Lindsay or a Humphrey . A week before the Wisconsin primary , Eugene McCarthy wryly remarked of the McGovern operation : " He has got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German offi  --  cers and Irish troops . " So the generals and the troops , playing by the new rule book , built a campaign from the bottom up through the primaries . McGovern coolly plied his trade and gathered his delegates and his crucial momentum  --  just as he had always done  --  while the press built its sand castles . The primary campaign went almost exactly as the Mc ? Govern strategists had mapped it  --  slowly , steadily build  --  ing a delegate majority and popular momentum in a carefully selected combination of primary states . They carefully sank all the bank shots of their choice . After all the infighting over credentials and platform at Miami Beach , it became obvious to anyone who had listened to him carefully and watched the bargaining of his floor managers that George McGovern was no radical or " Prairie Populist . " At worst he was a moderate , and at best a man who seriously wanted to win . It was a point that should have been obvious all along , were it not for the smokescreen put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention not so much because of parliamen  --  tary or managerial brilliance but ? because he had done his homework  --  the delegates had come to Miami Beach committed to McGovern and to the changes he repre  --  sented . The middle of a campaign is not the time to paint the likeness of any candidate in sharp personal focus , but the outlines of McGovern 's personality and style have begun to emerge . His speeches and press confer  --  ences tend toward the preacher-teacher style of his early manhood . He employs wit and humor sparingly and does n't seem very comfortable when he does . His imagi  --  nation at times seems as flat as the Great Plains , though his speeches often belie that impression . He combines honesty , sensitivity , and deeply felt , convictions with prag  --  matism and deftness . He seems to be in control of the tensions that exist in a man who consciously attempts to combine idealism with realism . He is , in short , a politician who has his ear to the ground , his sensitivities intact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent . One distinguishing quality about George McGovern deserves special mention . An occupational hazard of most people who enter public life is that they become enam  --  ored of their own rhetoric . Hubert Humphrey is an ' ex  --  ample , in extremis . McGovern is short-winded , direct and economical on the stump . One is struck , too , by the fact that he is a serious listener  --  another natural asset in a country that has been " oversold " on everything from antacids to Asian wars . The " consumer " is striking back in 1972 ? he wants to be heard , not told . This rising pop  --  ular impulse fits hand in glove with McGovern 's personal style and political ideology . McGovern has managed to crystallize the resentments of the voter of 1972 . He has symbolized the underdog  --  the candid voice of dissent  --  as he has reasoned and preached the inadequacies of current governmental poli  --  cies . He has symbolized , too , the inadequacies of govern  --  ment by press release . His is a campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making ? " too open " at times for his own political good  --  and moralistic directness . And he has listened . This is an ideal formula for winning a limited number of primaries , but it remains to be seen if it is also an adequate springboard from which to win a general elec  --  tion and then to govern . McGovern 's attack until now has been more effective politically than administratively . Whether he can translate the primary victories into a suc  --  cessful general election victory , raise his policies to pro grams , and transform his advisers into governmental man  --  agers are still matters for speculation . The Eagleton affair is perhaps the most striking exam  --  ple of McGovem 's administrative immaturity , and Mc ? Govern must bear the responsibility for it . As a candidate for President he can delegate work , but not responsibility . All the excuses by Gary Hart about not having enough time or people to check out Eagleton are nonsense . Mc ? Govern should , at the very least , have spent a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination is George McGovern the radical the press painted him  --  he 's not even a Popu  --  list , except insofar as he built his campaign close to the people and the issues that he encountered at a grass-roots level . He is otherwise very much the traditional liberal who believes in incremental changes , with power and control flowing from the top . A major problem for Mc ? Govern is that although he has a firm grasp of foreign policy , and a deep intuitive sense of America 's abiding frustrations , he has had little personal experience in deal  --  ing with economic and social problems , particularly as they affect urban centers and minority groups . Lacking a frame of reference , he has compounded the problem by becoming excessively dependent on academic theorists who tend to spin off their own concoctions , usually with little attention to tough practical solutions .

His domestic programs  --  most of which are still vague ? are more or less logical extensions of New Frontier-Great Society policies .

Govern has said indicates that he is conscious of this underlying issue . There is no question that the McGovern staff has many highly competent technicians , but where are Mc ? Govern 's substantive people ? It takes an exceptional hu  --  man being to be both , and until late in September there was little evidence of serious , programmatic content emerging from the McGovern mimeograph machine  --  at least with regard to issues of race and poverty . But even though McGovern has been slow to come forth with concrete solutions to pressing domestic needs , he still is in a better position than Nixon . The President , who has had four years to put his programs to work , appears to have given up altogether the search for solu  --  tions to urgent social problems . And there are a host of other issues where a McGovern administration would seem heaven-sent next to the Nixon gang . A serious anal  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biases reveal the President to be the ultimate practitioner of political expedience . Mr. Nixon 's public pronouncements on nearly every major issue  --  unernploy  --  ment , school bussing , welfare reform , tax reform , prison reform , hunger , black capitalism , the Haynsworth and Carswell nominations to the Supreme Court , the drug problem , abortion , the William Calley affair , My Lai , the plight of the POWs , Vietnamization , the bombing of the dikes , revenue sharing , the Manson trial , the India-Paki  --  stan War  --  are phrased , for maximum PR effect and are devoid of serious content . They do not even hint at a sensitive understanding of critical social problems , nor do they suggest the quality of leadership that will bring us closer to their solution . It is not by coincidence that most of Nixon 's closest personal advisers are ad agency executives and most of McGovern 's are journalists and academicians . The luckless leaders of the tin-cup brigade ( Lockheed , Penn Central , ITT , Boeing , and ever so many more ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fixed incomes , workers with frozen wages , minority groups or the 6 million children suffering from malnutrition . He wants desperately to be re-elected , and he knows which side of the bread has the butter . Big campaign money comes from the vaults of industry and Wall Street ; Demo  --  cratic money traditionally comes from the check-off dol  --  lars of wage earners . The best Nixon can offer to the vast majority of Americans is half-truths and , with the help of his ad agency-in-residence , he has elevated their utterance to an art form . McGovern , by contrast , has opposed Nixon on just about every issue listed above . He senses Nixon 's vulner  --  ability both on the issues and on the way he exploits them . The central thrust of his campaign is , " You ca n't trust Richard Nixon . " Dissatisfaction with Nixon is present just below the surface throughout the country . George Wallace exploited the discontent without a program ; Mc ? Govern will use it to his advantage with a limited pro  --  gram . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his campaign : an end to the war in Vietnam , tax reform , redirected priorities , and the resto  --  ration of trust and truthfulness in government . George McGovern manifests an almost prophetic ( and noncharismatic ) sense of the collective dignity and re  --  sources of the American people . Whether he can translate abstract attitudes into specific programs is , of course , conjectural . He succeeded in doing just that within the limited arena of the Food for Peace program . On a broader scale , though , he gives the impression that he is a man who has no intention of seeing the country or him  --  self getting clobbered for entertaining a vision . And one vital factor will serve to " keep him honest . " His constituency  --  however developed  --  consists largely of those Americans most aggrieved by the problems anddislocations of the " New America . " A President can not move too far from his natural constituency , and in order to maintain his political base , McGovern , as President , would have a mandate to attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not do so , the consequences could be truly disastrous . Similarly , Nixon , though taking short excursions away from his political home base , has been unwilling to make any dramatic departures from the interests of Corporate America . And , most assuredly , he will be under no compulsion to do so in his final term . While the press has busied itself putting George Mc ? Govern into old political bags , the man from South Da  --  kota has diligently laid the groundwork for a true " new coalition " within the ruins of the Vietnam-era Demo  --  cratic Party . Nixon and McGovern both maintain that the American people have a real choice this go-around , and they 're no doubt correct . The men are dramatically differ  --  ent in style and substance , in interest and in constituency . Both also agree that Nixon 's record is " the issue . " It could make a strong case for the challenger . q Much of the world holds the opinion that Israelis are a people whose military and political policy toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , a tooth for a tooth , " but I do n't think that the Old Testament injunction accu  --  rately reflects the Israeli response to acts of murder and intimidation against its civilian and military population . Israel has not survived for twenty-five years by wallow  --  ing in illusions . The shock of the last few weeks and months of terror has by now been contained . A war is going on ; it is a different type of war . Israel must adapt its defenses and offenses to the new warfare . Who would think that three mad Japanese would come to Israel on a Kamikaze mission , simply to shoot and kill any civilians who wandered in front of their machine guns ? Who could believe that Fatah 's Black September group  --  an arm of its intelligence wing , according to Is  --  raeli experts  --  would take hostage much of the Israeli Olympic squad and , when their demands were not met , kill the hostages while meeting their own deaths ? Other recent events include : ? A bomb placed in some luggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking off from Rome ; however , the steel reinforcement of the cargo hold limited damage and protected the passengers . ? An Israeli diplomat was called to a meeting in a bar in Belgium and sprayed , gangster-style , by automatic weapons fire . Although he received five rounds , the diplo  --  mat managed to survive . ? Numerous letter bombs were sent to Israeli embassies in Europe ; one of them exploded and killed Dr. Ami She  --  hori , an agricultural attache in London . And the story will continue . The Palestinian terrorists , defeated and cut off from their own people in the territory they call their homeland , have decided to foment a cam  --  paign of terror in countries thousands of miles away from the scene of conflict with Israel . Some review is in order to understand the reasons be  --  hind this recent surge of terrorism . Israel 's military po  --  sition on its Western front is superb . Egypt , its chief mili  --  tary antagonist , is weaker than at any point since the months following the Six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has left the main Arab mili  --  tary power with inadequate offensive weaponry and , ac  --  cording to reports , with key element 's and spare parts in their antiaircraft system dismantled by the Soviets . Furthermore , even if the missile defense system were operative , the Americans have found electronic means to evade and destroy the more advanced generation of SAM missiles in North Vietnam . ( This is not to comment on the political side or the eventual political effectiveness of the continued bombing of North Vietnam . ) And one may rest assured that the American developments have been passed on to the Israelis , and that the Egyptians ' vaunted missile defense systems can be surmounted  --  with casu  --  alties but also with relative ease . Israel thus has decisive military superiority on its Western front , and the Egyp  --  tians know it . Besides , Israel no longer faces the threat of Russian intervention against any counteroffensive un  --  dertaken in response to an Egyptian " heating-up " of the Suez Canal area . Thus Egypt , in its weakest military position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a diplomatic campaign to be undertaken this fall : There have in this
