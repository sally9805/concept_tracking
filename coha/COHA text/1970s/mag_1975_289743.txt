Almost everyone knows what it is like to have his blood pressure taken . But few really know what the doctor is doing , and fewer still comprehend the meaning of the figures that register blood pressure . Actually , taking blood pressure and interpreting the results is a simple process . <P> The device used to measure blood pressure is called a sphygmomanometer ( from the Greek , meaning pulse measurement ) ; it measures the air pressure needed to raise a column of mercury . To use it , the doctor pumps air into a cloth cuff wound tightly round the patient 's arm . As the cuff expands , the column of mercury rises in response to the increasing air pressure . That pressure also causes the cuff to press against the brachial artery , stopping the flow of blood . The doctor , his stethoscope pressed against the patient 's forearm , knows that the flow has ceased when he can no longer hear the heartbeat . At that point , he slowly releases the air from the cuff . As pressure drops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and blood begins to flow through the arm again . The doctor notes the level of the mercury column when he can once more hear the heartbeat . This reading is the systolic measurement . It is the higher of the two figures used in the measurement of blood pressure and reflects the force with which the heart is delivering blood to the body . <P> To get the diastolic , or lower reading , the doctor lets more air out of the cuff and continues to listen ; the pulse momentarily gets louder and then fades . The level at which the sound of the pulse disappears is the diastolic , or the pressure in the circulatory system when the heart is relaxing and refilling . <P> Because blood pressure tends to increase naturally with age , a reading of 110 over 60 , considered good for a young man , would be high enough to cause concern if it were recorded in a small child . A 45-year-old man with a reading of 120 over 80 ( or less ) is in good shape , but a contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . According to insurance-company figures , his life expectancy is 11 years less .
