MANY U.S. goals in Viet Nam have been scaled down or simply abandoned , but President Nixon has frequently renewed two pledges . One is that Saigon will be given " a reasonable chance " of survival . The other , an emotional issue about which the President has made it clear there can be no compromise , is that the U.S. will fight on until it can recover the 460-odd Americans now held prisoner . <P> For months , the Communists demanded that the U.S. make concessions before they would even discuss the prisoners . " It always comes back to the same thing , " Nixon said in a moment of exasperation . " If we end our involvement and set a date , they will agree to discuss prisoners-not to release them . " Then , last week , the Communists suddenly offered the captives for ransom-and thus created a major dilemma for the Administration . <P> Seven-Part Plan . The new approach came from Madame Nguyen Thi Binh , the austerely handsome ex-schoolteacher who represents the Communist Viet Cong at the long-deadlocked peace talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on the table only a week after Le Due Tho-Hanoi 's chief envoy to the talks-returned to Paris following a 14-month absence . As the key point in a seven-part plan , Madame Binh declared that if the U.S. agreed to withdraw all its forces from Viet Nam by the end of this year , the Communists would agree to return all the prisoners at a proportionate rate . " These two operations , the American withdrawal and the liberation of prisoners will begin on the same date and will end on the same date , " said Madame Binh . <P> It was not that simple , of course . In addition to U.S. withdrawal , the Communists reiterated some familiar and , to the Administration , unacceptable demands : that the U.S. cut off all aid to Viet Nam and abandon the " puppet " government in Saigon in favor of a coalition that would include the Communists . In effect , the Communists were saying : If you really want your prisoners so badly , take them , and give us South Viet Nam in exchange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They have put one seemingly good egg in the basket with all the bad ones , " said an Administration spokesman . Presidential Press Secretary Ron Ziegler noted that the proposal contained " positive as well as clearly unacceptable elements , " but he added that the U.S. would never " turn the 17 million people of Viet Nam over to the Communists . " <P> The U.S. appeared to be caught in a trap . On the military front , it is already withdrawing its forces from Viet Nam . On the political front , the U.S. Senate has voted an amendment to the draft-extension bill that is remarkably similar to the Communist proposal : a withdrawal in nine months , conditional on an agreement within 90 days for the return of prisoners . ( The measure has not been approved by the House , nor is it binding on the Administration . ) <P> The Communist offer brought some prompt expressions of interest on Capitol Hill . " These proposals mark a different point of departure , " said Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield , sponsor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott agreed : " Now we can start negotiating seriously .
