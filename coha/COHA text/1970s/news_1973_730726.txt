txt The Nixon administration today retreated on its earlier threat to withhold nearly $500 million a year in federal welfare funds from states with ineligible or overpaid recipients . The Department of Health , Education , and Welfare announced that final ' regulations to be published soon will give states a new 18-month timetable beginning next year to correct errors in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children AFDC program . As originally proposed last December , federal penalties applying to bath AFDC and adult caseload errors would have begun this year . FRANK C. Carlucci , HEW undersecretary , said the administration is not retreating on the principle that errors must be reduced , but is conceding that the original timetable " was not realistic . " Carlucci said at least one governor had stated flatly that his state 's welfare error figures would be falsified to avoid losing federal funds ' . Thirty-four states had retained the Washington law firm of Covington &; Burling and threatened to sue in an attempt to block the original proposal . UNDER THE new regulations , states will be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors . Failure to meet a target would result in a proportionate loss of federal money for that period . States also will be allowed error rates of 3 per cent for ineligibility cases and 5 per cent for overpayment cases . The original proposal would not have permitted any error tolerance . The government had estimated that the original proposal could have cost states $689 million in lost federal funds during 1973 and the first half of 1974 . ADULT WELFARE programs for the aged , blind , and . disabled are not covered in the new rule because they will be federalized Jan. 1 . The federal government now pays about 55 per cent of the nation 's welfare bills , with state and local . governments contributing the j. rest . States will be required to conduct a new welfare eligibility review between April and September to refine their socalled quality control system . Those figures will be used as a yardstick in measuring future performance to correct errors .                   @ @
