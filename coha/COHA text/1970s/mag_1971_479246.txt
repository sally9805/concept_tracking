THE LAW MANDATES that in fourteen months I there be an election for the Presidency of the United States of America . There 's no getting around it . no escaping and certainly no hiding from it if you own a television tube . The ideal solution would be to declare the office vacant for a term or two . Anarchy at the top would induce tranquillity and order at the bottom , but an election there must be , and we shall all , each and every one of us. make our tiny contribution , either by taking part or refusing to . Many of us , out of force of habit or despair , will try to pick a candidate . The difficulty is that we 've been stung so often now that we do n't know how . The inherited wisdom of the civics dassibetter government/goo-goo tradition has it that the good citizen carefully informs himself about the men and issues and then picks the most qualified person . But with the Presidency there is only one qualification : getting the job . This year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do that . The list of candidates is so long and so unstable it 's impossible to complete it . Every month there 's another one . In part this is due to the mass media 's short attention span . After a week they lose interest and , like the family dog , drop the rubber hone logo fetch the rubber mouse . In deference to the tradition of paying candidates much heed . we shall supply a little Washington-type. winter book analysis . None of this should be given any predictive value whatsoever . You might just as well study these guys by body type or weight or church affiliation . In Washington where I live and suffer , a man is adjudged episcopabalis by the quality of his Staff , If he 's got a good staff , they take him seriously even if he has 3 per cent public recognition in the Harris Poll . This is the way it is with Birch on the Hill " Whether that means they remember to keep the colored flags on the map moving so they do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whether it means something greater , is hard to say . What is known is that Bayh spends a great deal of time on the horn honking at fellow pols throughout the country and that his staff is supposed to have the best , most up-to-date lists of key contacts . givers , local leaders , and prospec ? tive delegates . It 's this bustle of professionalism that impresses the professional political Nandi. cappers in Washington . The rest of Senator Bayh is a little harder to be sure about . He has a set of very nice dimples , he unquestionably led the fight to fend off Hayns. worth and Carswell , but on the war and such he is all over the lot . Write him and ask him his position . He has a good staff so you 'll probably get a lot of material hack by return mail . An unbavhised view of the Senator 's chances suggests he has virtually none , but as a kind of WASP Sammy Glick. the hustling Hoosier Boy Scout does come through with some quotes that make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could enjoy him . Some of his best concern the divinity : " I 'm fundamentally very religious . I developed a very personal relationship with my God , I 'm no prude and I 'm no saint . I 'm in between . Maybe we need somebody who can articulate across that spectrum of thought . " Bayh also writes poetry to his wife , whose name is Marvella . The other poet in the race is. of course , Eugene McCarthy . It does n't matter if he has a good staff McCarthy glows and glows , but despite the luminescence , fewer and fewer people can put up with him or even understand him . because the man is too much of an obdurate loner to use it . The least political of all the men mentioned for the job , the former Minnesota metaphysician has been acting like the unblinking , infinite eye in the triangle on the back of the dollar bill . He glows and he glows , but despite his charm and luminescence , fewer and fewer people can put up with him or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth party and he leads it , it will not have any material effect on the election 's outcome . At this writing , McCarthy 's most telling effect on the process we are about to see unfold may be his continuing ability to keep a small group of large contributors hypnotized , thereby blocking off from McGovern the money he badly needs . Humphrey and other follies HUBERT HORATIO HUMPHREY does n't have a campaign staff yet . That may he just as well because , when he did , it was reputed to be awful . one of the worst , which , as you see , was no bar to his seizing and holding major office . Hill says he has n't made up his mind , but one does get the feeling that he 's waiting for the other guys to kill themselves off , so he can jump into the last couple of primaries and , hand in hand with George Meany and Dick Daley , swipe the nomination to the disgust of millions . Officially his position is a marvel of mixed metaphor : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . I 'm not salivating but I 'm occasionally licking my chops . " Even Hubert knows he has a problem , and so he 's jumping around in his hyperenergetic way , armed with a horrendous dark-red dye job that makes his real hair look like a wig . while he tells people things like , " I do n't think I 'm old hat . I think I 'm with it ... I am one emancipated Senator . " But if Humphrey is laughable to you . he is n't to the residual powers . organizations , lobbies , and contributors that have dominated Democratic party politics for two generations . If the people who ca n't stand him sit home pouting with their thumbs in their mouths , he will be nominated , thus causing a dreadful overload on our mental health facilities , as well as guaranteeing a fourth ? party split and Nixon 's reelection , Although by nature a moderate and humane man , Hubie 's political enthusiasms have made him an unacceptable extremist in his own party , first to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The greatest service he could perform is to get out of the race and play a supporting role , but he 's not about to do that , so what is needed is a compromise candidate ... which brims Edmund S. Muskie . Ordinarily , compromise candidates late . It is unheard of for one to he a fronts/ a couple of years before the election , but NI is n't only an intraparty compromise , he . tional compromise : the good , grave , kind not unfirm man who wo n't do anything eras offers little besides sobriety , stability , and feeling you get when you look at him that h not get us all blown to kingdom come . With that face he betokens long , dull , u , 1 safe evenings . And it is quite a face . stud ) carefully , stare at it till your eyes get teary , it begins to resemble the hind end of an elep all sags and bags and wrinkles , not pretty , reassuring the way an elephant is when seen the rear ; large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet that can be dainty avoiding small , furry ground animals , Lincolnesque. his admirers will say . Ma but it 's true that , more than any of the ci men who push themselves forward for consid tion , Muskie 's appeal is his personality , does n't have a program : he does n't need one , fact , it would hurt him , because his strop point is a diffuse and expanding goodwill decency that will get him elected if Mi Agnew/ Nixon wage a campaign of small IN ders and large libels . Edmund Muskie is ti backlash candidate of the people who abhor ger and rancor as governing principles in life . You may sniff and think that ai n't muc remember the squads of Mitchellisti issuing f from the Justice Department with their ins and close-clipped sideburns , their electric tie tacks , and their attach ? cases heavy with transcripts of phone conversations and gr jury indictments . The upcoming election is the wrong o sit out . There is a difference , even between and a Muskie , meandering and unformed as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark Cliffo and Harry McPhersons. old Johnson guys . advice . He 's using them already , but if you changed in the past couple of years , so h : they , and , if they 're incapable of overseeing turn in another direction that so much of Atm ' ica awaits , they will swing the prow a few poir. the hopeful way on the compass . By vote of those who claim to know , Masi has the worst staff of all . They mess up mailirqs fail to phone key contacts , leave important . politicos uncovered and open to be snappe4 by their man 's opponents . On the other ha the shambling Senator from Maine has been tacked by Evans and Novak for having h krd by the Trotskyites into blessing their dun , and very pacific antiwar march in e% ton last April . Any man who gets it from shisgoyak ca n't be wholly without character . not lacking in character is the South rota Methodist minister 's son . George McCoy-ile starts off with the handicap that almost 1 , ? dy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets on television and .10 he looks like the parson who inadvertently Allowed a pickle and is trying to make the its . aid society believe that he loves it . The man has the damnable look of the ordained out him , an institutional sweetness . Whenever 1 , , , e him you ca n't help imagining he 's wear- , winged collar or Geneva bands . Unfortu-rly for him , when he talks , the sound of his Lis is prissy , not thunderously evangelical , h , God only knows that 's not true of the content . Read this , delivered in the well of the We : We have foolishly assumed that the war was too complicated to be trusted to the people 's forum ? the Congress of the United States . The result has been the cruelest , the most barbaric , and the most stupid war in our national history . And every Senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave , This chamber reeks of blood ! Every Senator here is partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naval and all across our land ? young boys without legs or arms or genitals or faces or hopes . Do n't talk to them about bugging out or national honor or courage . It does n't take any courage at all for a Congressman or a Senator or a President to wrap himself in the flag and say we 're staying in Vietnam . Because it is n't our blood that is being shed . You 're not going to get a politician who is ore up front than that . Indeed , McGovern has been so up front that he is now accused of being a one-issue candidate . That , however , is one more issue than some of his rivals possess . Still , it he disadvantage in a contest against a man who Identified with no issue , and therefore has the flexibility that derives from being a warm , hiendly , reassuringly ill-defined blob . The McGovern candidacy is worth discussing il ( rin several angles . First off . the presence of the d Bobby people has caused some to speculate McGovern is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen one these quadrupeds , but in the city of marble rd the dome , they are sighted daily . McGovern a stalking-horse for Kennedy , and Fred Harris is too bruising and enervating an obsession for one of these ambitious , slightly tetched men to do it for somebody else . They are doing it for themselves , and Teddy , by every known yardstick ? the reports of his friends , the judgments of his former staff people , the opinion of his political allies ? is not running for President . In neither public nor private is he acting like a man who would turn around and run . But if McGovern is n't a stalking-horse , he assuredly is the foremost antiwar candidate , and beyond that , the man who most broadly and forcefully expresses the ideas of the liberal/left . This has brought a lot of young people to him and made him increasingly appear to be the purest and most uncompromised of the lot . The result is that if he loses the nomination ? and right now the odds are that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack it up and go home for the duration . That 's a fine attitude if you do n't care who stays in the White House , or if you regard your support of McGovern as part of your duties as a votary of some kind of religio-political mystery . Votaries , acolytes , and such can treat politics as a self-cleansing rite ; they can say . well , those are n't good enough , not pure enough , they do n't have the credentials . Nobody 's pure enough , Not even McGovern . For while he questioned the war as far back as 1963 , he voted for the Gulf of Tonkin resolution . which does n't make him a hum , but merely a politician who was wrong on that day . In truth . there are only a handful , a few thousand people over the age of twenty-four or twenty-five who ca n't legitimately he taxed with assorted sins or stupidities . Yet , long shot that he is , the South Dakota man could find himself nominated by the youth that is so attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the order of twenty-three million ( various figures are given ) people between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five who will be eligible to vote . Every indication suggests that they are heavily Democratic in their sympathies and more inclined toward George McGovern than to any of the others . If they should register in large numbers before the Miami convention next summer , the odds on the Senator could shorten . Darker horses LIT WILL THEY ? Past experience says no. people between the ages of twenty-one and five ve have tended not to vote , or , if they larent 0 they go along with their parents ' preferences . 0 , it is dogma among the hard-nosed political , , , e guys in Washington that this mass of votes , rich could be decisive ( Humphrey only lost by about a half a million ) , will either not show , polls or will distribute itself too evenly up at the have effect . This judgment is reinforced by the prevalent . ew that the campuses are quiet and apathetic , at people have chosen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the over tumult of the past several years . a lot of observers elieve they have descried apathy whenever they someplace where the ROTC building is n't beg firebombed. if you assume the opposite of apathy is riot , then there 's apathy . But pending the first tallies Of new registrants , there are other more instructive places to look . One of the most important is wherever Allard K. Lowenstein may be . Lowenstein , you may remember , was the one-term Long Island , New York , Congressman who toned the chimp-Johnson movement . He is one of those **29;2789;TOOLONG types who i ? now deeply involved in a nationwide effort to register the eighteen to twenty-threes . If he succeeds . he will be much more important to this election than any of the candidates , , hose names have been mentioned here . If he ( . in do it , and that means registering not all , but upwards of twelve million in this vote pool , he will scatter Humphrey , Jackson , the whole New Deal-Great Frontier-Fair Society groups ; he will imperil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGovern . But if Allard K. Lowenstein promises to he a principal figure in this election , there are a host of others in the running for the lesser or nonexistent positions . Ramsey Clark is a good if vague man who has repented of some of the things he did when he was Johnson 's Attorney General , but he has no base , only a smattering of sentimental support . John Gardner , founder of Common Cause . a coeducational League of Women Voters , is also admired . Republican that he is , for his dignified air and his concerned rectitude . All in all another decent chap , but politically about all Gardner has going for him IS that he looks like Warren Gamaliel Harding . who looked the way a President was supposed to look back in the days when banks were built with imitation classical facades . Another Republican who has no future in his own party but must look to the Democrats is John Vliet Lindsay , who would be the best-looking President since JFK , better looking , in fact , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platoons of Harvard Business School consultants . But is America ready to elect the man who nominated Spiro T. Agnew ? There is one last man . Congressman Paul McCloskey , Jr .. the California Republican who has announced his intention of going up against Nixon in the primaries . Some see in this a Republican version of the great McCarthy excursion against Johnson , but they do n't appreciate who votes in Republican primaries , and they fail to understand that the party that would nominate Nixon will renominate him . When they do that , they will still have failed to nominate their most depressingly frightful candidate , the scourge of youth , that enemy of welfare loafers everywhere and friend of oil and agri-business , California 's own Ronald Reagan . But Reagan is getting old and increasingly unpopular in his home state , so that whatever scant chances he may have depend on Nixon 's pulling out and doing what Johnson did in 1968 . That 's not going to happen either -- Nixon is n't smart enough to know when he is beaten . If he were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to the President will have to come from one of the flawed Democrats . but flawed though they may be , you ca n't even heat a nobody like Nixon with a nobody-nobody . Modest hopes and moral lectures S ? rit.t . MANY PEOPLE are going to shrug and say , ' ' It 's not worth it , it wo n't work , we 've tried everything and it 's all failed . " Most of the people who talk like that have n't tried everything . They 've rung a few doorbells in a couple of campaigns . attended a few teach-ins and maybe been in an antiwar parade . If stopping a war , altering the foreign policy , dealing with racism ? if any of these objectives were so easy that a mass stroll with a folk singer could accomplish them , they would scarcely be important enough to trouble ourselves over . To bellyache that universal world peace does n't come easily I in , for example , a handy-open , pop-top , nonreturnable , costumer-convenience container ) is dilettantism . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agitation of the past ten years have brought to thought and practice in every part of American life . Look at what has happened to the black people of the country . Granting that the end of their difficulties is not yet in sight , just that short time ago their leadership consisted of Roy Wilkins and A. Philip Randolph ; white allies were scarce , and Bayard Rustin was the big black radical . In the intervening time , not only the outreaching demand but this thinking and self-definition of a whole people has been transformed . From that beginning in the old civil-rights movement , change has begat change upon change . Ralph Nader has moved from being a guy who was lucky to get printed in The Nation into being a bigger problem than Volkswagen for General Motors ; in other areas the idea of self-determination has been reintroduced as a powerful political issue in our life . The notion that all the benefits America does confer on a few must be shared by all has been converted from a utopian bromide into a snarled and snaggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , foreign policy has been taken out of the poisonous ambience of bipartisan consensus . Not only has Congress been forced to resume its responsibilities and begin to debate what we do abroad , but the crisis managers , the military , and all the foxy gentlemen who play the Free World interventionist game have been made to realize that American lives and money are no longer obediently and unquestionably at their disposal . To arrest the U.S.A. in the middle of one of its wars is a feat . In a decade , every part of our public life has been changed , blown so hard in new directions that even Nixon gives lip service to many of the ideas promulgated by the SDS in the mid-Sixties . Belatedly and without serious intent , he too feels he must call for revolution , for health insurance , and some form of participatory democracy . Another proof of how the country has moved is the way the Democratic party will pick its candidate next year . As a result of the 1968 Chicago convention there have been enormous and fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked at the Miami convention and who is eligible to join the delegates in the picking process . These changes probably will be more important than who is chosen : they will shape his politics no matter who he may be or what his personal thinking is at the moment . For the first time in American history , the convention will not be a meeting of middle-aged white men . At Chicago in 1968 , according to the figures of the Democratic National Committee , 13 per cent of the delegates were women . 5.5 per cent were black , and 4 per cent were under the age of thirty . A third of them had been all but in 1967 so that their selection completely sicippe , the galvanic events of the convention year 's t ; pestuous and tragic spring . None of that at Miami next summer , In terrn of race , sex , and age ( between eighteen aH thirty I. the delegates must be roughly pr ,  | ) t , tional to their numbers in the population at large . Not only must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention , but also it will longer be possible for governors or national corn . mitteemen to stack the deck by planting their friends and cronies in each state delegation ? That 's gone . Gone too are many of the sly rriov , that professional politicians have used to rnakt , access to the election process as difficult as  |p0  , sible for the concerned amateur . State Democratic parties must now have , formal set of printed rules under which they 0 P. crate . None of the shifting and nutshelling that allowed them to hide precinct meetings or squee. gee people out by telling them they hadn ' followed some regulation of which they we deliberately kept in ignorance . That 's all gone as is the unit rule , the favorite son , hokey font demonstrations , and much of the rest of the tricknology and sham that have helped make political conventions dull . disreputable , infuriat ? ing , and undemocratic . Not that all the changes and new rules will hp ' been carried out . Many state organizations will h shifty and recalcitrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , new way of doing bun ' ness is under way , past the point of backslidin The Miami convention will be different , cer tainly different enough to persuade many tha although they believed they could n't work in t old system , their efforts have brought forth . if not a new system , at least one that a lot morn people with a lot less money can get their hank on and use . It may also be that these changes 41 not move the Democrats nearly so far in a liberal/ left direction as some hope and others fear : but what it certainly ought to do is bring to the public a new kind of candidate . Whichever of these men wins , he will not have been able to do it as John Kennedy did , with some kind of " ki ) Mafia " machination , or as Johnson gave it t ' Humphrey , after first stripping him of his diP nits . and then tossing him the nomination af .. thing not worth having . The Miami candidate , whoever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should emerge with a special authority that comes to one chosen by a process people believe in. and that alone . this time of disillusion and disrespect. may worth more than winning the election .
