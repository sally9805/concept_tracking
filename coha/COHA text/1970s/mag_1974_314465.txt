The sacrament of penance , known more familiarly to Roman Catholics as " confession , " has fallen on lean days . Where quiet lines of penitents once gathered to wait near the confessional boxes on a Saturday , a priest may now sit on the church steps waiting wistfully for even one sinner to show up . The reasons for the sacrament 's neglect are probably many : a severe drop in church attendance , a new theology of sin that does not stress the damning " mortal " sins of pre-Vatican II days , an avoidance of confession by some who practice contraception , or an increasing reluctance to enter dark , close quarters to recite one 's sins to an unseen judge . <P> Despite church disapproval , some Catholics have chosen to think of the new penitential prayers in the Mass as their " confession . " Others , particularly on college campuses and in progressive parishes , have been taking part in unauthorized communal rites of penance , acknowledging their sins inwardly while a priest gives " general absolution " -a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church-a combination of a communal celebration of the sacrament with brief individual confessions and absolution - has won wide acceptance in many U.S. parishes . As for more leisurely individual confessions that require some counseling , many penitents have in recent years shunned the confessional to meet their priest in more normal surroundings-in a parish office , for instance-for a face-to-face talk . <P> Last week the Vatican issued a long set of new rules formalizing some of the experiments but sharply limiting others . For individual confessions , the rules encourage the use of a room set aside for the purpose , require that the priest greet the penitent warmly with a reminder of God 's forgiving nature , and read a passage of Scripture with a reconciliation theme . The new norms stress the sacrament as a rite of " reconciliation " between the sinner , his neighbor and his God , and try to give that conciliatory flavor to the encounter between priest and penitent . <P> The document approves warmly of communal rites , which the Vatican seems to want to establish as the basic , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rules insist , must incorporate individual confession and individual absolution for each penitent-a somewhat cumbersome procedure . General absolution is in most cases forbidden . To the disappointment of liberals , it will be largely confined to mission areas , where a single priest may have to deal with large crowds of penitents in limited time .
