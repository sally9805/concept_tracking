An impresario , the late Sol Hurok used to say , " is a man who discovers talent , who promotes it , who presents it , and who puts up the money and takes the risk . " In Hurok 's case , the impresario was also a man who changed and enriched the taste of a people and persuaded nations to become cultural friends . For more than 50 years he brought to the U.S. the performing geniuses of his native Russia : Pavlova , Chaliapin , Oistrakh , Ulanova . His proudest accomplishment ? " Bringing ballet to America and the American public to ballet . " <P> Although he was in effect a one-man operation , Hurok liked to underplay his own indispensability . " A lot of people are mistaken when they say that if Hurok disappears his organization will fall apart , " he would say . " It 'll go on , as long as they have the artists . " Last week - two years after Hurok died at the age of 85-the current management of Hurok Concerts conceded that almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stampede out of Hurok began one of the biggest shake-ups in the concert business . Items : <P> &gt; In a major reorganization announced last week , Hurok Concerts worked out a deal with a smaller , rival manager , Harold Shaw , 53 , and gave him most of its artistic leadership . Shaw will continue to run his own company , Shaw Concerts , which handles such artists as Guitarist Julian Bream , Contralto Maureen Forrester and Pianist Vladimir Horowitz . A merger may be possible in the future , but for now the move is comparable to Ford turning operations over to American Motors . <P> &gt; Sheldon Gold , 46 , who was with Hurok for 15 years , emerged as a powerful force in the management field . Last May , shortly after he was fired as Hurok 's president , Gold announced the formation of his own firm , ICM Artists Ltd . Since then , the agency has signed up such onetime Hurok clients as Violinists Isaac Stern and Pinchas Zukerman ; Pianists Claudio Arrau , Vladimir Ashkenazy , Gina Bachauer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Julius Rudel ; and Dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov . Zukerman switched , he explained , because " Shelly Gold is more than a manager to me . He 's a close friend . I get a lot from Shelly , a lot more than the 20% . " Added Stern : " I do n't want to say anything bad about the new people at Hurok . But they are not very experienced . I do n't have time for kindergarten . " One of the co-owners of Hurok , President Maynard Goldman , 38 , takes a philosophic stance : " Historically , artists are going to leave managements and go to others . " Nonetheless , Goldman and his partner , Paul Del Rossi , 33 , are suing Gold and ICMA for $4 million - $1 million for loss of commissions and $3 million in punitive damages . <P> &gt; Perhaps the most important outcome of the turmoil at Hurok may be that the U.S. will be seeing less of what was once the impresario 's greatest pride : the famous international dance , symphonic and opera troupes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is presenting an 18-week season at the Met . This week the National Ballet of Canada comes in . In September the Paris Opera arrives .
