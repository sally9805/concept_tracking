Few people in Washington are more uncomfortable these days than House Speaker Carl Bert Albert , the " Little Giant " from Bug Tussle , Okla . It is he who set in motion the proceedings that could lead to the impeachment of Richard Nixon . It is he who stands next in line of succession to the presidency until Congress confirms House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford as Vice President . For many politicians , those would be heady circumstances , but Albert relishes neither role . He wants Ford to be confirmed " as quickly as possible , " and he fervently hopes , " for the country 's sake , " that Nixon will be exonerated . That would free the 26-year veteran of the House to resume his duties as Speaker unencumbered by a constitutional crisis , unthreatened by awesome responsibilities he does not seek . <P> Albert at 65 has no desire for higher office . Born in an unpainted shack in McAlester , Okla. , he was raised in nearby Bug Tussle ( later renamed Flowery Mound ) , after his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a student in a one-room schoolhouse , Albert developed a love of reading ( chiefly history and biography ) . He used his $1,500 winnings as a champion high school orator to continue his education at the University of Oklahoma , where he graduated with a Phi Beta Kappa key and a Rhodes scholarship . <P> At Oxford , he earned two degrees , then in 1934 returned to Oklahoma to practice law . In 1941 , he enlisted in the Army as a private , emerging five years later a lieutenant colonel . Then , adopting the slogan FROM THE CABIN IN THE COTTON TO THE CAPITOL , he won election to Congress from Oklahoma 's " Little Dixie " district , which borders on the late Speaker Sam Rayburn 's district in Texas . Albert entered the House in 1947 , the same year as freshmen Representatives John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon . <P> Iron Backbone . In Congress , Albert became extraordinarily popular . Small ( 5 ft. 4 in. , 150 Ibs. ) and self-effacing , he showed himself to be considerate of other members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker and gifted parliamentarian , he became assistant Democratic leader in 1955 under Rayburn , who called him " one of the greatest whips the House has ever known . " With the death of Rayburn in 1961 , Albert was promoted to party floor leader . He became Speaker in 1971 , after the retirement of John W. McCormack . <P> Even as Speaker , Albert is rarely in the public eye . He lives quietly in a modest apartment in northwest Washington with his wife Mary , a former Pentagon clerk . They have two children : David , 18 , a student at Harvard , and Mary Frances , 25 , who teaches high school in Washington . To keep his weight down , Albert jogs and swims . He is seldom seen on the cocktail circuit , devotes himself to his family and his work , and his strongest expletive is " jeepers creepers . " <P> Albert operates much as Rayburn did-backstage , without seeking publicity or notoriety . Instead of twisting arms , he works for cooperation and consensus . But the very qualities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Representatives to doubt that he had , in Rayburn 's phrase , the " iron in his backbone " needed to be an effective Speaker .
