<P> Among the phenomena of the 1950s was the rise of the violent urban gangs with their freewheeling , sometimes lethal " rumbles " in protection of their " turf . " By the mid- ' 60s , gangs seemed to be on the wane , their vital energies either drawn into the protest movements of that era or sapped by the burgeoning drug culture . <P> Now in several of America 's largest cities , the gangs are back-and with some ominous differences . Older , better armed , more sophisticated , the gangs today operate in all too deadly earnest . New York City has had 27 gang-related murders reported this year-ten of them in the seething South Bronx , where 877 gang arrests have taken place in 1973 . In Chicago the gangs have largely graduated to big-time crime as profiteers in guns , extortion and gambling . Los Angeles has nearly 200 gangs , more than 40 of which are black or Chicano . Their clashes have caused 16 deaths this year . <P> Nowhere are the new gangs more virulently active than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city is committed by juveniles ; in the past five years 191 youngsters have died in gang wars and gang-related assassinations . TIME Correspondent Barrett Seaman spent some time on the streets of the City of Brotherly Love and sent this report : <P> <P> In Philadelphia , a gang is called a " corner , " and a gang leader is a " runner " or a " checkholder .

" I keep everybody together , plan any action we might take , " he explains coolly . Just then a corner member , who looks to be no more than nine or ten , points a finger and yells : " Three dudes coming up . Looks like warrin ' time .

Fortunately , a cruising police car happens by before the two groups collide , and the antagonists melt into studied casual poses . " They know there 's gon na be trouble , " observes a Montgomery . " Norris is gon na move on us tonight , and the Man 's got the word . " <P> The Montgomerys and the Norrises are among the estimated 100 to 200 gangs that roam the black neighborhoods of West and North Philadelphia . Most of the gangs have memberships of no more than 30 or 40 teenagers , and in some cases their territory is quite literally no more than a corner or a block at best . The rules of sovereignty-and survival-are strict . The difference between life and death can often depend on whether a boy walks on one side of a street or the other . Forays by an individual or a group into the territory of another gang are a justifiable cause for all out combat . The slightest provocation-a little back talk in a school corridor , a random surreptitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taunting gesture from a block 's distance-can plunge corners into a war that may last for two or three years .
