txt The questions now being debated by the Soviet Press provide some indication of the Kremlin 's own debates about the summit talks with the United States . " Some people may be asking , " says the Army 's top political officer , Gen. Alexei Yepishev , whether it is worth " giving so much attention " to defense preparations at a time when detente is making progress . General Yepishev , the head of the political administration of the armed forces , answered their questions in the party 's main journal , Kommunist . Their views , he said , were " absolutely incorrect , " because steps toward peace " must be accompanied by the intensification of all our military readiness . " Another question at issue is whether detente should be regarded as lasting . After all , says another article , there had been international thaws before , in the ' 50 's . But they were " short-lived , " and when they expired " the cold war broke out with anew vigor . " The answer given to the skeptics is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relation of forces " in favor of the Soviet Union , and that detente will therefore last . Energy deals questioned Yet another issue is whether the Soviet Union should mortgage its natural resources to the West for many years to come under the huge oil and gas deals being negotiated with the United States and other countries . Soviet 011 Minister Valentin D. Shashin hinted at his opposition to such sales in a recent interview , but an official Tass denial said that his remarks were not to be interpreted in this way . A Moscow television program , however , sought to quiet the fears of certain " comrades " who argued that the sales would have a " detrimental effect " on the Soviet economy . " We need gas , coal , and oil ourselves , " they maintained . There were shortages of fuel in some areas , yet " now we are preparing to sell them . " They asked : " Wo n't be using up most of our natural riches by selling them abroad ? " Highest-level issue When Soviet ministers hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote similar views ? if only to describe them as " imaginary fears " ? it must be presumed that the battle on this issue has been joined at the highest level , that is , in the Politburo itself . In Washington , the parallel struggle may be discerned more easily when Sen. Henry M. Jackson denounces Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger 's plans to pour American money into Russia . When Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger says that his own differences with Dr. Kissinger on the terms of a summit arms limitation // *Kremlin urging caution in summit talks // deal are " very much exaggerated , " that they are " differences of emphasis " only , some Washington analysts regard it as confirmation of deep disagreements at the top . Mr. Schlesinger 's opposite number in Moscow , Defense Minister Andrei A. Grechko , is more cautious about revealing Kremlin disagreements . The Politburo , he says , takes account not only of the most likely course of events ? that is , the further progress of detente ? but also is ready for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , he seems to be commending General-Secretary Leonid I. Brezhnev for being ready for the worst . But General Yepishev puts the same remark in a context which shows that this is an attack on Mr. Brezhnev . History , he says , warns against the underestimation of the danger of war ? whether such underestimation is deliberate or " involuntary . " He is saying , in effect , by accepting U.S. proposals for arms limitation , that some Soviet leaders are underestimating the danger , even if they are not doing so deliberately . Or , as Secretary Schlesinger put it in discussing a summit arms deal , Mr. Nixon would not " intentionally " damage the security of the United States . The implication that he might do so unintentionally echoes the Soviet hawks ' warning to their own boss . Secretary Schlesinger says that it is " premature " to complain that Mr. Nixon will be induced by Watergate to make concessions at the summit , and tells the President 's critics to " await the results of the Moscow meeting before coming to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a veiled threat of resignation if Mr. Nixon should go too far at the summit believe that the President will pay heed to the warning . Mr. Brezhnev regards Mr. Schlesinger and those who share his views as " supporters of the arms race . " They argue , Mr. Brezhnev said in his latest speech discussing the summit preparations , that to limit arms or to reduce them " means taking a risk . " But he was replying to both Western and Soviet " supporters of the arms race " when he said that there is " an immeasurably greater risk " in continuing to accumulate arms . There were those in the " foreign " press , he said , who were pessimistic about the possible results of the summit . Some matters , he conceded , were not yet ripe for solution , " but , comrades , we can not mark time . " Was he replying to people in Moscow who believe , as some believe in Washington , that the summit can accomplish little more than mark time ? What may be discerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Brezhnev is under pressure to make no concessions to Mr. Nixon , just as Mr. Nixon is under pressure to make no concessions to Mr. Brezhnev .
