Are placebos magic or real ? <P> A bit of whimsy making the medical rounds has a pharmaceutical company petitioning the Food and Drug Administration for approval of a new pain reliever . The compound , to be packaged in red , white and blue capsules , will be sold with a label that is indisputably true : PROVED EFFECTIVE IN ONE-THIRD OF ALL CASES AND ABSOLUTELY SAFE . The nostrum 's name : Placebo . <P> Long the butt of jokes , placebos ( from the Latin for " I shall please " ) are one of the oldest , most useful and least understood " remedies " in the doctor 's satchel . Generally they come as pills of milk sugar or talc or as injections of salt water . Such substances are considered pharmacologically inert , incapable of eliciting a response when prescribed in reasonable quantities . Yet studies have repeatedly shown that placebos help as many as 30% or 40% of patients with real enough ills , including postoperative pain , migraines , coughs , seasickness , arthritis , ulcers , hypertension , hay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placebo 's magic , doctors have resorted to virtually every kind of psychological and physical explanation . No luck . Drs . Jon D. Levine and Howard I. Fields and Oral Surgeon Newton C. Gordon , all of the University of California in San Francisco , may have hit upon an answer . In an experiment involving dental patients having molars extracted , they gave them either a placebo or the drug naloxone , which is known to block the effects of endorphin , a morphine-like pain reliever produced by the brain itself . <P> To guard against any unwitting influences on the patients or themselves , the doctors did not know which " drug " was being used in any particular case until the end of the test . In the first phase of the experiment , patients who had received placebos experienced less pain than those in the naloxone group . But when the experiment was continued , patients initially in the placebo group but now getting the blocker experienced an increase in pain . In other words , the placebo response diminished . Levine 's explanation : somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorphin . Says he : " Placebos are not just in people 's minds but in their brains . " <P> Perhaps so . But Psychiatrist Arthur K. Shapiro of Manhattan 's Mt . Sinai Medical Center points out that the placebo effect may also be influenced by attitudes of patient and doctor toward drugs and , perhaps more important , toward each other . In fact , says Shapiro , who has collected hundreds of the " useless " nostrums over the years , patient confidence in a physician may be a kind of placebo too , increasing chances of improvement . <P> Dr. Herbert Benson of Boston 's Beth Israel Hospital agrees with that common-sense notion . Well known for his work on the physiological effects experienced by practitioners of Transcendental Meditation , he has recently reviewed studies of patients suffering from angina , a severe chest pain related to heart disease . He found that when physicians were initially enthusiastic about a remedy , even if it later proved worthless by ordinary medical definition , it acted as a placebo in about 80% of all cases .
