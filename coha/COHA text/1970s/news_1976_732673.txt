The poor outlook in the South probably helped steer . Mr. Ford away from Sen. Howard Baker of Tennessee , who had been under serious consideration as a running mate . Sen. Robert J. Dole of Kansas will help the President in the vast Midwest farm belt , where Republican policies have drawn bitter criticism . The new Ford-Dole team starts far behind in the polls . But those same polls offer genuine hope for the Republicans . In the West , for example , less than a third of Mr. Carter 's support is con-sidered " strong , " according to a sampling just released by the Harris Poll . In the Midwest , more than 60 percent of the voters who say they are for Mr. Carter are considered " wavering , " and in the East 56 percent are similarly soft in their support of the Democratic ticket .

But it is known his strategists see certain states as pivotal : " New South " states like Texas and Florida ; border states like Maryland and Kentucky ; industrial states like Indiana ; big population states like New York and Pennsylvania . If the Harris Poll offered Mr. Ford hope , it also contained a sobering view of his own standing with the voters .

Some 76 percent of his supporters are considered " wavering . " The President 's best standing was in the West , where 30 percent of his support was strong . Among religious groups , Mr : Ford runs best among protestants , but still loses there to Mr. Carter 37 to 58 percent . Among Roman Catholics , Mr. Ford loses 31 to 57 , and among Jewish voters , 23 to 72 . But two of every three Roman Catholic voters who support Mr. Carter do so without enthusiasm . This appears to offer Mr. Ford a good target .
