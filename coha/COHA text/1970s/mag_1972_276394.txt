The ad , which ran in the A.M.A. Journal and other professional publications last June , was similar to hundreds of other pitches for drugs . Aimed at the doctors who write prescriptions , Lederle Laboratories ' illustrated three-page spread implied , among other things , that Minocin is superior to all other available tetracyclines and effective against a strain of staphylococcus bacteria . Yet a follow-up ad , which ran in the same journals nearly three months later , was strikingly different . It quoted a statement by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that the earlier claims were misleading . It also conceded that Minocin is a tetracycline variation with all the limitations of similar medications , and that tetracyclines are not the first choice in fighting staphylococcus infections . <P> Lederle is only one of many established companies to make such a confession . In recent months , for instance , Sandoz Pharmaceuticals has retracted some of its claims for its trademarked tranquilizer Serentil . Marion Laboratories has acknowledged that Triten is chemically similar to at least one antihistamine . Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp . has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in no way superior to other contraceptives with similar ingredients . All told , 15 companies , including most of the country 's major drug manufacturers have publicly admitted errors in advertising 23 out of the thousands of drugs on sale . On 33 other occasions , the pharmaceutical houses have sent out " Dear Doctor " letters to every practicing physician in the country , informing them of misstatements in advertising or other promotional material . Such candor is now compulsory . Under a 1964 law , the FDA adopted various regulations to ensure the accuracy and truthfulness of prescription-drug advertising. * <P> Initially the regulations proved hard to enforce as pharmaceutical producers complied slowly , if at all . When the FDA tried criminal and civil litigation , it found that cases took as long as three years to conclude . Wanting faster service , the FDA switched to " Operation Candor , " and required companies whose advertising it found misleading to notify physicians by first-class mail . More recently , the agency began to require remedial advertising , specifying that the corrections must appear in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement . Of late , this policy has been carried out vigorously . <P> Drug manufacturers are increasingly unhappy about the FDA approach . With more than 300,000 practicing physicians in the country , the cost of a letter to each can easily exceed $40,000 . A two-page spread in the A.M.A. Journal alone can set a company back a minimum of $5,000 . So far , however , no company has refused an FDA request for recantation . Nor is one likely to , for the alternative could be even more expensive . The law gives the FDA the authority-upheld in five cases-to seize any drug that it deems mislabeled . <P> <P> *The Federal Trade Commission , which oversees advertising for nonprescription drugs , recently cited three manufacturers of patented headache remedies for misleading claims . The commission has sought but not yet won their agreement to devote 25% of their advertising budgets for the next two years to remedial ads.
