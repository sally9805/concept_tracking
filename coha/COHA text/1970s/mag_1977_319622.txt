TRUE CONFESSIONS by John Gregory Dunne Dutton ; 341 pages ; $9.95 <P> " Tommy liked to tell stories about the lowest kind of human behavior . " The storyteller , Thomas Spellacy , is a 72-year-old retired Los Angeles cop who has either witnessed or heard them all . <P> There are the ones about a rapist who preyed on the elderly , the hood who stuffed a rival into a laundry dryer , a sort of Jack the Shaver who depilated his victims with a razor , and the tale about the monsignor who died in a brothel : the police dressed him and propped him in his car , which they parked at a shopping center . It was piously announced that the prelate had suffered a heart attack while reaching for his glove compartment . <P> Spellacy 's own career was blotched by petty corruption , his private life by weaknesses of the flesh . Still he remains cheerful , for like his brother the Rt . Rev. Desmond Spellacy , chancellor of the Los Angeles archdiocese and an outstanding golfer , Tommy knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wickedness offers the double pleasure of sinning and confessing . <P> True Confessions , John Gregory Dunne 's first novel , is Tom Spellacy 's unrepentant recollections of his life as a tarnished blue knight . He proves to be a gifted , foulmouthed raconteur who can charm the reader down to a plane where cynicism and sentimentality are indistinguishable and the difference between social history and gossip is irrelevant . His " book " on Lois Fazenda , a would-be starlet whose naked body was found neatly cut in two at the torso : " She lived in a series of boarding houses much like the one on North Cherokee . On West Adams Boulevard she thought she was pregnant . On Camino Palmero she hemorrhaged . On North Orange Drive she was tattooed ... On Linden Drive in Long Beach she left behind a poem that said , ' Remember me and keep in mind/ A faithful friend is hard to find . ' " <P> The style has a touch of Raymond Chandler ; the Fazenda case has a fleeting similarity to the unsolved 1940s Black Dahlia murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enliven its central incident : a 28-year-old murder known as the " case of the Virgin Tramp . " <P> For Author Dunne , whose credits include Vegas : A Memoir of a Dark Season , The Studio , Delano and film scripts written with his wife , Novelist Joan Didion , Lois Fazenda is the hapless fly that jiggles a grotesque web of relationships . As Spellacy discovers , the path of the victim 's life crisscrossed his own world of Irish-American Los Angeles just after World War II . It is a lively place where an archbishop plays weekly croquet with Samuel Goldwyn , a hard-luck punk goes to the gas chamber for kidnaping a girl on V-J day , and a leading Catholic contractor short-weights the church . It is also a place where , as Spellacy reminds us , new money and social pretensions can not disguise the old-country " harps . " On the fringes is an assortment of pimps , prostitutes , pornographers and eccentrics who seem cast from what the author has elsewhere referred to as the " freak-death pages " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trip on its tangled plot lines . Yet Dunne manages to get them through with wit , vitality , affection and that uncommon commodity , good writing . - R.Z.S.
