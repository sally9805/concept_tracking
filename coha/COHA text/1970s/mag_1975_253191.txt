If economists ' predictions for the coming year could be symbolically represented by a painting , it would be a portrait in muted pastels-no dazzling rosy hues , no daubs of black . The recovery from the worst slump since the Great Depression will continue at a steady but unspectacular pace . Unemployment and inflation will both come down , slowly and moderately . It will be a year of transition-but will the transition be to a new period of balanced growth or a time of stagnation ? <P> Economists are deeply divided on that question . But there is strikingly little disagreement on what can be expected for the coming year . The pastel predictions come from Government officials and businessmen , university , bank and corporate economists . They agree with all eight members of TIME 's Board of Economists , who gathered in Manhattan last week for a day-long examination of the outlook for 1976 ( Alan Greenspan , who is on leave from the board while he serves as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , attended the meeting as an observer ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here are the board 's key predictions : <P> &gt;Production of goods and services , discounted for inflation , will rise about 6.2% for the year . That will make 1976 a year of growth after the longest downturn since 1947-48 ; real gross national product dropped 2% in 1974 and probably will be down a shade under 3% in 1975 . But the growth rate will slow at least a bit by the end of 1976 , unless Government policy changes unexpectedly . <P> &gt; Unemployment will decline to an average rate of 7.7% of the labor force , and perhaps to 7.4% by the end of 1976 . That would mark a very slow decline from the last reported rate of 8.3% ( for November ) . Main reason : an expansion in G.N.P . of roughly 6% just is not enough to bring about a faster reduction ; economists generally figure that a 4% growth rate is needed merely to prevent an increase in joblessness as new people enter the labor force . <P> &gt; Inflation will slow to an average rate of 6.6% , as measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that by year 's end . That would contrast with a 7.6% increase in retail prices in the twelve months ended last October and a horrifying 11% in 1974 . On this one point , however , there are some serious disagreements in the predictions . Beryl Sprinkel , executive vice president and economist of Chicago 's Harris Trust &; Savings Bank , sees the end-of-1976 inflation rate at a low 5% ; Robert Nathan , head of his own consulting firm , forecasts a startlingly high 9.5% . <P> &gt; Corporate profits , which already are staging a vigorous comeback from their recession lows , will go on climbing and could wind up next year 20% to 30% higher than in 1975 . <P> No forecast is ever certain , of course , and the near unanimity of the board 's predictions mildly worries some members . It indicates that they are all operating on the same assumptions about how the economy works-which could be wrong in some important respects .                   @ @
