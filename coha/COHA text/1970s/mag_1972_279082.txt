It may all be Zero Mostel 's fault . <P> In the 1968 film The Producers , he played a zany impresario dedicated to staging a Broadway musical called Springtime for Hitler , a rococo recounting of the good old days in the Thousand Year Reich . Against all expectations , Mostel 's musical was a smash - which turns out to have been prophetic . In the entertainment world nowadays , Hitler 's springtime does indeed seem to have arrived . <P> In London , the cameras are turning on Hitler-The Last Ten Days , and Sir Alec Guinness , complete with toothbrush mustache and special black hair piece , is playing the Fhrer . A spoof on Hitler 's return , starring Peter Sellers , goes into production next year .

Sandy Lieberson , a partner in the British syndicate that owns screen rights to the book , says that while Hitler will figure in their movie , they will eschew a name actor for the role in order to avoid critical comparisons between their Hitler and that of Sir Alec . <P> Guinness has worked hard on Hitlerian mannerisms : the walk , the deep , throaty voice , the oddly limp salute .

At that time , says Guinness , " Hitler was almost senile ; at the age of 56 , he was 70 . He took pep pills , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get the giggles . I try to convey that comic side .

In persuading Guinness to take the part , De Concini recalls , " I told him I saw the last days in the bunker like floating into nowhere in a first-class jumbo jet . You go into unreality , between life and death-der Fhrer crying , Eva Braun dancing to Tea for Two , the Nazi empire falling into destruction . I wanted to film all this in the manner of an 8-mm. movie . " <P> Almost the only set for the movie is a replica of the Fhrerbunker , complete with German magazines of the period and other authentic memorabilia . Through it drift re-creations of the familiar faces of three decades ago : Braun , Martin Bormann , Joseph Goebbels and Alfred Jodl . In his scenes , Guinness strives for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start playing a person , it becomes unbelievable if you have him snarling all the time , " he says . " I try to indicate a certain sympathy-the sympathy I have for a childish murderer like Macbeth . "
