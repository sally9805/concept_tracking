Samuel Johnson once proposed that if Bishop Berkeley and other metaphysicians doubted the physical existence of things , they might reassure themselves by kicking a rock : those who had trouble arriving at reality abstractly would find that their feet would tell them the truth . A similar standard of common sense should govern lawyers and judges in their continuing debate over fair trials and a free press in the U.S. At the heart of this classic tension between two democratic principles is the question of whether jurors are capable of rendering a conscientious and just verdict even in cases they may have read about widely before they entered the courtroom . Recently , the legal fallout from two extraordinary events , the My Lai massacre and Watergate , has raised - and confused-the issue once again . <P> President Ford had been scheduled to testify two weeks ago before a congressional subcommittee about his reasons for pardoning Richard Nixon . He delayed that appearance until last week , after the jurors had been selected and sequestered for the Watergate cover-up trial , lest his testimony prejudice the jurors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of words about Watergate have already cascaded upon the American people that the Watergate defendants , if convicted , will surely appeal in any case on the grounds that among other things , a fair trial was impossible after so much publicity , no matter what Ford said . <P> The other event that reopened the fair-trial , free-press issue came last month , when Federal District Court Judge J. Robert Elliott reversed the conviction of William Galley and ordered him released from confinement in the My Lai case . Elliott 's foremost argument was that " massive adverse pretrial publicity " had prevented the six-officer panel at Galley 's court-martial in 1971 from considering the case without prejudice and that , therefore , he had not been fairly tried . <P> Hard cases , it is said , make bad law . Watergate and My Lai are two of the hardest cases in recent American history , for each is freighted with immense emotional and symbolic meaning . Each involves trial of subordinates while the crime may lie higher up the chain of command . The My Lai massacre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American venture in Viet Nam . Enemies of U.S. policy seized upon the event to dramatize their case . The Army , anxious to protect its name , sought to isolate the tragedy and its participants as untypical of military performance . Yet beneath the cloud of symbolism and larger issues , there remain the essential legal questions : Was William Galley indeed guilty as charged ? Did the circumstances permit a panel of his fellow officers to judge his case fairly ?
