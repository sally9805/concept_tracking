Just as the testimony at one trial was ending at Fort Benning , more atrocities were being described 100 miles away at Atlanta 's Fort McPherson . Lieut . Colonel Anthony B. Herbert , a 40-year-old veteran of combat in Korea and Viet Nam , was drafting military charges against a general and a colonel whom he accused of covering up war crimes that occurred two years ago . The officers are Major General John Barnes , an ex-brigade commander , and Colonel Joseph R. Franklin , who was a member of the Army 's Peers Panel that investigated the My Lai Massacre . <P> Colonel Herbert maintains that when he served under Barnes and Franklin in Viet Nam , he reported to them a number of incidents involving murder , torture and mistreatment of prisoners ; Herbert claims to have witnessed four such episodes . After one battle with the Viet Cong , he says , units of his battalion took some 15 prisoners , who were then put in custody of South Vietnamese troops accompanied by an American lieutenant . <P> " There were four dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They had a knife at the throat of a woman . Her baby was screaming and clutching at her leg , and her other child was being suffocated by a South Vietnamese infantryman who was shoving its face into the sand with his foot . I ordered them to stop , but with me just standing there looking , they proceeded to slit the woman 's throat . I asked the lieutenant what the hell was going on , ordered him to get out of the area and take the ARVN with him , and they left . " <P> Later , said Herbert , all the remaining prisoners were killed : " I went over there and they were all dead , the children too . When I reported the incident to Franklin , he said I was a liar and that I was exaggerating . " <P> Herbert , who as an enlisted man was the most decorated U.S. soldier in the Korean War , won a Silver Star , three Bronze Stars and an Army Commendation medal during his ten-month tour in Viet Nam . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that if I was so damned morally offended by that , I should think about leaving . " Herbert was relieved of his command on April 4 , 1969 . The Army says it is investigating Herbert 's charges , but he reports that he has been repeatedly told " to cool it , " because , as one officer at Fort McPherson told him , " We do n't want another My Lai .
