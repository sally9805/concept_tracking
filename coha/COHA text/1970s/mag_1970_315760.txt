Against the unknown and against the foe our borders will spread-From sea to sea and mountain to mountain . <P> ARIEL ( " ARIK " ) SHARON , the paratroop general who heads the southern command of Israel 's defense forces , is so fond of the Hebrew couplet that he has hung it over the entrance of his Beersheba headquarters . But the exuberant confidence that once made it so fitting has disappeared in Israel . A note of doubt is creeping in . From Mount Hermon down to the Red Sea , Israel dispatched her Arab foes with relative ease in three wars . But now there is a new unknown to cope with in the form of Russia 's dramatically increased presence in the Middle East , and it is an ominous one . Said one Israeli last week : " We are knocking out every Egyptian gun we can find , probably hundreds in recent months . But no sooner do we destroy them than two days later the Russians replace them . It 's like a science-fiction plot-a war against an endless army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel 's alarm , has vastly revived the Arabs ' enthusiasm for battle . From Israel 's point of view , the fighting between Arab fedayeen and Arab soldiers in Jordan last week was only one scene , and not necessarily an encouraging one , in a far broader theater . Even while gunfire blazed in Amman , other guerrillas raided Israel along the Jordanian border . Israeli troops patrolled inside Lebanon to contain guerrilla activity there , but the fedayeen nevertheless managed to loft Soviet-made Katyusha rockets into the frontier town of Kiryat Shemona . Syrian artillerymen firing Russian guns shelled a border defense settlement called Nahal Gishor , killing a girl soldier . Suez rocked with the sound and fury of the heaviest fighting of all . <P> <P> Last Resort <P> If Moscow 's infusion of men and missiles has not yet altered the region 's strategic balance , it certainly has stirred misgivings , not only in Israel but also in the U.S. It has , moreover , pushed President Nixon closer to a decision that is certain to hurt Washington in every Arab capital and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week overshadowed and probably delayed the decision , but did not reverse it . Some time in the near future the Nixon Administration will inform the Israelis that they can have more U.S. planes . Not as many as they want-Premier Golda Meir has requested 25 U.S.-built Phantom jets and 100 Skyhawks-but some . There will be strings . The U.S. will probably continue to refuse to replace planes lost in actions against Lebanon or Jordan . It will also urge Israel to drop its demand for direct , unconditional talks with the Arabs and to indicate a readiness to part with at least some of the territory acquired during the Six-Day War . Even so , Arab reaction to the decision is bound to be severe . Libya is expected to sever diplomatic relations with the U.S. and may also crack down on U.S. oil companies operating there . Hostile demonstrations are certain to be staged against U.S. embassies , not to mention American diplomats , businessmen and possibly even tourists .                   @ @
