Short-track speed skating is a game full of explosive excitement . It also is a sports orphan , standing on the outside and looking in at the Olympics . The First World Short Track Speed Skating Competition last weekend at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana doubled as an audition for the International Skating Union , and when it was all over the future looked a bit brighter . Skaters from 10 nations had shown their stuff ; the ISU strongly indicated that it might adopt the sport ; and everybody left the rink figuring that , if it 's the Midwest today , tomorrow it 's the world . // But either way , for the spectators short-track skating is one of the better buys in sports . The speedsters blast off in packs , usually six to an event , circling a 100- to 125-meter rink when the races are staged indoors . And on the short and narrow courses , with the skaters bunched at speeds up to 30 mph , it gets scary . It is common to see a body come flying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice until it crashes into a wall . The result is something like a track event on blades , at distances from 250 to 3,000 meters , with just a dash of roller derby . Not that violence is condoned . After the start , where all the flailing bodies seem intent on merging into one , the policing is strict and one keeps his hands and elbows to himself . // Unlike speed skating in the Winter Olympics , where two skaters race independently against the clock on a 400-meter track , pack skating never leaves any doubt as to who is leading . Or , at the instant of crossing the finish line , who has won . Says Lars-Olaf Eklund , the Swedish captain , " Sometimes at the Olympics , when one skater has fallen and the other is a bad skater going 10,000 meters , it is quite easy to fall asleep . The word for it is boring . " // Boring was decidedly not the word for the relay races at the Illinois meet . A European innovation that at times resembles a demolition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,000 meters , most often with teams of four , and a skater can enter and leave a race as many times as he likes except on the final two laps . Usually a skater will go one lap  --  at Illinois that was 125 meters  --  before giving way . No batons are used . The fresh skater awaits his teammate as he comes boiling out of the last turn ; he is given a powerful two-handed push on the seat of the pants and goes roaring off . This means that for several seconds there are eight skaters on a very tiny stretch of the track : four of them taking off , four trying to get out of the way . To see it is to believe it . // Until The First World etc. , the Americans had never even witnessed a relay race . " We all thought it was a joke , " said Alan Rattray , a 20-year-old draftsman from Los Angeles and a two-time U.S. national champion . " I thought it was stupid and dangerous . But it really is a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one night of practice , and when we went out in the semifinal we were really smooth . " Smooth enough , as it turned out , to finish second to England in the 3,000-meter final . Then they got a whole lot smoother . All told , the U.S. took four of the five relays and , in fact , pretty much swept the meet , winning 20 of a possible 27 gold medals and 47 of 71 medals overall . But the joy of the competition was more meaningful than medal counts , a state of affairs personified by Australia 's Colin Coates , one of those who crashed into the boards and came up laughing . " Hey , that was fun , " he said . " Winning is fun ; losing is fun ; falling is fun . When any part of it stops being fun , you better get out . " // For years , getting out ( or converting to Olympic-style racing ) seemed to be about the only answer for those among the 2,000 registered U.S. speed skaters who wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available , indoors and out , the sport seemed to be facing a dead end . The events of last week may have changed all that . // " We are thinking of more than just the U.S. kids , " said Bill Markland , the meet director and one of the prime movers behind the competition . " We are talking to Saudi Arabia , to the South Africans , to Japan . We are saying : hey , you can compete . You do n't need those big 400-meter tracks that are so expensive . Build small rinks . For our sport that 's all you need . The Eastern bloc countries have dominated speed skating because they are the ones with all the big rinks . Short-track racing can turn that situation around . " // But it wo n't be easy . And Philip O. Krumm , the U.S. Olympic Committee president , figures it wo n't be soon . The short-track people would like to see their sport in the 1980 Winter Games . Krumm says there is a chance  --  but only as an exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sport . No way , " Krumm said as he watched the world competition . " It would be a great step forward just to get it on the program as an exhibition . So many sports are trying to get Olympic recognition . Tennis , baseball , some we never heard of . And there are rules about the number of countries participating in a sport before it can become an Olympic event . Of the 38 countries in the Winter Olympics , only half of them are involved in speed skating .... " He shrugged to complete the sentence . // Nonetheless , short-track skating is growing in popularity . Canada 's program is second only to that of the U.S. England 's and Australia 's are both strong . South Africa is holding competitions . Most of Europe is participating and other nations are taking a close look at the sport . // " In Sweden we have discovered going indoors is a way to make people skate , " said Eklund . " We have 75 400-meter rinks , but we have 500 indoor hockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe the ratio is 15 to 1 for the small rinks . And there is general public acceptance . The smaller rinks in the neighborhood make it not so far to go . It is better . We are starting from the bottom , building a good foundation . A lot of countries are doing that . Someday , when our little ones grow up , it will be a very popular sport . " // And , as the skaters hope , a real , live Olympic sport . As they said after The First World etc. , today Champaign , tomorrow champagne .
