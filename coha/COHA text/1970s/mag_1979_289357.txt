For malihinis and faithful whales , a last paradise in the sun <P> Long , long ago , legend has it , the demigod Maui became incensed with the sun . It passed too swiftly over his Hawaiian island , leaving little time for fruits to ripen or womenfolk to dry their tapa cloth . So , with a web of 16 ropes , Maui lassoed the sun . " Give me my life , " pleaded Sol . " I will , " replied the demigod , " if you promise to move more slowly across our sky . " The sun consented , and to this day , islanders swear , its arc is longer , its rays more generous than anywhere else on earth . And ever since , Maui 's mighty volcano has been known as Haleakala , House of the Sun . <P> Maui 's magic is as potent as ever , except that today he casts his net at the malihinis , the strangers from all over who swarm to his Valley Island by the thousands , bearing millions . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenario that , in mainlanders ' eyes at least , has become to Hawaii what Mickey Mouse is to Disney World or the one-armed bandit to Las Vegas . They come for some of the world 's most spectacular scenery and a variety of activities unmatched by any comparable area on earth . They come to sun , snorkel , scuba , skinny-dip , surf , sail and swim at 33 miles of superb public beaches ; to cruise the crystalline waters on glass-bottomed boat , catamaran , windjammer or outrigger canoe ; to golf , play tennis , deep-sea fish and surfcast ; to flight see by helicopter ; to beach-walk , backpack , camp , climb , ride horseback , bicycle , nature-walk , birdwatch , whale-gaze , explore , eat , drink , shop and be entertained , all on a 729-sq. - mi. isle about half the size of Long Island , N. Y. Largely pristine and un-Waikikied , it may be the last paradise with panache . <P> Maui , a tiny Rorschach splotch in the North Pacific , is pounded by breakers , caressed by potpourri-fragrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days a year of that still obedient sun . Maui is a microcosm of the world 's landscapes and climates . Temperatures range from subarctic to subtropic ; rainfall from 3 in. to 400 in. ( but this whiter the whole island was drenched with a near record rainfall ) ; the terrain from soaring peaks , impenetrable jungles and black lava promontories to viridian uplands , gossamer falls and beaches of bleached sand . <P> On the same 20 N. latitude line as Hong Kong , Mecca , Mexico City and Calcutta , Maui ( pop . 54,000 ) is the second biggest , second youngest ( some 15 million years old ) of the 132 islands of the 50th and southernmost state . Maui County attracts more visitors than any other of the islands ( 1,414,867 in 1978 , up 12.5% over the previous year ) . Oahu ( Waikiki Beach , Pearl Harbor ) is seriously overbuilt and overcrowded ; Hawaii ( " the Big Island " ) is famed for its volcanoes and rugged natural beauty but has few beaches and little action for the tourist ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lush interior but not much else ; Molokai also has superb beaches , but only one hotel and an arid interior .
