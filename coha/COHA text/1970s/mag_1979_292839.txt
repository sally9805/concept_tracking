If Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton , then .. <P> It was great-while it lasted . Sixteen seconds after the first game began , Guy Lafleur scored for the National Hockey League All-Stars against the Soviets ' national team in Madison Square Garden . The final score was 4-2 , and the honor and heritage of Canada and the U.S. were safe . But the Soviets rallied to win the second match , 5-4 , and then humiliated the N.H.L. in the rubber game , 6-0 . The debacle stirred musings about future showdowns with the Soviets in which national honor would be at stake : <P> The Soviets had scarcely finished wiping up Madison Square Garden with the N.H.L. capitalists when Pete Rozelle , czar of all he surveyed in pro football , was on the phone to the White House . " Beat them now , Mr. President , " he said , " and beat them big , or they 'll be muscling in everywhere-the U.S. Tennis Open , the America 's Cup , the jumping-frog contest in Calaveras County ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I want is a team that is as good and honest and true j as the American people . We got one ? " <P> " Sort of , " said Rozelle , and placed a call to the Kremlin . Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev came on the line . " You guys think you 're so tough , " said Pete , " how about a little game of football ? " <P> Brezhnev thought for a moment . <P> " This football , " he said , " it is like hockey without skates , right ? " <P> " Exactly , " said Rozelle . <P> " What about Tuesday ? " asked Brezhnev . <P> " Tuesday ? " <P> " Well , " said Brezhnev , " maybe we could get ready by Monday . I do n't know-we 've never played this football . " <P> Rozelle explained about the problem of selling deodorant and antifreeze ads on the tube for a hundred grand or so a half minute . " And you 've got to find some cheerleaders with cute belly buttons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brezhnev said he could see the wisdom of that . They settled on a date three months later in the Superdome . " A superduper game for the Superdome , " said Rozelle . " I like it , I like it , " said Brezhnev . <P> So the N.F.L. picked the very best players in the land and sequestered them for training in Palm Beach . Coach Tom Landry , chosen by the National Security Council , was so up for the game that he bought himself another of those little fedoras that make him look like a homicide detective , wise and tough . " The Soviets are n't ten feet tall , " he said . <P> Then the Soviets showed up . They were ten feet tall . The blue jeans that Rozelle gave them as a welcoming present came to their knees . But the visitors just laughed and said they were looking forward to playing against Too Short Jones . Landry told newsmen that the Soviets put their pants on one leg at a time .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
