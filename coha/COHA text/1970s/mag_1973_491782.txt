Tuesday , March 6 , was a MCC sunny day in Orlando , Florida , the only city in the hemisphere that harbored both Mickey Mouse and Harmon Killebrew . The twenty-six million tourists who visit the state each year all seemed to be converging on the town . Disney World was alive with cartoon heroes and kids . The racing cars were spinning at Sebring to the east . The fishing fleets were plying the Gulf of Mexico to the west . The lady jockeys were booting home winners in Miami to the south . And , on all sides , the baseball camps were rustling after a delayed start induced by rigidity of the " whereas " clause at the bargaining table . Over at the spring-training headquarters the Minnesota Twins were getting readyfor the first exhibition game of the season and everybody was talking idly about Willie Mays 's knees , Sparky Lyle 's ankle , Leo Durocher 's temper and Richie Allen 's salary . But before the afternoon was over , they would all be talking about a twentysix-year-old retreaded outfielder named Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneer in the most controversial experiment on the leisure-time scene . He was the first " designated hitter " of the baseball season . As the tenth man on a traditionally nine-man team , Hisle was n't sure that afternoon whether he was a pioneer or a guinea pig . He did know that he had had four shots at steady employment in the big leagues with the Philadelphia Phillies , for whom he once built a miniature batting average of .205 , and that he had been passed from Albuquerque to St. Louis to Minnesota without playing any games during the previous winter . He also knew that Manager Frank Quilici had " designated " him to bat for the Minnesota pitcher all afternoon , and so Hisle  --  a good " glove man " ? would spend his time marching from the bench to home plate without ever touching a glove . History had to wait a few minutes before Hisle made his debut as the " dh " in the box score because the other team was the Pittsburgh Pirates , who play in the National League . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League , which had voted in January to try the new rule for three years , except in interleague games : the World Series , the All-Star Game and exhibitions . So the Pirates put up a bigargument when Quilici offered the umpires a batting order with ten names . They finally subsided after the Minnesota management said it had advertised the experiment when selling tickets , grumbled that it would n't happen again and then watched Larry Hisle whack a home run with two men on base and another with the bases loaded . " it felt kind of weird sitting in the dugout while my teammates were on defense , " Hisle reflected later . " I do n't think I 'd like the job full time since I enjoy defense almost as much as hitting . I killed the time by studying the Pittsburgh pitchers and by drinking a lot of water at the cooler . " Maybe it was caused by the seven-hour day , the five-day week or the four-week vacation , to say nothing of the fact that earthmen these days stare at a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Zambia . But whatever the reason , the 1970 's came hustling into sight wrapped in dollar signs surrounded by people with the time and money to lavish on something called " the entertainment buck . " It took 200,000 of them to buy one minute of commercial time on the Super Bowl telecast ; 5,000,000 of them to syndicate a race horse , and 100,000,000 of them to build a stadium . It was a time when most ski-country families had two or more snowmobiles in the barn , when America added 300 golf courses a year and when the National Hockey League expanded overnight from six teams to twelve and then to fourteen . You could watch Hungarian soccer players kick field goals from the 50-yard line or North Carolina basketball players heave three-point baskets from 30 feet out . There were sixteen teams in two divisions in one hockey league and ten teams in two divisions in the competing league ; seventeen teams in four divisions in one basketball league plus ten teams in two divisions in another ; twenty-six teams in six divisions in two conferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions in two baseball leagues . And as for the public : bewildered and bewitched maybe , but free-spending definitely . " They 're really pouring it on , " The New York Times observed as things heated up . " When the little guy suddenly gets a little money , he spends it . " To make a long story short , when he started spending it on something else , the baseball people started looking around for ways to recapture his interest and his wallet . Then , when nine of the twelve clubs in the American League drew fewer than a million customers in 1972 , the stampede was on . The villain : the 6-foot-4-inch pitcher with overpowering stuff . The victim : the man waving a baseball bat 601/2 feet away . The reason , suggested Gabe Paul : " The pitchers and the stadiums grew too big . " Larry Hisle did n't realize it at the time , but that was his cue . Actually , the cue had been sneaking up on him . In 1895 , the infield fly rule was adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1901 , it was revised to protect the innocent . In 1920 , the spitball was outlawed . In 1950 , the strike zone was defined ( armpit to top of knee ) . In 1963 , it was defined again ( top of shoulder to bottom of knee ) . In 1969 , would you believe armpit to top of knee again ? Then men walked on the moon , the Mets won the pennant and the red-ink wretches of the American League began clamoring for somebody , anybody , to put more clout into the old ball game . Enter the tenth man : the " designated hitter . " He arrived in 1969 , during the same summer Neil Armstrong arrived on the shore of the Sea of Tranquility , but nobody paid much attention . Still , in places like Rochester and Syracuse and Toledo , he was often the talk of the town : the man who did nothing but bat for the pit cher , and Alexander Cartwright be damned . He was experimental that summer , his stage was the International League ( highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquility was immediate . Batting averages in the league promptly rose by as much as 17 points for the first-place club . More runs were scored . The designated hitters collectively batted 120 points higher than the pitchers they replaced . The pitchers  --  who were allowed to stay in the game strictly as pitchers began to stick around a lot longer . Few of them got to bat very often . And some of them  --  the eighth , ninth and tenth men on the staffs  --  did n't get to pitch very often , either . Also , since nothing takes so much time in a baseball game as changing the pitcher , the games zipped along : ten minutes shorter on the average . The fans , reported George Sister , the league president , " overwhelmingly liked it " when polled . One player named Jim Campbell spent the summer batting in the No. 9 spot inthe lineup for Rochester , hit .295 , drew admiring glances from the St. Louis Cardinals ( who were looking for a pinch-hitter ) and made the big leagues as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had kept Casey Stengel in chuckles on the chuckling Mets a decade earlier , came out of retirement for the occasion . Laying aside his paintbrushes in Florida , he revived his baseball career as the leadoff batter for the Tidewater Mets  --  since his contributions as a catcher had always been suspect , anyway  --  and had such a heady time that he charged the team only for his bus fare from Orlando to Norfolk . Hal King , a catcher for Louisville , could n't run or throw particularly  --  which was like having a quarterback who could n't pass particularly . But as the designated hitter , he batted .330 while Bob Montgomery handled the catching chores . And both then made the big leagues . Everything worked so well , in fact , that Tidewater sent only three pitchers to bat all season . As luck would have it , two got hits . Now it 's 1973 , and the mail is pouring in to the American League . Suppose , people wanted to know , the Minnesota club has a weak-hitting shortstop . Can Harmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experimenters answered patiently , he can swing only for the pitcher . Does that mean the " dh " must always hat ninth in the lineup , where the pitcher usually bats ? Not necessarily . Pitchers bat ninth most of the time because they 're usually the weakest hitters on the team . But theoretically , they may swing anywhere in the lineup  --  and so may their " designated hitters . " Q. -- Suppose the manager wants somebody else to bat for the designated hitter later in the game ; is that possible ? A. ? Yes , but then that man becomes the official " dh " in the batting order and the original hitter is out of the game . Q. ? Suppose Al Kaline is the designated hitter and , later in the game , Manager Billy Martin wants to use him in right field on defense . Legal or not ? A. ? It 's legal , but then Kaline becomes the right fielder and Detroit plays the rest of the game without a designated hitter . Q. ? Does this mean that in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be ten men in the lineup instead of nine ? A. ? No , the manager may elect to use the designated hitter on any given day or he may not . He has three choices : Start the game without a designated hitter and go the distance without one . Start with one and stick with him ( or his successors ) . Or , start with one , and then switch him to defense later in the game and revert to the old-fashioned rules . A fine mixed hag of mail it was , too . The Governor of Pennsylvania , Milton Shapp , advised the commissioner that the game needed some punch . An American college student in Nairobi , Kenya , penned a thirty-two-page handwritten letter reviewing the situation in the big leagues and suggesting changes . From a mission church at Fort Defiance , Arizona , a priest put it in scenario form : " Suppose one team starts a left-handed pitcher and the Continued on pane 127 designated hitter . Later in the game , the lefty is replaced by a right-handed pitcher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He enclosed two answer boxes to be checked off : one marked " yes , " the other " no . " And a stamped self-ad dressed envelope . Joe Garagiola , who did not hit in the big leagues , said it was an innovation and he was looking forward to it . Tony Kubek , who did hit in the big leagues , believed you 'd get more runs for your money but felt the rule would " take something out of the game , too . " Billy Martin said he had n't been in favor of it especially , but noted that his pitching staff had the worst collection of hitters in the league  --  they batted under .100 and struck out 50 percent of the time . Joe DiMaggio liked it , but doubted that the experiment would have prolonged his own career twenty years earlier . Mickey Mantle scoffed at himself as a " dh " and said : " If I could still hit , I 'd still be playing . " The Boston Red Sox tried to sneak a tenth man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game one day against the Philadelphia Phillies ( wrong league ) and , when the umpires blew the whistle , Manager Eddie Kasko raged : " We 've got a stupid rule that nobody wants to make a ruling on . " Cepeda , forced to pinch-hit once under the old rules , grounded out and the Phillies won . Two weeks later , in an unscheduled game against the Detroit Tigers , he hit an unscheduled home run and the Red Sox won . Anyway , everybody was talking about it  --  even yelling about it  --  and that was probably the idea in the first place . The point was that the tenth man was here in the nine-man sport . Not even the lonely end or the pulling guard rated such commotion . and strong men began to wonder what might have happened in the old days if ... well , if the tenth man had been around then . " It 's a shame the designated hit-ter was n't in when I was playing , " lamented Ralph Houk , manager of the Yankees , who got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of baseball . " Then somebody else would 've done more designated hitting and I would 've done more catching . " The beau ideal , people guessed , would have been Smokey Burgess , who set records for pinch-hitting with the Chicago White Sox . In his last couple of years , he did n't even own a catcher 's mitt , though that had been his trade , and as soon as he pinch-hit some days , he would skip the park and leave things to the nonspecialist troops . Or it might have been Johnny Mize , who did nothing but pinch-hit for the Yankees at the end of his career , Or Zeke Bonura , who did strange things at first base but not at home plate . Or Ernie Lombardi , the hulking catcher who never got an infield hit but who got plenty of outfield hits . Or Hack Wilson , who knocked in 190 runs one year . Or it might have been Jerry Lynch , who had all the qualifications : no glove but a home-run bat . lie was a menace to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other team in the hitter 's box . In the dim days before the designated hitter crept into the box scores of America , the Pittsburgh Pirates stationed Jerry Lynch in left field one day -- just after his manager , Fred Haney , had received a pregame plaque from the National Safety Council . Then the game started , fly balls began to cascade into left field , Lynch misjudged three in a row , people sitting in the bleachers scurried for cover and Haney finally pulled him out of the game , explaining : " 1 was afraid they 'd take the plaque away from me if 1 left him in there . " But not anymore . Wherever you may be , Jerry Lynch , come back  --  all is forgiven in this enlightened day of electronic computers , microphotography , lunar modules , sophisticated missiles , laser beams , floating dollars and the tenth man in the nine-man batting order .
