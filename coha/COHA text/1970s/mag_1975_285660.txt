In 1774 Louis XVI became King of France ; in 1830 , Charles X fell . The texture of French thought changed more radically in those 56 years than it ever had before , or would again . So did its cultural surface , especially in painting , which moved , as it were , from the pink thighs of Boucher 's Miss O'Murphy to the martial sinews of David 's Horatii and thence to the tumescent flesh of Delacroix 's slave girls almost within the lifetime of one man . Yet these tremendous years of the Revolution , the Directorate and the Empire have long been the art historian 's Bermuda Triangle . They are crudely charted with the routine marks " classical " and " romantic , " shoaled with contradiction , ready to sink almost any generalization . <P> It takes one great exhibition to open the subject afresh ; and now it has come , under the title " French Painting 1774-1830 : The Age of Revolution . " Jointly organized by France 's Runion des Muses Nationaux , the Detroit Institute of Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Grand Palais in Paris . In an abbreviated form ( 149 paintings out of the original 207 ) , it opened last week in Detroit , and will go to the Met in June . <P> Despite the cuts forced by the Met 's director , Thomas Hoving , the show remains a triumph of connoisseurship - one of the great museum events of the past 20 years . This is due in no small part to the detail . Rather than being a portmanteau of highlights , the exhibition includes an immense range of underrated " minor " figures like the neoclassicists Jean-Franois-Pierre Peyron and Jean Germain Drouais . The subject matter runs from the grandest of historical paintings to an eccentric still life with stuffed birds ; the figures , from a swooning and epicene Death of Hyacinth by Jean Broc to the passionate and despairing cragginess of Delacroix 's Christ in the Garden of Olives , 1827 ( see color page ) . <P> About Heroes . One fiction that the show destroys is the lingering idea that revolutions in politics produce revolutionary art styles . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood , grapeshot and equality is a myth . As the catalogue reminds us , " It is generally agreed that the Revolution did not seriously affect the development of French painting . " Thus when it came , the successful portraitists-most of whom , like the gifted Adlade Labille-Guiard , were women-simply turned from painting the court to recording the features of eminences like Robespierre and Talleyrand .
