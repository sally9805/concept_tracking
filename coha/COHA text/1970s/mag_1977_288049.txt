Tapping a lode worth billions <P> Buried beneath Australia 's remote , forbidding northern wilds is one-fifth of the world 's known reserves of uranium , but they have been of no use to atomic-power plants . The government , fearful that mining would damage the Australian environment and that exports might encourage nuclear proliferation , has forbidden exports since 1973 . Last week , however , Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser decided to permit mining companies to develop and export the mammoth lode . <P> Supplies have become so tight that prices-squeezed up by a cartel of producers-rose from $7 a pound in 1972 to around $42 at present . In the U.S. , Westinghouse Electric Corp . reneged on long-term contracts to supply utilities with " yellowcake " at fixed prices of $8 to $12 a pound , claiming that it would be ruined if it followed through . Now , utilities in the U.S. and elsewhere are delighted to have a new source of supply . On a loftier plane , Fraser said , " The advent of Australia as a major supplier of uranium will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of international affairs - nuclear weapons proliferation-will be heard . " <P> The Fraser administration has set the most stringent ecological standards governing safety , waste disposal and environmental protection . But when Fraser showed up at a dinner in Sydney , a mob of 3,000 protesters greeted him , some of them pelting him with bottles . <P> Four mining companies , led by Ranger , in which the Australian Atomic Energy Commission has a half interest , are geared up to go . At least one mine will be in full production by 1981 , with others following in short order . At current world prices , the lode is worth an estimated $35 billion . As one Wall Street analyst , Andrew Racz , of Philips , Appel and Walden Inc. , says : " Uranium could be to Australia what oil is to Saudi Arabia . "
