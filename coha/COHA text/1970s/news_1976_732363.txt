txt The era of supersonic air travel , ushered into the United States Feb. 4 by Transportation Secretary William T. Coleman Jr. , still faces rough flying weather . Despite receiving precisely what they wanted ? two flights each daily into New York and one each-daily into Washington  --  the British and French operators of the Concorde supersonic jetliner confront these legal and economic storm clouds : ? Possible New York ban : State and local officials may yet bar the Concorde from John F. Kennedy Airport , which unlike Dulles airport in Washington is not federally owned and operated . JFK is run by the Port of New York-New Jersey Port Authority whose aviation officials have indicated opposition to allowing the plane into the heavily populated airport area . New York Gov . Hugh Carey testified before Secretary Coleman in January that the Concorde should . be banned ; New Jersey G ? v. Brendan Byrne expressed concern some weeks ago and has asked his staff for an evaluation . " The situation with respect , to JFK may be complicated , " Secretary Coleman conceded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitherto prevailed a local airport proprietor has had authority . . . to refuse landing rights . " A New York ban would deprive the Coneorde of its most lucrative passenger market . The British and French airlines now fly five regular jet flights daily in winter and eight in summer into JFK , but do not serve Washington on even a daily basis . ? Noise rules . The Environmental Protection Agency has already revised its air-noise standards ( to aircraft flying after the start of 1975 ) specifically to cover Concorde ? whose arrival here it opposes . The agency . recommends standards to the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) , which is obligated only to hold a hearing on the // * Concorde green light leads to new storms // recommendation . It may be rejected , but a hearing would impose another potential delay and more public debate on the issue . ? Lawsuits . Environmentalists concerned about the plane 's noise , noxious emissions , and possible damage to the earth 's protective ozone layers threaten lawsuits which could shut out the aircraft for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Environmental Defense Fund . ? Congressional intervention . The House of Representatives already has banned the Concorde from JFK until mid-June , and the Senate is being asked for an even broader ban on both airports . A Senate committee is to act Feb. 5 . ? Trial period . The plane ? twice as fast but twice as noisy as conventional craft ? must prove itself in a 16-month trial period . Its noise and pollution levels will undergo rigorous monitoring during the probation period by the FAA . In his booklet-sized 32-page decision , Mr. Coleman concluded that the Concorde " complies with all applicable United States safety requirements " and is a " technological innovation " which must be welcomed . He said his decision was not dictated by international treaty or domestic law , but " the rules of fair competition . " The environmental impact on American climate is termed " clearly insignificant " and noise problem " small . " The Transportation Secretary leaves the door open for an expanded Concorde flight schedule in the future . " I would . . . be blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion of operations if supersonic transports become commercially successful and environmentally acceptable , " he said . He called 25 flights a day to New York and five to Washington " the likely maximum . " But any additional flights would require a new environmental study and clearance . The Concorde will halve the transatlantic flight time between London and New York from seven hours , 50 minutes , to three hours 50 minutes , and between London and Washing ton from eight hours , 45 minutes to four hours . The fare , tailored to businessmen , is expected to be 15-20 percent above present first-class tickets . The remaining barriers to full Concorde service leave the project 's economic future in doubt . The British and French have sunk an admitted $2.2 billion and perhaps as much as $4 billion into the 14-year project ? a 400 percent cost overrun . The only purchasers so far of the $60 million plane are British and French state airlines . The probationary approval for American service may revive the interest of other airlines .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
