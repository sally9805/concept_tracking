The lights come up on JORY 'S livingroom . It is filled with flowers in funeral arrangements and plates of fancy cakes . JORY sits very still in a chair . WIN is trying to look on the bright side . VICKY takes nothing lightly . WIN They will want to know what she 's going to do about the flowers . VICKY They can keep them at the church . WIN Well , they wo n't want them all at the church . VICKY Why not ? WIN It 's a church , Vicky . It is n't blossom time and gypsy magic . VICKY Well , Jory wo n't want them back here . WIN That 's why they 'll want to know what to do with them . VICKY What do they usually do ? WIN They ask the family , as I said . VICKY And what does the family usually do ? WIN They give them to hospitals and so on . VICKY Then Jory will do that . WIN Which hospital ? p. 3 VICKY Who cares which hospital ? WIN There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are hospitals which are n't deserving ? WIN How many hospitals need a rather garish blanket of roses that says M.P . South Saskatchewan ? VICKY No one wants those roses , Win . Why talk about those roses ? WIN I think Jory should decide . VICKY I think you should leave Jory alone . WIN Perhaps the hospital where Howard . . . ( WIN mouths the word " died " . VICKY does n't want to think about the word " died " . ) VICKY All right ! That hospital ! . WIN But they ca n't take them all . VICKY Why not ? WIN It 's a very small hospital . It is n't a funeral home . VICKY I 'm glad Jory did n't hear that .

WIN Jory dear ! I suppose you think I talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much . Whenever he gets the chance to interrupt , which is n't often . But what no one seems to realize is that I know I talk too much . I 'm not a complete fool . I do see that people stand around with mouth agape when I begin . I talk too much because I love you , Jory . I want to take your mind off your troubles . VICKY Why ? WIN Why what ? VICKY Why do you want to take her mind off her troubles ? WIN Because she 's my friend . VICKY Perhaps she would rather you left her alone . WIN Why ? VICKY Perhaps she 'd like to be alone . WIN Well , you can leave her alone if you like , and I 'll stay here and cheer her up . ( CALLA enters with a plate of teacakes ) CALLA Are there any more of Mrs. Winrobe 's teacakes ? VICKY This is Howard 's funeral . Jory 's husband 's funeral . I do n't want to cheer up . I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . VICKY And Jory is sad . WIN Jory is catatonic .

VICKY You think I 'd invade Jory 's privacy . . . take advantage of our friendship . WIN You 're a journalist , Vicky . You write for the newspapers . VICKY I wrote a tribute to Howard . WIN You 're the only person in the world could make driving a car into the Saskatchewan River sound like an heroic act . ( To CALLA ) It 's because Vicky and Howrrd were old friends . Howard was fifteen and Vicky was twelve . They used to Indian wrestle . VICKY Howard was my M.P . ( The telephone rings ) WIN Hello . . . No , she is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

WIN ( As cheery as ever ) Maybe Jory would like a teacake . VICKY ( Taking the place from WIN ) No , she would n't . WIN ( Taking the plate from VICKY ) We have to keep our strength up . VICKY The next thing you know , you 'll be hotting up casserole dinners and telling us life goes on . WIN ( Eating a cake ) Life does go on . VICKY The point is , it does n't . WIN I 'm sorry Jory had to hear that . p. 8 VICKY ( Regret ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what she does say is always unfortunate . VICKY ( To JORY ) I did n't mean . . . I 'm sorry . WIN The first time we lost Jory was just after her first anniversary . I talked about my hairdresser . I spent five days babbling about all the things he knew for sure and she never said a word . She made me so nervous . I 've never been able to think of anything to say to people who do n't talk back . " Keep Smiling " seems inadequate . VICKY ( To JORY ) I loved Howard . I loved you and Howard . WIN And last time , three years ago , just after Howard ran for Parliament . Jory was just like she is now , looking three feet over my left shoulder . We had all that Scotch and I talked about the children and bilingualism . Why do n't you talk this time , Vicky ? What about your wedding ? How soon do we see your soon-to-be ? VICKY What is a " soon-to-be " ? WIN Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jory would like a drink . Good , she has grenadine and that 's a cheerful colour . ( WIN begins to mix a large , very strong drink ) p. 9 VICKY " Soon-to-be " . . . God . WIN Frankly Vicky , I do n't know how long I 'll last with her this time around , because emotional excess is one thing , but mental illness drives me crazy . I have to remind myself I could never abandon a troubled fellow creature who needed any creature comfort . How would I feel if I dropped by tomorrow morning to find Jory with her head in a gas oven , her stomach full of sleeping pills , the phone that was n't answered , only inches away . ( JORY will not drink WIN 'S drink . WIN drinks it herself ) VICKY How is it that you find my conversation tasteless ? ( CALLA enters ) CALLA Are there any more of Mrs. Galen 's date squares ?

VICKY Do you think I want to do a photo essay for the Life Style Section ? WIN I hope not . VICKY You think just because I 'm going to marry Arthur and he 's the one who got me into MacLeans , you think I have to prove myself . You think I 'm worried about my work . You think I 'm going to write a Canadian Gothic mood piece about Jory 's suffering , Jory 's pain . I do n't even know this . . . photographer . What 's his name ? CALLA Max . VICKY He may not have film in his camera . CALLA He says to get your ass out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VICKY ( Exit ) Did he tell you he was married ? He is n't married . ( CALLA and WIN wonder if VICKY will manage her re-entry as well as her exit ) CALLA Why is Mrs. Winrobe wearing that long white dress ? WIN It 's her chapter dress . Canadian Daughters League . p. 12 CALLA She looks like a pillow . WIN All those League ladies loved Howard . I guess it was his position on the Queen . ( Enter VICKY ) VICKY It 's only that I think Jory is too . . . withdrawn . CALLA She 's catatonic . VICKY She should talk about her troubles . . . WIN To the Lifestyle Section ? VICKY She should make a public statement . Howard was a public figure . Just a few words . It would help to keep her mind off things . It would help her . . . you know . . . to forget . . . WIN Are you writing some kind of Harlequin Romance ? VICKY We all care about Jory , do n't we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best we can , I guess . VICKY I 'm trying to help Jory . I do n't write anything that could hurt her or embarrass her in any way . I do n't print any of those silly rumours , do I ? CALLA Not even the rumour that your mother started . VICKY My mother was only trying to help . p. 13 CALLA She said Howard 's death was part of a plot . An extremist plot . VICKY I suppose you 'd rather listen to May Winrobe . Who said Howard had been drinking . . . you know . . . that night . WIN He had been drinking , Vicky . CALLA Or extremists drowned him in Seagrams V.O. VICKY Howard rarely drank . ( We know this is not true from the way JORY falls from her chair ) CALLA Extremists forged his name to bar bills all across the country . ( The telephone rings and WIN answers it ) WIN Hello . . . wrong number . ( She hangs up ) CALLA That was Andy was n't it ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with Jory ? CALLA Do n't change the subject , Win . VICKY I knew you should n't rock her back and forth . She hates being rocked . WIN Maybe we should get her some warm milk . p. 14 VICKY She does n't need warm milk . WIN And I can give her a pink pill . VICKY She needs company . WIN She needs to be alone . CALLA I 'll take my own phone calls . I 'll tell Andy when I 'm out . WIN She looks tired . VICKY She wo n't sleep . WIN With warm milk , she will sleep . VICKY She hates warm milk . WIN She likes hot chocolate . VICKY I am not going to talk about bedtime drinks . CALLA ( To WIN ) What if it were a business call ? I did run Howard 's office . WIN Andy does not think of you as business-like . VICKY I am not going to talk about who will talk to Andy on the phone . WIN Andy and I are married , Vicky . CALLA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 WIN ( About JORY ) I think we should keep talking . I think I saw her twitch . VICKY I do n't know what to say . WIN ( Bright . For JORY 'S benefit ) Where is Arthur ? VICKY What difference does that make ? WIN ( Sotto voce ) If you could chat a little . About Arthur . If you did n't look so dreary , Vicky . VICKY Arthur is working . WIN ( Sotto voce ) Smile . VICKY Arthur is researching a story . WIN Oh ! What kind of story ? VICKY He is in Ethiopia . WIN Is that the place to be ? VICKY ( Sotto voce ) You are heartless , Win . WIN Arthur is a trend setter , I believe . He never does anything but the top ten things to do . Which explains why he could n't make the funeral . Is Arthur what they call a political analyst , I wonder ? Of course a political analyst does n't need to spend much time in Saskatchewan . If you 've heard one joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all . ( As VICKY says nothing ) p. 16 WIN Why wo n't you talk about Arthur ? What do you want to talk about ? Shall we pay our respects to the dead ? VICKY ( Sotto voce ) This is a funeral , Win . That is all I want to say . WIN Good old Howard . VICKY You are n't going to talk about Howard ? WIN I guess the first thing about Howard was he was such a smart son-of-a-bitch . VICKY Win , you do n't seem to realize . . . WIN A lot of people said he was arrogant , but I never thought he was arrogant , even though he must have been just about the smartest thing to come riding out of south Saskatchewan . . . like riding out of the sunrise . . . Howard always let you think he 'd been riding all night . . . Well , I never thought I 'd say it , but I 'll miss the bastard . VICKY ( Sotto voce ) There are things we should talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all I want to say . WIN It 's Howard 's funeral and we should talk about Howard . Look how narrow his ties were . His cream-coloured Western suit , his big brown hat , his boots . It was not an original effect , of course , but there is nothing wrong with imitation if it works . The first time Ross Thatcher saw Howard , that 's exactly what he said . p. 17 VICKY Howard looked so friendly and dependable . WIN That 's why your mother voted for him , Vicky . . . It 's lucky Andy never had to run for office . His ties are too wide . VICKY I 'm worried , Win . WIN Well , so am I , god damn it . ( CALLA enters with another plate to refill ) CALLA Mrs. Godwin wonders why Howard 's coffin was closed . WIN Mrs. Godwin is the one who made the brownies . VICKY Mrs. Godwin wanted Howard propped up in a corner with a plate of cakes . WIN She wanted the coffin open .

He and Andy , Jesus . p. 18 CALLA Frank Rosie is here . From the riding association . ( They all study JORY who is curled into a ball ) VICKY I do n't think she can talk to anyone right now . WIN Not unless we roll her out to meet them . VICKY Do n't joke , Win . WIN Tell him Jory is distrait . CALLA ( To JORY ) The riding association wants to try to tell you what Howard meant to South Saskatchewan . WIN And all of it called Winter Works . VICKY Everyone in this riding respected Howard .

VICKY Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them close enough to see he was laughing his smart little ass off . VICKY Howard was a public servant ! WIN Do n't exaggerate . VICKY Howard worked for us .

CALLA Am I the only person who gets phone calls in this house ? Is Andy the only one who ever calls . WIN It 's nine o'clock . He calls at nine o'clock . Go ahead . Talk to him .

I 'm trying to help Jory . WIN I think that telephone will drive me mad . ( Everyone waits until the telephone stops ringing . Nobody moves ) ( Finally ) These bath buns are awfully good . p. 20 VICKY I 'm not eating bath buns . WIN Frank Rosie is single , Calla . CALLA That 's why I did n't like him . I thought it was because his palms were sweaty . WIN He 's worried . Howard was not John Diefenbaker as every old lady in the next room will be able to tell you . But as your own mother once said , Vicky , at least Howard was a prairie boy and you could tell he was as smart as paint and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he never said anything but freight rates . Now what is Frank going to do ? The Liberals ca n't win in South Saskatchewan . Not since the potash plant . CALLA Frank wants Jory to run . VICKY Who ? WIN Who ? Jory ? VICKY Jory ? Why ? CALLA He wants her to take Howard 's seat . WIN He would . VICKY That 's wonderful . CALLA It 's stupid . WIN It 's the kind of thing the NDP do very well . VICKY Because she 's a woman ? She ca n't be a candidate because she 's a woman ? p. 21 CALLA Whoever Frank Rosie runs in this election will have to run through a hell of a lot of mud . WIN Until people stop talking about payoffs and kickbacks . . . VICKY Howard did not take graft . WIN Until egg lobby is not a dirty word . . . JORY There are men like the pirates of days of old Who murder and cheat for yellow gold Seduce the people right out of their socks With their taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind or foolish or deaf You will cast your vote for the C.C.F. VICKY Jory ! WIN Jory ! VICKY She 's all right . She 's talking . She 's going to run for Parliament . WIN Oh no she is n't . VICKY Jory ? You are all right , are n't you ?

VICKY What is wrong with Jory 's poem ? p. 22 WIN You have the literary pretensions , Vicky . VICKY The poem is spirited . WIN Frank Rosie is a Liberal , but he will be able to tell you that the last two lines of Jory 's poem are sadly out of place in a Liberal campaign , as well as being badly out of date . JORY So unless you ca n't hear or do n't think or ca n't see you will cast your vote for the N. D. P. WIN The N. D. P. wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Winter Works programme .

She hates politics . JORY I campaigned for Howard . WIN And he never let you say anything he would n't say himself . Jory on the campaign trail . For all the people of South Saskatchewan know , you are in favour of clean teeth and motherhood , but we know better , do n't we ? p. 23 CALLA You 're too radical , Jory . JORY I 'm nationalistic . CALLA South Saskatchewan is not ready for that . JORY What you need along the South Saskatchewan is a lot of talk about freight rates and the conspiracy on Bay Street and the beauty of the Northern Lights and the majesty of the plains and how they can screw the bastards from the East . . . WIN That is n't your style . Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you could n't keep a straight face . Forget about politics . Resign yourself to a quiet life . Help Vicky with her wedding plans . . .

JORY But when he went to Ottawa , they courted him . Poor Howard . WIN Vicky 's mother thought he was a statesman . She saw her meat loaf served at diplomatic dinners . JORY Howard always believed everything he told you so when they told him he was special , he was beautiful , he thought it was true . There were P.R . guys who called him baby . At the egg lobby . At the wheat prices review board . He was a pushover . Of course he got screwed . Just like Vicky and I in the back seat of Howard 's old car . VICKY I hope you do n't think that Howard . . . that I would ever . . . WIN Poor Howard . That 's what happened to Howard . That 's why you 're going back to Ottawa to join my yoga class . . . p. 25 JORY You remember when Howard made his first speech in the House ?

WIN Howard did not take graft because he was gullible . . . VICKY He did not take graft at all and no one believes that story , Jory . JORY ( To WIN ) Whatever he did , you stayed home and wound wool and found new ways to serve Kraft cheese while he did it . CALLA Mrs. Galen put Kraft cheese on her nut bread .

CALLA Win likes to stay home with her children . She keeps having children so she can talk about bunnies and puppies and ducks , It helps her stay young . JORY I ca n't stay home with your children , Win . They 're too sweet . I hate people who never do anything worse than eat dog food . WIN That was a cruel thing to say . JORY Will you work on my campaign ? WIN Of course I know there is more to life than having children . CALLA But she tries to avoid it as much as possible . p. 27 WIN I have a very full life .

You could never believe a word he said . Howard and his goddamn subsidies for butter . VICKY Jory wants subsidies for butter , do n't you , Jory ? WIN What could be more courageous , but essentially dull than a young widow carrying on her husband 's work ? It 's inspirational . It 's inoffensive . That 's what Liberalism is all about . JORY I ca n't sit home and feel morally superior to Howard . WIN Why not ? JORY I do n't know what I am . So why am I so sure of Howard ? WIN You 're crazy , Jory . VICKY Sshhhh !

I think that was her only distinction . VICKY ( Dancing around ) I am so excited , Jory . I am so excited . I am so excited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In spite of what his wife said .

He loves me . . . ( CALLA is working on a chrysanthemum and everyone realizes this may take a while ) VICKY There are three kinds of women . There are those you can depend on . Like Calla . Mothers . Always ready to give help and shelter . And there are those who are always looking for help and shelter . Like you , Win . And there 's Jory. . . somewhere beyond the stereo-type . . . WIN Jory and Vicky . p. 35 VICKY That 's right . WIN I do n't know how to describe you , Vicky . VICKY I am a person . WIN Oh . VICKY I love women . I love you , Win . WIN And I love you , Vicky . VICKY Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you love Howard . . . VICKY Ssshhh ! WIN Why should I sshhhh ? VICKY Howard was my M.P . WIN I love you for your fine imagination . VICKY No one believes those vicious rumours about me and Howard . People will say anything , of course . People say that Howard was dishonest . . . JORY Howard was a lawyer and he never did anything there were laws against . Not exactly . But his conscience used to trouble him . He used to grind his teeth in his sleep . He used to have sharp pains in his chest around his heart . And of course he used to drink a lot of Scotch . It never seemed to bother me , somehow . I think I got a great deal of comfort from thinking I was finer than Howard . More honest , more sensitive , all in all a better person . And of course I pretended that I did n't know . Howard liked me to pretend I did n't know . He wanted to protect me from the world . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could keep all the things he wanted to believe and polish them and protect them and have them shiny and safe whenever he needed them . Whenever he wanted to stop driving that car he did n't pay for . p. 36 VICKY Howard paid for his car . JORY No , he did n't , Vicky . VICKY Do you think Howard was some kind of crook ? JORY Everything is easy for you . Everything is right or wrong or true or false . So how can it be that your friend Jory lived with a man she knew to be unscrupulous ? VICKY You believed them ! JORY Vicky , I told them . VICKY Where is your loyalty ? JORY We all knew Howard , Vicky . . . VICKY What did you think when you found us in the locker room ? You believed those stories too , I guess . He was helping me with the pep rally , Jory . It was all choreography . My forward roll . CALLA He loves me . He loves me not . He loves me . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who are we for . Let 's all roar for . . . Howard ! WIN Now look what you 've done . JORY Will you work on my campaign ? Will you Win ? For friendship ? WIN You 're crazy , Jory. p. 37 JORY M.P . I 'm in politics . ( The telephone rings . JORY answers it ) Hello . . . Yes , I 'm the Independent candidate . ( She hangs up ) WIN What was that ? JORY An obscene phone call . WIN That 's wonderful . You 're going to Parliament . You can take off your hat at garden parties and you do n't have to curtsy anymore . Because M.P . ' s bow , I think , except for the Queen , meeting the Queen , when the Queen comes , which , God knows , is often enough for all but the most purse-mouthed monarchist from South Saskatchewan . It 's exciting , is n't it ? Perhaps it calls for a small celebration . Why do n't we sit down with the teacakes and the date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crispie marshmallow honey fudge coconut banana cream caramel delights . Then Jory will tell us why she wants to burn on Howard 's grave . VICKY Two . Four . Six . Eight . Who 's the man we think is great ? Who do we appreciate ? It 's Howard . CALLA He loves me . He loves me not . He loves me . He loves me not . WIN I need a long rest . Or a client centered therapist . Or a new combination of uppers and downers . You know , for the longest time , I used to empty all my prescriptions into a big bowl I kept beside the bed . Then every morning , before I woke up and knew what I was doing , I 'd reach into the bowl and choose one at random . The old bowl game , I called it . You should try the bowl game , Jory , if you think you 'll have any trouble at all getting through the next few days . Not to make a habit of it , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose that popping pills is an anti-social act , but it can also be a significant experience . I used to do it all the time , before I discovered primal therapy . ( WIN essays a primal scream . It is directed at JORY out of a sense of deep frustration . VICKY escalates her cheering and CALLA continues her dance of the flowers , scattering petals over WIN . A formidable looking lady appears at the door . She is older than the others - in fact , she is VICKY 'S mother . Perhaps because she is of a different generation , she is in much deeper mourning than the other women - even JORY . She has come from outside , so she must be in several layers of heavy mourning , which she proceeds to peel off ) p. 38 LUEL A house of death is a house of madness . WIN Hello , Auntie Luel . JORY It 's your mother , Vicky . VICKY Shake your leg . Shake your can . Vote for Howard . He 's your man . LUEL Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With her memories . Her aura has changed colour . . . Jory , I felt particularly close to Howard this morning . . . LUEL Cont 'd ( LUEL is speaking to CALLA who has stopped ripping flowers to watch LUEL warily ) I am sensitive to presence as you know . Perhaps if you and I joined hands , it might give you comfort . WIN That is n't Jory , Auntie Luel . Your veiling is too thick . JORY ( LUEL rhymes with " gruel " ) I 'm over here , Auntie Luel . WIN We were practicing for Calla 's wedding . LUEL You mean Vicky 's wedding . VICKY He 's the best , yes , he 's the King . Watch that Student Council swing . LUEL Vicky is the bride , girls .

JORY That was Vicky 's idea ? The great debate on cable television ? Vicky does not work on my campaign . . . Vicky should be confined . . . WIN She 's the only person in South Saskatchewan who knows you 're campaigning . ( The telephone rings ) Except for the obscene phone callers . ( She answers the phone ) Hello .

Then we heard about the Avon Lady seminar in Regina and Win persuaded her she should audit the lectures in promotional methods . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breathe heavily . p. 41 CALLA ( Enters ) He 's the one with no imagination . JORY But Vicky missed the bus to Regina . Now all she does is make speeches about me . CALLA What does it mean to be a Canadian Woman . Did you hear that speech ? ( JORY screams into the telephone and slams it down ) WIN A person who expects to lead her country for the next four years should have no trouble firing her campaign manager . JORY I have fired her . Forty-two times . CALLA At least she cares about your election . WIN The only other real enthusiasts want you dressed up in black boots and bunny ears . ( The telephone rings ) Do n't answer that . JORY He has a right to talk to his M.P . WIN He does n't want to talk to you . He made that perfectly clear . CALLA ( To the telephone ) Hello . . .

JORY Vicky has already read the speech . On the radio . WIN On the CBC . So nobody need ever know . CALLA ( Reads ) What does it mean to be Canadian ? Ask Marjorie . A little girl in brown stockings growing up in Saskatchewan . Brown stockings , a long red scarf and a coat with a hood . Her cheeks as red as the maple leaf each autumn . A Canadian girl in a white middy blouse , soon to be a Canadian woman . But what is a Canadian woman ? Legend tells us that when frightened , the Canadian beaver bites off his testicles and presents them to the enemy on his broad flat tail . What does that mean to the Canadian woman ? WIN Before she met Arthur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star-Phoenix . ( CALLA hangs up ) p. 43 CALLA She 's going to use that at her chapter meeting . For her study group . They 're going to study beaver balls . WIN I blame Arthur . A foreign correspondent in Saskatchewan . Of course he turned her head . Before Arthur she never wrote about anything more poetic than the mill rate . CALLA What was a foreign correspondent doing in Saskatchewan ? JORY I think his plane was shot down . WIN Vicky is too sensitive . VICKY ( Enters . To JORY ) You 're supposed to be at the telethon ! JORY That was not a telethon . There was a clock and a thermometer and a dial with the barometiic pressure . And me . I had to sit in front of the ad for the drive-in movie . VICKY You 're supposed to be there . At the studio . JORY I 'm not . VICKY Why not ? JORY People watch that channel to find out what time it is , Vicky . When they saw me , it seemed to annoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44 CALLA The first call was someone who said " Get out of South Saskatchewan . Just get out " . WIN It sounded like your mother , Vicky . CALLA Then no one called for seven minutes . JORY And I started getting sleepy . CALLA Then I called to ask a question about freight rates . JORY And I walked out . VICKY You walked out ? Of a hotline TV show ? JORY And I tried not to wake up the crew . VICKY What did they do when you left ? What 's going on ? JORY I do n't know . VICKY ( Horror ) Dead air ? JORY I do n't care what kind of air , Vicky . I will not spend four hours staring at a telephone . VICKY I should have screened the calls . JORY There were no calls . VICKY ( Falsely ) Ha . Ha .

I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You can read it for her too . On the CBC . VICKY Did you hear my speech ? The network picked it up , you know . It was broadcast right across the country . WIN That carries regional development far too far . VICKY There was a lot of audience response . CALLA That means someone in Dartmouth phoned the station . VICKY Really ? CALLA She said it was like the time they read the Pauline Johnson poems . JORY I 'm not running in Dartmouth . VICKY And someone in Bella Coola called . A girl I knew in school . JORY It 's lucky , Vicky . That you live in Canada . WIN Nowhere else in the world needs so little excuse for a radio talk . JORY Vicky is discovering our national identity . p. 46 VICKY It was good , was n't it ? " Growing up in Saskatchewan " . You liked the way I described you . In your winter coat .

VICKY I have everyone in Saskatchewan talking about you . JORY Have you heard what they 're saying ? " Who 's she ? " That 's what they 're saying . VICKY You 're too important now . It 's time to step all over your old friends . You want someone like Arthur on PR is n't that right ? JORY No , Vicky . VICKY I may not be able to write as well as your friends in Ottawa . I may not be able to run a campaign like a professional from Ontario . But I know Saskatchewan . I have lived here all my life . p. 47 JORY I know Saskatchewan , Vicky . VICKY You are from the East .

JORY What has happened here in the last six years that you know so much about and I do n't ? WIN Nothing . CALLA Nothing happens in Saskatchewan . I think that 's the point . VICKY ( Accusing ) That was a joke . Was n't it ? JORY Please , Vicky . . . VICKY People from the East . . . WIN We grew up together , Vicky . VICKY People from the East always think nothing happens in Saskatchewan . Easterners never seem very alive somehow . They are too sophisticated to notice things like the passing of the seasons . JORY I do n't care about the passing of the seasons . p. 48 VICKY That 's what I said . JORY I do n't care to listen to your poems about my old winter coat , no matter what you friends in Bella Coola think . . .

JORY I do n't want your surprise , Vicky . ( VICKY hangs up , non-plussed ) VICKY I think we 've reached the men in this campaign . I think we should start on the women . JORY Why do n't you write leaders for the Leader Post ? VICKY ( Incredulous ) The Regina Leader Post ? WIN Arthur does n't read the Leader Post . p. 49 VICKY I do n't care about Arthur . You think I 'm working for Jory so Arthur will see that Addis Ababa is not the only place in the world . Do n't you ? That is so untrue . I am trying to help , Jory . WIN Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will help you , Jory . In spite of Win 's jokes . CALLA What about your wedding ? You 'll want to spend some time on your wedding plans , Vicky . VICKY I do n't care about my wedding . I do n't care to spend my time going to trousseau teas and watching pop-up toasters come out of boxes . I care about my work . I care about Jory 's work . She 's going to change the world . WIN Everyone wants to change the world , Vicky . Even your mother . JORY Your mother takes night courses . Community law and macrame . VICKY Win makes a joke of everything . Win does n't seem to understand that some things are serious . There is nothing funny about my writing or my mother .

( " Went to Montreal " is fraught with meaning ) WIN What is wrong with going to Montreal ? LUEL Of course nothing is wrong with travel in Quebec and there are many reasons for doing so . I hold there is nothing wrong with learning French , for example . J'ai une armoire , Win . WIN Quelle jolie armoire , Aunt Luel . LUEL But was Jory in Quebec or did " it " happen in Ontario , since we all know that Jory 's French is bad . . . ? VICKY Did " what " happen in Ontario ? WIN No one minds that you French is bad , Jory . That would not be an issue in the ordinary way . VICKY Did " what " happen in Ontario ? p. 52 LUEL It 's only that Bill Kelleher owns the Aloha Maples Motor Inn . VICKY Did " what " happen in Ontario ?

Even when they ask how it is that Jory and Howard did not have children . . . VICKY That is such a stupid story , Mother . LUEL Jory and Howard did not want children , May and I reply . It 's the perfect response . p. 53 VICKY Bill Kelleher would say anything . He might have said Howard took me to his sleazy motel . LUEL But you explained that , Vicky . To the student discipline committee . WIN Even though the school band never toured again . VICKY There are many reasons for stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all right , Vicky . VICKY Is that why you do n't want me to work on your campaign ? JORY No , Vicky . VICKY There was nothing between me and Howard . People say anything , they say Howard did n't pay for his car . . . LUEL Extremists , dear . VICKY Oh yes , it 's easy to say that I was easy , but Jory knows the truth . . . JORY Everything was easy for Howard . VICKY Do you think I was that drunk ? JORY You did n't have to be drunk . I was never drunk . VICKY Do you think I would betray Jory 's friendship ? Jory 's trust ? I love you , Jory . I loved you and Howard . . . p. 54 LUEL Vicky was very fond of Howard when she was a girl . Until he married you , Jory . Then she never thought of him again , except when she cast her ballot , of course . VICKY . . . that 's why I 'm working so hard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper . . . JORY What pancake supper ? VICKY To raise money . For your campaign . I 've invited community leaders . LUEL May Winrobe is coming . VICKY I 've invited twenty-five people .

WIN In three days , everyone in South Saskatchewan will be eating pancakes . VICKY Look , here 's the sourdough batter . JORY I have indigestion . ( All the ingredients for the pancake supper may be pre-set on a table or VICKY may have wheeled them in on a serving trolley or she may be running back and forth to the kitchen at this very moment ) VICKY Here 's Fay Galen 's mock maple syrup. p. 55 LUEL That is not Fay 's mock maple syrup . VICKY Here are the strawberry preserves . LUEL Fay 's recipe is secret . VICKY Here are the sausages . LUEL Fay would not use her maple syrup for political ends .

LUEL Because we 're going to have a wedding shower . Chop Chop girls . Calla , there are streamers you can hang and this will be Vicky 's chair . . . CALLA I wish we could have a wedding shower . LUEL Your wish is granted , dear . CALLA Vicky 's having a pancake supper . Here 's the sourdough batter . LUEL Of course you can not have a pancake supper with real maple syrup because no one could afford to eat the pancakes , that is why Fay 's syrup is so in demand and you do not have Fay 's syrup. . . p. 57 WIN We ca n't have a shower . Vicky is n't here . LUEL ( Loudly ) Shhhh ! This is all a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a shower is in the surprise . CALLA I love showers . I love weddings .

Fundamentalist religion and a macrobiotic diet . I mean , he was , for a time , a convert to both Bahai and Scientology .

He did one night stands all over Saskatchewan . He began to hate the colour of the whites of his eyes . He lived on booze and pills and health foods . WIN You 're a comfort , Calla . To the weak and lost . CALLA Thank you . WIN The weak and lost are always men . CALLA I suppose so . WIN I hate sickness . It 's lucky that I 'm not a nurse . CALLA Because you take .

Andy likes to talk about how I do n't understand him . CALLA I do . Understand him . WIN You mother him . CALLA And if I do ? And if he likes it ? WIN Do you know why Andy and I get along so well . Because we 're blood brothers . Really . He calls me Scout . CALLA I 've known Andy for three years , Win . WIN I guess we 'll all grow old together .

Andy and I are playing Hansel and Gretel hiding nuts in the woods . CALLA I do n't care about a real relationship . WIN Then Andy should make you very happy . CALLA I have a real relationship with everyone I know . Harry said I understood him , his wife did n't understand him . Howie told me what a rotten person he was because he knew I 'd want the truth . Patrick kept talking about freedom and relating to each other . I am so sick of relating to each other so I thought I would try marriage and there is nothing you can do about it .

LUEL She can have a quiet wedding in this dress . CALLA It 's a very loud dress . LUEL ( Meaning CALLA ) That young person has not been brought up well . She has no respect for age . JORY There are three hundred people invited to Vicky 's quiet wedding , Aunt Luel . LUEL I do n't see how you can say I have not consulted you girls about the wedding . Win 's dress is one example . Though I saw Vicky 's wedding as a joyful occasion . Vicky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us dressed in the colours of a springtime forest glade . WIN When I want to play Hansel and Gretel , I 'll tell you . LUEL Your dress is plain . WIN It 's supposed to be plain . It is n't blossom time and gypsy magic . LUEL It does nothing to disguise your condition . p. 67 WIN We can not disguise our condition , Aunt Luel . ( The telephone rings ) CALLA That 's for you . It 's another bomb threat . LUEL Do n't answer the telephone . We are ready for the shower . CALLA May Winrobe is n't here . LUEL If May Winrobe is not polite enough to arrive at a shower when it 's ready to start I can not help her . We 'll tell Vicky she is wanted on the telephone and we 'll cry surprise . Vicky ! It is Arthur on the telephone ! I think you should hide , girls . All girls in the armoire and we 'll all spring out when Vicky gets here and we 'll cry surprise ! ( VICKY enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Surprise ! VICKY ( Picking up the telephone ) Hello . LUEL It 's your shower , Vicky . . . There are presents and teacakes and this is your chair . ( In fact , WIN is sitting in the decorated chair . LUEL stares at her until she moves ) VICKY ( About the telephone ) This is Mrs. Winrobe . Why is she singing " For She 's a Jolly Good Fellow ? " p. 68 LUEL I suppose she 's going to be late , dear . VICKY ( To the telephone ) We 've asked you here tonight because you 're community leaders . . . JORY No pancakes , Vicky . LUEL Jory wo n't mind if we all take a little time off . You work too hard , you girls and I have a list of games that we can play . VICKY What do you mean " no pancakes " ?

I graduated from the university in English and Psychology , but I never let that worry me . CALLA My Aunt Dagmar went to Denver and brought me back some dreadful donuts . LUEL I do n't see why Jory wants to run for Parliament . I suppose it 's penis envy . WIN At least it 's not catching . LUEL Jory is an aggressive or masculine woman , still searching for approval from her father . We all remember Jory 's father , of course . . . He was not a man for games or fun . He was a very serious sort of person but somehow that seems much more likely in a man . Cheer up , Jory . I 'm sure that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant on the other side . CALLA My Aunt Elizabeth went to Edmonton and brought me back eccentric eggs . LUEL ( Some censure . She continues clapping ) It 's Vicky 's turn . CALLA Go ahead , Vicky . VICKY ( Hopelessly .

VICKY If you expect to lead our country , Jory , the least you can do is defuse a crazy old woman playing word games . JORY I can smell something burning , Aunt Luel . LUEL Nonsense . VICKY Something burning in the kitchen . CALLA The oven . WIN The kitchen filling up with smoke . JORY It 's the cream cheese smoothies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VICKY Get out of here , Mother . LUEL I have all the teacakes on the cake plates and the fancies on the lazy susan . You ca n't fool me , you girls . You want to surprise me . You 're trying to get me out of the room so you can arrange the surprise but I know Jory 's kitchen better than that . There is no smoke in Jory 's kitchen . p. 72 VICKY Out ! LUEL You do n't have to surprise me , girls . You should n't have . But I love a surprise so I 'll pretend I hear the kettle boiling . What was that ? JORY I think I hear the kettle boiling . LUEL I will go and see . JORY Calla will get the cream cheese smoothies . CALLA Oh , all right . WIN ( Exit with CALLA ) I 'll eat the lacy raisin wafers .

She said you were better than television . . JORY She could only get the CBC . VICKY She sent you her recipe for banana bread . That 's all she cares about . She does n't care what you do in Ottawa . I hate banana bread . I hate domesticity . I want my own identity . I want my own work . What 's wrong with that ? p. 73 JORY If I did your work , Vicky , I 'd use an assumed name . VICKY No one asks Bill Kelleher why he has moo cow creamers in his motel dining room . JORY That 's true . VICKY Why is he allowed to be mediocre ? Why do I have to be good ? JORY You do n't want to marry Arthur , do you ? VICKY You think that I am marrying Arthur to get out of Saskatchewan , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when someone 's pipes burst . To get away from my mother . No . ( VICKY begins to tear open shower presents ) You think I am going to sit in this stupid looking crepe paper chair and open these presents and smile at May Winrobe and Fay Galen and open up another pop-up toaster . ( VICKY pulls a toaster out of the box ) Look at that . It 's monogrammed . Mother ! ( LUEL appears in the doorway with her eyes closed ) LUEL Is your surprise ready , dear ? May I open my eyes . VICKY I will not have Arthur 's name all over everything . ( LUEL opens her eyes to inspect the toaster ) p. 74 LUEL Well , we ca n't return it , dear . It 's monogrammed . ( VICKY has opened another package to find another toaster ) VICKY Another one ! LUEL Where are the bows ? VICKY What ? LUEL ( Produces a paper plate tied with ribbons ) You want to save the bows . You want to put them on your hat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the word games . And the 10-speed blenders and electric blankets and the crystal stemware and the Canadian sherry . LUEL ( Hugs VICKY . Exit ) We 're going to have the shower ! ( VICKY collects more bows for her hat or does something else that puts her more and more out of touch with reality , as the scene continues ) VICKY Did you and Howard argue ? JORY All the time . VICKY Arthur never argues . He thinks he is some kind of father figure . He smiles at everything I do . JORY You find arguments exciting . You are so romantic , Vicky . p. 75 VICKY I worry if we never fight I 'll find him dull . JORY Do n't be stupid . VICKY Do you think that 's crazy ? There 's another worry . JORY Arguments are dull . VICKY The other thing that worries me. . . he has no previous commitment . JORY By which you mean ? VICKY Every man I 've ever slept with has either been very married or bixexual or else he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that . VICKY Arthur does n't even drink too much . JORY Almost . VICKY Arthur is the only man I ever met without an insurmountable problem . JORY Come on , Vicky . . . VICKY He does n't live with his mother . . . He does n't lead a Boy Scout troupe . He does n't even get head colds very often . Sometimes I think that what I feel for Arthur is relief . That 's all I feel , relief . Is that what marriage is ? JORY No. p. 76 VICKY Arthur does n't have a sense of humour . JORY Neither do you . ( VICKY is awkwardly pulling her wedding dress over her head ) VICKY I am trying to tell you something . . . Because you were Mrs. Howard and Howard died and life and death and you seemed to come through that all right , but I just climb into this silly looking dress and I do n't know why I 'm here . Because my mother had a dream about this dress . Because Arthur is extra agreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good fight . This is such a stupid dress . JORY Do n't wear it then . VICKY The whole wedding is stupid . The whole idea is stupid . JORY Why do n't you forget about the wedding ? VICKY Because I 'm wearing this stupid dress . JORY Why do n't you go off somewhere with Arthur . . . Get married , live together , whatever . . . you do n't need a wedding . VICKY I can see me running off in eighty yards of satin , tulle and peau de soie . JORY Why do n't you talk to Arthur ? p. 77 VICKY I do n't care about Arthur . Do you know what I care about ? I sure as hell do n't . Staying awake , that 's all . ( LUEL enters ) LUEL Ready or not , I 'm coming in . Well . Vicky in her wedding dress . My . What could please me more . Vicky , you look lovely . That 's worth waiting for . ( BLACKOUT ) END OF ACT TWO @x The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room is full of telephones .

VICKY I know who it is and I do n't want to speak to him . I saw him on television . That was enough . LUEL Your soon-to-be , dear . VICKY Arthur is inoffensive . LUEL ( Uncovering the phone ) When she comes home , Arthur , I 'll be glad to have her call you . . . No trouble , I 'll tell her . Good-bye . ( LUEL hangs up ) Arthur told me to tell you he called . VICKY That 's fine , Mother . ( The phone rings . CALLA answers it ) CALLA Hello . . . Oh , hello , Andy . p. 81 VICKY I am having an identity crisis . LUEL Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to Arthur . You are nervous and excited . And Arthur understands that . VICKY Did he ask you to deliver that message as well ? LUEL I can tell by the sound of his voice . CALLA ( To the telephone ) Do n't kid around , Andy . I know it 's you . VICKY I do n't want to talk to Arthur , Mother . LUEL As I say , dear , that 's perfectly all right . Of course it 's all right . CALLA ( To the telephone ) Stop breathing at me . VICKY Arthur is very worthwhile . CALLA No , you ca n't talk to Win . Why would you want to talk to your wife . VICKY Look at the way that Arthur parts his hair . He is well-adjusted . CALLA ( Whether phones are ringing or not ) Thirty-four phones are ringing , Andy . I have n't got time to talk to you now . ( She hangs up ferociously ) p. 82 LUEL ( To VICKY , brightly ) Well , who did you vote for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you vote for , Calla ? ( The phone rings . CALLA answers it ) VICKY Calla ca n't vote in Saskatchewan , Mother . LUEL ( A new horror ) Is she disenfranchised ? CALLA ( To the phone ) The polls were closed at eight o'clock . VICKY We 're too tired , Mother . LUEL Disenfranchised ! Oh , how sad ! VICKY She lives in Ottawa , Mother . LUEL Brave women , years before you girls were born , fought for the vote . VICKY Forget your imitation of the grey-haired booby , Mother . LUEL I voted for Bill Kelleher . CALLA ( On the phone ) Who ? VICKY Bill Kelleher is an axe murderer . p. 83 CALLA ( On the phone ) I do n't think Mr. Diefenbaker ran in this election . LUEL He 's a Conservative . I never thought I 'd vote for a Conservative . VICKY Bill Kelleher is sleazy . LUEL Well , you could n't vote for Jory , could you ? It would n't seem right . VICKY Why not , Mother ? LUEL She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on Jory 's campaign , Mother . We rang doorbells and shook hands and telephoned strangers . We know she is female . LUEL You helped Jory because she was your friend , of course . I 'm very glad that you decided to do that because it was a very ladylike thing to do . ( AS JORY enters ) Hello , Jory . Why are you wearing that dress ? JORY I have to make my victory speech , Aunt Luel . LUEL I always think the Queen looks well in public appearances . JORY I 'll try to find a flowered hat . CALLA You look good in the first polls , Jory. p. 84 VICKY Now you 're a successful public figure , you 've fogotten your friends and your past , You 'd rather hobknob with the wheat kings and the oil barons and the potash potentates . JORY I 've been talking to the Prince Albert Broom and Stone Society . VICKY You 've changed , Jory . JORY No , I have n't . VICKY You have never curled before . JORY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been given the key to the city of Wilkie we wo n't be seeing much of you .

JORY I 'm not smiling , Vicky , I 'm tired . I 've spoken to thirteen Women 's Institutes and eighteen Rotary Clubs and the Elks and the Sons of Scotland . . . VICKY Did you smile at them ? Did you tell them everything was fine ? p. 85 JORY We talked about wheat . VICKY You hate wheat . JORY No I do n't . VICKY You 're a liar , Jory . JORY Why would I hate wheat ? VICKY You could care less about wheat . You say whatever you think people want to hear . You 're a politician . JORY We talked about broadcasting , Vicky .

I 'm all ready to truck down the aisle to Ethiopia dressed up like a toaster . You 're wound up to keep smiling and waving . We 're wound up , Jory . It 's all over . ( The first telephone rings again . CALLA answers it and slams it down ) p. 86 CALLA Hello . . . God damn you , Andy . LUEL Use my police whistle , dear . CALLA He 's drunk , that 's all . VICKY Arthur never gets drunk . CALLA Andy is drunk all the time . VICKY Arthur is always in control . He lives by a master plan . He made that plan when he was twelve years old . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings ) That 's Arthur . On the telephone . He calls me every day . Do n't answer the phones . Just let the phones ring He 'll go away . Arthur is perfect , is n't he ? And I do n't want to talk to him . He always knows the perfect thing to say . ( JORY is concerned by VICKY 'S outburst ) JORY Take the phones off the hook . ( CALLA proceeds to do that ) LUEL You ca n't take the phones off the hook . Those phones are ringing all the time . JORY That 's why I want them stopped . LUEL We wo n't be able to talk to people .

JORY ( To CALLA ) Are the first polls in ? CALLA ( On the HQ phone ) I 'll call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituents . I called Howard about every three months . The last time was about the poor Queen . CALLA ( Hanging up the phone . To JORY ) You 're leading in the first returns . LUEL I was very concerned at the Queen 's last visit , of course . CALLA Elbow looks good . VICKY You see ! LUEL I do n't think we have any evidence to prove the Queen likes ethnic dancing . Horses would be better . The Queen likes horses . JORY Do n't we all , Aunt Luel ? LUEL A precision musical ride . All of the horses in formation spelling out " Welcome Elizabeth R. " . JORY Sort of like sky-writing . LUEL It is Elizabeth R , is n't it ? Rx is the prescription ? p. 88 VICKY Please , Mother . . . LUEL And the massed high school choirs . To sing . CALLA What will they sing ? LUEL God Save the Queen . CALLA From what ? JORY Is that why you voted Conservative ? LUEL No , dear . JORY Why did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who 's going to win , do n't you ? JORY It is n't a horse race . LUEL Did you girls vote for Jory , I hope not . Excuse me , Jory . You may leave the room if you find the conversation too frank . JORY Vicky voted for me , Aunt Luel . LUEL Vicky is not herself . CALLA So did May Winrobe . I drove her to the polling station . She said she would wear her prescription sunglasses , even though they made her feel like Mata Hari . LUEL I do think you carry friendship too far . JORY Aunt Luel. . . p. 89 LUEL The franchise is a privilege . You girls take it much too lightly . Brave women many years before you were born , endured years of ridicule and hardship for women 's suffrage . These women did n't struggle so that you girls could vote for your best friend in Parliament . JORY Yes they did , Aunt Luel . ( LUEL has dialed the phone ) LUEL Hello , May ? Now tell me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jory is going to lobby for a federal cat shelter . JORY I listened to her , Vicky . VICKY A federal Minister should spend her time more usefully than talking to May Winrobe . LUEL ( Hangs up the phone ) May will not tell me who she voted for , which is perfectly correct , of course . And she would not want to hurt your feelings , Jory . JORY She voted for me , Aunt Luel . LUEL May knows women were not built for the stress of public life . They have , you know , " headaches " . JORY We have headaches . We have each other . p. 90 VICKY May Winrobe made Apricot Funny Cake for Jory 's victory party . LUEL She did not . VICKY She said she could not get Frank Rosie 's bumper sticker off her car . LUEL ( Has dialed the phone ) Hello May . . . VICKY Bill Kelleher had buttons but May thought buttons were undignified . CALLA Compared to pancake suppers . LUEL ( To the phone ) What 's this about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask May what she wanted in Ottawa . She had no chance to explain her scheme to solve the energy crisis . LUEL ( Hangs up the phone ) I refuse to say anything more until Jory leave the room . VICKY Do n't go , Jory . LUEL You might as well vote for your old piano teacher . She was a very nice woman . I 'm very angry with you girls . A vote for Jory is a spoiled ballot . That 's the way I see it . JORY The Queen is a woman . p. 91 LUEL We do not vote for queens , Jory . We respect them . We try to emulate them . JORY Do you respect and emulate Bill Kelleher ? LUEL I 've always believed in the principles of Christianity . And Bill Kelleher is a Christian even though you wonder how his motor inn stays open since no one in South Saskatchewan would trust him an inch . " From each according to his ability and to each according to his need " . Is n't that a beatuiful text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes much as you do . JORY But I know what it 's called . . LUEL I 'm sure you do , dear . You 've always been a sensible girl . CALLA It 's no reason to vote for you , of course . LUEL I know you wo n't mind if I speak plainly . That has always been my way . It does n't matter what Jory thinks , does it , because she is only a woman . Here we are , all women , and none of us matters a hoot . JORY But if I win , Aunt Luel . And if I go to Ottawa . And speak up about freight rates . LUEL You wo n't win . p. 92 JORY Sometimes you make me very sad . LUEL We could have had such fun , Jory . All month . Vicky 's wedding parties . There were no showers . No teas . I said I would speak plainly and I feel I must . I believe that Vicky is unhappy and the reason Vicky is unhappy is because she missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . VICKY I 'll leave the room ! LUEL You will not ! VICKY I know you wo n't talk about me if I " m not here . LUEL You should gave given Vicky a shower , Jory . Vicky loves showers . VICKY I do n't . LUEL She likes the fellowship and the fun . . . the games . . . There 's one game where we all have to threat a needle . It 's a race , but I never think it 's wise to run with a threaded needle in your hand . JORY You never run anywhere , Aunt Luel . LUEL You only think about yourself . Your election . That 's all . Standing on the back of a truck in a shopping plaza . You can see why politicians are always men . JORY I used to think that politicians were people . . . that it did n't matter if they were men or women . . . p. 93 LUEL Because they were always men . JORY But you make me wonder , Aunt Luel . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Because you 're a woman . You see yourself as a woman . You believe that women have a special contribution to make to the world . . . LUEL Of course dear . . . JORY And I wonder what it is a woman feels about power and property . . . If you feel as I do . . . LUEL We have a special private contribution . JORY Why does it have to be private ? LUEL I liked your speech in the shopping plaza . I found it moving , Jory . I had to stop myself from shouting Hooray . I do n't know if I told you that . JORY You did n't . LUEL It reminded me of the other side . CALLA What other side ? LUEL Ashanti describes it so vividly . Where men work only for the common good and there is milk and honey . I take milk and honey to be a poetic way of expressing what Jory calls leisure time . All the spirits live in peace and harmony . Their days are full of games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male or female , Auntie Luel ? LUEL ( " Gender " sounds risque ) The spirits do not have gender , Jory . CALLA Or headaches . JORY Aunt Luel trusts all her spirits . CALLA Masculine or feminine or whatever they are . LUEL Ho . Ho . Ho . You can not catch me that way , Jory . JORY I 'm not trying to catch you . LUEL I 'll vote for you when we all pass over to the other side , if you insist . Do you see the joke of that , Calla ? CALLA I 'm sorry . LUEL Because they do n't have elections on the other side . Ho . Ho . Ho . Now you see the joke of it , of course . ( WIN enters ) WIN It is n't funny , Aunt Luel . LUEL Calla does n't have a sense of humour . That is because she 's in love . Ho . Ho . Ho . You ca n't fool me . Vicky rushes to the telephone every day at eight-thirty to talk to Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to her young man . I know the signs . p. 95 WIN Andy asked Calla to marry him . CALLA Yes he did . LUEL There you see . Congratulations . WIN ( To CALLA ) Was he drunk ? CALLA What difference does that make ? WIN Was he drunk ? CALLA Is that all you can say ? He was lonely . He missed me , of course . We spend a lot of time together . WIN So he went down to Le Bar Noir or wherever it is you spend a lot of time . And he got drunk and he called you to ask you to marry him . CALLA That 's right , yes . WIN He put his money where his mouth was . Right down the long distance telephone . LUEL Another wedding . Another chance to wear your lovely dress , Win . WIN Andy never remembers what he tells you when he 's drunk . CALLA Of course he does . WIN He says that 's a trick of diplomacy . He learned it in external affairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever you say does n't count . p. 96 LUEL Romance in the air . WIN Hot air . LUEL I still have the pictures from when Win married Andy . Calla might like to see them . No doubt she 'll want to try for a different effect . CALLA Your soul will rot in hell for lying , Win . VICKY Do n't fight . LUEL They are n't fighting , Vicky . Calla is nervous . Young girls are always nervous before their weddings . You try not to show it , but I know you 're nervous too . VICKY I am not nervous . LUEL No , of course not . Ho . Ho . Ho . VICKY I do n't want to talk about it . LUEL And we wo n't talk about it Vicky . Except that there are arrangements that have to be made . About the reception . About the place settings . About the cake forks . VICKY I do n't care about the cake forks . LUEL Now as you know , I have the family cake forks , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not like the rest of the silver , but that is the fasiion now , is n't it ? The Victorian with the Gothic . Mix and match . So I know that problem is easily solved and we could use the cake forks . They were used at your grandmother 's wedding and my wedding and now your wedding , Vicky , but the question is , will people today know they are cake forks or will they use them for salad ? And am I responsible for the table manners of the people of today ? p. 97 VICKY I will not discuss cake forks for hours on end . LUEL You will have your joke . Ho . Ho . It 's only should there be cake forks or should n't there because the caterer will want to know . VICKY There should n't . No cake forks . LUEL But what about the cake ? VICKY All right . Have them . LUEL Well , whatever you like , dear . . . VICKY Have fish forks and soup spoons and Swiss Army knives . LUEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . VICKY Yes , Mother . LUEL I do n't have that many cake forks . VICKY Do you have one ? LUEL Of course , dear . VICKY I 'll drive it through my heart . ( VICKY exits ) LUEL What 's wrong with Vicky ? JORY She 's tired , Aunt Luel . LUEL Why wo n't she talk to Arthur ? She would find that such a comfort . p. 98 WIN ( Exit ) I 'll ask her . LUEL Arthur is very worried , of course . He calls her every night at eight-thirty . That way he knows she will be back from Saskatoon where she talks to the P-S-Y-C-H-I-A-T . . . JORY R-I-S-T . LUEL That was Arthur 's idea . JORY The spelling ? LUEL The doctor . Arthur has great faith in science . He thinks if Vicky is ever going to spakk to him again , it must be after one of her T-H-E-R-A-P-Y sessions . JORY Why do you spell everything out , Aunt Luel ? LUEL Vicky is having a nervous breakdown , nothing more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs a P-S-Y-C-H-I-A-T-R-I-S-T . I had a nervous breakdown when I was young without a doctor of any kind . JORY Vicky is n't talking to Arthur . She is barely talking to us . LUEL My breakdown was right after Vicky was born . JORY We have to do something , Aunt Luel . When Vicky comes back . p. 99 LUEL I thought the world was coming to an end . I remember that year that there was a strange sect of people in Manitoba , they all had numbers instead of names , I think . They were all going to climb a mountain and wait for the world to end , or perhaps since it was Manitoba , they were going to build a mountain , I do n't know . . . JORY Auntie Luel . . . LUEL It was all I could do to keep from going with them because I knew there would be a cataclysm , do you see ? I used to go around the house after everyone had gone to bed , checking all the locks and doors and windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And sirens . I thought the sirens meant the bombers were coming . Jerry . The nazis . I thought first we would hear that Toronto had been bombed and the planes were still coming West . I thought Winnipeg would be the next target , because of the railroad . I saw the Hudson Bay Store in Winnipeg , an inferno . I thought if the bombers missed us , the Doukhobors would still be here . My husband diagnosed all that as nervous breakdown . Or if he was feeling irritable , and the shortage of rubber used to make him very irritable , then he would call it hysteria , which is a Freudian term . He 'd suggest I take strawberry extract , but he did n't care much what I did and I could n't make him understand it was only because I cared so much about that baby . I did n't want anything to happen to Vicky . p. 100 JORY Auntie Luel , Vicky is n't a baby . LUEL You 're a modern young woman . You know the latest discoveries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should they not ? JORY I do n't think it matters . LUEL Now you see , I did n't know that . Would it make any difference to the baby if her mother worried needlessly over whether she should be fed . JORY I do n't think so . LUEL If I had taken Vicky and gone to build a mountain in Manitoba , would that have made her happy ? JORY She was happy , Auntie Luel . WIN Vicky says she feels much better . She 's going to get dressed for your party , Jory . LUEL We must n't dwell on it . WIN I was n't . LUEL It 's nine o'clock . It 's time for Calla 's telephone call . ( LUEL hangs up one of the telephones ) I know you girls and the telephone . Girls are always on the telephone and why not when you have an admirer so devoted you can set your watch by him . Nine o'clock . ( She looks at her watch pointedly ) Ho . Ho . Ho . I must set my watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has n't called her yet . I 'm only joking , of course . That watch is set to the Dominion Time Signal every morning . p. 101 WIN Why do n't you call him , Calla ? CALLA I do n't have to call him . WIN He wo n't call , you know . The last time you hear from Andy is when he wants to marry you . ( The telephone rings . CALLA jumps to answer it ) CALLA Hello . . We 'll let you know , Mrs. Winrobe . ( She hangs up ) LUEL May Winrobe wants to hear Jory concede , am I right ? That woman has a heart of gold . I hope you appreciate that . But no , May Winrobe is a saint , but do you care ? You cut May Winrobe off without a word , afraid you ' ll miss a call from some young man . WIN If Andy wo n't phone you , I 'll phone him . ( WIN picks up the phone to dial ) LUEL You wo n't mind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In my day , a young woman never called a young man . In fact , we never called anyone long distance . If you are going to call Long Distance , dear , make sure he understands straight off that everything is fine with all of us , except for Jory . WIN Hello , Andy . . . Calla missed your telephone call . . . You know who Calla is , you bastard . . . Drop dead , Andy . ( WIN hangs up ) p. 102 LUEL You see . He was n't pleased , was he ? He felt you were chasing him . Men like to take the initiative . The world has n't changed that much . WIN ( To CALLA ) It 's stupid to apologize for Andy . CALLA I know . Never mind , Win . WIN He said " Who 's Calla ? " CALLA It 's not a big deal . I wanted to marry him , that 's all . WIN But she 'll get over it . That 's what Andy said . Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Oh , hello , Arthur . LUEL Oh , where is Vicky ? JORY Vicky is going crazy , Aunt Luel . CALLA How have you been , Arthur ? LUEL She should be here . She should talk to Arthur . She should write her thank you notes . And if Arthur wo n't be here to talk to Mr. MacIlwaith , then Vicky should visit . Just to assure him that Arthur is n't heathen . WIN He is . LUEL He is a free thinker , dear . That 's what we call them in South Saskatchewan . p. 103 JORY Vicky sees the wedding arrangements are getting out of hand . LUEL I have them in hand . JORY She feels it is her wedding . . . LUEL Jory dear , I 've known you since you were a child , so I know you know better than to interfere between a mother and her daughter , Vicky and I are very close . She and I rarely differ but when we do , she is the first to speak out . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Vicky was living with Arthur , is that the phrase you use ? WIN Was that before or after Vicky wrote about it in MacLeans ? LUEL Vicky tells me these things because she knows she can trust me . And I know I 'll never betray her trust . JORY Vicky wants a civil ceremony . Five minutes at City Hall and a bottle of Scotch . CALLA ( On the phone ) You know me , Arthur . I 'm friendly . And I 'm cheaper than drinking . LUEL Working on the wedding . Working on the election . It 's time we had a little break . It 's time we gathered together our spiritual resources . As Vicky has told you , I am a sensitive . And I feel with all our enterprises here that we 'd do well to make a quiet time to ask for guidance from those who watch over all we do . Girls in a circle . . . ( As no one moves ) Girls in a circle ! Where is Vicky ? Do n't you think Vicky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I ca n't talk to you right now , Arthur . We 're going to have a seance . JORY This is n't the time for a seance . LUEL A seance ? JORY I do n't want to ask the spirits for guidance . CALLA Could this seance tell if a person were going to be married ? LUEL I am not a spiritualist , my dear . I am not one of those foolish and gullible women who runs from one charlatan to another , listening for rappings on the walls and tappings on the table , voices from the great beyond . Oh no . How sad . JORY I did n't say you were gullible , Aunt Luel . . . LUEL I simply know if we have a quiet time together , we 'll be much refreshed . It is as your own mother put it , Jory , like a good cup of tea but much more sensitive somehow . CALLA I 'll turn out the overhead light . LUEL Bring Vicky in here . JORY She is not a human sacrifice , Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . p. 105 LUEL I 'll go into a trance . ( She snaps on a flashlight ) WIN Why is her face green ? LUEL It 's a flashlight , dear . It gives a spiritual effect . JORY Please , Aunt Luel , let 's stop playing Campfire girls . Let 's talk to each other . Vicky will try and tell you what she wants . You and I can talk politics . Anything . ( VICKY enters in her wedding dress . She crosses to the armoire and climbs in ) JORY Vicky ! LUEL I am in a trance , girls . Please be quiet . WIN Why is she wearing that dress ? JORY Please Vicky , come and sit down . LUEL I feel a presence . . . is there someone here ? CALLA It 's Ashanti . Ask him who I 'm going to marry . WIN Why is she climbing into the cupboard ? JORY ( Banging on the door ) Vicky , please come out of there . CALLA There 's someone knocking . Is that Ashanti ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my fault that you took all those pills . Because I am your mother and I contributed to your environment . It was all psychology , I suppose . JORY I ca n't get the door open . LUEL You and that doctor in Saskatoon . That 's what you talk about . What time I fed you when you were a baby . Well , I did n't know . How was I supposed to know ? CALLA The room is getting very cold , is n't it ? Are you there , Ashanti ? LUEL I fed you when your doctor told me to and now your doctor tells you that was wrong . WIN Vicky , please come out of there . LUEL Of course you do . You play word association games . I 've seen it on telelvision . Knife , mother , blood , mother , death , mother . ( LUEL screams . Then her eyes open slowly ) Hands . The spirits attacked me . CALLA ( Eyes still closed ) Ashanti is still knocking . LUEL ( To WIN and JORY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WIN Oh , help . p. 107 LUEL Your disbelief made my experience unpleasant . I saw Arthur but I could not see Vicky . I saw Arthur and Calla drinking Scotch on the steps of City Hall . Ashanti 's joke , you see . CALLA ( Opening eyes ) Really ? LUEL Do not mock , Jory . JORY I 'm not mocking . LUEL You are knocking , which is mocking the spiritual strength we can gain from a silent communion . The spirits are not gullible fools you know . They do n't think that we 'll listen to them when they do something as dubious as knocking on a table . ( There is a knocking from the closet ) Stop that ! JORY I 'm not knocking . LUEL Perhaps one of the reasons Vicky and I are so close is that my daughter appreciates the way she was brought up . I taught Vicky to value the truth , for one thing . . . Stop that knocking . WIN It 's the cupboard . It 's Vicky in the cupboard . LUEL There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For your dress , Win , and Vicky 's . ( LUEL opens the closet door . VICKY , dressed in her wedding dress , falls out into someone 's arms ) p. 108 WIN What 's wrong with her ? CALLA Surprise . LUEL Vicky ! JORY She 's breathing . LUEL She 's not breathing . JORY Walk her around . Get coffee . ( They drag her around the room , picking up the coffee pot in passing , feeding her coffee which drips down her face ) JORY Is she breathing ? WIN She 's not breathing . LUEL The kiss of life . ( LUEL tries to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while the others try to keep VICKY walking ) JORY She 's got to keep moving . WIN What 's wrong with her ? CALLA She 's taken pills . WIN What pills ? CALLA Your pills . My pills . She looks like she 's taken pills . LUEL Vicky does not take pills . CALLA God struck her then . p. 109 LUEL I took my First Aid certificate with St. John 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more my style . CALLA You can be second . LUEL Vicky would not attempt suicide . JORY Try to get that coffee down her throat . LUEL Vicky loves life . JORY Vicky loves popping pills . CALLA Look at her eyes . They 're perfectly clear . WIN Should n't we make her throw up . LUEL Oh ! Throw up ! Oh ! JORY I do n't know . I guess so . LUEL On her dress ? VICKY Give me an E.E . Give me an L.L. Give me a B.B. give me an O.O . Give me a W.W. JORY What 's she doing ? LUEL Vicky does not take sleeping pills . WIN She 's cheering . JORY That 's right , Vicky . Keep cheering . ( JORY and WIN begin cheering along with VICKY , parading up and down the room , dragging VICKY between them ) p. 110 VICKY Orange and red . That 's what I said . Let 's hear a cheer for the orange and red . LUEL Give her air . There 's no air in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to C-O-M-M-I-T S-U-I-C-I-D-E . JORY Try to get the coffee down her throat . LUEL Vicky tried to C-O-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M- VICKY ( Summons all her energies ) I am going to change the world . ( The telephone rings ) LUEL If someone does n't get that telephone , I think , I 'll lose my mind . CALLA ( On the telephone ) It 's campaign headquarters . ( The telephone ring has frozen the scene . Everyone is still , waiting for the results ) LUEL I never thought I 'd see the day that Bill Kelleher was MP for South Saskatchewan . That man has absolutely no regard for human dignity . CALLA You won , Jory . They want to know when you 're coming down . . . p. 111 LUEL Jory won ? CALLA I ca n't hear anything . They 're all screaming down there . VICKY She won . Jory . Jory won . LUEL Everybody here is yelling . WIN Jory won ! CALLA Eighty-four polls reporting . JORY Who voted for me ? What do they want ? LUEL Jory won ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JORY No , I have n't . VICKY Where 's your blanket ? Answer me that . Why are n't you going around underneath a blanket ? You do n't even have your blanket . You do n't have your victory speech . I had to write a speech for you . . . ( She hands her a sheaf of notes ) JORY ( It 's unintelligible ) I ca n't read this , Vicky . . . LUEL I 'm going to call May Winrobe . ( But the telephone rings ) Hello , May . CALLA I 'm going to call Arthur . p. 112 VICKY Now you read this speech , Jory . . . WIN ( Trying to read over JORY 'S shoulder ) I think it 's her suicide note . VICKY And after you thank your campaign manager and your staff and so on , then a Brownie troupe will come in and present you with an armful of wild flowers . ( LUEL blows a police whistle into the phone ) We 'll go to Ottawa , Jory . WIN With the Brownie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging ? ( The telephone rings again ) LUEL Do n't answer that telephone !
