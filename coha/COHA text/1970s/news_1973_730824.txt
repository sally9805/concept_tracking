txt The 60-day price freeze just announced by President Nixon buys time for the White House to work out a " more effective system of controls " to curb the nation 's worst inflation since the Korean war . Because " voluntary " ' Phase 3 controls have failed to halt surging prices , the President seems to be saying , the U.S. ? after the freeze ? must return to something like the mandatory wage and price controls of Phase 2 . The shape of Phase 4 is still unclear , for Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz , Chairman Herbert Stein of the Council of Economic Advisers , and their aides , all have argued that shortages , rationing , and black markets would result , from planting controls on an economy , running ? at full tide : For the next two , months Americans will pay no more for their food , gasoline , and other , consumer goods than they paid during the first week of June . To President Nixon , several recent , events apparently outweighed the validity of the advice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May , or 24 percent at an annual rate ? an upsurge that shocked even the Shultz-Stein team ' . ? Congress was threatening to take matters into its own hands and legislate a 90-day freeze on prices , profits , wges , and rents . ? Distrustof White House ability to curb inflation was evidenced by a plunging stock market on Wall Street and a weakening dollar overseas . Nixon buys time Faced by this confluence of events , the President reversed ? himself and decreed a 60-day price freeze . All prices , except for raw agricultural products at the farm , level , before their first sale , are fTozen immediately at their- level : of the period June 1 through 8 . This means that farmers , beset by rising prices for feed grains and other supplies , may charge higher prices . But middlemen are forbidden to pass the increase along . . Wages are exempt from the freeze , but remain under the Phase 3 guideline . This restricts , wage increases , plus fringe benefits , to 6.2 percent yearly . The exemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major contracts settled so far this year have clung to the guidelines . Contracts involved A wage freeze also would have thrown a monkey wrench into key contracts now being negotiated and would have aroused the , ire of the trade-union movement . Exempted , from the freeze are rents , profits , - interest rates , and dividends . The price freeze may end in less than 60 days if the White House hammers out Phase 4 policy before that-deadline. // *Price freeze : What comes next ? // Singling out food prices as a major cause of inflation , the President asked Congress " on an urgent basis " to give him authority to control food exports . " Unprecedented demand abroad " for American farm products , noted Mr. Nixon , have helped to drive up food prices , as domestic and foreign demand compete for scarce supplies . " We must , " he said , " put the American consumer first . " This was a ' retreat from the earlier White House position that booming U.S. farm exports would help to narrow the United States trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , and with imported oil costing steadily more , the Nixon ' administration was counting heavily on U.S. farm sales to counteract the trend . Mr. Nixon 's call for export controls aroused concern in Japan , the single largest buyer of American food ? exports . Doubt also was cast on how much grain the U.S. could offer to sell Russia this year . , Grain sales almost certainly will figure in the conversations the President will have in Washington next week with Soviet Communist Party chief Leonid I. Brezhnev . The 60. : day freeze , the President declared , will afford time " to develop and put into place a new and more effective system of controls , " designed to " contain the forces that have sent prices so rapidly upward in the past few months . " Clearly the system must be tougher than the " voluntary " Phase 3 , which has allowed prices to skyrocket at the highest rate since the Korean war . Course reversed But Mr. Nixon confronts a dilemma . Only a few weeks ago , on May 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for the superficially simple solution ? to freeze prices across the board or even roll them back . " He is doing now what he rejected then ? but , with consumers paying higher prices than they would have , ? had he acted in May . As for Phase 4 controls , Mr. Shultz , Dr. Stein , and John T. Dunlop , director of the Cost of Living Council , are on record opposing a return to blanket ' controls . " The Phase 4 that followd the freeze , " the President stressed , " will not be designed to get us permenently into a controlled economy . On the contrary , it will be designed as a better way to get us out of a controlled economy , and to return us as quickly as possible to the free market system . " This is just what the Shultz-Stein duo hoped to accomplish , when they urged the President to end Phase 2 last January . The result was rampant inflation . ' How does the President now , devise a new set of controls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pent-up price pressures bursting forth again ?
