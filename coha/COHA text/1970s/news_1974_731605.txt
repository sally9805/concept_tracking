txt A fertility drug that has produced multiple births in women may also enable infertile men to father children , a Duke University surgeon reported Thursday . The drug , called clomiphene c i t r at e , also reportedly increases the sexual libido of the men , but it is too early to say if it is a true aphrodisiac , said Dr. David F. Paulsen . Preliminary findings with 22 men indicate that the drug may be helpful in treating 50 to GO per cent of all infertile men , Dr. Paulson reported at the annual meeting of the American College of Surgeons . TEN PER CENT of all married couples are unable to have children because of infertility problems and it is estimated that the problem lies with the husband in half of the cases , he said . A major cause of infertility in males is a low sperm count . Without an adequate number . of sperm there is little likelihood that one , . sperni will reach the female egg to fertilize it . The sperm count normally ranges between 120 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count falls below 100 million , the chances of conception become significantly less . After a 90-day treatment period , the sperm count of 13 of the infertile men increased up to 300 million , Dr. Paulson said , SO FAR , three of the patients ' wives have become pregnant , he added . Some of the women also . were receiving the drug for their infertility problems , he added . Many of the women reported that . their husbands became more sexually aggressive while taking the drug , Dr. Paulson said . The drug , which has been used since the 1960s for treating female intertility problems , appears safe in men and it has not produced side ' effects , he said . The compound appears to work by activating the hypothalamus to produce a so-called FSH hormone releasing factor . The factor travels to the pituitary , where it stimulates the production of the Hit hormone . FSII stands for follicle stimulating hormone . In women , FSH stimulates the release of an egg from the ovaries.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
