Now it is Chicago 's turn <P> " Curiouser and curiouser , " Alice might have said . In Chicago last week , a black federal judge , heeding the arguments of a Jewish lawyer , ruled that American Nazi Frank Collin and a handful of brown-shirted followers could hold a rally in Chicago 's Marquette Park . <P> Collin has been seeking permission to demonstrate in the allwhite , working-class neighborhood for more than a year . After being thwarted by the city 's requirement of a $60,000 bond to pay for any damage , the self-styled Fhrer shockingly decided to march instead in Skokie , a heavily Jewish suburb of 66,200 people , including several thousand survivors of Hitler 's death camps . Skokie immediately invoked a series of ordinances to stop him , which were all overturned by state and federal courts . <P> But leaders of the militant Jewish Defense League promised that about 3,500 members would block the march , by force if necessary . Collin and his 90 or so friends had little stomach for that confrontation . Instead , they obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not require the bond and had to issue them a permit for a rally on July 9 in Marquette Park , near their headquarters . Said half-Jewish Collin ( his Jewish father spent several months in Dachau ) : " My overall goal was always Marquette Park , where I can speak to my own white people rather than a mob of howling creatures in the streets of Skokie . " Collin may find no peace on his home ground either : Black and Jewish leaders have promised to stage counterdemonstrations in Marquette Park on the same day .
