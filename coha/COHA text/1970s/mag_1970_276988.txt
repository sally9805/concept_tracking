Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public . <P> -H . L. Mencken <P> Quite a few advertising men apparently accept Mencken 's waspish assessment . Though much current advertising is superior by any standards , there is an abundance of tasteless , exaggerated or misleading ads . Today 's increasingly sophisticated consumer is exposed to 1,600 selling messages a day , and he feels abused or insulted by many . As a result , shoddy and deceptive advertising is the subject of growing debate inside and outside the profession . <P> The Government is deeply concerned . Last week Bryce Harlow , national affairs counselor to President Nixon , warned a Washington conference of the American Advertising Federation that agency officials must monitor more closely the claims they make for products or else face speedier federal intervention . He pointed to a number of bills in the House and Senate , all supported by the Administration , that would give the Federal Trade Commission immediate power to seek preliminary injunctions against deceptive ads . Now the FTC often must wage lengthy court battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if it were armed with a preliminary injunction , the commission could act before , instead of after a court decision . Said Harlow : " The existence of this power in the FTC does create the possibility of a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign being stopped in its tracks . " <P> Outright deception is rare . Many commercials retreat into a world of pure fantasy , in which humor and Madison Avenue mythology explore hard-sell claims to product superiority . The agencies have created an unearthly band of mnemonic miracle-makers-a White Knight , a Green Phantom , Josephine the lady plumber , Mr. Clean the bacteriophobic eunuch , and the Man from Glad , who is gussied up in platinum hairdo and white trench coat . In one ad , a failing used-car salesman takes a dollop of Listerine mouthwash , and customers start buying without waiting for the sales pitch . In another commercial , a bespectacled , frumpish old maid uses Ice Blue Secret deodorant and is transformed into a glamorous beauty ; presumably , even her eyesight is improved because at the end she no longer wears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witty president of Freberg Ltd. , believes that ads generally have never been worse . " Tastefulness is probably the last thing an agency thinks about , " he says . " The only thing lower on the scale is , ' How will this ad be received in the Sudetenland ? ' " To Freberg , all that is unbelievable and insulting in advertising is contained in a commercial for Head &; Shoulders shampoo , in which a bride takes time out from her wedding preparations to deal with her father 's dandruff . The father 's punch line : " I have n't lost a daughter ; I 've gained a dandruff shampoo . "
