The American dollar has been declining irregularly on world money markets for the past five years , but never in the postwar period has its value against major European currencies sunk so low for so long . Since last September , the greenback has fallen roughly 13% against the Belgian franc , Dutch guilder and West German mark , and has lost 20% of its former worth in French and Swiss francs . Last week U.S. currency fell below the level of four francs to the dollar for the first time since 1973-and the consequences of its slump were making some disturbing waves . <P> On a state visit to the U.S. , the Shah of Iran disclosed that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will probably use the weakness of the dollar to justify another increase in oil prices this fall . The oil producers have complained repeatedly that the shrinking value of the dollar , which is the chief currency used in oil transactions , has steadily reduced their ability to buy industrialized goods . Indeed , an unconfirmed press report out of Saudi Arabia last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an unspecified amount as early as June . Washington officials discount the report , but they do not rule out an oil price boost of up to 15% in September . <P> Americans traveling abroad , especially in Europe , are running into nightmarishly high prices . Part of the reason is European inflation . But , relatively , prices for Americans spending weakened U.S. currency are even higher . A single room at such hotels as Amsterdam 's Hilton and Cologne 's Inter-Continental now cost at least $50 a night , v. as low as $35 18 months ago . A modest dinner for two in Switzerland-cheese fondue and a bottle of wine-can run to $30 . In Paris , peaches from Southern France sell for the equivalent of $8 each , and a cup of coffee rarely costs less than 60 . <P> Moreover , as the dollar 's value shrivels , the cost of foreign imports into the U.S. swells , contributing to American inflation . A fully equipped Volkswagen Rabbit , for instance , can now carry a price tag of nearly $4,000-as much as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dollar 's dip helps U.S. exports by reducing their price in foreign countries . <P> The strangest aspect of the dollar 's slump is that it continues despite wide agreement among fiscal experts that the greenback is now drastically undervalued . According to the West German Statistical Office , a dollar in the U.S. now buys as many goods as 2.94 marks will in Germany-yet the dollar was being traded in Germany last week for only 2.33 marks . The most immediate reason is that for months , American interest rates have been dropping , while in Europe rates were rising . Seeking the highest return , investors , including American-based multinational firms , have been dumping dollars and buying into currencies such as the franc . In France , the prime interest rate now is more than 12% v. as little as 7% in the U.S.
