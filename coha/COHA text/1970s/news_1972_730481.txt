txt A new battle cry sounds from American conservation throats , weakly for the moment , but gaining strength in congressional ears . Object : to save for the nation 478,535 acres of New Mexican mountains and lakes , trees and wildlife , one of the largest single chunks of privately owned land left in the United States and which may be headed for the subdivider 's chopping block . The House version of a Senate-passed bill authorizing purchase of the Vermejo ranch as an addition to the adjoining Carson National Forest comes up shortly for a vote . Although the legislation carries no appropriation , and would ordinarily be noncontroversial , the possibilities for passage are uncertain . Because of its late introduction , the bill will be considered on a suspension-of-rules procedure that requires a two-thirds majority . It is opposed by the administration , which considers other new areas to have a higher priority . Environmental lobby But the National Wildlife Federation , Sierra Club , Izaak Walton League of America , and other national and New Mexican environmental groups are working for its passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America , an entire watershed with 60 mountain lakes , more than 100 miles of trout streams , timberland , and grasslands , a herd of about 25,000 deer , 7,000 to 10,000 elk , as well as bears , mountain lions , and other wild animals and birds . The chief sponsor in the House , Rep. Manuel Lujan ( R ) of New Mexico , sees an added advantage in Vermejo acquisition : The land , which now grazes 10,000 head of cattle , could benefit many nearby small ranchers who urgently need public-landgrazing territory . The U.S. Forest Service covets the area for its 220,000 acres of ponderosa pine and other timber and for its recreation and environmental-education potential . The administration , however , is giving its highest priority for Land and Water Conservation Fund projects close to big cities . The Department of Agriculture was required to testify against the Vermejo bill although the ranch is No. 1 on the Forest Service 's acquisition list . Land-grant territory The Vermejo ranch is the heart of the historic Maxwell land grant , subject of an 1887 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico in 1841 . It lies on both sides of the towering Sangre de Cristo mountains . The few jewellike 13,000-foot mountain lakes are comparable in beauty to the nearby Taos Indian shrine , Blue Lake . A wealthy Texan , William J. Gourley , acquired the bulk of the property in 1945 , and improved the land extensively . When Mr. Gourley passed on in late 1970 , Mrs Gourley decided to sell the ranch as a complete tract . The past two years it has been operated for private hunting and fishing with an elk and deer hunting fee set at $700 , and fishing at $20 a day . Chief administration arguments against acquisition include its remoteness from population centers ; that it would be used primarily by visitors who are close to other wildland recreations opportunities ; that it is undesirable economically because most of the timber , oil and coal rights already have been sold ; and that too much of New Mexico ( 34 percent ) already is owned by the federal government . Price too high ? Some members of Congress also have suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acre , is too high . Advocates of federal purchase believe the price is fair compared with similar land prices in the area , and considering scenic quality of the area . Failure to purchase the land and allowing it to be subdivided , they say , would result in erosion , stream pollution , and eventual loss of a watershed that would be far more costly in the long sun . Above all , they seek to save a priceless ipart of America 's scenic heritage . // *Subdividing the scenery ? // Those working for federal acquisition argue that it could be paid off over several years out of the $300 million-a-year Land and Water Conservation Fund . The Nature Conservancy , a nonprofit organization that helps preserve land , has indicated it would seek to hold the parcel until Congress voted an appropriation . Conservationists also say that the outstanding timber , oil , and mining leases are all compatible with the multiple-use principle of forest service management . A comparatively small mountain section of the ranch is unroaded and could qualify as winderness . The entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.6 percent . And the land is needed for recreation ? the Vermejo ranch contains water resources four times greater than those on all the existing national forest lands in the state . Three members of the House Agriculture Committee , Chairman W. R. Poage ( D ) of Texas , Thomas S. Foley ( D ) of Washington , and Keith Sebelius ( R ) of Kansas made a trip to the ranch Sept. 17 to see for themselves if the area warranted purchase . The next week thay all said " aye " in a 13-12 committee vote that cleared the bill for floor action . " The Vermejo ranch purchase should be the highest priority for addition to the nation 's national forest system , " says Ted Pankowski , director of Environmental Affairs for the Izaak Walton League . " With its many high lakes and variety of ecosystems , it is unique for . the Southwest . It will bring recreation benefits , could make a model environmental education area , and offers fish and wildlife protection , timber management , and oil and deep-mine coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area . It should be saved intact for this and future generations . "
