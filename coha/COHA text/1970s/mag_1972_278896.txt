It is a wry paradox of art history that some of the most influential sculptures of modern times were never actually seen by the men they influenced . They were four metal-rod constructions that Picasso made in 1928-29 . Known only from photographs , these light , airy images-a form of " drawing in space " - helped shift the attention of postwar sculptors in America and Europe away from the solid block and toward open structure . But Picasso never allowed them to be sold to a dealer , a collector , or a museum ; they remained in his own collection in France after they had been rejected by a committee for a memorial to Picasso 's friend , Poet Guillaume Apollinaire . ( " What did they expect me to make , a muse holding a torch ? " Picasso grumbled later . ) <P> Now New York 's Museum of Modern Art announces that Picasso has given its sculpture garden a 15-foot-high version of one of these works , Construction in Wire , 1928 . Based on a smaller maquette he made ten years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will go to the museum in early fall . Thus there will be two key Picasso sculptures in the U.S. ( the other is the sheet-metal Guitar , 1912 ) , and MOMA has them both , as presents from the artist . Picasso 's evident fondness for the museum-which already has the best collection of his work anywhere-started a crop of new rumors about the possible destination of the huge collection of Picasso 's own Picassos after his death .
