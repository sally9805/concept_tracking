 | A Modest Proposal : Pulling the Pulg on Lake Erie THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE took place in 1813 , when Oliver Hazard Perry subdued the British naval squadron at Put-in-Bay . For ecologists , however , the real Battle of Lake Erie is now ; the enemy is ourselves . The lake is being inundated by human , industrial , and agricultural wastes ? nutrient-ricli gunk that fertilizes algae . which then erupt and consume the water 's vital oxygen . Lack of oxygen is suffocating the 9,910-square-mile lake as surely as a lack of oxygen kills the human body . Frank Ogden watches this deterioration with a perverse satisfaction , for the failure to cleanse the lake and its tributary streams makes more likely the ultimate adoption of the solution he and his friends propose for Erie 's pollution problems . Quite simply . they want to drain it . " Lake Erie is a cesspool and it 's beyond hope , " Ogden says . " So let 's turn defeat into something positive for the area . In 25,000 years , the erosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A faculty member of the Ontario College of Art in Toronto , Frank Ogden bases his Erie idea on the inspired toils of the Dutch , who have reclaimed vast acreages from the sea , pumping out the water to make new fields flower . Pulling the plug on Lake Erie would he an easier engineering feat , Ogden insists , leaving behind a shallow basin of more than five million acres for new cities , farms , and recreation areas . Canals for pleasure craft and cargo-laden steamships would lace this Promised Land , which would even include a tiny nation ? a new home for the U.N . A grand piece of planetary engineering requires a grand name . one like Project Sudarzana . " It cones from the exclamation the Mongol invaders reportedly made when they first saw the Plains of India , " Ogden says . " It means beautiful vision , and I see it as that , a beautiful vision of a new plain . " Project Sudarzana originated with the International Synetics Foundation . an informal think tank Ogden organized with seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pulling the plug on Lake Erie 48 soured in early 1968 when Ogden and company gathered in a copper-mine tunnel ( nothing unusual ? they once met in the gondola of a barrage balloon ) that jutted under Howe Sound near Britannia Beach , British Columbia . " I guess we were thinking water , " Ogden recalls . " The basic idea came from Wayne MacCulloch , a highschool teacher . Collectively we saw within a few hours what MacCulloch 's idea could be . " @# SINCE PUBLISHED IN DETAIL , the foundation 's proposal is easy to grasp , if not accept . Noting that the lake 's average depth is fifty-eight feet , it suggests lowering the water level by seventy feet , draining all but Erie 's deepest pocket , a 210-foot hole off Long Point , Ontario . Thus Erie would shrink from an inland sea to a relative puddle , an irregularly shaped body of water roughly thirty miles long and twenty miles wide . The draining process would begin at the lakes eastern end . A ninety-foot channel would be chiseled through Niagara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ontario . With locks for shipping , the new cut would replace Ontario 's twenty-seven-mile Welland Ship Canal . whose eight locks now carry shipping up and down between the two lakes . Once through Niagara Falls , St. Lawrence Seaway traffic would pass through the drained lake bed via a canal straddling the U.S.-Canadian border . Smaller channels would branch off to current port cities or new docking facilities built near them . A darn-and-lock system near Detroit would hold back Lake Huron 's waters and provide shipping access to the upper Great Lakes . Lakefront property owners would be compensated with new lands on the canals and rivers , or along the shores of new lakes set in the recreation areas . For millions of years , rains and snows have fallen upon the lands surrounding Lake Erie . eroding soil enriched by the timeless decay of trees and bushes and grasses . Countless streams and rivers have carried this black earth to the @#  | lake , where it has settled , building up layers of priceless silt over much of the bottom . " The est soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Ogden . On this bottom land Ogden sees new cities , farms to feed millions , huge recreation areas . The cities would be a utopian 's delight , designed for living , not mere survival . Motor vehicles would be limited . Monorails , moving sidewalks , and community-owned bicycles would move residents around town . The cities would seek pollution-free industries rather than dirty plants belching noxious fumes . Buildings would blend with the natural contours of the land . Apartment houses would resemble giant grape clusters , with each grape an individual apartment unit . " Grapes , as they grow on the vine , are an ideal arrangement , " says Ogden . " Each grape has the maximum viewing area . The key to Ogden 's pollutionless paradise is a -till-experimental process of water disposal called the " implosion chamber . " This is a deep , covered pit in which refuse is burned at high temperatures . " The ones I 've seen are covered with layers of sand , " he says . " A hole is drilled through the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air is forced in , so the flame is fed a lot of oxygen . If there 's an automobile , glass , whatever , it just melts down to almost nothing . Ninety-two per cent of the volume vanishes . Of the 8 per cent that 's left , approximately threequarters can be used for highway surfacing and all kinds of building materials because it 's so r damn hard . Also , there is water in the chamber and it is being heated tremendously . So the team could be used to generate electricity , or it could be piped to these new cities for heating , ? , r both . " Upon the new land would rise a tiny nation dedicated to world peace and international understanding . " The whole United Nations would move there , " Ogden says , supremely confident that the U.N . would accept his lakeland Liechtenstein . " What we 're proposing is that Canada and the United States each donate forty - pare miles . This would be declared the U.N . Country , or whatever . We are suggesting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park containing the world 's largest zoo , housed under a geodesic dome . Visitors would view the wild animals in their native environment safely by walking through plastic tubes . " @# WHILE CREATING NEW CITIES and lands , the draining of Lake Erie would destroy Niagara Falls , stilling its thunder and drying its perpetual mist . Lovers and others who once gazed at the falls ' power and beauty would find instead the world 's largest rock garden , covered by a gigantic geodesic dome . The land beneath would be heated to tropical temperatures yearround . The rocks would flower with tropical flora . " I think Niagara Falls has had its day , " says Ogden . " In this age of increasing sexual permissiveness , marriage is out . Without marriage , who needs a honeymoon , and without a honeymoon , who needs Niagara Falls ? If you want to see falls , go see Angel Falls in South America or something on the Zambezi River in Africa .

Rainfall would decrease , but not much . " Water tables would drop in the immediate vicinity of the existing lake borders , " he explains , " but the drop would be far less just five miles from the present shoreline . " Ogden acknowledges that he and his fello visionaries have not yet put a price tag on their cosmic dream of draining Erie . But the sale or lease of rich new lands , they argue , would surely pay all costs . " America needs a new frontier , " declares Frank Ogden , as if proposing the colonization of Mars . " Here you wo n't have to tear down anything , causing expropriation battles and alienating people . You 've got a new place that nobody has been before . It should be drained . "
