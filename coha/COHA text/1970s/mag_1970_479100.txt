The Unity School of Practical Christianity , in Lee 's Summit , Missouri , is a profoundly American institution . It was founded on prayer , and still lives by it . The School 's Department of Silent Unity shipped out more than 700,000 prayers to the world last year , all of them in answer to personal requests . More than 6,000 letters , telegrams , and telephone calls reach the Silent Unity building each day . A second-story window in the building glows perpetually ; inside is a telephone room where workers answer calls around the clock . Long before suicide centers , poison-control centers , and Dial-a-Priest , Unity waited patiently for your call , and waits at this moment . " There were three connecting rooms , " writes Dr. Marcus Bach in The Unity Way of Life , a Prentice-Hall book , " but the one I recalled this night was the one with the perpetually burning light , the votive light of prayer . There was a large round table in the center of that room , divided into arcs and equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quiet tones , and I thought I heard them give thanks to those who called that every need is already fulfilled . " That is Unity 's sort of prayer , positive and affirmative and a little wacky , and it has its reward . Prayer requests account for half of Unity 's income ; testimonials returned to Unity by those snlio believe themselves helped usually contain a gift of money , a " love offering " in Unity 's term . The other half of Unity 's income comes from subscriptions to its several periodicals , which are more or less self-supporting . Daily Word , a monthly calendar of scriptural meditations , is the best known . " Silent Unity , " says an officer of the School , " generates a great number of free-will offerings . Support for what I call our ' outreach ' programs comes this way . These buildings were built that way . The property was acquired that way . " But Unity does not disclose financial figures . " It 's not that they 're secret , " the officer says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do . " The Internal Revenue Service , he points out , reapproved their tax-exempt status some years back . The size of unity 's operations and the number of its employees suggest income of several millions a year . The prayer work is the thing that made Unity , " according to James Dillet Freeman of Unity . Freeman is a handsome man of middle height and middle age . Iced with silver-gray hair , dressed in suede and corduroy , he looks the American poet he believes himself to be . Like many public lecturers , he speaks English when discussing the spirit . American when discussing the flesh . He believes in the Unity movement , and has given it his life . He is its historian , its permanent poet-in-residence , and a teacher at its School . " Prayer attracted the people , " he explains . " Heal ? ing is still a big item . The thing about this place ? and this is true ? is that it 's always attracted people who very much believed in what they were doing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that they 're serving ? that their prayers are effective . Unity maintains a constant round-the-clock prayer watch . They used to pass picture of Jesus Christ from desk to desk . If the picture came on your desk then you went into the prayer room and prayed until somebody else eamt in . There 's no cynicism here . " " We have two things to give people , " Freemat continues . " One is a feeling of faith ? we are pray ing with you . You 're not alone . Two , you 're loved ? here 's somebody thinking of you , caring for you , interested in you and your welfare . Most human beings need these ? pretty strongly . If we did nothing else than this , we 'd do enough . These are the great things we 've got to give people . Probably 650,000 people contact us every year . Most of it is word of mouth . Somebody is in trouble and someone tells them about us . " Unity maintains its perpetual prayer watch in a chapel down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requests into baskets at the front of the chapel , where they absorb prayers for a month or so before being removed . " I think they stay there about sixty days now . " Freeman says . That is a powerful dose of a sovereign remedy . Years ago , Unity printed a healing prayer on a red insert page in its monthly magazine ; overzealous believers physically applied what they called the " red leaf " to their afflictions . Unity chided them for the practice , but gently , for who knows the ways of God ? Prayer , tapping the free energies of the universe , may well work as a metaphysical unguent , a subtle and cosmic Ben-Gay . Unity reaches out with many limbs . The School trains workers for Unity 's churches ( called " centers " to avoid any whiff of denomination ) and publishes the organization 's many books , periodicals , and leaflets in its own printing plant . Silent Unity handles prayer and healing requests . Silent 70 , named from Luke 10:1 ( After these things the Lord appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his face into every city and place , whither he himself would come ) , supplies free Unity magazines , tracts , and books to the prisons of America . The Braille department makes Unity materials available to the blind . The Department of World Unity spreads the Good Word across the world , and lately , according to Unity spokesmen , is making great inroads in England , where church attendance is down to 3 per cent of the population . T he past shadows the present , at Unity as throughout the Midwest . The traditional European forms of Christian worship ? the cathedral and the priest , the solid stone church and the solid stone pastor ? never were available in quantity on the frontier , and it could not have sat still for them if they were . Midwestern settlers wanted Higher Guidance ; not finding it in traditional religion , which only reluctantly moved west , they devised their own . They injected religion into business and invented the Chamber of Commerce , into politics and invented Honest Government , into personal behavior and invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their Christianity , but they expected it , as William James did , to perform . The turn of the century was high tide for this new-time religion . It stirred more sentiment than passion . Charles Monroe Sheldon 's In His Steps , written out of Topeka , Kansas , began its climb to all-time best sellerdom in 1897 , proposing that each of us literally follow Jesus ' example , and many tried , including the founders of Unity , to the best of their understanding . When In His Steps came to town by lecture and lantern slide , grown women wept . New Thought steamed out of Boston and New York and Chicago on the 20th Century Limited ; Mary Baker Eddy 's pinched , Bostonian Christian Science began building its mock-Episcopal fortresses : healers roamed the countryside with magical incantations and bottomless pocketbooks , and the Midwest turned on . A businessman and his wife founded Unity . Charles Fillmore was a real-estate salesman who dabbled in gold mining , popular science , and comparative religion at a time when all three were rich in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if his ingenious and attractive wife Myrtle had n't got interested in faith healing . In her letters , published after Unity was well under way , she would gently insist that she had started the movement . She had , but her husband made it work . Charles Fillmore was born in a log cabin on an Indian reservation in Minnesota in 1854 . A Sioux medicine man carried him off for the day when he was only two years old . " Where they had taken him and what they had done with him , Charles could not remember . ' James Freeman writes in his history of Unity , " but he always had a feeling that they had used him in some mystical ceremony . " When Charles was seven , his trader father moved to an ? other cabin ten miles away , and after that the boy and his younger brother Norton divided their time between the cabins of their parents . They harvested wild rice . Indian-style ; they wandered among the lodges , witnessing who knows what oddities of living ; they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tender age and never returned . Charles dislocated his hip one day in a skating accident . The leg failed to set properly , and developed a bone infection . " I was bled , leeched , cupped , lanced , seasoned , blistered , and roweled , " Fillmore later told Freeman . " Six running sores were artificially produced on my leg to draw out the diseased condition that was presumed to be within . Physicians of different schools were employed , and the last one always wondered how I ever pulled through alive under the treatment of the ' quack ' that preceded him ; and as 1 look back at it now it 's a miracle to me how 1 ever got away from them all with the little bundle of bones and sinews that I found in my possession after they had finished their experiments . " The leg withered and grew no more . All his life , " Papa Charley , " as Unity workers called Charles Fillmore , would pray the leg longer , though there is little evidence that it responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fillmore went to work as a printer 's devil in St. Cloud , Minnesota . He worked in a grocery store and a bank . He befriended the son of an Army officer , and the boy 's college-educated mother ? a rarity in those days ? plied her son 's bright friend with books ? Shakespeare , Tennyson , Emerson , Lowell , Whittier . Much later , Charles would name one of his sons Waldo Rickert. another Lowell , in honor of his beloved Transcendentalists , and there is much of New England mysticism in Unity , oddly blended , as it oddly blends , with Christianity . In St. Cloud , Fillmore read about the West and found it challenging . He traveled to Denison , Texas , a town reputed to be as rough as they came in those days . but it was at a literary society meeting in Denison that Charles met the redheaded schoolteacher . Myrtle Page . She had attended Oberlin College . She believed she had inherited tuberculosis . She had unusual religious ideas . When she returned to Clinton , Missouri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and books . He lost his job in Denison and went north to Colorado , where he started to deal in real estate . He plucked Myrtle out of Missouri after marrying her there in 1881 . In Pueblo , Colorado , Fillmore &; Company , Realtors , temporarily prospered . " Charles 's partner at that time was Charles Small , brother-in-law of Nona Brooks , who later founded Divine Science , " remarks Freeman . The forces were gathering that early . In 1884 , the Fillmore family , now increased by two sons , moved to Kansas City , Missouri , then in the midst of a building boom . Charles Fillmore laid out a real-estate subdivision named Gladstone Heights which still stands . It includes Myrtle Avenue , named for his wife , and Norton Avenue , named for his wandering brother . Charles packed the family one summer and went prospecting for silver in Colorado . He found a vein , but it quickly petered out . Back in Kansas City , the real-estate boom collapsed ; simultaneously , Myrtle 's tuberculosis flared up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the medicine cabinet was always full to overflowing with pills and nostrums with which she was continually dosing herself and all the other members of the family . " Ever restless , the Fillmores attended lectures . One they turned out for was delivered by a student of a woman who had worked with Mary Baker Eddy . The lecturer 's main assertion buoyed Myrtle Fillmore 's hope . She was in the right place at the right time . " I am a child of God , " the lecturer announced , " and therefore I do not inherit sickness . " Myrtle , believer in pills and nostrums , discovered a new faith : that statement founded Unity . " It flashed upon me , " she wrote later , " that I might talk to the life in every part of my body and have it do just what I wanted . I began to teach my body and got marvelous results . " " In just two years , " writes Freeman , " Myrtle Fillmore was no longer an invalid . Through her prayers she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you will , Myrtle lived a long and healthy life . P eople heard of Myrtle 's miraculous healing and came to her for counsel . Charles was less easily convinced . " Although I was a chronic invalid and seldom free from pain , " he wrote later , " the doctrine did not at first appeal to me . " Two years later , finding the doctrine more appealing , Fillmore pub lished the first issue of a little magazine called Modern Thought , " Devoted to the Spiritualization of Humanity from an Independent Standpoint . " In the interim , his income had declined and a third child had been born . Modern Thought received a small number of love offerings and became Christian Science Thought , a more specific name . Papa Charley wrangled long with Mary Baker Eddy about his use of that then . generic term . Mrs. Eddy wanted to keep " Christiar . Science " for her exclusive use . Fillmore thought otherwise : " People of limited spiritual unfold ment , " he wrote in his magazine , " are sticklers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idols ... They quarrel over names , names , names , vapid , unmeaning names , that never were anything o themselves and do not even represent that whirl they allege to represent . " But he gave in to Mrs Eddy at last and lamely rechristened his magazine Thought . Quarrel over names who may , the Fillmore move ment still lacked one ? lacked what we might toda ? call brand identity . Charles generated the missin ; name out of a prayer meeting one night , when h and Myrtle and a circle of students had " gone int . the silence , " as they called meditation . Freeman rf captures the excitement : " That 's Of " he cried out . " UNrry ! " he told the others . " UNuri ! that 's the name for our work , the name we 've been looking for . " Later he told friends the name came right out of the ether , just as the voice of Jesus was heard by Paul in the heavens . " No one else heard it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken to me . " Fillmore 's revelation was fortuitous , even though led to a persistent confusion of the Unity mover-eel. with Unitarianism , with which it was never asst ciated and which it scarcely resembles . But Unity ? the merging of all religions , of all versions of Ne Thought , of science and faith , of theory and pra . Lice , of healing and help ? it is a label that slicks . Unity 's religious virtues , or lack of them , the Go of seasons and creeds must decide . Viewed see : larly , Unity resembles the many family business . which flourished in the Midwest from the late nin teenth century until after World War II , when mo of them merged with large national corporation and lost their identity . The structure of a fami business is the structure one would expect a Mi western businessman to give to a religious mov ment ; it was the only mode of organization he knew " This is not a business but a ministry , " Charl Fillmore insisted , but he kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , and concerned himself mightily with the qut tion of material prosperity , a question to which i forward-thinking Christians of the time gave her At the very beginning of the movement , Charles ar Myrtle wrote out a " Dedication and Covenant " wi God which reads like a contractual agreement ; was uncovered among some old papers in Unit : library in 1942 : IT le , Charles Fillmore and Myrtle Fillmore , husband and wife , hereby dedicate ourselves , our time , our money , all we have and all we expect to have , to the Spirit of Truth , and through it to the Society of Silent Unity . It being understood and also agreed that the said Spirit of Truth shall render unto us an equivalent for this dedication in peace of mind , health of body , wisdom , understanding , love , life , and an abundant supply of all things necessary to meet every want without our making any of these things the object of our existence . In the presence of the Conscious Mind of Christ Jesus , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Fillmore Myrtle Fillmore Unity 's archives today celebrate the School 's moves to successively larger quarters during the first decades of the twentieth century with the same proud and somewhat dusty nostalgia to he found in the gilded trophy rooms of Midwestern corporations . The moves culminated in the piecemeal purchase of a 1,400-acre tract of land outside Lee 's Summit , Missouri , which the Fillinores had the foresight to incorporate as a village , and so completely to control . Unity Village 's mayor today is Charles Fillmore , grandson of the founder and the Unity School 's chief executive officer . F aith girded with business ability was the Mid- 1 : west 's peculiar institution in the early years of the century . Young and usually dirt-poor entrepreneurs did not merely found businesses in those days ; they marched into prosperity with God and the people on their side . New Hampshire Baptist Russell Conwell bounced around the country to deliver his rousing lecture Acres of Diamonds more than six thousand times between 1377 and 1925 , and founded Temple University on the proceeds : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your duty to get rich . Many of my brethren say to me , " D0 you , a Christian minister , spend your time going up and down the country advising young people to get , rich , to get money ? " es , of course I do . They say , " Is n't that awful ! Why do n't you preach the gospel instead of preaching about man making money ? " Because to make money honestly is to preach the gospel . That is the reason . The men who get rich may be the most honest men you find in the community .... Money is power , and you should be reasonably ambitious to have it . You should because you can do more good with it than you could without it , Horatio Alger got the message , and so did Jay Cats-by , and so did Henry Ford . It still informs the American dream , and perhaps it is true . If faith can heal the body , then surely it can fill the pocket . And what else but faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striving for prosperity usually came a striving for gentility , a didactic commitment to raising the level of public taste . Walt Disney , battered son of a ne'er ? do ? well Missouri farmer , preserved nostalgia , clean living , and country kitsch on film and won the accolades of the nation 's urban intellectuals and the worship of its middle class . Joyce Hall , son of an itinerant Nebraska preacher and founder of Hallmark Cards , who never graduated from high school , won honorary doctorates from three Midwestern universities for printing polite expressions of regard on decorated paper and thereby expressing the social emotions of millions of Americans : today half of all personal mail moved in the United States consists of greeting cards . The common ingredients of Disney 's and Hall 's products ? slickness and corn , politeness and geniality ? are ingredients of Unity 's products as well . Disney Productions and Hallmark Cards are extraordinary successes , Unity only a modest success , but the name of the game is still the same : packaging . And not Disney , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation , were ever cynical about the products they manufactured . Prayer as product : it was Charles Fillmore 's most brilliant invention . Prayer requires no raw materials . It can be sent in measured quantities by ordinary mail , across a telephone circuit. , through a wire . It can be transmitted like radio waves across the invisible ether , without generating equipment . Unity considers it priceless , and does not charge for its production . Those who receive it also consider it priceless , but usually put a price on its effects and remit promptly . Its models need not be changed more than once every fifty years or so , to reflect changes in the language . It does not wear out , needs no special handling , never goes out of style . It is , depending on boo . it is formulated , a medicine , a service , an investment . And it is tax-deductible . As Disney did with character and Hallmark does with sentiment , Unity has done with prayer : categorized all the many varieties so that they may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion and human need . For years , Unity answered most written prayer requests with form letters supplying standard words of assurance and standard prayers for each correspondent 's problem . With the advent of computer technology , Unity is now able to personalize those form letters . An IBM 360 computer system buzzes in its air-conditioned hive on the first floor of the Silent Unity building , and helps Unity pray at six hundred lines a minute . " The bread-and-butter operation for our computer , " says young Charles Fillmore , " is subscription fulfillment , which seems to be a natural use of our computer . The computer also helps us answer our correspondence . Formerly we answered much of it with form letters , but now we can write personalized letters ? actually serve the correspondent better with prayer requests than before . We 're not answering prayers with computers . We still have people . The computer does n't read the- letters ? ' Garbage in , garbage out , ' as the saying goes . Formerly it was just ' Dear Friend . ' Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' It 's working real well . It 's giving better service . " The computer may not read the letter , but an organization which believes that thoughts can fly might soberly consider the power for good stored in the Unity 360 's electromagnetic interior . if Christianity had ever adopted the prayer wheel , American ingenuity would certainly , at this late date , have harnessed it to the dentist 's turbine . and believers everywhere would be flipping messages heavenward at a round 300,000 revolutions per minute . Unity , a " here-and-now religion , " as Freeman describes it , approaches that accomplishment . No doubt its computer serves . nity 's formula for Practical Christianity re- solves most of traditional Christianity 's paradoxes , and makes believing easy . Unity is not a separate denomination but a nonsectarian institu ? tion a " school " of faith . It proclaims no special beliefs , but only what it calls " Truth , " which seems to include the irreducible essences of several major religions . " We feel that we do n't have a truth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you dig deeply enough , " says J. Sig Paulson , director of World Unity and resident minister at Unity Village , a rangy , athletic man who used to be in the wholesale lumber business in Seattle . " Our idea is to take the message to the individual . We do n't care if he goes to church or not as long as he applies it to his daily life . We have no creed or doctrine that anyone has to subscribe to . " Which would seem tu leave Unity with no outlines at all , but that is not the case . In its many books and pamphlets , Unity defines itself as an organization which believes in man as God . evolving toward his destiny of immortality and perfection . " We do n't believe that man is originally a depraved , sinful creature , " continues Paulson . " The only reason he 's capable of sin is the fact that he 's a god . A dog could n't sin . just by being a dog , or a cow by being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just because of the potential that he has . We feel that man has never discovered his potential just as he 's never discovered the potential of the universe in which he lives . Atomic energy is a fairly recent discovery but it 's been here for a long time . Why , there 's enough atomic energy in My little finger to light up Kansas City for years . if we only knew how to harness it . Man has to expand his consciousness . The real expansion comes from within . " Freeman is more succinct : " Unity says that evil is unreal ? like cold . like dark . The only reality is the good . " The writings of Charles and Myrtle Fillmore do not lend themselves to debate . " I told the life in my liver that it was not torpid or inert , but full of vigor and energy , " Myrtle wrote of her first healing experience . " I told the life in my Stomach that it was not weak or inefficient , but energetic , strong . and intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no longer infested with ignorant thoughts of disease . put there by myself and my doctors , but that it was all athrill with the sweet , pure , wholesome energy of God .... 1 went to all the life centers in my body and spoke words of Truth to them ? words of strength and power . And neither did I forget to tell them that they were free , unlimited Spirit . I told them that they were no longer in bondage to the carnal mind ; that they were not corruptible flesh , but centers of life and energy omnipresent . " Charles was not content merely in heal his body , perhaps because he found himself unable to do so , though he did discard his stacked shoe and minimized his limp as the years went on . " I spent several hours every day in this process of talking to parts of his body and I found that I was releasing electronic forces sealed up in the nerves . This I have done for nearly fifty years until now I have what may be termed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is even more than electric and when certain spiritual emotions are impartec to it it fairly glows and blends with an omnipresen etheric atmosphere that is highly charged with energy . My physical organism is being transformer cell by cell , and the ultimate will be an entirely new body having all the perfections of youth in additiol to ethereal life . " Charles decided he would attemp not to die , and he lived to be ninety-four . He die ( in his old body , so far as the records show . Unity 's continuing popularity does not depent on Myrtle 's vigorous liver or Charles 's etheric trans formations , but their writings reveal how mud more experimental ? is that the right word ? ? wer their ideas than are those of the Unity movemen as an institution . Ilnity 's blandness is nearly uniqu among religious movements . One must look to put veyors of emollients such as Norman Vincent Peal to find any parallels , and he acknowledged his de/ to Unity several years ago in a celebrated publi pilgrimage to Lee 's Summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a successful mass product . with affirmativ prayers the strings that tic up the package . Thes from a recent issue of Daily Word : " I RELAX AN ENTER INTO AND ENJOY EVERY MOMENT OF TUTS DA ' I THINK THOUGHTS OF PLENTY , AND I AM PROSPEREI MY VISION IS CLEAR AND UNCLOUDED , MY MIND OPEN TO NEW IDEAS . " Like horoscopes , Unity 's pra. ers offer a series of abstractions into which mo people can read their personal problems . Astrol gists learned to construct these bubbles of ahstra tion long ago , but astrology 's reference system largely outside Christianity , and thus lacks tl stamp of authenticity which is Unity 's seal of a proval . With Unity , whatever your faith , the inte faces will match , and you also may enter in . Unity 's healing messages offer special compens Lion to victims of psychosomatic afflictions , i while the ill pray among the parts of their hod they also have the pleasure of thinking about the parts at delicious length ? " carnal mind " or rti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constipation and mental tensity in some form are so closely connected , the remedy is : Let go . Imagine yourself in a condition of perfect relaxation . Perfect relaxation can be produced by thinking and speaking relaxing thoughts and words . .5'ay to your bowels : You now open and let go , as I open and let go that which I hold in my consciousness . Cleanliness is next to godliness at Unity Village , ritually and in fact . The printing plant , proudly pointed out to visitors , is the cleanest in Christendom . All mail is subjected to a series of ritual cleansings as it is processed . Workers bless the incoming mail , bless each individual letter as it is opened . bless the love offerings as they are gathered together , and bless the responses Unity mails out . Callers are blessed the moment Unity answers the phone , as if they needed disinfection ; workers are blessed by the management several times a day , as if their faith might otherwise flag ; and the problems of sinners who contact Unity receive heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamma radiation that should crisp them like cancer cells . Yet Charles Filimore 's body still moved with a limp , and the atomic energy in Sig Paulson 's little finger has not yet illuminated the Midwest for even a millisecond . The ritual cleansing goes on , as it must in an organization which denies the corporeal so vehemently , for the corporeal still writhes despite all denials , still smells as ripe and suffers as much ? as Unity people have occasion , in the welter of mail , to know . If Unity , on one level , is a helpful and successful tract society and night-care center , on another it must he considered a dismal failure , an experiment in tapping the energy of the universe that failed . But in all fairness , so must Christianity . P hysically , Unity Village baroquely displays its founders ' preoccupations . Most of the buildings on the 1400-acre tract were designed by Waldo Rickert Fillmore , called Rick , son of the founders and the most sublimated of the Filimores . Rick wanted to be an artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chicago Art Institute and in Europe , and returned to Kansas City to become an interior decorator before going home to Unity Village and making its physical elaboration his life work . Rick 's was a decorative architecture , an architecture of stage sets hiding practical functions . He experimented , he tinkered , he tried out new materials and disguised old ones . What was once farmland became , at his hands , an ornate park , laid out in the manner of nineteenth-century English estates with sheds and barns disguised as peasant cottages , with quaint bridges and wandering paths , a hodgepodge of Cotswold outbuildings and Italian Renaissance halls . The balustrades that line Unity 's walks look , from a distance , like old stone , but in fact they were molded of stained concrete with pits and cracks made by mixing clay into the wet concrete and washing it out when the concrete set . Walls of pink sandstone are really concrete dyed to match . Unity 's fountains spray all summer , serving as decoration and as cooling units for the air-conditioning system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 feet high , disguises a 55,000-gallon water tank . In the tower , the most masculine of Unity 's appurtenances , Rick had his studio until his death in 1965 . Visiting Unity Village today , more than a decade after Rick built his last building , one sees signs of decay . The concrete shales off the sidewalks ; the back of the administration building , which Rick never finished , sports a stained dry wall ; the toast is stale in Unity 's once-popular vegetarian cafeteria . " We serve regular food in the cafeteria now , " says young Charles with a hint of impatience . " The vegeterian business gave us a kooky image ? though you can still get a completely vegetarian meal there if you want one . " The Arches , a picturesque home where Charles and Myrtle Fillmore lived , is occupied by a family of Unity workers . Myrtle refused to allow a kitchen installed in the Arches when Rick built it , despite her husband 's pleadings ; Papa Charley 's mother , come down from her log cabin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family cooking . Presumably the Arches has a kitchen now . Yet Unity Village is pleasant to walk in , with apple orchards and a golf course , a private lake , a swimming pool that looks like a Roman bath , lodges and cottages and a wealth of trees . A successful Sunday afternoon in Kansas City used to include a drive to the country to buy a jar of Unity honey and a jug of Unity cider , the only cider available near town that was n't pasteurized . Honey is still for sale at the information center in the base of the tower , and cider in season at a stand across the road . Charles Fillmore , Rick 's son , grandson of the founder , executive vice president and chief executive officer , a man in his forties , occupies an office directly inside Unity 's elaborately carved front door . A mounted copy of Daily Word glows on his desk ; a golf trophy tees off on the bookcase behind him . Like his father Rick , Charles is a stocky , heavily built man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer , and with a farmer 's surprising mixture of hesitancy and self-confidence . And toughness. when he talked to me of Unity 's competition and changing programs . " The Reverend Oral Roberts came up here with his staff and studied our Daily Word , and six months later God told Oral Roberts to publish a devotional magazine and it 's just like Daily Word except that the Bible verse appears at the bottom of each page instead of at the top . Well , we do n't mind . " My grandfather was a very practical idealist , " young Charles continues . " He always wanted to test things out and see that they worked . He was a human being and he certainly was n't infallible and did n't claim to be . He was n't one to go off into the wilderness and spend his life in prayer and meditation . The movement does n't either , although some of us thought there were signs we were leaning that way . We recently cut the hedge out here , for example , which was pretty symbolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one time . " My grandfather Charles Fillmore was ahead of the particular metaphysical thought of his lime . However , we 've been caught up with , and this is good . He wanted to open up religious thought and let some ventilation in ? ' blow some minds ' ! But his followers , despite his wishes , as dedicated followers are wont to do , wanted to deify him ? if Charles Fillmore did n't write it or say it then let 's not bother with it . It had a certain crystallizing effect on the movement , As Eric Butterworth puts it , if we in Unity just settle for Charles Fillmore 's legacy , we will have failed him . He believed in truth being progressively revealed . We came to a point where we were pretty self-satisfied . Our membership got older , grew more slowly . It was slow but steady , but not in proportion to the growth made during Charles Fillmore 's ministry . Our field ministry leveled off in the mid-Fifties . We found that more and more of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization for a growing number of Unity churches and we asked ourselves one day if this was really our purpose . We say we 're a nondenominational organization . Charles Fillmore would n't even hold his classes on Sunday in the early days so that he would n't compete with organized churches . This School was set up not to convert anybody but to try to disseminate a helpful spiritual viewpoint to people in need . " So we put it to our churches . We said , ' Well . listen , we 're trying to be a cutting edge here in the forefront of metaphysical thought , trying to go beyond what our heritage is from our founders . We 're trying to reach out to find new and better ways to get in harmony with this universe we live in . ' So they formed their own organization , the Association of Unity Churches . " We 're glad to have them , of course . and glad to help , but we 're trying to get back to our real purposes . I believe that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of students ourselves . You know what can happen with church organizations ? power struggles , that sort of thing . " U nity 's growth slowed during the very years when the largest number of Americans moved to the city . Growth has picked up under the practical hand of young Charles , a graduate of the University of Missouri 's School of Journalism . Having all but severed Unity 's ties with its Centers , he has recentralized the School 's power and authority , but he has not acquired a serious professional staff to move the School ort . The evidence of Disney Productions and Hallmark Cards is that the founder 's faith must be replaced by the professional 's skill . Except for a few Unity staff members who are slowly acquiring D.Ed . degrees at local universities , and one attending a theological seminary in Chicago , the Unity staff appears stagnant . And perhaps , with its continuing commitment to the personal belief of each worker in Truth , Unity can not adapt itself to a world where packaging is at least as important as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless make the attempt . We all learned to he nice , years ago , as nice as Charles and Myrtle Fillmore hoped we would be : out of that niceness the United States is now emerging to confront the ugly problems which gentility disguised . Unity has never confronted its own co tradictions ; symbolically enough , its beacon rig shines not from its tower , where the light beloim but from a low and feminine building sheltered I hind the tower , a building that appropriately hous Silent Unity . Today the tower peels with disu and Rick Fillmore 's studio is shut up . The inform tion center in the base sells honey and tracts . But the tower is empty now , and when y emerge at its open observation floor on a fog day it seems to occupy a rarefied and spirited spa of its own . You can barely see the Unity School Practical Christianity far below , pastel through t mist . The scene recalls DeMille versions of heavy fog pumping out of dry-ice machines . dialog lofty , he-man actors wearing gossamer wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activit below . because you do not approach the railir around the tower 's edge , amid the leftover wiri of Christmas lights , without understanding the d Lance that you could fall . The fog itself is more st stantial than the gentle words that drift these di from Unity ; it is water vapor , and they are me physics , less than motes of sunlight , which at le imply black night . Unity 's affirmative faith , its belief in God 's teriority , requires of its students a terrible den of self , for if it is not oneself inside there suffen and sinning , if to give up sin one must give oneself and find merely God lurking in the corn of one 's liver and the passageways of one 's bow , then one sacrifices the very thing Christianity I promised , almost alone among the world 's religio the persistence of individual identity ; the privil , of personal existence now and through all tit Unity students pay a price for their faith in loss identity . Perhaps they do not consider that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mha to bloom and affirmations to ring ; Myrtle Filimc gentle with people and generous with love : b made heavens on earth . They were rewarded in I portion : their followers recognized their liappir and , happiness being the rare commodity it is , p generously to be near it in spirit and in flesh was a sideshow of sorts , the progress through of Charles and Myrtle Fillmore , the snowy-hair handsome man , the snowy-haired , lovely womai sideshow where the maimed crowded in to see perfect , for despite their physical afflictions , Fillmores deserved their places above the cro Myrtle was a saint , Charles a crazy genius , they got on in life by doing exactly what it plea them , within their intellectual and spiritual ions , to do . That era of Unity 's developmen over ; the lights have been taken down ; and Unity is left with itself . So far it has found no : purpose that can match , in glamour or in seri , ness , the old . Better to have an electronic body t a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its cult of normalcy . Unity has g pedestrian . One can only hope that the found schizophrenia may be inherited somewhere d , the line . The world has need of such wackiness.
