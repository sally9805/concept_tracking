txt As President Nixon 's counsel for congressional relations , Clark MacGregor entertains congressmen for breakfast , lunch , and dinner , races up to Capitol Hill almost every day , and also confers by phone and at the big round table in his White House office . What does he expect to accomplish ? First of two articles based on an interview . One of Clark MacGregor 's most taxing jobs as chief White House liaison man with Congress is to bend or blunt the legislative drives of the majority Democrats . How to derail congressiOnal efforts to set a Dec. 31 , 1971 , cutoff date for the Vietnam war is high on the list . Mr. MacGregor now expects " the Dec. 31 , 1971 , date would be amended or otherwise changed before it comes ? to a vote .. . to probably the end of the next fiscal year , June 30 , 1972 . " Critics of Mr. Nixon 's Vietnam policies " would make that move , I think , in order to try and win additional votes , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for extension if the prisoners of war had not been released . " He also would anticipate the resolution would have an escape hatch if a take-over of the Saigon government by the Communists was threatened . ' Endorsement ' seen What Mr. MacGregor was describing would be , in effect , a congressional endorsement of Mr. Nixon 's present policy of keeping a residual force in South Vietnam until the POWs are released and the South Vietnamese Government is strengthened through the Vietnamization program . It is close to the best possible solution the administration can hope for in terms of congressional action . Mr. MacGregor 's role is to promote such an outcome to counter the strong support in Congress for a simple cutoff date of Dec , 31 , 1971  --  or not too long thereafter . Mr , MacGregor does not have an exact scenario on how this very difficult task would be accomplished , But he is confident " a straight Dec. 31 , 1971 , cutoff would . not win a majority of either the Senate or the House . " // *Nixon 's salesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to an initial question on whether he had done any head counting on the vote , Complaints recalled Before Mr. MacGregor  --  a Wisconsin representative who was defeated in a bid for a Senate seat by Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey  --  became a White House counsel on Jan. 5 , many congressmen , both Republicans and Democrats , complained that the White House was out of touch with congressional realities . In part , this was due to partisanship  --  a Democratic Congress vs . L. , a Republican President  --  and the friction caused by differing responsibilities under the Constitution . But /President Nixon recognized the need for reformation in everyday relations with Congress , and Mr. MacGregor was his answer . On domestic issues , the handling of the black congressmen , all Democrats , who finally got in to see Mr. Nixon in March after petitioning him for more than a year , is one measure of a changed attitude in the White House . The black caucus presented some 60 demands to the President and asked for a reply by May 17 . In the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' two weeks ago had lunch with Rep. Charles C. Diggs Jr. , chairman of the caucus ; John W. Dean III , top staff man for the caucus : and Robert J. Brown , a black who is a special assistant to the President . No one is expecting the White House replies to satisfy the black caucus . But Mr. MacGregor is obviously doing his part to keep the dialogue on a higher level than before . Another contrast with the pre-MacGregor days is the regular weekly schedule of visiting hours Mr. MacGregor has on Capitol Hill for senators and representatives . " Every Tuesday I 'm in Senator Scott 's the minority leader Capitol office from roughly 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. where there 's an open-door policy for any senator who wants to see me about a problem . And this is widely known in the Senate , " Mr. MacGregor explains . On Wednesday , the same procedure takes place on the House side in the Capitol office of Rep. Gerald R. Ford , Republican minority leader in the House . Time factor considered 's secretary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And sometimes he 'll come in and be there for only 3 minutes . " Mr. MacGregor 's predecessor did some- AP Photo Clark MacGregor Keeping the White House in touch with realities . thing like this for a while , but it was given up because it was too time consuming , not sufficiently productive , or Mr. Harlow ( Bryce N. Harlow , presidential counsel ) thought he could accomplish his purposes in other ways . According to Mr. MacGregor ? " I think we probably have expanded the number and type of contact formats between the President and senior White House staff personnel on one hand and senators and House members on the other . " Some of the new ones are fairly regular breakfast meetings in some of which the President joins , some of which are related specifically to a legislative problem where we invite House and Senate members generally favorable toward the administration who have some troubles with certain aspects of some of the President 's legislative proposals .
