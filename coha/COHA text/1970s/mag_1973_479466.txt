THE DEBATERS ? neraclittis , Par-menides , and Pythagoras ? are seated on the altar of the church of Saint Germain-des-Pres . Behind them , a great mural depicts Christ , Aphrodite , and Orpheus in an endless odyssey . Noani Chorrisky- , Claude Utvi-Strauss , and R. D. Laing sit in the audience , each in his separate pew . Overhead , V-2 rockets and B25 bombers pass each other en route to their respective targets , and across the street at the Deux Magots , Yankee sailors , fascists , physicists , paranoiacs , highwaymen , and Maltese nationalists practice alchemy by stealing each other 's mail . The synapse that connects them all is misshapen , horrifying . apocalyptic , clumsy , and , above ail . ambitious . The synapse functions as a great tent , the unifying element of a circus that floats up and back across centuries , transcending its audiences , amusing them to death before it moves on , always featuring the sameacts , changing only the costumes . The performance is an orgy , and every performer is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commentary , speaking through a post horn , assuring the audience that the grotesque wonders within the tent prove the existence of the world outside . There are some jokes under the tent , many of them in the form of comic names : Genghis Cohen , Benny Profane , Geli , Slothrop , Scheissvogel , Roger Mexico , Stencil , Mafia , Winsome , Charisma , Oedipa , and a rock group called the Volkswagens . Almost all of the names are also clues , for the form of the show is a search , a mystery in which everyone wears a mask that must be removed to reveal the object of the search . As the show progresses , the ringmaster provides clues to the clues , increasing the tension with the stripping away of each new mask . Because the performers wear masks , the circus can have no other structure ; the masks rather than the performers interact , the ringmaster presides over everything , omnipotent , capricious , possessed of a seemingly preternatural intelligence . To make the show more interesting . the ringmaster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repaints the masks during the intermission , implying that beyond metempsychosis. which Chomsky , Levi-Strauss , and Descartes might explain through the existence of structures in the mind , there is a kind of schizophrenia of sanity , the territory of Laing . The show belongs to Thomas Pynchon , master of fact , cataloguer of mythology , genius of the arcane history of man . In his new novel , Graeity 's Rainbow , Mr. Pynchon has found an ending for the show , one that has no earthly sequel . Mr. Shouts , a contributing editor of Harper 's , is currently at work on his third novel , The Prodigy . Perhaps the readers of his earlier novels should have expected such an ending , knowing that he views the human situation as a grand and terrible subject , as deep as myth and as broad as dreaming . His novels ridicule the concept of invention ; they toy with our perception of what he calls preterition , the holes of memory that disable the present ; they cast doubt on every human act . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment , religious and therefore despairing of this world . With each novel he darkens and enlarges the cloud he casts . One wonders why he bothers to speak at all . It is the same question that must be asked of any Jeremiah . What is the force that impels them to the lonely act ? We live , we speak , Beckett might answer ; what other choice is available to us ? We also read , and Mr. Pynchon makes that pleasure into a task . The man is nearly deaf , he has some sort of vendetta against the simple stage direction of dialogue " he said , " and he writes in spasms . It is a brave effort , this seeking of one 's own pulse and daring to hew to it , but the pulse Mr. Pynchon has found is not a rhythm that sweeps us up into it : he writes in the most bruising , hobbling prose style this side of a German philosopher . A Calvinist doggedness is required to read all 760 pages of Gravity 's Rainbow . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him English English too , heaven MOWS why , and it keeps corning out like Cary Grant " that Jerry ? old Jerry . you know ? has been in that The Hague there , shooting his bloody rockets at that London , a-and using , the ... Royal Dutch Shell headquarters building , at the Joseph Israel-plein if I remember correctly , jor a radio guidance transmitter ? " The pity is that Mr. Pynchon 's stylistic goals are admirable ; he is searching for the same complex imitations of complexity that Joyce , Proust , Faulkner , and now William Gass use so beautifully . There is no reason to think that he will not soon succeed . The man is only thirty-five years old , and the language of each of his novels is more interesting than the last . In a writer of less intelligence , the stylistic flaws would be fatal ? imagine John Kenneth Galbraith 's ideas in Marx 's style . There is no danger of that with Mr. Pynchon . The structure of V. , published when he was only twenty-six years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzle of the title is Venus , but not merely Venus as she was known in one place and time . V. is Venus moving westward and forward in time , Venus in all of her incarnations : Asherah , Asteroth , Astarte , Isis , Urania , and Aphrodite . V. is the Venus of love and desire , the goddess of rape , incest , adultery , ritual prostitution , bearded here , armed there , protectress of sailors , the Phoenician creature the Hebrews called Shame . Venus and her variations are the structure of the novel ; the search for her is the plot . But Pynchon is a wily satirist ; the question of the identity of V. , the revealing of variation after variation on his palimpsest , takes place during two generations , wanders the world , and picks apart much of the foolishness of modern America . The fascination of the novel , like the fascination of Venus herself , is irresistible . One arrives at the Louvre for the first time , knowing that she is there , ready to scoff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibition rooms are preparation , the marble is cool and the light is gray . There is an urge to touch the features of the philosophers , to have that connection with the Golden Age . The guards are there , those fifty-centime crusts in black wrappings , born to interfere . The Golden Age passes into a final room . It is crowded with tourists and children stamping their passports with the sight of her on a pedestal . Evanescent styles , lacquered hair , aesthetic blindness , the dampness of stupidity fill the room . She is turned today to catch the light along her right side . Stumps , cracks , chips , a stone . that 's all she is . And then there is a fantasy of touching one 's lips to the elegance of her hack , a certainty that her breasts are not stone , the desire to feel her breath , to experience the smoothness of her promise . She wills her worshippers into love . It is the Venus that Thomas Pyncho n knows so well . It is the population around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venus one forgives her flaws . So it is with the novel ; the idea overcomes the lack of character , the callow jokes , the Procrustean shoes that pinch at every other step , the unsteady tone . Venus saves the novel . She is the only truly realized character , and she was there in our minds before she took up with Benny Profane the sailor , or Benny went hunting alligators in the sewers of New York , or Stencil went to Malta , or Ayn Rand or materialism or phony Bohemianism or war or politics were ridiculed . S V. IS IN ONE SENSE a novel o East Coast lunacy in the 1950s , Pynchon 's second novel , The Crying of Lot 49 , is an exploration of West Coast lunacy in the 1960s . It is a brief work , more direct than either of the others , and it has a character , Oedipa Maas , who is drawn with sufficient life to give the novel a line of progress in its own time . There are some carry-overs from V. : The Kazoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though we are spared Mr. Pynchon 's borrowing from the Greek in connection with the Yo-Yoapocheir t a combination of away and hand , used in V. as a pun on aphelion ) . The one important aspect of The Crying of Lot 49 that does not appear in either of the other novels is that we care not only about Oedipa 's search for the paranoid post-horn gang , we care about Oedipa herself . She is human , an eviscerated Cabfornian falling into the cavity of herself , finding in the floating debris around her nothing solid enough to hold her up . The success of the novel resides in the possibility of the reader experiencing a parallel to Oedipa ; seeking the unknowable as she does , tinkering with the dark places of the mind that lie in wait for one in a state of islands , technology , paranoia , drugs , cash culture , and the fearful inability to admit the existence of the resolutions of responsibility , age , or death . It is a terrifying novel . There are few other places in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even Beckett is overshadowed here , for he lacks California as a prop . Even 13cckett can not give us the anguish of a woman married to a former used-car salesman who has become in his middle years a Top Forty disc jockey and an eater of hallucinogens . There is no better guidebook to the society that has grown up in California , no more fierce admonition against getting lost in its mores . G RAVITY 'S RAINBOW , the gigantic resolution of his circus sub specie aeternitatis , proceeds , like all of Mr. Pynchon 's novels , on several levels and is superficially organized around a search , this time for a German rocket . The novel begins in England during the last days of World War II . Buzz bombs have been replaced by the terrifying V-2 rockets that fly faster than sound , announcing themselves by their explosions . The book follows a group of English , American , German , African , and Russian scientists , soldiers , mystics , fools , crooks , perverts , victims , and children through the search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been launched or even completed before the German surrender . The incidents that move the plot are unrelievedly horrible ; simple deceit is the kindest act in the novel , the ugliest depravity is its routine ; a Hebrew prophet could not paint a worse or more didactic picture . Gravity 's Rainbow is as ambitious as The Divine Comedy , but it unfortunately lacks the grace , clarity , and loving commitment to true imagination that makes art of Dante 's work . Perhaps the world is too old and too complex for great works of imagination to be made . Perhaps a modern Dante would find the naming of Purgatory and Hell an infringement on the copyright of history and be limited to satire and senseless mysticism . Mr. Pvnchon would seem to say so ; he has become a philosopher of the worn- ? ut world , an implier of entropy , a pitchman for the comedy of death . At the core of his work is the notion of a layered culture ? the palimpsest is his metaphor ? in which each new variation is written over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then passes through the variations , adding his own work as the latest , perhaps the last , layer . The result is not a wholeness achieved through continuity , but a line of shards , the last of which contains the apocalyptic atom . Hcraclitus wrote the original parchment on which Gravity 's Rainbow is superimposed . The novel is made of strife , seeming to agree with Heraclitus that everything lives by the death of something else and that the end of strife is also the end of the world . But it is a novel based mainly on the Orpheus myth . Parmenides ' answer to Heraclitus , the solid sphere of " it is , " provides the philosophical tension . The resolution is perhaps a victory for I lerarlitus or the promise that the Pythagorean harmony of opposites will follow in a messianic future . Man , as conceived in Gravity 's Rainbow , is the creature known to Orphism ; he has eaten the ashes of the Titans , punishment awaits him in the Netherworld of a universe born of Night . One may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , the end of the terrible transmigrations in the freedom that comes after purification . The Orpheus of the novel finds the Underworld by descending through a toilet . He chases the secret rocket from England to France to Germany . As Orpheus belongs to Apollo and Dionysus , the hero of Mr. Pynchon 's novel is a mathematician and mouth-organ player and a lover of drunkenness and sex . In his journeys up and back from the Netherworld he not only encounters most of the Greek Pantheon but ranges across Babylonian astrology and Hebrew myth , sails on a ship called the Anubis for an Egyptian weighing of the hearts of the dead , meets himself in Rilke 's version of the Orpheus myth , gives us reason to think of the twins of Mani 's vision , and manages to find entrance to Christianity through the ravages of science gone berserk . The characters range from Hansel and Gretel to Hades , from the Titans to the Erinyes , from General Electric and I. G. Farhen to Athena . Incarnations mix and fade ; the palimpsest is fluid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization evolve , for we are the society of history and accumulation , an idea that Mr. Pynchon has caught exactly . In arriving at that exposition of Western civilization , the author demonstrates his astonishing erudition and ability to integrate ideas , but in so doing he sacrifices the novel . What is left is a comic tour of the history of Western thought , a history that finally overwhelms even Mr. Pynchon and leads his novel to a soggy end . It could not be otherwise ; the time is too late for cosmogonies . Men have walked on the moon , teaching us that it is not the silver egg of Night from which Eros was hatched ; mysticism is a hideout for fools . Mr. Pynchon thinks otherwise . In his search for the mysterious rocket , Tyrone Slothrop moves from Poisson distributions in London and crackpot science at a former mental hospital outside the city to orgiastic sex on the French Riviera . THEY seem always to be menacing him , menacing all of us . Everything is suspicion ? spies and counterspies and counter-counterspies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with black marketeers , contests the Russians to see who will discover the secret of the rocket . Meanwhile , we learn about the rocket , piece by piece , one agonizing clue at a time , as the evil nature of man is revealed : the monstrous Kees ? , torturer of sweet Gottfried ; Tchtcherine , the Russian brother of the black African Enzian who leads Germany ' s black rocket corps ; Greta , the film star and mother of little erotic Bianca , who is revealed in the dream of a Japanese officer ; and Katie , the inconsistent EurydiceGretel . Pavlovian theory , plastics technology , rocket science , and a vision of motion picture film as world metaphor are presented to us along with racial , political , and economic theory . There are comic moments , funny names . The plotting is marvelously intricate , but there are no characters to give us an experience of the novel : we follow shadows to their conclusion . After 760 ingenious pages , the rocket is explained . Then we are told that we are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall not endure apocalypse alone . Coming with us is the gentle one , he who has been scourged by incarnate evil . It is Gott God I fried ( peace I . That is the revelation and the resolution of Gravity 's Rainbow , the culmination of the brilliantly intricate enormity of the construction , the final coruscation of the grotesque synapse . The world is ended , a thought of considerable magnitude but not of any great immediacy . Other prob terns , duties press : dinner or Vietnam , a child refusing neglect , Nixonian compassion , evening 's breath entering through an open window , an unsettled tooth . The novel is a disappointment ; circus is not really drama ; and the clowns of Mr. Pynchon 's circus arc not truly funny . It can only be concluded that the form of his humor is a deceit , a pose , yet another of the masks he manufactures . Of course we laugh , but it is dire comedy ; we laugh from uneasiness , hoping to save ourselves , to avoid his sneer by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as art , but Mr. Pynchon 's work fails beyond that , for it allows us the luxury of cruelty and it lures us into smugness by being a puzzle , a game of Botticelli at which only the most literate can play . The novel skates along the macrocosm but fails to touch the limits of the universe ; they are perhaps more easily reached through the inspection of a single point from which lines may emanate that touch infinity 's curve . Even if it is dreamed , the world must be made of things , beginning at some point . So novels are made of chapters , paragraphs , sentences , words . It is there , in the words , that Mr. Pynchon 's novels falter : the earlier novels lack things , the new novel has its things in lists . In neither case do the things have flesh , and without flesh there can not be character . ERHAPS IT IS THE GENRE that fails , perhaps hopeless and haughty satire can be no more than Mr. Pynchon has made of it . Great art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we are resurrected by it . Satire leaves us the less for having read it . We laugh and inflate ourselves , rising like eighteenth-century balloonists on a bubble of superheated air , adoring the view from the heavens . Nothing has been made ; the most brilliant satire is still an assertion of the world as it is , for it is dependent upon the masks we have already assigned , a confirmation of our prejudices . Satire holds no promise ; it is to the world as criticism is to art . Both satire and criticism have their functions , but only art and the world can stand by themselves , facing each other in profound opposition . The novel of satire is no more than a road map , full of sym bols , an accurate guide to the explored world , a Baedeker , an amusing preachment , even a commandment . For all of its inventions , Mr. Pynchon 's work lacks imagination : it is never more than an argument with the world . The art of fiction demands more .
