The view from Staff Writer Chris Byron 's office window is truly inspiring-if , that is , he happens to be writing about his favorite subject , energy . Byron has an unobstructed vista of the Manhattan headquarters of Exxon Corp. , one of the world 's richest industrial enterprises and perennial Most Valuable Player in the high-stakes game of international oil , the subject of this week 's cover story . With help from Reporter-Researchers Lydia Chavez and Charles Alexander , Byron dissects the maddeningly complex , increasingly contentious process by which oil is discovered , delivered , refined , priced , taxed and , in too many cases , wasted . <P> Byron has been trying to understand that process for much of his career . A graduate of Yale and Columbia Law , he joined TIME in 1971 and reported from Bonn and London , often about business and energy , before becoming a New York-based writer two years ago . " I hear the same solutions proposed , and the same complaining I heard five years ago , " he says of the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressing moviethe same scenes , the same actors and the same script . " <P> New York Correspondent John Tompkins , who reported extensively for a TIME cover story on Exxon in 1974 , interviewed Exxon executives and other oil gamesters for this week 's story , and found the situation markedly changed . " I did n't realize five years ago that I was seeing the end of an era , " he says . " Oilmen then were still somewhat fat and happy , confident that they 'd surmount the energy crisis . " This time , Tompkins saw the oil chiefs as " sadder , thinner and less optimistic . " <P> Writer Byron , convinced that Americans are the " true villains who waste depletable resources , " has embarked upon his own conservation scheme . Last fall , just before he wrote a TIME story on what he calls " forest power , " Byron installed two woodburning stoves in his Connecticut home . The move , he reports , " took $1,000 off my winter heating fuel bill . " Tompkins , who lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper alternative energy source for him , but does keep in touch with some relatives in Arizona who are building solar homes . That , says Tompkins , gazing out his office window at the Exxon building and a forest of other high-rise spires reaching toward the sun , just might be one way to win the oil game .
