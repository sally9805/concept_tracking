Selling a Client 's Story Bill Boyd is a Texas lawyer who recently acquired an infamous client : Charles Watson , a local boy from Boyd 's home town of McKinney who is a star suspect in the bizarre Sharon Tate murder case . Soon after Watson was arrested in McKinney , where he is now fighting extradition to California , the country lawyer revealed some big-city traits . As swarms of reporters begged for jailhouse interviews with his client , Boyd began dropping ten-gallon hints that Watson 's family might go along - " if the offer is substantial . " <P> One photographer offered $1,800 . " We need lots and lots of money , " retorted Boyd . How much ? " About $50,000 , " said the lawyer . Though the press balked , Boyd still has not lowered his client 's price-and he is quite sure that eventually he will get it . <P> Boyd 's fund-raising effort is a prime example of a growing phenomenon in notorious criminal cases : more and more lawyers try to make sure of collecting their fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie rights to their clients ' stories . Unfortunately , the roles of legal defender and literary agent may be in conflict . <P> Special lnvestigator . A defense lawyer commonly has his client 's permission to keep any journalist he chooses from , visiting the client in jail . Making those who do get in pay for the privilege is a handy way to finance heavy trial costs . In a case like Charles Watson 's , for example , it may cost more than $50,000 to muster witnesses , print appeals and the like . Some legal realists argue that the practice thus serves justice-in a way . But it also can create the spectacle of overly ambitious lawyers attempting to serve themselves . <P> Lawyers for Sirhan Sirhan , Robert Kennedy 's assassin , negotiated a contract with Writer Robert Kaiser . To help Kaiser cover the court proceeding , they agreed to assign him to the case as a " special investigator . " This allowed him not only to interview Sirhan in his cell , but also to examine evidence before the trial and talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other reporters . Given such access , Kaiser has produced a vividly detailed book-and Sirhan 's 50% share of the royalties may well pay his legal costs . <P> Moral Issues . Lawyer-agents may be cannily attempting to tout their talents without actually violating the rule against lawyers advertising their services . A more difficult question is whether a lawyer 's stake in such contracts affects his conduct of the defense . Consider the case of James Earl Ray , who now claims that he was denied effective counsel because of his lawyers ' interests in a book about him . His first lawyer , Arthur Hanes , made a deal with Ray and Author William Bradford Huie that provided for articles and a book about Ray by Huie . To cover mounting legal bills , Ray later turned his share over to Hanes . The lawyer thus earned at least $25,000 from Huie 's magazine articles before Ray fired him . Hanes then assigned his rights in the contract to Ray 's second lawyer , Percy Foreman , who anticipated that they would eventually be worth $400,000 .
