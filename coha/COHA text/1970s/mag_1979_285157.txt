RICHARD III by William Shakespeare <P> A I Pacino ought to have sprouted a long , pointy mustache for his Richard III so he could twirl it . Returning to the stage for this limited engagement ( through July 15 ) at Broadway 's Cort Theater , the man who mumbled so effectively through two Godfathers on-screen turns Shakespeare 's " bunch-back 'd toad " into a smarmy caricature villain out of silent movies and old comic strips ; he personifies the sort of dastard who forecloses the mortgage on the family farm and threatens the virtue of fair young damsels . <P> In Shakespearean terms , this interpretation is an unconscionable outrage , yet it leaves a vivid comic impression . What makes Pacino dreadfully wrong for the role enhances what is prickingly funny about the way he plays it . In social mobility , this young ( 39 ) actor has come a long way upward from The Bronx , but no one has been able to mouthwash The Bronx from his speech patterns . From moment to moment , his urban streetside inflection breaks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry a Shakespearean line , so he spits out the poetry and mars the imagery . He strikes just two vocal chords : one , the brawling ranter , the other the insinuative little-boy whiner . Furthermore , he tends to lisp . Toward the end of the play , when Richard 's fortunes are abysmally low , he asks one of his few loyal allies : " Will our friends pwoove all twoo ? " <P> Pacino commits the cardinal sin of the actor by playing directly and shamelessly to the audience , even to the point of facial telegraphy with broad smirks , grins and grimaces . It is an attention-getting device for securing the playgoers ' sympathy . As a result , the corrupt ambition and awful malignity of Richard are whittled away , and he appears as no more than a roguish prankster . <P> The whole enterprise has been directed like a five-alarm fire by David Wheeler , so that the dynamics of action and the definition of character are lost . One exception is the scene in which Richard woos Lady Anne ( Penelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father-in-law , Henry VI , whom Richard has murdered , as he has her husband . Here Pacino slows the jigging pace and his own manic mockery to make effective use of his macho sex appeal . This is not to propose that he next put Romeo and Juliet on his hit list .
