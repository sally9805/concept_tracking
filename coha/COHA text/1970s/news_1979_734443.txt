txt The Chrysler Corporation expressed optimism today that it would be able to raise the money needed to match the $1.5 billion in loans that the Carter Administration said yesterday it would ask Congress to guarantee . It was clear , however , that a large portion of the rescue funds for the auto maker would have to come from sources other than borrowing , such as union and governmental grants . The governmental grants would be mainly from states where Chrysler has interests , and might also be from cities such as Detroit . Loan Costs Could Choke Company Many supporters of Chrysler who were questioned today ? including company , Federal and state officials , union leaders and car dealers ? said that , if the company wound up having to borrow $3 bil lion to finance its new-product and corporate rehabilitation programs , the cost of the loans could choke it . Under the Administration 's proposal , Congress would be asked to guarantee half of a total of $3 billion Tor the rescue package . To obtain these guarantees , Chrysler would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees . It would also have to get financial concessions from parties with a stake in the company 's survival and possibly sell some assets . " The chances of us raising the funds are good , " said Wendell W. Larsen , a Chrysler vice president who has been involved for more than a year in the company 's appeals to the Government for various types of assistance . " With the Administration 's support , a lot of people are going to be willing to line up who were hesitant to do so before . " Chrysler reported earlier this week that in the first nine months of this year it lost $743.3 million and that it expected to lose approximately $1 billion this year . Most of those questioned said they expected smaller amounts would be required and backed in Congress once the Administration 's proposals were considered by the lawmakers . In Washington , the Administration 's plan to help Chrysler appeared to face swift action in the House of Representatives but delays in the Senate . A spokesman for the House Banking Committee said its subcommittee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller shortly and to act on the proposal next week . In Washington , Senator William Proxmire , Democrat of Wisconsin , was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that the Senate Banking Committee , of which he is chairman , would begin hearings Nov. 19 and continue them " until the many issues involved " had been " thoroughly explored and discussed . " Mr. Proxmire , who has strongly opposed Government aid to Chrysler , added that he planned to see " that the terms of the legislation reported are as tough and protective of the public interest as possible . " " They should insure maximum security for the Federal guarantees and maximum participation by the other parties involved , " the Senator said . " I am deeply disappointed that the Administration bill does not provide more support for this position . " Mr. Proxmire was apparently displeased that the Administration proposal did not require that the loan guarantees be senior to all other credit extended to the company . The proposal , while stating that the loan guarantees must be " secured , " gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conclude a financing package . No Contribution Targets Set Also , while the plan stresses that all parties with a stake in Chrysler 's future must contribute to the rescue , no contribution targets were set for banks , states , cities , suppliers and other concerned parties . Senator Jake Garn of Utah , the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee , said that a " lot of questions must be answered before I could even consider committing public funds for loan guarantees . " As currently interpreted , the Administration plan would prohibit Chrysler from drawing upon any funds it may raise through the loan guarantee until it has in place commitments for a total of $1.5 billion . The optimism expressed by Chrysler 's Mr. Larsen was shared in varying degrees by others interviewed . " It can be done and we want to be a big part of it , " said George Weeks , executive secretary to Gov . William G. Milliken of Michigan , the moderate Republican who several months ago initiated a bipartisan appeal by a group of governors to President Carter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan , where Chrysler has its headquarters , would provide the company with up to $185 million in loans , purchase Chrysler land and offer Chrysler autos as prizes in the state 's lotteries . Douglas A. Fraser , president of the United Automobile Workers union , said in an interview yesterday that the union was willing to consider providing additional aid to the company if required to do so but that no further concessions would be made to the company with respect to its tentative contract agreement recently reached with the union covering some 123,000 Chrysler hourly and salaried employees . Although a substantial amount of Chrysler 's fund-raising effort is based on obtaining loans , much of it is not . Furthermore , it could not be determined what funds raised by the company independent of loan guarantees could be counted as part of its matching funds effort . Chrysler analysts said that they assumed the $203 million in contract concessions from the United Automobile Workers could be counted as well as the union 's decision to allow the company a year 's deferral in the payment of V00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They also said they believed the Government would accept the expected savings of $150 million in expenses when suppliers agreed to a freeze on prices until the end of this year . In the long haul however , the analysts add , Chrysler 's strategy for raising its matching money is based on a variety of other factors , only a few of which have began to materialize . Governor Milliken said in an interview last month that , once the Administration set forth its position , he would ask other states in which Chrysler has substantial interests to give the company special consideration . These states include New York , Delaware , Ohio , Illinois , Missouri and Indiana . Chrysler has said that it hopes that aid from these states and Michigan would amount to about $300 million . Aid from cities such as Detroit is also expected .
