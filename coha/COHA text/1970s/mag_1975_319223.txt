EVELYN WAUGH , A BIOGRAPHY <P> by CHRISTOPHER SYKES 462 pages . Little , Brown . $12.50 . <P> One of this century 's funniest writers , Evelyn Waugh was also one of its most melancholy , a man submerged in private rancor . " You have no idea how much nastier I would be if I was not a Catholic , " he informed a friend . " Without supernatural aid I would hardly be a human being . " <P> Waugh 's youth was by no means blighted . His family was congenial-his father Arthur ran a small but prestigious publishing house-and lived comfortably in a London suburb , amid books and talk of books . The adolescent Evelyn saw Oxford as a kind of enchanted kingdom . For a time he became one of its leading fauns , an aesthete shuttling between Hamletic conversation and Falstaffian drinking . After graduation , Waugh had a desultory try at being an artist . Failing at that , he became a teacher at third-rate boarding schools . He began a book , informing the curious that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , says Biographer Sykes , Evelyn also entered " an extreme homosexual phase which , for the short time it lasted , was unrestrained emotionally and physically . " After revealing this aspect of Waugh 's nature , Sykes abruptly drops it , announcing that " names and details need not and should not be given . " This bowdlerizing process takes place throughout Evelyn Waugh , giving the distinct impression of a book composed with scissors . <P> Adrenaline World . Sykes is almost as coy about Waugh 's " straight " life . Evelyn married early-only to have his wife run off with a friend . A few years later he married again , more happily , and eventually fathered three sons and three daughters . <P> The History of the Eskimos emerged from the printer as Decline and Fall in 1928 . Waugh , at 24 , had found his calling as a master of black comedy and satire . Other novels , among them Vile Bodies , A Handful of Dust and Black Mischief , followed regularly throughout the ' 30s , always in Waugh 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinated observer of the often comic clash between primitive and advanced cultures . From a newspaper assignment to cover the Italian invasion of Ethiopia , he got the material for Scoop , still a hilarious guide to the adrenaline world of journalism . Much of the novel 's lunatic telegraphese was pure reportage . After the invasion , for example , newspaper offices heard a rumor that the Italians had bombed a native hospital , killing a beautiful American nurse . Editors demanded the story of " nurse upblown . " After a vain search , Waugh cabled back : " Nurse unupblown . " <P> In World War II , Evelyn was something of a misfit . Despite an ample display of valor in the battle for Crete , the insubordinate officer was passed from general to general . In Yugoslavia , Evelyn amused himself by circulating a story that Tito was a lesbian in drag . The story caught up with the marshal . " Ask Captain Waugh , " he told the British commander , " why he thinks I am a woman . " For the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss for words .
