A REPORTER AT LARGE PROFESSOR CHARLES MOSKOS , JR. , who is chairman of the Department of Sociology at Northwestern University , has made the military enlisted man his specialty . When Moskos was in New York a while ago for a sociologists ' conference , I had a long talk with him as part of an investigation I was making into the condition of our armed forces in the wake of the Nixon Administration 's momentous policy decision , in the spring of 1973 , to dispense with conscription and rely entirely on volunteer manpower . Conversations I had previously had in the Pentagon and elsewhere had indicated that quantitatively the experiment was a success . Its qualitative and social aspects , I had learned in talking with various people  --  including Professor Morris Janowitz , of the University of Chicago , who is the author of " The Professional Soldier , " published in 1960 , and preeminent among sociologists of the military  --  were still being widely debated . Moskos ' best-known book , " The American Enlisted Man : The Rank and File in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Professional Soldier . " Janowitz was concerned primarily with the patterns of officers ' lives and careers ; Moskos concentrated on enlisted men and how they fared . I learned that Janowitz had encouraged Moskos in the project , and the two had become good friends . Moskos had done some research before he started work on his hook , having served as an enlisted man from 1956 to 1958 in an Army combat-engineers unit in Germany . He had then been fresh out of Princeton , where he had studied sociology , and he was happier in the Army than he had been at college . Moskos ' father was a shoe repairman in Chicago ; his parents were Greeks who had emigrated from northern Epirus in what today is Albania . Moskos , as he once expressed it , " had never felt comfortable with the snobbish side of Princeton . " He discovered that he could make friends in the engineers outfit with great ease , and he liked the friends he made , none of whom held his Princeton degree against him . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live , for a few days at a time , with units in many places , including the United States , Vietnam , the Dominican Republic , Germany , Korea , Japan , and Cyprus . In Cyprus , he has been studying the United Nations ALL  --  VOLUNTEEK-11 peacekeeping forces , on and off , since 1969 . ( His book about the U.N . troops , " Peace Soldiers , " will be published this year . ) Moskos has a talent for talking with enlisted men and finding out what is on their minds . He is a compact man of medium height , black-haired and vigorous , who speaks in an easy , casual manner , which surprised me slightly , because I had read a good deal of his work , and , like most sociology  --  at least when sociologists are addressing others of their kind -- -it seems formal and stiff . I knew that he had some doubts about the all-volunteer force , and I asked him what they were . " One of my big worries is the race thing , " Moskos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blacks within the context of the services ' formal racial integration . It 's bad . It predates the zero draft , so I am not saying that the all-volunteer system is the cause , but I am afraid it may make it worse . " He said that by the mid-nineteen-fifties , half a dozen years after President Truman issued a historic executive order abolishing segregation in the armed forces , integration was very nearly an accomplished fact and in that respect the military was far ahead of civilian society . Moskos felt that by the end of the nineteen-sixties an all too brief era of harmonious relations had ended , although integration , of course , remained the formal policy . " Some of the trouble has been well publicized , " he said . " The race riots aboard Navy ships , the fraggings ' in Vietnam , violence between black soldiers and the local people in Korea and West Germany . What may be more significant eventually , though it is not nearly so dramatic , is the sharp rise in race consciousness among the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  forms of greeting , like hand-slapping , and the popularity of slave bracelets , and the formation of ' brotherhood ' social clubs . Self-imposed , informal black segregation , especially during off-duty hours , is de rigueur as far as the low-ranking black enlisted men are concerned . This is in the context of no formal color barrier whatever within the military community  --  absolutely equal treatment , regardless of race , at swimming pools , barbershops , snack bars , even in housing for dependents off the post . During duty hours , whites and blacks , typically , are working together with little , if any , display of racial animosity . Many white soldiers are working under black superiois . Nevertheless , the off-duty separation is ominous . What haunts commanders is the possibility that black servicemen might feel they owe higher loyalty to each other than to the United States military . " In one way , Moskos said , he thought that the all-volunteer system might work for the better . " There may be less internal turbulence , because no one in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That should reduce tensions in general . " W hat worried him was the fact that there had been a steady increase in the proportion of blacks in the Army 's combat arms  --  the infantry , artillery , and armored units  --  especially in the infantry . " In an ironic sense , it is a step forward , " he said . " Within the military , combat personnel are still accorded higher prestige than non-combat soldiers  --  they are admired but not envied . " I-k was also concerned that , as a corollary to black overrepresentation in the combat units , blacks were underrepresented among technical specialists . Moskos said he thought that the race problem was 111 LICII worse in Europe than in the United States , and worst of all in Germany  --  among our 1900U NATO ground-force troops there . " I do n't want to pretend to know more than I know , or to belittle the hopes and plans of the Seventh Army , our main unit in Germany , to improve things , " he said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of the low-ranking enlisted men there , white and black , are sullen and disaffected from the military system . You know , the sharp cleavage these days is between the short-term , low-ranking enlisted men and the noncoms  --  especially the senior noncoms  --  who are making the Army a career . In the Second World War , the enlisted men resented officers That 's completely out of date . These days , the privates call the career noncoms ' lifers , ' and the ' lifers , ' especially staff sergeants and master sergeants , are their villains . There is a real generation gap , and it coincides largely with whether you drink alcohol or smoke marijuana  --  whether you are a ' juicer ' or a ' head . ' Two-thirds of the noncoms are juicers , I 'd estimate , and only a minuscule proportion of them also smoke marijuana . More than half , certainly , of the lower-ranking enlisted men use marijuana , and while a lot of them also drink there is considerable overlap  --  the individual soldier easily identifies himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one group or the other . lArell , the heads and the juicers are split . They feel altogether different about the propriety of using drugs . A good many noncoms are easing up about marijuana . They used to think any drug use was a moral outrage . Now some of diem see it merely as an efficiency problem . Both heads and juicers regard heroin use  --  there are very few heroin users  --  as deviant behavior . Even the few heroin users think so . I am not talking about drugs and alcohol during duty hours ; I am talking about what happens after retreat , when the job is done for the day , and the men get hack to their barracks . And that is a complicating factor in Europe ; the barracks have become of great concern , because the . troops do n't go out much . For whatever reason , our young soldiers seem to be petrified by foreign culture . They stay in their barracks , turn on their stereos and strobe lights , and smoke dope , in contrast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you smoke you do it off post . With so many men staying in their barracks voluntarily , you get a ' black ' barracks nr a ' white ' barracks , and any barracks can become a tough neighborhood , precisely the way any block in a community can become tough . You get race hooliganism fighting on the company street , thefts , muggings , all of it . That point has been reached in several instances . " Moskos spoke about the differences between the first-tcrmers who came into the Army while the draft was still in force and the new volunteers . " There is a difference in expectations . The earlier volunteer came in with a rather low-level commitment to the Army , and most of the draftees were not committed at all . They did not expect much and they did not get much , sn at least they were not disappointed . They were concerned with being given a clean discharge . Company punishment Article 15 punishment , which the captain can impose without a courtmartial  --  was a considerable deterrent against breaking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with quite a lot of petty harassment , telling themselves , ' I can get through this . ' The new men arc coming in with much higher expectations . That 's especially true of those who have messed up somehow  --  have dropped out of school , say . Things have gone wrong , and they see the Army as a second chance : I can get a high-school diploma . ' I can learn a trade . ' A good many of the white volunteers join for psychological reasons  --  looking for a place to gain maturity , or to get away from their mothers , or to travel . Blacks are less concerned about growing-up problems ; by eighteen a black has more or less resolved them on his block , if they are resolvable . So the black volunteers are more interested in the instrumental things  --  education , learning a skill . But in both cases expectations are high . And then if it turns out that all the Army really has for the volunteer is a job washing tanks , or winding reels of telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His morale sinks lower than the old draftee 's . The new volunteer also has a shorter fuse on his temper . He does not like to he barked at by the sergeant , and there arc still lots of harking sergeants . Article 1 5 punishment is not enough to deter him . He looks on it as a deal : I 'll go AWOL for five days , and they 'll restrict me to the company for a month . Fair enough . ' He is n't even greatly worried about getting a less than honorable discharge  --  he does n't think that that would he the end of the world . In fact , though , it is a terrible stigma on the outside  --  especially for a poor black . By the time he realizes that , it 's too late . " Faced with such changes , some of the senior career noncoms are completely-at a loss . They 're a conservative force -- they are the upholders of the traditional military ideals of soldierly honor and the whole military mystique . They fee that their own prestige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the Army 's innovations  --  civilians doing kitchen-police duty , for instance  --  are ruining the institution . Many of them no longer have a personal commitment to the military system ; they are simply counting the days to their retirement . If you ask them what the trouble is , they 'll answer with the Pentagonese word voLAR ' the volunteer Army . There are senior noncoms , and noncoms of all sorts , luckily , who do not fee that way at all -- the adapters , I call them . They are not satisfied with the way things are , by any means , but they regard the new men as a challenge , a potentially invigorating force . The adapters enjo ) their own military service and think they are getting a lot out of it . They are actively engaged in trying to make the volunteer system work . Well , the Army roust , of course , figure nut ways and means of moving the many noncoms with attitudes somewhere in the middle between the tra-ditionalists and the adapters  --  toward the adapters ' end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . I mat ' overemphasize the racial problem in the Army in Europe , because that is what I 've been studying at first hand . Germany is probably the extreme case , but off-duty separation is the pattern everywhere in Japan and Korea , al-though not quite as marked in those two places , and in the United States . I 'd say that racism the American dilemma  --  is the problem in all the services , wherever the troops are . " Moskos pointed out that the Pentagon is well aware of the problem , and is working hard to alleviate it . " I believe the military has gone further in attacking racism than any other institution in our society has , " he said . He added that he thought there was " institutional racism " of a kind that was well-nigh unprovable , in spite of the services ' formal policy of nondiscrimination . What he called the " danger areas " were promotions , assignments , and punishments . He said that he thought the services were monitoring themselves in an effort to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that a black soldier did not get ten days ' restriction for an offense that would have cost a white soldier only five  --  hut that it was certainly hard to eliminate . All the services , Moskos reminded me , are teaching race relations in a program that has been worked out by the Defense Race Relations Institute ( DR.R.I. ) , which was established in 1971 , by the Department of Defense , to develop course materials and train course instructors . Almost every member of the armed forces takes the course , which deals with the dynamics of prejudice , examines real incidents that have occurred , and presents some minority-group history not just black history but the story of Mexican-Americans , Puerto Ricans , American Indians , Asian-Americans , and the impoverished whites of Appalachia . " It 's a fantastic effort , " Moskos said . " No organization has ever tried to teach race relations on such a scale . A thousand instructors are trained each year , and they fan out to all the services . In addition to D.R.R.I. programs , nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals with race problems , among others . " Officers and a certain number of noncoms in supervisory jobs are now rated in their efficiency reports on how well they arc handling race relations within their units , " Moskos went on . " That 's in dead earnest . A man with a failing mark may not get promoted . He could even lose his command , I am completely in favor of it , and the guys who are into it arc tremendously dedicated . I almost hate to say it , but the basic premise  --  that we can change the racial attitudes of individuals through a teaching program  --  is not proved . It 's ton snort to measure results . I 've seen considerable opposition to the classes at the company level  --  real doubts about them , I mean . Company officers arc saying , ' If we bring all that up , are n't we just opening old wounds ? ' The focus on injustices that blacks have suffered in the past is strong , and some white enlisted men simply tune out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that a surprisingly high percentage of the race-relationsprogram instructors are black . " There is no reason they should n't be black , but that fact alone creates curious problems , " he said . " Some ? , 1 : the black soldiers have so little faith in the military system that they question the credibility of a black officer teaching the race-relations course . They think he has gone over to the other side . And then , only time will tellwhether a race-relations-program assignment is good or bad for an officer 's or a noncom 's career . It could go either way . That puzzle does nothing for the instructors ' sense of security ; they are just hoping they are not in a dead-end slot . I 'd like to sec some shift in content away from the course 's emphasis : away from injustices suffered by blacks and toward positive reasons that military service is good for the black community  --  good for black health levels , good for black economic opportunity . A central role in the military is , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nightmares of some black intellectuals about territorial segregation or genocide . As long as the black serviceman is an integral part of the military establishment , those horrors are not going to happen . The most impressive part of D.R.R.I. so far is the sense of purpose of many people who are working on it . Truly amazing . You see that they believe the military is one institution  --  one of the few  --  that can improve black opportunity in a significant way . They may be right . When the seventies arc done , perhaps we 'll all sec , to the surprise of some , that the armed forces set the pace . " When Moskos spoke about his hopes for the D.R.R.I. program and for the general success of the all-volunteer forces , he sounded almost , if not quite , as devoted to the **25;5074;TOOLONG concept as Stephen Herhits , a Pentagon manpower expert I had talked to earlier . Yet I remembered , from having read Moskos ' writings on the subject , that as recently as two years earlier he had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might , as a practical matter , translate into service for perhaps sixty per cent of the young men and women in a given age group  --  say , from eighteen to twenty-two . Moskos had taken part in a small conference in New York City in the spring of 1971 which he and Janowitz , and the Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society  --  a group founded ten years earlier by Janowitzhad organized , and the Russell Sage Foundation had sponsored . Its subject was " Youth and National Service . " About twenty-five educators , social scientists , public officials , and executives of some of the voluntary associations  --  the National Center for Voluntary Action , the Peace Corps , the Office of Economic Opportunity  --  met and compared notes on opportunities and possibilities for national and community service of various kinds . Janowitz was the chairman of the meeting . Moskos ' paper , entitled " The Social Equivalent of Military Service , " argued that if a civilian alternative to military service was to be truly equivalent upper-middle-class young men and women should he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of service . The conferees were well aware , as they met , that the country was moving toward an all-volunteer military , yet some of them hoped that , even so , a parallel system of civilian service might be developed . They agreed that it would cost a lot of money . Most of them also agreed , however , that the word " volunteer " means more than a trade for money or immediate self-betterment  --  that there were a lot of young men and women motivated by , as Janowitz summed it up , " altruistic impulses , common identification , a search for a break in educational routines , personal attachment to a youth movement , or the aspiration to deal with community and national problems . " The question was what could he done for them if a term in the armed forces was not what they wanted . During my talk with Moskos , I reminded him of the conference and asked him what had become of his enthusiasm for the broader national-service idea . Moskos replied that he really had n't changed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , because politically it appeared to he a lost cause . " Since I can not have my preference , I try to think of ways to make the all-volunteer force work as well as possible , " he said . " Morris Janowitz feels much the same way . It is dangerous to generalize about the members of the LU.S. , but I 'd guess that more than half of them wish a national-service system of some kind were possible . But they know that almost no one in Congress would vote for it . Consequently , most of them are thinking about ways of improving the all-volunteer forces . That puts us at odds with countless academics  --  all those who think that anything that makes the military better is a betrayal of higher values . M ) personal objection to the all-volunteer system is the injustice of it . An all-volunteer force is a form of class privilege . Upper-middle-class kids wo n't serve in it . What kind of society excuses its most privileged members from defending it I 've managed to compartmentalize that objection in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " SOfar ' the recruiters ' greatest suc- cess , judging by the rising chart-lines for the numbers of volunteers , has been with women . %Vhcn a commission headed 111 former Secretor ) of Defense Thomas S. Gates was conducting the studies that led to the present all-volunteer system , the possibility that women might make up a substantial proportion of the uniformed forces received little attention  --  although adding the number of qualified and available young women to the number of qualified and available young men would have more than doubled the total of potential volunteers . Since the Second World War the percentage of women in the armed forces had dropped well below its wartime high of more than two per cent . In 1971 , it was only 1.6 percent . By the time the all-volunteer experiment began , however , the Department of Defense was contemplating using more women , and using them in a much wider variety of jobs . The objective was to recruit approximately 14,600 during fiscal 1974 ? in round figures , 6,700 for the Army , 4,000 for the Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marines . That would have raised the total number of women on active duty from 45,900 at the end of fiscal 1973 to 60,500 twelve months later , which would have amounted to almost three per cent of the armed forces . The goal of finding 1,200 women volunteers a month , or forty of the total of 1,000 volunteers a day which the all-volunteer system now requires , seemed optimistic , but it was soon evident , from the number of female applicants who appeared , that each service could easily meet its quota , even though the qualifying standards for women were ( and still are ) much higher than for men . All the services require women volunteers to be high-school graduates or to pass an equivalency exam . They must also score above the median grade in the obligatory aptitude exam , known as the Armed Forces Qualification Test . In next to no time , the Department of Defense , delighted to find that at least one aspect of recruiting was easier than it had expected , raised its sights and planned to increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal 1976 . Despite difficulties -- shortages of barracks space , training facilities , and uniforms  --  by the end of fiscal 1975 the recruiters were more than a year ahead of the revised plan . There were 97,000 women on active duty , with a further increase to 109,200 planned for the end of fiscal 1976 . Mrs. Nancy Goldman , a research associate in the Center for Social Organization Studies at the University of Chicago , is the ranking academic authority on the role of women in the military . She is a fellow of the LU.S. ; one of the editors of its journal , Armed Forces and Society ; and she has contributed articles on the subject to the American Journal of Sociology and The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science . Mrs. Goldman was graduated from Smith College in 1956 and then studied sociology at the University of Chicago from 1957 to 1959 , but she did not get her master 's degree until 1971 . In the interim , she got married and had two children , and she decided that motherhood took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldman 's interests are not confined to women in the military ; she is concerned about the sociology of occupations and professions in general , and in the sociology of sex roles . It is not hard to guess that she has lived some of her research . I called on Mrs. Goldman at her apartment in Chicago , and we talked in her sunlit living room , filled with paintings and art objects . Mrs. Goldman has a pretty , friendly face and light-brown hair . Her voice is small and her speech precise . She gave Janowitz the credit for having steered her into military sociology . " I wanted a part-time research job in 1971 , " she said . " Not full-time , because I have a family , and I did not want to get too involved . So I took my thesis to show Morris  --  my subject was the organizahighest possible level , it could be very high . " Mrs. Goldman pointed nut to me that eight out of ten military job specialties are open to women ; the reasons that twenty per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be assigned to the Navy 's combataircraft or combat ships , and that as a matter of policy the Army and the Air Force exclude women from combat-oriented specialties . " A specialty may be listed as open , but the chances that a woman will actually get such a job assignment are very low , " she explained . " But that does n't much matter . Seventy-five per cent of the actual jobs in the defense establishment are non-combat jobs , and all of them are really ' open . ' ' That 's why 100,000 or so out of more than 2,000,0 ( 10 does n't overwhelm me . I do n't think that mans young women want women 's jobs . I think they want the broadest possible range of assignments . The choices actually narrowed after the Second World War . Thai women were mostly in nursing or in administrative and clerical assignments , but at least there were some in naval intelligence and in communications . Then there was a time after Korea when it looked as if there might not be any place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more than a vestigial role . That did not quite happen , but as recently as 1971 ninety per cent of all the enlisted women on duty were either medical and dental specialists or administrative and clerical specialists . Things are much better than that now . Wcmen are repairing airplanes , operating radios , teaching in the military schools . They are serving as doctors . The Navy is allowing women to fly some types of planes  --  helicopters , transports , and weather aircraft . Not jets , because they say the physical stamina required is too great . " It 's unreasonable , I 'd say , to expect the military to pioneer in changing the role of women , " Mrs. Goldman continued . " But in some ways it is ahead of many civilian employers . There is a strong emphasis on equal opportunities for men and women , and equal pay for equal work . There is better job security than in civilian employment . The services will need more women officers , and the Army , Navy , lnd Air Force Reserve Officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of women . Having gone to an all-women 's lege , and assuming that things have n't changed completely , I- ca n't help thinking that a military career ought to sound good to anyone whose mind is n't already entirely closed to the idea of such a career . Officers ' salaries now start at eight thousand dollars a year , and there is a very long list of additional benefits , plus long paid vacations . I think almost any college girl would be surprised by the options open to her . There are problems to be solved . The question of marriage and children is a big one  --  there is a staff meeting on that at the Pentagon every five minutes . It is up to the military to figure out how to make a place for the career servicewoman who wants to get married and have children . The best they 've done so far is to rule that women who have children are allowed to remain in the service as long as arrangements are made for the children 's care . Unwanted pregnancies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of birth-control information in the military is much better than in comparable civilian groups . The new generation is prepared for coeducational existence in almost every phase of life . It has been their experience . Except for a few highly specialized units , perhaps , I doubt if the military will he able to differentiate itself sharply from civilian society in this respect  --  at least , not in the long run . The short run is another question , because many of the high-ranking officers , with complete sincerity , do not want to change their image of the military  --  heroic and masculine , if not all-masculine . If manpower problems became serious , it would be easier for them to substitute civilians for military personnel  --  they might be women civilians , but they would n't be women in uniform . " Mrs. Goldman looked discouraged by that thought . " But of course , " she added with a smile , " all the service academies are going to admit women . They have had contingency plans looking to that day for a long time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " N a meeting of the Inter-University Seminar in October , 1973 , the two hundred men and women who came to the gathering , in Chicago , were not only from all over the United States but from all over the world  --  Argentina , Brazil , Canada , England , France , Indonesia , Ireland , Israel , Italy , Km-ea , Lebanon , the Netherlands , Scotland , and West Germany . More than forty of a total of a hundred and eighty Americans present were military men or government officials , including General Calvert Benedict , deputy commandant of the Army War College ; General J. H. Cushman , commandant of the Command and General Staff College ( who brought several members of his faculty ) ; and representatives of all the service academies ( including the Coast Guard Academy ) , the National Security Council , and the Office of the Seerev-try of Defense . The military men looked just like American college professors , for the most part , because , with one or two exceptions , they were all dressed in civilian clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Moskos , Mrs. Goldman , and Dr. Albert Biderman , another social scientist specializing in military matters , who works at the Bureau of Social Science Research , in Washington . I also recognized Major General Robert G. Gard , Jr. , who had just assumed command of Fort 01-d , California , and whom I had met earlier at an American Sociological Association meeting . Gard is a member of the I. US. , and he attends academic discussions of military matters as often as he can , which has meant two or three times a year in recent years . He is an Army brat , who was horn at West Point , in 1928 , and was graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1950 . After he had served as an artillery battery commander in Korea , the Army sent him to Harvard to study social sciences . For three years , he taught at West Point , and after getting his Ph.D . at Harvard and attending various Army schools he went to the Pentagon as one of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served with the 9th Infantry Division in Vietnam , first as division artillery commander and then as the division 's chief of staff . By 1971 , when he was promoted to brigadier general , he had been awarded twenty-five medals and was one of the most decorated Ph.D.s in the United States Army , but his new assignment  --  director of Discipline and Drug Policies in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel of the Army , at the Pentagon  --  sounded like a career breaker . Old soldiers say that officers who are intellectuals can rise so high and no higher , and Gard had already broken through the traditional ceiling , which is full colonel . His combat record was impeccable , and he had been to all the right Army schools , but he was undeniably an intellectual  --  perhaps the Army 's prize specimen . Drug abuse was , And remains , an unmanageable problem to the Army ; it was a chance for Gard to fail as he had never faded before . Two years later , in 1973 , lie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-five , one of the Army 's youngest two-star officers ; he had not solved the drug problem , or the discipline problem , by any means , but he had helped greatly to effect a number of reforms in the way officers and noncoms handle men who constantly break the rules . Gard obtained approval to change the name of his own job to Director of Human Resources Development , and his new title summed up the direction in which he hoped the Army would move . He was much pleased by the Fort Ord command a troop command , not a staff assignment . Fort Ord is a huge complex , with a total population of nearly 70,000 , including about 8,000 new volunteers . One of Gard 's special interests was " advanced individual training " ? the period , after the first seven weeks of basic training , during which a new man begins to learn a specific military skill . Between seminar sessions  --  which dealt , among other things , with civilian-military relations and the functions of armed forces in general  --  I had lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've lost ten pounds in the last two months , " he told me , slapping his trim waistline . " I had to . I did n't dare face the troops otherwise . " The General 's manner is amiable and calm ; he is slightly taller than average ; he has sandy hair , cut short ; his expression is open , smiling , and cheerful . He has heard a lot of criticism of the military from civilians in recent years , and he is well aware that most critics thinking about the sins of the Army brass have a mental image of a major general that is quite different from the way Gard looks and acts . He does not mind surprising the i4I ; rn just beginning to find my way around Fort Ord , " Gard said . " I probably should n't be here at all . I 'm playing hooky . It is fascinating to work with the new volunteers . I suppose I 'm on the spot . That is , I 've talked an awful lot , and written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain its traditional values  --  to my mind , its essential values and , at the same time , adapt to modern demands . And suddenly I have 8,000 volunteers on my hands , and I 'm supposed to do it ! " Gard said that he had found Fort Ord 's atmosphere a little bit " tight " when he arrived , and that he was doing his best to encourage his men  --  especially the career noncoms who do much of the teaching  --  to relax a little " The volunteers , to he sure , are volunteers , but they are also members of their own generation , " lie said . " Like everybody  --  well , nearly everybody  --  in his late teens or early twenties , they are hostile to large bureaucracies . They hate insensitive administrators . They loathe encumbering procedures . When they encounter an out-of-date policy , they assume  --  and they 're usuallt right  --  that apathy and inertia on the part of the people in charge are to blame . They are suspicious of the military . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation , perhaps , but still a wholesome one . A lot of young people , including some volunteers , now almost take it for granted that the military is wasteful , reactionary , oppressive  --  you name it . Going beyond that , they question the effectiveness of using force as a means of achieving political objectives . That 's fine . The problem is that in the absence of a consensus among nations on how to achieve peaceful change it seems inevitable that the United States  --  all the modern Western societies  --  will be required to maintain substantial active military forces for quite some time . However , our military establishment has become the largest bureaucracy in the United States ; it is prone to bureaucratic ills , no matte , how hard it tries to avoid them . To make matters worse , the military must hold to a set of values that are contrary to the values of liberal , civilian society , because part of the military has to he ready to engage in combat . That is its purpose . So the military organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group , not the individual . It stresses discipline and obedience , not freedom of expression . It demands confidence and trust . It requires immediate decision and prompt action , not thorough analysis and extensive debate . It relies on training , simplification , and predictable behavior , not education , sophistication , and empiricism . It offers austerity , not material comforts . There is the difficulty . Those concepts are not universally admired , yet every combat soldier and every serviceman who may be required to support combat closely must be imbued with them . At the same time , the thick crust of senseless custom must be cracked wherever that 's appropriate . " Gard said he believed that the Army had tended to overemphasize institutional objectives , even unimportant ones , as long as the draft was in effect , and that not enough attention was paid to the impact of that policy on the soldiers . He thought that this was changing . " The organization 's effectiveness , as always , has the top priority , " he said . " But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as personally rewardMg  --  a continuation , not an interruption , of their personal development . Those two things are completely compatible . I 'm fond of the idea that there is a contract , an unwritten contract , between the soldier and the military . The armed services are entitled to expect job proficiency and disciplined behavior ; the soldier , in return , is owed respect as a person , satisfying work to do , and the opportunity for individual development . I think it is a reasonable bargain . My rough guess is that at least two-thirds of the new men at Ord arc after remedial education or a skill that they can transfer , at some later date , to a civilian occupation . The idea that they arc looking for ' permissiveness ' by that I mean toleration of their failures to meet established military standards  --  is completely wrong . It is the other way around . They want a vigorous , challenging program . The worst thing we could do is fail to give it to them . " THE I.U.S. meeting lasted several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down to talk in the living room of his house . I complimented him on the success of the conference , which seemed to me self-evident . Janowitz , who seldom yields to undue enthusiasm , admitted , after some coaxing , that it had gone well . In the next breath , he warned me against thinking that the military establishment listens carefully to academic students of the military . " I get a lot of invitations to speak  --  at the Air Force Academy , for instance  --  and so do some of the others . I do a lot of lecturing . That 's what I am  --  I 'm a teacher . But sometimes , when I hear myself making the same points , over and over , that I was making ten years ago ... " Janowitz laughed . " I had a new idea not long ago , " he said . " My first in months . I wrote an article and some staff officer forwarded it to the general who was then chief of staff . I understand he read it carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " A moment later , Janowitz 's voice did betray enthusiasm . " We are getting somewhere , " he said . " The I.U.S. is growing steadily . I can imagine meetings like this one held frequently , scattered throughout the country . Scholars in any field have to know what other scholars are doing and thinking , and we are helping them keep in touch with one another . Young people studying the military who are not getting support from their own universities can come to us . We can pat them on the hack and say , ' It 's legitimate . ' The scholarly journals still tend to reject articles on the military , no matter how good they are , but it 's nothing like twenty years ago . There has been a very noticeable change in the atmosphere just in the past two years . Suddenly the study of military institutions is relevant . Books are coming in by the dozen from all over tht. world . ' The Professional Soldier ' is selling as well as it did during its early years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the real problems be posed consistently . The point is not to predict but to clarify , so the society can come to terms with the issues . " One clarifying concept in " The Professional Soldier " was Janowitz 's idea of " constabulary forces " as a way for our military to regard itself in years to come : The use of force in international relations has been so altered that it seems appropriate to speak of constabulary forces , rather than of military forces . The constabulary-concept provides a continuity with past military experiences and traditions , but it also offers a basis for the radical adaptation of-the profession . The military establishment becomes a constabulary force when it is continuously prepared to act , committed to the minimum use of force , and seeks viable international relations , rather than victory , because it has incorporated a protective military posture . janowitz enlarged on the constabulary concept in considerable detail in his hook , and he has referred to the idea in many of the papers he has written since . He saw the military establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic leaders  --  warrior types who embodied traditionalism , glory , the martial spirit , and personal valor and military man-agers , pragmatists concerned with the scientific and rational conduct of war , and having close links to civilian so-duty . He also noted a third kind of professional , the military tcchnoloo - ist " With the introduction of nucle- ar weapons and missiles , the military seems to have been almost converted into a giant engineering establishment , " he wrote . But technologists were not so likely to hold crucial leadership roles , he felt  --  or , at least , not unless they developed other skills and changed their outlook . The military managers , Janowitz argued , were becoming more important , although the military actually required a balance among the three types . The model military manager would not displace the heroic leader , but he would " undermine the long-standing traditionalism of the military establishment " and he would " weaken its opposition to technological innovation . " Janowitz was urging a rethinking of the entire meaning of the military profession . He still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force  --  a self-contained , technically trained force-in-being , " Janowitz told me . " We have never had one before . The United States has to confront this issue for the first time in our history : How does a full-time professional military fit into the larger framework of a democratic society ? How do these professionals  --  officers and enlisted men  --  mesh with civilian life ? We are no longer talking about a distinctive , isolated , ' heroic ' calling ; this is a profession and an occupation , subject to all the vicissitudes of life in any bureaucratic setting . Major reorganizations will have to be made  --  in unitary education , in the career systems , in the way personnel are assigned . The profession needs complete redefinition . Otherwise , for the long run the military profession will not attract men and women of the necessary quality . For example , a serious problem that has been given little thought is how to link a military career , seldom longer than twenty years , to a second , civilian career . A considerable number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for six years or less  --  as many as do now . Their service , essentially , will be an interlude in their civilian life . But a great many will stay twenty years , in order to qualify for a pension . What then ? Well , one possibility I 'd favor is to redefine military service as the first stage of a two-stage career in public service , with a civil-service job as the second stage . Then an eighteenyear-old could plan his life in terms of a real career . After an enlisted man or woman had completed perhaps three periods of military service successfully , he or she would he qualified for a civil-service job and could transfer to it , with credits toward a pension to be paid on retirement from the second career  --  and , incidentally , that could be a way to a reform of the military pension system and its appalling costs . Another change that is badly needed is to cut down on the continuous reassignment of personnel from one station to another , which is dune to prevent stagnation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organization to accept constant change . It made some sense when we were training small , versatile cadres for expansion in case of war . Now the idea is outmoded . It 's expensive . It disrupts military effectiveness and solidarity . When service people complain about the military , this endless rotation is one of their major gripes . For the Army , I think we could adopt a modified version of the British regimental structure . That is , each officer and enlisted man would be attached to a basic unit , and he would rotate on assignments within that unit . If he left for staff duty or special schooling , he would be expected to return afterward to his own brigade . The brigade , not the man , would he assigned to overseas duty . But the man would go with it A home-port concept for the Navy and a home base for the Air Force would be rough equivalents . " In the past , Janowitz went on , most officer recruits have entered military service not by attending one of the service academies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending Officer Candidate Schools after college . In 1970 , for instance , only two per cent of newly commissioned Army officers were graduates of West Point . Some planning estimates have proposed that , in the future , thirty or thirty-five per cent of our officers should start with academy training . Janowitz hopes nor . Since he hates the idea that the all-volunteer professional Army may develop into an isolated institution , erecting boundaries between itself and the civilian society , he is not happy about the increase in the size of the academies ; he wants the military to be integrated with the society , not separated from it . In the nineteen-sixties , a quarter of the entering cadets at West Point came from career military families ; they were the sons of men on active duty or of men who had completed twenty years of service . Many sons of noncommissioned officers were in the entering classes . If one counted cadets with uncles or cousins in the military , the percentage would have been much higher . About a quarter of the students in first-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Janowitz says , but the social isolation of the medical profession does n't call for quite the same concern . He thinks that father-son succession is probably essential to both the military and the medical professions , but he would nevertheless like to see the Officer Candidate School program , which has dwindled to almost nothing , revived . He would open it to students who had successfully completed their first two college years , and use to advantage the popular impulse to take a break somewhere in the college curriculum . " I 'd expect some to go back to college and civilian life after a short-term tour of duty as junior officers , " he said . " Others would decide on a military career , and they would be expected to complete work for their col- leLgtey. ? degrees while they were on active d In addition , Janowitz thinks , every college student in the United States should have access to a college R.O.T.C. program , although not necessarily on his or her own campus . He thinks there should he a composite training course in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accredited colleges in the vicinity . In a good many cities , he said , that arrangement has already been made informally ; he would like to see it formalized , publicized , and extended . Fourteen colleges removed themselves from the R.O.T.C. program during the days of anti-Vietnam agitation , and these included liberal-arts schools in the Northeast like Harvard , Dartmouth , Boston University , Yale , Columbia , and Brown . Those units were replaced by new ones , many of them in the South and Southwest , where the military 's social basis was still strong , and where military installations arc heavily concentrated . Young officers , no matter where they came from originally , seem to make the most social contacts in the South and Southwest , janowitz said , and marry more Southern and Southwestern girls ; when they retire , it is mostly to the South and South west . " There 's a limit to what we call representation ' ? the idea that the military must be a cross-section of the society , " janowitz said . " The armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goal is to keep the officer corps from becoming highly unrepresentative . ' We want officers with strong loyalties to democratic institutions , who are devoted to civilian control of the military , and who are thoroughly professional in their commitments . One assumes that recruitment on a broader democratic base is a way of finding them , but there is no way of proving this . There should be more alternatives to academy attendance  --  other channels . In two or three years , officer recruitment will be a problem in terms of quality and special skills . The services , especially the Navy , are already short of black officers . Some R.O.T.C. units are primarily black ; whether they will produce officers who will stay beyond their obligatory tours of duty remains to be seen . Still , we are getting a stream of officer recruits from urban , daytime universities , many of them in the North ; a good many of them arc Catholic , and they reach into the lower-middle-class and working-class populations . The academic quality of R.O.T.C. courses has gone up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corps . I 'd like to be sure that there will be enough . " Boston University , he added , has asked to have R.O.T.C. back . I asked Janowitz whether the idea of voluntary national service still interested him . He looked angry- " Of course " he said . " But it is dead . No one mentions it anymore . " Then he corrected himself . " That is n't quite right . The idea will be revived , hilt it will come in through the back door . We are not going to have a national-service youth agency  --  no one in Washington is interested in that at all , except a couple of diehards . But the idea of voluntary service is kept alive , in a diffuse way , through a great many organizations , essentially at the state and local levels . Religious groups run local programs , and so do a few municipalities . At the national level , there 's ACTION , a federal agency that is a merger of what remains of the Peace Corps and its domestic counterpart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several other national volunteer programs . Eventually , piecemeal , we shall get some of what I have advocated . I 'm convinced that if voluntary national service had been adopted , the majority of those eligible would have participated , either in military service or parallel civilian service  --  and the country would have been better served . Right now , it is important that the civilian society should direct the military in redefining its professional oudook , We moved into the all-volunteer force with virtually no national debate ; I frequently meet people who still do n't realize that we have it . The Congress , the Armed Services Committee , the Gates Commission  --  everybody dealt with a great transition almost exclusively in terms of monetary , economic incentives . That was the mold , and hardly anyone has broken out of it . But the vitality of the military profession depends on a delicate balance between a special sense of inner-group loyalty and participation in the larger society . This balance is everything . That 's one of the reasons that the ideas proposed by Al Biderman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of national emergencies are so , good . He has not suggested a diversion , as some traditionalists argue , from the military 's fundamental mission . Handling emergencies is our military tradition , but now the emergencies have changed to oil spills , pollution , environmental control , and waste of natural resources . " Finally , it is enormously important that military personnel take part in civic affairs and public affairs assum-ing that their physical rotation is slowed down enough for them to do so . We probably have to continue to keep the military out of partisan politics . In the Nest German military forces , you know , the idea that an Army man is a civilian in uniform has been pushed so far that active-duty officers and enlisted men are allowed to run for political office , although if they win they must take a leave of absence . We do n't want to go that far . But military personnel should certainly serve on local school hoards , on public panels , and on advisory committees . They should be in contact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as an antidote to social isolation That 's one of the ways our professional military will understand that deterrence  --  peacekeeping through a military presence  --  constitutes the modern definition of the heroic role .
