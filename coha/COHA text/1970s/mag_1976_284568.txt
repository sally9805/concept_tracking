Cain has just committed mankind 's first murder , and the Lord asks him what happened to Abel . " Am I my brother 's keeper ? " Cain replies , or so say most Bibles . Now , that is all changed . Says Cain : " Am I supposed to take care of my brother ? " As for his parents , there are no longer any euphemisms about Adam " knowing " Eve . The new version says straightforwardly that Adam and Eve " had intercourse . " <P> With these and similar wordings ( see box ) , the Good News Bible , published this week by the American Bible Society , turns Holy Writ into modern , everyday English . In doing so , the new translation continues one of the great success stories in publishing history . Until the late 1950s , the Bible Society limited itself to distributing low-cost editions of traditional translations . Then it decided to prepare its own Bible , beginning with a New Testament , aimed at roughly a high school reading level . <P> The strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1966 as Good News for Modern Man ( also called Today 's English Version ) , it has become the alltime paperback bestseller ( 52.5 million copies ) . In 1967 eight translators began the Old Testament , a far more difficult task . <P> High Style . Of the four major translations in recent years , the two British projects , the Jerusalem and the New English Bibles , emphasize high literary style . The New American Bible attempted some simplification but the Good News Bible goes much farther . It shuns what one of its translators , the Rev. Heber Peacock , brands " churchy gobbledygook , " as well as wording that might be confusing . In the 23rd Psalm , for example , " I shall not want " becomes " I have everything I need . " Traditionalists may find that in the process some of the poetry of the standard versions has been clarified out of existence . Often the results are blunt indeed : " Gossip is so tasty ! How we love to swallow it ! " ( Proverbs 26 : 22 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel 20:30 ) . <P> Good News is so conversational that readers may wonder guiltily if it is a " real " Bible at all . At first look it resembles Kenneth Taylor 's folksy The Living Bible , a paraphrase rather than a translation , which has sold nearly 20 million copies since 1971 . But Good News is a true translation , insists the Bible Society 's Eugene A. Nida . The Living Bible is " interested in what the author intended . We are interested in what he said . " This does not mean word-for-word translation . Says one project expert , " There is no way to translate the Hebrew poetic form into decent English . " The modernizers did , however , preserve the meaning of every sentence . Besides its readable style , the Good News Bible helps readers along with explanatory notes , and it is graced with 500 stylized line drawings by Swiss Artist Annie Vallotton . <P> With such a comprehensible , attractive Bible available at $2.50 in hardcover , $1.90 paperback , a clergyman phoned Translator Peacock the other day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , is now " so clear that I do n't have to interpret it .
