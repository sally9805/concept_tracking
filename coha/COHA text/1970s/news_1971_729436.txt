txt No fault auto insurance is working fine in Puerto Rico . After nearly 17 months of experience , this crowded island finds the controversial coverage really does deliver as promised : better value for the insurance dollar , better care for accident victims , faster payments of claims and sharply reduced legal and administrative costs . But lawyers are grumbling about lost business , and some insurance men are fearing for their jobs . The experience in this U.S. commonwealth shows what may well lie ahead for millions of stateside drivers . Bills to start no-fault programs have been introduced in 28 states , and Congress last month began committee hearings on a bill to establish a federal plan . Puerto Rico is the only place flying the U.S. flag where no-fault insurance has been in effect long enough to show its faults and advantages . ( Massachusetts has a very limited no-fault plan , but it is less than a half-year old . ) Basically , no-fault auto insurance aids accident victims without going through the lengthy and costly procedure of determining who is liable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , theft , property damage or liability for such damage ; if insurance against these is desired , it must be purchased separately as before . But no-fault pays medical costs , compensates for income lost because of the accident and pays death benefits . Wasted Premiums ? The object is to avoid the waste , delay and injustice that critics see in standard insurance plans . Under such plans , administrative and legal expenses devour 55 cents of every premium dollar , studies by the Department of Transportation show . In recent years , the premiums themselves have soared . Moreover , auto accident cases take 17% of the time of U.S. judges and contribute mightily to courtroom backlogs , studies show . But under Puerto Rico 's compulsory , noncancelable plan , 90 cents of every premium dollar is available for benefits . The owner of each car pays a Puerto Rican government agency $35 a year for the coverage . Without it , he ca n't get a license plate . The plan pays all of an auto accident victim 's medical and hospital expenses . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of limbs or sight and up to $15,000 in survivor 's benefits . The plan also pays 50% of lost income , though only up to a benefit of $50 a week the first year and $25 the second year . ( As per capita income here is only $1,426 a year , or less than half the U.S. mainland level , this compensation means more here than it would in the 50 states , of course . ) Boosting Benefits The plan has proven so successful that the government agency that runs it , the Administracion de Compensaciones por Accidentes de Automoviles , is seeking to boost loss-of-income compensation to 75% of regular pay up to a maximum benefit of $100 a week . " Actuarial reports show we can also increase death benefits to $25,000 " without raising rates , says Frank W. Fournier , executive director of the agency . The legislature will be asked to approve the increase , he says . The financial results do suggest leeway for added benefits . In its first year , no-fault administrators collected $17.5 million in premiums . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 28,000 accident victims and survivors . Before no-fault coverage , " nine out of 10 accident victims in Puerto Rico received no benefits of any kind , " says Mr. Fournier . This is because most motor vehicles on the island were n't covered by any insurance . Even stateside , two in 10 cars are n't covered . Thus the most dramatic impact of no-fault insurance has been on accident victims who might not be alive without the coverage . Take the poverty-stricken six-year-old lad who darted into the side of a truck just four days after nofault coverage went into effect . With brain tissue protruding through a gaping skull wound , he was rushed to the nearest hospital , a private institution a block away , for emergency surgery . Seven weeks in the hospital , usually with a private nurse by his side 24 hours a day , cost $2,300 . No-fault paid it all . Even if the boy had lived through a 45-minute ride to a public hospital , he never would have survived without the private nurse , his doctor says . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't materialized . Since accident benefits are n't related to liability , critics thought drivers would get careless and push the accident rate sharply upward . Last year the rate did go up 5%  --  but this was only half the 10% rise of the year before . And traffic deaths declined to 451 from 541 the previous year . Critics also predicted a huge rise in " pain and suffering " claims from accident victims demanding more - than the medical and economic loss benefit that no-fault provides . But insurance men say no such rise materialized . A victim can still sue for astronomical damages . But on the ground that no-fault covers all but the most colossal costs and losses , a victim can obtain personal injury liability damages only if his pain and suffering exceeds $1,000 in value or if his other non-property damages exceed $2,000 . And either these amounts or the ( benefits paid by no-fault ( whichever was higher ) would be deducted from the liability payment . These restriCtions on liability are designed to keep small liability claims from clogging courts . No-fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooperativa de Seguros Multiples de Puerto Rico , says it has n't had to pay a single auto accident personal injury liability claim since no-fault started . Therefore the company says it will seek Puerto Rican government approval to cut its rate on a standard personal injury driver 's liability policy to $33 a year  --  a sharp cut from the present $50 and from $68 before no-fault began . Thus , for $88 a year ( $35 for no-fault and $33 for liability ) , a driver would receive the liability protection as before  --  plus the benefits on nofault for himaelf and his family . The standard liability benefits ( a maximum of $5,000 per injury and $10,000 per accident ) do n't apply to the policyholder or his family , of course . Phantom Benefits But not everybody here likes no-fault coverage . Harvey B. Nachman , a lawyer whom the Puerto Rican Bar Association has selected to analyze no-fault insurance , contends that benefits are more " phantom " than real . The maximum survivor benefit of $15,000 is only paid if the victim had a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also complain that the plan has almost eliminated payments here for " pain and suffering . " Claims for such damages , which are over and above medical costs and economic losses , form the basis of many auto accident lawsuits . A number of attorneys contend that by thus restricting a citizen 's freedom under negligence law to sue for reparation , no-fault deprives citizens of some of their historic due-process rights . Advocates of no-fault insurance concede this is true to some extent . But they say that the right to sue under the traditional system causes massive injustice . A Department of Transportation study showed that the average auto insurance recovery of totally disabled accident victims in the U.S. was only $12,500  --  or merely 16% of their actual $78,000 economic loss . Persons with economic losses of more than $10,000 were likely to recover less than half of those losses . But on the other hand , the study showed that those with minor injuries who claim less than $500 in economic loss often recover between two and four times their real damages . Insurance companies frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suffering " claims , the study added . The Government Findings The Department of Transportation study also showed : ? Of those seriously injured in auto accidents ( or survivors of those killed ) , only 45% receive benefits from the present liability insurance system . One out of 10 receives nothing from any form of reparation . ? Of the $5.1 billion in compensable economic losses ( medical costs , lost wages and the like ) resulting from deaths and serious injuries in 1967 auto accidents , auto insurance repaid less than $1.1 billion while compensation from all other forms of insurance totaled only $1.4 billion . ? In the 220,000 lawsuits arising from 1968 auto accidents , the victims collected a total net after legal fees and other expenses of $700 million while lawyers collected $600 million plus expenses . ? An estimated 8% to 10% of all drivers fit into the " hard-to-place " insurance market . Many drivers , especially the elderly , the young and the resident of city centers , have trouble even getting insurance coverage even though they have good driving records . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Earlier this spring Democratic Sens . Philip Hart of Michigan and Warren Magnuson of Washington introduced a bill to establish a strong national no-fault insurance program . It would pay all a victim 's medical expenses and up to $30,000 in ? death benefits . Payments for loss of income would last up to 30 months . Victims suffering economic losses exceeding $30,000 could still sue for " catastrophic " damages . Private insurance companies would operate the program but could cancel the coverage only if the policyholder lost his license or failed to pay premiums . This plan would be far stronger than the new no-fault program in Massachusetts . Under the system there , insurance company payments are limited to $2.000 and apply only to medical expenses , excluding loss-of-income compensation and death or dismemberment benefits . Through Transportation Secretary John Volpe , the Nixon administration has endorsed no-fault insurance in principle . But it has urged Congress to leave it up to the states to choose whatever no-fault legislation they want  --  if any . Advocates of the coverage promptly accused the White House of burying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged . These advocates contended the administration is knuckling under to insurance industry demands that all insurance regulation remain fragmented among the 50 states . A month ago , Mr. Volpe expressed willingness to compromise and said he " would not object " to federal standards for state-level nofault programs provided they could be established " without the federal government , in effect , taking over regulatory power . " A House of Representatives Commerce subcommittee has completed hearings on the nofault proposals . The Senate Commerce Committee is expected to complete hearings this month .
