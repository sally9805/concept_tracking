The freakish fringe of religion is changing so fast these days that fiction can not keep up with reality . Last week ABC Television presented Can Ellen Be Saved ? , a TV movie that depicted an aggressive , doctrinaire Jesus sect called the Children of Jesus . The fictitious sect was obviously a thinly disguised counterpart of the real-life Children of God , complete with a West Coast farming commune , buses that sweep into cities to pick up new converts , biblical aliases for the members and a frank affection for the money and property gleaned from converts . <P> In fact , the dramatization was more like the Children of God of two years ago ( TIME , Jan. 24 , 1972 ) . Today the Children are scattered to the four corners of the earth , preaching doom to America , buttering up Libya 's latter-day caliph , Colonel Muammar Gaddafi , and loosening up their sex ethics enough to lure new members . Only a few hundred of the 3,000 or so hard-core members remain in the U.S. The reason , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " has to do with the comet Kohoutek , which was supposed to herald catastrophe to the nation beginning on or about Jan. 31 . In the weeks before doomsday , some of the Children of God appeared in red sackcloth at United Nations Plaza in New York City warning Americans to flee . A good many of the Children took their own advice , removing themselves also from the scrutiny of New York State 's attorney general , whose charity frauds bureau last month issued a 23-page report on the sect and recommended that its questionable activities come " under the umbrella of state regulation and scrutiny . " <P> The information center for the Children of God today is London . But Leader Moses David stays as elusive as Howard Hughes , making contact with the members only in his weekly epistles called " Mo Letters " and through what might be described as fundamentalist pornography . Berg 's poem Mountin ' Maid , for instance , is 300 lines of awful doggerel urging women to bare their breasts . Sample line : Ca n't we leave those summits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight of fancy is Berg 's courtship of Libyan Strongman Gaddafi . Last spring , the Mo Letters began to talk about " godly socialism " and to describe Gaddafi as the savior who will ignite the young and rescue them from those twin sources of evil , godless Communism and American materialism . The Moslem leader , in return , has commended the C.O.G. on Libyan radio and has invited a son and daughter of Berg to visit him in Tripoli .
