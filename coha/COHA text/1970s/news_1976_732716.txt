txt Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger arrived here tonight at the start of a mediating mission in southern Africa that he hopes will convince black leaders of American sincerity in seeking peaceful solutions in South-West Africa and Rhodesia . But indicative of the skepticism that has greeted the surge of American interest in Africa in recent months , the Tanzanian Government issued a statement questioning the depth of the American commitment to black majority rule in southern Africa . Said to represent the views not only of President Julius K. Nyerere of Tanzania but also of the leaders of Botswana , Zambia , Angola and Mozambique as well , the statement asked Mr. Kissinger to declare that if peace efforts failed the United States would supply military aid to the black guerrillas . Prime Minister Ian D. Smith of Rhodesia had a four-and-a-half-hour meeting with South Africa 's Prime Minister John Vorster in Pretoria . Neither side would comment on whether Mr. Smith would be meeting Secretary Kissinger on his African trip . Page 3 .

" Mr. Kissinger , reflecting his caution of recent days , issued an arrival statement at the Kilimanjaro Hotel that said the United States was undertaking its mediation role primarily for Africans and would not continue unless " it is encouraged . " Taking note of the special interest of the so. ! called " front-line " presidents in his mission , Mr. Kissinger stressed that " every step that has brought us here has been carefully discussed with leaders in Africa and especially with the front-line - presidents .

Confers With British Official Mr. Kissinger has been cautious about . any breakthrough . Not only has he cited the problem of reconciling black and white but he has also noted the opposition to his mission by the Soviet Union . Aboard his plane , reporters were told that Soviet diplomats at the United Nations were urging African diplomats to be wary of Mr. Kissinger 's intentions . The Russians were said to be repeating the official Soviet line that Mr. Kissinger 's main goal was to find ways of keeping the white minority regir e in power .

There was a demonstration at the airport by several dozen youths waving placards attacking Mr. Kissinger and the United States . Presumably , the demonstration had the sanction of the Government . But again , this was not taken seriously by the Americans , who said that Mr. Nyerere had called Mr. Kissinger at his room in the hotel to wish him a good stay .

Kaunda before going on to South Africa on Friday .               @ @ @ @ @ @
