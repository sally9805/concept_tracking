LIKE an army repeatedly assaulting an impregnable fortress , the Dow Jones industrial average last week mounted yet another attack on the magic 1,000 mark , and once more retreated . After opening the week by pushing to a 44-month high of 974 , the index fell back to close at 966 . Such performances have become almost routine , and a different specific cause can be found for each failure to crack 1,000 . But one underlying reason is that Wall Street misses the massed investment firepower that mutual funds once brought to bear on the market . Throughout the 1960s , mutual funds , which pool the savings of more than 8,000,000 mostly small investors , regularly raised growing amounts of cash with which to purchase stock by selling more of their own shares . But now money is draining out of the funds at a startling rate . <P> In ten of the past 15 months , investors have redeemed-that is , sold back to the funds-more mutual-fund shares than they have bought . In the past six months , customers have pulled a net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting the cash instead into savings accounts , real estate investment trusts and tax-sheltered municipal bonds . That does not exactly leave the funds broke ; last year their assets exceeded $55 billion , equal to the combined assets of General Motors , General Electric , Jersey Standard and IBM . But fund managers can no longer dismiss the excess of redemptions over sales as a temporary fluke . It seems to be turning into a chronic problem that if not solved could halt for good the funds ' once dazzling growth . As a result , some funds are taking direct action . Last week in a management shake-up at Dreyfus Corp. , Chairman Howard Stein returned to his former job of running the day-to-day operations of Dreyfus Fund Inc. , the third largest mutual fund . <P> The problem is not so much too many redemptions as too few sales . Fund men believe that the rise in redemptions is at least partly the inevitable price of past success . Each month , people who became mutual-fund shareholders in the 1960s complete their investment programs and withdraw their money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funds have signally failed to find new customers to replace these dropouts . Since early 1969 , monthly sales of mutual-fund shares have been cut nearly in half .
