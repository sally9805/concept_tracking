txt " The state of Michigan has the only really comprehensive camp code in the country , " says Mitchell Kurman , a Westport , Conn. , wholesale furniture salesman . In 1965 , Mr. Kurman lost a son in a Maine canoeing accident while the boy was on a camp-sponsored wilderness trip . Since then , Mr. Kurman has become a one-man crusade for camp safety regulations . " Michigan has covered everything , " he said , " from regulating camp sites to equipment and personnel . " " The rest of the states either have little nitpicking laws that mean actually nothing , or they do n't have anything at all . " Experts generally agree that tighter camp-safety regulations are needed across the United States . Although nobody really knows for sure ( the last camp census was taken in 1920 ) , it is estimated that some 8.5 million children will be attending more than 11,000 camps this summer . Of those 11,000 , about 3,500 have been accredited by the American Camping Association ( ACA ) . The ACA is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Save for very general regulations concerning sanitation , zoning , and buildings , camps do not have to meet safety standards to operate . Nor do they have to be accredited . Regulatory guidelines are demanded of camps by only 26 states . Only five states have laws governing the minimum ages for counselors . And only 18 states require camps to be licensed . These statistics only hint at the grim situation which concerns people like Mr. Kurman . He cites Connecticut as an example of a state that has taken only ineffectual steps to remedy the problem . Connecticut recently adopted much of the model Michigan camping statute . But it then proceeded to set up an advisory board of institutional and private camps to supervise it . " That 's like setting up the Mafia to take care of crime , " commented Mr. Kurman . He says that the self-policing concept has not worked in the area of camp safety and he will willingly cite any number of camping " horror stories " to back up his contention . He would prefer the establishment of general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a camp safety bill was introduced to the Senate in 1966 by Sen. Abraham A. Ribicoff ( D ) of Connecticut . // *Camps pressed to do jobs safely // The bill calls for the secretary of health , education , and welfare to set broad youth camp-safety standards covering staff qualifications to water safety , to be supervised by the states . Such programs would be financed in part by the states and in part by federal matching grants of up to $50,000 for each state . Camps that met these federal standards would be allowed to advertise the fact . Bill stalled in committee The bill , which has the endorsement of the ACA , made its way to the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare where it was bottled up by the then committee chairman , Lister Hill ( D ) of Alabama . It was reported that Mr. Hill had " strong misgivings " about such federal regulation . But today ? four years and one committee chairman later ( the recently defeated Sen. Ralph W. Yarborough D of Texas )  --  the bill is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RibicofT bill , was introduced in the House in 1968 by Rep. Dominick V. Daniels ( D ) of New Jersey . This proposal called for a national study into the whole problem of camp safety at a cost to the government of $175,000 . The bill did make it to the floor last year . But it was narrowly defeated ( 150 to 151 ) . It has been sent back to the House Rules Committee . The reasons for such adverse reaction to the two bills are hard to determine . Many lawmakers see the proposals as a first step in the federalization of the camping industry . Another reason lies in congressional and public apathy . One congressional staff member felt that this was probably an overriding cause . Camping simply is not an important issue or industry in many states . Here are some results of camping-safety neglect : A flatbed trailer truck carrying 62 children and seven adults home from a camp-sponsored beach outing flips over on a high-speed California freeway . One counselor and four children are killed . Fifty-eight others are injured . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The accompanying counselor later explains through his tears that because he was wearing heavy motorcycle boots , he was unable to go after the boy in time . Under the permissive eye of an assistant scoutmaster a 12-year-old Boy Scout is beaten and sexually abused for four straight days by fellow Scouts while out on a wilderness trip . Seven boys are killed by an avalanche while trying to scale a treacherous peak in the Canadian Rockies  --  a mountain even experienced climbers are warned to stay away from during that particular season . What is more , the boys were alone at the time . The counselor , a Baltimore schoolteacher , had become winded and had told his group to go on without him . Canadian officials termed it one of the worst and most needless tragedies in Canadian Rockies history . Records sought The list of camp catastrophies goes on and on . But the greatest tragedy of all is that most of them easily could have been avoided . Experts generally are agreed that if the camps involved had only followed basic safety precautions , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the most critical area of the whole camp safety issue lies in camping personnel  --  especially camp counselors . " Usually these people counselors do n't stay around more than a year or two . Usually they 're young kids they the camps have picked up , " said Mr. Kurman . There are no broad state standards ? save in Michigan  --  for such occupations , he said . If he could have his way , these are the steps Mr. Kurman says he would take : 1 . He would make it mandatory for individuals to prove they were knowledgeable in the ways of the woods and waters before they could becofne counselors . And he would make it imperative that counselors in direct charge of the children have a thorough knowledge of the areas into which the children are taken . 2 . Moreover , Mr. Kurman would insist that all individuals applying for counseling jobs submit ? under oath ? mental-health records as well as any past police records . 3 . He would make it mandatory that camps be properly equipped and that certain equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it illegal for camps to send out inflated descriptions of themselves . Many camp brochures , he has found , do not conform at all with reality . And many simply accredit themselves , by affixing to their brochures a fancy-looking accreditation stamp . 5 . He would make it mandatory that all camps file , at some central recording agency , all injuries and accidents ( with particulars ) sustained at those camps . Right now , the only place such records are kept are at the police stations in which jurisdiction the accidents occur . 6 . He would insist that a Red Cross representative be present on the waterfront " at all times . " 7 . He would like all camps subjected to comprehensive inspections pursuant to licensing and frequent safety inspections thereafter .
