" We are all favored with ringside seats at the battle of the 20th ' century , the outcome of which will have greater influence on the lives of , our children , and their children , than all the military conflicts of this century put together . " I refer to the growing confrontation between the forces of globalism led by multinational enterprise and the fortresses of nationalism which have been strengthened , at least partially , as a response to the growing impact of the multinational corporation . " So ' declared Charles W. Robinson , the young president of Marcona Corporation , an international mining and transportation firm , at the fifth quadrennial International Industrial Conference ( IIC ) , which met during the week of September 17 to 21 in San Francisco . Mr. , Robinson 's prose was overblown , but the sentiments he expressed were standard fare . Sponsored by the Conference Board and the Stanford Research Institute ( SRI ) and held in the luxury hotels of Nob Hill and the board rooms of the , nearby financial district , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks and industrial firms in seventy countries , along with , a rich sprinkling of government and international , agency officials . David Rockefeller and Henry Ford , California industrialists David Packard and John McCone , Wall Street investment bankers George Ball and Teter Peterson led the list of American entrepreneurs ; similar stars brightened the roster of foreign participants . " We are , in fact , the architects and operators of the so-called ' establishment ' in our respective homelands , " IIC chairman Edgar Kaiser told them , and his welcome embraced a member of the Eastern " establishment , " as well ? Dr. lermin M. Gvishiani , deputy chairman of the Steve Weiscman works for the Pacific Study Center in East Palo Alto , Calif . He is editor of the forthcoming The Trojan Horse : The Strange Politics of Foreign Aid ( Ramparts ) . State Committee for Science and Technology of the USSR Council of Ministers and son-in-law of Premier Aleksei Kosygin . The week produced a mix of loose talk , high society and big business . Much like a flock of Midwestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours hearing panel loads of chosen colleagues read aloud already distributed papers on everything from the control of population growth in China to the control of gasoline prices in the United States . They also ' exchanged practical pointers in smaller , less formal round tables , from which the press was excluded . " The business types , really love the round tables , " a conference board official told me . " They are basically lonely men . They generally have to guard every Word . They ca n't admit they do n't know an answer . . . . In the round tables they can let their hair down . " In the evenings the participants " and their ladies " supped in formal splendor in ' the chic restaurants and elegant homes of America 's most ' cosmopolitan town . Wealth overflowed : the wife of Sony president Akio Morita was relieved of $37,000 worth of jewelry by one unconventional entrepreneur , and the honest thieves in the local tourist traps did almost as well . " The meeting offers an exchange of views , information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later become business partners , " explained Kaiser in an interview with Ralph Craib of the San Francisco Chronicle . " At the very first meeting , I met men from India and learned about their aluminum problems . . . . Today , we have a $60 million aluminum and cement operation in India . " There were no votes , no resolutions , no public commitments at the conference  --  only a $1 million marketplace of ideas and a unique opportunity to hear the public thoughts and chance conversations of a newly emerging international ruling class . The theme of this year 's IIC was " Business Enterprise and the Public Interest , " which translated into a spirited celebration of the multinational corporation ? " that most efficient instrument for optimizing the benefits of our finite global resources " ? and a defiant defense , against its many critics . Multinational business was " at bay , " the multinational businessmen warned . Host countries like Chile were staging " a frontal attack , " threatening expropriation and branding the multinationals as " dangekous agents of imperialism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their heels , " threatening measures like the Burke-Hartke bill to restrict job-exporting trade and investment ? " the most retrogressive piece of legislation since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff . " " We have even permitted , without effective contradiction , the concept to be floated that a businessman who talks to his elected representative is somehow evil , and that his voice should not be heard on matters of policy , " complained Walter B. Wriston , chairman of the $30 billion First National City Bank . But the international industrialists would not be stopped by the newly protectionist officials of organized labor , " the canny bureaucrats , " , or " yesterday 's liberals " with " their outworn doctrine of a controlled economy . " For they  --  and not their critics  --  were the ever disturbing " agents of change . " " The development of the world corporation into a truly multinational organization has produced a group of managers of many nationalities ' whose perceptions of the needs and wants of the human race know no boundaries , " Wriston explained . " They really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the payrolls and jobs furnished by the world corporation exceed profits by a factor of twenty to one . They know that there can be no truly profitable markets where poverty is the rule of life . They are a group which recognizes no distinction because of color or sex , since they understand with the clarity born of experience that talent is the commodity in shortest supply in the world , " Wall Street 's biggest banker went on to say : , - " They are managers who are against the ' partitioning of the world , not only upon a political or theoretical basis , but on the pragmatic ground that the planet has become too small and that our fate has become too interwoven one with the other to engage in the old nationalistic games that have so long diluted the talent , misused the resources , and dissipated the energy of mankind . " The new multinationalists were , in Wriston 's view , the proud descendants of the merchant princes who struggled against the medieval guilds , the free traders against the mercantilist state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19th-century imperialists and the 20th-century totalitarians . " In the ancient struggle between those who believe in an open society where men , money and ideas can move freely across national borders and those who would return to the jungle of economic nationalism , the men and women of the world corporations may furnish a new weight in the balance . " Friends of freedom , the businessmen praised the recent pursuit of peace with Russia , China and Eastern Europe , while mildly criticizing the remaining Western barriers to trade . It was hard to remember that many of ' these new enthusiasts had earlier championed the cold war , though Dr. Bernhard ' Plettner of West Germany 's giant Siemens Electric did find " the expectations associated in some quarters with East-West trade to be un- . realistic , just as unrealistic as the hope that the Soviet political and economic system will undergo a basic transformation as a result of opening up to the West . " Predictably , the multinationalists deemed themselves far ahead of their critics in understanding the need for reform , particularly in dealings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecast that the British Empire in India would founder , not on the rocks of political injustice , but of social insult . This is the problem of the multinationals , " warned Sir Ernest Woodroofe , chairman of the British-Dutch Unilever , one of the handful of corporations actually owned and controlled by citizens of more than a single country . Woodroofe 's solution was " to be as little foreign as possible without interfering with the efficiency of ' the enterprise . " He suggested a large degree of autonomy for local employees and even part ownership of subsidiaries by nationals  --  private citizens , institutions , or governments . " Although in most countries local participation has no significant bearing on the economy of the host country ; it has a significant cosmetic effect politically in some countries  --  and beauty is in the eye of the beholder , " the international soap maker explained . Woodroofe was less an internationalist when it came to labor , and particularly the formation of multinational union councils to take on the multinational corporations . " I do not see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of workers in a number of countries whose interests in investment are likely to be in conflict . Moreover , there is a real threat of damage to good industrial relations at the national level . " Woodroofe preferred to see labor negotiations " conducted by the managements of national subsidiary companies with full autonomy on the spot , " and specifically warned against " any temptation to use our multinationality to increase our power to bargain . " Strike breaking at the international level and attempts at bluff by threats of divestment will provoke the very international reactions in the unions which will ultimately stifle progress , " he predicted . Other speakers , including West Germany 's Minister of Finance Helmut Schmidt , urged an international code of conduct for the multinationals , like the unofficial International Investment Charter pioneered by SRI and the Pacific Basin Economic Council . " The multinational corporate executive  --  the new globalist  --  not only has a responsibility but a great opportunity to help bring order to international investment , " counseled Marcona 's Robinson . " The alternative is a hodgepodge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , the present reaction to the multinationals was " a global parallel " to our own turn of the ' century Populist and Progressive eras . " The small local or regional corporations suddenly leaped onto the national stage and the citizens of the United States . . brought new legislation in the form of anti-trust laws " against the " unbridled , undisciplined economic power . " Today there is " rapid development of the multinational corporations , " and " citizens of both developed and developing nations will demand a greater say in the way their lives are to be affected by international business decisions . " The problem , Robinson emphasized , is that today " there is no governmental mechanism to apply uniform policies and restrictions in the international theatre . As a result , we face a tangled web of politically inspired nationalistic responses creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear with regard to the future of both international trade and investment . " But if Robinson has his way , as did the more enlightened businessmen of the earlier " Age of Reform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , and also " establish and administer guidelines for overseas investment , and the functioning of multinational enterprise . " The IIC itself bridged the GATT ' talks in Tokyo and the IMF conference in Nairobi , and several speakers focused on the growing linkage between trade and monetary policy . Antonio Ortiz Mena , president of the Inter-American Development Bank , endorsed the widespread proposal to use special drawing rights as a chief vehicle to increase development aid , while Finance Minister Schmidt viewed the idea as a threat to monetary stability . The IIC also tried to erect ' a bridge between the environmental movement , which many of the businessmen had initially financed , and the growing concern over " the energy crisis . " " We must develop new energy and mineral resources and distribute them equitably , " urged Deputy Atty . Gen. William D. Ruckelshaus , the former director of the Environmental ProteCtion Agency . " We must conserve energy and recycle our wastes . We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must stop the growth of population and take a very critical look at economic growth itself where it serves no useful social purpose . " - It was one of the more demanding calls to action , and the Riissian Gvishiani was probably answering for his capitalist colleagues when he condemned " the modern Humanists who propose giving up economic growth . " Union Oil 's Fred Hartley was also quite impassioned , predicting sky-high prices for petroleum products , while the Saudi Arabian minister of petroleum , Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani , hinted that his government might cut back rather than increase its oil production . Yamani repeated his previous demand that oil-consumer nations pay prices high enough to finance the industrialization of Saudi Arabia , " to build a substitute for our resources when they are gone . " " Mineral and energy resources will become less assured and increasingly expensive , forcing a slowdown in economic growth rates in the , developed countries , " , explained Robinson . " We . in the United States can no longer proceed on the assumption that 6 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consume one-third of the total available resources , as is the case today . " Robinson noted that his company " is moving ahead rapidly in the development of a basic steel industry in Saudi Arabia , utilizing gas which is now being flared in that country . " The non-Arab oil producers were also represented , with high-level contingents from Iran , Venezuela and Indonesia . SRI has been particularly active in Indonesia , sponsoring an investment meeting in Djakarta right after the military seized control in the ' mid-1960s , and encouraging the Pacific-Indonesia Business Association . Several Chilean business leaders had been expected , including the chairman and the vice president of the leading pro-junta newspaper , El Mercurio . But they never arrived , much to the dismay of waiting reporters , while the interruption of air travel delayed the chairman of the U.N . Population Conference , Anthony Carillo-Flores , who had been visiting Chile at the time the military struck . Opponents of the counterrevolution did show up , however , as 200 to 250 young radicals directed a hastily scheduled demonstration against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former chief of the CIA and a director of the anti-Allende ITT . " They talk of ' corporate responsibility , ' " declared Elizabeth Farnsworth Of the Berkeley-based North American Congress on Latin America : " The working people can tell you about corporate responsibility ' ? for food prices , for gasoline shortages , for inflation . And the people of Chile can tell you about corporate responsibility , ' too  --  for the economic blockade , for the CIA , and for what the military junta called its ' Operation Djakarta . ' " Noting that Lehman Brothers ' president Peter Peterson would address the IIC that evening , Farnsworth detailed how he had organized the blockade of Chile while serving as Secretary of Commerce and chief of President Nixon 's Council on International Economic Policy . Peterson did not respond , but one well-groomed industrialist standing across the street from the demonstrators did shake his head sadly at the spectacle . " The International Industrial Conference , " he explained , " had nothing to do with politics . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
