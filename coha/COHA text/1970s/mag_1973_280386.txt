The Bible has been a source of inspiration for Marc Chagall ever since he was a boy living in the ghetto of Vitebsk in White Russia . He has drawn dozens of illustrations for the holy book During the 1960s , when he was a resident of Vence , a hill village above the French Riviera , he painted a series of radiantly colored oils depicting scenes from the Old Testament , intended to hang in several local chapels . <P> The chapels , it turned out , were too humid to house the canvases . " I do n't want to sell these paintings . I 'm going to give them to you , " Chagall told Andre Malraux , France 's Minister of Culture , whose fondness for Chagall 's work resulted in major commissions for the painter in past years , notably the decorations for the ceiling of the Paris Opera . Replied Malraux : " All right , Chagall . Then we 'll construct a building for them . " <P> That was five years ago . Last week , on the artist 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , low complex of pale gray and white alpine stone set amidst silvery olive and eucalyptus trees in the ancient Roman quarter of Nice , the new museum was built at a cost of more than $2,000,000 on three acres of land donated by the city . It is the first French museum devoted to the works of a living artist . Formally called the National Museum of the Biblical Message of Marc Chagall , it is already a new stop on the rich Riviera route for modern art tourists that includes the Leger museum in Biot , the Picasso collection in Antibes , the Matisse chapel in Vence and the Maeght Foundation in St.-Paul-de-Vence . <P> In addition to the 17 big oils , Chagall also presented the new museum with 39 gouaches and 105 engravings dating from a trip to Palestine in 1931 ( for Chagall 's most celebrated graphic project , an illustrated Bible commissioned by Art Dealer Ambroise Vollard ) . There are also a number of other works , including three stained-glass windows designed especially for the concert hall that is part of the museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm painting myself these days " ) , Chagall energetically , and critically , supervised the hanging of his works . Dismissing an awed admirer 's allusion as " Chagall 's Sistine Chapel " with a twinkling " Let 's not exaggerate , " the snowy-haired octogenarian defined his Biblical Message : " I want this place to be neither a museum nor a chapel but a place where everyone can come to pray or dream in his own way .
