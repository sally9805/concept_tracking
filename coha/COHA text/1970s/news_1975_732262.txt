txt Letters to the Editor Letters to the Editor To the Editor : We have no doubt that The Times is sympathetic to Israel 's aspirations and strongly favors the end of the ArabIsrael conflict . But repeatedly in " re- , cent months we have read in The Times ' that Israel should negotiate with the P.L.O . The Times recommends this course even though the P.L.O . refuses ' . to recognize Israel 's right to exist . Presumably , The limes assumes that negotiations with the P.L.O . will magically moderate the P.L.O . and transform it into a good neighbor . This was the point of view of those who thought . that Chamberlain'S. meetings with Hitler might hoist an umbrella of peace over Europe . ? We who have watched the ArabIsrael conflict since 1947 know that it was the Arab states which were responsible for the exodus of the Palestinians and for the elimination of the Palestine state which the U.N . had recommended and which Israel had then accepted . Avid to win the entire territory , the Arab states invaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speedy return . The U.N . itself must bear a major responsibility , , for it never really opened the road to resettlement . Instead , it encouraged the refugees to believe that they could win repatriation . It never:moved to bar the P.L.O . take-over of , the camps . It never censured Arab terrorism . Instead of promoting negotiations between Israel and Jordan , which would encompass a solution for the To Curb Prosecutors To the Editor : The reversal of the conviction of Reg Murphy 's abductor by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit , partly because of the prosecutor 's inflammatory appeal to the jury , as reported by you Nov. 29 , may be a signal that courts will curb this abuse ? in political trials as well as and most of all in those areas or eras where judges are as subject to demagogy as juries or do not have the will or courage to curb it . For political hot-war appeal in coldwar cases , one has only to scan the prosecutor 's opening and closing to the jury in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Court of Appeals here meekly swallowed , and that trial was hardly alone in this . The technique has been to blow hot to fever jury , public and judge , but also to blow some ' cold to protect the record against reversal ; that is , to use all means of inflaming , but to tell , even stress , to the jury that it should not be inflamed . Two factors compound prosecutors ' prejudicial conduct of almost any kind . One is the notion they seek to convey , particularly to juries , that their driving motivation is to secure , not convictions , but justice . The other is their virtual immunity from prosecution for misconduct of almost any but the blatantly venal kind . What clamorer for punishment of defense attorneys ' misconduct ( even though provoked ) , which is claimed to take away from.the orderliness and expeditiousness of trial , has clamored for equal application of law to prosecutors who take away liberty and even life ? Accountability for misdeed ought not to be something which stops at the law-enforcers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Justice and the Young To the Editor : In response to your Nov. 30 news story , the Citizens ' Committee for Children would like to point out that the harsh recommendations of the National Juvenile Justice Standaras Project are on the whole less harsh The Acapulco System To the Editor : Since New York is in such a major financial emergency and since millions of dollars are owed in outstanding traffic violations , I would like to suggest a quick and efficient remedy . The remedy is titled " The Acapulco System . " The Acapulco Police Department handles traffic violators very simply . It supplies its police force with screwdrivers . These law officers are then ordered to detach the license plates from any vehicle that is illegally parked . The officers return to the police station with the violator 's license plates under arm . ' The lawbreaker has- one of two options : to go to the police station and pay the fine and have his license plates returned or drive around without license plates and thereby risk arrest . Since New York City is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabat resolution which . sidetracked King Hussein . It welcomed the gun-toting Arafat to its podium . And most recently it joined in vicious demagoguery against Zionism  --  a resolution which was swiftly interpreted by the P.L.O . as legitimizing bombings in Jerusalem 's Zion Square and attacks on young Israeli students in. border settlements . The history of the P.L.O . is one of carnage . It bloodied Jordan in 1970 . It participates in the war for Lebanon . It has murdered innocent civilians in airports , homes , offices and planes in and out of Israel . Can the Israelis be blamed for defending themselves ? in view of the total disinclination of the U.N . to defend them ? from those who abjure peace and who have documented their intention to renew a genocidal war against them ? The Times transposes cause and effect . The homelessness of the Arab refugees is not the cause of the ArabIsrael conflict . It is the refusal of the Arab states to make peace with Israel that precipitated the exodus of the refugees and has prolonged their misery . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have welcomed and resettled them years ago , even as the Jews welcomed the 700,000 Jews who were forced to leave Arab lands soon after the 1948 war . I. L. KENEN President , Near East Research , Inc . Washington , Dec. 5 , 1975 than New York 's present system of juvenile justice . The project recommends putting violent sixteen- and seventeen  --  yearold children into the adult criminal court system . All other children between ten and eighteen would go through the juvenile justice system . But New York now places al/ sixteenand seventeen-year-olds accused of crime in the adult court . New York even subjects eight- and nine-year-old children to a brutalizing court process and sends them upstate to training schools . Although New York already has ' some of the most oppressive laws for children in the country , its legislators are again considering throwing fourteenand fifteen-year-olds into adult court . A similar proposal was considered and rejected by the project . We hope that our legislators , too , will reject this cruel proposal against children . ANNE WOODS GUZZARDI Coordinator , Conf. on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dec. 4 , 1975 ? On the Price of Acquittal To the Editor : I was indeed ' shocked to read the comments by former Senator Edward J. Gurney in " Notes on People " I  --  ov. 27 . There is something basically wrong with a legal system that can bankrupt a person who attempts to defend himself against a charge made by the Government and if acquitted , as was Gurney , prompts total financial disaster in trying to pay his legal tees . A much more equitable approach would be for the Government to pay the accused persons legal fees if in fact he is proven innocent . I have heard of endless cases of people who have been proven innocent of the charges leveled against them by the Government but whose joy at acquittal was gravely tempered by the realization that in gaining that freedom they are now destitute . If true justice is to prevail , the loser should foot the bill . If that were to be the case , perhaps the Government would be more discriminating in the use of its legal power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1975 sophisticated , we can go one step further and place under the windshield wiper of the vehicle a note which will tell the license-less driver to what precinct to go to pay the fine and pick up his plates . This is an immediate and rapid way to gain revenue and stop people from breaking the parking laws of this city . I also feel that the City Council will pass such an amendment . ALLEN GUTWIRTH New York , Dec. 4 , 1975 A Lawyer 's Math To the Editor : Jonathan L. Rosner 's Nov. 25 Op-Ed article ( " Lwyr Sks ** Yr " ) shows him to be reasonably articulate and , I assume , certainly a capable lawyer . However , his mathematics and tax reasoning leave something to be desired . Paying 29 percent of his gross income Lefore deductions and business expenses to the Federal Government , based upon 714 days out of a total MIcha Richter of 25 per month worked , shows that his gross income must be in the area of $75,000 at a minimum . On the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this means he worked 275 days , at a daily rate of some $275 a day .. He then proceeds to tell us that he works 11/ days to commute , or roughly $340 a month . Come now , Mr. Rosner , $340 to commute between your home in Hartsdale and your office less than two blocks from Grand Central . And on the Penn Central to boot ! And the same 11/4 days per month for Blue Cross and Blue Shield . Again the ' same $340 per month , but hoW come , since I pay $51 monthly for the same coverage , the absolute maximum that this plans offers ? Why do you pay six times what I pay for the same thing ? And I certainly congratulate you on your home , which is quite obviously well into the six figures since you are paying off the mortgage at the rate of $900 , per month , or 31/4 days ' work , for this lovely homesite . And Con Edison ? Two and threequarter days here , which conies to $760 monthly , outrageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unless , of course , you ha , ve an all-electric home and keep the lights burning 24 hours a day and your airconditioning running every day throughout the entire year , But why go on ? As for myself , I manage well and am looking forward to a 130-dy yr wth glf eery dy . SHELDON UTTAL New York , Nov. 28 , 1975 ? The Nonproducers To the Editor : It seems to me that the main problem of our times consists in the fact that increasing rationalization of industry , from the Ford belt-line to modern computers , is resulting in a condition where fewer and fewer workers and farmers are producing more and more goods . Many of us are no longer needed to produce but we are needed to consume . However , we do not create purchasing power . Hence all the measures to increase purchasing power : installment sales with more and more time to repay , credit cards , unemployment payments , additions to Social Security , Medicare , food stamps , straight welfare , standing armies ( disguised unemployment ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being issued  --  not to mention gifts and loans to foreign countries , to be continuously turned over and never repaid . All to create purchasing power for the immense amount of goods that the profit system 's cornucopia showers on us . If it were just a matter of adjusting purchasing power among those needed to consume , it would n't be so bad . But the social consequences of more ' and more people , and especially youths , kept in idleness is a matter of vital importance . In addition , some minorities , having been excluded from learning many kinds of work , are now largely in the nonproducing class ? this is an especially sore part of the problem . It is not good for people not to earn their own living , especially in their formative years . Nor is it good for workers to be supporting large numbers of nonproducers . Yet that is the condition now . Something must be done to change this . We can not permit our youths to become bums . I suggest that every youth reaching working age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all workers , except those with exceptional skill , be lowered commensurately . HENRY HOFFA Jensen Beach , Fla. , Nov. 26 , 1975 ? Our Sign Pollution To the Editor : We Itave just returned from a trip to Czechoslovakia , impressed with the country 's cultural riches and its scenic beauty . Why is this small country so beautiful ? One factor : There are no indoor or outdoor advertising signs in any of the major cities or in the small villages . Throughout our tour of Bohemia , Moravia and Slovakia , we saw only two ( small ) signs  --  one for Coca Cola and one for Pepsi Cola . There is advertising in Czechoslovak newspapers and magazines and on television , but the Government enforces its ban against signs . Why is it that we are so hopelessly trapped in our own advertising pollution in a land once called America the Beautiful ?
