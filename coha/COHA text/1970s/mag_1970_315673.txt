Whether health care in the U.S. is an organized system or a haphazard numbers game , there is no doubt whatever that it is racially biased . For most whites , medical attention is only a phone call or a car ride away . By contrast , says the nation 's top health officer , Dr. Roger O. Egeberg , Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs in the Department of Health , Education and Welfare , " it is the black Americans and other minorities for whom the ' system ' works least well . " Among blacks , the poor are a majority , and for them inadequate health care-or none-is a womb-to-tomb reality . They suffer a hugely disproportionate share of disease and premature mortality . <P> Deliberate racial discrimination is one cause . A classic case was that of Singer Bessie Smith , who was in an auto accident while driving north from singing engagements in Mississippi . After her black Samaritan driver had been turned away from white hospitals , she at last reached a hospital that was willing to admit her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , she was DOA-dead on arrival . <P> Ultimately the cause of more disability and deaths is simple neglect compounded by the inadequacy of health education classes in many public schools . A six-year-old black girl in the South dies of diphtheria because no one ever told her mother that she should have her baby inoculated against the disease-or bothered to make sure that she did it . In fact , says Egeberg , more than 20% of nonwhite children have failed to get the standard shots against diphtheria , tetanus and whooping cough ( a combination " DTP " vaccine ) , while 91.4% of all white children have had them . A boy is deaf in one ear because his mother could not take him to the clinic for a second treatment of a common ear infection ; to make the first visit , she had to take her five children on two different buses to a distant clinic , where she waited all day for a doctor to see the boy . A woman who lives in a rat-infested slum says that rats are no problem : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual that day . <P> Survival First . Health services are rationed according to purchasing power rather than need , and so are least available to those who need them most . Says Egeberg : " The poor suffer a great deal more infectious disease , go to the hospital more often , and stay there longer " - if they can afford to get to a hospital . As Permon Johnson , a student at Nashville 's predominantly black Meharry Medical College , puts it : " The average poor black adult places survival ahead of medical attention . He comes to the hospital only when he 's on his last legs . He does n't know anything about his medical needs or his right to medical attention . "
