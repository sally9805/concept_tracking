ONLY six weeks ago , Washington cautiously listed Cambodia as a possible plus in its Indochina ledger . No one had much faith in Premier Lon Nol 's vows to clear 40,000 Communist troops from their sanctuaries near the Viet Nam border ; still , it was thought that the new regime could be counted upon to make life difficult for the enemy , if nothing else . But the Cambodian army has proved weaker than anyone expected , and the new regime , far from giving the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong trouble , has mainly been giving them ground . <P> Surging out of the border jungles that had served them as sanctuaries for years while Prince Norodom Sihanouk was in power , Viet Cong and North Vietnamese bands seemed to be all over a broad swath of southern and eastern Cambodia , and heading for the national capital of Phnom-Penh . In Takeo province , 50 miles south of the capital , they battled Cambodian soldiers at Ang Tasom and Takeo , the provincial capital , closing two key highways linking Phnom-Penh with southern ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew up a bridge and occupied a town in Kratie province . Another force , attacking by boat , raided the upper-crust Cambodian resort of Kep on the Gulf of Siam , where they set fire to municipal buildings and killed several civilians before escaping to sea . <P> <P> Everywhere the Communists seemed to be able to move with impunity . The attack that really lent urgency to Lon Nol 's requests for outside military aid ( see THE NATION ) was a show of Communist power and Cambodian impotence at Saang , a handsome French provincial town only 15 miles south of Phnom-Penh on the west bank of the Bassac River . For five days , a Viet Cong and North Vietnamese force of undetermined size-perhaps only 100 men-held the town against a force of 4,000 Cambodian troops , who arrived in a fleet of commandeered buses and trucks . Only after the Cambodians had plastered Saang with artillery , mortar fire and air attacks for four days did they dare enter the half-destroyed town . It was empty . <P> The siege of Saang was a sharp reminder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops there had been in uniform for less than a month . It also illustrated that the new government 's hate campaign against Vietnamese nationals has not abated . At one point , the Cambodians marched a column of 100 Vietnamese Catholics into Saang in order to expose Communist positions ; several were cut down in the expected hail of enemy fire . As similar atrocities continued last week , the Saigon government dispatched officials to Phnom-Penh to negotiate possible repatriation of the 500,000 Vietnamese living in Cambodia . <P> Unreality . Saang is only a fast 20-minute drive from Phnom-Penh , but a curious air of unreality prevailed in the Cambodian capital . Even as Lon Nol was desperately dickering for arms , his brother Lon Non , a member of the government , was telling newsmen , " We are not worried . The Vietnamese attacks amuse us . We can hold out for years . "
