" The officers of these unions answer directly to , or are actual lieutenants in , the syndicate , " he said . " There are ether unaffiliated local unions which are also controlled by the syndicate . The degree of corruption in the labor movement in Chicago is among the worst in the country . " VAIRA WAS asked by Sen.
