txt In a crucial setback for the antiwar movement in Congress , the House of Representatives rejected today an amendment demanding the withdrawal of all American forces from Indochina . The vote of 228 to 178 was a major victory for the Adminlistration , which had lobbied intensively to defeat the Vietnam troop-withdrawal amendment that the House Foreign Affairs Committee had attached to a $2.1-billion foreign aid bill . In view of the House action , it now seemed improbable that any " end-the-war " legislation would be passed in this session of Congress . The House went on to pass the foreign aid bill by a vote of 221 to 172 . The bill 's authorization of $2.1-billion in military assistance in the current fiscal year is about $200-million less than the amount requested by the Administration . A similar foreign aid bill was killed in the Senate last month after an amendment on ending the war was attached . Stand Seems Decisive The Senate earlier this month attached an amendment to a military procurement bill that through a cut-off of funds would require withdrawal of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners of war , and it is likely that the Senate will add the same amendment to the foreign aid bill when it is received from the House . With the decisive position taken by the House , however , all such Senate amendments are now likely to die in a Senate-House conference committee . The 50-vote margin represented a loss of strength from last October far House critics of the Vietnam war policy . At that time in a procedural action the House voted 215 to 193 to instruct House conferees not to accept a troop-withdrawal amendment approved by the Senate . In advance of today 's vote , a White House aide predicted , " if we win by 40 votes or more , end-the-war legislation is dead for this session . " House doves contributed to their own defeat because they were divided over what deadline to set for the withdrawal . As approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee , the amendment demanded a termination of all hostilities and withdrawal of all American forces by Oct . I , subject to release ' of prisoners of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safe withdrawal of the troops . The Oct. 1 deadline was set several months ? ago ? when the amendment was first being drafted by its co-sponsors ? Representatives Lee H. Hamilton , Democrat of Indiana , and Charles W. Whalen Jr. , Republican of Ohio . Change in Deadline Sought In an attempt to pick up added votes for the amendment , Representative Whalen moved on the floor to change the deadline to Dec. 31 . Administration forces taunted supporters of the " end-the-war " amendment , saying they were proposing to " extend the war by another 90 clays . " The change in the deadline was also opposed by some of the more outspoken doves , such as Representative Benjamin S. Rosenthal , Democrat of Queens , and Representative Ronald V. Dellums , Democrat of California . In what was to be a critical test vote , some of the doves thus lined up with opponents of the amendment to reject an extension of the deadline by a vote of 304 to 109 . With that , the doves lost the support of Speaker Carl Albert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom had voted for extension of the deadline . With the White House successful in holding the Republican ranks almost solid in opposition to the amendment , the votes of the two Democratic leaders had been regarded as crucial in swinging over some moderate Democrats . As appraised by an official of Common Cause , the organization that mounted a nationwide lobbying campaign for the amendment , the outcome depended in large measure upon some 50 Democrats , most of ; l them committee chairmen or subcommittee chairmen and thus part of the Democratic Establishment , which has tended to support the President on foreign policy issues . The two Democratic leaders were under intense political pressure , from their own Democratic ranks to support the amendment , particularly in light of the action of the House Democratic caucus in April in calling for legislation providing a prompt termination of the war . It was the caucus action that influenced the once-hawkish House Foreign Affairs Committee to adopt the troop-withdrawal amendment . Right up to the debate , the two Democratic leaders remained publicly uncommitted on how they would vote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then with the decision not to extend the deadline , Representative Boggs came out publicly against the amendment . Noting that it was unlikely that the foreign aid bill would be enacted before Oct. 1 , ' Mr , Boggs roared from the well of the House : " I am not going to stand here and do something that is a vain and useless thing and could be misinterpreted around the world . " Mr. Albert also then voted to strike the amendment from the bill . The only member of the Democratic leadership to vote for the amendment was Representative Thomas P. O'Neill Jr . of Massachusetts , the majority whip , who led the move to place the Democratic caucus on record in favor of legislation to end the war . Among the doves , there also ' was some bitterness directed ! to Representative Thomas E. Morgan , the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , for insisting that the first vote conic on whether to change the withdrawal deadline ? ? The cloves had felt they would be in a stronger position if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subsequent vote on changing the deadline . Position Held Unclear Mr. Morgan had supported the amendment in committee , but in the maneuvering on the floor , some doves felt he had worked to the advantage of the Administration . ' The move to strike the amendment from the bill was led by Representative Richard Bolling , Democrat of Missouri , who argued that in a Government of divided powers " there is no way Congress can make the President accept terms he finds unacceptable " and " it is a cruelty to the American people to pretend otherwise . " By voice vote , the House accepted an amendment by Representative Ogden R. Reil , Democrat of Westchester , authorizing the President to suspend foreign aid to any nation that refuses to prosecute or extradite plane hijackers when requested to do so by the United States . The House , by a vote of 253 to 140 , also struck out a committee amendment restoring to the President authority to ban the importation of Rhodesian chrome in compliance with a United Nations embargo . The President 's authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in legislation passed last year by Congress .
