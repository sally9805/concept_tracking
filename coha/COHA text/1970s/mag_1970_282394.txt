NATHANAEL WEST : THE ART OF HIS LIFE by Jay Martin . 435 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $10 . <P> <P> Nathanael West habitually wore what he called " the smile of an anarchist . . . with a bomb in his pocket . " He also carried the bomb . During the ' 30s , West flipped two high-explosive satires ( Miss Lonelyhearts , The Day of the Locust ) at Middle America . Hardly anybody noticed . His four novels , which took 14 years to write ( 1924-1938 ) , earned him exactly $1,280 in royalties . Twenty years after his shocking death he was recognized as the finest and blackest American humorist since Mark Twain went to his bitter end . Now , a young California English professor has at last accorded West his first full-length biography . Awed by his subject 's brilliance and self-sealing reserve , Martin is too chary with his insights and interpretations . But he offers a thousand facts never printed before , and he places West just right as an apocalyptic passerby-one of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faceless crowd and to chronicle its pain and baffled rage . <P> Nathan Weinstein was West 's real name . His father was a wealthy New York building contractor and the boy was spoiled rotten . He cut school several days a week and lounged around , soaking his head in delusions of athletic grandeur and working up torture projects in the style of Poe . In ninth grade he flunked everything , after the tenth he dropped out of high school . He entered Tufts College on a forged transcript , and when he was busted out a couple of months later he forged another and was admitted to Brown as a second-term sophomore . <P> Ortolans and Failure . For the next 2 years it was girls , flasks and sis-boom-bah . But the public image concealed an all-night reader who forged through Flaubert , Rimbaud , Joyce , Proust , Eliot , Pound , Cummings , Stein , Hemingway . In the fall of 1926 , with a wad in his wallet and a life of leisure in view , he changed his name to Nathanael West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was going to be ortolans all the way . But that winter the family fortune showed signs of imminent collapse . Early in 1927 , West found himself working as night manager in a seedy little Manhattan hotel on 23rd Street called Kenmore Hall ; later , he moved uptown as manager of the shabby-genteel Sutton Club Hotel . <P> In disaster , it would seem , West found his will to write . In the hotels , he found his subject . He saw them as zoos of failure , terminal wards filled with " dismantled innocents " who had lost the battle for survival in a machine civilization . With the skinned eyes of poverty , he saw that he too might someday lose the battle and wind up on the other side of the desk . Horrified , fascinated , wrung with love , he watched his tenants like a man watching himself die in a mirror . He chatted with them endlessly : he steamed open their letters and read their secrets ; and through long , lonely nights in hotel offices , he braided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
