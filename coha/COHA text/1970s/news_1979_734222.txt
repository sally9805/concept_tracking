txt deleted page feller Sr. , the founder of Standard Oil , gave $550 million to establish the Rockefeller Foundation and what is now Rockefeller University , along with support for other causes . The philanthropies of his s ? e , John D. Jr. , have been tallied at $552 million. ? Of the third generation , only two brothers survive ? Laurance S. , suggested by some close associates as the current leader of the family , and David . Nelson died last January , John D. 3d last July and Winthrop , a former Governor of Arkansas , in 1973 . After the death of Winthrop , it was amid intimations of their own mortality that the surviving Rockefeller brothers had a study made on institutions with which they had had a " long and special relationship . " The study , completed only last October , was conducted by a committee headed by Dana S. Creel , who was then the president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund . It resulted in the financial commitments totaling $75 million to 20 causes in 1977 and 1978 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there could still be operating help from the fund , historically most of such grants have run only between $5,000 and $50,000 at a time . The special gifts included a $15 million five-year grant to Rockefeller University , with a potential $7.5 million more if self-help conditions are met . Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center was also awarded $15 million with a potential $2.5 million more to be based on matching conditions . Other special grants included $10 mil= lion for the Museum of Modern Art , of which the brothers ' mother was a founder in 1929 ; $4 million for Colonial Williamsburg , their father 's great historic restoration , and $7.4 million for the Population Council and $3 million for the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts , both special causes of John D. Rockefeller 3d . The fabulous Rockefeller family wealth has also been passing to the fourth generation , in which 23 cousins share what still are comfortable fortunes for themselves and their families .

Jr. , current president is Nelson 's daughter , Ann Rockefeller Roberts . Robert W. Scrivner , the fund 's director , says all the cousins have been involved except Nelson 's sons Nelson Jr . and Mark , who , at 14 and 12 respectively , are too young . Last December , the Family Fund received its first trustee from the fifth generation , Gail O'Neill , granddaughter of the brothers ' only sister , the late Abby Rockefeller Mauze . Family Fund grants tend to be small . The areas of interest have been conservation , equal opportunity for women , education and institutional awareness . A fifth area ? arts and public esthetics ? was phased out in mid-1977 . For the last two years , a special program has involved wilderness preservation in Alaska . Assets of the Family Fund at the start of this year were $11.5 million , with the 1979 budget set at $1.6 million , somewhat above expected income . The potential deficit , Mr. Scrivner says , is because the fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the fund 's aid and qualify for help from other foim-rlatinnq Brothers Aid New York City The Rockefeller Brothers Fund , which dates from 1940 , makes grants in three categories ? national , international and New York City . The last is to improve the quality of life in its home community by " encouraging more comprehensive , efficient and publicly accountable approaches " to arts and culture , economic development , housing and community development , human services and public education . Laurance Rockefeller , the senior sur . viving brother , is chairman , and David Rockefeller is chairman of the executive committee . The three other brothers and their sister had been trustees before their deaths . Blanchette Rockefeller , the wife of John D. 3d , was elected a trustee in March . The 15-member board of trustees includes four members from the fourth generation ? Neva R. Kaiser and David Rockefeller Jr . ( David 's children ) , Abby M. O'Neill ( Mrs. Mauze 's daughter ) and Steven C. Rockefeller ( Nelson 's son ) . There are seven nonfamily members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be filled at the annual meeting next month . Grants Coupled With Challenges At the end of 1978 , the market value of the fund 's assests was estimated at $169.7 million . During that year , the Brothers Fund paid out $9,985,000 in its regular operation , which included 160 grants . In the special capital-grants program growing out of the brothers ' hope to assure the future of their special causes , it paid out $10 million to 11 institutions . Among the special grants coupled with challenges that they be matched , in part , by other fund-raising was one to Rockefeller University . The university ? successor to the first institution to bear the family name , the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research ? was started in 1901 and was transformed into a university in 1965 . David Rockefeller succeeded his father as chairman of the board of trustees , serving from 1950 until 1975 . Since then , he has been chairman of the executive committee . University 's Accomplishments The university credits itself with the first isolation and testing of natural antibiotics , advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfusions , development of a way to preserve whole blood so that blood banks became possible , demonstrating that animal cancer can be caused by a virus and developing methadone maintenance as a treatment for heroin addiction . Until the early 1950 's , Rockefeller University largely survived on its endowment from John D. Sr. and John D. Jr . ? its current investments of about $180 million have almost all been derived from their gifts . Much of its expansion since then has come from Federal grants , which went up to about 42 percent of the budget for the year ended last June O. The university began seeking to broaden its base of private support in 1971 , according to Rodney W. Nichols , executive vice president . Currently , he says , it has had to set a private fund-raising goal in the $100 million range for the rest of this year and the early 1980 's . Conditions for Support From the Rockefeller Brothers Fund , it has a grant of $15 million , with a promise of $7.5 million more after Dec. 31 , 1983 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the university must add $25 million to its present reserves in new money , which might include all or part of the $15 million grant . Second , the $7.5 million can only be drawn on by matching contributions from other private sources . Both conditions must be satisfied by Dec. 31 , 1986 , to get the entire additional amount . Another great philanthropic cause of John D. Sr. was the Rockefeller Foundation , established in 1913 . It has figured in the Brothers Fund 's special grants only in connection with a $2 million grant to its Archive Center , which is taking over documents of the family . " The foundation has been essentially separated from the family for a good many years , " according to Sterling Wortman , senior vice president . The separation occurred even though John D. Rockefeller 3d was a trustee , beginning in 1931 , and the chairman from 1952 until his retirement at the age of 65 in 1971 . He became chairman " simply because he earned it , being one of the more active members of the board , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masses ' " His leverage and thought were exerted back in the 50 's and 60 's when the current program was established , " Mr. Wortman says . " He took the idea that the foundation was set up to promote the well-being of mankind quite literally . He was always bringing us back to the central concern of the welfare of great masses . " John D. Rockefeller 3d 's son , Gov . John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia , was an active trustee from 1968 to 1977 , leaving when he became Governor . But he was induced to return last year . The Rockefeller Foundation 's great efforts have included the fight against disease ? hookworm in the South and abroad , yellow fever ( against which it developed a vaccine ) and malaria in Brazil . For the so-called green revolution , it helped develop new varieties of corn and wheat that doubled Mexico 's food production between 1943 and 1963 and that were adopted elsewhere . It also sponsored research on rice for Asia . Rockefeller Foundation spending has exceeded $1.375 billion since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that year with assets valued at $744 million . $15 Million for Sloan-Kettering Major programs in recent years have been in several areas ? arts ; humanities and contemporary values ; equal opportunity ; conquest of hunger ; international relations ; population and health ; education for development , and quality of the environment . The last two categories are to be phased out in the next few years . Among commitments in the Brothers Fund capital grants , Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center is to get $15 million outright , the same as Rockefeller University . The center is on land between 67th and 68th Streets from York to First Avenue that was donated by John D. Rockefeller Jr . in 1927 . Laurance Rockefeller has been the brother most interested in that cause , with his sister , Mrs. Mauze , also having made large financial contributions , and her daughter , Abby O'Neill , also active . The Brothers Fund challenge allows the cancer center $2.5 million more after 198.3 , provided that the center adds $25 million to its present reserves , which might include all or part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be matched dollar for dollar up to a Dec. 31 , 1986 , deadline . For the Museum of Modern Art , the $10 million Brothers Fund grant is to assist in construction of its new building with a challenge to build up endowments , and with $175,000 for planning . Nelson Rockefeller 's will left the museum 23 paintings and four sculptures , appraised at $8.5 million . The museum says these will be accommodated like other new acquisitions without special security or maintenance problems . The $4 million capital grant to Colonial Williamsburg was one of a series of family grants since John D. Rockefeller Jr . co-founded the Virginia enterprise in 1926 . His will left about $65 million to it in 1960 ; the Brothers Fund gave $4 million in 1967 ; Martha Baird Rockefeller , their father 's widow , left $5 million on her death in 1971 , and their brother Winthrop bequeathed $1 million in 1973 to continue work on the Carter 's Grove Plantation . From John D. Rockefeller 3d 's will , Ca lonial Williamsburg has just received the 545-acre Bassett Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ' $4.4 million , along with $700,000 worth of furnishings . Church Must Finance Program Riverside Church was given $750,000 under the Brothers Fund special-grants program . The interdenominational church 's site and construction were financed by John D. Rockefeller Jr. , who , according to the Rev. William Sloane Coffin , senior minister , also gave the bulk of an endowment ? now valued at $40 million ? to maintain the building . This has left the church only to raise its program costs ? now $400,000 out of an overall $1 million annual budget ? from its 2,400 members and others . " Thanks to the generosity of John D. Rockefeller Jr. , " Mr. Coffin says , " it is now possible for poor people to run the church ? and many do . " The Brothers Fund capital-grants program has given $1.54 million to the Asia Society , of which $1 million is to help in its new building planned for Park Avenue and 70th Street for purposes apart from the $10 million Oriental-art collection John D. Rockefeller 3d left it in his will . Executors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fulfill a pledge toward the building he had made but had not yet specifically written into his will . Lincoln Center , of which John D. 3d was president at the start and then chairman , got a $3 Million Brothers Fund special grant last October , and its Metropolitan Opera Association constituent has received $1.5 million . The Japan Society , another cause for John D. 3d , received $1.5 million , and the Ramon Magsaysay Foundation received $1 million . Mr. Magsaysay had impressed John D. 3d while Philippine Minister of Defense when they met during the campaign against the Huk rebellion . They last met in 1957 , before the then Philippine President was killed in an airplane crash . The Brothers Fund gave $500,000 in 1957 for the Magsaysay Foundation to establish awards and gave $1 million more in 1963 . It also lent $2 million to construct a building in Manila in 1968 . The building 's rental income now helps finance five annual prizes to persons or institutions in Asia for government ' public and community service ; journalism ; literature and creative communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prizes , the awards ? first $10,000 each , currently $20,000 ? have gone to such recipients as the Dalai Lama of Tibet ; Jayaprakash Narayan and Vinoba Bhave , India 's crusaders for social justice , and the United States Peace Corps volunteers in Asia . Other Causes Brothers Aided Other causes sharing in the Brothers Fund capital grants have included : 41The Center for Inter-American Relations , of which David Rockefeller has been chairman , $1 million . 9The Metropolitan Museum of Art , $350,000 to help with the primitive-arts collection . The Brothers Fund had previously granted $1 million to help construct the Michael C. Rockefeller Memorial 1 Wing of Primitive Art , a tribute to Nelson 's son who lost his life in New Guinea in 1961 . Nelson 's will bequeathed the wing 1,610 primitive-art pieces valued at more than $5 million . ? ( lInternational House , whose chairmanship David took over from his father in 1946 , $500,000 . These days , Laurance Rockefeller has been helping a campaign to raise $20 million for the New York Zoological Society , of which John D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive has already received $1 million from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund . Mr. Rockefeller , who turned 69 yesterday , appealed for that cause before one audience recently : " Let me ask all of you to seriously consider including a bequest to the Zoological Society in your wills .
