txt You ca n't move the Indian reservation to the city . But you ca n't move the city 's jobs to the eservation , either . So more and more Indians are heading cityward ? exchanging trees and open spaces for concrete blocks . Like Rod Bernard , who got tired of living by government handouts on his Canadian reserve . With no money , no trade , and eight years of schooling , he came to Boston . It did n't take long to discover that city life was going to be different . You have to learn the little things  --  how to take a bus , how to find your way through the food stores , and how to be at work by 8 . That 's a lot to ask of a man who grew up on " Indian time " ? always far behind city clocks . Rod has n't found the Job to make him independent . For him , the move to the city only changed the name of the agency giving him a relief allowance . There are thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . Experts say there may be as many Indians living in the towns and cities as on the reservations Many give up " Some of these city dwellers find construction work and a few , office jobs . For others the shock of the new life is too great : homesickness draws them back to the reserve Many , says Rod , " give up and start drinking . " At a center for Boston 's alcoholics on the city 's South End , Rod sits on the fringes beside fellow Indians who know that route While the non-Indians talk about how they are trying to fight the- bottle , the Indians listen , but i arely speak . The meeting ends . The Indians gather , laughing and talking together , alteinating English with a tribal tongue . Latecomers drift in And the visitor begins to see N. , hat  --  besides drinking  --  brings the Indians to the center . " Indians do n't like to express their feelings to non-Indians , ? " said a young woman with an accent hinting she would be more comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused " I do n't think they realize what w e need . " " Only an Indian understands an Indian , " explained another Boston Indian And across the countiy Indians say the same thing Language barrier " An Indian would rather go to an Indian than to a non-Indian fur help , " says Frank Love , an Omaha , who heads the American Indian Center in Omaha , Neb Often an Indian is too proud or too shy to ask help at an agency Sometimes even language is a barrier So the Omaha group and 53 Indian centers like it have sprung up in Ameiican cities to tell the Indians , " This place is for you . " In Omaha , this means Indians helping Indians find housin:z and lobs . In Minneapolis , the Indians found that police arrested 20 or so of their people every week  --  usually for drunkenness . The Indian group there gave out lists of trouble spots for Indians to avoid and set up Indian patrols to watch out for Indians in trouble For 22 weeks after the program began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the informal group of Indians at the alcoholic center has spawned a new citywide Indian council to speak for the city 's little-noticed native Americans . Drum and chants Already the Boston Indians touch the city with Indian ways . If you happen into a certain Unitarian church building some Friday night in downtown Boston , you can Join the dance around the big drum and listen to the low , di oning chants . In Boston , and everywhere , money is a problem for the Indian groups . In eight cities , the centers get federal help . The rest fend for themselves . But the Indian groups face other hurdles , too . Since Indians rarely live in " ghetto " arrangements , oc-garazing their scattered people is ! laid . Their email numbers are often swallowed up by the city . Tribes , too , divide their tanks To most Indians , being Indian is not so important as being a Cherokee , a Sioux , or a Lumbee , says the head of Baltimore 's Indian center . In Boston , the Mohawks , Passamaquoddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves But the Indians are few and cities at e big . The Indians are finding that they must join together . Ask Rod Bei nand what tribe a friend is , and he 'll tell you , " It does n't matter . He 's an Indian . " That spirit may mean hope for future Rod Bernards who make their way to the city .
