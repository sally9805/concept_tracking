Inside the city itself , house-to-house fighting erupted around the central marketplace when rebel infiltrators suddenly surfaced . Using armored scout cars that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the governor 's mansion and its important helicopter pad . Despite insurgent gains , the government said at week 's end that it could hold the town , however , and the outcome of the battle was still in doubt .
