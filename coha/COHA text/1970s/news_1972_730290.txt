txt If George McGovern makes it , it will not be without a great deal of last-minute suspense . The hush of expectancy ? or is it anxiety ? ? that lies over this convention city follows the Supreme Court 's decision to throw the two highly controversial delegation - seating questions , California and Illinois , back into the lap of the convention . Ironically , the court actually had to intervene itself in the happenings of the convention toprevent lower courts from intervening here . What the Supreme Court has done might even have the effect of deciding the Democratic presidential nomination . In any event , what looms as an almost certain possibility is a convention fight over credentials that could leave the Democratic Party divided much as it was four years ago . Should this occur , there may be those who will say the Supreme Court ? more than anything else ? set the stage for a weakening of the party that made President Nixon 's reelection inevitable . // *Key vote : What 's a ' majority ' ? // McGovern backers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumper stickers . It is easy to get the impression that the South Dakota Senator is the only candidate running . This of itself is a reminder of the multitude of Democrats who will be disappointed and angered if their man is denied a nomination they think he has unquestionably earned . But if the stop-McGovern move is to prevail here , at least on the first ballot , it will have to be able to muster a majority vote to support the Credentials Committee ruling that stripped Senator McGovern of 151 California delegates . These same anti-McGovern forces will also be heavily involved in trying to reseat the Richard Daley delegation in Illinois . Should this be accomplished , it would pull another 40 to 50 delegates from Senator McGovern . At this point , the race for the nomination comes down to this : ? As of now Mr. McGovern seems to be from 160 to 200 votes short of a first-ballot victory . ( A total of 1,509 is needed to win the nomination . ) Should the Senator be able to win back the California delegates on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so ? his nomination would appear to be a certainty . ? The role of the temporary convention chairman , Lawrence F. O'Brien , now becomes extremely important . The anti-McGovern people would like a ruling by Mr. O'Brien that would give recognition to the California challenge before that of Illinois . Who votes on California ? They would further hope Mr. O'Brien would rule that none of the contested California delegation will be permitted to vote on the California challenge . The McGovern people contend that those delegates not taken away from them by the Credentials Committee ( 120 ) were never under challenge and that therefore they should be permitted to take part in the floor vote on who should constitute the California delegation . The McGovernites say they are certain of winning back all 271 California delegates  --  and the nomination ? if this ruling ( plus one other ) is obtained : that a majority of those voting and not an absolute majority ( 1,509 ) is needed to overturn the Credentials Committee 's seating decisions . As this is being written , indications were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those voting will be needed . ? Both McGovern and anti-McGovern forces concede that the outcome of the first big challenge will probably set up a momentum that will helpthe winner to triumph in the second challenge case . Question of momentum That is , should Mr. McGovern lose the first contest ( say it is California since it comes before Illinois alphabetically , giving Mr. O'Brien a logical reason for , choosing this sequence ) , then the momentum of the convention will be running against Mr. McGovern . He could be more likely to lose the Daley challenge . But should he win the first contest , his victory in the second fight would be almost certain , it seems . ? Behind the scenes here there is an effort spearheaded by a number of governors to try to work out a compromise on the challenges and thus avoid a heated , divisive floor fight . But up to now , Mr. McGovern says he wo n't give an inch on his demand ? for the return of the 271 California delegates . And his offer to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daley organization , in return for peace , has , he says , been rebuffed by Mayor Daley . The Daley risk Some sort of rapprochement with Mr. Daley is of utmost importance to Senator McGovern . He knows that should he win the nomination by walking over Daley and his men , he might as well forget about any chance of winning Illinois next fall . No statewide Democratic candidate can - win in Illinois without Mayor Daley getting out the vote for him in Cook County ( Chicago ) , many believe  --  although this is disputed by the challengers to Mr. Daley.
