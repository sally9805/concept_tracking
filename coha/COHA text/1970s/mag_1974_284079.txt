The evening began with Missouri Congressman James Symington quipping , " We have been brought together by the big enchilada of the Democratic Party . " Some 750 Democrats , including Senators Hubert Humphrey , George McGovern , Ted Kennedy , Ed Muskie and " Scoop " Jackson , paid $125 for dinner at Washington 's Sheraton-Park Hotel to honor Elder Statesman Averell Harriman , 82 , and raise money for party candidates . There was also a Republican maverick . Describing herself as " just an old , broken-down Bull Moose , " Alice Roosevelt Longworth , 90 , said the dinner was . her first-ever Democratic bash . Marking Harriman 's 40-year career as a politician and diplomat under four Presidents were members of their families : Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. , Margaret Truman Daniel , Lynda Bird Johnson Robb and a special friend , Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis , to whom he lent his Georgetown house after President Kennedy was killed . As the band played Auld Lang Syne , Jackie capped her first political appearance in Washington in eleven years with a rare speech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many of my old friends to honor someone unique in the history of our country , " she said , " Who else has served us so long and so well ? " <P> Biking with a friend to a tennis lesson in Manhattan 's Central Park , John F. Kennedy Jr. , 13 , was mugged . A strapping youth , aged about 18 , stepped into the boys ' path , brandished a stick at John and said , " Get the hell off the bike . " When John did not respond quickly enough , the thief knocked him to the ground , grabbed his tennis racket and sped off on his $145 ten-speed Bianchi racer . Secret Service men , who are charged with John 's protection until his 16th birthday , were red-faced . Apparently John had passed up a ride in the Secret Service car , jumped on his bicycle and headed off on a path where the car could not follow . A New York City parks department official groaned , " Six million people in the park , and the mugger had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Philosophers Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre drew fire last week-from South Viet Nam . Beauvoir and Sartre , along with a group of fellow French intellectuals , appealed to the next French government to recognize the Viet Cong 's Provisional Revolutionary Government and further to recognize the exiled Prince Sihanouk as the rightful ruler of neighboring Cambodia . <P> Miffed , South Viet Nam 's spokesman Bui Bao True declared , " Mr. Sartre and Miss de Beauvoir have always had a reputation of demanding the legitimization of illegal acts , crimes and bad actions . " <P> He added inaccurately , " They themselves have set an example of illegality by cohabiting as an illegal couple . " In fact , the two great friends have separate apartments .
