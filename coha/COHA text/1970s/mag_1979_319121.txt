September 1979 may well go down in diplomatic history as the month that the U.S. Government went a little bit haywire . Both the Executive and Legislative branches have overreacted to the belated discovery of a Soviet combat brigade in Cuba and have severely jeopardized rational consideration of the SALT II treaty . The events of the past four weeks provide a case study in the breakdown of constitutional process whereby the Administration and Congress are supposed to be partners in statesmanship . <P> The intelligence community , finally recovered from its obsession with Cuba of the 1960s , had recently consigned the island to its peripheral vision and focused instead on what seemed more important tasks , like monitoring the tests of new Soviet intercontinental missiles . Then , re-examining evidence that it had been sitting on for a long time , the CIA changed its opinion about the exact nature of Soviet military manpower in Cuba . <P> Contrary to assurances that Secretary of State Cyrus Vance had already given the Senate , the agency concluded that about one-third of the 6,000 to 9,000 Russians on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technicians . <P> What upset the intelligence analysts was not that they had exposed some new and perfidious Soviet menace but that they had failed to notice a brigade that had been there for years . What upset the Carter Administration was not the intelligence failure but an acute political problem . Vance had inadvertently misled the Senate . <P> So the Administration decided to seize the initiative in the inevitable controversy . <P> Rather than let Senator Henry Jackson exploit the issue to scuttle SALT or Senator Howard Baker to ingratiate himself with the Republican right , the Administration would give a senatorial ally , Idaho 's Frank Church , a sneak preview of the information and thus offer him an opportunity to go public with it . That way , he might be a principal arbiter of an acceptable Soviet explanation for the brigade . But Church , facing tough conservative opposition to his reelection next year , panicked . The Senate would not ratify SALT , he proclaimed , until the Soviet brigade had been removed . <P> No way will the Soviets oblige . They are notoriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what the carrots . In 1974 the Kremlin made clear that it would rather live without most-favored-nation status than submit to " Scoop " Jackson 's condition of increased emigration of Jews . Soviet sensitivities are a matter not only of international pride but also of intramural Kremlin politics . Nikita Khrushchev lost his job partly because the Kennedy Administration forced him to remove Soviet missiles from Cuba in 1962 . <P> Almost everyone acknowledges that the Soviet brigade does not violate the 1962 Soviet-American agreement that ended the Cuban missile crisis . Nor does it come anywhere near as close to straining the spirit of that agreement as did the berthing of Russian atomic submarines in Cuba in 1970 ( see Kissinger : White House Years ) or the stationing of MiG-23s on the island in 1978. * Nor is the brigade plausibly a strike force for an assault on Guatemala or Key West . Nor did it arrive recently enough to be a deliberate , mischievous test of Jimmy Carter 's will . Nor does it have anything to do with the issues in SALT .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
