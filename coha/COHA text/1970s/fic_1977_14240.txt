The audience is assembled in the amphitheatre . The orchestral overture begins and the audience lights go down and out . A narrative and interpretative VOICE comes in , rich and energetic . GAIL BORDEN ( announcingly ) Galveston  --  city by the sea , City of history , we salute you ! Galveston , the gateway to the new Texas  --  Gateway to the new day , To man 's purpose and his doing  --  To man 's affirming and his might , The stalwart , daring man , Striking , pushing , marching , building  --  Feeling the battle , tasting the victory  --  Defiant in defeat  --  saying  --  I am here ! ( The music swells , then goes down and continues in accompaniment . ) GAIL BORDEN ( Continues with a change of tone . ) In the beginning was the land , And the reaching sky above the land  --  And the waters outspreading  --  The muscled winds , greedy and clamorous , Tearing , wearing the patient earth , The Galveston Island earth , The Texas earth ! ( Now follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a crescendo of whistling , surging winds , lightnings and rolling reverberating thunder crashings and bellowings . The multitudinous pattering of drenching rainfloodings is heard . On the berm that runs across the center stage at the rear the writhing tops of bushes and trees stand beaten by the wind . After a moment this finds a calm expression in the music . As the light fades out , the VOICE speaks again. ) p. 3 GAIL BORDEN What are the powers of nature ? Man fears them not  --  he outlasts them , Claiming the land his own , Announcing his certain ownership , Here on this island , here where we watch tonight  --  He , the mighty Chief of the Karankawa Indians ! ( The music passes into an Indian drum dance accompaniment , and the light comes up in a tight circle on the center stage , revealing the Chief in all his outlandish make-up and dress , with two of his attendants carrying torches . He dances his thanks unto his god for making him the lord of the surrounding land  --  he the mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sea and protection from his enemies . This is his land forever  --  north , south , east , west , as he pantomimically illustrates .

Declaring this his land  --  Land for the chosen people ! Others to do our willing , As we shall signify  --  on this our land ! ( The music changes into a Gregorian rendition . ) GAIL BORDEN ( Begins the chant. ) p. 4 Dominus sit in corde meo et in labiis meis  --  ut digne et competenter annuntiem Evangelium suum . Amen . ( The light pours in on the center stage and berm . Entering from the rear comes a Catholic priest holding a cross aloft , followed by a Spanish flagbearer and the Spanish leader with a bodyguard . Now follows the ritual of prayer and then the reaffirming that the island belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by movement of the cross and the flag . The VOICE speaks in accompaniment to the action on the stage . ) GAIL BORDEN We do declare the sovereignty of Spain over this land  --  this the Year of Our Lord , fifteen hundred and twenty-eight . ( A trumpet blows , the light dims and the VOICE speaks again as the background music continues . ) GAIL BORDEN The sword and the cross , both as one , Mark Spanish power over this island And the seas around it , And Spanish Viceroy of Mexico Declaring it . ( The light comes in on the rear center stage in a bright spread . The young Viceroy , Count Bernardo de Galvez , in brilliant uniform , appears there on a horse , accompanied by his equerry , likewise on a horse and holding a Spanish flag aloft . Galvez lifts a document up before him . ) GAIL BORDEN ( Reads. ) p. 5 I , Bernardo de Galvez , Viceroy of Spain , By virtue of the authority vested in me By his gracious majesty , Charles , King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name That the said island and The city to be builded there Shall be named for him  --  and in mine honor  --  Galvez  --  ton . ( A trumpet fanfare sounds . The scene fades out .

And the winds blow , The waters heave and lie still , Lie still and heave again . The bird broods upon the waters , The land waits  --  Galvez-ton land  --  ( The music makes a short phrase of comment . ) And the brash Frenchman comes  --  The rapacious one , the bold and unafraid , He takes over  --  In his new fort  --  Maison Rouge  --  Here on Galveston Island  --  Pirate , trader , dealer in slaves , ( announcingly ) Jean Lafitte !

Going at two-fifty  --  Two-fifty once  --  two-fifty twice  --  ( LAFITTE gestures , shakes his head , saying no , and springs out of his chair . The VOICE speaks for him . ) Five dollars a pound !  --  un bon marche ! I will keep her  --  Keep  --  her  --  elle est moi  --  mine ! ( He holds out his arms and she flies into them . He holds her close and calls out through the VOICE . ) Tonight we celebrate the birthday of our town  --  Campeachy on Galveston Island  --  We are a thousand strong on this island  --  A thousand strong  --  Here to abide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dances away with the girl . The guitar and violin music dies , and the scene blacks out . A musical comment sounds . The VOICE resumes . ) GAIL BORDEN But the pirate Lafitte and his power pass away  --  And once more the land waits  --  Galveston , the gateway to Texas , The gateway to the future  --  waiting . Where are the men , where are the women , The strong ones coming on  --  To measure their strength Against the strong land ? Where ? ( Joyously . ) Listen , look  --  see  --  They come , they come ! ( A trumpet blares in the sound track , and the light comes up on the berm at the rear . Entering along the berm roadway at the right rear comes a procession of immigrants on their way to Texas . First is a covered wagon drawn by two mules , a man and his family of five or six riding in it , he driving . A milk cow tied by a rope follows behind . A sign on the side of the wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A few people are walking also , carrying bundles , bedrolls , a box or two , followed by a man leading a loaded pack mule , then another man with a spinning wheel hooked over his shoulders , and so on . The dress of these immigrants is of the 1830 's . They are stepping lively along , their faces raised in expectancy as they look straight ahead of them . The music in the sound track is a marching beat of the old hymn " Bound for the Promised Land . " They move on and just as they are disappearing at the left rear on the roadway , the sound of a steamboat whistle is heard at the right offscene . A few of the marchers stop and look back . The bow of a steamboat pushes in at the right center . Smoke is pouring from its one smokestack . The light comes on there in a full spread . On the side of the boat 's bow is the big word " LIBERTY . " A number of immigrant people are aboard , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which they come  --  Virginia , Carolina , Alabama , Kentucky and Georgia . The music changes into the Texas melody " The Wide Free Land , " and the people disembark with their bundles and belongings . The steamboat gives a few merry tootings as this is happening , and the flags are waved . Now more of those on the berm turn back to greet the newcomers . During the pantomime of greetings they all break into the Texas song , the music and recorded voices in the sound track adding their help. ) p. 8 PEOPLE From the fields and the hills &nbsp; &nbsp; And the valleys we come , And thousands more are on their way &nbsp; &nbsp; To find a happy home  --  To build a home here in the West &nbsp; &nbsp; And boldly take our stand'Way out in Texas &nbsp; &nbsp; In the wide free land . ( All the people have now turned and are moving up toward the berm at the left rear , singing as they go , the music and voices in the sound track joining in as before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new life waits ahead.Bold hearts will go where they will go &nbsp; &nbsp; As long as blood runs red.Go where you will , the future calls , &nbsp; &nbsp; A life that 's fresh and free , It 's Texas , fair Texas , &nbsp; &nbsp; The land that waits for me . ( The light follows the departing people to the left rear , and in the darkness at the right center the steamboat moves back and out . The music goes down and under for an instant . The VOICE comes in again as before . ) GAIL BORDEN By ship they cameAnd overland they came , Riding , walking  --  their feet , their faces , Their hearts toward Texas . ( The people 's voices and the interpretative VOICE now come in as one in the sound track in a cheering shout. ) p. 9 Texas ! Tex  --  as ! ( The music pours in with a final fortissimo chord as the light fades out at the left rear . After a few heartbeats of silence , a spotlight comes on at the right front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a man in his early thirties , tall , big-boned and sinewy , and of frank and open countenance . His voice is fresh and clear and his manner engaging and energetic . He is simply dressed in the style of the times . ) GAIL BORDEN Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . Welcome to our " Lone Star " drama . My name is Gail Borden . ( With a chuckle . ) Perhaps some of you recognize the name . ( He pulls a notebook from his pocket . ) Wherever I go I make notes about people and happenings for my newspaper " The Telegraph and Texas Register . " ( He bows and moves a step nearer the audience , speaking briskly and informingly . ) As most of you know , Texas was once a part of Mexico and as such remained for generations pretty much empty of human inhabitants save for a few scattered Indian tribes . In 1819 Mexico finally gained her independence from Spain and established a liberal constitution modeled after the American one . She then offered generous grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response from a great number of United States people was enthusiastic . One of the first and most successful pioneers in the settling was Stephen F. Austin , later known as the father of Texas and for whom our state capital is named . I was one of those pioneers , too I and my wife Penelope for we came here to Stephen Austin 's settlement of San Felipe in 1829  --  nine years before the Republic of Texas won her independence . First we raised some stock . Then I began some surveying  --  and surveyed most of the land on this Galveston Island . Yes , I was one of those who strongly favored declaring independence from Mexico , and during the war which followed that declaration , I reported on it in my newspaper . So I 'll be your narrator for this drama of Texas ' fight for independence  --  sort of reporting on the events as they are played for you on this stage , as it were . Let us go back in our imagination for more than a century and a half . Conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play begins , but trouble is brewing , and the fur has to fly . Our story opens here ( He gestures toward center stage. ) p. 10 @x A follow spot picks up HOUSTON entering on a white horse up center on the berm . ANDY MERRITT , 26 and ESAU , Houston 's Negro servant , about 30 , follow on horseback too . They dismount , and ESAU leads the horses offstage . The light widens , taking in the full scene in and around Austin 's log house . It is a two-room structure with a chimney at one end and a center overhanging section of porch roof . Some twenty or thirty people are in the yard , more men than women , including FATHER MIGUEL MULDOON , an easy-going , middle-aged Catholic priest ; LAURA HAYES , an attractive widow of 30 ; BARBARA FLORES , a pretty Mexican girl of 20 , wearing an hibiscus flower in her hair ; RUBEN VICENTE , a young Mexican youth of 24 ; REBECCA CUMMINGS , a high-spirited girl of 22 ; STEPHEN AUSTIN , 41 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in her mid-forties , BUCK TRAVIS , 25 ; MURPH ENNIS ; and MRS . LUDIE JONES . HOUSTON waves his big white hat joyfully and moves down into the scene on center stage . His tall form and fine dress dominate the scene . He is well over six feet tall , of good proportion , quick and decisive in his action and with a face marked with firmness and decisiveness  --  a man of force and native leadership . The people , led by MURPH ENNIS and accompanied by a little group of gathered musicians with their instruments  --  guitar , violin , banjo , flute , drum and double bass  --  burst into a welcoming song . PEOPLE We welcome Samuel Houston , &nbsp; &nbsp; Well-known to song and fame , And north and south the people &nbsp; &nbsp; Pay honor to his name.It 's now he 's come to Texas &nbsp; &nbsp; To answer freedom 's call  --  Hooray for Samuel Houston . &nbsp; &nbsp; Hooray for one and all . p. 12 SAM HOUSTON ( In response  --  recitative if necessary . ) The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waits ahead , It matters not , the hardships  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; We face them unafraid . ALL Then sing the song of freedom , &nbsp; &nbsp; As we march on our way  --  Hooray for Texas  --  Texas ! &nbsp; &nbsp; Hooray , hooray , hooray ! ( The music ends to applause , and the people gather in warmer welcome around Houston , shaking his hand and so on . The musicians strike up a lively dance tune , and the settlers , including the newly-arrived SAMUEL HOUSTON and ANDY MERRITT , celebrate with a festive country dance , ending with applause . AUSTIN holds up his hand and moves to center on the left side stage . The people applaud him . He is obviously popular with them all . He is a man of medium height , slender and of somewhat gentle voice and manner . But those who know him well  --  and most of those present do  --  know that for all his quietness and kindly smile he is a man of patient persistence and tenacious will . The people grow quiet . MARY AUSTIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEPHEN F. AUSTIN Mis amigos  --  friends  --  now and then in times past you have brought music and cheer to my humble dwelling . Always my thanks to you . p. 13 MARY AUSTIN HOLLEY We all love you , Stephen Austin . GIRLS Yes , yes . STEPHEN F. AUSTIN ( Smiles and bows , then turns to the musicians . ) And we are thankful for the good music . My old bones have got loosened up . How about it , Cousin Mary Holley ? MARY AUSTIN HOLLEY If dancing could build Texas , we 'd already be free of Mexico , Cousin Stephen . VOICES Right ! Right ! Free  --  free ! MURPH ENNIS ( Elderly and lean , with a huge voice . ) It ai n't music that loosens bones , Mr. Austin . It 's this good old Texas air . Back east , they told me old folks coming to Texas turned young again . I 'm sixty year old and I 've been here only two weeks , and already I feel like a young man of forty  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Yeh , man ! MURPH ENNIS Widow Ludie Jones here is beginning to look better and better to me ! ( He lets loose his splattering laugh as he pinches her . The people laugh again . ) STEPHEN F.

Will you make me a pair of shoes before the cold weather sets in , old man ? MURPH ENNIS When you ask me in them purty words like that , Mrs. Jones , I say , yes ma'am ! ( He lets loose his whickering laugh again . ) STEPHEN F. AUSTIN Good people , today this great American , Governor Sam Houston , has arrived in San Felipe ! ( The people cheer as HOUSTON again moves through the crowd shaking hands and crosses up onto the side stage with AUSTIN . ) He needs no introduction . You 've heard about him , read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . MURPH ENNIS I voted for you reg'lar , back in Tennessee , Governor Houston .

AUSTIN We would appreciate a word from you , sir , for the days ahead . ALL Yes , yes , speech , speech ! ( Applause . HOUSTON steps down center on the side stage . He looks out at the people as they move in closer to him . ESAU , SADIE WADE , her mother ZELLA and younger brother AMOS and sister MISSY in the background listen attentively. ) p. 15 SAM HOUSTON Friends , you honor me , and I am honored also to stand here with your courageous leader Stephen Austin .

That 's why I 've come to Texas  --  for the days ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life  --  anyway , a more productive one . Right off the Mexican land office has promised me a grant of land down on Galveston Island . ( AUSTIN nods . ) I 'm mainly a lawyer , and I hope there 's legal work to be had here . STEPHEN F. AUSTIN Yes sir , in plenty  --  titles , land deeds , notes of hand . Mr. Travis can tell you . BUCK TRAVIS ( stepping forward ) They 're piling up as people pour in from the United States . SAM HOUSTON Good , good . I 'm going to make a little pocket change , too , I hope , representing the Galveston Bay and Texas Land Company . LORENZO DE ZAVALA ( speaking out ) Senor Borden and his men have already surveyed about a hundred lots on that beautiful island , sir . SAM HOUSTON There 'll be a city and a great seaport there some day , I believe . LORENZO DE ZAVALA Si . No doubt of it . If all goes well with Senor Austin . p. 16 STEPHEN F. AUSTIN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to HOUSTON ) You may have heard , sir , that the Mexican Congress is beginning to view us restless Texans with suspicion , and we Texans are more and more resenting their rules and regulations . BUCK TRAVIS ( always outspoken ) Right about that ! VOICES I say so , Buck Travis . Yes sir ! STEPHEN F. AUSTIN General Santa Anna has in times past been a liberal friend of Texas , and I believe  --  BUCK TRAVIS Has been  --  STEPHEN F. AUSTIN I believe that as the new president of Mexico he will stand as our protection against any tyrannical congress . From my letters and reports he is well-acquainted with our needs . ( to HOUSTON ) The Council here has decided I should go to Mexico City to meet with President Santa Anna and that , as Mexican citizens , we secure our rights and privileges under the liberal Mexican Constitution of 1824 . LORENZO DE ZAVALA Which in the past El Presidente Santa Anna has strongly supported . SAM HOUSTON ( heartily ) You are the one man to go , Stephen Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's the man . SAM HOUSTON And I would urge you to hurry in this matter  --  while there is still time  --  if there is time . MARY AUSTIN HOLLEY Our prayers will go with you , Cousin Stephen . STEPHEN F.

Yes ! SAM HOUSTON And Andy Merritt here  --  who has come to Texas with me  --  ( He indicates MERRITT who raises his hand. )  --  is a cotton man . ANDY MERRITT ( loudly as he steps forward ) The future of Texas is cotton . That 's what I believe  --  and it 'll happen if we all work for it . ( announcingly ) I 'll be around to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of men nod to this and hold up their hands . ) VOICES Good . You can count on me. p. 18 STEPHEN F. AUSTIN And as we work , we will grow strong . ( quickly ) And in strength we can be patient and peaceful while the future unfolds itself , Mr. Travis . ( He emphasizes the words " peaceful " and " patient . " ) BUCK TRAVIS I 'll try to be patient , but about being peaceful  --  I do n't know . STEPHEN F. AUSTIN Friends , our beloved storekeeper , Papa Flores , has an announcement . ( ZAVALA helps JUAN FLORES up the steps and onto the left side stage . He is a stocky , genial Mexican of about 50 . ) PAPA FLORES Listen piple , I have ' nouncement to make ! Next week pronto I have new boatload of goods for my store come up the Brazos  --  hats and shoes , pots and pans , axes and hoes , laces and ribbons for the ladies . So do n't forget me .

( The musicians and other people begin to move off toward the left . Some of the men twirl their partners about for an instant as they start off , MERRITT dances BARBARA back downstage . The light dims down and a follow spot picks up MERRITT and BARBARA. ) p. 19 ANDY MERRITT I 'm glad I met you  --  and could dance with you . Maybe I 'll see you again sometime , Miss Barbara Flores , or is it Senorita ? BARBARA FLORES ( with a touch of accent ) Whatever you wish . ( laughing ) You see me now . ANDY MERRITT Say , I 'm going to be around here a lot , I hope , and around Galveston Island . Great cotton country here , like I said .

ANDY MERRITT ( suddenly and shyly ) You 're mighty pretty , Barbara  --  and I 'm specially glad I 've come . ( Her pleasure and embarrassment are mixed . She nervously fingers the flower in her hair . VICENTE comes in and takes BARBARA 's arm . The two men look at each other . ) BARBARA FLORES This is my friend , Ruben Vicente . ( VICENTE leads her away as MERRITT turns from , them . ) ANDY MERRITT Friend ? ( The hibiscus flower BARBARA fingered drops to the ground . MERRITT steps forward , picks it up , smells it , and stands holding it in his hand . ) ( After a moment , from the darkness at the left center a woman 's voice is heard singing . The light comes up there , showing the back yard of the Austin home , a few days later . The log house has been turned to a different angle . SADIE WADE is at a washtub energetically scrubbing clothes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tied up in a piece of old cloth. ) p. 20 SADIE WADE I got a robe , you got a robe , &nbsp; &nbsp; All God 's chillun got a robe  --  When I get to heaben , going to put on my robe  --  I 'm gon na shout all over God 's heaben . &nbsp; &nbsp; Heaben , heaben  --  Gon na shout all over God 's heaben .

From behind the house her mother ZELLA calls out . ) ZELLA WADE ( offscene ) Come on , younguns ! ( She enters carrying a chopping hoe in her hand and wearing a workdress and a slat bonnet . She stops and looks back and calls again . ) You , Amos , Missy , come on ! ( AMOS and MISSY come in , each carrying a hoe .

Him and Mr. Merritt have been down on Galveston Island , making plans for cotton shipping .

SADIE picks up the discarded head rag , holds it disdainfully between forefinger and thumb , then flings it into the tub and washes it roughly . Her song rises again and the little scene fades out . Her melody segues into the sound of a banjo at the far left rear , and the light comes up there . SAM HOUSTON comes riding slowly along the berm roadway on his fine horse . His head is bowed in thought . As he is disappearing at the right , ESAU comes along following on a mule . He is plunking his banjo and singing. ) p. 23 ESAU Some of these days ' bout twelve o'clockThis old world gon na reel and rock  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; Pharoah 's army got drownded , &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh , Mary , do n't you weep .

( The little scene fades out as the music and song ends . After an instant , the light comes up on the right side stage revealing the President 's office in the White House . A large picture of Washington on the wall . JACKSON has just risen from his desk to welcome HOUSTON . He wears steel-rimmed spectacles , is rather tall and sinewy , and his great shaggy head is somewhat bent . His face below his unruly gray hair is seamed and craggy , and his once-bright piercing blue eyes are dimmed with care and age . He is 65 years old .

I 'm beginning to smell the mold and I ca n't sleep . And worst of all , Sam , I 'm a slave . SAM HOUSTON ( indulgently ) A slave ? ANDREW JACKSON To Congress  --  to men like Dan'l Webster  --  with his anti-slavery tirade ! He wears me out . Since the day I came through that door as President of these United States , I 've had no peace . SAM HOUSTON ( smiling ) And I remember how hard all of us worked , including you , sir , so you could walk through that door . ANDREW JACKSON ( Sinking down in his chair and gesturing HOUSTON to a seat . ) By soul , Sam , there 's nobody I 'd rather see than you . SAM HOUSTON I need your advice , Mr. President .

( He spits in pantomime toward an unseen spittoon . ) SAM HOUSTON Mr. President , there are nearly thirty thousand settlers from the United States in Texas now . Legally they are citizens of Mexico , but in their hearts they 're still Americans  --  Texans. p. 25 ANDREW JACKSON You know as well as I do , Sam , that for years we have tried to buy Texas from Mexico . And the Mexicans have resented it . The United States Congress has finally ruled . The subject is closed . Dan'l Webster sees to that . We have a treaty with Mexico now , and Santa Anna , their new president , confirms it . SAM HOUSTON From what I would surmise he is a dictatorial one . ANDREW JACKSON The United States has to do business with the heads of government whether we like their politics or not . SAM HOUSTON But if trouble broke out between Mexico and Texas ?  --  It 's my opinion that ninety percent of the Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . ANDREW JACKSON They once did belong .

( JACKSON nods . ) A chance to say farewell to an old way of life and make a new start . ( He takes a step toward JACKSON . ) Texas . It offers a way out , up  --  a new life maybe for me ! As I help build it , I rebuild myself  --  me in Texas and Texas in me. p. 26 ANDREW JACKSON ( Reaches out and clasps one of HOUSTON 's great hands in his . ) I understand , Sam . ( He releases HOUSTON 's hand . ) SAM HOUSTON Trouble is about to break out down there , sir . ANDREW JACKSON ( strongly ) Our sources in Mexico City keep me informed . SAM HOUSTON I had hoped to find your views maybe changed about Texas . ANDREW JACKSON ( strongly ) No sir ! Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City with a petition , and Santa Anna has had him arrested and put in prison . SAM HOUSTON That dictator  --  as blind as he is evil ! Now more Texans will turn against Mexico . Austin is much beloved ! ANDREW JACKSON Santa Anna is Mexico now . Call him what you will , but he has the power . SAM HOUSTON ( staring off ) If I know Austin , he will somehow get out of that prison . Power , power  --  well , we shall see . ANDREW JACKSON ( Suddenly rises and points a bony finger at HOUSTON . ) A warning , Sam . If the Texans  --  you Texans  --  are foolish enough  --  and I mean the word  --  to stir up trouble and finally take up arms , you 'll have a sad and bloody awakening . This Santa Anna will march in with his armies and crush the rebellion  --  and I mean crush . I have studied the man . He is a military genius . p. 27 SAM HOUSTON And if , like the colonists who rebelled against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a just cause  --  and it would be just  --  then what ? Would you  --  would the United States  --  stand idly by and allow  --  ANDREW JACKSON We have a treaty of friendship with Mexico , I tell you . So does England ! SAM HOUSTON ( loudly ) England ! A treaty with Mexico ? ANDREW JACKSON A treaty of mutual assistance  --  recently signed . If we broke it , we 'd not only have Mexico to fight but probably Great Britain also . ( strongly ) By saints , man , my answer to you has to be no . So go back to Texas , help build up the country as only you can , and find peace in your soul . But do n't start a war . Texas would have to fight alone , and that would be her ruin . Patience , man , patience , and time will direct us . ( He gives HOUSTON a sharp look and takes his hand again . ) You understand me , Sam ? SAM HOUSTON Thank you , Mr. President , I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Stephen Austin there in his Mexican prison . ( A handshake and he goes . ) ( A CLERK appears . ) CLERK Mr. Webster is waiting , sir . p. 28 ANDREW JACKSON Get me a glass of whiskey and show him in . Hurry  --  ( fiercely )  --  not with Webster  --  hurry with the whiskey ! ( The CLERK goes . JACKSON moves to his desk and papers and sinks down . The scene fades out . A military bugle blows a salute offscene . It is repeated farther away . The light comes up on the left side stage , disclosing a room in the President 's palace in Mexico City  --  a sort of combination office and sitting room  --  a rather sumptuous place . Outside in front of the palace , right and left , stand two effigy-like guards , motionless and staring and armed with big rifles at parade rest . The Mexican flag flies from a pole leaning diagonally out from the palace wall . At the rear of the room , beyond a large swung-back window , is a balcony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unseen people in the street or square below . ) VOICES ( offscene ) El Presidente ! El Presidente ! Viva ! Viva ! Viva ! Santa Anna ! Santa Anna ! ( STEPHEN AUSTIN is standing in the room . SANTA ANNA turns back to go on with the interrupted meeting with AUSTIN . He is a dark-featured man , solidly but gracefully built and somewhat younger than AUSTIN . His manner is sincere and ingratiating , and he smiles easily . A number of military medals adorn his breast. ) p. 29 ANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA ANNA ( with something of an accent ) Perdone usted , senor , for this interruption , but when the people call I must show myself to them . Now back to our subject . Senor Austin , again I ask you  --  do I not prove my trust in you by releasing you from your confinement ? STEPHEN F. AUSTIN ( with a slight bow ) Muchas gracias , Excelencia ! ANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA ANNA I free you for a reason  --  and that reason is peace in Texas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of my ability . ANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA ANNA ( Chuckles . ) Senor Empresario , Mexico has given freely to the Americans millions of acres of her rich land  --  given , you hear . And you , Senor Stephen Austin , have done most fairly with us . But when you ask that Texas set up a separated state , then  --  STEPHEN F. AUSTIN  --  But still to be a part of Mexico like Coahuila , Your Excellency . I have never recommended rebellion . Mine was a tentative proposal to the Mexican Congress . ANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA ANNA So I make you free  --  libre  --  send you back to your colony pronto to use your great influence , your good and excellent voice to persuade them from  --  er  --  their restlessness , their secret and rebellious meetings . ( smiling ) Ah , my dear sir  --  mi estimado amigo  --  and you have been that  --  my friend  --  ( He suddenly claps AUSTIN somewhat affectionately on the shoulder. )  --  All these years we have worked in  --  er  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty and your effort . I know that rebellion is talked in Velasco , in Bolivar , in Gonzales . Your own San Felipe colony has become a place of treasonable talk , plots , plannings . And now the evil one , this Don Samuel Houston has come to live in Texas . p. 30 STEPHEN F. AUSTIN Governor Houston is ever advising obedience to the law . ANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA ANNA Hear me , senor . The Texans will repent in ashes and blood if they oppose me . ( Now the smile is gone . He pulls a paper from his pocket . ) This is the law passed by the Mexican Congress in last session assembled with no vote against it  --  unnimo  --  as you say , unanimous . ( He hands the paper to AUSTIN . ) Read it , senor . We hear it together . STEPHEN F. AUSTIN ( Reads . ) " Any person who takes up arms against the lawful government of Mexico and is captured shall be hanged or shot as a traitor and pirate . Death by shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly ) Death ! I am sworn to carry out the law . My oath is registered in heaven ! ( He crosses himself and looks upward . ) And there are other orders and restrictions there . STEPHEN F. AUSTIN I understand , Your Excellency . ( He offers the paper back . ) ANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA ANNA No , the paper is yours . And so are these  --  hundreds more . ( He hands him a packet . ) Put them on all the public boards  --  let every man , woman and child in Texas know the will of my government , know my will . Go back to the people there  --  pronto  --  order them to remain peaceful , loyal Mexican citizens as they are sworn to do . Then no harm shall come to them . As supreme head of the Mexican government I give the honest word . ( Now a cold light is in his eyes . ) But if they lift a hand in rebellion  --  I repeat  --  if in spite of your efforts and my commands , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas from the motherland of Mexico , I shall with fire and sword lay waste the land from the Rio Grande to the Sabine River on the east , and the crows and vultures will feast to vomiting on the eyes and brains of the Texas dead . ( bowing ) I have sworn to carry out the law . Our cause is just . Long live Mexico ! ( He salutes the air. ) p. 31 STEPHEN F. AUSTIN I receive your words , sir . These will be posted , throughout the districts . ( He indicates the packet . SANTA ANNA holds out his hand . A slight hesitation shows on AUSTIN 's part , but he takes it . ) ANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA ANNA ( almost pleadingly ) Muy bien ! Persuade your people , Senor Austin , persuade them ! ( They move toward the door . ) And please , my respects to Senor Houston . I hope to meet him someday . STEPHEN F. AUSTIN I trust you may , sir . ANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA ANNA Es todo ! Buen viaje ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He moves away carrying the saddlebag . ) ( Immediately the sound of guitars , flutes and tambourines is heard and offscene voices again crying " El Presidente ! El Presidente ! " SANTA ANNA , with his hands clasped high above him comes down , meeting the people entering from the left center , the musicians playing away as they come . Several of the people carry Mexican flags held aloft . They surround SANTA ANNA in a fiesta dance which lasts about two minutes . As the music stops , SANTA ANNA calls out . ) ANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA ANNA Ahora , vamos al banquete ! p. 32 VOICES Banquete ! Banquet ! Vino ! Vino ! Wine ! ( He takes a flag from one of the bearers and leads the way off to the banquet hall at the left rear . The scene slowly fades out , and the light comes on in a tight spot downstage center , revealing Gail Borden , the Narrator . ) GAIL BORDEN And so Stephen Austin , freed at last , started his long journey home , bearing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government to his beloved people . Texans must knuckle under or fight . Meanwhile at San Felipe , Galveston and elsewhere it was carry out the work  --  continue to build , build ! Texas a-growing ! And there were other matters at work  --  of the heart as well as of the hand . ( He gestures to the right and retires as the light fades . From the darkness at the right center the strumming of a guitar is heard . The light comes up there . BARBARA FLORES is seated on a garden bench in front of the little Flores house with her guitar . Only the wall and front door of the dwelling are discerned in the shadows . ANDY MERRITT is standing near her with his hat in his hand , entranced as she sings to her own accompaniment . ) BARBARA FLORES ( singing ) Paloma Blanca , Quien tuviera tus alas ? Para volarDonde estan mis amoresToma y llvelaEste ramo de floresPara que de acuerde de este pobre corazon . ( Her voice dies out and her fingers play idly with the guitar strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing beautifully , Barbara . BARBARA FLORES I love the old Mexican songs . You Americans  --  Texans  --  do n't have beautiful music like us . ANDY MERRITT Oh , yes , we do , young lady . It 's different from yours , but it 's beautiful . ( The word " beautiful " echoes in his mind . ) And you 're beautiful , Barbara , you are . I think about you a lot  --  all the time I 've been down on Galveston Island helping Mr. Borden survey Governor Houston 's land and others ' , I kept thinking of you . Everybody says trouble 's coming . Old Santa Anna , blind as a bat , is trying to make slaves out of us and  --  BARBARA FLORES Stop it ! ANDY MERRITT ( incredulously ) What in the world ! Oh , there I go again  --  running off at the mouth . BARBARA FLORES He is our presidente  --  your presidente . We have no right to criticize , to insult  --  Good night ! ( She starts to go . ) ANDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barbara , do n't ( He pulls a flower from his pocket . ) Guess what this is ? BARBARA FLORES ( She shakes her head , curiosity in her . ) A dried flower  --  pressed . A hibiscus blossom . p. 34 ANDY MERRITT Yes , the one you accidentally dropped the day I met you and we danced together . I 've saved it ever since . ( He touches it to his lips . ) BARBARA FLORES You 're sweet , Andy Merritt . ANDY MERRITT If our people turn against each other , let 's not you and me . I love you , Barbara . ( He reaches for her hand . She moves quickly off . He stands forlorn . She stops in the open doorway to the Flores house and calls . ) BARBARA FLORES No accident I dropped that flower , Andy Merritt . I meant to drop it  --  for you . ( She goes in , the door quickly closing behind her . He gazes happily after her . ) ANDY MERRITT Hot dog ! ( He dashes gleefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the left center . The light shifts there , revealing the small porch of LAURA HAYES ' cabin , the light coming through the open door from the room beyond helping to illuminate it . LAURA HAYES , HOUSTON and FATHER MULDOON have come out on the porch , HOUSTON carrying his big hat in his hand . ) FATHER MIGUEL MULDOON Thank you , Mrs. Hayes , for your hospitality and a most excellent dinner . LAURA HAYES Food simple enough , Father . You honor me. p. 35 FATHER MIGUEL MULDOON ( to HOUSTON ) In these troubled times , Governor Houston , I trust divine power will guide us . SAM HOUSTON I trust so , Father , and we all must do our part too . FATHER MIGUEL MULDOON As St. Thomas Aquinas said  --  " God steers the ship , but misguided men too often try to take over the helm . " It is good news that Stephen Austin will be home again in a few days . SAM HOUSTON The whole colony will be heartened by his return . He has been sorely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly on you two men  --  on you most of all , Governor Houston . ( He puts out his hand . ) Good night , sir . ( He shakes hands , turns to LAURA and bends over hers . ) Good night , sister . Peace be with you . LAURA HAYES Peace be with you , Father . ( He goes . They watch him move on into the darkness . ) A good man . SAM HOUSTON The best . LAURA HAYES His care for the sick never weakens . During my husband 's illness he was here with us to the end . Night after night Father Muldoon sat with him through the long hours . p. 36 SAM HOUSTON Yes . ( He stares down at LAURA and then off . ) I fear the Cardinal will recall him to Mexico City when trouble breaks . LAURA HAYES When ? We are still at peace . SAM HOUSTON ( gesturing ) So is the little Brazos River here  --  running slowly and peacefully tonight . It too knows storms and floods . ( He moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand looking down at the stream . ) LAURA HAYES I love this Brazos River . There 's a song about it . You know it ? SAM HOUSTON I guess I 'm too new for that . LAURA HAYES ( Begins singing it in almost child-like clearness . ) The fair Guadalupe runs twisting and winding.The crooked Colorado runs narrow and winding.The old Trinity it crosses the plainBut it 's back to the Brazos my heart turns again . Then la - la - la - lee - la- &nbsp; &nbsp; Reach me your hand  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; It 's out in old Texas &nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm making my stand . Then there are some more verses about a girl  --  and  --  and so on  --  SAM HOUSTON Do n't stop  --  please . p. 37 LAURA HAYES ( suddenly ) Look , there 's a star shining in the water  --  single and alone . And now it 's winking , winking and is gone . SAM HOUSTON A fish coming up thinking it was a yellow moth bait perhaps . Symbolic - a poem could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write it , Governor Houston ? SAM HOUSTON Me ? I ca n't write poetry . LAURA HAYES You can . ( He stares down at her . She quotes . ) There is a proud undying thought in man That bids his soul still upward look To fame 's proud cliff ! And longing Look in hope to grace his name For after ages to admire and wonder at . SAM HOUSTON My Lord , where did you get that ? LAURA HAYES You read it to us in school the morning after you had written it . You put part of it on the blackboard . I copied it down . I kept it . I learned it by heart . SAM HOUSTON ( almost stuttering ) You  --  you  --  are  --  LAURA HAYES Laura Maxton I was . I went to school to you . SAM HOUSTON ( almost with a shout ) Of course ! Now I remember  --  I see it  --  see your curly head  --  and your smiling eyes  --  and they still smile . ( He drops his hat and grabs both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl in school ! Yes , you could cut the big boys down in the spelling match . Why have n't you told me ? p. 38 LAURA HAYES Maybe to keep it till now . SAM HOUSTON I was nineteen and full of ambition to study law . I was a terrible teacher . LAURA HAYES You were a good teacher . SAM HOUSTON Your face was as freckled as a guinea egg . LAURA HAYES I was so ashamed . ( He is suddenly conscious that he still holds her hands . She is too . He shakes his head and drops them . ) SAM HOUSTON Ah , I felt like I could conquer the world then . Time teaches us . I had completely forgotten that poem  --  and all others I used to write . ( grinding his big hands together ) Sometimes I have a feeling of hope . Maybe there is still time , time to reach that height  --  to prove worthy  --  then I  --  ( He flings out his hands . ) LAURA HAYES ( sharply as she gestures at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even , to reach the sea . You are a river , Samuel Houston , a great river , and you will pour your greatness into the waiting sea  --  the world  --  to help fill it . ( She suddenly lifts his hand and kisses it , then turns quickly and is gone to the house and in . He stares after her , then after a moment picks up his hat and turns into the darkness at the left rear . ) ( The little scenelet fades out . Immediately the high and happy yell of MURPH ENNIS is heard at the extreme right front . The light comes up there , MURPH is wavering along the grassy incline and moving toward the right stage front , helped along by LUDIE JONES . He is all liquored up. ) p. 39 MURPH ENNIS Hooray for Stephen Austin , hooray ! LUDIE JONES Shut your big mouth . You 're a disgrace to Texas . MURPH ENNIS ( belching ) Stephen Austin 's coming home and I 'm celebrating . LUDIE JONES But he ai n't here yet . MURPH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ca n't honor him too much  --  before or after  --  for what he 's done for Texas ! ( giving another war whoop ) Hi-yee ! LUDIE JONES ( scouring out her ear with a forefinger ) You deefen me  --  you  --  ( pleadingly ) You promised to stay away from Peyton 's Tavern there  --  if you love me . ( She gestures off . ) MURPH ENNIS I love you all right , but I love Stephen Austin too - and him suffering so in that cold Mexican jail . ( He lunges forward and holds on to her . ) Oohm , you 're soft and sweet . ( He gives his neighing laugh . ) LUDIE JONES Keep your hands where they belong , Murph Ennis . ( She gives a half-restrained little giggle. ) p. 40 MURPH ENNIS That 's what I 'm trying to do , Ludie Jones . ( He belches once more and pulls at her dress . ) Do your purty new shoes fit ? LUDIE JONES ( pulling back her dress to show them ) They do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor of Stephen Austin too . MURPH ENNIS Bless your warm heart ! And what they cover is purty too  --  your sweet little feet  --  now they 've had some soap and water on'em . I put all my art of shoemaking into that pair of two shoes . Every peg and every stitch of waxed thread was an item of love from me to you . Amen ! LUDIE JONES Lordy mercy , and I 've got nothing to pay you with right now . You 'll have to change it . MURPH ENNIS Uhm , uhm , and so I will , sweet Ludie ! You can pay on the ' stalment plan the way folks do down at Papa Flores ' store . A ' stalment is due right now . ( He brushes back his moustache with the back of his hand , closes his eyes and gets set . She gives him a good payment . He hugs her tightly and his feet begin to cut up . ) Jesus , my Savior , I do love you ! LUDIE JONES There 's some good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go too far before we 're joined in lawful wedlock .

( They move on as best they can , MURPH trips over an obstacle , a root or stump , and falls sprawling . He slobbers , grunts , growls and with LUDIE 's help gets going again . ) LUDIE JONES ( She mocks him . ) Uh  --  uh - uh ! ( The little scene fades out . Presently the sound of angry voices is heard from the center stage . The light comes up there , showing the main street in San Felipe . In the center is a rough building with a big sign on it which says " San Felipe Land Office . " A Mexican flag flies from it . A short distance away is Juan Flores ' store , big letters saying " Juan Flores  --  Hardware and Merchandise .

" BUCK TRAVIS So they would shoot us or hang us if we take up arms against ' em  --  huh ! Well , we can shoot and hang too if we have to . p. 42 OTHER VOICES ( led by TRAVIS ) Right ! Down with Santa Anna ! Down with the dictator ! ( AUSTIN is standing on a mounting block in front of the Land Office . He holds Santa Anna 's order from which he has just read . Several of the people have come in from the fields and carry cotton sacks . ) STEPHEN F. AUSTIN ( loudly ) Listen , good people , friends , neighbors !

And a rope to hang hisself ! ( FATHER MULDOON and MERRITT try to quiet the turmoil . ) FATHER MIGUEL MULDOON ( loudly , firmly ) Friends , brothers , listen . ( The noise quiets down somewhat in respect to the Father . ) We must remember that Mexico has given us bounteous lands , freely given . p. 43 BUCK TRAVIS Not so free after all .

SAM HOUSTON ( strongly ) I agree with Stephen Austin . ( Growls and mutterings rise again . ) We must face the facts . Santa Anna has abolished the Mexican liberal constitution of 1824 which guaranteed our rights of life , liberty and property . He sends us new directives and orders  --  new custom duties imposed , denial of further land grants to new settlers , Mexican patrol guards in several districts , a curfew law , a loyalty oath  --  all cruel and tyrannical decrees . VOICES ( shouting ) Yes , by heaven and we wo n't obey them . No ! No ! SAM HOUSTON ( He raises his hand . The people grow quiet once more . ) Let Santa Anna know our obedience- ( He waits. )  --  for  --  a while . In the meantime- ( He gestures significantly . ) A VOICE Advise us , Sam Houston !

ANDY MERRITT Laura Hayes is smart , pretty too . SAM HOUSTON She went to school to me as a girl . ANDY MERRITT I know . She told me so .

Her mind is still on that Ruben Vicente . The scoundrel 's gone off and joined the Mexican patrol at Anahuac . SAM HOUSTON ( half-jokingly ) Then maybe you 'll have a chance to shoot at him in battle  --  when the war comes . ( The sound of galloping horses is heard in the distance , then two or three pistol shots . People come running back into the scene from all directions . JAMES BOWIE and DAVY CROCKETT gallop along the berm at the left rear . They dismount and come down into the excited scene . The horses are taken off . BOWIE is big and blond and about forty .

A medley of greetings follows , mutual naming , shaking of hands , etc . ) DAVY CROCKETT It 's notorious that wherever Sam Houston is there 's likely to be some action . So me and Jim Bowie have come to share in it . SAM HOUSTON If you like hard work , Davy , there 's plenty of that waiting right here . DAVY CROCKETT Just so it ai n't farming . Now it good hunting is needed or some fighting , me and old Betsy  --  ( He slaps the barrel of his musket. )  --  we 'll be right in it . Jim Bowie here has some news for you from San Antonio .

We must arm ourselves ! Rouse the people ! DAVY CROCKETT ( yelling as he brandishes his pistol ) And give him plenty of this ! ( He fires his pistol off , then glowers about him. ) p. 51 JAMES BOWIE ( in his loud announcing voice ) His route will be by San Antonio . You , Buck Travis  --  I call on you . Davy Crockett here will stand with us . DAVY CROCKETT ( braggingly ) Even unto death ! JAMES BOWIE I have a hundred and fifty men already waiting at Robin 's Ferry . We 'll gather others and meet at the Alamo ! BUCK TRAVIS At the Alamo  --  hooray !

Hear me , Jim Bowie ? JAMES BOWIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alamo could prove a death trap if surrounded by the enemy . Blow it up , delaying Santa Anna as you fall back . BUCK TRAVIS We would n't plan to fall back , Governor Houston . Volunteers will flock to us ! DAVY CROCKETT ( waving his cap ) Texas will be free ! VOICES Free ! Free ! ( TRAVIS springs to the land office and hauls down the Mexican flag . FLORES instinctively starts forward to its defense , but is pushed roughly back by BOWIE and others . The scene fades down to dim and holds as the roll of a drum sounds . This softens down and the light fades and comes on at the right front revealing BORDEN. ) p. 52 GAIL BORDEN ( strongly ) The news of Santa Anna 's invasion ran through the various districts like a prairie fire . The San Felipe Council voted to send Stephen Austin to the United States to seek money and arms and recruits wherever they could be found  --  even to making another appeal to President Jackson himself . Austin at once set out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas delegates from the various districts was called . There on March the second , 1836 , in a cold , half-finished building , they faced a stern and perilous decision . ( He gestures to the left and goes in that direction . The low drum roll ends and the light dies out . ) ( From the left a gavel is heard . After an instant of darkness the light comes up on the left side stage area . The gavel stops . The scene is the interior of an unfinished frame building . A window at the back is covered by a bed sheet to keep out the bitter wind . GEORGE CHILDRESS , 34 , is standing holding a document in his hand . RICHARD ELLIS , 40 , President of the Convention , is seated nearby on one of the rough benches . He holds a gavel . At the center and front are HOUSTON : ZAVALA ; DAVID G. BURNET , 46 ; THOMAS J. RUSK , 39 ; and ROBERT POTTER , 42 . The figures of other delegates are dimly seen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELLIS raps the gavel. ) p. 53 RICHARD ELLIS Continue with the resolution , Mr. Childress . GEORGE CHILDRESS ( reading in a strong voice , intense and compelling ) When a government has ceased to protect the life , liberty and property of the people , and when that government has become a harsh dictatorship , it is the right of the people  --  nay , their duty  --  to abolish such a government and create another to secure their future welfare and happiness . ( The delegates applaud . ) VOICES Hear ! Hear ! Right , George Childress ! Right ! GEORGE CHILDRESS General Santa Anna and the Mexican Congress have overturned the former liberal constitution of this country . They offer us now the cruel choice of either abandoning our homes or submitting to an enslaving tyranny . Therefore , be it resolved  --  that Texas declare herself  --  ( with a shout )  --  now and forever free from Mexico ! DELEGATES ( as they leap to their feet ) Aye ! Aye ! We vote aye . ( With one voice they cry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Independence ! ( The scene freezes and fades down . The light emphasizes BORDEN a bit . ) GAIL BORDEN A constitution for Texas was then adopted  --  with the same property and human rights as those in the United States Constitution . ( The light comes up again on the left side stage in a little eyeblink exposure , revealing HOUSTON and others with him standing immobile . BORDEN continues . ) David G. Burnet was elected the first President ; Lorenzo de Zavala , Vice-President ; Thomas J. Rusk , Secretary of War ; Robert Potter , Secretary of the Navy ; and Samuel Houston , Major-General , Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces of the Texas Republic ! ( As each one is named , he bows and lifts his hand . Now as if rushing in from all sides in the sound track come the triumphant voices of the unseen people , with bugle calls and drum rolls sounding with them and the delegates joining in. ) p. 54 DELEGATES AND VOICES Texas ! Texas ! Hooray for the Lone Star Republic ! OTHER VOICES Hooray for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light widens and brightens on the scene of jubilation  --  handshakes and embraces . The sound of a galloping horse is heard offscene . The delegates grow quiet , listening . BORDEN goes on . ) GAIL BORDEN In the midst of the celebration comes the appeal of Colonel William B. Travis , trapped with Bowie , Crockett and his men in the Alamo . ( A messenger enters the scene and hands a letter to ELLIS . ) RICHARD ELLIS ( banging the gavel ) Attention , gentlemen ! Attention ! ( reading ) " To the people of Texas  --  " ( The voice of TRAVIS is heard from the right side stage . ) ELLIS AND TRAVIS ( reading in unison ) " We are besieged in the Alamo . " ( The scene of the Constitutional Convention freezes and the light  --  in a shift of time sequence  --  cross fades to the right side stage , revealing an inside corner in the Alamo . TRAVIS , seated on a box , has his letter in his hand and is reading from it . The light tightens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are visible . BOWIE , very ill , is lying on a rude cot at the left rear . Young MRS . DICKINSON is tending him , cooling his feverish brow now and then with a damp cloth . SALLY , a middle-aged Negro woman , is sitting on the ground rocking back and forth with Mrs. Dickinson 's little daughter Angelina in her arms . DAVY CROCKETT is sitting on a box with old Betsy in his hands . JOE WADE is squatting on the ground near TRAVIS , sharpening Travis ' sword in pantomime . At the back are two or three soldiers facing out , their rifles resting on the parapet . The Texas flag flies above them . A few recumbent figures are shown in the shadows at the rear , taking their rest. ) p. 55 BUCK TRAVIS ( continuing ) " We are besieged by a thousand or more Mexicans under Santa Anna . The enemy has demanded our surrender , otherwise we are to be put to the sword . I call on you in the name of liberty , of patriotism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid . I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible . Victory or death ! William B. Travis , Lieutenant-Colonel , Commanding . " ( The drum roll sounds . The scene dims down and the tight rises again on the preceding scene for an eyeblink exposure . A delegate rushes up from the rear . He is ANTONIO NAVARRO , 33 . ) ANTONIO NAVARRO ( shouting ) I move we adjourn and march at once to the aid of those brave men in the Alamo ! SAM HOUSTON ( also loudly ) How aid them , Mr. Navarro ? We have only three hundred men as a beginning army and no navy yet . ANTONIO NAVARRO We ca n't leave them there to die ! DAVID G. BURNET Let us bow in prayer , beseeching the Almighty 's protection over them . ( With the exception of HOUSTON , all bow their heads . He stares straight ahead of him . ) ( The light fades and returns to the Alamo . TRAVIS is now standing at the rear . JOE takes his sword to him. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to stay right on here ? JOE WADE Yessir , long as you stay , Colonel Travis . ( TRAVIS nods his appreciation . JOE goes to the wall and looks out ) JAMES BOWIE ( Calls half-feverishly . ) Why is everything so quiet ? DAVY CROCKETT Yeh , this Alamo 's getting danged spooky . Where are all the Mexicans ? See anything out there , Joe ? JOE WADE All quiet , Colonel Crockett . DAVY CROCKETT I 've seen fighting men in my time , Buck Travis , but none as stubborn  --  and as brave  --  as these here Mexicans . BUCK TRAVIS Yeh . You beat'em off . You cover the ground with their dead . Still the living ones keep coming . DAVY CROCKETT They believe in their cause like we believe in ours . Hmn , I do n't understand the silence out there . ( In the distance the Mexican bugle begins the " deguello . " ) DAVY CROCKETT Now I do  --  their bugle speaks . ( The sleeping men all spring to their feet and grab their guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene . The call continues in the distance. ) p. 57 JAMES BOWIE ( Tries to prop himself up on his cot . ) The deguello  --  " no quarter " call ! MRS . SUSANNAH DICKINSON ( mopping his face ) Colonel Bowie  --  lie back . Rest yourself . JAMES BOWIE Surrender or death  --  that 's what that bugle means , Mrs. Dickinson . BUCK TRAVIS The beheading song . ( The men look at Travis , and TRAVIS looks at the men . He speaks up suddenly . ) Many of you might escape in the darkness , men . You hear me ? You might escape and get back to your families . DAVY CROCKETT ( calling out loudly ) We will stay !  --  Fight ! fight ! BUCK TRAVIS ( Takes his sword and draws a mark across the ground . He steps across it and stands waiting . ) You shall choose . Stay with me or go . ( He indicates the line drawn near Bowie 's cot . Now some men step across the line , showing they will remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lifted and moved across the line . One man holds back . The others look at him . He looks at them , his face quivering with emotion . TRAVIS stares at him . ) Private Rose , do you stay or go ? PRIVATE ROSE ( gulping as he steps back from the line ) None of us ever dreamed we 'd be shut up here to die like rats in a trap . ( with something of a shout ) I 've had enough of death . Life is the most precious thing a man has  --  my life is all I have . Live , not die , my life says to me. ( lifting up his bundle of clothes ) In the darkness I might make it , you say . I intend to make it  --  to make it across there to live . I ask others to join me. p. 58 JAMES BOWIE Out , out , before I shoot you like the dog you are ( He tries to lift his pistol . ) PRIVATE ROSE ( wagging his head ) You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your loved ones ?

JAMES BOWIE ( screaming ) Leave here ! Leave ! ( ROSE turns and disappears over the wall . The men mutter and growl . ) BUCK TRAVIS We know what we are doing , we know . Fools , he calls us . He is the fool . He 'll have to live with his cowardice the rest of his life . The hours we delay Santa Anna we give Houston that much more time to build his army to defend Texas . Texas ! DAVY CROCKETT ( with a shout ) Texas ! p. 59 BUCK TRAVIS God give us strength to the last . VOICES God grant it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do likewise . The light tightens in on them . The scene begins to fade out . Now nearer at hand the deguello sounds . ) SOLDIER ( at the rear ) Look out ! They 're coming ! ( The bugle gives a scream , followed by a crash of drums and musket fire . TRAVIS , CROCKETT and the men lunge forward . A SOLDIER lifts the Texas flag and waves it defiantly . He is struck by a bullet and falls . The scene blacks out . The firing increases , then fades . After a moment , far off we hear voices crying , " Independence ! Independence ! Texas is free ! " The light comes up on the street in San Felipe , same as before . The people of the settlement have gathered and are gathering in celebration , waving their different state flags as we had seen in the prologue boat scene . A few children are gamboling about Some of the farmers coming in carry muskets or pistols . One man even carries a broad-axe . HOUSTON has just entered to applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steps up on it . He wears no uniform but carries a sword at his side . A long red feather is stuck in his hat . He is accompanied by MERRITT who holds a large Texas flag aloft . ) PEOPLE General Houston ! Yay , Sam Houston ! That 's the man ! ( They grow quiet , waiting for him to speak. ) p. 60 SAM HOUSTON At this hour we celebrate the Declaration of Independence for Texas . But it is only a declaration . A brutal war to win that independence lies ahead of us . We are taking up arms in defense of our rights and liberties against a military tyrant . And we must defend these rights and liberties even unto death . A VOICE That we will , General . MAN ( lifting his broad-axe ) I 've got the right thing here to cut off a mess of Mexican heads .

Every Texan now  --  man , woman and child  --  must rally to the cause . There is work for all to do . The enemy is strong , but we will not flinch , we will not weaken . For our cause is just and under God is a righteous one ! ( The FLORES FAMILY enters and stands away somewhat to the rear ) p. 61 VOICES Yes , General Houston . True . We believe that .

SAM HOUSTON Yes , news  --  and I hope good news . Some days ago I ordered Colonel James Fannin at the earliest moment to quickmarch his men from Goliad to reinforce Travis . VOICES Thank God ! ( MERRITT sees BARBARA and moves nearer to her . ) ANOTHER VOICE Heaven be praised ! A WOMAN I pray God they arrive in time . ANOTHER VOICE It is many a mile from Goliad to the Alamo . SAM HOUSTON And now , my friends , we begin ! Captain Andrew Merritt will open the books for enlistments here and now . ( He steps down . MERRITT hands the flag to MURPH who is nearby and opens his book on top of the block . A number of men , including MURPH with the flag , line up .

SMITH is a wiry man of about fifty. ) p. 63 ERASTUS SMITH A message for you , General Houston . ( The people show their curiosity . SMITH hands the message to HOUSTON who looks at it . An involuntary groan breaks from him . He twists his head in pain . ) ANDY MERRITT ( Hurries up to him . ) What is it , sir ? PEOPLE Yes , what 's happened , General ' ( HOUSTON sinks weakly down on the block .

( She spits out the infectious word . ) VOICES ( in quick agreement ) Traitors ! Traitors ! ( Some of the people , led by REBECCA , make a rush toward JUAN and his family . For a moment it looks as if they will be beaten up . But MERRITT , DEAF SMITH , MURPH and others push the people back . ) ANDY MERRITT ( yelling ) Stop it ! Stop ! ( He has his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off and flees out at the right rear with her family . HOUSTON suddenly springs up on the block again .

( Some of the WOMEN shriek out their cries . ) WOMEN ( led by REBECCA ) We swear ! Avenge ! Avenge our dead ! SAM HOUSTON ( his face working with passion , the tears streaming down his cheeks ) Our battle cry  --  our victory cry shall be  --  ( His hat falls from his hand as he reaches two great fists high in the air. )  --  remember the Alamo ! p. 65 PEOPLE ( wildly , hysterically ) Remember the Alamo ! ( They rush up around HOUSTON , reaching toward him with clenched fists. ) @x An offscene bugle sounds the early 19th century American " assembly " call , passing into the old " charge " call . A bugle farther away answers back with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " call . Then the theatre music passes gaily into the " Yellow Rose of Texas " melody and plays the first part , some nine bars , and follows that with a part of the " Himno Nacional Mexicano , " some twelve bars . Then the two trumpets take over again in the above American calls and the latter half of the deguello , all sounding together , with a powerful snare drum roll and a bass drum thunder  --  booming under them through the last three or four bars , some two minutes in all . The audience lights go down and out . GAIL BORDEN appears at the left side stage area , the light coming in on him there . GAIL BORDEN ( strongly , dramatically ) General Houston threw himself into the job of forming a fighting force with all vigor and determination . His appeal went out to the United States . SAM HOUSTON Come with a good rifle and a hundred rounds of ammunition . You will receive generous grants of good Texas land . Long live liberty ! GAIL BORDEN But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Already Santa Anna , after capturing the Alamo , was moving eastward in four separate clean-up detachments . And Houston 's call for Texas men and arms went forth  --  from San Patricio on the west to Nacogdoches on the east . ( HOUSTON 'S VOICE is heard again in the sound track. ) p. 67 SAM HOUSTON The citizens of Texas must rally to the cause . Independence is declared , and the heroes of the Alamo have died for it . The service of all is required in the field , for this country must and will be defended ! ( BORDEN takes a step nearer the audience . An offscene snare drum gives its roll and stops . ) GAIL BORDEN And the people heard the trumpet sounding in the land  --  ( announcingly ) The farmers in the fields planting their corn ! ( The light dims down on him and holds and then comes on in something of a tight enclosure upstage right . The offscene snare drum begins again and continues . Three or four farmers with their womenfolk are revealed at their corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action is in choreographed motion  --  two steps forward , a dropped grain in the furrow , a side motion of the foot to cover the grain with soil , a stamp of the foot on the " hill " to pack it down , then two steps forward , again the dropped grain , the side swipe of the foot , the stamp down , and so on  --  never any slower , never any faster . The light moves with the workers as they move . A far-off summoning bugle blows . The workers hear it . The men look off , wipe their foreheads with their sleeves . They must answer that bugle . Now follows the business of farewell  --  embraces , tears , but prideful ones . The men pick up their invisible muskets and march away . The women lift their heads determinedly and now plant their corn with increased tempo . The light dies out , the drum fades down. ) p. 68 GAIL BORDEN ( from the shadows ) And the cotton choppers in the field . ( The drum comes in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here five or six men and women are hoeing rhythmically away in the field , all in pantomime , under the burning sun , thinning the young plants and getting the grass out , all moving short step by short step forward as they hoe . The summoning bugle is heard . The chopping stops . The men mop their faces . They listen . They must respond . Again the business of farewell . One of the women choppers is heavily pregnant . Her husband bends and kisses her lips , then puts his cheek against her belly for an instant . Muskets are lifted in pantomime and the men march away . The drum dies . The light fades . ) GAIL BORDEN ( still from the shadows ) People building their cabin homes  --  strength for the heavy timbers , the heavy timbers ! ( The light comes on upstage center . Several men enter there carrying in pantomime heavy logs on their shoulders  --  two by two . Offscene we hear the sounds of chopping , hammering , sawing , etc . The distant bugle blows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set to lower their logs , when several young women run in . In pantomime they ask that they be allowed to carry on . The men joshingly lower the logs onto their shoulders . Their knees buckle under them . More women rush in They carry the timbers staggeringly off . The men make their farewells , lift their invisible muskets and march away . The drum stops . The light fades and comes up again on BORDEN. ) p. 69 GAIL BORDEN General Houston soon had the makings  --  ( He pronounces the word interpretatively. )  --  of a fighting force . One part , under Colonel James Fannin , was stationed at Goliad to watch for any approach of the enemy down the San Antonio River . The other , Houston began assembling at Gonzales to be under his own command . ( BORDEN turns to look to the rear . The sound of a snare drum is heard at the left rear . The light dies out on him and rises there . The VOICE OF MERRITT is heard at the left rear above the beating of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( A group of volunteers , led by MERRITT , comes along the berm from the left This is pretty much a raggle-taggle group , but each one marches with energy , and rifles and shotguns are carried at the ready . They march on along the berm to the right rear . The light fades . PRESIDENT BURNET 's voice is heard coming from the right side stage area . The light comes up there showing a room in a farmhouse near the Guadalupe River . It is a bare place , save for a table and a stool or two . HOUSTON , BURNET , RUSK , ZAVALA and POTTER are gathered about a map on the table . HOCKLEY stands just to the right ESAU waits in the background . ) DAVID G. BURNET ( always conscious of his high position as president ) I say make a stand here , General Houston . ( He indicates on the map . ) What say you , Rusk and Potter ? As Secretary of War and Secretary of the Navy , you both have voices . p. 70 ROBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the place to fight . THOMAS J. RUSK I fear the risk , sir . SAM HOUSTON ( suddenly , roughly ) I will send an order to Colonel Fannin at once to fall back and blow up the fortification at Goliad as he leaves . DAVID G. BURNET Right , right , I so command it . ROBERT POTTER We approve . THOMAS J. RUSK If only Bowie and Travis had obeyed the same orders at the Alamo ! DAVID G. BURNET ( sharply ) They delayed Santa Anna 's march several days , Mr. Rusk . THOMAS J. RUSK At what a cost , Mr. President Their help here as living men would have been ten times more valuable . SAM HOUSTON I will order Fannin to join me here  --  ( He puts his finger on the map and almost barks out his words. )  --  at the headwaters of the Lavaca ! ( There is a reaction among the men . ) DAVID G. BURNET ( sharply ) But that is thirty miles east of here  --  east ! ROBERT POTTER ( blazingly ) General Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. BURNET That would be retreating ! ( He looks appealingly about him . ) The people of Texas would be outraged for us to back away from a fight . ROBERT POTTER We 've got to stand firm , Houston . SAM HOUSTON ( trying to keep his temper ) And get the living daylights beat out of us , Mr. President ? Me and my weak forces . Gentlemen , where is the Mexican power ? In the leadership of one man , Santa Anna . Someday , somewhere , somehow , he and I must meet . I can not afford to lose one man to any other foe . Mr. Zavala here knows the man , has worked with him in the old liberal days of Mexico . I ask your opinion as Vice-President of Texas , sir . LORENZO DE ZAVALA He is the key to victory or defeat . I agree the showdown has to be with him . DAVID G. BURNET ( with a wail ) But what will happen to the people of Texas if you retreat ? They ca n't be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will have to evacuate their homes . ROBERT POTTER And the Mexicans will burn those houses behind them . SAM HOUSTON Houses can be rebuilt , but dead men ca n't be brought to life , and I do n't propose to lead my men to death . I have already warned the people of Gonzales here that they might have to leave . p. 72 DAVID G. BURNET ( firmly , now getting control of himself ) I have heard your  --  er  --  excuses , General Houston . The war is just beginning and I will try to be patient . SAM HOUSTON ( somewhat sharply to POTTER ) We have not heard a report from our Secretary of Navy Mr. Potter . All our efforts on land must have some protection from the sea . How goes it with our Texas Navy , sir ? ROBERT POTTER You wo n't find me retreating no matter how small we are . ( He pulls a memorandum from his pocket and speaks in strong , authoritative words as he glances at it . ) We have the ship Liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William S.

BURNET ( Claps his hands in applause . Heartily . ) Good , good ! And your plans , General , for meeting the enemy on land  --  I repeat , why not here ? ( His forefinger stabs the place on the map. ) p. 73 SAM HOUSTON I am still trying to gather some sort of army . Every day some recruits are arriving . DAVID G. BURNET But with Colonel Fannin 's men here at Goliad coming up to join with yours  --  SAM HOUSTON ( a little crisply ) I repeat , we are not ready to fight , sir . DAVID G. BURNET ( at the map again ) General Santa Anna is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way . DAVID G. BURNET And General Joaquin Sesma is  --  across the Guadalupe River here . SAM HOUSTON Yes , Mr. President . DAVID G. BURNET We hear the size of his force  --  is hardly six hundred men . SAM HOUSTON ( He nods . ) Our scout Deaf Smith estimates so . DAVID G. BURNET And here is marked General Jose Urrea west of Goliad where Colonel Fannin is stationed . ROBERT POTTER Strange that Santa Anna should keep his forces so separated . SAM HOUSTON To spread terror among the people , ( with a chuckle ) And he is combing the country widely in search of me and my men . p. 74 DAVID G. BURNET Search ? SAM HOUSTON It is my purpose , gentlemen , to keep moving  --  build up my  --  er  --  army , train it  --  and to wait  --  and wait  --  and  --  DAVID G. BURNET And all the while the enemy will grow stronger . SAM HOUSTON Perhaps the reverse , sir , as he moves farther and farther from his bases and as we turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( muttering ) Turn and twist . I say you should make a quick attack across the river on General Sesma . What do you say , Mr. Potter ? ROBERT POTTER Catch him by surprise . SAM HOUSTON And if I lose , sir ? DAVID G. BURNET ( sharply ) We do not intend you to lose , General Houston . Mr. Zavala ? ( ZAVALA lifts his hand but makes no reply . ) SAM HOUSTON And if we beat Sesma , what of it ? Santa Anna and the others remain . We 'll have scotched the snake maybe , but not killed him . It 's the snake we 're after  --  the snake . ( He lets go the map and pounds his palm with his fist . ) DAVID G. BURNET I say attack Sesma across the river . p. 75 ROBERT POTTER So do I. SAM HOUSTON ( hiding his irrigation ) The government has appointed me General of the Texas Army  --  ( gesturing off )  --  the army I 'm trying to build and will build . I intend , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Anna . I 'll have to . ( HOCKLEY rolls up the map . ) DAVID G. BURNET Trick ? SAM HOUSTON When your enemy is strong and you are weak , what is better , sir ? ( taking the map from HOCKLEY ) Santa Anna  --  that 's the man , Mr. President , Santa Anna , now dictator and tyrant . By heavens , sir , some day I will meet him  --  some day when I 'm ready . DAVID G. BURNET Some day . SAM HOUSTON Let Santa Anna call himself the " Napoleon of the West , " but these Napoleons somewhere can make a mistake , somewhere can be tricked , yes , out-thought , out-maneuvered , even as we retreat , you call it  --  as we retire , I call it . DAVID G. BURNET Come , gentlemen . In spite of my high position my advice seems unwelcome . The Commander-in-Chief wishes to have things his own way . We must return to Washington-on-the- Brazos  --  we must continue to govern . ( He starts off , then turns back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's orders , General Houston . And you keep us informed . That is a command . ( He and POTTER go away . HOUSTON salutes with his sword . ZAVALA and RUSK turn , shake hands quickly with HOUSTON and go . HOUSTON sits quickly to the table and writes a dispatch . HOCKLEY steps forward. ) p. 76 SAM HOUSTON Major Hockley , get this on the way to Colonel Fannin at Goliad at once . General Urrea is moving from the west toward Goliad and there is no time to lose . GEORGE HOCKLEY Yes , sir . ( He salutes , takes the message and hurries away . HOUSTON stretches his arms and clenches his fists in the air . ) ESAU I got you some coffee here , suh . ( ESAU brings a mug forward . HOUSTON drinks from it .

THOMAS J. RUSK I agree he is most persuasive . ( He salutes and HOUSTON returns the salute . He goes , and HOUSTON unrolls a map , looks at it and then sits staring ahead of him thinking . ) ( A little summoning bell is heard in the darkness of the right side stage .

The open neutrality of this country must be maintained . I can not help you . Signed  --  Andrew Jackson , President .

She goes on with some bitterness . ) No man craves glory more than Sam Houston . STEPHEN F. AUSTIN But a dispatch speaks of his constant retreating , staying out of Santa Anna 's reach . You do n't win glory that way . MARY AUSTIN HOLLEY Sam Houston will win it any way he can . STEPHEN F. AUSTIN ( He takes her hand . ) Dear Mary  --  sweet and wonderful cousin  --  listen to me .

This is the first history of Texas .

She kisses him ardently . ) STEPHEN F. AUSTIN Is that the way cousins kiss ? MARY AUSTIN HOLLEY ( teasingly ) Well , maybe as a beginning .

He is sitting as before . CAPTAIN WYLEY MARTIN enters . He speaks up without saluting . ) WYLEY MARTIN My men are still in rebellious mood , General Houston . So are Captain Baker 's men . We have not been able to quiet their complaints . SAM HOUSTON What has happened to your authority , Captain Martin ? ( He stands suddenly up , so suddenly that MARTIN steps back . ) WYLEY MARTIN ( half-stutteringly ) Er  --  yes , sir  --  but they 've reached the limit , they say . Is tomorrow to be more retreating ? They demand to know . p. 96 SAM HOUSTON And I expect you and your men to obey my commands . WYLEY MARTIN ( stolidly ) Is it more retreating , sir ? SAM HOUSTON And if I refuse to answer ? WYLEY MARTIN We would take that as an answer . SAM HOUSTON By swift marching I estimate we will be near the Brazos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . WYLEY MARTIN My God , General Houston , less than a week ago you said the Mexicans would never reach the Brazos ! What 's to stop them now ? SAM HOUSTON As the poet says  --  and I recommend Robert Burns to you  --  the plans of mice and men gang aft a-gley . I have to live a day at a time , Captain Martin . The advance of Santa Anna forces me to change my mind . WYLEY MARTIN Captain Baker and I have nearly a hundred and fifty men in our commands . We will retreat no farther than the Brazos . This is final . ( HOUSTON stares at him . MARTIN stands his ground . ) SAM HOUSTON Strongly put , sir . WYLEY MARTIN And as strongly meant . SAM HOUSTON So you propose to go no farther than the Brazos. p. 97 WYLEY MARTIN That 's right , sir . SAM HOUSTON ( with sudden buoyance ) Good , good ! Then you and Captain Mosely Baker can help save my little army . You and your men shall take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Felipe crossing . ( He has the map open now in front of MARTIN . ) And with your riflemen hid among the trees here , you can prevent Santa Anna 's crossing . You could delay him several days . You and Baker will become heroes , Captain Martin , and your names will ring through Texas . ( saluting ) Good night , sir . ( MARTIN shifts about uneasily a bit , stares at him , shakes his head , turns and starts away , remembers his salute , gives it , then hurries off . ) ( ESAU chuckles from the shadows . ) SAM HOUSTON All right , Esau ? ESAU Mighty all right , sir . This war sure is a funny business . Is we gon na rest heah , General , suh ? SAM HOUSTON ( with heavy weariness ) Yes , once more , with God 's good roof over us .
