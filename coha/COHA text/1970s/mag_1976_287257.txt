Like the sages of his native India , Organic Chemist and Nobel Laureate* Har Gobind Khorana is an extremely patient man . Nine years ago , he began working on the chemical synthesis of a single gene-the basic unit of heredity . By 1970 he had constructed a yeast-cell gene identical to the original-except for one thing : it lacked the vital " start " and " stop " signals to make it function in a living cell . Last week members of Khorana 's team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology disclosed that his goal had finally been achieved . At an American Chemical Society meeting in San Francisco , they announced that using only off-the-shelf chemicals , they had made an artificial gene that does all the work of its natural counterpart . <P> Like Beads . Khorana 's creation is a duplicate of one of the thousands of genes in the spiral-staircase structure of the DNA molecule in the common intestinal bacterium E. coli . Unlike human genes , which include millions of chemical " steps " along much larger DNA molecules , this bacterial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of letters in the genetic code . Consisting of chemicals called nucleotides , these letters make up words in the gene 's message-in this case , instructions to transfer the amino acid tyrosine to the cell 's protein-manufacturing centers . <P> Duplicating the gene 's basic structure , which had been determined earlier by British researchers , was extremely tedious , trial-and-error work . Each scientist on Khorana 's team was assigned to assemble 1% segments of DNA . This involved chemically linking one nucleotide to another , like beads of a necklace , until a chain ten to 12 nucleotides long had been created . Eventually the team built up 40 segments , all of them single stranded . These had to be paired to form double-stranded DNA segments that had to be connected end to end in proper sequence to duplicate the bacterial gene . In the course of their work , Khorana and his colleagues built not only the basic gene but the hitherto elusive start and stop signals at either end . When the synthetic gene was inserted into an E. coli cell with the help of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly . <P> Unlike other experiments in " genetic engineering " ( TIME , July 19 ) , Khorana 's work apparently does not pose dangers . For one thing , the gene is assembled with control signals , which enables scientists to prevent runaway activity . Also , there is no attempt to produce new gene combinations from different organisms that could accidentally breed mutants against which humans or other life have no natural defenses . Indeed , some scientists see in gene synthesis enormous potential for good . It could , for example , eventually be used to replace defective genes in ailing humans-in hemophiliacs , say . It may also bring new understanding-and possibly control-of cancer by explaining why the genes suddenly order the rampages of cell growth characteristic of the killer disease . <P> <P> *For his role in deciphering the genetic code .
