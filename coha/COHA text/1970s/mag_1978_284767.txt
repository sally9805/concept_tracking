A FLANN O'BRIEN READER , edited by Stephen Jones ; Viking/ Richard Seaver ; 447 pages ; $15 <P> Once there were these three Irishmen . Brian O'Nolan joined the civil service as a young fellow and retired 18 years later with a small pension and a sharp tongue . Before he was 30 , Flann O'Brien had published a novel ( At Swim-Two-Birds ) that won praise from no less a boyo than Jimmy Joyce . Myles na Gopaleen took up writing the odd play now and then but spent close to 25 years doing funny pieces for the newspapers . Now here 's a strange thing . All three of these lads died at the same instant on April Fools ' Day 1966 . <P> All three lads were , of course , one and the same . If it is still not clear exactly why Brian O'Nolan had the impulse and gall to divide himself into three parts , something else unquestionably is : the unholy trinity of Brian/Flann/Myles added up to one of the most gifted comic writers of this century . <P> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen Jones has collected samples from four novels , a long Gaelic tale , stories , essays , teleplays and reams of humorous journalism . Jumbled together in this manner , the pieces gradually reveal a single mind behind the pseudonyms , one that was drunk with words and more than ready to defend fair language at the drop of a solecism . <P> It did not much matter which language , either . Flann was comfortable in German , French and Latin , although his English prose style was most thoroughly affected by his knowledge of Gaelic . He regularly mocked those nationalists and bicycling anthropologists who made the preservation of Gaelic a sacred mission . In The Poor Mouth ( 1941 ) a long tale written in the old language , O'Brien shows a linguist from Dublin religiously transcribing the grunts of a western Irish pig . Flann even joked about the impulse that led him to learn his native tongue : " Having nothing to say , I thought at the time that it was important to revive a distant language in which absolutely nothing could be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Brien turned temporarily serious about the language that " enables us to transform the English language and this seems to hold of people who know little or no Irish , like Joyce . It seems to be an inbred thing . " <P> This gift sustained him through all his diverse careers . Nothing fades faster than newspaper humor , and some of the Myles na Gopaleen columns that Editor Jones resurrects should have stayed in the morgue . Many pieces , though , seem remarkably fresh . Humbug and absurdity have not gone out of fashion , and Myles was keenly aware of both . When a local judge levied a stiff jail term on a woman who had been caught shoplifting , the journalist commented : " I suppose he was right when he said there was far too much shoplifting in Dublin but I am not clear how one calculates what is the right amount of shoplifting for Dublin . " He took figures of speech literally and then offered advice on solving problems that only he could discern : how to keep blood from curdling , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
