Among Americans , it is almost an article of faith that the water flowing from their faucets is fit to drink . Last week the Department of Health , Education and Welfare dealt that faith a shattering blow . In a survey of 969 of the country 's 23,000 water-supply systems , HEW 's Bureau of Water Hygiene found that some 900,000 persons in the tested areas were consuming water dangerously contaminated by such poisons as arsenic , lead , selenium and fecal bacteria . The water supply of another 2,000,000 , though safe to drink , was held to be unacceptable in taste , odor or color . Since the bureau 's survey sites were chosen as " reasonably representative , " its report , projected to the entire population , could mean that millions of Americans are drinking water hazardous to their health . Some of the most troublesome spots : <P> - Vermont , most of whose water-supply systems " generally exhibit the effects of long-term neglect . " The bureau also found that there had been at least 300 cases of " waterborne " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report was issued , Government health officials followed up by advising 35,555 Vermonters served by 69 " undesirable " systems to boil their water before drinking it . <P> - Cincinnati , where a " continuous program to detect health hazards and sanitary defects . . . does not exist , " and where infectious hepatitis , traced to the city 's water supply , broke out in a new federal housing project . <P> - Charleston , S.C. , where the water falls below Public Health Service standards and procedures for handling chlorine used in purifying water are " unsafe . " <P> - The San **28;4647;TOOLONG County region in Southern California , whose 1,000,000 residents are drinking water from systems with " generally minimal " treatment facilities . <P> - College Park , S.C . This town is serviced by an " undesirable " water supply source . As a result , the bacterial and chemical quality of the water is poor and storage capacity is inadequate . Government officials also found no records of laboratory examinations to test for water purity . <P> - Riverhead , N.Y . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen sulfide odor , the town 's new treatment plant manager blamed fluoridation . Later investigation by county health officials revealed that a single well was introducing bacteria into the system . <P> - Long Island , N.Y. , where launderettes are contaminating private wells with detergents . The county has brought suit against 78 launderettes which have no treatment facilities and which continue to pollute wells . <P> Overall , water systems serving 100,000 persons or more got favorable marks . Most of the contaminated water was found in small communities , where the water systems lack either the staff , the know-how or the will to assure consumers a safe drink . <P> This point is driven home by the report 's statistics . Some 77% of the plant operators surveyed were inadequately trained ; nearly half of them were deficient in chemistry related to plant operation . In 1968 , the year prior to the study , 79% of the plants were not inspected , and 90% of the water-treatment systems failed to meet Government standards for frequency of inspections.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
