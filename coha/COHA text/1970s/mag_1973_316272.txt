THIS is a marriage that has arrived at middle age , " says Italian Columnist Arrigo Levi of the longstanding relationship between the U.S. and Europe . " It needs some sexual stimulation . " This year the diplomatic stimulation across the Atlantic will be more intense than it has been in years . It will take place in a changed atmosphere : the old and comfortable relationship of a protective America and a dependent Europe has given way to one of rivalry . <P> If anything , this new relationship is likely to intensify Europe 's perennial if ambiguous fascination with the mystery that is America . In 1830 that observant Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville saw in America " the image of democracy itself , with its inclinations , its prejudices and its passions . " A century and a half later , another astute French observer , Jean-Franois Revel ( Without Marx or Jesus ) described America as " an example for all democracies and all technological societies today . " Other observers argue that America is an example of precisely what other modern nations should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions on the U.S. is as broad and varied as Europe itself . In the north , for instance , Sweden 's opposition to the war in Viet Nam has spilled over into continuing , virulent anti-Americanism . Far to the south , the average Italian , says University of Rome Sociologist Francesco Ferrarotti , " has a deep sense of almost compulsive admiration for Americans . " <P> In between , there is the mixed opinion of the West Germans . Says Ulrich Littmann , executive director of the Fulbright Commission in Germany : " The German has an optically broken picture of the Americans . It 's like a beam of light hitting the water . He thinks of the U.S. in terms of the people who sent men to the moon , the people who are portrayed in western movies and TV thrillers , the people who conducted a war in Viet Nam . " The same German who goes out and throws a stone through the window of America House in protest of the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong cheers the U.S. military band marching in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plagues the French . Says Revel , France 's best-known America watcher : " The French are , of course , ignorant of American society in any case . They live a continual ambiguity . On the one hand , they are unconsciously seduced and fascinated by American life , and they love to imitate it . On the other hand , it is almost a national custom to reject U.S. actions and disparage American institutions out of hand . " <P> European attitudes toward the U.S. are to some extent determined by age . To most people over 40 in Western Europe , America still represents the deliverance from the evil that was Nazism . There is a middle-range group of leftist intellectuals , roughly in their early 30s , who are violently anti-American because they consider the U.S. the model of a capitalist , imperialist society . The young generally see the U.S. as a corrupt military-industrial establishment - even as they absorb and emulate the latest made-in-America styles in rock sounds , drugs and fashions.               @ @ @ @ @ @
