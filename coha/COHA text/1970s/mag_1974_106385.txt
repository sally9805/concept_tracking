Let 's Get Involved , " read the message in masking tape on a window at the training camp of the Buffalo Bills . Losers since 1967 , the Bills got involved last year , winning nine games , rushing for an NFL-record 3,088 yards and leading the league in attendance . // Coach Lou Saban used the draft , half a dozen free agents and deals involving 45 players to find support for O.J. Simpson , most notably a youthful offensive line that turned the Juice loose for 2,003 yards and eight rushing records . In 1969 , Californian Simpson had considered joining the short-lived Continental League rather than play in remote , often frigid Buffalo . But now he even has a home in a Buffalo suburb called Chapel Woods . // This year the offensive line may improve further if the Bills'No. 1 pick , Reuben Gant , can recover from a preseason shoulder separation and move in at tight end . Paul Seymour , a booming blocker who caught only 10 passes at that position last year , would then replace Tackle Dave Foley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line must do without young Jeff Winans , a fierce performer who tore knee ligaments in training , but End Bob Kampa , a bull-riding enthusiast , and 6 ' 5 " , 274-pound Tackle Mike Kadish are hale and hearty . Rookie Doug Allen adds depth to the linebacking corps , which is youthful . Except for All-NFL Cornerback Robert James , so is the secondary . // " We 'll throw more , but not significantly more , " says Quarterback Joe Ferguson . He passed only 164 times last season but this year , with bump-and-run coverage limited , speedy J. D. Hill may shake loose often enough to match the 52-catch season he had two years ago . And the Bills have acquired Ahmad Rashad from St. Louis . He caught 59 passes for 909 yards in 1972 when his name was Bobby Moore . Power running and blocking is expected from Fullback Jim Braxton , who missed eight games last year with a back injury . // " In our system we can give or fake to the fullback , " Ferguson says . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of six yards a crack he may get 20 . " A preseason victory over Washington had Saban beaming on his weekly TV show . " The Bills , " he said , " are nearing the top of the hill . " // But up there they will find Almighty Miami . Averaging six years of experience and two NFL championship rings per man , the Dolphins are just reaching their prime . The only immediate concern is aging ( 33 ) Middle Linebacker Nick Buoniconti ; he injured a thigh against Los Angeles and will miss the opener . But Coach Don Shula is ready with hard-hitting Mike Kolen , who played the middle during the players ' strike , and second-year Linebacker Bruce Bannon , who made 17 tackles against Detroit last year . Vince Costello , who replaced Bill Arnsparger as defensive coach , will stay with a strategy that yielded only 3,281 total yards , third-fewest in the NFL. // Rookie Receivers Mel Baker and Nat Moore caught a lot of Miami 's preseason touchdown passes . They would be fine prospects elsewhere , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard Twilley. // Shula 's worries will begin next year when Warfield , Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick go to the WFL . Warfield 's loss had been anticipated , since he had said he would retire after this season . He caught only 29 passes in 1973 but 11 went for touchdowns . Mercury Morris , Miami 's chief outside threat , had already beaten out Kiick , but who can replace Csonka and his three straight years of 1,000-yard rushing ? " He does n't make 90-yard runs , " says teammate Bob Matheson , " but guys who tackle him wish he had . " It seems obvious , but look for the Dolphins again at the Super Bowl . // Baltimore reeled when General Manager Joe Thomas made 20 trades last year , dealing away nearly a dozen starters or former starters . Sixteen rookies and 31 understandably insecure veterans remained to lose 10 games , the Colts ' poorest performance in two decades . " No one knew what was up last year , " says Tight End Ray Chester . The Baltimore pass rush sacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60.1% of their passes against the Colts . Coach Howard Schnellenberger complains , " We had to play offense in a defensive manner . " // The Baltimore offense was not too bad at that . The Colts scored only 26 touchdowns , but Lydell Mitchell broke the team rushing record with 963 yards and Glenn Doughty averaged 23.5 yards on his 25 receptions , the second-highest average in the league . // This year Thomas parted with All-AFC Linebacker Ted Hendricks and anyone else who signed future contracts to play in the WFL , and a horde of new rookies infiltrated the Colts . Slowly the turmoil subsided . " We understand what 's being done now , " Chester says , and Quarterback Marty Domres adds , " Last year was very disjunctive . It was wait and see . Now we all drink beer together . " Four newcomers have come to the aid of the defense . Ends John Dutton and Fred Cook spent much of the preseason in opposing backfields , giving Baltimore a badly needed pass rush . Cornerback Doug Nettles moved right into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom MacLeod , who came to the Colts in the Hendricks deal . The main concern among the rookies was whether Roger Carr , a receiver who has speed and can catch , would let his crew cut grow . Veterans wondered how long Domres can hold off Bert Jones , a better thrower. // Schnellenberger must be concerned about what will happen if the Colts finish under .500 again . Reserve Receiver Ollie Smith , fast and graceful but used sparingly in 1973 , and John Andrews , shifting from tight end to fullback , along with Punter David Lee , who can kick for height , may turn out to be plus factors that will keep Schnellenberger at the helm. // New England Coach Chuck Fairbanks , discounting rookies , says , " Our greatest chance for improvement is for the players we have already to improve . " Whatever dissatisfaction Fairbanks felt about the Patriots ' 5-9 season was concentrated on the defensive line , which yielded 5.1 yards per carry . O.J. alone swept through New England for 469 yards in two games , almost 25% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a 3-4 defense , hoping his linebackers will be an asset in a gang-tackling defense . The secondary , headed by Cornerback Ron Bolton , gave New England the second-best figures for pass defense in 1973 , but that could be misleading since most teams took the easier ground route to clobber the Patriots. // Quarterback Jim Plunkett 's totals of 193 completions for 2,550 yards were bettered only by Roman Gabriel . Plunkett has an army of fleet receivers . Reggie Rucker caught 53 passes , and Darryl Stingley , Randy Vataha and Bob Windsor each had at least 20 . Expect more bam out of Fullback Sam Cunningham , who last season was disconcerted by his 10 fumbles . The sweetest 18 attempts and 35 consecutive PATs to lead the Atlantic Coast League in scoring . // Fairbanks believes the rule changes open the door for an attack like the Wishbone and the Patriots might try it . " I 've got the quarterback , " Fairbanks says , meaning Jack Mildren , who played for him at Oklahoma and who was acquired from Baltimore . But Fairbanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improving on 5-9 will border on the miraculous . // Charley Winner supplants his father-in-law Weeb Ewbank in New York ( the Jets ' current highlight film is called End of an Era ) . One problem is fragile Joe Namath , who has not played a full season since 1969 . He missed seven weeks last year with a separated shoulder . His offensive line does not look strong . Emerson Boozer rolled up 831 yards , his best as a pro , but he is in his ninth season , rare for a running back . Fourth-year man John Riggins followed his near-1,000-yard performance in 1972 with a contract dispute and a disappointing 482 yards last year . // Winner , who is only 5 ' 6 " , 138 pounds , drafted size . Tackle Carl Barzilauskas is 6 ' 6 " , 265 and even better than expected . But Linebacker Godwin Turk , 6 ' 3 " and 230 , may miss the entire season because of a dislocated shoulder . // The Jets again have good receivers . Jerome Barkum , Rich Caster and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year beat out Don Maynard . Maynard used to attach a feather to his helmet during the glory days , and Caster still tucks one in his sock . If the Jets can improve on their 4-10 mark , it would put a feather in Winner 's hat . But the offensive line must develop or this will be the year Joe Namath gets creamed for good .
