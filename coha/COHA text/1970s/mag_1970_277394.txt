NO , there is no escaping Christmas cards , not even in these days of recession . For better or worse , they have become one of America 's unavoidable , conventional and yet curiously revelatory means of communication . Seemingly carriers of good will , their messages are both specialized and highly descriptive of the condition of U.S. society . The ready availability of MERRY CHRISTMAS , GREAT-GRANDMOTHER cards tells a lot about the longevity of the modern female ; great-grandfather cards , by contrast , are less easy to find . Ethnic cards with black , brown or yellow Santas testify to the fact that the American melting pot is still bubbling , despite gloomy assertions to the contrary . Some cards even display the extent to which the celebration of Jesus ' birth has become a festival for non-Christians . One this year contains a poem called ' T was the Night Before Chanukah , which ends with a jolly fat man in " a little red yamalke " urging his reindeer into the night : <P> Now Izzie ! Now Morris ! Now Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Hymie and Manny ! <P> On the statistical average , each American adult this season will send , and receive , at least 15 cards . That means the bells of stationery store cash registers will ring up U.S. sales of $300 million this Christmas-glad tidings to about 200 card companies . Like the automakers , the card publishers alter their models annually . Some cards now laud the joys of grass-not the kind that suburbanites mow .

The themes of " love " and " youth " - perhaps as an indirect tribute to Mr. Agnew-have replaced " peace " as the most prevalent messages this year . But most cards , as always , aim at traditional sentimentality , unabashedly celebrating the permanence of that emotion in a changing world . <P> To find the proper message , shoppers can browse for hours . The plethora of choice includes specific cards with appropriate illustrations for family and lovers , ministers and nuns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beyond that , there are nuances to weigh . Should a card be heavily embossed , or wear what the card companies refer to as " flitter " ( a grainy sparkle ) or " flock " ( a fuzzy felt ) ? And which is most appropriate : TO MY DOCTOR , TO A FINE DOCTOR , Or TO A WONDERFUL DOCTOR ? <P> Hallmark , American Greetings , Norcross and other card companies know precisely what they are doing . With the help of market research and psychological expertise , they have isolated no fewer than 3,000 " sending situations , " that define the basic religious and emotional needs of both sender and recipient . One card , for example , is designed to calm the nervous traveler with best wishes " from takeoff till landing . " Another transmits to a permanent invalid " loving thoughts of you " - tactfully avoiding the conventional " get well quick . " CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW PAD , says a card for blacks , THERE GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
