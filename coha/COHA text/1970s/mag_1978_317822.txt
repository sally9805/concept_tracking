PARADISE ALLEY Directed and Written by Sylvester Stallone <P> Two movies after Rocky , Sylvester Stallone is down but not out . His new film is not the comeback picture that Stallone needs to recover fully from the debacle of F.I.S.T. , but neither is it a complete fail ure . At times Paradise Alley looks like a catastrophe : it is often crudely made , badly acted and unwittingly ridiculous . Yet the film does n't chase the audience out of the theater , as F.I.S.T . did . Just when the going gets roughest , this crazy movie springs into idiosyncratic , if fleeting life . <P> As an exercise in egomania , Paradise Alley almost puts Barbra Streisand 's A Star Is Born to shame . Besides starring in the film , Stallone wrote the script ( from his own novel , no less ) , directed it and sings the theme song . The plot , far too structurally ambitious for a novice director , is a cynical attempt to cash in on every ' 40s movie cliche not used in Rocky and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story tells of three downtrodden brothers who dream of breaking out of Manhattan 's impoverished Hell 's Kitchen : a lame World War II vet ( Armand Assante ) , a loudmouthed schemer ( Stallone ) and a dumb but sweet aspiring wrestler ( Lee Canalito ) . As Alice Kramden of TV 's The Honeymooners might put it , what we have here are a gimp , a blimp and a simp . <P> When dealing with bedrock matters of story and character , Paradise Alley is an utter mess . Stallone 's two co-stars are blanks on the screen ; their personal metamorphoses are too sketchily written and acted to have any impact . The men 's love interests ( Anne Archer , Joyce Ingalls , Aimee Eccles ) are all crassly conceived stereotypes ; there is even a hooker with a heart of gold . Whatever credibility exists in the screenplay is soon destroyed by Stallone 's direction . Paradise Alley is a cinematic minefield of bizarre transitions , cryptic anecdotes , continuity lapses and mushy dissolves . Despite Laszlo Kovacs ' first-rate cinematography and Deborah Beaudet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home movie . <P> The huge set pieces come off a bit better , especially so in the case of a tumultuous fight scene that parallels the climax of Rocky . But it is really around its fringes that Paradise Alley becomes interesting . Kevin Conway , as a James Cagney-inspired hood , brings savage , roughhouse wit to some incidental barroom scenes . In the expendable role of a has-been black wrestler , Frank McRae is a knockout . Though playing a slow-witted loser without money or friends , this actor retains a delicate sense of dignity . His two brief scenes carry more emotional weight than all the rest of Paradise Alley .
