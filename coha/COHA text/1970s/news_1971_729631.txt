txt He had changed . It was late July , 1971 And as he stepped out into the bright New Mexico sun for the first time in two years he was wearing a yellow shirt open at the neck , and tan trousers His eyes were brimming with emotion ; his face was interrupted by a wide slashing smile ; his manner was subdued , respectful . Reies Tijerina had returned ' nome from prison . His arms upraised were for the cheers of a hundred friends , relatives , and followers come to meet him . But his running steps were toward his two little children , Isabel and Carlos , so young they hardly knew him . He had changed . But so had the times . It seemed long ago , that hectic July 4 years before , when Reies Tijerina had led the raid on the county courthouse at Tierra Amarilla in northern New Mexico . Fire was in his eyes , evangelism in his voice . He was driven by a vision of cultural renewal for his people . Hopes galvanized For months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern New Mexico mountain land . He had come out of Texas , the son of a timid sharecropper , an itinerant jackleg preacher with the windmill gesturing arms and the soaring Chicano rhetoric . His life became a single-minded purpose ? to wrest back from the Anglos millions of acres of land he believed illegally taken from Spanish-speaking people . In the back-lands his Alianza soon had several thousand adherents . For a century there had been organizations trying to win back Spanish land ' in the Southwest . Reies Tijerina , as no man before him , galvanized that effort and lent it focus . In the summer of ' 67 , frustrated with just rhetoric , he led the raid on the Tierra Amarilla courthouse and became a hunted man ? and finally a convicted one . He went to prison for two years in 1969 for assaulting a forest ranger and destroying forest-service signs . He still is appealing charges but now is out on parole . Terrible price ' paid One Chicano says simply of Tijerina , " He dared to step out of the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to this Appalachia of the Southwest . He paid a terrible price , but he gave us back our manhood . " When Tijerina went to prison , the Chicano movement in New Mexico began to fracture again . But it was different from before . Now in small towns and in the barrios of the cities a new kind of leadership is springing up from the people . It is answerable to no other group and to no one man or one agency 's money . The goals are no longer so grandiose , ambitious or unreachable . The new leadership is no less angered by dispossession from the land than Tijerina himself . They look with suspicion on urban-renewal programs in the cities . And they are working , as Tijerina did , toward cultural renovation of Chicano life . But instead they are legally seizing control of city governments in small Texas towns where they hold a majority of the votes . They are forming neighborhood groups and pushing antidrug programs . They are trying to defeat unfriendly city councilmen or to infiltrate community-action groups . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Less charisma , more involvement None of their leaders are flamboyant in the Tijerina style . Few are even well known . Their names drop unfamiliar on most ears ? Pedro Archuleta m Tierra Amarilla , Richard Moore in Albuquerque , Samuel Leyba and Daniel Gurule in Santa Fe . Not a Tijerina among them . This low-profile leadership has given the Chicano movement less charisma , but also less vulnerability and more involvement . As for Reies himself , they have welcomed him home Many of them were at the Albuquerque airport to shout , " Viva ! " when he arrived . One day he may return with all the " . ! macho " that made him loved by Chicanos , hated by the establishment , and a legend in the Southwest . But for now he has returned bereft of the ringing rhetoric of his land-grant war days : " They took your land and gave you powdered milk , took your grazing and gave you Smokey the Bear , took your language and gave you lies in theirs . There are 1,715 land grants in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He came home instead saying , quietly , " In 775 days in prison I found justice in my heart and I want to dedicate those days to the people of New Mexico I hope those days will bring peace and understanding to the people of New Mexico and the whole Southwest . That 's my dream . "
