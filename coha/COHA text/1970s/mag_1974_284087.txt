Like the famed " bullet train " that rockets from Tokyo to Kyoto at 125 m.p.h. , Japanese wage rates are rushing ahead at a speed unmatched anywhere else . In last month 's shunto , or " spring offensive , " Japanese unions won pay raises for 35 million workers averaging 31.4%-the biggest across-the-board increase on record for any industrialized society . The boosts will place many once lowly paid Japanese workers on a par with their European counterparts . The typical steel worker 's pay ( not including fringe benefits ) rose from the 1973 level of $493 a month to $650 . Auto workers ' incomes spurted from $480 to $610 , while cotton-mill employees , historically the nation 's most poorly paid industrial workers , got their paychecks fattened by $120 , to $470 . <P> But last week , before the Japanese worker had much of a chance to either save his new-found wealth or spend it on the television sets and tape recorders that he makes , doubts spread as to whether anyone had really won any thing worthwhile . Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a vicious wage-price spiral that would boomerang against consumers and threaten Japan 's competitiveness in world markets . The workers themselves , who had gone so far as to stage a two-day transportation strike to press their demands , concede gloomily that most of their gains have al ready been wiped out by Japan 's virulent inflation . Living costs so far this year are running 21% ahead of 1973 . <P> Says a young accountant for a large cement company : " The big pay raise does n't put me any closer to my dream of owning my own home .

Already , electric-power rates are scheduled to rise in August by 40% , and shipping costs by one-third . Even before the wage increase , sales of Japanese automobiles in the U.S. were running at only 60% of 1973 's level , in part because prices have climbed 5% to 10% above those of comparable American makes . A Toyota official says that the wage boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of Japan predicts that by next year it will be cheaper to produce such electronic products as television sets , radios and calculators in the U.S. than in Japan , a belief underscored by the recent decisions of Sony , Matsushita and Hitachi to start manufacturing in the U.S. <P> Just how badly the wage increase will hurt the export sales on which Japan is so dependent is still uncertain . Some economists believe that its chief impact will be to weed out inefficient , labor-intensive industries . The government reported last week that April 's exports set a postwar record , rising a stunning 61.3% over the same month a year ago . The climb was led by efficient industries , such as steel and shipbuilding , that are benefiting from worldwide shortages . The latest wage increase follows one of 23.6% in 1973 and an average hike of 15% annually during the previous decade . Despite Japan 's legendary productivity ( up 20.1% in 1973 ) , Finance Minister Takeo Fukuda claims that the economy can no longer withstand such boosts .
