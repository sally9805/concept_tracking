I DOUBT THAT AMONG ATHLETES there is any group as inept at golf as football linemen . That generalization may he as unsteady as the one which states there are no pianos in Japan , but I , for one , have never seen a tackle or a guard on the golf course whose caddy for safety 's sake did n't tend to keep the golf bag between him and the ball when the lineman was sashaying back and forth and getting ready to hit . The lineman who comes invariably to mind when I consider these matters is Alex Karras , the great Detroit All-Pro tackle . His actions on a football field are as confident and quick and erratic as the motions of a dragonfly above a pond ; but on the golf course an earthbound quality and something of the hermit crab take over . His golf swing is a quick furious swooping snatch at the ball , which from a distance looks as if he were flailing at something that had got inside his shoe ; invariably at the conclusion of his swing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sails into the air with his ball perched on it like a decoration . He has produced a bewildering variety of shots . His teammates still talk of a shot he made at the Red Run Country Club near Detroit which ticked off the very tip of his driver and sailed into the big plate-glass window of the club 's front room . The glass dropped out of its supports with a great roar . Karras stood around uneasily on the tee for a while and then he went up on the club porch and peered over the windowsill into the room . He could see his ball lying amidst the shards of glass . A waiter appeared at the far end of the room , balancing a breakfast tray . Karras called down to him . " Hey , is this room out of hounds ? " Ti always surprised me that a man possessed of such satanic , if controlled , fury on a football field could keep himself contained playing such awful golf . But the sole impression he gave , on the few occasions we played together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared into the deepest rough to flail away at an errant shot . Still , I could not have been more surprised last summer when the phone rang and it was Karras on the other end informing me that he was giving his own golf tournament in Flint , Michigan ? the Alex Karras Classic , it was called ? and would I drop everything to come out and play in it . " It 's your tournament , Alex ? " I asked . " A golf tournament ? " " That 's right , " he said . " It 's been put together in three weeks . It 's to benefit victims of cystic fibrosis . I do n't know what it 's going to do to my image . " Karras has a considerable reputation in football circles for being a black-hat bad-man sort of character , who says what he thinks in a refreshing , though appallingly candid , fashion ? by which in one instance in 1963 he incriminated himself into a year 's banishment from the National Football League for admitting he had placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can run away with the proceeds , " he said . " Well , are you corning ? " " But you know my game , " I said . " It 's almost as bad as yours . It 's awful . " " Well , I know , " said Karras . " But this tournament is different . No one 's going to play good golf . The whole tournament has been set up as a duffer 's revenge on the game . " We 've got these gags , " he explained , " that are going to bring good golfers right damn down to their knees . We 've got these rape ' machines hidden around the golf course . There 'll be these terrible noises coming out of the woods ? cars crashing , elephants screaming , things like that , all on tape and amplified to really make the golfers jump . We thought of mining the greens so they 'd blow up . Tiny Tim is going to rush out and carry on , and we 've got parachutists . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tournament . No kidding . ' He agreed . " " And you put all this together ? " " Pete Buterakos and me , " said Karras . " Holy smoke , " I said . - Pete Buterakos ? Well , I guess I 'd better arrange to come . " I had never met Buterakos , though I had heard the Detroit Lions talk about him . Football was his passion and he was around them often . He was a salesman who had made a considerable fortune selling cemetery plots ? though it was said he could have done just as well selling beanbags . His sales pitch combined quantities of zest and lunacy , coupled with self-confidence : his lectures on motivation were famous throughout the Midwest . I had once heard a tape of a speech he had given at the Lions training camp ? a wild burst of inspirational cajolery delivered with evangelical fervor and punctuated with the crash of the various props which were his particular trademark and were used to illustrate the points he raised in his talks . To show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hoist up a track hurdle , or set off an air hammer to illustrate that " life is full of windbags , " or fill the air with smoke bombs to indicate " a clogged mind . " On the tape of the inspirational talk I heard , there was a sudden deafening mash which I was told was a cherry bomb ( " life is full of abrupt changes " had been the cue for it t which he had rolled out behind him and which had in fact blown a big chunk of plaster out of the wall . The Detroit coaches had him around annually for these talks in the hope of perking up the team , and as Joe Schmidt , the head coach , once said , " Buterakos not only keeps you on the edge of your seat , but usually two or three feet above it . " - What a salesman , " Karras once told me about Buterakos . " He 'll do anything . " He went on to describe a speech on business administration he had heard Buterakos deliver before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for over an hour and tossed a variety of props into the audience , including live pigs ( " there are pigs in the business world " ) , rubber snakes ( " competition can turn good men into snakes " ) , and blood-soaked daggers ( " at the top there are people waiting to stab you in the back " ) . He climaxed his talk by bursting through a mock brick wall that had been set up on the stage . " What did he do that for ? " I asked . " To show you can overcome anything . " Karras said . For him there 's no such thing as an obstacle . He was wearing a Superman outfit . ' LL OF THIS WAS HIGH PRAISE coming from Karras , who himself was no slouch as a salesman . Joe Schmidt once mold me that Karras had : urned up at his door during the off-season with a Auk suitcase , and it turned out he was selling Bibles . " Well , Alex , I 've got a Bible back in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooling and the leather work on his Bible , " Karras said , displaying one . " It 's only fifteen bucks . You 'll be needing a reserve Bible , in : ase the other one gives out . " " We 're all right in the Bible department , " Schmidt said . " But these Bibles are different , " Karras said . Schmidt could sense he was getting desperate . " How do you mean they 're different ? " " Well , they 're German Bibles . Printed in Gernany . " " What 's so different about that ? " " Well , these German Bibles have got a different riding . " " A different ending ! " " That 's right , " Karras said . " They 've done some Soling around with the Resurrection and things ke that . But it 'll cost you fifteen bucks to find out 1st what . " " I damn near bought the thing , " Schmidt told Le . " There 's only one greater con man in the territory and that 's Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... ? " Most golf tournaments are a year in the making . Karras and Buterakos had been working on theirs for three weeks . Buterakos was the proprietor of a small golf course near Flint named Shady Acres . That was to be the locale of the tournament , which would , as I understood it , utilize the pro-am format of having one local athlete ( most of them from the Lions , but a few representatives from the Tigers , the Piston basketball organization , and the Detroit Red Wings , the hockey team ) playing in a foursome with Flint businessmen who would cough up $50 to benefit cystic fibrosis ) for the privilege . A number of outside celebrities were going to come in to play ? " a whole mess of astronauts , " Karras had told me . " And of course Tiny Tim . " " What 's Tiny Tim going to do , " I had asked . " Is he going to play golf ? " " I 'm going to parachute into the middle of the tournament , " Karras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and present inc with a bouquet . In the background the Ortonville band is going to play Tiptoe Through the Tulips . ' That 's what 's organized for Tiny Tim at the moment . We may have something else for hint to do . " There had been a number of meetings in Flint at which projects of this sort were planned . Buterakos was very much in evidence . At one meeting he gave a roar and threw a dead fish onto the table ? a big red snapper he had bought from the local fish market . - These proceedings are dead ! " he shouted . " You 've got to swim against the current to get anywhere . You 've got to have more zest , more pep . Now let 's get down to business . " Various duties had been assigned . Carl Brettschneider , the former Lion linebacker , was supposed to turn up at the tournament with a large selection of balloons to be passed out to the crowds by a local Flint clown named UpsieDaisy . " That 's all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Can you pull it off ? " " Yes , " said Brettschneider . " I 'm going to devote two nights to blowing them up . " When he turned up early on tournament day , Buterakos ran toward him and asked , " Where the hell are the balloons ? " " Well , " said Brettsehneider , " I 've got some good news for you and some bad news . The good news is that I 've decided I 'm going to play in the tournament . The bad news is that I have n't got the balloons . " " No balloons ! " Buterakos was furious . " What the hell 's Upsie-Daisy going to do without balloons to pass out ? " " I 've thought about that , " said Brettschneider . " Upsie-Daisy can shake hands with people . It 's more personal . What can you do with a balloon ? But to have your hand grabbed and then the big hello from Upsie-Daisy , well that 's something . " Buterakos was not mollified . He took a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistle . " Let 's move it , " he said . " Let 's goddamn move it . " B UTERAKOS ' WHISTLE WAS HIS PERSONAL trade-mark . He wore it on a white cord around his neck . I heard it for the first time at five-thirty the morning of the tournament . Arriving in Flint late the previous night , I had only three or four hours sleep in the motel before the whistle shrilled out in the corridor and a sharp rap sounded on the door . He was waiting for me ? a hig-chested elf , my first impression was , the whistle tucked in a corner of his mouth as he stared at me with peaceful brown eyes that seemed to belie w hat I 'd heard of his energy . I told him that I was n't expected to tee off until nine o'clock or so . I was awfully tired . No , he said . I had to come out to the golf course and see the " whole damn thing , unfold ? right from the beginning ? " as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the golf course . I stood and stomped my feet in the cold . There was no end of activity . Buterakos said it was worthwhile having a tournament just to see so many of his friends up at 6:00 A.M. He pointed out a man struggling with a wheelbarrow full of soft drinks . " That 's Dave Doherty . He 's got an undescended testicle ? one ball . Hey , Dave , " he shouted . " You 're really working your ball off . " Doherty shook his head wearily . " He takes a lot of kidding , " Buterakos said . He took me over to a table crowded with tape recorders . The man tinkering with them looked up and said , " Hey , Pete . You want to hear the lions ? " He flicked a switch which turned un a weird jangle of sound . " The tape 's on backwards . " the man said , " but that 's a fantastic sound . right Pete ? " Buterakos beamed at me . " The sound effects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man going by carrying a small cannon . Buterakos explained that it was to be hidden behind the first tee and shot off from time to time , just at the height of a competitor 's backswing . " Wait ' til you hear that thing , " Buterakos said . " It 'll make the golfers jump into the next county . " Alex Karras arrived . I never could look at him without a sense of surprise at his occupation : he had an enormous torso set on short stout legs , a behemoth fat-boy shape really , and yet on a football field he could move with astonishing speed ? " like a duck gone mad , " his teammates said of him . He wore heavy horn-rimmed glasses . He was dressed in a white mesh shirt and yellow golfing trousers . " Have the horses got here yet ? " he asked . He was assured that they had . A pony cart appeared around the corner of the clubhouse with two ponies in the traces . Beside the cart walked a man with a guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " Karras said to me . " He 's going to travel around the golf course in that little cart , with those ponies dragging him , and he 's going to stand up with this big Mexican grin and sing the Mexican Hat Dance . He 's going to belt out that song all day long , just that one song . He says to Inc . ' But I know a lot of songs . ' I say , ' No , the Mexican Hat Dance is the one we want . It 's a big golfing song . ' " " What did he say to that ? " I asked . " I tell him that the Mexican Hat Dance inspires golfers when they 're putting , " Karras said . " He does n't know what putting is . So I tell him , ' That 's when the guys are bending over the ball , trying to put it in the hole , and that 's when you should get in real close with those ponies and your cart so you can belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out in the parking lot , the competitors began arriving , getting their golf bags out of the car trunk and toting them across to the lawn in front of the clubhouse . I recognized some of the Lion players -- Nick Eddy and Mel Farr , who played on the offensive backfield , and Mike Lucci and Wayne Walker , two of the starting linebackers . The rest were primarily Flint residents , businessmen largely , two hundred of whom in thc course of three weeks had bought the $50 tickets . Many of them ? %tqlt down to the practice putting green and began working on their putting strokes . They seemed very serious . They wore the latest style in golfing attire , fancy golf shoes with the flaps over the laces , and tolling hats with the decal of their home course . Almost all of them had Arnold Palmer putting stances , the hunched shoulders and the locked knees . Their first impressions of the tournament must have been reasonably favorable : there were at least some concessions to tradition . A scoreboard . The caddies had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shirts ? which was a fine professional touch ? except the letters were stuck on with an adhesive that would n't hold . and one or two of the letters dropped off and left startling variations of the original name . Nick Eddy 's name in no time at all was reduced to ICK EDD - Mel Farr 's took on Mideastern simplicity : EL FA . The first indication of the tournament 's special quality was the Mexican guitarist 's serenade at the practice putting green . As Karras said later , he must have gone wild seeing all those golfers putting . " De da , de da , de da , de da-da-da-da-da-dah , " he sang , his foot lapping , an enormous grin , his fingers strumming hard . The golfers looked up . " Hey , can it , marl , " I heard one of them say . The foot kept tapping . The guitarist imparted an odd beseeching quality to the song , straining for a therapeutic effect . F THERE WAS ANY DOUBT as to the tournament 's I character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went off . Bill Munson , the Detroit Lion quarterback , was the first golfer off the tee . The amplifiers were suddenly turned on full tilt ? the sudden scream of tires , the rattle of gunfire ? and just at the top of his backswing someone behind the first tee pulled the lanyard of the cannon . The report was deafening . Munson leapt straight up in the air . his legs a-twangle , like a puppet gone awry . A cloud of white smoke drifted down the fairway . Bute. rakos ' whistle began shrilling . " All right , Munson let 's nut just stand around . Let 's move it out . " Visibly shaken , Munson addressed the hall am knocked out a drive , and then stood by as the thre ( Flint businessmen in hi= foursome teed off , their faces grim in concentration , as around them continued to crash the trumpet calls , the cymbal clashing , and the amplified sounds of toilets flushing . It was difficult to gauge the reaction of these players who had arrived expecting to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green when the cannon went off , they started up from their Arnold Palmer stances and looked at each other ; they stood around somewhat nervously . it seemed to me , resplendent in their togs , like egrets about to take flight ; but I did n't see anyone pack up and go home . When their time came , they walked up to drive off , and it was extraordinary to see them in that hurricane of sound on the first tee ? Buterakos intoning a windy and doubtless fake biography about them into a microphone ( " that sweet sweet guy on the first tee is Clint Jones of Flint , out on $10,000 bail his niece scraped together ... " ) , the amplifiers bellowing their startling variety of sounds , and the golfer him . self , poised over the ball , murmuring to himself to let his " left side come through " or whatever mental tip it was that he was using , and actually worrying not about a slice but about the cannon going off . Those who hit straight drives moved off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swamps ! " Buterakos shouted after them . " Look out for what 's going to be coming out of the swamps . " - What 's going to be coming out of the swamps ? " I asked him . " What swamps ? " he asked quietly . " No swamps on this Course . " My own foursome moved off an hour or so later without incident . But behind us , I turned to watch Errol Mann , the Lion place-kicker , mis-hit three drives in a row , one of which went four feet . I heard later that he pleaded with Buterakos to turn off the noise so he could concentrate , and Buterakos had said , All right , he would , and he then palmed him a trick golf ball which was specially prepared so that when Mann lashed at it , it smoked and popped sharply into two pieces . Storm clouds had been gathering most of the morning , and the first drops began to come down about one o'clock ? a heavy abrupt spatter in the trees off the fairway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the golf course . We were out of shot of the tape recorders . The Mexican Hat Dance man had materialized on two greens as we were putting out . With the rain , golf umbrellas were hastily put up , and under them nervous discussions went on about the lightning which was ripping around , making us start nervously . No one could agree as to the safest place to be . The rain began to come down so hard that the landscape went gray and the raindrops flickered off the fairways like aailstones . One of our group went out and stood in he middle of the fairway under an umbrella . His : kiddy stayed with us . We were under trees , such a arge patch of them that we felt ourselves safe ? hut le was insistent and said we were wrong and all lamn fools . We watched him through the hissing ; beets of rain . and we wondered if there was enough netal in our umbrellas to conduct electricity . Thelightning was awesome . Someone said that Karras and Buterakos had let their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of constant downpour we trudged back to the clubhouse . The golf course lay under stands of water , still being pocked by rain as the thunderheads moved on . Both competitors and onlookers had pushed inside the clubhouse . The noise was fierce . I could hear Buterakos ' whistle going as he desperately tried to keep things stirred up . I saw him trying to lead a group in some squat-kicks that I assumed were variations of a Greek dance . " Faster , faster ! " he was shouting at the band . " it 's a disaster , " someone was saying in my ear . " The band ought to he playing ' Nearer My God to Thee . ' " Across the way a heavyset man was shouting , " He 's not coming . Tiny Tim . He 's got halitosis . " " It 's laryngitis , " I was told . " The weather . He 's got to protect his vocal cords . That 's what his manager said . " Karras came by carrying a bouquet of blue flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Things were going too smooth , " he said , " I knew something like this was going to happen . It was so well planned ton . " There had been considerable speculation in the newspapers 1 Karras is always news in the Detroit area I about his actually jumping in by parachute ; he had had a knee operation the previous winter and the Detroit Lion management was reportedly up in arms . In fact Karras had no intention of jumping . His plan was to hide in a Port-O-Iohn lavatory structure and at the appropriate moment rush out with a parachute apparatus trailing behind him as if he had jumped , and with a big smile he would accept the flowers from Tiny Tim and there would be pictures and the next day the people in the area would look at ( heir papers and say , " Well , oId Alex is up to something ; what is it this time . " The rain stopped , and after a while the tournament started up again . We heard the Mexican Hat Dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ponies straining to pull the cart through the mud . There were distant explosions . My own golf was atrocious . The rain had soaked my golf pants and they had split completely down the seam without my being aware . A girl had come up and said , " Hey , are those good-luck pants or something ? " and I had reached back to find the back of the pants gone . My golf ' style changed abruptly . I developed a tendency to keep my back to Ihe trees and array from the crowds , and on the putting surface I changed my Arnold Palmer putting crouch to an upright telephone-pole-like stance , so straight that I could barely 1-each the ball with the putter . THEN WE GOT IN FROM THE ROI:ND , I went back V to the motel to change . I returned for the post-tournament golf dinner , which was held under a vast moldy tent , somewhat low-slung , and inadequately lighted , so that one had the sense of eating in a lantern-lit brewery cellar . The noise was deafening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tent and skirled around for a while , marching up and down between the long wooden tables , until someone gave a signal and they sat down at a table for dinner , the instruments propped up on the benches beside them . Karras had urged me to come to the golf dinner . He said it would be " different . " The prizes were not what I would expect . In fact , I would not recognize the usual pro-am dinner at all ? with its familiar climax of applause and the day 's low-ball team sauntering up to the awards table to receive silver bowls and sets of matched irons . " No sir , " said Karras . An auction preceded the award-giving , which Karras presided over , shouting above the noise . The Flint merchants had donated a number of items , any one of which would have tested the mettle of the most expert of auctioneers . Among other things , there were ten Big Boy flashlights to he got rid of ; ten stencil kits ; five domino sets ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do I hear for these sox ? " Karras would shout , holding them aloft . " Do I hear a dollar for these sox ? They run from size ten to thirty-three . Size thirty-three will cover your entire body ! " The last item was a small desk globe . Karras tried to sell it to the man with one testicle . " Dave , you 'll want this thing around the house , " Karras called tenderly . The awards ceremony followed . Karras was relieved by Sonny Eliot , the Detroit TV weather caster . Eliot is an extraordinary phenomenon in the Detroit area ? a small lively man who has added such a dimension of entertainment with his quicksilver approach to reporting the weather , of all things , that he is a considerable hometown celebrity , right up there with Gordie Howe , the hockey player , and Al Kaline , from the Tigers , and six blocks ahead of the mayor . Detroit people set alarm clocks to he sure they do n't miss Sonny Eliot 's program which concludes the eleven o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can bring to a weather front bearing down on the Peninsula area . Even Sonny Eliot seemed somewhat shaken by his duties . He took over the microphone and held it as if he expected it to explode . Karras and Buterakos stood behind him and prompted him from time to time . The chief awards were for the winning foursome . All clay long there had been rumors that each member of the low-ball team was going to win a car . Flint , after all , is a big automobile town with many General Motors divisions , particularly Chevrolet , and a number of people , lining up birdie putts , doubtless sparked their concentration by telling themselves a car could be in the offing . " And now the grand moment ! " Sonny Eliot shouted . A silence descended . A group near the Mexican Hat Dance man turned around and tried to get him quieted down . " Each member of the winning foursome ? " Eliot shouted , and he read off their names " ? receives an auto-mo-bile incredulous cries and we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One of the winners was sitting down the table from me and his eyes were bright with excitement . He had bought a Big Boy flashlight set during the auction and he began banging it on the table . " Holy Christ ! " he shouted . Eliot was calling directions to a group of people down at one end of the tent . The flaps were hauled back and we stood up from our benches and craned to sec in the semi-darkness what turned out to be four total wrecks hauled in from a junkyard , victims of head-on collisions , wheelless , just jumbles of blue metal , and Sonny Eliot began shouting , " All right , you winners , you 'll find the keys above the sun visor . Gentlemen , start your engines and let 's get those damn things out of there . " The winner with the Big Boy flashlight began shaking his head . I felt a twinge of sorrow . There must have been some part of him which felt that he really was going to get a car , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the front seat and reach for the keys .... FT E R THE CEREMONY I WANDERED over and spoke to Karras . He had a cigar stuck dead center in his mouth . He removed it and said that he and Buterakos were already jotting down ideas for the 1971 Karras Classic . " It 's going to be bigger and louder , " he said . Buterakos came by . " We 're talking about the ' 71 Karras Classic , " I said . " We 're going to shoot Alex out of a cannon , " Buterakos said . " Did he tell you about the trumpeters in the trees ? " " Oh yeah , " said Karras . " There 're going to be these trumpeters in the trees . A lot of them . You 'll see them sitting up there , and they 'll blow a lot of cavalry charges . " " What about the animals , " Buterakos said . " Tell him about the animals . " " Yeah , " said Karras . " These animals are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herds of them . We 'll ship them in secretly at night and get these kids to drive them out during the tournament . Strange animals too , like llamas ; these Flint golfers 'll look up from their shot and they 'll say , What the hell 's that ? ' " " And yaks , " Buterakos said . " The bushes part and these yaks stream out . " Is there an animal called a ginook ? " Karras asked abruptly . ginook ? Well , I do n't think so , " I said . " Well , there ought to be , " Karras said . His eyes were fixed . " The hushes part and these ginooks rush out ? a whole mess of them . " Then , " Karras went on . " we 're going to have these mysterious professionals playing with some of the foursomes . We 'll tell these Flint businessmen that they are lucky . ' You may not have drawn Al Kaline for your celebrity , ' we 'll tell them , ' but fil you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn Bill Tank . You 're going to break the course record . ' " ' Bill who ? ' they ask . " ' Why , Bill Tank . The pro . He 's out of San Fernando Country Club . Came in third in the Western Open one year . ' " So these Flint guys get all excited , " Karras continued , " and they get out early on the course to practice their putting . They bet on themselves . Then , to meet them on the first tee , we get this seedy cat in old britches and he says , ' Tank 's the name . I 'm your pro partner , ' and he steps up and hits the ball about thirty-two feet . He drinks a lot . this guy , out of a stone jug , and on the fourth hole he topples into a sand trap and they ca n't get him out of there . He 's out cold . " " How is the rest of Bill ' tank 's foursome going to take this ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is you keep them off balance so they do n't know if - they 're being taken for a ride or maybe just unlucky . You ride out to see them in a golf cart , somewhere on the back nine , all excited , and you say , Gee , for God 's sake , where 's Bill Tank ? You guys must be ripping the course apart . ' " They give you one of these : the cold look . Then they say that Tank 's back in some goddamn sand trap , out colder than ice . ' What a damn shame . ' you say , ' what a real damn shame you got him on one of his bad days . ' " " Alex , " said Buterakos , " I 'm going to stir up the natives . " He gave a blast on his whistle . " Get the drinking under way ! " he shouted . He turned as he walked off : " You tell him about the midget ? " " Yeah , the midget , " said Alex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a great pro playing with them . this guy called Jim ' Dynamite ' Grogan , and they get to the first tee and they say , ' Well , where 's Grogan ? ' all excited , and the midget steps up and he says ' I 'm Grogan . ' He 's real nattily dressed in a golf outfit , very correct , and he 's got this great hulking caddy , a real monster of a guy , who carries the midget 's golf bag tucked under one arm . the way you carry a telescope . " The midget steps up to tee oil He 's got this British ball he 's playing with , which is a little smaller than the American , and after he 's put it down on the tee , he squints out from under this tiny little golf hat and he says in that little helium voice that midgets have . ' Hey , how long is this course ? ' Well , they tell him it 's about six thousand yards . ' Six thousand yards ? ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midget regularly plays : here par-three courses , with the Inure difficult holes narked up to fours and fives , and he gets around in what scratch players get around a regular coursenaybe seventy , seventy-two . He 's never played a egular course . So he tells these Flint businessmen , You guys , this is quite an experience for me . This s some privilege , playing a regular course . ' " So . he steps up to the ball and he 's got this real erfect grooved swing , sweet as anything . except is arc of it is n't more than three or four feet . The ball goes out , click , real straight for fifty yards down the center of the fairway . The midget watches it go and he 's real proud . The Flint businessmen hear him say to himself , ' Oh you sweetheart . You really sweethearted that one . ' " " Well , Alex , " I asked , " how do the Flint businessmen take this ? " " You blame the PGA , " Karras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PGA recommended this guy and how are you going to tell from the guy 's name , which is Jim ' Dynamite ' Grogan , that he measures in at a shade over three feet tall ? " " And the caddies , " I asked . " I suppose you 'll have a number of them planted to do mischief . " " The caddies ! " Karras began to laugh , his hand flying up to his mouth . " Oh my , " he said . " The caddies . Oh Christ . We 'll get these real wise-guy caddies , these old Scottish people , old and wrinkled , and with these thin mean voices , so that you think they 're terribly old women , one hundred and fifty years old , but they ' know the course . ' And they give these Flint guys this weird advice ? like they show the guy an angle off the tee facing a forest that goes all the way to the Canadian border , and they say , Clear that tree and you 're home free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' It 's the shot , I 'm telling you . Hit it right and you drop right down for a wee easy chip . I 've been working this course for sixty years , ' etcetera , etcetera .
