 | It 's no longer a remote threat , but a clear and present danger . It no longer preys on the weak and the wayward , but on you and me . It reaches into our homes and it even touches our children . For the fact is that " it " ? Organized Crime ( no matter by what name you call it ) ? has come out in the open . Crime has become Big Business in the United States ? perhaps the biggest . ( A crime-lord  | once remarked casually , " We 're bigger than U.S. Steel . " ) Its operations are no longer confined to gambling , hijacking , prostitution and loan-sharking . Now gangsters have moved into legitimate businesses ? and by those take-overs moved into private homes across America . The businesses ? Everything from diaper services and dress boutiques to garbage-hauling and meat-packing plants . @# Consider these examples : ? A company that had long produced a highquality brand of packaged meats was taken over by a new owner , and shortly thereafter contaminated ingredients began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients ? mainly the carcasses of diseased animals ? were supplied by a company owned by a loan shark associated with organized crime . ? A little-known and inferior detergent suddenly appeared on the shelves of a number of supermarkets ? and marked at a hefty price . Stores that refused to stock the detergent were either burned out , or their managers suffered mysterious , sometimes fatal " accidents . " Investigation revealed that the company pushing the product was owned by two brothers ? both Mafia bigwigs in the East . ? The owner of a nationally known dress company found that his shipments were being hijacked enroute to stores . He saw his business crumbling , until he agreed to use a particular ? and costly ? trucking service . It happened to be owned by a relative of a Mafia leader . Result ? The price tags on the manufacturer 's line of clothes soon showed a several-dollar increase . Isolated cases ? Unfortunately , no . All across the country people are unwittingly paying the price for organized crime . So , while few of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are . The Mob Moves in on Meat Foods contaminated by the environment are one problem ? but imagine the horrors of foods intentionally contaminated by hoodlums . This happened not too long ago in New York , when gangsters took over the Merkel Meat Company , which for years had had a spotless reputation . After the Merkel family sold out to a group headed by a man named Norman Lokietz , he began to peddle , under the Merkel name , frankfurters and other ground-meat products made from ingredients never intended for human consumption . More concerned with profit than quality , Lokietz sought his own dubious sources of ingredients . Before long he was buying the carcasses of cows , horses  | and sheep that had died or became ill from various diseases . This tainted meat , intended to be used only as feed for minks being raised for their fur , was purchased by a New York meat processor , the head of which was then Charles Anselmo . He was identified by lawenforcement agencies as a loan shark who had direct connections with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who turned it into Merkel frankfurters . When law-enforcement agents traced the meat to Merkel 's new owner , they discovered that Lokietz was working in collusion with a group of inspectors from the Department of Agriculture . Lokietz had " convinced " the inspectors to certify that the frankfurters met proper standards . These deplorable practices were exposed by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Frank Hogan and by the New York State Commission of Investigation at public hearings in 1969 . Gangsters , it was shown , had been infiltrating the meat industry since World War II , when they discovered there was profit to be made in black market meats and stolen ration stamps . The commission further pointed out that some companies make a point of hire ing gangsters ? many a whom have connections with labor unions ? in the hopes of buying labor peace , But , the commission emphasized , what such companies really wind up buying is trouble for themselves and for their customers , For example , the commission 's hearings disclosed what happened a few years ago when a meat company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a salesman . An important member of the Thomas Luchese Mafia " family , " Johnny Dio had very impressive connections , including solid ties to powerful people in labor unions , It was n't long before salesman Dio became the chief force in the company he worked for- and when that happened the quality of its products plummeted . What kind of meat was Johnny Dio 's company selling ? According to a route salesman for the company , who delivered the meat to the supermarkets , it was " light in color , sometimes green and at all times sweaty . " And while it is standard procedure for a route salesman to take back meat the supermarkets are not satisfied with , Johnny Dio 's company ordered its men to accept no returns at all . The forced sale of this meat , according to one route salesman , was " an atrocity " perpetrated on customers . The commission 's report on this case concluded : " The ultimate loser here , as always , was the consumer , for the policy of no returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass on the green , sweaty ' meat to the housewife . " The Detergent that Started a " War : " How far would you expect the manager of your supermarket to go to protect you and other customers against intimidation by gangsters ? In his battle to keep inferior products off his shelves , you 'd hardly expect him to have to give his life . Some time ago , Jerry Catena , a leading New Jersey Mafia figure , along with his brother , Gene , went into the detergent business . Their first step was to acquire rights , from the manufacturer of a little-known brand of detergent , to sell the product to retailers in the New Jersey area . The Catena brothers were well organized : they already had a company called " Best Sales Co. of Newark , " which was ready to push the new product into supermarkets . Their " salesmen " ? The 600 members of Jerry 's gang , with an assist from certain members of labor unions . The detergent proved to be a fast mover . And no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' - union contacts had " introduced " the product in the supermarkets with the significant information that it was being sold by " particular friends of ours . " Many store managers quickly took the hint and ordered an ample supply of the stuff ,  | which they priced , as directed , at 70 cents a box . Then efforts were made to " persuade " the A &P; chain to stock the detergent , and perhaps even to give it a special push over the established brands . All went well until the A &P; tested the product and found it substandard . At this point the chain refused to stock it at all . This refusal angered Gene Catena to the point where he vowed to " knock A &P's; brains out . " The pattern of retaliation soon took shape . First , a fire bomb burned a Yonkers , N.Y. , A &P; to the ground . A month later , an A &P; store in Peekskill , N.Y. , was hit by a Molotov cocktail . Two months after that , a Manhattan A &P; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bronx . Understandably concerned and frightened , executives of the A &P; nevertheless saw no connection between the fires and the detergent turn-down . But soon less subtle methods of intimidation faced them , In January , 1965 , the manager of a Brooklyn A &P; was driving home from his store when a tire mysteriously went flat . When he got out to change it , four men pulled up alongside his car and shot him to death . Two weeks later , an A &P; manager from Elmont , N.Y. , was shot dead in his driveway . And two months after that , a fire bomb demolished another A &P; store in the Bronx . Frantic A &P; officials turned to the Federal government for help with what had clearly turned into a " war . " Soon government informants working secretly in the underworld confirmed that the long line of murders and burnings did indeed stem from A &P's; rejection of the detergent . However , because the informants could not be exposed , no one was indicted . The campaign of terror did end abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for questioning , but no one was ever punished for the two murders and the destruction by fire of five supermarkets . The Clothes that Wore Hidden Costs Gangsters have found the business of trucking products from wholesaler to retailer a highly profitable one , After all , gangland trucking firms have one great advantage over legitimate ones : their trucks are not likely to be hijacked . But crime-backed truckers are expensive , and whenever a manufacturer signs up with one you can be certain that the hike will ultimately be passed on to you in the form of higher prices . For example , several years ago customers ended up footing the bill when the manufacturer of a nationally known line of medium-priced dresses and sportswear began having troubles shipping his clothes across the country . The troubles had started with a visit from the late Thomas ( " Three Fingers " Brown ; Luchese , then the leader of one of the major Mafia families in the nation . The manufacturer , Luchese suggested , should avail himself of a particular trucking firm ? which happened to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused , Luchese merely smiled and walked out of the office . A few days later the first of a series of trucks carrying the garment-maker 's products was hijacked . Others had tires slashed or motors damaged to the point where delays in deliveries became common . Though at first he stood firm , the manufacturer could not continue indefinitely to ignore complaints from retail outlets about non-deliveries and late deliveries . Eventually , with his whole business in jeopardy , he gave in and switched to the Luchesebacked trucking firm . At that point his shipping troubles suddenly stopped . but , just as suddenly his trucking costs rose a whopping ten percent . Not surprisingly , women across the country soon found his line of dresses and sportswear noticeably more expensive . Banana Boats ? and Trucks Sometimes even the vague threat of gangland connections may be enough  | to frighten retailers into using gangland trucking services . And in addition to higher prices , this can result in another affront to customers : waste , in the form of damaged goods , especially when edibles are involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bananas were used to demonstrate this point . When major banana importers bring the fruit into the United States , the Journal explained , the ships steam up to the docks and the fruit is sold directly to middlemen , called " jobbers . " The jobbers store the fruit until it is ripe and then sell it to retail stores . Eventually , to move the massive bunches of bananas to fruit stores and supermarkets , trucks are hired . Whenever the ships of three major banana importers tie up at Port Newark , N.J. , and at Pier 13 on New York 's East River , the jobbers are on hand to buy . They already know whom they will hire to haul their purchases : the Ross Trucking Company . There is no question about that , because if a jobber hires someone else the three banana importers will not sell him bananas . ( The fourth and largest major banana importer in the country , United Fruit Company , uses other docks and allows competing trucking companies to unload its ships . ) No one knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importers , but many point out that it has to do with the fact that the company 's highest paid employee is connected with the Mafia . According to the executive director of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor , Ross Trucking charges " exorbitant rates " and its trucks are n't insulated to protect the fruit . Though most of the jobbers are not happy about the situation , they do n't want to buck it either . When asked about Ross Trucking , one jobber nervously told The Wall Street Journal , " Leave me out . This is strictly a cement overcoat situation . " Another said , " Look , I do n't question the system . " But a third jobber complained , " It costs me 221/2 cents a box of bananas if Ross delivers . I could save 10 cents a box by sending my own truck down to the dock . But no , I 'm forced to use Ross . " Remember , if the jobber has to pay more , and if bananas are damaged in transit , both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Destroyers Move into Your Town Perhaps the most insidious kind of criminal infiltration into legitimate business occurs when gangster-backed companies finagle city contracts to build schools and highways or to provide the city with trucks and automobiles . Sooner or later the citizens of the town wake up to find that they 're stuck with dangerously unsound buildings or highways or vehicles ? and are paying outrageously high costs for them at that . Consider what happened a few years ago , in Mount Vernon , N.Y. , a residential community of 73,000 people . The thing that attracted organized crime to Mount Vernon was , of all things , its garbage ? and over $200,000 that was paid annually to have it hauled away . The proof of who was getting this sizable fee became clear two years ago , when several problems in the city 's garbage collection service came to light . For one thing , a number of homeowners complained that their refuse frequently was not collected . For another , the mayor of the town suspected that , on occasion , truckloads of garbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and payment was based on the number of pounds hauled away . Inquiries led to the discovery that the man whose company had been awarded the contract to haul Mount Vernon 's garbage had , several years before ? and without the city 's permission ? sold his equipment and turned  | over the operation to a company called the Columbus Lease Corporation of Mount Vernon . It was also disclosed that the Columbus Lease Corporation was run by Joseph Gambino , the 39-year-old cousin of aging Mafia Chieftain Carlo Gambino and , according to Federal officials , a lieutenant in Carlo 's Mafia family . Eventually Mount Vernon 's Common Council voted to abandon the private-contract arrangement and have the garbage hauled by city employees . You may think that only communities like Mount Vernon , those close to big cities with high crime rates , are susceptible to the Mob . If so , you are wrong . No community is as removed from big cities or big-city pressures as Muskogee , Okla. , yet the underworld apparently had no trouble reaching it . Muskogee , a town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song as the model city of the " silent majority , " a place where drugs , hippies and draft-card burnings are unknown . But recently in Muskogee the local police department has been torn by dissensions which have been called the work of " an underworld element " ; several city councilmen have been threatened , and one councilman 's place of business was burned . Last year Muskogee got a new city manager , Leonard Briley , and a new young police chief , George Kennedy . Two previous police chiefs had resigned ? one after his automobile was bombed and the other after his home had been fired upon . When Chief Kennedy began to put his department in order , some of the 52 policemen in his command rebelled against the discipline he insisted upon . Subsequently , with the support of the new city manager , Kennedy dismissed or suspended nine policemen . By last October , wives of policemen began picketing City Hall to demand the ouster of Kennedy and Briley . By November , Briley indicated that there was evidence that " an underworld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police department . The next month he said his suspicions were confirmed : On December 10 , Chief Kennedy announced that he had learned of a plot by underworld elements and city policemen to burn the music store of a city councilman . On the thirtieth of that month he dismissed three more policemen , and four days later the councilman 's music store was burned . The fire chief said the $100,000 fire had been caused by arson . A few minutes before the flames enveloped the store , a police car had been seen speeding away . All this was in Muskogee , Okla. ! Drugs and Pornography ? Old Standbys Of all the dangers we face from organized crime , perhaps none are more terrifying than those which may victimize our children . And two of organized crime 's best-selling commodities ? narcotics and pornography ? prey on youngsters wherever they live , in whatever circumstances and whatever their class or color . Though narcotics is a gold mine for the Mob , the drug peddler handing out free samples near your son 's or daughter 's school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that highrisk job is being left to small-time criminals and addicts ? people who are desperate for a quick dollar and willing to run the risk of arrest . But the network that supplies the pusher his hard drugs is the monopoly of organized crime . It is through this network 's efforts ( and free samples ) that the drug problem now has reached down from college campuses into high schools , junior highs and even upper elementary grades . No school , however exclusive , is immune to drug-related problems . In one junior high school in San Francisco , seventh graders were discovered trading barbiturates in their homerooms , Even at New York 's select Dalton school , where tuition is $2,000 a year , four teen-age students were placed on probation for using marijuana ( not a " hard " drug , but evidence that a pusher is nearby ) . A Berkeley psychologist estimated that by the twelfth grade , 14 percent of the students in Berkeley 's public schools had tried LSD or its equivalent , and that some were using it as early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Percy Pilon , a contractor , and his wife innocently went out to dinner one night last November . Meantime , their 18-year-old son , a good student and a popular boy , was busy writing a description of his seven-month battle with drugs and his despair at being " hooked . " His writing done , he killed himself with a shotgun . In his account , directed at other young people , he wrote : " Learn from my mistakes . I do n't want anyone to go through the hell I went through and am still going through . These friends of yours will offer stuff free , then start making you pay for it . Then they sell you harder stuff at discount prices , then boost the prices up when they got you hooked . Remember the same person or friend who has grass will also be able to push heroin to you , and for what ? To make money for himself while he destroys you . People who push are the ones who want to destroy you , and if you give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know was that his tragedy began with drugs made available by organized crime . While the Mob has long dealt in narcotics , it has only recently moved into the profitable business of selling pornography to children . Many of the lewd materials available to youngsters under-the-counter in book and magazine stores , or advertised through the mails , are published and distributed by companies with underworld connections . Late last year the New York State Commission of Investigation charged that one of these companies is Star Distributors Limited . When it started out . the firm was floundering and so low on funds that its suppliers insisted it pay cash for all purchases . Then Robert Di Bernardo joined the company as a vice-president , and suddenly , according to the commission , its fortunes skyrocketed . Today it is a major distributor of sex materials both in the United States and abroad . During its investigation the commission disclosed that Di Bernardo has been closely connected with the Mafia family of Simon de Cavalcante . The commission also charged that a second major distributor of sex materials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mafia gambler and loan shark named Joseph Bronchini . Two investigators testified that , since racketeers had infiltrated the sex-materials business , the materials ( including peep shows ) had become more pornographic and more technically polished . " The evidence is quite clear , " says Paul Curran , chairman of the commission , " that racketeers have come into some measure of control of such ke ' . businesses as the production of lowgrade-sex pocket books and magazines . stag films , peep-show machines , and as operators of many bookstores ' that art the main outlet for this trash . " The Target ? and the Weapons at Your Disposal There is more to organized crime than just the Mafia . The nationwide crime syndicate is composed of numerous gangs from different parts of the country and a variety of ethnic backgrounds Originally these gangs operated on their own and in their own territory . There was the Mayfield Road Mob in Cleveland , the Purple Gang in Detroit , the Bugs and Meyer Gang in New York , and many more . The competition among them often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day Massacre in Chicago , which was the climax of a war between an Irish gang led by Bugs Moran and a Mafia group led by Al Capone . With the advent of Prohibition , how - ever , the various gangs discovered that cooperation was essential if they were to profit from the import , manufacture and distribution of bootleg liquor throughout the country . Working together paid off handsomely and the gangsters suddenly found themselves with tremendous amounts of money to use in yet other criminal ventures . Nor were gang leaders confined to any one ethnic group . The bosses were famous criminals of various backgrounds : Italians , such as Lucky Luciano ; Anglo-Saxons , such as Owney ( The Killer ) Madden ; Irishmen , such as " Big Bill " Dwyer ; and Jews , such as Meyer Lansky and Louis ( Lepke ) Buchalter . Two of the most important men in this group were Luciano and Lansky . Before he was deported to Italy in  | 1946 , Luciano was the major power in organizing and solidifying the Italian gangs into a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as a killer for hire , proved to have a brilliant and original business mind and led the confederation of gangs into such untapped and profitable enterprises as gambling , banking , manufacturing and other legitimate businesses . He set up the complicated network that smuggles money from the rackets out of the country into numbered Swiss bank accounts and then eventually brings it back into the country as " laundered " money to be invested in a variety of legitimate businesses . Today the gangs which make up organized crime still operate local rackets independently , but when it comes to national projects they are always ready to cooperate with each other . When Las Vegas was first opened up to legal gambling , for example , almost every gang in the country invested money in hotels and casinos there . And when the leader of a gang in New Orleans wants to force a company based in Toledo to use his trucking company , he does n't need to send one of his men to Toledo to talk to the company 's executives . He simply gets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle the " arrangements . " Aware of the scope and power of organized crime and the extent of its infiltration into legitimate business , the lone American citizen can feel woefully helpless . What can we do to protect ourselves , our families and our communities from the ever-expanding menace of the Mob ? The key to what can be done was supplied by Sam Tucker , a leading gangster from Cleveland . " We do n't go where we 're not wanted , " Tucker once said . Organized crime can survive where law-enforcement agencies are ineffective , where public officials are unconcerned or weak , and where citizens are indifferent or afraid . Our first job then , is to help create a climate that is hostile to organized crime and a community that is aware of its menace . Probably the best recommendations for accomplishing that are contained in the report of President Johnson 's Crime Commission . Among its recommendations are the following : ? That police departments in every major city should have a special in-telligence unit devoted solely to ferreting out organized criminal activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city should have enough men assigned full time to organized crime . ? That citizens and business groups should organize permanent citizens ' crime commissions to combat organized crime . ? That all newspapers in major metropolitan areas where organized crime exists should designate a highly competent reporter for full-time work and writing concerning organized crime , the corruption caused by it and government efforts to control it . Newspapers in smaller communities should fulfill their responsibility to inform the public of the nature and consequence of these conditions . Individually or in groups , you and your neighbors can find out from your police chiefs , local prosecutors , local newspapers and local business and civic groups how far they have gone in implementing these recommendations . You can let your community leaders know that you are concerned about the growing power of organized crime and are prepared to demand and support constructive efforts to fight it . Just how much can be accomplished is dramatically illustrated by developments in recent years in New York and New Jersey . New York has the highest concentration of Mafia hoodlums in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such power that they operated for years with little fear of the law . Then , in 1961 , Robert Morgenthau was named U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York . He put together a crack staff of young , aggressive prosecutors . In the nine years he was in office , 150 Mafia members , including some top bosses , were indicted and convicted in the Southern District and the hold of the Mafia on the area was greatly weakened . More recently , Frederick B. Lacey , the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey , launched a campaign against the Mafia in that crime-ridden state that saw the conviction of half a dozen top Mafia leaders and a number of prominent politicians who had allowed themselves to be corrupted . We all have a right to expect such effectiveness from law-enforcement agencies and leaders in our own communities . Organized crime leaders will begin to wither away only when private citizens and public officials stand together against them .                    @
