<P> There will , it was made plain last week , always be an England , an England where a gentleman should always know the right thing to do-even when he is a minister of the Crown and lolling naked on a bed with a prostitute or two . Last week one of the Queen 's Lords of Appeal , Lord Diplock , made a distinction between right and wrong with a whore exquisitely clear in his report on the national-security aspects of Britain 's latest sex scandal . <P> In May , two ministers of the Conservative government-Earl Jellicoe , Tory Leader in the House of Lords , and Lord Lambton , parliamentary Under Secretary of Defense for the Royal Air Force-resigned after it was disclosed that they had been patronizing London call girls . In the report of his investigation of this matter , Lord Diplock very carefully weighed each minister 's indiscretion on different-oddly different - scales . Jellicoe , it was pointed out , used only " escort agencies " advertised in the London papers , dealt with the girls under an assumed name and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work " as a minister . Moreover , said Diplock , with a fine legal eye for delicate distinctions , Jellicoe took the prostitutes home to the privacy of his own bedroom . " He entertained them to a meal , and any sexual intercourse took place late in the evening and at his own flat and never elsewhere . " <P> On Film . As for Lord Lambton , that was a more serious case . According to Diplock , Lambton indiscreetly and unwisely paid for his whoring with checks signed in his own name and went openly to a prostitute 's apartment , where he was filmed " naked on a bed with Norma Levy and another girl , both also naked . " Worse yet , Lambton combined pot with his popsies . Marijuana or cannabis-for those readers of the report who might never have heard of it-was described as " a soft drug which produces changes in mood and perception and gives a feeling of irresponsibility . " Diplock added that there was " photograph ic evidence , " involving Lambton , " of sexual practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is much wrong with normal sex , Diplock ruled magisterially , even for men in high places . " If all that is involved is ordinary sexual inter course with prostitutes , this is no crim inal offense . " The security risk seemed relatively minor . Declared Diplock : " Such indiscretions are more likely to occur in the kind of conversation that takes place at cocktail parties or around a dinner table than in what might be said to a prostitute in bed . " In Lambton 's case , whatever security risk there was existed not so much in bed but behind the walls , where cameras and tape machines were recording instant history . Here was the danger that blackmail material might find its way into the hands of foreign intelligence agents . <P> Diplock 's lesson , then , is clear to any government official who might wish to savor the sexual charms of a professional : if she ( or he ) asks , " Your place or mine ? " the proper reply is " mine . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
