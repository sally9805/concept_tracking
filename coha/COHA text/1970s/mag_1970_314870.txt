For some time , the celebrated author Alexander Solzhenitsyn has been under attack in the Soviet Union . <P> He has been expelled from the Soviet Writers ' Union and threatened with exile from his country . The official press regularly denounces him ; only last week the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya , in a poem that did not name Solzhenitsyn but was plainly aimed at him , charged that he " long ago defected with his soul . " <P> Uneasy as his situation may be at home , Solzhenitsyn is also concerned by a growing menace to his freedom from abroad . Several of his manuscripts have come into the hands of American and European publishers . At least one of the manuscripts could only have been obtained and passed on by the KGB , the Soviet secret police . None were released by Solzhenitsyn , who is categorically opposed to publication of his work in the West . He has already been accused of sending his banned writings abroad to be exploited by Russia 's enemies , and of allowing his royalties to go " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen could be imprisoned at hard labor for seven years-Solzhenitsyn has already served eight years in Stalinist prisons and concentration camps . <P> Solzhenitsyn is trying to combat the threats to him on two fronts . He has pressed Soviet authorities for an answer to the question " Why do you refuse to publish me in Russia ? " To prevent unauthorized publication of his works in the West , he has repeatedly and vainly asked the Soviet Writers ' Union to protect his author 's rights . Now that he has been expelled from the union , Solzhenitsyn has engaged a Swiss lawyer , Fritz Heeb , to balk what he regards as " the exploitation and distortion " of his work by publishers in the West . In Zurich last week , Heeb told TIME : " Solzhenitsyn has no intention of becoming the easy prey of unscrupulous publishers . He intends to take legal action , if necessary , to prevent the misuse of his name and the unauthorized publication of his work . " Heeb described the charge that Solzhcnitsyn 's royalties have gone to " anti-Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won fame in 1962 when Nikita Khrushchev authorized the publication in Russia of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich , a chilling indictment of Stalin-era labor camps . In 1966 , however , Solzhenitsyn 's writings were banned . Manuscripts that Solzhenitsyn had previously submitted to Soviet publishers began circulating from hand to hand in Russia . The KGB seized others from the writer . As a result , a number of novels , stories , poems and plays have been peddled to Western publishers by shadowy figures claiming to be " representatives " of the author . Sometimes the items for sale were accompanied by purported authorizations . Some of the manuscripts that were circulating privately were brought out of the country by travelers . The secret police planted others with publishers in an attempt to manufacture a criminal case against Solzhenitsyn under the Soviet law that forbids an author to disseminate " anti-Soviet literature . " Since 1968 , Cancer Ward and other works forbidden in Russia have become bestsellers in the West despite Solzhenitsyn 's vehement public protests against their publication .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
