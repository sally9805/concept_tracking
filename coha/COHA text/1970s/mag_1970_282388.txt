As a secretary , Karen Liable could type " four-barrel carburetor , " but she certainly did not know what it did or even looked like . For precisely that reason , she was picked to leave her desk at the Ford Motor Co. last week , don coveralls , and approach a waiting Pinto , the 2,000-lb. subcompact that Ford will put on sale Sept. 11 . Her mission : to perform many of the adjustments described in the owner 's manual , The Happy Pinto - and How to Keep It That Way . If Karen failed , Ford officials said , the manual would be deemed a failure , and would have to be rewritten in simpler language . As it turned out , Karen did well ; she removed the air cleaner , changed the grille , cleaned the spark plugs . <P> Ford 's fix-it-yourself approach reflects an effort by Detroit to turn out cars that can be adjusted easily by the ordinary driver . The trend began with the introduction of two small , easily fixable models-Ford 's Maverick and American Motors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is continuing . On Sept. 10 , General Motors will introduce its subcompact , the Vega , and executives are boasting about how easy it is to repair . Says one : " Just five screws hold Vega 's grille in place . It can be removed in less than ten minutes without taking off the bumper . All that 's necessary to remove the bumper is to loosen six bolts . " <P> Swing to Simplicity . By making such simple , basic machines , the automakers have decided to try to beat Volkswagen , Toyota and Fiat at their own game . The Vega has only 1,231 parts , the Pinto 1,600 . By comparison , a standard two-door Impala has 3,500 parts and a Lincoln Continental 9,000 . Partly because big U.S. cars are so full of complicated tubes , wiring and equipment , which mechanics call " plumbing and spaghetti , " even easy repair jobs can cost great amounts of money . Mechanics ' hourly pay has increased from about $3.78 in 1966 to $5 today . This autumn Ford will sell sets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spare parts for the Pinto . The company estimates that in only a few minutes a Pinto driver can replace the grille for $10 , the rear lights for $5.25 and all fuses and lightbulbs for $4 . <P> To promote the Pinto , Ford is also offering buyers a simple , key-shaped tool that it claims serves 27 purposes , from measuring the gap between electrodes on a spark plug to stripping wire and turning regular and Phillips screws . Not to be outdone , G.M. suggests that , with its illustrated and simplified manual , the Vega owner will need only a few tools : wrench , screwdriver , coat hanger , garden hose and-to replace transmission and rear-axle fluids-a turkey baster.
