EL COCA-COLA GRANDE <P> A MUSICAL REVUE <P> Conceived by RON HOUSE and DIZ WHITE <P> Playgoers in a silly mood will probably find this daffy production highly diverting . Others will not . British and European audiences made El Coca-Cola Grande something of a cult , and if there is anything that off-Broadway loves , it is a cult ; the show will doubtless have its U.S. devotees . <P> The format is that of a musical revue . Most of it is sung or spoken in pidgin Spanish , some in pidgin French and German , and none in English . Much of the show is mimed and the real language is basic zany . <P> Before the performance begins , Seor Don Pepe Hernandez , a third-rate impresario who bills himself as " el compere extraordinario " has advertised in the local press of Trujillo , Honduras , that he has assembled a nightclub act of internationally famous cabaret stars . They include Seor Blind Joe Jackson ( el blues cantante de Jackson , Mississippi ) , Giuseppe y Giovanni ( el duo dinamico de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dos chiquitas frivolantes de Barcelona , Espaa ) . <P> These people do not exist , of course , but Don Pepe 's uncle , who manages a Coca-Cola bottling plant , has lent him the money to stage an elaborate bluff . The " parade of stars " consists of Don Pepe 's nephew , cousin , stepdaughter and daughter . What follows is a show biz nightmare of ineptitude - jugglers who drop their props , dancers who bump into each other and acrobats who can not hold each other up . The decrepit old black blues singer and guitarist faces the back of the stage , thumps his foot , forgets all his music and caroms into the pit . Perhaps the funniest skit is one featuring Toulouse-Lautrec , who slithers around with shoes on his knees and tries desperately to heft a huge canvas onto an easel beyond his reach . <P> As may be guessed , a substantial part of the evening 's humor consists of watching people make fools of themselves . This trait is human enough to make some playgoers hold their sides and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
