A vast new industry built on coal , shale and garbage <P> More than building the first atomic bomb , more even than putting the first men on the moon , the creation from scratch of an entirely new industry to produce synthetic fuels would be the most ambitious technical venture that the U.S. has ever undertaken . From outright subsidies to price guarantees , the Government would offer many incentives for private firms to produce oil-like liquids and natural gas from the nation 's plentiful coal , shale rock and biomass. * Congressmen are infatuated with the idea of synthetic-fuel production . Cracks Representative Clarence Brown of Ohio : " Every committee in Congress has a synfuel bill , except the Ethics Committee . " <P> The best bet is thought to be production of oil and gas from coal . Carter has set a goal of the equivalent of 1 million to 1.5 million bbl. a day by 1990 . The technology is well known . South Africa gets 10% of its oil from coal and expects the total to rise to 48% by 1983 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under great pressure to 900 F. As the coal decomposes , it releases oil and gas . Another extraction method , which adds hydrogen to coal that is heated under pressure , will be tested at a small , experimental plant operated by several oil companies in Catlettsburg , Ky . It should be able to convert 600 tons of coal into 1,800 bbl. of oil a day . At a DOE-funded plant in Fort Lewis , Wash. , Gulf Oil since 1974 has been testing yet another process called " solvent refined coal , " which uses chemicals to remove impurities from the synthetic oil . <P> Another possibility is unconventional gas , which is the same as natural gas , but much harder to extract . It is found under the surface-in the Rocky Mountain region , in the shales of Appalachia , in huge underground caverns stretching below land and sea along the coastlines of Louisiana and east Texas , and in many coal seams all over the country . Because it is costly , the development of unconventional gas had been blocked until natural gas price controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the equivalent of 500,000 to 1 million bbl. of oil a day by 1990 . <P> Though the U.S. has some oil-saturated tar sands , they are not large or accessible enough to justify expensive exploitation by the Government . But some 76 billion bbl. in oil , about three times the nation 's proven reserves of conventional crude , are known to be recoverable from the shale rock concentrated in western Colorado and stretching into Utah and Wyoming . No plants are in operation at present , but at least five companies are running experimental digs in the area . To produce a barrel of oil , about 1 tons of rock must be mined and heated . So far , the process requires huge amounts of water - scarce in the West-and leaves huge piles of ashlike rubble . To avoid mining and the problems it brings , Occidental Petroleum is testing a new method . Fires are started in underground mines to separate the oil into pools ; then it is pumped to the surface . That technique is promising but far from perfected . <P> The conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . Power plants in many cities , including New York , Chicago and Milwaukee , burn garbage to produce electricity , and more and more grain , sugar cane , wood wastes and other residues are being fermented into alcohol fuels .
