YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN <P> Directed by MEL BROOKS Screenplay by GENE WILDER and MEL BROOKS <P> Of course it 's funny . <P> And of course it 's grating , flatulent , desperate-all in the best and the worst manner of Mel Brooks . As comic and as film maker , Brooks wants to knock you cockeyed . For a laugh , he will do anything , try anything . He rains gags . After a Brooks bit , audiences can be exhausted ; after a Brooks film , there is the lingering feeling of having been pummeled . Brooks is like a young , slightly skittish fighter whose energy compensates for lack of finesse . He hits out wildly , continuously , hoping that a few punches will land . Since comedy audiences usually have their guard down ( they want to be entertained and they expect the pile-driving ) , Brooks generally succeeds . He keeps the pressure turned up high , and the laughs batter their way through . The attack is so relentless , it can leave the viewer bruised as well as amused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is frenzy ; the nominal subject of Young Frankenstein-the skyhook for all the madness-is a satirical exhumation of Mary Shelley 's classic . The Shelley story ought to have turned wormy by this time from virtually constant exposure . It is , however , still a powerful myth . One good measure of its resiliency is that even when Brooks is lampooning it , the story remains compelling , nearly inviolate . When Gene Wilder 's Dr. Frankenstein tries to zap life into a grotesque , inanimate form , the movie goes serious despite itself . The myth is better , more involving than the jokes being made about it . <P> The larkish script concerns a descendant of Victor Frankenstein-a level and kindly sort who is forever being ridiculed for his forebear 's madness . An edict in an old will summons young Frankenstein to middle Europe , and he travels to Transylvania by train . ( " Pardon me , boy , " he inquires , " is this the Transylvania Station ? " ) . He is greeted by Igor ( Marty Feldman ) , a hunchbacked servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mist-shrouded Castle Frankenstein . Soon he stumbles on Victor 's secret experimental notes , bound in handsome leather and stamped HOW I DID IT . " What a fruitcake ! " young Frankstein cries out in disbelief . He is quickly seduced , though , by the siren call of Victor 's madness and is soon trying to reproduce the experiments . He is aided by a shapely but vacant assistant called Inga ( Teri Garr ) and by the stainless-steel housekeeper Frau Blucher , played by Cloris Leachman , who does a skillful and witty parody on the Judith Anderson role in Hitchcock 's Rebecca .
