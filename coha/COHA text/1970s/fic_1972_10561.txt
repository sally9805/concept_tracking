" Back in Fairly Close all of her friends and Martha Nell Burch just thought I was a rascal , more or less . " The nitwit was getting dark pink in the face and kind of weaving back and forth . " You 're all wise guys , is that it ? Big football deals . Holy fucking Moses , these goddamn football types , " he said .

" Well , that 's the sad part . She wanted to be here but she phoned up to say that her cattle are sick , " Shake said . " You 're full of shit , " said the guy . " No , sir . That 's the cattle .

I told the man that stud athletes like us42 PART ONE GOOD OLD PALS 43had to get to bed pretty early . Cissy Walford just kept staring at Shake and frowning . " Well , hero , " the nitwit said . " I just hope you can make more sense in the LA Coliseum on Sunday than you did here tonight . " " Will you be there ? " Shake asked . " Hell , I did n't come all the way out to California to stand around with this bunch of drunks from New York . " " New York ? Is there anybody here from New York ? " Shake said .

Shake laughed and said , " God love America . " And we left . I 'm afraid we made a bit of a spectacle of ourselves at Ugo 's later on . We started making up stories about Martha Nell Burch in the middle of our lemon veal and fettucini .

Shake said she probably would have fallen hopelessly GOOD OLD PALS 4Cin love with Bubba Littleton , who was our equivalent of T. J. Lambert . Bubba Littleton was a second-string tackle from Odessa who once went one whole semester without bathing , shaving , combing his hair or brushing his teeth . He did it to get back at Honey Jean Lester for breaking up with him . Shake said Bubba smelled like Albania . Bubba Littleton could n't top T. J. Lambert for sheer , all-out filth but he had his moments . Shake brought up the time we all went out on a varsity picnic at Lake Worth and Bubba got caught by his date , Honey Jean Lester , while he was beating off underneaththe dock . Honey had walked out on the dock looking to see if Bubba was among the water skiers . But when she accidentallyglanced down between some cracks in the boards , there was Bubba in the shallow water and the shade staring at some lovelies on the beach for inspiration  --  and flogging away . At dinner Shake imitated Honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You done grossed me out for the last time . " When we got back to our palatial suite at the Beverly Stars Hotel , Shake and Barbara Jane were feeling romanticso they excused themselves . First , though , Barbara Jane gave me a kiss and explained to Cissy Walford that she and Shake had to go study Sunday 's game plan. 46 PART ONEShe said to Cissy , " Do n't you and Billy C. do any foolin ' around now . " I turned on the TV and tried to look at a fag cowboy for a while with Cissy Walford 's dandy lungs resting on my arm . I tried to look at the TV while she looked at me . It wo n't hurt anything , I guess , to say that old Billy Clyde finished off the evening by doing his manly duty . I 've got to say , however , that I could have done it a little better if Cissy had n't asked me a question in the middle of some serious goings-on . " I do n't understand something , " Cissy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what ? " I want to say that I got woke up this morning by Cissy Walford handing me the telephone through her long yellow hair . She stretched and blinked her milelongeyelashes and seemed to be saying that there was a man on the phone who wanted to know if I had heard his imitation of a cricket . " Sumbitch . " I smiled . " Elroy Blunt . " That 's who it was . When I first knew Elroy Blunt he was a semi-talented defensive back . In those days he certainly did n't have his handlebar mustache and his hair like Prince Valiant . Elroy had played ball when I first got to know him at Memphis State , and me and Shake met him at the EastWestShrine Game and the Hulu Bowl and the Coaches ' All-America Game and the College All-Star Game , all of which is the post-season circuit that senior studs travel on . GOOD OLD PALS 47Elroy played one season with the Steelers after that . But then he quit . He was always jacking around with a guitar anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he had finally made it pretty big . Elroy , of course , was crazy . And he was no more predictable than what I hear about bad wives . Elroy Blunt was apt to call you up from Portugal or somewherejust to say he had set a new headache record . On the telephone for a minute or two , of course , I did n't hear anything but cricket sounds . Then Elroy said , " Clyde , this here 's your favorite cousin , Bernice Lovejowl , and -4 just been busted in Paraguay for going down on the mayor . I need two thousand to scoop up and bail out . " I giggled a hello . " Clyde , " Elroy said . " I 'd first off like an explanation about that lovely sound of young wool that answered the electric telephone at this early hour . " I explained that it was the utterly fantastic Cissy Walford . " Who might that be ? " Elroy said . " That 's the American name she chose , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapped-up Cambodian hooker who stopped over to help me work a pornographic jigsaw puzzle . " Cissy pinched my thigh until it almost bled . Elroy said , " Well , I 'd like to sing that little jewel a tune . " I gave Cissy the phone and leaned over so I could listen in . Elroy proceeded to sing a medley of his biggies. 48 PART ONEHe sang " I 'm Just a Bug on the Windshield of Life " and then he sang " Eight Killed at the Intersection " and then he sang " Slept All Day in the Lobby . " " That 's incredibly marvelous , " said Cissy . She listened to Elroy for a moment and squealed and handed me the phone . " He wanted to know whether I liked Hershey bars , running water or vibrators the best , " she said . I told Elroy it was good to know he had n't changed . " Clyde , " he said . " Son , I have called you up on a matter of important business . " I said yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to know if you studs are gon na win that big old sports event on Sunday . " I said , " We are if the Pope ai n't a nigger . " Elroy said , " Now , Clyde , you know what I mean . I want to know for sure if you folks think you can handle them other folks . Hell , you 've seen all them old films and all . Son , I just know you must have seen something in them films that 'll help my confidence . I got to have my confidence helped before I go runnin ' off to bet Mamma and Papa and Sister Marvene and the kids and the trailer rent and all . " " They 're a good team , " I said . " Aw , shit , Clyde . That do n't tell me nothing . I know they 're a good team . Hell , everybody 's a good team , " he said . I asked him what the price was now , just out of curiosity . Elroy said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downGOOD OLD PALS 49to pick because one of their niggers got hurt or some-thing . " I said , " Those dog-asses do n't have anybody hurt . " " Well , then , the New York Jews done bet it down to pick , " Elroy said . " They did open three and a half , did n't they ? " I said , mostly to myself . " Just as if it was Texas playin ' Oklahoma , " he said . " Looks to me like a Super Bowl ought to be consideredeven , " I said . " It 's even now . Them Jews done bet it down , " he said . " But they opened up on top , " I said . " Well , hell yeah , " Elroy said . " Clyde , they been in this old Super Bowl before . Two or three times . But you ai n't . That 's why I got to know something . " " We have n't found out much , " I said . Elroy said , " Clyde , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me both know it . All I want to know , son , is which one of them old defensive backs of theirs is a fag or has the clap or ca n't cover the outs . You know what I mean . " I said , " Gambling is sinful . " " Clyde , I got to know somethin ' , " Elroy said . " Now looky here . I want to bet my chest and lungs and kidneys and my future heart transplant on this thing . I got me some old Jet fans that want to give me three , four , five and six and I 'm just about to lap it up . But I got to know a thing or two . You gon na get ' em ? " " I want to hear some more singing , " I said . Elroy whooped and said , " Clyde , I 'm gon na let you be the first to listen to my new golden record . " 5o PART ONE GOOD OLD PALS 51I tilted the phone over toward Cissy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Elroy sing " I 'd Give a Dollar for a Dime to Put in This Machine and Play the Song That Brings You Back to Me . " It was pretty good . " Do n't that mother knock your dicks in the dirt ? " Elroy said . I laughed a yes . Then I asked Elroy where on Earth he was calling from , and he said he thought he was in Atlanta but then it might be Seattle . " Why do n't you look out the window and find out ? " I said . " There ai n't nothin ' out the window but a cruel world , Clyde . There 's ambulances and fire engines and insurance salesmen and data computers and all kinds of things out there , " he said . " Probably some police , too , " I said . " Naw , " said Elroy . " There ai n't none of them . Did n't you hear ? The niggers got ' em all fired . " I said , " The police might be wearing plain clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If there was any cops around they 'd be wearin ' their blue . You know how they like that blue . I 'm gon na write me a song about the cops one of these days . I 'm gon na call it Blue . ' " I told Elroy I had to get up and go to a squad meeting pretty soon . " Clyde , listen , " he said . " There 's one other thing . Old Elroy Blunt is gon na be out there day after tomorrow . " " Oh , shit , " I said . " Sure enough gon na be there , " he said . " Got me a big old house rented for the weekend in Bel Air . I 'm bringin ' in more pounds of barbecue and Scotch and them funny little old cigarettes than you have ever dreamed about , and I am also bringin ' me an ensemble of horny little old debutantes that I 'm sure you and your pals will want to say hello to .

" No way you 'll see any of us that night . " " We 'll start early , " Elroy said . " Now , Clyde , I know you well enough to know that you do n't sit around and draw circles and X 's the night before a game . " " I do n't intentionally destroy myself either , " I said . " Ai n't no destroy , Clyde . Just some barbecue and a couple of drinks , and some , little old debutantes . It 'll help you relax . You 'll still grab your ten or twelve hours .

I may have neglected to mention that I 'm the Giants ' captain . Commissioner Cameron said he had already called up the dog-ass Jets ' captain , which is Andy Odom , who is not a bad tight end . " Did you remind him that his ass is in deep water on Sunday ? " I said . Commissioner Cameron laughed .

I asked the Commissioner if he 'd got any good wool lately . THE PHONE RANG AGAIN A WHILE ago but I did n't getaround to answering it because it happened that at the time I was in the pleasant process of pulling Cissy Walford'swool down over my ears like a helmet . GOOD OLD PALS 59I 'VE BEEN THINKING THAT TRYING to write a bookduring the week of the biggest week in my life is probably less fun than being next-to-last on a high school gangfuck . There are parts of it which I do n't mind because it helps me relax and take my mind off Dreamer Tatum . These are parts which I think of as being amusing . It 's the other parts that are a pain in the ass . All of the explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publishing company , LaGuerre &; Koming , will insist on being in the book . A lot of background stuff . You better not be shitting me , Jim Tom . I 've been at it for over an hour now , telling all about last night and this morning . And I 've just realized that I have n't ever begun to tell about people like our coach , Shoat Cooper , or the rest of the team , or in any depth about Shake Tiller or Barbara Jane . Shake 's in his bedroom of our palatial suite , either taking a nap or reading another book that some Russian wrote about God . And Barbara Jane has gone off to have some drinks with some advertising people . That 's another thing . I 've forgotten to mention that Barbara Jane models for a lot of commercials on TV and on signboards . In the world of modeling she 's a stud , is all she is . Probably everybody has seen her who has ever watched TV or driven a car . She 's the girl on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Kentuckians , those long skinny cigarettes . And she 's the Pacific Basin Airlines girl looking back over her shoulder with just the bikini bottoms on , strolling along Waikiki in Hawaii . About a year ago she was the girl on TV who did those funny imitations of a vampire bat , trying to get some kids to eat the right breakfast cereal . And she was also the girl on TV they dressed up like Cleopatra and put in a Volkswagen floating on a barge down the Nile . DDD and F did all those . Barb remembers having quite a time making that airline commercial in Hawaii , mainly because of Burt Danby , who 's the head of Doff , Danby , Dendle and Frederickson . Ever since Burt Danby thinks he discoveredBarbara Jane he 's been trying to nail her . Barb says she had to run a whole lot better than I ever did against the Cardinals or Eagles to keep from getting blitzed by Burt over in Hawaii when we were n't around . He still tries , now and then . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think everybody in New York has been in love with Barbara Jane at one time or another . She 's had every known swipe taken at her , but of course she does n't love anybody but Shake Tiller  --  and maybe me. 6o PART ONE Barb came up to New York when we did , just after we had signed with the Giants . We were all really happy to have been chosen by fate to wind up in the big city . The Giants had told me ahead of time that they were going to draft me . They had the second choice in the first round . I had said that I would n't sign unless they drafted Shake Tiller also . We were determined to play for the same team , even if we had to go to the Canadian League . I was taken first , of course , being a " white runner . " The Giants worked it out that Dallas , which had the third choice in the first round , drafted Shake for them . I think they had to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Dallas to do that . Anyhow , that 's how Shake and me became New York Giants . Barb had n't given any thoughts at all to becoming a model when we moved to New York . She immediately got a job at CBS as a secretary . She just strolled into the CBS sports department one day and one of their pro- ducers saw her and said , " If you can make coffee , you 're hired . " She could have walked into any building in Rockefeller Center and done the same thing . Barb is just so pretty she sometimes frightens people . Her main job at CBS seemed to be going to lunch for about four hours every day , to places like Mike Manuche 's on Fifty-second Street , which is a restaurant with a lot of sports paintings on the walls where Giant fans go to discuss trades . GOOD OLD PALS 61It was in Manuche 's one day that Burt Danby saw Barb for the first time and decided she ought to be a model . I 've heard her say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . Burt spotted her , walked over to the table , unzipped his fly , looked down at his crotch , and said , " Now , sir . Would you please stand up , give us your name , and tell us what you do ? " When Barb roared laughing , Burt knew he 'd found a good chick . He turned her over to his creative departmentat DDD and F and said , " I want her to be big , big , big . " In those days , even though Burt learned that Barb belonged to us , he high-played her all around town . He would always be thinking up reasons why the two of them had to have dinner or cocktails . I think he just likes to turn up at all of his joints with a winner on his arm . He likes to put on velvet jackets , hotcombhis hair , hang a bunch of gold shit around his neck  --  dogtags and animal heads and the like  --  and prance into Elaine 's up on Eighty-eighth and Second Avenue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable pride in being able to get a table anywhere he wants one , even Elaine 's , where movie stars and archdukes and shoe company presidents and a grand assortment of born-rich fools have been known to stand in line for hours . Barb does n't mind going along occasionally , even now . Especially if me and Shake are out of town . It gives her something to do , and of course everybody likes front row center. 62 PART ONE GOOD OLD PALS 63 " He 's harmless , " she says . " And he 's actually kind of sweet . " To which Shake says , " He wears Gucci underwear . " Well , I can joke about my employer , but I 'll tell you how strong he is . One night he took Barb and Shake and me up to Elaine 's and the narrow front room up there was packed as usual with all of the semi-artists and spoiled rich pricks who sit there and stare at each other 's dates and clothes . Seeing Burt was there and needed a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brooding poets and eye-shadow junkies so we could sit down . Burt leaped for the chair with his back against the wall , banged his fist on the table , and said , " Is n't this the super-est place in the whole world ? Broadway , I 'll lick you yet . " So anyhow Barb 's off with Burt Danby now and some other advertising nitwits , and Shake is either asleep or reading , and who I basically have on my mind is Shoat Cooper . I 'll tell you something . The great miracle of our age is that the Giants are in the Super Bowl with Shoat Cooper for a head coach . Him being the coach was a stroke of genius on the part of Burt Danby , by the way . When me and Shake were drafted , the head coach was Doyt Elkins , of course , who had originally been hired by the Maras , the old organization . I thought Doyt was a pretty good coach , considering that he only communicatedwith the players by memo . We could have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cowboys and took the whole staff with him , except for the head scout , which was none other than Shoat Cooper . Burt Danby did n't even look for anybody else . He said the press liked Shoat because they got drunk together . Besides , Burt said , he was sick of coaches who made the game so mysterious . When Burt announced that Shoat had the job at a press conference , he said , " God , I 'm just so up to here with zig-outs and fly patterns . I mean , the way they all talk , they just practically make me do a total face-down in the old salad . Shoat Cooper keeps its simple . And take it from an old advertising cock that if no one knows what you 're saying , you could n't sell welfare in Harlem . " What Burt did n't add was that Shoat Cooper came cheap . I 'm not sure where to begin to describe the country sumbitch . Shoat 's big . He does n't have much hair left . He looks like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he 's always looking around for somewhere to spit . He 's got a slow , deep , country voice . A husky kind of voice , like somebody who just woke up , or like a deputy sheriff talking to a spook who forgot to park his pickup truck between the white lines . I do n't think I 've ever seen Shoat act like he 's excited . The one time back during the regular season when wewere behind , which was at a halftime when the Redskins64 PART ONE had us down by thirty to fourteen on some lucky passes , Shoat Cooper just acted like nothing was any different . When we all walked into the locker room at Yankee Stadium and slammed our hats down , there was Shoat on a little stool in front of the blackboard , looking down at the floor . Everybody was bitching and moaning for a few minutes , those that had n't peed yet or done various things . Finally we plunked down and got quiet and looked at him . Shoat sat there , chewing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us about the first half . " Well , defense , " he groaned slowly . " Seemed to me like you all just kind of stood around and let ' em eat the apple off your head . " Then he spit . Nobody said anything back for a minute or so and then Puddin Patterson said , " They stuntin ' , Coach . On Blast and Cutback , that fuckin ' Seventy-six is comin ' from somewhere and I ca n't get a piece of him . " Shoat said hmmmmm . Puddin said , " I believe we can catch ' em , coach . We gon na roll like a big wheel this half . " Shoat said , " Well , we ai n't gon na catch nobody unless our defense gets together and decides that they ai n't gon na let ' em piss another drop . " Shoat said for the defense to go down to the other end of the locker room and get their problems worked out . T. J. Lambert drew himself up and said , " Awright , defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and get them tootie fruities . " GOOD OLD PALS 65The defense moved away as T. J. hiked his leg and cut a big one . Puddin Patterson said , " Coach , where that Seventysixcomin ' from ? " Shoat looked at the floor for a while and then he said , " I tell you what let 's do , Puddin . Let 's you just go out there this half and concentrate on tryin ' to hit ever sumbitch that 's wearin ' a different colored shirt . " Shoat 's idea for the second half was for Hose Manning to throw a couple of new patterns in the third quarter , get something else on the scoreboard , and then " outgut " the Redskins in the last quarter . He would always go back to the running game if you gave him half a chance . " If you run the football up somebody 's ass , " Shoat says , " then it 's them that has to get their hands dirty tryin ' to pull it out . " Early in that second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-five yards on a fly , and that brought us up to thirty to twenty-one . T. J. recovered a fumble right after that and Hose kicked a field goal to make it thirty to twenty-four . But after that , we did n't do anything but run old Billy Clyde . I carried the ball twenty-two times in the fourth quarter , and scored two sixes , and we finally won it , thirtyeightto thirty . I was a heavy-breathing sumbitch on the sideline toward the end , but Shoat Cooper put his arm around my shoulder pads and said , " Stud hoss , I ought to buy you a rubber dolly . That was pure dee football out there . " * * *66 PART ONE GOOD OLD PALS 67Shoat Cooper had been a great player in the NFL himself . The old-timers will tell you that there were n't many linebackers any better . Maybe Tommy Nobis was . Or Dick Butkus . But Shoat in his day was some kind of pisser , they say . They say he craved action so much he would beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him loose for the kickoff . Shoat came out of Arkansas , like his name suggests . He was from Possum Grape and played ball at the Universityof Arkansas , where the freshman team is called Shoats . But they say that 's not where he got his name , Shoat . Growing up , I hear , Shoat just looked like a baby pig , or a shoat , so somebody started calling him Shoat . I guess he might smile when we win Sunday . But in the three years he 's been our coach , he has n't . You would think that Shoat might have smiled once or twice during our regular season since we 're undefeated and untied and already have a diamond ring cinched for winning the National Conference . We won that , incidentally , by dough-popping the LA Rams thirty-three to thirty-one . I scored three sixes . But all that old Shoat has said all along is , " A football team with one more game to win ai n't no better off than a tired old farmer with one more pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Giants I guess the best thing you can say about Shoat is that he does n't fuck us around . Maybe there 's something to that . Maybe a team of pros can just get together and do the job , likewe would have done last year if a lot of us had n't been injured and gone seven-seven . Shake says this is true , and Shake is semi-intellectual about the game . Shake says , " Winning is a happy accident of getting a bunch of guys together who want to . " Shake has studied it a lot and he says that coaches are not so important in the pros . He says they 're important in college because there are those who can outsmart the others and outrecruit the others . " But in the pros , " he says , " there are studs on every team , and anybody can beat anybody else on a certain Sunday . It 's all a matter of which team do n't have the rag on . " Shake says that in the pros the teams that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my old buddy talks like this , I tell him he sounds about half like a Darrell Royal or somebody . Shake says hustle ai n't nothing but acting like a gorilla . " That 's the part that 's fun , " he says . " Hitting people and getting hit and rolling around on the carpet is easy . The hard part is making yourself do something right  --  at the right minute . " He says , " When you get twenty-two studs who find losing a football game the most distasteful thing in the world , then you got yourself a winner . Hell , everybody wants to win , or says they do . But not wanting to lose is what it 's all about . " Shake talked like this at our meeting this morning. 68 PART ONE " We 're just not gon na accept a loss to those dog-asses , " he said . " There 'll be a minute out there Sunday , " he said , " when one of us will do something better than he 's ever done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do it becausewe 'll all be tryin ' . " All Shoat Cooper said at the meeting was that we 'd stress the kicking game in workout this afternoon at UCLA , and then pose for some photographs with some starlets . They better not let T. J. Lambert get too close to those starlets . Hi , there , friends and neighbors . This is old Billy Clyde Puckett back from practice and showered and shaved and dolled up in his white-on-white-on-white , seeing as how I 'm out in California . Shake and Barbara Jane and Cissy have gone on off to dinner with Puddin Patterson and his wife , Rosalie . They all wanted to go hear somebody sing while they tried to eat but I said I did n't like anybody 's singing but Elroy Blunt . And anyway , I wanted to write some more . I said to call me later and I would go join them somewhere for half a dozen young Scotches . I got my burgers and fries and my coffee here in our palatial suite and I 'm finally going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Tiller . Well , now , I presume that most everybody is aware that Shake Tiller is the greatest ball-catching end there ever was . GOOD OLD PALS 69He has n't been anything but All-Pro since we came up . I guess he catches eighty or ninety balls a year , and this makes a pretty good quarterback out of Hose Manning , who I think is the best since Joe Namath and Sonny Jurgensen hung it up . Even the dumbest of the sports writers  --  and there are n't many smart ones  --  says Shake is probably better than Hutson or Alworth or any of those studs we 've heard about in history . The thing which makes Shake so great , aside from his hands and his speed and his moves , is that he runs a route so good . If he 's supposed to go seven and a half yards down and four and a half yards out , then Shake runs seven and a half yards down and four and a half yards out . Nobody knows it but not many receivers can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's got this red-blond hair that 's thick and flops around . He 's got a sort of dimpled chin and lots of good white teeth and some green-blue eyes that Barbara Jane says have an evil sparkle . His expression makes him look most often like he knows deep down everything there is to know , but naturally he does n't . He 's trim like split ends are supposed to be , which is kind of like country club lifeguards . And his voice is soft and cool . As long as I 've known him , which is forever , I 've never been able to figure out his voice . He has this way of making things sound like you never know if he 's truly serious . Even when he 's serious . The main thing is , Shake is my good buddy for a life-70 PART ONEtime , and I really guess that he 's my family since I never actually had another one worth mentioning . Not that I 'm complaining about it . I could n't have had more fun growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an uncle named Kenneth , I had plenty of folks concerned about me . Not that it matters any , but I guess you could say that I was from a broke fuckin ' home . My daddy ran off before I ever knew him . He was a tool dresser in the oil field , and I guess a fairly good bad-check artist . My mamma was a waitress and maybe a couple of other things , and she ran off , too . Which left me with Uncle Kenneth , who was not much more than a golf hustler , a pool shark and a pretty good gin rummy stud . Anyhow , kids grow up . And once they get to be fourteen , it 's out of everybody 's hands about what might happen to them except their juvenile delinquent friends . I was lucky that I had Uncle Kenneth to take me to all the football games I wanted to see , and to teach me how to run the six ball in snooker and that the best thing to do in gin was hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenneth always told me , " If you like sports and know how to gamble , then you 'll always be interested in something and you wo n't come to no real harm . " Me and Shake never had anything but good times . I ca n't think of anything that ever happened to us that we did n't think was funny , even some bad things . Really bad things , and not just losing the city championship once . Well , what 's worse than somebody dying ? GOOD OLD PALS 71It was really terrible one time but Shake 's real mother  --  not his mother now , but his real one  --  got killed in a car wreck when we were about sixteen . She did n't die right away , where she got hit by a carloadof drunk priests , but about three days later in the hospital . She died one night just after Shake and me had left her room and gone to the cold drink machine . We knew she was likely to die , though . She never had got conscious from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sr. , a really good old boy , had prepared us for the worst . But what I 'm getting at is that after Shake had sort of put his arm around his dad and strolled off down the hall with him , and after he had hugged his grandmother and his aunt while Barbara Jane and I just stood around , Shake came back and told everybody he just had to cut out . Move it on . The three of us left and did n't say anything to each other . We just kind of walked off in the general direction of Herb 's Cafe , where we hung out . But as we were walking along , Shake said something that I did n't think I heard right  --  something that sort of summed up how he was , and still is . " Well , it 's a wrap on the squash , " he said . I muttered a huh , or something . And Shake said , " I 've been trying to think of what good there could be in my mom dying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't have to look at any more fuckin ' squash on the dinner table . " Shake Tiller has always had what some people might call a strange sense of humor. 72 PART ONE GOOD OLD PALS 73People themselves have always been the funniest things of all to him . He 's a good imitator and he could always listen to somebody talk for just a little while and then sound like them . To this day , Shake can still imitate Big Ed Bookman so good it makes me and Barbara Jane collapse . Big Ed Bookman is Barb 's daddy . Big Ed Bookman is in the " oil bidness , " as Shake would say . Big Ed talks a lot about a " tax break for the oil bidness . " He talks about " buyin ' pipe , " and all of his production out in Scogie County . Things like that . Big Ed is a big man in Fort Worth , which some people say is not so hard a thing to be . Fort Worth is not exactly Dallas or Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a toll road . But that 's geography . In looks and money and getting things done , Fort Worth is about as far away from Dallas as I am from Shakespeare . I 'm afraid my old home town is in that part of Texas which does n't have the charm of the flat plains or the piny woods or the coastline or the mountains . The land looks like it could be almost anywhere in twelve or fourteen different states . The wind that sometimesblows across it is the same wind that blows across Oklahoma  --  untouched . We 've played ball down there in ever kind of weather you can imagine . In October it can get as hot as summer . And there are days during the summer when you can see the heat in the air . It looks like germs . It can also get colder than a nun 's ass . I do n't knowif many people outside of Texas know what a norther is , but a norther is when the sky turns the color of a battleshipand you can feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of ball in northers . Fort Worth has some pretty parts . There are neighborhoodswith little creeks running through them and lots of sycamore and oak trees . There 's a river winding around called the Trinity , and this could add something to it if it was n't always the color of meatloaf . My old alma mater of TCU  --  that 's Texas Christian University , of course  --  does n't have quite as much ivy covering its great halls of learning as your normal McDonald 's . It is just a bunch of cream-brick buildings and parking lots but the buildings are not so ugly compared to some grain elevators rising up on the outskirts of town . The good things about the town are most of the people , who are honest , unpretentious and work hard . And the Mexican food and barbeque , not to forget the chicken fried steak and cream gravy . But I 'm not sure this makes up for some kind of pride in ignorance that somebody like Big Ed Bookman seems to have . There 's an old city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and I suppose at one time there were a bunch of cowboys hanging around instead of used-car dealers and Jaycees . There used to be another slogan which went something like , " Dallas for Culture , Fort Worth for Fun . " But none of us ever knew what fun they were talking about , 74 PART O N Eunless it was trying to get on one of the thirteen roads leading out . Maybe they meant the fun we had to dream up for ourselves , which was always plentiful . We used to ask Barbara Jane why somebody as rich as Big Ed Bookman would stay in Fort Worth . She always answered the same thing . " Would a czar leave Russia if they were n't pissed off at him ? " she 'd say . It still bewilders me somewhat . Big Ed Bookman can live anywhere he wants to , but he stays in a town where you still have to stop your car for freight trains and look at signs which need repainting or have one neon light missing . Big Ed always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you looked at it a certain way . If you took all the Jews out of Dallas , all the niggers out of Houston and all the spicks out of San Antonio , Fort Worth was a pretty good-sized place , he 'd say . Big Ed is big in everything in Fort Worth , of course . Big in " bidness . " Big in golf . Big at River Crest , his country club . Big in TCU football , having bought the AstroTurf for the stadium when TCU fired a couple of assistant coaches he did n't like . Big in what passes for society in Fort Worth . Big Ed Bookman is always flying down to Houston , where he keeps his " oil bidness " office , or he 's flying out to Colorado to one of his ranches , or he 's flying up to Washington , D.C. , or he 's flying to Acapulco . For as long as I can remember , Big Ed has always been on the board of a lot of banks . And he 's talkedGOOD OLD PALS 75about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Does n't seem like anybody  --  to this day  --  can do anything in Fort Worth unless they ask old Big Ed Bookman about it . Big Ed is married to Big Barb , and in her own way Big Barb is as big as Big Ed around Fort Worth . Big Barb has always been in charge of who got to be a Fort Worth debutante , as if there ever was such a thing . She 's in charge of all kinds of charities and theaters . She 's in charge of redecorating the country club . She 's Ilways in charge of everybody 's party and vacation and clothes and schools and voting . She 's also some kind of history nut . I mean in the sense that she 's always tracing the Bookinans back to Henry the Fuckin ' Eighth or Sam the Fuckin ' Houston . I 've got to say that they 're still handsome people . Big Ed is tall and most of his hair he 's still got . It 's gray but thick . He always has a tan and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricky loafers . Big Barb is pretty scenic her own self . She 's still slender and fairly elegant of eyes and teeth . She can lay some hairdos on you , and some heavyweight jewelry . She goes around smiling most of the time and looking at herself in hubcaps , or whatever she can find that will cause a reflection . She 's a semi-brunette . But I started out to say how Shake can imitate Big Ed , who has a deep , important voice . Shake 's favorite line to imitate is Big Ed in a restaurant. 76 PART ONE " Uh , little lady , " Big Ed will say , " I 'll have one of your sixteen-ounce T-bones medium rare . " This is Shake doing his Big Ed routine : " The thing that bothers the world today is a bunch of goddamn kids who do n't have any respect for what made this the greatest goddamn country in the world . " This country is great because of what the white man did with it . There was n't a goddamn thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anything about schools or golf courses or any other goddamn thing . " But the white man came in and kicked the shit out of the blacks and the browns and the yellows and made the world a decent place that smelled better and had johns that flushed . " It was the white man who invented the electric light and the airplane and the television and the air condition- ing and every other goddamn thing worth having . " If the white man had left it up to the black man or the brown man , we would n't have anything but a bunch of goddamn disease and lice and probably a hell of a lot of Communism . " Kids today ought to look at the white man and stop lookin ' at niggers and spicks . That 's where they find out about dope and screwing off . " If you do n't mind me saying so , it 's people like me  --  Big Ed Bookman  --  that made this country what it is . I employ about ten thousand people , one way or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as they work their ass off . " Hard work never hurt anybody . I 've worked hard ever since my daddy found oil in Scogie County . I could have GOOD OLD PALS 77just let our family fortune go to hell and played golf all the time , but I did n't . I only played part of the time , and there 's not a goddamn thing wrong with recreation . It 's American . " Let me give you an equation that affects today 's kids . One nigger plus one spick equals Communism and dope . It 's all tied in together . " Uh , little lady , I 'll have one of your sixteen-ounce T-bones , medium rare . " I had to stop to answer the phone . It was Barbara Jane calling up to say that the place where they were at , something called the Macadamia Nut , had a comedian who was about as funny as a late night talk show and a singer who was at least as good as T. J. Lambert . She said they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and call me again . I was still writing . " I 'm talking about your folks , " I said . Barbara Jane said , " Oh , shit . Did you put in there that Big Barb 's ancestors invented the spinning wheel and the hunting dog ? " " And the hundred-dollar bill , " I said . Say , luv , this place is a wrap , " she said . " We think we 'll go take a look at a new club called the Ho Chi Minh Trail . It 's right there on Rodeo where everything else is . You ca n't miss it . " " Is it near the caviar joint ? " I asked . " Right , " said Barb . " A block down from Nicholas and Alexandra 's Caviarteria , and across the street from78 PART ONE GOOD OLD PALS 79that sandwich shop where the out-of-work actors hang out . Poopoo and Ricky 's Suede Cadillac . You 'll see it . " " I 'll find it , " I said . " Sure sounds like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical assault from old Twenty-three within an hour or so . " " O.K. , " Barb said . " You write that old book now , boy . You write that old book real good and we 'll get you some quail and some brown gravy and some biscuits . That ai n't no bad way to start off the day , is it ? " " Got to go now , " I said . " Bye . " " Billy Clyde Puckett , you get down off that roof ! " Barb said . " See you in a while , " I said . " You come in this house right now before I take a switch to you , " Barb said . " Bye , " I said . " Love , luv , " she said , and hung up . By now you may have figured out that Barbara Jane Bookman has a bit of a satirical nature . She has always been able to make me laugh , just like Shake Tiller . In terms of growing up , I 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever knew . Before Shake , even . I could give you a fairly good example by telling about the time the three of us got expelled from Fuller Junior High . It happened because the three of us were in old lady Murcer 's music class one day in the high seventh , and old lady Murcer had to leave the room for a while and she let Barbara Jane , her pet , preside over the class . Barb 's job was to stand up at old lady Murcer 's desk and lead us in a few songs until old lady Murcer got back . Everything went along fine for a couple of songs , but then Shake Tiller held up his hand . " Yes , Marvin , what is it ? " said Barb , snootily . Shake said , " Miz Bookman , I was wondering if we could sing something besides this daffodil shit ? " Barb laughed like hell , along with everybody else . Then she said fine , we could sing whatever we wished , provided Shake and me got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . We got up there and proceeded to lead the class inwhat we thought was the funniest song we 'd ever heard . What we sang was , " Down , Down , Down with R. E.Turner . " R. E. Turner was the principal , naturally . The song went : Down , down , down with R. E. Turner . He 's a dirty horse manure , Horseshit ! They forgot to pull the chain , Consequently , he 'll remainTil they disinfect theFort Worth city sewers . I do n't recall how many times we sang it , or how far down the corridor anybody could hear it . But R. E. Turner heard it and when we finished it the last time , he appeared in the doorway of our room . Seems like the three of us sat in R. E. Turner 's office for about an hour before Big Ed got there. 8o PART ONE Mr. Turner just sat there boiling and looking at some papers on his desk . We tried to sit quietly and not look at each other because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , Mr. Turner told Barbara Jane , " Young lady , I hope you realize that this may cost you the state spelling championship . " Shake blurted out , " Aw , gee . Not that . Anything but that . " And Barbara Jane bit her lip to keep from breaking up . Mr. Turner told me , " It 's not really your fault , Puckett . You 've always been easily led . " When Big Ed came in , he insisted that we be allowed to stay in Mr. Turner 's office and listen to their con- versation . " I do n't have anything to say that I ca n't say in front of anybody in this great world . That 's what it 's like to be totally honest , " said Big Ed . Mr. Turner nodded . Big Ed said , " Now , R. E. , let 's you and me try to remember our younger days when we got into scrapes of one kind or another . Thank God there was somebody around to help us out . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my daughter and these two young men that Mrs. Bookman and I know to be fine , clean , honest young men . " Mr. Turner said he appreciated Big Ed 's concern . " Now , R. E. , I know that your immediate impulse is to expel these youngsters and teach them a lesson . But let 's think about that for a minute . " GOOD OLD PALS 81Big Ed leaned forward and said , " You know what that would accomplish ? You 'd lose a possible state spellingchampion , and I know for sure you 'd lose the city junior high track and field championship next week . " Mr. Turner said those things were n't so important . Mr. Turner said what we had done was so bad that we ought to be kicked out for the rest of the semester and made to take the high seventh over again . Big Ed cleared his throat . " Now , R. E. , " he said . " I think you ought to give some consideration to the fact that if we kick these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll fall behind the other kids , and the next thing we know , they 'll drop out of school altogether and get involved in dope and start hanging around with undesirables like some of these unfortunates you 've been busing in here . " Mr. Turner did n't say anything . " Now , R. E. , you just give some consideration to your own youth , " said Big Ed . Mr. Turner said he had never done anything like we did . Big Ed then said , " Well , R. E. , why do n't you give some goddamn consideration to who the hell I am ? " Mr. Turner said we 'd be out for three days . That was the best he could do , and Big Ed marched out like a winner . Big Ed decided to drive all of us over to his house on Bookman Lane , which was Barbara Jane 's old home beforeBig Ed built the new one on River Crest 's tenth fairway , which he made the club sell him , even though it left8z PART ONE GOOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The drive was fairly quiet until Big Ed said , " Well , Barbara Jane , could you tell me just what you think of these two punks here who got you into all this ? " Barbara Jane said , " Mostly Dad , I think they 're pretty rotten singers . " Big Ed fumed the rest of the way . When we got there , he made us sit down in the den , where we could look at his golf trophies and his stuffed animal heads and his framed letters from various politicalstuds , who thanked him for being for America . Big Ed said Big Barb would be home in a minute and then we would all talk about our futures . Big Ed then left us alone in the den . I think he went to phone up Wall Street and sell Libya . Barbara Jane said her mother was probably at a meeting of the Daughters of the Intimate Friends of the Dumb-Asses who stayed at the Alamo , or something . Shake called his daddy at the store they owned , Tiller Electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . I remember that listening to Shake on the phone I got the impression that his daddy did n't think any of it was a very big deal . I remember hearing Shake saying , " Yeah , really , Dad . For singing dirty . Yeah , an old song about Mr. Turner . With a bad word or two in it . Yeah . Yeah . No , sir , it was mainly because Barbara Jane was doing it with us and she 's a girl and all . Yes , sir . I 'll tell her . Him , too . Yes , sir . O.K. Bye . " I would have called Uncle Kenneth but I knew therewere n't any phones on the fifteenth green at Rockwood Muny . Anyhow , he 'd have only been interested in whether we would get back in school in time for the dashes and the broad jump . Big Barb finally came in wearing big round yellow sunglasses , pants , rings on every finger , her hair pulled straight back like a Flamenco dancer , a short drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " This is certainly a new experience for the Bookman family . I 'm so ashamed of you three that I 'm actually numb . " Shake said , " It was my fault , Miz Bookman . " " Was not , " Barbara Jane said . Big Ed said that if it had n't been for him we 'd all be out for the semester . Shake said he sure did thank Mr. Bookman for saving us , and he mainly wanted to apologize for getting BarbaraJane in trouble . I said me too . Shake said , " My daddy says he feels real bad about Barbara Jane being involved . " " Your father 's a very nice man , " said Big Barb . " I 've shopped in his little store many times . I think that fixturein the hallway came from there . " Shake said it could have . Barbara Jane said it probably did . I said I did n't know . " Is his little store still in the same place , over there by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Barb asked . Barbara Jane said , " Oh , terrific , Mom . " 84 85 " Yes , Ma'am , " said Shake . " Over there on Nelson Avenue is where it 's still at . " I said that 's right . Over on Nelson Avenue . Big Barb said , " Barbara , I only meant that the town 's changing faster than we can keep up with it . " " Sure , " Barbara Jane said . Shake cleared his throat . So did I. Nobody said anything for a minute or two , and then Big Barb said , " As a matter of fact , I think those two carriage lamps on the front door came from Tiller Elec- tric . " Might have , said Shake . Probably did , I said . Barbara Jane sighed and put her elbows on her knees and put her chin in the cups of her hands and closed her eyes . Big Ed said , " Uh , honey , these boys and your daughter have promised me that their behavior in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of school will teach them a pretty good lesson . " " Of course , it will be talked about at River Crest , " Big Barb said . " I would n't worry much about that , " said Big Ed . " I 'm sure you wo n't , " Big Barb said . " You 'll be in Houston . " Big Ed said , " River Crest do n't talk about a goddamn thing that I do n't tell ' em to talk about , so that 's that . " Big Barb looked away and smoked . Shake and me glanced at each other and Barbara Jane blinked . Big Ed said , " This is n't exactly the end of the goddamn world . It is n't anything that intelligent white people ca n't handle . " Barbara Jane said , " I wonder how unintelligent black people handle it . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " said Big Ed . " I was just thinking out loud , " Barbara Jane said . " That was n't very funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shake looked at each other . " Let 's wrap this up , " Big Ed said . " Jake Ealey 's gon na stop by in a minute and we 've got to talk about what we 're gon na do with that goddamn Alaska property . " We stood up . " Be sure and tell your father hello , " said Big Barb . " He 's a goddamn nice fellow , " Big Ed said . Shake said thank you . He would . Big Barb looked at me and said , " How 's your , uh , your Uncle Kermit these days ? " " Kenneth , " I said . " Yes , of course , " she said . " Is he getting along fine ? " I guess so , I said . He still plays at scratch . Big Ed said , " Kenneth Puckett was one hell of a golfer around here a few years ago . " Must have been , I said . " There was a time when some of us at the club thought seriously about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Ed . " Probably should have . He 'd have probably made us a ton . " " And him , too , " Shake said . " Damn right he would have , " Big Ed said . " Well , listen , you hot shots . Mind your damned old singing now. 86 PART ONE And keep my daughter out of trouble , all right ? " Shake and me smiled and said we would . We were walking out the front door when Big Ed said , " What the hell 's Kenneth doing these days ? " Shake said , " Near as me and Billy C. can figure out , he 's got some kind of position in the Fort Worth under- world . " Big Ed and Big Barb managed a nervous laugh . Then Big Barb said , " You boys do n't be strangers now . You know you 're welcome here any time . " " See you , Barb , " said Shake . " Later , " I said . We jogged off through the big yard but before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates , Shake stopped and looked back . " Hey , Mrs. Bookman , " he hollered . " Next time you 're over at the store , do n't mind all those Mexicans . All they ever do is go to sleep in the dirt . You can just step over ' em . " We heard Barbara Jane howling as we turned and trotted off . Even then , she had that great laugh . Jim Tom Pinch has said that there ought to be some- thing in the book about the life that me and Shake lead when we 're not playing ball . Something about what we do during the off-season . And as he put it , " Something about your aptitudes and attitudes , other than football . " I think this is a lot of boring crap , Jim Tom , but I 'll try to cover it quickly , if aptitude means what I think it does . GOOD OLD PALS 87Actually , when I stop to think about this , it makes me kind of hot . Not you , Jim Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think a ball player is anything but a go-rilla . I 'd like to make it clear that me and Shake lead a very quiet and decent life in the off-season . We pretty much stay in New York through the winter and spring . And by that time , of course , it 's getting near the start of another training camp . Maybe a day or two a week we 'll go off somewhere and make a speech at a luncheon or banquet . We get anywhere from three hundred to five hundred a pop , depending on how much the Sioux Falls Quarterback Club  --  or some such thing  --  can afford . A lot of studs hold down steady jobs in the off-season because they have to in order to feed their families . We 're lucky , I think . We make good money and do n't have to do that . Work , I mean . Now and then you have to spend the night somewhere on the banquet circuit . But this does n't have to be total agony if some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindhearted secretary on you , or maybe even some of their private stock . I 've been known to have me some good times in some surprising places . Akron wore my ass out once , and so did Omaha . And Shake Tiller always speaks fondly of Terre Haute and Oklahoma City . When it warms up around New York , we try to play some golf . I suppose that I ought to confess that the only thing88 PART ONE GOOD OLD PALS 89I 'd ever be interested in doing besides playing ball would be to run my own restaurant or bar . That might be all right sometime , after I 'm crippled . I know the kind of place I 'd want . It would have to be located in the Fifties on the near East Side so the clientele would n't have to worry about getting shot or stabbed . It would serve a big drink and stay open late and there would n't be any Frenchmen waiting tables . I 'd encourage a lot of wool to hang around for set decoration . There 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them very close together so the customerswould n't have to bore each other with their talk about business or clothes or kids . Nobody would wear a tie . Elroy Blunt would be on the juke box . And you 'd be able to get decent things to eat like chili , real barbecue and black-eyed peas . I 'd probably call it something like the Triple Option and hang some pictures on the wall of Shake Tiller . But that 's a few years off . As for Shake Tiller , his interests run a little wider than mine . For one thing , he likes to jack around in the stock market with our money . He likes the action . " There 's a new ball game every day , " he says . He does O.K. , by the way , which he says is not surprisingbecause most everybody in real-life business is a dunce . He likes to say , " I never knew a chairman of the board of anything that I 'd let run an elevator for me . " Shake says one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boss of something . I 've heard him say , " Every time I 'm introduced to somebody who 's supposed to know all about television or politics or Wall Street , he 's a goddamn drop case . " He 's said , " So far as I can figure out , the only three ways to get to the top in business is to get born rich , marry it , or be so fuckin ' dumb they ca n't do anything but promote you to get you out of the way . " We do a couple of other things during the off-season that have helped Shake form this opinion . We have lunch a lot with dumb-asses who are " friends " of the Giants , and we spend a few random nights in places like " Twenty-one " talking to other dumb-asses . I guess we like to drink and laugh at the drop cases or we would n't do it . In fact , Shake once said he 'd be perfectly happy if the whole world was semi-dark and indoors . That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other people around Clarke 's and Manuche 's . Maybe if Shake was n't a ball player he 'd be a stud in public relations because he 's handsome , a dude dresser , and has the gift of bullshit . I think he 'd be good in television , if he wanted to do it , and from the money he 's made for us in investments , I know damn well he could run a curl pattern on Wall Street . Our apartment is pretty much known as a landmark around town . It 's the penthouse on the eighteenth floor of a seminewbuilding at Sixty-fifth and First . We 've got a big living room and a bar , two big bedrooms , a kitchen with90 PART ONE GOOD OLD PALS 91 a bar , and a terrace . Shake has done it up pretty neat with thick carpet all over and comfortable furniture . And we 've got a couple of fireplaces . We 've got stereo coming out of everywhere and color TV 's built in here and there . We 've got some paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out to be whatever you want them to be . There are a few blown-up photographs of us around , scoring touch- downs and getting our dicks knocked off . There 's a great big photograph of Puddin Patterson 's little cousins , Albert and Bowie , sitting on our bench on a cold day at Yankee Stadium , sitting between me and Shake . Oh , yeah , and we 've got a Siamese cat named Martha Nell who 's a rotten , surly bitch that hates us and tries to eat up all of our cashmere sweaters . Mainly , our apartment is known as a landmark be- cause we have a considerable number of parties there , some planned and some not . We always have one after a home game . Most of the guys on the team come up to see if we 've discovered any new stewardesses in the building , or if Barbara Jane has any new model friends who might be half-horny . When we first got up to New York we instituted the regular Monday afternoon all-skate during the fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a few light hooks to come in , get drunk , take naked , and have what we called an Eastern Regional Eat-Off . Some of our TV friends that we met learned how to drop by for lunch , take part in the skate , and still make the old five forty-seven to Greenwich . T. J. Lambert still holds the record for having performedthe most formidable deed at a Monday all-skate . One time there were these three spade hooks in attendance . They were hard-hitters and really good-natured . They let T. J. get them defrocked and boost them up on the mantel over the fireplace in the living room . I can still see them sitting up there with their legs spread , singing like the Supremes , while T. J. took turns eating all three . T. J. still refers to our apartment as " Sperm City . " Well , I got to go off to the bright lights of Beverly Hills now . Probably ought to just stay here in our palatial suite and drink milk shakes since the dog-ass Jets are coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say at times , " Ca n't a man ever unwind ? Is it all just work and worry ? " That 's his way of excusing a few young Scotches and a couple of drags on those anti-God cigarettes that a man gets handed to him now and then . Might be some of that tonight , in fact . So this is Billy Clyde Puckett 's last mercy message of the evening . The port side is starting to list . Clear the rafts . Hymn singers and female impersonators over the side first . Hope I do n't need my I.D . card to get a drink in the Ho Chi Minh Trail . Which suddenly reminds me of what Shake Tiller used92 PART ONEto say when we were kids and somebody would ask our age before selling us a cold Pearl . Shake would have the collar turned up on his khaki shirt and he 'd have his shades on and a cigarette in his teeth , and he 'd say : " Nobody ever asked us how old we were in the Mekong Delta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men you must have killed With those looks that you go lookin ' at ' em with , When I think of all the good homes that you 've broke With those promises you 've whispered and you 've spoke Then I wonder why the Lord has gone and willed That a Hard-hittin ' Woman ai n't no myth.  --  from " Hard-hittin ' Woman , " a song by Elroy BluntAN APPROPRIATE TUNE TO BE FURNISHING backgroundmusic right now would be " Wore Out Mother , " one of Elroy Blunt 's first big ones . The point is , I 'm just a little bit tired after last night . It might have to be a wrap so far as my night life is concerned until after we 've dough-popped the dog-ass Jets . That place we were at , the Ho Chi Minh Trail , was what you might call semi-O.K. if what a man has on his mind is drinking and smoking and fooling around with goddess women . Cissy Walford ran about eighth and even Barbara Jane would have been caught in a photo finish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak hour in terms of sheer physical legs , lungs , asses , ankles and faces . Now if you think that 's not stronger than T. J. Lambert'sunderwear , then you can bust me . Only the Old Skipper in the great beauty pageant in the sky could have known who most of those young things were . Or how they came up so glorious . It was just a whole pile of have bosoms , will travel ; of long , tough legs ; of extra-long , serious hair ; and of soulful eyes. 96 PART TWO THE WOOL MARKET 97Barbara Jane said they were what you call your southern California witches . There is n't much to them , really , except physical stupendousness . They just sort of slouch around and toss their serious hair and do these slow dances by themselves , or with fags , with not too many clothes on . And if they speak at all , it is only something like , " Oh , hi . Did n't we meet at Screen Gems ? " We asked around who some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or semi-starlets or models , but you ca n't get any straight answers from people who live out here . For instance , one of the persons we asked was the Western TV star , Boke Kellum , who sat with us , much to Cissy Walford 's delight . And all Boke Kellum said was , " They 're all a bunch of silly pussies with hideous make-up . " Our general view was that the Ho Chi Minh Trail was a fairly nifty place , take away a few fags . When you walk in , you go down some steps into a trench up to your waist and you begin to hear the muffled sounds of explosions and gunfire . And it seemed like we also heard some kind of serious voice reciting the Declaration of Independence off in the distance . A fag spook in black pajamas comes up to you and asks if you 're a member or anybody important . Then he leads you to a bunker where people are laying around on sandbags . The trench winds all around the place , to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the dance floor where the southern California witches are . There are mosquito nets draped all around and everything is camouflaged in brown and yellow and green . It is sort of dark and there 's a small spotlight that stays pointed at a portrait on the wall of Ho Chi Minh . You do n't hear the music so much in the bunkers becauseof the muffled gunfire and explosions and the Declaration of Independence . But up on the dance floor , you can hear it because it comes down out of the ceiling , out of guns mounted on the wing of an American jet fighter plane that seems to be halfway poked through the ceiling . We thought the whole place smelled somewhat like grass . This might have been because Boke Kellum did n't see anything wrong with lighting up a few times and passing the little darlings around . The waitresses did n't seem to mind taking a hit or two , which tended to have some effect on the service . When I got to the bunker where my pals were , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . The first thing I saw was Boke Kellum sitting next to Cissy Walford . He stuck out his hand and said , " A real pleasure to meet a fellow athlete . I played a little football myself at Indiana State . " Like shit , I thought . He had a real tough handshake like he was testing the stud hoss 's grip , or trying to cover up the dicks he 's swallowed . Shake was propped up on a sandbag with his arm around Barbara Jane . " It 's our kind of place , Billy C. , " he said , nodding98 PART TWO up toward the dance floor where the southern California witches were . I looked up behind me and did n't see anything but a cluster of fantastic thighs and calves . " I see what you mean , " I said . Barbara Jane said , " You 'd better look a little closer . " I looked again . Well , sure enough , looking up there , if you looked close enough , you could plainly see that those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring down at all of us was lots and lots of slow- moving , southern California witch wool . " It do get distractin ' , do n't it ? " Barbara Jane grinned . I was beginning to wonder if I might have to burn a flag or something to get myself a young Scotch when I sensed something warm and damp in my ear and some- thing sort of nice pressing against my arm . " Are n't you Billy Clyde Puckett ? " the waitress asked . " Same one , " I said . " Your friends said you were coming , " she said . " They were right , " I said . She said , " Would you like something to drink , or would you rather just sit here and cuddle ? " I said I might like both . But I would start with a young Scotch and water . " Groovy , " she said . After which she pushed a whole blouse full of lungs against my arm and licked my ear again and left . I looked over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what that dumplin ' resembles in a better light ? " I asked . THE WOOL MARKET 99Shake said , " Pure Dirty Leg . " And Barbara Jane said , " Lower . " I said , " Ai n't no Runnin ' Sore , is it ? " " No , " Barbara Jane said . " But you would n't race off and buy a whole pack of Binaca . " I said , " Stove or Stovette ? " Shake said , " In-betweener . A semi-Stovette , Dirty Leg , Kid at Home . You would n't put her on your arm and go just anywhere . " Barbara Jane giggled . " That 's not to say you would n't eat her , " she said . A long time ago , way back in college at TCU , me and Shake and Barbara Jane to a certain extent had worked up this rating system for girls , or wool . Mostly , it was Shake 's terminology and we had never forgotten it . Anything below ten was a Running Sore . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lambert would fool around with , but of course either one of them would diddle an alligator if somebody drained the pond . From the bottom up , our rating system went like this : A Ten was a Healing Scab . Had a bad complexion , maybe , but was hung and could turn into some kind of barracuda in the rack . A Nine was a Head Cold . Good-looking but sort of proper and did n't know anything at all about what a man liked . An Eight was a Young Dose of the Clap , but pretty in a dimestore kind of way , and not bad for an hour . A Seven was just rich. 100 PART TWO A Six was a Stove or a Stovette . A Stove was over thirty and preferably married . A Stovette was just under thirty , divorced , talked filthy , and tried to make up for all the studs she never got to eat because she got married so young . A Five was a Dirty Leg . She wore lots of cheap wigs , waited tables or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , posed for pictures , and got most of her fun in groups . A Four was a Homecoming Queen or a Sophomore Favorite and a hard-hitting dumb-ass . Fours married insurance salesmen and got fat and later in life stayed sick a lot . A Three was a Semi , which a Texan pronounces sem- eye . You had to beware of Semis because you might marry them in a weak minute . Threes had it all put to- gether in looks and style and sophistication . They could drink a lot and dance good and hang around and make conversation . A Two was a Her . With a capital . If a Semi was tough , a Her was tougher . You might marry the same Her twice . Or three times . Barbara Jane was a Her , or a Two . And there just never had been a One . Ever . The day we made up the absolute grand majestic final list , we were sitting around Herb 's Cafe drinking Pearl . Barbara Jane knew quite a bit about what a One ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A One had to be extremely gorgeous in all ways from the minute she woke up in the morning until she fixed THE WOOL MARKET 101a man his cold meatloaf sandwich after love practice at four A.M.A One never got mad at anything a man might accidentallydo , no matter how thoughtless or careless it might be . A One did n't care about having a lot of money . A One had to be good-natured and laugh a lot and enjoy all kinds of people , no matter how boring they were . At least bores were funny , we said . Words like fuck and shit and piss and tit and fart and spick did n't bother a One . In fact , she used them , but not recklessly . Just natural . A One was a lady at all times . A One could cook anything a man wanted fixed , quickly , and good , such as biscuits and cream gravy , fried chicken , enchilladas , meatloaf , navy beans , tunafishsalad with pecans in it , barbecued ribs and strawberryshortcake . If a One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor but she never asked to dance . She ought to tan easily and not have any sort of blemish on her whole stud body . Hair color and eyes were optional but **25;14199;TOOLONG and deep brown eyes were n't too bad , since that was what Barbara Jane had , along with a semisleepylook and the ability to sweat daintily . A One had to know , Shake said . " Know what ? " Barbara Jane asked . " Whatever we want her to know at the time , " Shake said . " She just knows and understands . " 102 PART TWO A One was well-read and smart and witty but not as well-read and smart and witty as some guys she hung around with . It would help if a One had a great kind of laugh , sort of husky and boisterous at times , and highly appreciative of what a man said . A One was stylish in the way she dressed . Not fancy but semi-inventive . What she wore did n't detract from her physical beauty but made it better , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One did n't particularly care about ever getting married . She was a happy drunk and never aggressive . She was a talkative , funny high , but she probably preferred booze to dope . Finally , we decided , a One really and truly , and with- out any hangups , enjoyed every kind of normal sexual adventure under the proper circumstances . " Then she can come , " Barbara Jane joked . Shake said , " About every other time when she 's getting fucked , but just as regular as a faucet if you eat her . " Barbara Jane finished off a Pearl , took a long drag on a Winston , looked at me and Shake across the table and said , " I 'm a One . " I had a giggle fit for a while , and it was catching , and we all giggled through the ordering of another round of Pearl in Herb 's . And then Shake said , " Sorry . " " What do you mean sorry ? " said Barbara Jane . " Real close but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WOOL MARKET 103Barbara Jane looked at me . " Missed by that much , " I said . We were grinning . " I damn sure am , " she said . Shake said , " Nope . " I said , " You hit the tape at the same time . Probably both run a nine one . But you ai n't a One because there 's no such thing as a One that we know of . " Barbara Jane said , " Well , if I 'm not a One , then who in the hell is ? " " Nobody , " said Shake . Barbara Jane looked off for a while . And then she said , " I know who you all think is a One . You think that bitch Emily Kirkland is because she 's been to Europe and has her own Porsche . I do n't personally think she 's so good-looking . " We just laughed . " She 's got a thick waist , did you know that ? " Barbara Jane said . We did n't say anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily Kirkland is a One , then you two are just a couple of rat bastard pricks , " Barb said . Shake laughed like hell and so did I.Then Shake said , " Emily Kirkland is lighter than pop-corn . " I said , " Barb , you 're the only Two we ever knew . What 's wrong with that ? " Barbara Jane said , " What 's wrong with it is that I 'm a goddamn One . That 's what 's wrong with it . " Shake said , " I 'll tell you what we 'll do . We 'll give you104 PART TWO a one-week tryout as a possible One but if you flunk just one test , then you 're gon na have to be content as a Two forever . " " And if I pass ? " said Barb . " Well , the test do n't really ever come to an end , " said Shake . " A One can stop being a One almost any time . Like if she would change in any way and start putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So if you 're gon na get a One tryout , you 're gon na have to stay hook- ' em-up the rest of your life . Or not be a One , of course . " Barbara Jane said , " Since I 'm a natural One anyhow , I do n't imagine it 'll be too difficult . " Shake grinned and said , " I just thought of something . If you 're truly a One , then I do n't suppose you 'd mind doing me and Billy C. a favor right now , would you ? All you 'd have to do is get under the table for a few minutes . " Barbara Jane said , " Gee , it would sure be fun , guys . Right here in Herb 's . But as a One , of course , I have to be well-read and smart and witty . So I got ta go to class . " She slid out of her chair , stood up , and swallowed the last of her can of Pearl . " See you around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say ? " she said . Going toward the side door of Herb 's , she stopped to say hello to old Herb , who was behind the bar . " Listen , Herb , " she said . " There 's a couple of fur traders sitting over there who just blew in from the Yukon . Set ' em up with some of the good liquor . I 'll be back after I do my next song and dance . " Then she slinked out , like one of those old dolls in one of those old movies . THE WOOL MARKET 105Shake and me and old Herb , from across the small bar-type room where we were at , all shared a mutual grin for Barbara Jane Bookman . We sat silent for a minute and Shake said , " You think I 'm not about half in love with that sumbitch ? " " Always were , " I said . We kept on sitting there , sort of looking out the window at the parking lot , and across the street at the Esso station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever knew . " " Stronger than rent , " I said . Shake said , " I guess I really do love her , do n't I ? " I said , " Old buddy , any time you decide that you do n't , I know an old boy who 'd like to try out for the part . " And Shake said , " Hell , Billy C. , if you did n't love old Barb too , then you and me would n't have anything at all in common . We would n't even be fur-trading partners in the Yukon . " The name of that waitress dumpling at the Ho Chi Minh Trail was Carlene . I found that out after she brought me three or four young Scotches and let me check out her lungs to make sure they were real . When my eyes had got used to the dark in there , I found out that Puddin Patterson and Rosalie were in the bunker with us , except they were asleep . I would have known they were there at first if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could have seen their teeth in the dark . Things get into a man 's mind when he sits in a place like that and looks up at a whole pile of southern Cali-106 PART TWO fornia witch wool and also has a Dirty Leg licking on his ear and pressing her lungs against him . Cissy Walford did n't seem to mind it too much since she was busy talking to Boke Kellum about the fascinating world of show business . I hesitate to talk much about what eventually happened last night . I 'm afraid we had us one of those occasions that me and Shake normally reserve for our New York apartment after a home game . We all came back to me and Shake 's palatial suite here at the Beverly Stars Hotel and eventually worked ourselves into a group portrait . I guess Rosalie Patterson might have been the rookie star of the night after Puddin went to sleep . Boke Kellum did n't do anything but watch , which figured . Barbara Jane was only involved to a physical extent where Shake was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody with her NFL body . And she kept Cissy from getting too mad about the fact that Carlene was a bit of a hog . Carlene , by the way , was everything we hoped she would be , a semi-wild sumbitch . She sure knew how to spread the wealth around , even as far as Rosalie . They did a duet on the vibrators . I 've got to say that Rosalie was an awful good sport when it came to playing some of Shake 's favorite games , such as Unhitch the Box Car , Flaming Cartwheel , Den- mark Love Book and Down Range Target Practice . I 'm sure glad Puddin was asleep . Barbara Jane remembered something funny in the middle of one of our better heaps . THE WOOL MARKET 107She said she thought she 'd seen this kind of thing beforein a magazine called Climax , back in the fifth grade . " Let 's get Miss Lewis on the phone , " Barb said . Miss Lewis was one of our fifth-grade teachers , and she had once caught all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our book reports on Babe Ruth or somebody . Barb told Miss Lewis that day , " I do n't see how people can eat things like that without catchup and fries . " And me and Shake laughed so hard and fell down so many times we broke a desk . I guess Barb was born funny and semi-grown up . We did n't get expelled or anything that time back in elementary school . Miss Lewis was ashamed to show the picture to the principal . She wanted to keep it , I think . Miss Lewis was n't so bad for a teacher , and the miniskirtsshe wore suggested that she might have had a little bit of hell in her . Anyhow , we had us a semi-skate last night , is what we did . We got some of the crescendos on tape , but I do n't think they 'll be any good for the book , Jim Tom . It 's just a lot of laughing and semi-ecstasy words that nobody can spell . Man , you can always tell when it 's getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Ed Bookmanto Hitler 's nephews start asking for extra tickets that do n't exist . Here it is Thursday , and between our meeting of the offense this morning and our practice at UCLA this108 PART TWOafternoon , I guess I got five calls for tickets . There 'll probably be some more while I 'm writing this . Downstairs in the lobby and in the bars , it is getting awfully crowded with Giant fans who have flown out for the big day . Shake and Barbara Jane are down there with Big Ed and Big Barb , who have just arrived . Cissy Walford is n't back yet from going to a studio to watch Boke Kellum kill another fag in an episode of his TV series , which is called McGill of Santa Fe . All we have to do tonight is something fairly quiet , thank the Lord . We have to stop by a cocktail party that CBS is having here in the hotel and then go to early dinner with Big Ed and Big Barb . Big Ed and Big Barb do n't normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Big Ed 's Firestream Two , his six-seater jet , and flog it in on Saturday night and then flog it back to Fort Worth on Sunday night in time for some drinks and boring talk at River Crest . But since this is our first Super Bowl , Big Ed thought it was a special enough occasion that he and Big Barb had to be on hand early so he could tell us how to whip the dog-ass Jets . There is n't anything that Big Ed does n't know all about , especially football . I think that if he had a loose sixty million that he was n't " puttin ' in the ground , " as he says , he would buy the Giants from DDD and F just so he could sit on the bench and fire Shoat Cooper . Which would n't be so bad an idea , to fire Shoat . THE WOOL MARKET 109Big Ed thinks the only reason we 're undefeated this season is because of the inside tips he 's given us . Big Ed 's idea of strategy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw at the other side 's niggers . Me and Shake have bust our butts laughing at some of Big Ed 's serious ideas about football . This is how Shake imitates Big Ed discussing football : " Now if the other side has a fast goddamn nigger , you 've got to get to him early in the game . Hit that black bastard a good lick on his big toe and he wo n't run so fast . " Never give the ball to a nigger on third and three when you 're behind and need the yardage . Goddamn it , they 'll dog it on you ever time . It 's too bad they 've been raised that way , in Africa and Brazil and Philadelphia and Detroit and everywhere , but that 's the way it is . One of these days when they 've educated themselves better and shown some goddamn initiative at inventing things like  --  oh , I do n't know , the offshore rig or the diamond drillin ' bit , or something useful  --  then goddamn it , you can give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now . " I just would n't trust a nigger to make a big play for me any more than I 'd trust a spick to fix a flat tire . " Uh , little lady , I 'll have one of your sixteen-ounce T-bones , medium rare . " Shake and me have pointed out to Big Ed that there are some fairly stud spooks on the Giants , such as Puddin Patterson and Sam Perkins and Euger Franklin in the offensive line , and Henry Knight and Perry Lou Jackson110 PART TWO THE WOOL MARKET 111and Varnell Swist and Jimmy Keith Joy and Story Time Mitchell on defense , not to forget Randy Juan Llanez , our all-purpose stud who returns kicks , fills in at cornerback and behind Shake Tiller at split end , and is all kinds of mixed-up spook and spick blood . Big Ed has said , however , " There are some goddamn exceptions to everything and as far as I 'm concerned those boys are damn near as white as us because they 've paid the price . " Speaking of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Big Ed the Brain Trust thinks , this seems like a good time for me to go through our line-up and tell you a little something about each stud that you might find interesting . I enjoy talking about these studs , anyhow , because I 'm proud of what we 've accomplished , both as a team and as what you might call your human beings . At tight end , of course , we 've got old Thacker Hubbardwho just walked into camp one day . He 'd been drafted and cut by Detroit and nobody wanted him . Granted , he 's slow . But he 'll catch it if Hose Manning does n't make him reach too far , and he can block . Thacker keeps to himself and does his job . He 's from Idaho and likes sheep . He 's about six three and two thirty-five . Seems like Thacker said something funny back during the season but I ca n't remember what it was . Sam Perkins is an offensive tackle on the right side of the line . Sam is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole lot of effort . He 's about sixfeet and two fifty and he 's been around long enough to know every kind of secret way there is to hold on a pass block . Sam played college ball at Oregon State but he comes from Los Angeles . That 's where he lives in the off-season , somewhere around here , like Compton . He 's got a real good off-season business designing women 's clothes , they tell me . Some people say Sam might like boys better than girls , and that 's why he 's never been married , but I hesitate to believe something like this about a friend . Anyway , I do n't see how the Lord would make somebodyan interior lineman , and black , and a fag . Puddin Patterson is our right guard on offense , as you already know , and of course Puddin is simply one of the all-time immortals . He must be the fastest big man that ever was , and he 's such a good buddy that if I ask Puddin to kill somebody for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want this cat 's body shipped ? " Because I like country music so much , Puddin calls me his " closet red neck , " but he knows I love his big ass , and Rosalie , and his two little cousins , too . Through our connections , me and Shake helped Puddinget a beer distributorship in Lafayette , Louisiana , where he 's from , and we also put his mamma in the piemakingbusiness , in which she is about to get semi-rich . One of the things I think me and Shake will do one of these days when Puddin retires from pro ball is give his old school , Grambling , a ten-thousand-dollar scholarshipin his name. 112 PART TWO THE WOOL MARKET 113Puddin says that wo n't make up for the fact that we 're white . He says , " You cats know how much better ball you 'd play if you did n't feel so much guilt ? " We tell Puddin to go play the saxophone , or whatever it is spades do . At center we 've got a peculiar old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monk 's haircut , no front teeth , real white skin and a cross eye . Everybody calls him the Pope and he kind of grins . The Pope goes about six four and two sixty and one of the fascinating things he can do  --  for money  --  is drink a can of beer in four seconds . He just sucks it out in a giant inhale . The Pope broke in as a rookie last year , and I 'm sure he would have made All-Pro if he had n't beaten up a sports writer from Chicago when we were out there playingthe Bears . It was on Saturday night before the game and some of us were in Adolph 's having dinner and some drinks when the sports writer saw us and came over to our booth and started kidding the Pope about Notre Dame losing to Tulane . The sports writer found out that only two things make the Pope mad . One is the guy he 's blocking on , and the other is a joke about Notre Dame football . The Pope vaulted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth and grabbed the sports writer and lifted him up in the air by his neck . He held him up in the air near the piano bar and slapped him a few times , growling through the meat in his mouth . Then he took the poor old sports writer out on the sidewalk , right there on Rush Street , turned him upside down and shook him . He took the guy 's money and threw it down the street , and took the guy 's glasses and ate them . He just chewed all the glass out of the rims and swallowed it , growling some more , and went back in Adolph 's and washed it down with some beer . We got him calmed down and the Pope just sat there the rest of the night and said , " Fuckin ' literary fuckers . " The sports writer did n't press any charges . In fact , he wrote what I thought was a funny story in the paper the next day about how to interview Nobakov Korelovich . What I mainly remember was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a blue-gray October sky , the Four Horsemen rode again last night . You remember them . Pestilence , Famine , War and Korelovich . " Our other offensive guard is Euger Franklin . Euger is from Nebraska and he 's about as close as anything we 've got to what some people might call a troublemaker . There 's no worry about Euger in a football game . He 's a strong-shouldered old boy with a hell of a physique and he 's quick as a turpentined cat . He weighs about two forty and stands about six one . Shoat Cooper refers to Euger as his " malcontent . " Since I 've been around Euger , which is roughly three seasons , he has n't been overly friendly with the white114 PART TWOstuds on the team . He never hangs around with any of us , even when there are other spooks in the crowd . Even Puddin Patterson , who sort of keeps Euger cool . Euger is about the only spade on the team that you would n't get too funny with , in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because actually he 's a lot lighter than the rest . Euger , in fact , could damn near pass as a Mexican or an A-rab . Euger was a No. 1 draft choice of the Giants , and also an All-American and a Lineman of the Year at Nebraska . He 's married to a good-looking chick named Eunice , who 's not a bad blues singer and who 's been in the movies . He makes good money with the Giants . He 's probably the highest-paid lineman we 've got , next to Puddin . Or maybe higher , considering the bonus he got . But Euger Franklin 's been right there with every kind of spook movement that 's gone on in the league . Like the white-shoe movement , which was when all the spooks decided they would only wear white game shoes . Things like that . Shake Tiller somehow gets away with kidding him . A little bit . Like today at practice . We were working on a tricky reverse where Euger has to fake a pass block , then circle out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety . We ran it four or five times and messed up the handoffs , and Euger , meanwhile , was going downfield and coming back . THE WOOL MARKET 115He just walked off and sat down , pissed . Shoat Cooper strolled over to him and said something and Euger said something back , waving his arms , and standing up and kicking his helmet . Puddin hollered at him , " Hey , boy . You get that mean and we 'll whip them cats on Sunday . " Euger took a few steps back toward our unit , cupped his hands , and shouted at Hose Manning . He shouted : " Say , baby . Why do n't you let those cats back there fair-catch those handoffs , you dig ? " Shake Tiller grinned and so did Hose Manning . And Shake called to him : " Come on , Euger . Get your white ass over here . Alittle extra running ca n't hurt anybody as mean as you . " Euger said , " I do n't get paid to take laps , baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Euger , " said Hose Manning . " Let 's work , gang . Here we go . " And Hose whistled loudly and clapped his hands . Euger Franklin started walking to the huddle , slowly , talking to himself . " Tell you what , Euger , " said Shake . " When that big black tribunal takes over , your trouble-makin ' ass is gon na be the first one they execute . " Euger fastened his chin strap and spit . We ran the play a few more times and Euger dug out harder than anybody . Our other offensive tackle is just a big old country boy named Dean McCoobry from the University of Texas . He 's a rookie who has n't said anything that I know of116 PART TWO THE WOOL MARKET 117since training camp when we made him try to sing " The Eyes of Texas " every night after dinner until he got the words right . The first time he sang it was just about the funniest thing I 've ever heard . Dean 's idea of the tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The eyesOf Texas were uponit . Allthe lifelong thing . The eyesOf Texas were because , ifThey thrilled meall their days . DoNot think you can despise it , From nowTil every afternoon . The eyesOf Texas went behind themTil Garland goes back yet . Of course , nobody ever said an offensive tackle had tobe able to sing or know the lyrics to his school song . Heknows our plays , which is good enough . And he canblow me through a hole for five and six yards at a pop . Dean 's six five and about two fifty-five , he 's got buckteeth , wears glasses off the field , and has a bit of a puzzledlook on his semi-baby face . We call him Baby Dean , and he collects match folders . Our split end is Marvin ( Shake ) Tiller , of whom you may have heard me speak . Shake Tiller . Pimp . Sex maniac . Dope fiend . Wanted for manslaughter in Joplin , Missouri . We have a flanker who ca n't do much except outrun everybody , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Al ( Abort ) Goodwin , the ex-Olympic hurdler . I 'll tell you . If you ever need anybody to run three and a half miles over brush and timber , you 'd better get Al ( Abort ) Goodwin . On a straight line , I do n't think there 's any doubt that Al Goodwin could outrun anybody in football . The thing he gives us is the deep threat . Real deep . Al runs so fast down the sideline that he very often gets sixty or seventy yards gone on a single pattern , but of course Hose Manning just ca n't throw it that far . Still , the defense has to assign one man to Al , basically on the chance that Hose will try to hit him once a game , he 'll underthrow , and the defensive back can intercept . It must have been two seasons ago that Al Goodwin caught his touchdown pass against Philadelphia . I rememberHose had the wind . Al ( Abort ) Goodwin is a real nice fellow who lives in Boulder , Colorado , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has four kids . He 's never seen a day of the year when he did n't run some laps , or do some sprints , even in the snow . He usually flies in on Sundays for our games , wherever118 PART TWO we are , and just suits up and goes out and runs his side- line sprints on every play . He does n't really have to know the offense . Al will probably be getting in here tomorrow , or the next day . Long before now I should have mentioned our full- back , the guy who takes over some of my ball-carrying duties now and then and does a fine job of pass-blocking for Hose Manning . Our fullback is Booger Sanders from Alabama , and he 's one of the best sumbitches who ever breathed air . In the eight years he 's been up from Tuscaloosa , Booger 's had a lot of bad luck with his career . He 's had every physical thing happen to him from a broken back to the clap . Two wives have just hauled off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he 's run under more than one tackler in his day . This is the first season that things have gone smooth for him . No injuries . And he 's come up with a nice girl friend who might not rob him . She 's a cashier in the first Howard Johnson 's you come to on the Jersey Turnpike after you go through the Lincoln Tunnel . Booger likes to drive her home after work every night . I think she lives in Hartford . Booger 's prematurely bald and he 's starting to get a belly on him , but he can still scoot , and there just is n't an ounce of give-up in him . Now we come to a fellow I just ca n't say enough about . This is our cerebral leader , Mr. Quarterback himself , THE WOOL MARKET 119otherwise known as Hose Manning . Shoat Cooper calls Hose Manning " the best milker on the farm , " meaning he 's the best quarterback in pro ball . I agree . It 's a known fact that a football team ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my five years with the Giants we did n't really start going anywhere until we got Hose from the Vikings . That was two years ago . We got Hose from Minnesota after a turn of very sinisterevents that spring . We got Hose because the Vikings thought he would never be able to play ball again after he was in a terrible car wreck back in his home town of Purcell , Oklahoma . The story behind the trade is semi-fascinating and I think I 'll reveal it . It would make a damn movie is all it would do . Hose had gone home to Purcell , like he always does in the off-season . He 'd gone home to look after his chain of filling stations . Purcell is a little town near Norman , which is where the University of Oklahoma is . Purcell is also where they have the annual Old Fiddlers ' Conventionand Contest . The Old Fiddlers ' Convention and Contest is an event where old fiddle players from everywhere gather for a few days and fiddle their asses off . Down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week was Tom Stinnywade , the Vikings ' chief scout . One day Stinnywade had nothing else to do but drive over to Purcell to hear some of the old120 PART TWO THE WOOL MARKET 121fiddlers who were having their contest at the same time as Oklahoma 's spring practice . By a strange coincidence Stinnywade happened to be passing along the highway just outside of Purcell at the exact time that Hose Manning 's Cadillac got hit from the blind side by one of those old yellow-dog school buses . You 've seen those old yellow-dog buses . The kind with the straight back seats . The kind junior college teams go to games in , and throw Kentucky Fried Chicken bones out the windows of . When Hose 's car got hit , it turned over two or three times , they say , and rattled all the dishes in Grayford 's Truck Stop Diner on the other side of the street . Tom Stinnywade actually saw the crash , hopped out of his own car , ran over and saw Hose laying on the ground , unconscious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . Instead of seeing how bad Hose was hurt , Stinnywade ran into Grayford 's Truck Stop Diner and called the front office in Minneapolis and got hold of Herb Fannerbahn , the Vikings ' general manager . " Trade Manning , " Stinnywade said . Or something like that . Now the plot thickens . Herb Fannerbahn phoned up Burt Danby in New York and asked him if the Giants had found a quarterbackyet . Burt obviously said no . Fannerbahn asked if Burt would like to have Hose Manning . For the Giants ' first four draft choices ? Burt Danby is sometimes not so stupid and he put Herb Fannerbahn on hold and said he 'd get back to him within an hour . Burt then phoned up Shoat Cooper , who was down on his ranch near Lubbock , Texas . The Vikings want to give us Manning , Burt said , but there must be something wrong . Could Shoat find out what it was ? It just so happened that Shoat Cooper had a friend in Purcell that he could call . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shoat had done some scouting in his day and like most scouts he knew every beer joint and truck stop and waitress in America . Shoat called up Louise the Tease and asked her if she had heard anything about Hose Manning lately ? " All I know is what I can see out the window right now , " said Louise the Tease , " which is Hose Manning layin ' in a ditch . " Shoat asked Louise the Tease to do him a big favor , like run across the street and see if Hose was alive , and , if so , did he have all his arms and legs and hands , and , possibly , could he call an audible ? " I 'll go see , " said Louise the Tease . " But personally I would n't give you two cents for him . He taken somethingfrom between my thighs once and now he do n't never come around . " Louise the Tease called Shoat back in less than five minutes and said Hose seemed to be all right . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that would make his crotch feel better. 122 PART TWO THE WOOL MARKET 123Shoat phoned this news to Burt Danby , who im- mediately phoned up Herb Fnnerbahn and made the trade . And that 's how we got our milker . I do n't know whatever happened to Tom Stinnywade . Last I heard he was an assistant coach in a vocational high school on Chicago 's south side . And Herb Fanner- bahn is a tour guide now at Hoover Dam , I think . Hose Manning fit right in with us , of course . He not only gave us the arm we needed but he 's a fine punter and field goal kicker . A real all-around stud who nearly won the Reisman Trophy when he played for OU . Hose is a tough leader . And he 's not bad-looking for a guy with an Oklahoma face . He 's got deep creases in his face and what 's left over from a childhood case of semi-acne . He 's got black , stringy hair , and he 's about the only quarterback left who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighs about two hundred . He 's got a quick release and he throws what we call a light ball . The nose is up and it 's easy to catch . The only thing Hose lost in that wreck was one kid- ney . But like he says , " If I 'd lost it earlier in life , think how much less I 'd had to piss . " As for our defensive unit , I do n't know so many per- sonal things about very many of those studs , other than T. J. Lambert . In pro ball the offense and defense are like two separate clubs . We never work together . The defense is always down on the other end of the field figuring out its own problems . Shoat Cooper 's number one assistant is an old fellow named Morgan Bujakowski and he handles the defense . Shoat calls Bujakowski " 01 ' Army " because he played at both West Point and Texas A &M.; during World War II . Most of the players call him the star-spangled Polack because he 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wears an old Aggie cavalry hat to practice . The star-spangled Polack likes to kick players in the butt and tell us that we do n't know what real football is . He says face-guards have taken fear out of the game . What I 'll do , I think , is just run through the defensive line-up for you , sort of quick . T. J. Lambert of course is on one end , and you 've alreadygotten acquainted with that great American poet . On the opposite end we 've got F. Tolan Gates , who 's from Stanford . He 's a good fellow whose family is about half-rich . At one defensive tackle we 've got Henry Knight from Arkansas AM &N,; which the star-spangled Polack once said stood for Agricultural , Mechanical and Nig'ger . The other tackle is Rucker McFarland from North Carolina State , who met his wife on a float in the Peach Bowl parade . That 's our down four . Our three linebackers are Perry Lou Jackson , Salter Bingham and Harris Jones . Perry Lou 's from Texas Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , Bad Hair Jackson . He got famous a couple of years ago for killing four prison guards at Huntsville. 124 PART TWOSalter Bingham played at UCLA and his sister was a well-known actress named Stephanie something . Harris Jones comes from Michigan State , where some people might recall that he was better known as a basketball player . In the secondary I 'd guess that we 've got more speed than a bunch of hookers at a convention . Jimmy Keith Joy and Story Time Mitchell give us the two toughest corners in pro ball , I think . Jimmy Keith Joy is from Kansas State and Story Time Mitchell is a rookie from Purdue whose whole life got changed by football . In the spring of his junior year at Purdue , Story Time Mitchell got caught being a lookout on a grocery market holdup . The school decided , however , that it would n't be a good thing for an All-American , which he was , to have to go to jail . And the team voted that he ought to get to stay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that way he could also keep returningpunts and intercepting passes . This has just reminded me that when I made one of my best runs this season against St. Louis , Jim Tom Pinch called me up that night to tell me he 'd seen it on TV and that during the run when I side-stepped two tacklers I had made " the greatest move since Story Time Mitchell went from armed robbery to probation . " Story Time Mitchell has played real good for the Giants and stayed pretty much out of trouble with the law , although his roommate on the road , Perry Lou Jackson , says , " It sure is a lot of trouble all the time to have to take a shower with your money in your hand . " THE WOOL MARKET 125This leaves only our free safety and our on-safety and they happen to be absolute streaks named Varnell Swist and Bobby Styles . Varnell Swist is from San Diego State and I do n't think there 's a better free safety in football . And Bobby Styles is from LSU , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they say , the radio stationsstill play a recording of Bobby 's great run which beat Ole Miss a couple of years ago . The radio stations play Bobby 's run every fifteen minutesall day long before a Saturday night game . Shoat Cooper likes to kid Bobby and tell him , " I do n't see how you can be any kind of coon ass legend when you ai n't got no x 's or u 's in your name . " Shoat means of course that everybody from LSU seems to have a name like Bou-ax and Loubedo . Well , this just about takes care of everybody importanton our team , except for Randy Juan Llanez , our utility stud . All I can say about Randy Juan is that he comes from somewhere in South America , played college ball at Florida State , and says he learned to run fast in riots after soccer games . So there they are , folks , the New York Giants . Get ' em , Giants . Cissy Walford came in a while ago and she 's getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner with Big Ed and Big Barb , so I am doing some more work . She said everybody in the whole world was in the hotel lobby . This means there are six or seven people126 PART TWO THE WOOL MARKET 127 down there that she knows from around midtown New York . She said Burt Danby was down there with Camille Virl , the movie queen , and he was really having fun in- troducing her around . She said Shake was signing a lot of autographs around the table he was at with Big Ed and Big Barb in the Eucalyptus Bar , just off the lobby . She said some photographers were there and they were setting up a picture of Shake and Camille Virl when Boke Kellum rushed up and hugged Camille Virl in the middle of the photograph , and got himself in it . She said several writers were hanging around , getting funny statements from Shake about the game . And here she comes now , folks , right out of heaven , as I 'm talking into the old tape recorder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she did at the Sports Illustrated party . All I can see from here are these elegant thighs and that long yellow hair streaming down off an angel 's face . Get over here , woman . As T. J. Lambert once said , " Psycho wants pussy . " Well , this is Friday morning , friends , and this is Billy Clyde Puckett , the disk jockey 's disk jockey . I 'm here to wake you up with tunes of pleasure and semi-sadness as sung by that merry philosopher Elroy Blunt . Here 's our first tune by Elroy . It 's titled " Watch Old Billy Clyde Brush His Teeth and Throw Up . " Now I 'm back from doing my household chores . Washing my face and hands and teeth and body parts and all . Everybody else is still racked in and I guess I 'm up early because this is Friday and it will be our last serious workout of the week . I believe I 'm getting my game-face on . We wo n't do anything tomorrow , Saturday , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We probably wo n't even look at any more film after late this afternoon because Shoat Cooper has already said , " The hunt 's over . It 's time to piss on the fire and call in the dogs . " This of course has not been an ordinary week in terms of how we prepare for a football game . If this were just a regular season game , the week would go sort of like this : nothing on Monday , see the film breakdown of last Sunday 's game on Tuesday , run through our entire repertoire on Wednesday , set the draws and screens on Thursday , light-polish on Friday , rest the legs on Saturday , and then kick the pee out of somebody else on Sunday . This being the Super Bowl , it 's different . We 've had two weeks to get ready since we doughpoppedthe LA Rams for the National Conference championship back in good old Yankee Stadium . We had a three-day rest and victory celebration after that because it was such a colossal thing that the Giants won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except a few coin flips . Then we started boning up on the dog-ass Jets , who had dusted off Oakland thirty-five to ten for the AmericanConference title . Dreamer Tatum broke two Oak-128 PART TWO THE WOOL MARKET 129land jaws in the game and personally caused six limpoffs . Ten days before the Super Bowl we left New York and went to Rancho La Costa , which is near La Jolla and San Diego . Shoat Cooper worked it out for us to go to Rancho La Costa and do our hard preparations . It was warm there , and , besides , Shoat knows a cocktail waitress there who is sort of a Stove but she likes coaches . We got here to the Beverly Stars Hotel last Monday , pretty much ready to play a ball game . We know what to do . It 's only a matter of polish , timing and execution . And , anyhow , the last few days before a Super Bowl are given over to talking and interviews and mental health . What the dog-ass Jets did was stay back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got their asses caught in several blizzards and ice storms and had to practice in Madison Square Garden in the mornings . Rudi Tambunga , the coach of the dog-ass Jets , was quoted in the papers as saying that if he had it to do over again he would take his team to Fiji . They got out here Tuesday on their charter jet after what I read was a fairly hectic flight . First , they had to sit on the ground for seven hours at La Guardia because of the blizzard . And then when they arrived , the smog was so heavy that a small private plane nicked them in the wing tip on their approach . Nothing real bad happened on the landing , however , except for some minor burns to the pilot . The collision , they say , caused him to spill coffee on one of his handsand drop a lighted cigarette in his lap . The papers have been full of a lot of junk about the trip out here taking something out of the dog-ass Jets , but nobody can fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jets are professionals and I have plenty of respect for them , both as athletes and as people . Physically and technically , they have been completely rebuilt since the Mastrioni brothers , Angie and Tony , took over the team and hired Rudi Tambunga for a coach . I know that everybody said they would n't make a comeback after Joe Namath retired a few years ago , but they 've had some good drafts and made some stud trades . One of the slickest moves the Mastrioni brothers made four years ago was getting the dog-ass Jets to lose their last five games so they could finish last in the whole NFL and be allowed to draft Dreamer Tatum . In case nobody knows it , the last-place team gets the first draft pick . I heard a story that the dog-ass Jets cele- brated their final loss to the Patriots in Shea Stadium by carrying their quarterback , Boyce Cayce , off the field because he had thrown four interceptions for touch- downs . " This is a great bunch of guys , " the papers quoted Rudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch that wants the first-round draft pick as much as the management does . " After the dog-ass Jets got Dreamer Tatum , they made a stud trade with Dallas and got Jessie Luker and Gruver130 PART TWOAllgood to pep up the offense . Jessie Luker is a hot dog from Alcorn A &M; who 's got hands on him like snowshoes . Instead of his name on his jersey across the back , he 's got " See You Later " stitched on there for guys to read when they 're chasing him . In the regular season he caught the most balls of anybodyother than Shake Tiller . Why Dallas gave up on Gruver Allgood has baffled a lot of people . He only gained a thousand thirty-five yards last season for the Cowboys and took them to the Super Bowl , where they lost down in Mexico City to the Chiefs , fifty-six to three . Gruver was popular in Dallas despite his two arrests on sodomy . And that scandal he got into when he got caught stealing women 's underwear off the clotheslines in backyards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog-ass Jets , and he 's stayed fairly clean in New York . There 's another old boy who makes the dog-ass Jets what they are and that 's Boyce Cayce . I do n't think he 's any Hose Manning but you 'd have to put Boyce in your top half of quarterbacks around the league . The sports writers have been calling him " the grand old man " for several years although he 's never played on a great team until now . Boyce started out with the Rams about twelve years ago , I guess , and since then he 's been with the Redskins , Saints , Oilers , Raiders , Browns , Bears , Dolphins , Chiefs and Broncos . The dog-ass Jets got him four years ago and he sortTHE WOOL MARKET 131of became a different person . Rudi Tambunga has handled Boyce real good . They say Boyce has cut down a lot on his fights in bars . He has n't stolen a city bus in a long time . You do n't hear so much about his drinking in public or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality of the dog-ass Jets . Some say they 're about half-rowdy , off the field . They 've always been cocky . As I 've said , I do n't know any of them too well because they mostly live in Queens and low-rent places like that and they hang out in bowling alleys , or somewhere . I think you 'd have to say that Rudi Tambunga is the dominant personality of the whole outfit . He 's a natty little man who always wears a gray felt hat with a wide brim , a black shirt and silver tie , and a striped suit . Tambunga calls all of their plays during a game ; all but the ones that Boyce Cayce rejects because he has n't learned them . Tambunga hangs around lower New York City and you can nearly always see him in a restaurant on MulberryStreet sitting with his back to the wall . The name of the place is Paloggia 's and it is popular with Italians when it is n't being blown up . Rudi Tambunga is very thick with the owners of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somebody once told me they all grew up together in Newark . I do know that Rudi Tambunga introduced both Angie and Tony to their present wives , April Mastrioni and132 PART T W O THE WOOL MARKET 133Dawn Mastrioni . Not bad lookers for Vegas shills , in fact . I saw them once at Jimmy Weston 's on Fifty-fourth Street when all of them were having dinner and entertainingDreamer Tatum before they signed him . Weston 's is kind of a supper club for horse players . The wives , April and Dawn , were sitting on either side of Dreamer and whispering in his ear . Angie and Tony and Rudi Tambunga were whispering to each other . I was there with Shake and Barbara Jane , and when Barb saw the Mastrioni wives in their stacked-up amber hair and their stacked-up lungs and their dark glasses and their white fur coats around their shoulders , she said , " It 's One and One-A . " We decided it would be polite to go say hello . This was our first introduction to Dreamer Tatum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smiled . But nobody else looked up at us . I think I said something like , " Hope you come up here . It 's not a bad town . " Without even looking at us , Tony Mastrioni said , " It 's the only town . " We would have stood around exchanging pleasantries a while longer except that either April or Dawn peered at us over the top of her dark glasses through a stream of cigarette smoke and said , " You could do us all a very sincere favor if you 'd fuck off . " We laughed and went back to the bar up front and Barb said , " I kind of like her . I think I 'll put her up for the Junior League . " It seems everybody is waking up now . Me and Shake have a meeting to go to , and then that luncheon at the Century Plaza , and then our last workout . Later I 'll tell you about last night 's dinner and the CBS party . Semi-hilarious is all they were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a Friday night in January in Beverly Hills , California . It is about forty-eight hours until the minute when the gun sounds to end the Super Bowl and the New York Giants will be champions of the world in professional football . I have marked the time on my old East-West Shrine Game wrist watch , which is laying on the toilet seat while I am enjoying a lemon-lime bubble bath in the bathroom of me and Shake 's palatial suite in the Beverly Stars Hotel . Shake is enjoying a boysenberry-blackberry bubble bath in his own bathroom of his own bedroom of our palatial suite . We have come back from our last stud workout and from that low-rent lunch at the Century Plaza where nothing happened except that Dreamer Tatum had to get up and make a short talk about me and I had to get up and make a short talk about him . Some phony fuckin ' emcee thought that stunt up . Dreamer said , " I respect Billy Puckett as the best running back in the National Conference ( he would n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow him down some on Sunday . " I got up and said , " Obert Tatum has proved he 's the134 PART TWO best cornerback in the game . I say this with all due respect to my good buddies sitting down there who play for us  --  our own stud hosses at corner , which are Story Time Mitchell and Jimmy Keith Joy . " I also said , " I want to say , too , that as the captain of the Giants it is a real thrill for us to be here in the Super Bowl . " And I said , " So far as the game itself is concerned , I do n't know what 's liable to happen . Probably a big break one way or another will decide it . But I do know this . Our side is ready . " I was real flattered that when I said that , all of the New York Giants stood up and clapped . It made me feel good and warm inside to see our men do that , although it also embarrassed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the dog-ass Jets giggling and whispering to each other . Later on at workout at UCLA , I thought I had some real spring in my legs , and I thought Shake looked slick catching balls from Hose Manning . I really do believe we 're ready . I have forgotten to say where Barbara Jane and Cissy are . They are in the living room of our palatial suite , as it happens , entertaining a whole mess of folks , including Big Ed and Big Barb , and Burt Danby , and some televi- sion people , and Boke Kellum . And there is an ugly rumor circulating that Elroy Blunt his own self is due in tonight . Our plan is to stay around the hotel tonight and not THE WOOL MARKET 135exert ourselves too much , just like we will tomorrow and tomorrow night . I guess a lot of people will be dropping by our palatial suite during the evening . Me and Shake have told Barbara Jane to order plenty of everything to eat and drink for everybody . All I know is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na lay here in his lemon-lime bubble bath and write on his book and relax . Maybe Cissy Walford will drop a young Scotch on me from time to time . Now about last night . We started out at the CBS cocktail party , which was semi-massive . That was perhaps the high point because that 's where T. J. Lambert did his number . The party was held in the Senor Sombrero Cafe on the second floor of the hotel . It was a big L-shaped restaurantroom , all glassed-in with a view of all of the smog from Sunset Boulevard down to little Santa Monica . It had a terrace outside the sliding glass walls , which hung out over one of the hotel swimming pools . It used to be that players did n't go to parties like this because there was drinking and the coaches and the old commissioner , Pete Rozelle , frowned on it . CommissionerCameron , however , took a more modern view when he came into office on the forty-eighth ballot . He said players were going to drink anyhow and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way maybe they would drink less . THE WOOL MARKET 137Coming back to the hotel , however , T. J. was driving and he started going across people 's front yards and scraping the car off the sides of office buildings on the sidewalks . Two squad cars finally hemmed us in on a neighborhoodstreet . Fortunately the cops recognized us and put away their guns and offered to escort us back to our hotel and not say anything about it . But just as we had it smoothed over , T. J. Lambert farted two or three times real loud , and hollered : " They 's a number of things in the world that 's overratedand one of ' em is how tough a goddamn cop is . " Then he said , " I believe I 'll make me a sandwich out of these sixty-dollar-a-week motherfuckers . " And he did . He sure did . The Giants and the Cowboys got together and kept our arrest quiet . We got to play in the game . I think the Giants had to give up a high draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best testimony I can give as to how mean and tough old T. J. is has to do with a hunting trip some of us went on last year . Several of us went out on Big Ed Bookman 's farm near Fort Worth one day to shoot birds . We killed birds all day and then we built a fire and started drinking . Everybody got fairly drunk and started throwing everybody else 's hat up in the air and shooting at it . A hat would go sailing up in the air and it would sound like Saigon on election eve . This went on for a few minutes until it was Hose Manning , I think , that threw T. J.136 PART TWOThat holds true for some , I guess . But it does n't hold true for somebody like T. J. Lambert . The party which CBS gave was mainly for the NationalConference people , which are their friends , and therefore there were n't any dog-ass Jets around , or any of their dog-ass fans . What caused the trouble with T. J. Lambert , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly ran out of any decent Scotch and T. J. started drinking gin mixed with rum and brandy and tequila . I remember Puddin Patterson telling him , " Say , cat , if you drink that kind of mess , you liable to catch a silver bullet before this night 's over . " T. J. has a big old pink freckled face and small squinty eyes , and he said , " Shit , I 've drink everything from dishwater to polio vaccine in my day , Daddy . I do n't never kill nobody . And I do n't never puke . " T. J. Lambert is not the sort that anybody tells what to do , ever . He had once been shot in the belly , point blank , by an irate husband . And all he did was drive himself to the hospital and recover . That was in the off-season once , back in Tennessee . I personally saw T. J. beat up four cops one night in Dallas , the night before a game with the Cowboys . We had rented a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorine 's Paradise , a country music place . We wanted to unwind a little , and take our minds off the game. is138 PART TWOLambert 's Stetson up in the air . And there was n't a single shot fired . That 's how tough that sumbitch really is . Well , with all this in mind , you can understand why it got a little awkward at the CBS cocktail party in the Senor Sombrero Cafe when T. J. Lambert picked up the movie star , Camille Virl , and held her upside down by her ankles over the swimming pool off the terrace rail . T. J. just stood there snickering while Camille Virl screamed and cried , and while a whole crowd of people begged T. J. to bring her back up and not harm her . It was Barbara Jane Bookman , I 'd say , who rescued Camille Virl . T. J. 's wife , Donna Lou , might have been able to do something if she had been there , but I think Donna Lou , who is a pretty good Stovette , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane went over to T. J. and said , " T. J. , I always did think a woman looked better from this view , do n't you ? " T. J. said , " There 's her old wool right there . See it ? " Barbara Jane said , " What are you going to do with her ? " " I do n't know , " said T. J.Barbara Jane said , " Why do n't you drop her in the pool ? " T. J. swayed a little and said , " Wo n't she get her wool wet ? " Barbara Jane said , " Why do n't you lift her back up here with us ? " THE WOOL MARKET 139 " Naw , " said T. J. " She 'll scratch and bite me . " Barbara Jane said , " What did she do to make you mad , T. J. ? " T. J. belched and said , " Aw , I do n't know . I was talkin ' to her and she was comin ' on kind of strong like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we go somewhere and I 'd shit on her chest . " " I see , " said Barbara Jane , nodding . " She told me I was about half-foul and ought to be in a prison , so I picked her up and dangled her , which is where she is now . " " Yeah , " said Barbara Jane . " I do n't blame you . But now you 've scared her , so I think you ought to drop her in the pool or bring her back up . " T. J. said , " I think I 'm gon na puke . " Barbara Jane got Camille Virl 's attention and asked if she could swim and she said yes , goddamn it . " Drop her , " said Barb . " I 'm gone puke , " said T. J. , frowning . " Let her go , " said Barb . T. J. dropped Camille Virl into the swimming pool , about twelve feet down . A lot of cocktail party drunks applauded and some others gasped . Camille Virl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke of luck . Because she had no sooner hit the water than T. J. Lambert 's vomit did and she barely managed to get out of the way . Cissy Walford said , " That was such a pretty dress . " Boke Kellum ran down to the pool with some towels . Shake and me and Barbara Jane died laughing . And+-tai - 40piRer .. F - , , . -  --  wsr . 140 PART TWO THE WOOL MARKET 141we convinced Big Ed and Big Barb that it was really sort of funny , after all . Camille Virl was nothing but a phony movie star who was only trying to get publicity , and she deserved what happened . In fact , she would profit from it , we argued . T. J. Lambert said he felt a lot better , now that he had puked , and he said he was just sorry he never had puked before in his life , since it sort of revived a man and allowed him to start drinking again . " Let 's go somewhere and get a good piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm buyin ' . " " I 'd like a sixteen-ounce T-bone , medium rare , " said Barbara Jane . I just took time out here in my lemon-lime bubble bath to smoke a cigarette and think . That does n't hurt football studs , by the way . To smoke , I mean . Not to think . Most of us smoke a little , and you run it off . I was just thinking about Barbara Jane and all of us . And I was thinking about a conversation that Shake and me had one evening at our New York apartment during the regular season . We were just laying around drinking coffee and readingpapers and listening to an Elroy Blunt album . It was one of his new albums , the one called Flip Top Heart , which features that song . We were just laying there , anyhow , trying to decide whether to wander over to P. J. Clarke 's and eat some bacon cheeseburgers and argue with the owner , Danny Lavezzo , about the Giants andother intellectual things . Barbara Jane was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sixty-seventh Street , which is where it 's at . She was down in Palm Beach making a commercial for DDD and F.We had just talked to her , in fact , on the phone . And she had said that Palm Beach was the same old place  --  a lot of semi-rich Stoves running around with busted-out fags , and old ladies whose husbands had died , leaving them thoroughbred farms . Shake and me had always had conversations every so often about what the world amounted to . We did n't generally get too serious . Shake always questioned things more than I did , maybe because he read so many books . I always just believed a man ought to do the best he could , whether it involved playing ball or something else . I thought a man ought to laugh a lot . And then I thought a man turned up one day and just was n't breathing any more . And that was that . We were talking about Barbara Jane that night in our apartment and I said , " Old buddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I guess she has n't , " Shake said . " What do you think about that ? " I said . " Good , " he said . " Is it ? " I said . " I do n't know . " " It 's good , " he said . I was stretched out on a sofa with the coffee cup balanced on my chest , looking up at our trophy shelf142 PART TWOwith the game balls on it and at some pictures . I laid there for a minute and said , " Yeah , but I wonder where we 're all going ? " " Clarke 's , I hope , " Shake said , who was in a chair behindan issue of Sports Illustrated . I smiled and said , " In what you call your life , I mean . " " Oh , that . " Shake laughed . And he did n't add anything to it . After a while I said , " It 's hard for me to think of myselfever not playin ' ball . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said . " Yeah , " he said . " Since when ? " I asked . " I do n't know . Lately , maybe , " he said . I said , " What 's that mean ? " " Nothin ' actually , " he said . I raised up and leaned over and turned down Elroy Blunt , even though he was singing " Tell Me , Mister Tooth Brush . " " You like it better than me , old buddy , " I said . " And you got a chance to play a lot longer . " Shake said , " You realize how long you and me have been at it ? " " Fifteen years , I guess , starting with the Pee Wees , " I said . " Has n't it ever privately bothered you that we 're gettin ' close to thirty and we are n't anything but football players ? " he said . It had n't . THE WOOL MARKET 143And I said it had n't . " Well , you just asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That means you must have thought about it . I said , " Well , all I meant was , I wondered if we were ever gon na be married , like you and Barbara Jane , and me and somebody , and whether we would ever be living someplace like Greenwich and mowing the lawn or anything . " " Speaking for myself , " Shake said , " I can tell you that I 'm not ever gon na be in Greenwich . " I laughed . " I sure hope I 'm not , either , " I said . He said , " I might be in Marrakech , however , or on a ranch in Buenos Aires , or hiking in the rain forest on Kauai . " " You ca n't get the scores in any of those places , " I said . " You 're gon na have to be here in the fall . " Shake grinned and said , " Well , I 'll always know that TCU did n't beat anybody but Baylor and that Big Ed fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen to get some more coffee . He said , " When you think about it , we 've done about all there is to do , except win a Super Bowl . " We never won State for dear old Paschal High , I pointed out . Shake , coming back to his chair , said , " Yeah , but they fucked us out of that . Hell , you scored twice from the one and they did n't give it to us. " 144 PART TWOI said , " It was raining pretty hard . " " Yeah , but remember how hot we were when we saw the films later ? " said Shake . I said , " Have you ever felt as bad in your life as we did that night after the game ? " " Just killed is all , " Shake said . " I must have kicked in every door in that locker room , " I said . " Hell , I knew I scored . " Shake laughed to himself and said , " Did you ever see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " I do n't know what he lost , but I 'm sure it was everything in the envelope , " I said . " He still carries an envelope , you know . He 's still got the old bank and office right there in his coat pocket . " Shake looked off for a minute . Then he said , " SpringBranch . Rotten fucking Spring Branch . And we hadthose sumbitches down by fourteen at one time . " " Only time I ever saw Barb cry , " I said . " Hell , we all cried , " Shake said . " You can take your wars and your starvation and your fires and your floods , but there 's no heartbreak in life like losing the big game in high school . " I sat up and folded my hands behind my head . " Well , it makes you a man , " I said . Shake said , " That 's right , boy . Give ' em a few heartbreakersalong the way . Straighten ' em up . " " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet , " Shake said . " Make a lot of ' em poor . " " Turn some of ' em black , " I said . THE WOOL MARKET 145 " Mix in some cripples , " he said . " Mostly the black ones , " I said . " That 's what the world needs more of , " said Shake . " Poor black cripples . " " Who ca n't get hard-ons , " I said . " Kill some of their mothers , too , " my old buddy added . " Oh , Christ , " I said . And we kind of shook back and forth in laughter , and then sighed , and then did n't say anything for a while . Shake lit up a cigarette and slouched down in his chair and sipped on his coffee and said , " Billy C. , you know what I been thinkin ' I might do ? If we were to win the Super Bowl this year or next , which I think we got a chance to do ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nope , " he said . " I think I might hang old eighty-eight up and let ' em take it on to Canton , Ohio . " " Yeah , me too , " I said . " Next case . " " I 'm serious , " he said , and he was . " You 're serious , are n't you ? " I said . " I believe I am , " he said . " Well , that do n't make me feel so great , " I said . " I do n't know , really , " he said . " You got a lot of records you can break , " I said . " Records do n't mean shit , " Shake said . I lit up a cigarette my own self . " What the hell would you do if you did n't play any more ball when you 're still able ? " I wondered . " Not play ball , " he said . " And then what ? " I said. 146 PART TWO " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sore all the time from takin ' licks , " he said . " And not talk to a whole pack of dumb shits all the time . And not have to go to camp . And not look at a bunch of film . And not go to luncheons and dinners . And just not think about it any more . " I shook my head . " That does n't make any sense to me , " I said . " Well , that 's right , " Shake said . " You see , you 're gon na play until you drop because you really love it , and then you 're gon na be the coach of the Giants some day , and you 're gon na be goddamn good at it . But that 's not what I want to do , and I 'm almost thirty . " I guess I knew that Shake never wanted to be a coach . And I guess I thought that what he 'd do when he quit playing ball would be to take care of our investments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the club , or something , and marry Barbara Jane , and we would all just keep on hanging around New York . I guess that 's what I had always thought . I remember that I sat there for a while and tried to imagine what it would be like to play on a team without Marvin ( Shake ) Tiller on it . Because I never had . It did n't sound like fun . " What about Barb ? " I said . " What does she say about it ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " But it does n't really matter . " Shake said , " Barb is Barb and she does n't care what we do as long as it 's what we truly want to do . " I said , " O.K. , so you hang up old eighty-eight and then you go to Marrakech , or some fuckin ' place . Is thatTHE WOOL MARKET 147all right with Barb , to leave New York ? " Shake said , " Well , old Barb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " I must say that this struck old Billy Clyde by surprise and also made him feel sick for a second . " I just do n't believe that , " I said . " Or any of the rest of it . " Shake then said that this was the way his head was shaping up at the time being , and that it certainly was true how he felt . He said that he and Barbara Jane always had agreed that they would probably never get married legally be- cause that would fuck up their friendship as well as their love . He said that , anyhow , he and Barbara Jane had prob- ably been married , in spirit at least , ever since the fourth grade , and that sure was a long time . He said that this did n't mean he did n't love Barbara Jane more than almost anything he had ever known but he was just frankly tired of the responsibility of loving anything or doing anything , if I could understand that . I remember I said , " Owl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that , of course , it was per- fectly all right for Barbara Jane to accompany him to Istanbul or Marrakech or Tahiti as long as he did n't have any responsibility . As long , he said , as she did n't mind letting him sit in semi-open bars with bamboo curtains and ceiling fans and without a shave and look- ing for a young Rita Hayworth from the old movies to walk in . He said that being a pro football stud was probably148 PART TWO keeping him from ever doing some of the things which had always intrigued him . Like sitting at a sidewalk cafe in San Sebastian or being a spy in Geneva or a fur trader in the Yukon or getting drunk and painting a picture on a small island near Java and waiting for a tidal wave . He said he might want to own and run a bar in Puerto Vallarta or Trinidad or Positano . Or he might want to own and run a fishing boat somewhere around Japan . Or he said he might just want to go sit around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waves crash against the rocks and think up poetry . I told him that all of that was very interesting , but that he could go do all of it in the off-season , with Bar- bara Jane as well . And maybe I would go , too . " Not the same , " Shake said . " I want to disappear for a while , from everything I 've ever known . I think that would be fascinating . " " If I could n't get the scores , " I said , " it would n't do anything but make me hot . " " In your case , that 's right , " he said . I said , " Listen , old buddy . There never has been a more fired-up ball player than you , or a better leader . Do n't that tell you something ? Do n't you know what you really love ? " " What are you gon na tell me I love ? " he said . I said , " You love  --  aside from Barb , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hat in somebody 's gizzle . " Shake said , " Yeah , well , what I 'm trying to say , Billy C. , is that I 'm burnt out . I 've been gettin ' up for games THE WOOL MARKET 149for fifteen years and playin ' my ass off , and I 'm gettin ' close to that time , I can feel it , when I 'm gon na flame out . " Then he said , " I would like to win a Super Bowl though . " " There you are , " I said . " Let 's go to Clarke 's and get on the outside of some bacon cheeseburgers . " Shake said , " You know , the thing that would ruin Barb would be for her to be married legal . " I asked how come . " Well , " he said , " it 's because , basically , deep down , and she ca n't help it , she 's a fuckin ' woman . " I said I thought that was a pretty lucky break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " None of us have ever had an argument or a fight or hurt the others ' feelings , ever , have we ? " I said that 's right . " So , all right , let 's say me and Barb got married and lived somewhere and she was happy , " he said . " Happy with the place , whether it was Tangier or wherever . And I was happy there , running my bar with the ceiling fans and the bamboo curtains and all the spies coming in and out . Do you know what would happen one day , just as sure as hell ? " I did n't have any notion . " I would forget something , " he said . He said , " I would forget one day to pick up bread for dinner or maybe I would forget to hang up my clothes . Or I might even forget to fuck her . Well , Barb , now150 PART TWO being a legal wife , which would make her an owner of sorts , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She might say something smart-ass , or she might just utter a small complaint . But sooner or later , she would say something . Do you know what would happen then ? " I sure did n't . Shake said , " Well , what would happen is , she would blow all those years I 'd ever known her and loved her . She would piss me off about something that did n't make a shit and it would leave a scar and it would all be ruined . " I thought that over for an interlude and listened to the soft background of Elroy Blunt singing " Tear Me a New One . " " Seems a little harsh , " I said . Shake said , " Naw , that would do it . She 'd bitch one time , sooner or later , and the whole thing would be ruined . Women ca n't help it . It catches up with ' em . At one time or another , they got to bitch about something that do n't make a shit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one bitch in a lifetime , " I said . " Why ? " he asked . " I do n't know , " I said , honestly . " Has she ever bitched ? " he said . " Not that I know of , " I said . " Well , " he said , " you let her become a legal wife , an owner , and then you would see some dissatisfaction ex- pressed . " THE WOOL MARKET 151 " Even Barb ? " I said . " That 's the thing , Billy C. , " he said . " No matter how great she is  --  and she 's the best  --  she ca n't help the fact that she 's a woman . It 'll finally catch up with her , and I just do n't want to be there when it happens . " I asked my old buddy how he knew all this . " Books and movies and knowing people , " he said . I busted up laughing . Then I asked him what about men who bitched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do , you do n't take it seriously , and you can tell ' em to go shit in their wallets and they do n't get their feelings hurt and they do n't hold grudges , " he said . Women were certainly a different problem , I said . Shake went on , " Women take things personally when they should n't . For example , if you forget the loaf of bread , they have a tendency to think that you forgot it because you do n't love ' em as much as you did yesterday . And that 's not why you forgot the loaf of bread . You forgot the loaf of fuckin ' bread because you were drunk , or it was n't important enough to remember . " I said , " It might have been important to the woman . She might have needed it to cook you something good . " Shake said , " Then she could fix navy bean soup instead . Or enchilladas . " " Oh , that 's right . " I giggled . " I forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about women , and especially Barb , but that 's the way it is . " I said I guessed so . He said , " You were wondering where we 're all going152 PART TWOand that troubles me a lot more than it does you , like I said . The thing is , you see , where we 're going now does n't lead anywhere . " " We 're living , " I said , " and laughing . " He said , " Yeah , but it would all be ruined by Barb not getting her loaf of fuckin ' bread some day . See , I 've known the all-time girl and I 've loved her and she 's loved me . I 've had the all-time pal , which is you . And I 've played a game as good as anybody ever played it . Now I think I want to do something else . " " Find some spies , " I said . " Just do something different . It bothers me that all I 've ever done is be a split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does n't matter that you 've been loved and happy and famous and rich ? " I said . " Anybody can do all that , " he said . " All you got to do is want to , " I said . " I forgot again . " " Right , " said Shake . " In other words , " I said , " you want to go see if you can round up some misery somewhere . " Shake said , " Well , I 'm not exactly looking for any misery . I 've always been dead set against hunger or being thirsty , as you know . I think what I 'd like to find is something different to look at and something different to listen to , but I do n't know what . " " What 's your position on being lonely ? " I asked . Shake said , " Nobody 's lonely who 's got any sense . And if it 's female companionship you 're speaking of , well , you know old Shake ' Em Up , Shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a set of dandy lungs , alTHEWOOL MARKET 153though the colors may differ as he travels about . " I said , " Old buddy , what you 're telling me is that love does n't matter . " " Naw , " he said . " Love is great . Love is flowers and oceans and mountains and laughing and a Her or a Semi to share ' em with . But maybe I 'm tired of all that . It 's not so important any more . " Not as important as what else , I wondered . " I do n't know , " he said . " A new kind of talk , maybe . " I said , " Well , why do n't you go the fuck up to Harvard ? They 'll talk to you . " He said that was n't quite it , and he said that he supposedI could n't really understand what he was trying to say since I had to be somewhere so I could get the scores . " All I know , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way she loves you , I would have found everything I was ever looking for . And I would bust my ass more than I do on Sundays for the New York Giants trying to make her happy . Old Billy Clyde is the one who ought to be looking for something instead of you . " Shake said , " Aw , yours will turn up . She 'll walk right into a New York bar one night , a vision of loveliness and lungs and good nature . " " For fifty or a hundred , " I smiled . Shake said I was probably right about all of it and that he was probably crazy , but maybe he would be less crazy with a couple of bacon cheeseburgers down his neck at Clarke 's . " You do n't want to hang around with spies , anyway , " 154 PART TWO I said . " Most of ' em do n't even speak English , I hear . " " That 's right , " he said . " And they 're mostly men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah . " Piss on spies , " said Shake . " Let 's go eat and talk about football , or something that makes sense . " " Just do me a favor , old buddy , " I said . " Yeah , " he said . I said , " Do n't disappear on us until we 've had a chance to draft a good split end . " Well , friends , I am finally out of my lemon-lime bubble bath and I 'm sitting here on a stool by the dressing table , but I am going to have to take a shower now , because of something that took place in the past thirty minutes . There I was , all comfortable in my tub with my tape recorder and a cigarette , when the bathroom door cracked open and this voice came floating through . It was singing . What the voice sang was : His achin ' muscles soaked in that old tub where he was sittin ' , A day 's drive was done and that was good . But his drivin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , And his life was just as lonely as that engine ' neath the hood . Oh how he 'd drive , drive , drive that big old truck It was Elroy Blunt , naturally . He poked his head in the door wearing a large floppy- brimmed suede hat . THE WOOL MARKET 155 " Clyde ! " he whooped . " They told me you was in the tub so I made that up from the living room to here . Good to see you , son . " I told Elroy he was still a genius and I was delighted to see him . And I was . " They 's good times ahead , Clyde , " he said . " Nuthin ' but good times . " How 's it going ? I asked . " Just as smooth as the inside of a little old girlie 's thigh , " he said . " How ' bout your own self ? " Good , I said . " You look good , son , " he said . " Takin ' them old fag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the livin ' room wearin ' his pirate shirt and his velvet pants . Barbara Jane looks her same old delectable self , just as if the Old Skipper sent her to us from upstairs . And I want to congratulate you on that there Cissy what's-hername . Hmmmmmmmm , son . Strong . " She 's comforting , I said . " Clyde , that Cissy what's-her-name 's got to be stronger than a family of Mexkins , " he said . She 's understanding , I said . " Lookie here , Clyde , " said Elroy . " Now you know I 'm always thinkin ' of your fantasies . Ai n't that right ? Well , I done brought you a present . " I was n't sure whether that was good or bad . But it was O.K.What Elroy Blunt brought into the bathroom was what he described as a debutante from Savannah . Name of Sandi . " This here 's Sandi , " he said. 156 PART TWO I said it was a pleasure . Sandi was solid built and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark purple , and she looked somewhat bored . Elroy said , " If you will note , Clyde , young Sandi here is a lady with a whole dress full of titties . " She certainly was , I said . Elroy said , " Now , Clyde , if a man was to rate this particular set of delectable lungs on a scale of Small , Medium , Large , Gigantic and Just Right , where would you say they stood ? " Pretty close to all right , I said , and they were . " Strong , ai n't they ? " Elroy grinned , squeezing on one of Sandi 's enormous lungs and kissing her on the cheek . Sandi did n't seem to change her expression much . Her lashes flapped , that 's all . " Now , Clyde , one of the things they teach a Junior Leaguer in Savannah , I found out , is to start their tongue on a man 's big toes and work their way all the way up to the backside of his teeth . With intermittent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , I said . Elroy looked at Sandi and said : " Say somethin ' to my old podner here that 'll get him excited . " Whereupon young Sandi knelt down by my tub and stuck her arm in my lemon-lime bubble bath . " Let 's see what I can find down here , " she said . Elroy said then , " Well , I think I 'll leave you two love- birds alone for a while . Clyde , son . By God it 's good to THE WOOL MARKET 157see you . And there ai n't nuthin ' ahead but good times . Do n't worry about your guests in the livin ' room . The star 's here . He 'll entertain ' em . " Well , friends . All of this was just a while ago . Young Sandi has now finished practicing her hobby . She 's dressed again , and already gargled , and gone into the living room , where I 'm sure she received a warm receptionfrom Cissy Walford . Now I got to take me a shower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smelling good , and then Elroy brought me that Junior Leaguer for a present . With him around a man never knows what 's liable to happen . Anyhow , I got to get after it . We 'll chat later . Yawl come see us again in Savannah now , you heah ? THE WOOL MARKET 159DO N'T KNOW HOW ALL OF THE OTHER GREAT BOOKwriters do it but I like a little quiet and semi-solitude myself . It 's after one A.M. right now , which means that it has turned Saturday , the day before the game . I am laying here on the bed where Cissy Walford has gone to sleep in a mound of movie magazines . Everybody left our palatial suite pretty early , about midnight . That was just what me and Shake wanted to have . An early night . All we did was sit around , mostly , and talk about how we were going to dough-pop the dog-ass Jets . Elroy Blunt got out his guitar and sang about seven thousand tunes , which was fun , and relaxing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country music and they kept requesting things like " Moon Over Karakaua , " and " Palm Frond Mamba , " and " You 're the Twist in My Cocktail . " Once , Big Ed and Big Barb tried to do their version of the Fort Worth Slide when Elroy sang " You Ca n't Peel the Bark on a Redwood . " It was n't so good . Right in the middle of the evening Shoat Cooper showed up , as he is known to do . He was having hisusual case of pregame second thoughts and worry . He wanted me and Shake to go out in the hall with him and have a " gut check . " Shoat said he had been down in Hose Manning 's room chewin ' on his cud , as he put it , and there was something troubling him about the game . " I believe our defense is ready to stick ' em , " he said . " I ai n't worried about the defense . Their navels is gon na be screwed to the ground and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shoat said he figured our defense could hold the dogassJets to seventeen or maybe twenty-one points . Twentyfourat the most . " What this means , " he said , " is that our offense is gon na have to stay off the toilet seat . " Me and Shake shook our heads in agreement . " What troubles me , " he said , " is that I dreamed the other night that they ai n't gon na stay in their tendency defense . I think them sumbitches have so much respect for our runnin ' game they 're apt to give us a new look . " Shake said , " They ca n't overload anywhere . We got too many ways to fuck ' em . " Shoat said , " They can do one thing we ai n't thought about . " Me and Shake looked at each other , and back at Shoat . " They can Man you with Dreamer , " Shoat said , looking at Shake Tiller . " And send the whole rest of their piss ants after stud hoss here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Shake 'll dust his ass off . " Shoat said , " Why 's that ? " 160 PART TWO THE WOOL MARKET 161 " He just will , " I said . " Nobody 's ever been able to play Man on Shake . And the best have tried . " " Dreamer ai n't tried , " said Shoat . " So what ? " I said . " It 's just something that come to me in my sleep , " said Shoat . " It 'd be a gamble for ' em . But I think it 's what I might try , if I had me a Dreamer Tatum . " We all stood there in the hall and looked down at our feet . " What else this means , " said Shoat , " is that you 're gon na take some licks in there , stud hoss . You got to hang onto that football out there Sunday . We ca n't give them piss ants anything . " I hardly ever fumble , by the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Shake as if to ask him about all this . Shake said , " Coach , if I had one wish in life it would be for Dreamer Tatum to cover me Man . The whole fuckin ' game . " Shoat Cooper thought about that . Then he said : " Well , it would be an interestin ' thing to look at in the screening room some day , or maybe at a coaching clinic . But I do n't know as though it would help us win this football game . " Shake said , " If he tries to cover me Man , he 'll get at least three interference calls , and I can beat his black ass all day on deep . " " He cheats , " I said to Shoat . " He would n't cheat if his job was n't to stop no sweeps or pitches , " said Shoat . " If his job was only to intimidateold Eighty-eight here and climb inside his shirt , he would n't cheat for the run . " We stood there some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they use Dreamer that way they 're more dog-ass dumb than I ever thought , " I said . " It 's just somethin ' that bothered me in my sleep , " said Shoat . " I just wanted to know what you studs thought about it . " Shake said , " What 'd Hose think ? " Shoat pawed at the hall carpet and said : " Aw , old Hose , he just smiled . He said he kind of hoped Dreamer would be Man on you because at least if he was , then Hose would n't have to worry about gettin ' blind-popped from a corner blitz . " We grinned , me and Shake . " Everything 's cool , coach , " said Shake . " If they play that way , old Billy C. here might not get his hundred and thirty-five rushing but we 'll get everything else . " " You hosses feelin ' good ? " Shoat asked . " Ready as we 'll ever be , " I said . " Feelin ' fierce , coach , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ready to rape , ravage and plunder . " Shoat said , " You hosses get a lot of rest in these last few hours . I want them legs to have spring in ' em . It 's gon na be nigger on nigger out there Sunday . " " We 're ready , " I said again . And we said goodnight to old Shoat , who probablywent and drew circles and x 's for five or six more hours . Shake and me stayed in the hall after Shoat walkedoff. 162 PART TWO I said , " Is there any possibility whatsoever that Shoat could be right ? " Shake said , " None . " " No team gives up its basics and takes chances in a big game , " I said . " Right , " said Shake . " It 's all down to who executes . And besides that , they 're favored , " I said . " Or were . " " They think they can play normal and cover us up with busy , " said Shake . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started back into our palatial suite , but he stopped and grinned and said : " Goddamn , Billy C. Nobody ever said it was n't gon na be semi-tough . " On Thursday night when we had dinner with Big Ed and Big Barb we had a fairly pleasant night , as it turned out . Which was an upset . You do n't just go looking up Big Ed and Big Barb for dinner . Mainly you do n't because you know that Big Ed will take you through the whole history of the " oil bid- ness " again . And he 'll go right from that to what 's wrong with pro football , specifically the coaching . Generally , Big Ed will also get mad at one or two waiters or waitresses , so much so that people at other tables will stare at you . And so much so that the food and service will be pretty miserable for everybody . But , anyhow , it was n't bad . We went to that steak place on Rodeo where a place called the Daisy used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Beef Jesus . Big Ed was on his good behavior , as I say . Except for a few remarks about Hollywood having more Jews than it used to have  --  in a fairly loud voice . " Sorry you kids missed Hollywood back in the days when you could tell the women from the men , " he said . Another time , he said , " By god , I loaned some Jews out here some money one time and came out to check up on it and had me a hell of a time . That was before you , Mrs. Bookman . " Big Barb only smiled the whole time and kept glancingaround Beef Jesus to see what the other women were wearing . Big Ed did have a bit of a problem with the menu and the waiter , who looked and was dressed like straight Jesus and carried a big cardboard cross on his back as part of his costume . " Hi , there , " said the waiter . " I 'm Jesus Harold . I 've come back to serve you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half to his menu . " I do n't know where you came back from , young man , but it looks like you did n't grab anything but your underwearwhen you left , " he said . And Big Ed looked around the table to see if any of us thought that was funny . The waiter said , " The menu does n't actually mean much . The specials , I think , will intrigue you a lot more . The menu is mostly for , well , you know , people from Iowa , or somewhere . " 164 PART TWOJesus Harold adjusted his cross and stood with one hand on his hip . Cissy Walford wanted to know what the specials were . " To start , " said Jesus Harold , " I 've got avocado and aku , cold , of course , with Macadamia nut dressing . Very nice . I 've got spinach and mushroom pie . Unbelievable . I 've got asparagus soup , cold , of course , with some heavenly little chunks of abalone in it . I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got civiche without pitted olives . It 's terribly marvelous . " Big Ed looked up at Jesus Harold and said : " Now tell us what you 've got to eat . " I was on Big Ed 's side for once . Jesus Harold said , " On the menu , I 'm sure the light in here is good enough for you to find a shrimp cocktail , a salad with roquefort , and a New York cut . " Jesus Harold looked away while he was writing on his pad . " A little dish of vanilla for dessert ? " he said . " All around ? " Big Ed said for Jesus Harold to hold on there for a minute . He said he was n't interested in any of the specials . And he did n't think any of the rest of us were . What we really wanted was some good beef . Nothing to start . Just bring us some more drinks and six good pieces of beef with maybe some asparagus and sliced tomatoes . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you ? " said Big Ed . Jesus Harold said , " If we do , I will personally rope it and drag it out here . " THE WOOL MARKET 165We all smiled at Jesus Harold , who wrote down our order . Or Big Ed 's . " Thank you very much , " said Jesus Harold . " I 'll tell Jesus Barry to bring you another round of drinks . " " Those are all medium rare , " said Big Ed . " Of course they are , " said Jesus Harold . " Life itself is medium rare . " Our waiter left , straightening the cross on his back and clomping his sandals across the floor . The steaks were n't bad . Big Ed and Big Barb asked Cissy Walford several questions about her parents . They decided they knew some rich people her parents knew . Big Barb asked Barbara Jane if she had done several things to her apartment since they had last seen it . Big Ed discussed a number of things that were wrong with the current economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were three and eight . He also reviewed next season 's prospects and said that one of TCU 's problemswas they had too many niggers on offense and a couple of Jesus Harolds in the secondary . As Big Ed always does , he proposed a toast when dinner was over and Jesus Harold had sent Jesus Barry around with some stingers . It was the same old toast . It was the toast where Big Ed says that you come into the world naked and bare , or something , and you go through the world with trouble and care . Then he says you go out of the world you know not where . But if you 're a thoroughbred here , he says , getting louder , you 're a thoroughbred there . Me and Shake and Barb have learned to listen to the166 PART TWO toast with blank expressions . We raised our glasses again when Big Ed finished . And Big Ed said , " Goddamned if I do n't love a thor- oughbred in life . And we 've got a whole table of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while on how he had molded most of our lives and helped us become thoroughbreds . Except for Cissy Walford , of course . He said her daddy , being a wealthy man , had probably done the same thing for her . He said he and her daddy had a lot in common . " Respect for the American dollar , " he said . " What 's good for America is good for the world , " he said . " If the world stops believing that , we may have to kick ' em in their chink asses again , " he said . Big Ed went through some of his fond memories about me and Shake and Barb . Big Barb joined in occasionally . Cissy Walford yawned once or twice . Big Ed said he could n't be happier to have turned out such a handsome daughter who seemed to have all of her mother 's good taste . He said he did n't understand some of her wit , but , hell , this was another generation . Only a couple of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sorry a few years ago that Barbara Jane had refused to become a Fort Worth debutante like her mother had planned it . Which would have been the exact same year her mother got herself elected president of the Assembly and the Junior League and the Republican Women for White Freedom  --  the triple crown , so to speak . The Assembly was a club that picked debutantes . Big Ed said he would have thrown a hell of a debutante THE WOOL MARKET 167party for Barb . He said he would have brought in Freddy Martin 's orchestra and Bert Parks and a lot of other show biz celebrities that he knew . He said he was sorry , too , that Barbara Jane had gone to TCU instead of a place like Mrs. Bellard-Ronald 's in upstate New York . " I 'm for TCU as far as our town 's concerned , " he said . " What the hell we got down there , other than a bomber plant and a bunch of goddamned apartment builders on the city council ? But you can go too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to a lady 's school . " " Clarice Stuart in Ironwood , Virginia , would have been perfect , " Big Barb said . Barb said , " Terrific . " Big Ed said his other major disappointment was when his very own daughter and some other girls got caught spending the night in the athletic dorm at TCU . " I never expected such a thing from a Bookman , " said Big Ed . We began laughing . " I 've never felt so destroyed , " Big Barb said . Shake said , " It all worked out . It was a joke , anyhow . " And Big Ed said , " You goddamn right it worked out . After I worked it out . I thought for a while I 'd have to buy the Fort Worth Light &; Shopper , and I 'd just as soon own a dry hole in Egypt . " " Bookman Heiress Shacks Up with Football Studs , " said Barb , teasing . " Hell of a story . Aw , come on , Daddy . Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know that . " 168 PART TWO " It 's funny now , huh ? " said Big Ed . " It 's pretty funny , I think , " I said . " That was some night . That was the night after the varsity picnic at Lake Worth . The spring before our junior season . " Shake said , " The night we scuttled Bobby Roy Simp- son 's forty-footer . " Barb said , " You mean the night Bubba Littleton did . " " Well , Bubba did the work but I think it was our idea . " Shake grinned . Big Ed said , " Wait a minute . Somebody sank some- body 's boat that night ? " Shake said , " It did n't matter . Bobby Roy Simpson was a rich kid who liked to hang around with the football studs . He had several boats . " Big Ed said , " Well , I 've got several boats myself but I 'll be goddamned if I want anybody sinkin " em . " Barbara Jane laughed and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It really did n't , " she said . " If you had known Bobby Roy Simpson , you would have sunk his boat with him in it . " Big Ed said it still did n't seem right , somehow . A man 's boat and all . A private property deal . Shake said , " I do n't remember why we thought it would be all right to bring the girls back to Tom Brown Hall . It seemed like the thing to do , though . " I said , " Was n't that the same night that Bubba Little- ton tore the pay phone out of the wall ? " " Sure was , " said Barbara Jane . " And threw the Coke machine down two flights of stairs . Double-header . " Shake said , " Well , you know why he was so hot ? " THE WOOL MARKET 169Me and Barb broke up . We knew . Bubba Littleton was hot because Honey Jean Lester had caught him that afternoon flogging it underneath the dock as I have mentioned earlier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's white could do things like that , " Big Ed said . " He was just mad at his date about something , " I said . " Well , Bubba Littleton was n't a good enough football player at TCU to get away with things like that , " Big Ed said . " Destroying property is what chinks and Commieswant . " " He was a pretty mean tackle , " Shake said . " He 'd hit somebody . " I said , " He was about half-mean all the way around . " Shake said , " How about those poor Aggies ? " I wished Shake had n't said that just when I had my young stinger up to my face . I nearly spit in it from laughing . On a Friday night in Fort Worth one time before a game we had against Texas A &M,; Bubba Littleton went downtown to a pep rally the Aggie cadet corps was having because he wanted to get him some Aggies as captives , for a joke . I never knew any other TCU man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bubba of course could go anywhere he wanted to . He used to go look up truck drivers and try to get them to fight him to see who bought the beer . Anyhow , Bubba went downtown and got him four Aggie cadets and brought them back to his dorm room. 170 PART TWO The first thing he did was shave off all of their hair , what little they had , being Aggie cadets . Then he made them get naked and shave all the hair off of each other 's bodies and vital parts . They were just scrawny little old Aggies whose daddies had made them go there in the first place , to Texas A &M,; I mean , which is kind of like going to Sing Sing . So they could n't do anything except what Bubba Littleton wanted them to do , not unless they wanted to get an arm broke . The next thing Bubba did was take some purple paint  --  purple is TCU 's color  --  and make the Aggies stand at attention while he painted something on each one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when they stood in a certain order was : AGGIES . . . IS . . . SEMI- . . RURAL . Bubba finally let the poor souls go after they sang the TCU fight song to his satisfaction , and after they had a beat-off contest . We carried on a little more with Big Ed and Big Barb about our growing-up days . Big Ed said that one of the things which pleased him the most is that me and Shake and Barbara Jane had never needed any of his money . Like all rich guys , Big Ed said he did n't have a whole lot of money but that he had managed to keep some from the government . And he said it was always there if any of us ever needed it for something important . Big Ed said that what he planned to do with what little money he had , when he died , if none of us needed it for something important , was leave it to various things THE WOOL MARKET 171around Fort Worth , in his memory . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upperdeck the entire stadium and call it Big Ed BookmanColiseum . He said the family 's first oil pump was still out in Scogie County but that he hoped the city would one day want to bring it to town and put it on the lawn of the Convention Center . He said it would be interesting history . " Who are you going to leave your heart to ? " Barbara Jane asked in a wry way . Big Ed looked at Barb as if she was a Communist . " Big Ed 's heart goes with Big Ed , " he said . " That 's just goddamn foolishness , giving up things like that . " Big Ed said , " Would n't I be in a fine fix to come back on Earth some day without a goddamn heart ? " Barbara Jane howled . " I do n't want to talk about that kind of thing , " said Big Ed . " I know everybody has different ideas these days . I just do n't give one goddamn how many transplant cases are walking around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God wanted ' em to be . " Shake said , " Damn right . If God wanted a man to have two hearts , he 'd have given him two hearts . If God had wanted a man to drink more , he 'd have given him two mouths . " Big Ed said , " Go ahead and be funny about it . But I 'll tell you this , Eighty-eight . You go out and get yourself a nigger 's heart and then we 'll see how many footballs you catch on Sunday . " 172 PART TWO THE WOOL MARKET 173 " Can you believe it ? " said Barbara Jane , looking at us . Big Ed said we 'd do well to listen to him . He said he guessed he would have to educate us , once and for all . Why in the hell did we think Barbara Jane was such a beautiful and great girl ? Why was that ? He said , well , he would explain it to us . By God , it was because she was a thoroughbred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bookman stock . And do n't think that did n't mean plenty , he said . Big Ed said that God was n't so dumb that he did n't know there had to be a few people around in history to see that the world ran right . He said that God tried to turn it all over to mankind once and it just did n't work . A whole goddamn bunch of chinks and niggers got born , along with a whole lot of spicks and Mongol hordes . That pissed God off , he said . So God took over again and God 's been trying to straighten it out ever since , without ruining his image . He said God would sneak a tidal wave in every now and then , or an earthquake , or a volcanic eruption , and then a few wars , to get rid of several million undesirables outside of America . It 's a slow process , Big Ed said , because it got so far out of hand , and God has to be careful and do it slowly , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . Now then , he said , sipping on his stinger . While all of this has been going on , God has allowed some carefully selected people he could trust to get bornand take rich and be able to run things . These are people , he said , like all of the great rulers and businessmen of history . Well , he said , they 're people like the Murchisons and Hunts were , or like some corporationpresidents he had known , and some generals , and himself . The Bookmans , he said , went back a long way . God sent the first Bookman over on the Mayflower to help get America started off right . The reason , he said , was becauseGod knew that America would be able to get the rest of the world to shape up . Eventually . Like today . The Bookmans , he said , distinguished themselves in all of the wars , including his own self in World War II , which none of us could much remember , he guessed . The big war , where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and did it right . He said that God obviously did n't want him to get killed in that war , basically because he had some big money to earn and some jobs to provide later on , and that 's why God had given him the intelligence and the aristocracy to go into the army as a colonel at the age of twenty . He said God knew what he was doing when he worked it out that Big Ed got to stay in Washington , D.C. , throughout the big war and help out with many of the important decisions that were made about who to kill next . Now then , Big Ed said again . One of the wonderful things that came out of him being preserved and not killed , as God had shown the174 PART TWOgood sense to do , was that he got to meet Big Barb in college when they were at the University of Texas , after the big war . Big Barb had come from a fine family herself , he said . The Huckabees from Waco , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , with her hair of streaked butterscotch , her deep brown eyes , her olive complexion , her splendid cheekbones , her full lips , her perfect teeth , her big bright smile and her keen mind and , according to her mother , her flawless carriageand good taste and her incredible body . " It took a lot of Bookmans to produce that , " said Big Ed in conclusion . " And one hell of a lot of earthquakes , " said Barbara Jane . SEE BY THE OLD EAST-WEST SHRINE GAME WRISTwatch that it 's about time for Billy Clyde to grab his eight or nine hours . The time is beginning to pass very slowly , I think . It 's always this way before a big game . When I wake up it will be Saturday morning , and that 's still another twenty-four hours before we can put on our hats and get after the dog-ass Jets in the biggest football game there is , the old Super Bowl . My plans for Saturday are to lay around a lot and rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fruit , and maybe some wool . I may not even have more than a couple of drinks . Elroy Blunt of course is going ahead and having his party in the mansion he has rented for the weekend in Bel Air . That 's where a lot of studs live out here who have fucked people out of some serious money . I guess we 'll attend the party but just for a short while . Elroy said he would have some steaks for those of us who have a game to play and do n't want to log up on eight or ten dozen barbecued ribs and beans and potato salad . Elroy said he was laying in a Mississippi River of Scotch , a Lake Michigan of vodka and an English Chan-176 PART TWOnel of beer . He said if anybody wanted anything to drink other than that , which he would not be able to understandor even tolerate , they could smoke dope instead . He said he had two footballs stuffed with the best grass any A-rabs could smuggle in . Elroy said he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of rock groups for dancing on the lawns , a few semi-starlets , and several debutantes for those who did n't have dates or wives , or even for those who did . He said there should n't be more than a hundred people in all . He said he had taken the precaution to arrange for fourteen Cadillac limousines with TV 's and telephones and bars in them to arrive at ten A.M. Sunday and ensure that everybody got to the Los Angeles Coliseum in time for the game . He said there would be two or three doctors on hand with Bl shots and Dex and penicillin to handle various things like hang-overs , fatigue and the clap . " You do n't know about some of these debutantes , " he said . " If they look a bit worn , you ought to take some penicillin just to eliminate the mental grief . " Me and Shake told Elroy he sure was thoughtful of his guests . We asked what the whole thing was going to cost him . " Nowhere near as much as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I can probably get away for three or four thousand whip-out . " Elroy said that would include tips for the debutantes . THE WOOL MARKET 177There was a minute or two in the living room of our palatial suite tonight  --  or last night , I should say , seeing as how it 's almost two A.M.  --  when Barbara Jane and I talked about my literary effort . And about ourselves . She said she had now listened to everything I 'd spoke up to a day ago and she said she thought it was still semi-honest and half-funny . But she said she thought it was a little embarrassing for her own self . " I think you make me sound like a goddamn priceless emerald or something , " she said . " I 'm going to tell Jim Tom to tone me down with some editing . In terms of the characterization of Barbara Jane Bookman , you are writing what they say in the magazine business is an all-out , no-holds-barred , hard-hitting puff . " I told her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd see to it that he wound up his career writing bowling scores . Got that , Jim Tom ? Barb put her hands on my shoulders and kissed me , gentle like . Then she wrapped her arms around my waist and put her head on my chest . I held her there for a while , with my chin resting on top of her streaked butterscotch hair , which was parted in the middle and hung down quite a ways , soft , straight and pretty . We squeezed on each other like good friends and kind of stood there . She said , " I wonder what I 've missed , not ever knowinganybody very well except Old Twenty-three and Old Eighty-eight ? " " Hardly anything , " I said. 178 PART TWO " I 've never even cared about anybody else , not really , " she said . " Damn it , nobody else ever laughed enough . " I said , " If you ever had cared about anybody else , you could n't have been a Two . " " One , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One , " she said softly , looking up and kissing me again , and then putting her head back where it was . I smiled and I think she did too . There was another pause . And then Barb said , " A serious question , O.K. ? " She said that to my shirt . " Anything , anytime , anywhere , " I said . " What 's the story on the game ? " Barb said . " Do we win or do we lose ? " I said , " Straight deal ? " " Straight deal , " she said . " No owl shit ? " I said . " No owl shit , " she said , looking up . " Just unbutton your shirt and let your heart fall out , boy . " I kind of cleared my throat and took a breath and said , " Well , I think we 've got a better team . I think we 've got more character . " " Is that an answer ? " Barb said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I smiled . We untangled and Barb held my hands and looked into my eyes as if there was a scoreboard in there some- where . She looked at me for several seconds and I looked at her , which is always a delight . THE WOOL MARKET 179Finally , she squeezed my hands tight and said , " We 'll win . " Barb went on off across the room , then , presumably to see if she could rescue anybody that Big Ed and Big Barb were boring to death . And now I , Billy Clyde Puckett , am going off to stack me up some Z 's . See you around the campus , as they say . Is that what they say ? PART THREEGame-FaceWill they play a Super Bowl in Heaven ? Will the fans be drinkin ' beer ? Will any long-haired , lovely girlsBe there to cheer ?  --  from " The Ballad of Billy Clyde , " a song by Elroy BluntI MAY HAVE TO DOUGH-POP CISSY Walford before I ever get around to the dog-ass Jets . What she has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she is supposed to be about half-crazy about , which is me . I am hotter than a pot of butter beans right now , as you might can guess . Shit , I 'm hot . What Cissy did was go squirt off her mouth to Boke Kellum , our friendly neighborhood fag Western hero , about this book I am writing . And what Boke Kellum did was go squirt off his mouth to the newspapers about it , and here it all is , right here in my hand in the Saturday morning Los Angeles Times . The dog-ass headline says : PUCKETT TURNS AUTHOR FOR SUPER BOWL . The story says : All-Pro Running Back Billy Clyde Puckett , who may hold the key to the New York Giants ' chances in tomorrow 's Super Bowl , will be taking notes on the sidelines throughout the game . The Times has learned that Puckett is keeping a diary of Super Bowl Week and will turn it into a  --  184 PART THREE GAME-FACE 185hard-cover book for a major publishing house next fall . Puckett 's book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is understood that Puckett is delving into many personalities involved in the Super Bowl attraction , and will present some of the darker sides of the game of pro football itself . Much of the book , the Times has learned , will be devoted by Puckett to describing exactly how the Giants prepared for the contest . It is also believed that Puckett will describe how he developed his rip-roaring running style , a style which has made him the leading rusher in the NFL . Parts of the book will also touch on some of Puckett 's close friends , such as Boke Kellum , the handsome star of the hit TV series , McGill of Santa Fe . There 's some more but mainly it 's quotes from some of the dog-ass Jets , like Dreamer Tatum , about me being so talented as to be able to prepare for a big game and write a book at the same time . Boy , I am so hot right now that I could turn into some kind of T. J. Lambert . If there was ever a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the day before the Super Bowl . Cissy Walford has already cried a few times this morning and tried to make everything all right by grabbing me in the crotch but it has n't helped . I 've told her that if I lay my eyes on Boke Kellum again I was gon na leave him every way but alone . Man , I 'm still hot . And all of this hit me more than an hour ago when I got up . I do n't usually get hot like this for anything other than a football game . But I am hot . Shake says that I should n't be so hot because a lot of other stud athletes have written books and everybody just figures that it 's what a stud athlete does for money these days . Barbara Jane said she did n't think it was anything to be bothered about . " It 's not as if we 've just lost to Spring Branch . " She smiled . Barb said the best way to look at it was that the dog-ass Jets would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live intellectual book writer . I said what bothered me most was having to go to a squad meeting pretty soon and take a lot of shit from my pals . But it 's something I 've got to do . And right away , in fact . See you in a little while , gang . If there 's anything left of me after T. J. Lambert gets through . If not , I 'd like my ashes pitched out of a taxi at the northeast corner of Fifty-fifth and Third . That 's where P. J. Clarke 's is , of course . It 's probably asking too much of the owner , Danny Lavezzo , to hang my photo on the wall , back there in the back room where all the celebs hang out ; back there with the checkered tablecloths and the Irish waiters. 186  --  the room where everybody stands in line , hoping and praying for a table in the back . There 's nothing in the middle room but too much light , and some drunks standing around a garbage pail . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his picture up on the wall in Clarke 's , without dying . Not even a Greek ship owner or a columnist . If Frank Giffordor Charley Conerly or Kyle Rote could n't do it from the old Giant glory days , I do n't know how I could expect it . Maybe my only chance is if T. J. Lambert turns me into a tragic legend . " Oh , what could have been , " they 'll say in Clarke 's . And hang my picture . Feelin ' you is feelin ' like a wound that 's opened wide , Feelin ' you means troubles by my side . Feelin ' you ai n't easy , Do n't know how much I can take . Feelin ' someone gone is feelin ' nuthin ' but an ache . When you took my credit cards and headed north across the bay , When you piled up all my clothes there in the hall , When your anger made you laugh at all the bills I 'd have to pay , GAME-FACE 187I could hear you laughin ' louder while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuthin ' but a servin ' wench , it 's true . Serve it up and grab a tip or two . Eggs fried greasy , coffee dark , Donuts hard as sycamore bark , But you 'll trap another fool like you know who . I just hope you 'll keep on movin ' down the road . Movin ' faster than I 'm drivin ' this old load . Much more heartache I ai n't needin ' , Though your looks have got me bleedin ' , I 'm just about to get your memory throwed . But feelin ' you is feelin ' like a wound that 's opened wide , Feelin ' you means troubles by my side . Feelin ' you ai n't easy , Do n't know how much I can take . Feelin ' someone gone is feelin ' nuthin ' but an ache . Nothing helps trouble and woe , I think , like listening to music . I 've been listening to some Elroy Blunt tunes here on the portable stereo we brought with us to our palatial suite . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You , " which is those words I 've just recited , in a semitunefulway . It 's late in the afternoon upon this Saturday in Janu-188 PART THREE ary . I 've been back from the squad meeting for quite a while and had lunch up here in the suite . Some of the Giant fans who have flown out for the game are having a party down around the cabanas by one of the swimming pools . That 's where Barbara Jane and Cissy are . Shake Tiller and Hose Manning have gone over to the Beverly Wilshire to talk to some Sports Illustrated writers and editors and reporters and pho- tographers . We 'll be heading out to Elroy Blunt 's mansion for his party in a while . He drew up directions for our rented car on how to get there . This has n't been too good a day for the stud hors , un- fortunately . All of my teammates had read that story in the Los Angeles Times , and of course they all clapped when I walked into the squad meeting . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Say , baby , you ai n't gon na write anything about what a cat does on the road , are you ? " Puddin Patterson said , " Tell us about that rip-roarin ' runnin ' style . Do you just jive it on in there for six by your own self ? " Puddin said , " Er , uh , say , baby . Do you rip first , or do you roar first ? " There was lots of giggling among my pals . Euger Franklin said , " If me and Puddin ai n't blockin ' nobody 's ass , he just lay down , baby . " Varnell Swist said , " What you gon na say about the road , baby ? Some wives is gon na read that mother you GAME-FACE 189writin ' , you dig what I 'm sayin ' ? " Puddin Patterson said to the squad , " Lookie here , cats .

Lambert had n't spoke until he finished the sack of chili cheeseburgers he brought to the squad meeting . He finally stood up and licked his fingers and bent over , with his butt toward me , and he cut one that must have been the color of a Christmas package . " That 's all I got for tootie fruitier what write books , " he groaned . In the serious part of the squad meeting , Shoat Cooper explained to us what the drill would be for Sunday , in terms of what time everything would occur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight o'clock tomorrow morning . Those that needed special braces and pads taped on , he said , ought to get to the taping room thirty minutes earlier . He said he hoped everybody on the team could have breakfast together at nine in the Senor Sombrero Cafe on the second floor . He said we would leave for the Los Angeles Coliseum about ten-thirty . It would be about eleven-fifteen when we got there , he said , and that would give us plenty of time . " To get frisky for them piss ants , " he said . The kickoff was n't until one-fifteen , he pointed out . It had been set back fifteen minutes by CBS , he said , in order for the network to finish up a news special it was doing on some kind of earthquake that wiped out several thousand chinks somewhere yesterday . It was news to me and Shake and we shared some kind of look which had to do with Big Ed Bookman . News about the earthquake , I mean . Not about the kickoff . Shoat said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on both teams , for television before the game . He said we should line up under the goal post that would be appointed to us and carry our hats under our arms when we trotted out to our own forty-five yard line and faced the dog-ass Jets and stood there for the " Star-Spangled Banner . " That would be the last thing we would do before the kickoff , Shoat said . Therefore , he said , this would come after we had warmed up and then gone back into the dressing room and crapped and peed and drank some more Dexi-coffee . Them what needed it , like the interior linemen . " A little spiked coffee never hurt nobody 's incentive , " Shoat said . " Especially them lard butts who have to play down in that trench where the men are . " Shoat said we might have a long time to lay around the dressing room after we warmed up because the NationalFootball League had a fairly lavish pregame show planned . Shoat said he understood that both the pregame show and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be anything but good for football , " he said . According to Shoat , here 's what was going to happen before the game : Several hundred trained birds  --  all painted red , white and blue  --  would be released from cages somewhere and they would fly over the coliseum in the formation of an American flag. 192 PART THREE GAME-FACE 193 As the red , white and blue birds flew over , Boke Kel- lum , the Western TV star , would recite the Declaration of Independence . Next would be somebody dressed up like Mickey Mouse and somebody else dressed up like Donald Duck joining the actress Camille Virl in singing " God Bless America . " And right in the middle of the singing , here would come this Air Force cargo plane to let loose fifty sky divers who would come dropping into the coliseum . Each sky diver would be dressed up in the regional costume of a state , and he would land in the coliseum in the order in which his state became a United State . When all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete Rozelle , the ex-commissioner of the NFL who invented the Super Bowl , would be driven around the stadium in the car that won last year 's Indianapolis 500 . At the wheel would be Lt. Commander Flip Slam- mer , the fifteenth astronaut to walk on the moon . Riding along behind the Indy car , Shoat said , would be two men on horses . One would be Commissioner Bob Cameron on Lurking Funk , the thoroughbred which won last year 's Kentucky Derby . And on the other horse , Podna ( the horse Boke Kellum pretends to ride in his TV series ) , would be the current president of CBS , a guy named Woody Snider . Finally , Shoat said , the teams would be introduced and two thousand crippled and maimed soldiers on crutches and in wheel chairs and on stretchers would render the " Star-Spangled Banner . " Shoat told us the halftime was likely to run forty-five minutes . It would be a long one , at any rate , " which might be a good thing if we got some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the halftime , Shoat said , would depend on whether CBS would decide to interrupt the Super Bowl telecast with a special news report on the earthquake , which might still be killing chinks with its fires and floods and tidal waves . " I never knowed a dead chink , more or less , to be more important than a football game , " Shoat said . " But maybe if a whole gunnysack of ' em get wiped out , it 's news . " Shoat said it was too bad we would all have to miss it but the Super Bowl halftime show was going to be even more spectacular than the pregame show . He said there would be a water ballet in the world 's largest inflatable swimming pool , a Spanish fiesta , a Hawaiian luau , a parade stressing the history of the armored tank , a sing-off between the glee clubs of all the military academies , and an actual World War I dogfight in the sky with the Red Baron 's plane getting blown to pieces . The final event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induction into the pro football hall of fame of about twenty stud hosses out of the past , including our own Tucker Frederickson , the vice-president of DDD and F. United States Senator Pete Rozelle would preside , Shoat said , along with Camille Virl , the actress , and Jack Whitaker , the CBS announcer . When the induction cere-194 PART THREE GAME-FACE 195mony was over , Shoat said , then Rozelle and Whitaker and Camille Virl would lead the inductees in singing a parody on the " Battle Hymn of the Republic , " which was written by somebody in the league office . The title of it , he said , was " The Game Goes Marching On , " and he understood it might make some people cry . Shoat said CBS hoped the whole stadium would join in the singing , since all 92,000 people would have been given a printed copy of the lyrics . The last thing in the halftime would be some more birds . While the stadium was singing this song , Shoat said , several thousand more painted-up birds would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the likeness of Vince Lombardi , the great old coach , would appear . This was about all that was discussed at the meeting . Shoat said for all of us to start getting our game-face on . " When we take that field , " he said , " I want you pine knots to be in a mood to stand them piss ants ever way but up . " I got a collect long-distance call from Fort Worth a while ago and of course it was from my Uncle Kenneth . He just called up to thank me for the fifty-yard line seat I sent him along with a first-class round-trip plane ticket . Uncle Kenneth said that as much as he wanted to be out here , he did n't rightly see how he could go off and leave an acquaintance he had made with an old boy whothought he knew all about how to play gin . I said I understood . That when a good business opportunitypresented itself , a man had to act on it . Uncle Kenneth said he would certainly be watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had four large bet on it  --  at pick  --  and how did I feel ? Perfect , I said . I told him he could cash that plane ticket in for some whip-out , if he wanted to . Uncle Kenneth said he had done that , already . But he said he was going to keep the game ticket as a souvenir , if I did n't mind . " How 's old Shake ' Em Up , Shake Loose ? " he said . " He fit and all ? " Sure was , I said . " And old Barber Jane ? " he said . " Still prettier'n a crocheted afghan , I guess . " You bet , I said . " Well , Billy , you have a good ball game now , " UncleKenneth said . " Remember what I 've always said to you . A lot of first downs'Il take you to that land of six . " That 's right , I said . " First downs , Billy , " he said . O.K. , I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . You got that right , I said . " The YMCAs are full of all ' em that come second , " he said . Sure are , I said . Take care now . " First downs , Billy , " said Uncle Kenneth , hanging up. 196 PART THREE GAME-FACE 197All I wanted to do just now was clean up and be ready to go to Elroy Blunt 's party . That 's sure all I wanted to do but of course I did n't get to do that because I had me some visitors . Burt Danby , the head of DDD and F ( and therefore the head of the Giants ) stuck his self in the door of our palatial suite and held up his hand . " Got five ? " he said . " I can come back . " I said he might as well come on in and get a seat be- fore the Communist army got here . " I just wanted you to meet a super guy , " said Burt , who was wearing his **25;14226;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white pants and white shoes that were tight and soft like little old white and soft gloves . It was just my own self at home , I said . Shake Tiller was still over at Sports Illustrated 's penthouse in the Beverly Wilshire , and the girls were down at the swim- ming pool . " Saw the girls , saw the girls , " said Burt . " They 're in splendid hands down at the cabanas . Hell of a party go- ing on down there . Christ , it looks like Manuche 's at Monday noon after we 've won a biggie . My God , it 's like Shor 's in the old days down there . Jesus , it looks like Weston 's when Sinatra used to drop by . Fantastic ! It looks like Elaine 's when the King of Morocco 's in town . The place is crawling with top guys . Crawling . " I said there was n't any party going on up here unless somebody cared to watch me take a shower . I had on my shorts . Burt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tall , sunburned fellow who had a drink in his hand and was dolled up in such a way that nobody could ever have guessed that he came from Madison Avenue and had to be one of those Eastern , lockjaw motherfuckerswho would n't know shit from tunafish . Burt 's friend had on some light-gray pants and a navy blue coat and some shiny buckled loafers and the last of the Brooks Brothers white button-downs and a greenand-goldstriped tie . He also had on a big button , pinned to his coat , which said : ALCOHOLICS UNANIMOUS . It only took me an instant to figure out that I had seen the guy before . He was that empty suit from the Sports Illustrated party that Shake Tiller had made sport of . Burt Danby said , " Stud hoss , say hello to a hell of a guy . Put it in the vise with Strooby McMackin , the president of Kentuckian Cigarettes . " I said hidy . " President , " Burt Danby said . " As in who runs the store . As in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ads . " I said hidy again . Strooby McMackin had a voice no louder than your average lift-off at Cape Kennedy . He said , " I met the stud the other night . Unfortunately  --  heh , heh  --  I was shit-faced and do n't remember much . Hello again . " Burt Danby said Strooby McMackin was a hell of a good guy and a super client of DDD and F , even if he was sort of a sentimental Jet rooter . " Oh , I like all football , " said Strooby McMackin . " I198 PART THREE guess I became a Jet fan a few years ago before I took over this company . You have to be Jesus Christ to get a Giant ticket . " Burt Danby said , " You 've got ' em now , fellow . For next year . As many as you need . " Burt laughed heartily and patted Strooby McMackin on the arm . " Get you a pop ? " Burt said to his friend . " Another tightener ? Just down the hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Want a little see-through ? " Strooby McMackin said no , he was fine . He said , " Puckett , I saw those young ladies you were with at the SI party . They 're down around the cabanas with your whole New York Giant gang . Mike was down there a while ago , and Jerry and Felix and Stanley . All the die-hards I see around midtown . " Good , I said . " The whole goddamn gang , " he said , " Danny 's there , Susan , Norm , Jimmy , Teddy , Eloise , Jack , Crease . God- damn place looks like the back room at Clarke 's . " Burt Danby said , " Strooby walked up and said , Can Frankie get me a table here ? ' Christ , that was funny , Stroob . " I tried to smile . Strooby McMackin said , " Anyhow , I apologized to your girl friends for all the language the other night . Dynamite girls , by the way . " Sure are , I said . Burt Danby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . You ought to be in the Giant camp , Stroob . You really should . " GAME-FACE 199Burt looked at me and said , " He 'd better go with a winner , had n't he ? " I said , " It 's gon na be semi-tough , but we 're lookin ' forward to it . " Burt Danby said , " Hey , Stud . Listen . Strooby here has a couple of the niftiest damn teen-age boys you 'll ever meet . Really a nifty couple of kids . Chip and Clipper . Thirteen and fourteen . Terrific sailors and plenty good at paddle tennis . " That was good , I said . " Oh , hell , they 're sports fans , all right , " said Strooby McMackin . " They read Sports Illustrated from cover to cover every month , and of course they do n't miss a Colgate game . I was Colgate ' Fifty-one . " No kidding , I said . Burt Danby said , " Stud , I know you want to relax , and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to Chip and Clipper on this menu from the Senor Sombrero Cafe . Just anything . Hi , Chip and Clipper , all the best , from the All-Pro himself , Billy Clyde Puckett . ' Anything at all . " Strooby McMackin said , " Hell , they 'll put that right up on their wall with the poster of Robert Redford . " Then he said , " Puckett , I really do feel badly about being so shit-faced the other night . I was totaled , believe me . And Burt knows that I can usually outdrink anybodyat the Creek or Twenty-One or the Frog , or any-where . " I wrote something fast on the menu to Clip and Chipper , or maybe it was the other way around . " Super , " said Burt Danby , slapping me on the bare200 PART THREE GAME-FACE 201back . It stung , as a matter of fuckin ' fact . I could n't resist asking the president of Kentuckian Cigarettes , since he had n't mentioned it , if he recognized that girl with Shake Tiller the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara Jane Bookman . " Yeah , " he said . " That was , uh , who was that ? " I took considerable delight in telling him that she was the girl in all of his Kentuckian ads right now , on all of the signboards and on the backs of magazines . " The hell she is , " he said . " Well , that just goes to show you how much a president knows . " " Plenty good-looking girl , " said Burt Danby . " And the ad 's a real winner , Stroob . Our creative guys just did a super job . " I said she worked a lot at what she does and that she might be the most familiar girl in advertising . I said she had been the Ford Fatigue Girl and the Chrysler CatastropheGirl and the Mercury Malaria Girl . Strooby McMackin said , " Well , I 'll have to keep an eye out for her . Say , Burt . If this girl 's working for me and she 's a Giant fan , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . " Burt Danby looked at me and said , " Is he a top guy ? You 're too much , Stroob . You really are . " They said they had to go . " Have a good game , Puckett , " said Strooby McMackin . " And may the best team win . " " As long as it 's us . " I smiled . Burt Danby whooped . " Is that something , Stroob ? Is that positive enough ? " As they left Burt Danby turned back toward me and gritted his teeth and made a gesture with his doubled-up fist like he was hitting somebody in the stomach . " Let 's get ' em good , " he said . I said O.K. I 'd get ' em if he would . I think I 've just heard Shake and Barbara Jane and Cissy come in . So I guess this is all the news for now from Walter Cronkite . I 'll try to get up early enough tomorrow morning to share a few experiences from Elroy 's party with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team . Might help me calm down some to get up early and do that . Do n't know as though I 'll be able to sleep much anyhow . As Shoat Cooper says about big games , " I believe I see in the papers where we got us a damned old formal dance comin ' up . " We sure do , if there is any truth in all captivity . And old Billy Clyde is gon na be asked to dance ever dance . Hit them biscuits with another touch of gravy , Burn that sausage just a match or two more done . Pour my black old coffee longer , While that smell in gettin ' stronger , A semi-meal ai n't nuthin ' much to want . Loan me ten , I got a feelin ' it 'll save me , With an ornery soul who do n't shoot pool for fun , If that coat 'll fit you 're wearin ' , The Lord 'll bless your sharin ' A semi-friend ani't nuthin ' much to want . Andlet me halfway fall in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-pretty woman in my arms . Yes , I could halfway fall in deep  --  Into a snugglin ' , lovin ' heap , With a semi-pretty woman in my arms . The stereo in our palatial suite is turned down fairly low so that nobody can get waked up by Elroy 's singing , or my own humming . That 's while I sit here in the early dawn on Super Bowl day and try to believe what I 'm looking at , which I hope will cure my headache . Reading from left to right on the coffee table in the living room here , we 've got  --  let me see  --  a cold bottleGAME-FACE 203of Coors , a pot of hot coffee , a tall glass of milk , a tall glass of tomato juice , a pitcher of ice water and a small bottle of Anacin . I have gone up and down the row a couple of times and it 's beginning to help a little bit . Not much . But I 'm not dead , at least . I ought to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dead for drinking up a young Pacific Ocean full of Scotch . And I ought to be dead from being shot , for having drank it the night before the Super Bowl . When this book comes out about seven or eight months from now , Jim Tom old buddy , nobody is going to believe what they read about the things which happenedthe night before the biggest sports event of the year . It was stronger than a used-up high school date is all it was . As parties go , I suppose Elroy 's would have to rate right up there with Hurricane Carla . When the four of us got there it was just about dark and the party obviously had already started . We had to park about two blocks away but we could hear some music and hollering without any strain . Elroy had rented one of those semi-castles in Bel Air , up there near the golf course . It was one of those old stone mansions that look like somebody in the family went crazy and got sealed off in one wing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and a big old yard , and a big old swimming pool , and a lot of big old eucalyptus trees , and it was all lighted up. 204 PART THREE The first thing we noticed when we walked into the yard was about two hundred people we had never seen before . It probably would have looked like a costume party to most people from Fort Worth . The guys were dressed like everybody from Jesus Harold to John Wayne . And the girls who were n't dressed like Indian princesses or bathing beauties or rodeo trick riders were dressed like light hooks . Which was with short , tight skirts , high heels , squeezed together lungs and sullen faces . Pretty visible through it all , however , was an awful lot of southern California witch wool  --  stewardi , semi- starlets , or whatever they were  --  who were running around acting like Elroy 's hostesses . The reason they were visible is because they were n't wearing anything but man-sized white T-shirts with some blue and red printing on them . The T-shirts said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by nothing on underneath the T-shirts , is nothing but skin and wool . Which a man could easily tell when one of them bent over or sat down , or when a man simply stared at the various feasts of lungs which jiggled and poked around in the semi-thin T-shirts . At first , we just kind of explored . We were looking to see where everything was . Food and drinks were almost everywhere , indoors and outdoors . A big old buffet of barbecued ribs  --  Texas style , which means smoked and not chinked  --  was stretched all across a part of the back lawn . A slightly smaller one was in the living room . GAME-FACE 205The living room looked like some kind of fuckin ' cathedral with a big old pointed ceiling and paintings hanging everywhere of a bunch of guys who looked like they used to be Popes but were n't . Or some kind of Frenchmen . There was a bar with a bartender in every room , includingthe semi-huge bathroom off of what I think was a master bedroom upstairs in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was about fifty feet long with a fireplace across one wall , a lot of bookshelves , and a big old desk with several Academy Award statues on it . There was also a big painting of a pretty lady . And a bed the size of Fuller Junior High . The bathroom off of it looked like Greece , or what I guess Greece looks like . It had a big old step-down marble tub , a waterfall , two or three basins , a stereo , a color TV , a leather chair , some statues of studs and goddesses , thick carpet , a balcony , and a fishing stream . A few times while we were milling about , some of those T-shirted little dandies with the no-panties and the dinner lungs came up to us and chatted . One that came around was about twenty-two , I 'd say , and had long black hair and big blue eyes . She also had a big , blue homemade cigarette in her hand about the size of a pregnant Winston . She said we could all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tops of the silver trays next to the ribs on the buffet tables . She said the name for this kind of anti-God cigarette206 PART THREE GAME-FACE 207was a " Waimea Rush , " but in New York they probably called it a " Village Lunch . " Or used to , she said . She was pretty enough to make our traveling squad , I thought . Not the team 's . Ours . Me and Shake 's . She said her name was Linda and she mostly skied at Aspen and mostly surfed at Waimea Bay and mostly danced at the Ho Chi Minh Trail . She said she flew for Pacific Basin Airlines and she lived at the Sunset BoulevardTowers  --  five four two , eight six three one  --  and that she mostly liked to smoke dope and talk nasty and fuck athletes . " What do you do for fun ? " Barbara Jane asked her . There was another one who came up to us and had blond hair going off in different directions and a pair of funny glasses on her nose and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that she had gone a year to UCLA , a year to the University of Texas , a year to Radcliffe and two years to a lettuce farm in Salinas . She said Zebba Den Karab had a better idea about things than Jesus Christ or even Hitler , who was grossly misunderstood , she said . She said she did n't like Europe any more because it was trying too hard to " catch up . " She said Rippy , Iowa , had it all over Europe . She said the best thing about the South Seas was to go there and get tremendously sunburned and have somebodybeat on your back with long , wet leaves . She wanted to know if Barbara Jane or Cissy wanted to eat her . She said she had chocolate candy , marshmallows , peanut butter and buttered popcorn in her " fun kit . " She was n't bad-looking for an intellectual . Shake Tiller asked her , " Where 'd Zebba Den Karab wind up after he lost his kickin ' foot and the Cowboys traded him ? " Felicia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wandered off into the night with the rib in her mouth . There was another one that was real healthy-looking . She was a bit meatier than the rest , and taller . Being taller , her T-shirt did n't hang down quite far enough to cover up her wool more than halfway . She had strong thighs and strong arms but she was semi-inviting for the man who sometimes gets in the mood for a gold medal swimmer . She said her name was Nancy and she was studying to be a nurse . Nancy said the party seemed pretty dull to her . Nobodywanted to do anything , she said , but eat and drink and smoke dope , which was corny . Or stand around and pose and make silly talk . There was nobody " alive , " she said . " Nothing is happening . " I could n't help but ask Nancy what was wrong with dope and booze and music and sex . " Easy for you to say , " she said . " What about the rest of us ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . What about her , I asked , in all seriousness . " Look , I 've been here maybe three or four hours , 208 PART THREE right ? " she said . " And there are , maybe , fifty or a hundred guys around , fair ? Fifty or a hundred ? " O.K. , I said . " Well , I must have asked at least half of them to come have some fun with me , and not one has taken me up on it , " said Nancy . Me and Shake asked about the same time what Nancy had wanted those chaps to do . " Just something that would please me , that 's all , " she said . Shake said he did n't see how that ought to be a prob- lem at all . I did n't , either . I do remember at this point that Barbara Jane was smiling at us and saying , " Boy , you guys are dumb . " Nancy went on , " Nobody knows where it 's at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see part of it . " Nancy scoffed and said that figured . We were just like all the others . Selfish . Crude . Insensitive . Unimaginative . She looked at us and said , " Do n't you know what 's fun for a woman ? Look , I 'll tell you . Have you been up to the master bedroom ? " We said yeah . " Have you seen the bathroom off of it ? " she said . We said yeah . " The thing that would most turn me on , " she said , " would be to get naked and stretch out in that marble tub and have six guys come in and do the number . " Could she be a little more explicit , Shake said . " Christ , " she said . " The world is really a goner . I 'll GAME-FACE 209spell it out , O.K. ? Look , I want to get in that marble tub and simply stretch out and let six guys piss on me . What else ? " Barbara Jane busted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a kind of little old spook-rhythm dance step . " All right , " Barb said . Me and Shake looked at Nancy . I guess I was thinking what a shame it was to see that gold-medal body wasted . Shake finally said , " I think we can turn this party around for you if we can find a friend of ours here named T. J. Lambert . " I just had to run off to the phone there for a minute . It was that Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Jim Tom Pinch who said he wanted to know how I felt and what was going through my mind on the morning of the big game . " I was only trying to remember what color the dog-ass Jets wear , " I said . " Do n't they wear green ? " Jim Tom said he thought so . " I believe that 's Baylor 's color , too , is n't it ? " I said . Jim Tom said it was last week . " Well , " I said , " how in the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team that wears the same goddamn color as Baylor ? " Jim Tom Pinch said I sure sounded like I got a lot of rest last night . " Hey , Stud , " he said . " Ca n't you get somebody around there to draw you a warm tub of Visine ? " 210 PART THREE GAME-FACE 211I asked Jim Tom how it was going in Fort Worth with Crazy Iris and the Port Lavaca Sandcrabs and the lovely and charming Earlene Padgett . " I 'm more concerned about the book , " Jim Tom said . " Have you got lots of stuff on tape ? " I said I was the most prolific mother he 'd come across since Big-un Darley . " How 's the detail ? " he asked . " Got lots of insights ? " I said that I had paid a particular mind to detail . That I had made absolutely certain that whenever I had a young Scotch and water it was either J &B; or White Label . " Paschal win big in last night 's semi-final against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses with a bandana tied around his head , " Jim Tom said . I asked who Paschal played tonight . " Paschal plays Astronaut Jones . Jones plays the Port Lavaca Sandcrabs , who beat the Itasca Wampus Cats like they were fags , " Jim Tom said . Paschal got a chance , I wondered . " About as much chance as they 'd have against Africa , " Jim Tom said . " Port Lavaca took the precaution of bringing along some seven-foot Mau Maus . " No chance , I said . Right ? " Did a one-legged man ever win an ass-kickin ' contest ? " Jim Tom said . My collaborator said his home life was going along pretty smooth . Earlene had only broken a clock radio lately , throwing it at him , and broken a window pane in the bedroom , throwing a jar of cold cream at him . " Sounds like you might have been seen in the company of Crazy Iris , " I said . " I do n't think you ought to go on those midday picnics down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive by . " Jim Tom said that what happened was , he 'd been with Crazy Iris and got home at four in the morning , drunk , and that Earlene had got up ahead of him and found his underwear stuck in the pocket of his sports coat . I asked what his explanation had been . " I said they were n't mine and I did n't understand the question , " Jim Tom said . " Well , " I said , " that certainly would have satisfied me if I 'd been your wife . " Jim Tom said , " Stud , do n't let anybody ever tell you that marriage is n't the greatest thing there is . By God , it beats being blind and crippled any time . " I said I had to go hold my head . Besides that , I was writing on a book . And , oh , yeah , I had a game to play . " Keep in mind that it 's a whole lot better book if you studs win that game , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You think you 'll just bring all the tapes down here or something after the game ? " he asked . " Not immediately after , " I said . " But eventually . " " Then you 're definitely coming down to Fort Worth ? " he said . " After I rest , " I said . " I got some things to do and some places to go , but I 'll get down there and we can go over everything and you can type it up and we 'll get it to the publishers in time for it to come out next season . " 212 PART THREE GAME-FACE 213Jim Tom said , " By the way , did some goofy woman interview you out there ? " I said yeah . " She called me and interviewed me , too , " Jim Tom said . " Sounded like some kind of semi-intellectual or something . " " She thought , " I said . " What 's that for ? " Jim Tom said . " I do n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I gave her a lot of shit . " Jim Tom said , " Did she ask if you ever had any bestial tendencies off the field ? " I said , " Aw , she wanted to know what went through my mind when I took a handoff and what sign I was born under and what I thought about the condition of the athlete 's mind . That kind of shit . " Jim Tom said , " I think she might be well knownaround New York . In those literary circles and so forth . " " She was a cunt , " I said . " I met her in the PoloLounge over at the Beverly Hills and she had a cup oftea and said hello to a whole bunch of hebes with tans . " " Was her name Cynthia Harnett ? " Jim Tom asked . " Maybe , " I said . " Hard-hitter , " Jim Tom said . " Just a Stove with a lot of lip , " I said . " Big timer , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " Well , she did seem a little disappointed that I was n't more impressed with her . She seemed to throw out a lot of first names of guys that I would n't haveknown their last names . She kept saying she did n't know anything about sports . I think she said something about sports being the intellectual enema of Western Man . " Jim Tom said , " So you fucked her , right ? " I laughed . " No , I just breathed heavy and looked off a lot and acted weary and concerned about the ball game , " I said . " She felt my arm once , though , so I guess that was an indicator . " Jim Tom said he had to go rewrite some of Big-un Darley 's headlines and I said I still had to hold my head . He said good luck in the game and I said we needed thirty-five points more than luck . To get back to the party , we finally found Elroy under a tree with his guitar in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you again , friends , that it 's entirely possible for a man to experience an orgasm with his eyes open despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary , " Elroy was saying . " Now you take these two volunteer couples that have just joined us , " he said . " I 've asked these kind people to be here tonight at their own expense to prove my point . " I 'd like for you to meet Mr. and Mrs. Harless Wilburnfrom Boise , Idaho , on my left , and Mr. and Mrs. Pervis MacAdoo from Hiroshima , New Mexico , on my right , " Elroy said . " No applause , please , until they 've finished the dem-214 PART THREE GAME-FACE 215onstration , " he said . " Too many things in this world go easily rewarded . But that 's another story . Maybe not . Maybe it 's part of this one . We 'll see . " Elroy played a chord on his guitar and said , " Now , then , Mr. and Mrs. Wilburn and Mr. and Mrs. MacAdoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to explain to the audience a little something about how important food is to being able to have an orgasm with your eyes open . " " A proper diet might be the most important thing of all . " Shake grinned . Elroy said , " Would you care to rephrase that ? " " Not at the time being , " said Shake . " May I continue ? " said Elroy . " Only if you want to , " Shake said . " I thought you 'd see it my way , " said Elroy . " I certainlythought somebody would . I knew it probably would n't be the Texas Rangers or the FBI , but I thought somebody would . " Shake said , " Your well-taken point before you were interrupted , sir , was food . " Elroy said , " Yes , food . And about goddamn time , too . Where in the hell are all the pork chops and where 's the biscuits ? " Barbara Jane held up her hand . " Who 's that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand up ? You 're a pretty thing , Mrs. MacAdoo . Ever fool around ? " Barb said , " Sir , I was wondering if you wanted us to demonstrate the warming-up process with or without props ? " Elroy took an inhale of a pregnant blue Winston and strummed a chord on his guitar . " That all depends on what the props are , " he said . " Props differ around the country . In some cities I lecture in , barbed wire is considered a prop . In other cities , barbed wire is only considered to be wire , with barbed on it . " Barbara Jane said , " Yes , I think we 've all had the same basic experience . It 's the same thing you find with thirteen-year-old nymphomaniacs . " " Not quite , " said Elroy . " With thirteen-year-old nymphomaniacs , you find many , many more men who ca n't stand up straight . That 's one of the myths of **29;14253;TOOLONG . " Barbara Jane said , " Would you care to elaborate , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd be most happy to elaborate because I think this subject is grossly overlookedin most of our classrooms today . It 's a subject that America has been silently brooding over far too long , and it 's groups like this one , which are forming all over the country , that will help to educate the broader pockets of misunderstanding that you find in the Midwest , the North , the East and parts of Louisiana . Thirteen-year-old nymphomaniacs ought to be eat more . " He said , " Now then . What exactly was my original subject ? " " Food . " Shake laughed . " Little girls , " said Barbara Jane . " Swallow ' em both , " said Elroy . I 'm afraid that as we all sat there on the grass some216 PART THREE GAME-FACE 217of those homemade cigarettes made the rounds . We partook of some , I 'll have to confess . Mainly , I believe , because we felt they would enhance the flavor of the barbecued ribs . It turned out that Elroy did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyhow . Somebodysaid the debutantes ate them all , or stole them for their kids and dogs . Incidentally , I only smoke that trash every now and then . Dope , I mean . Not kids and dogs . I would like for the youth of America to understand that old Billy Clyde prefers a young Scotch any old time to what you call your joints , although I think joints are fairly harmless and wo n't make you any kind of major league A-dict like the State of Texas says . Of course at Elroy 's party I had both . What happened was , I started out on a young Scotch and decided I had n't ought to drink so much before a game . Seeing as how it was a party , however , I wanted to enjoy myself to take my mind off the game . So I went to joints . But that only made me hungry and I did n't want to log up on too many ribs , so I went back to Scotch to keep from eating . And by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just drank myself into a street rummy , which is how I am now with my hang-over . If a stranger walks through the living room in a minute , I 'll try to borrow a quarter and go downstairs and lay down on the curb . Shit , I feel awful . But back to the party . I guess we sat around with Elroy under the tree with those other folks for another hour or so before it got sorowdy , and these curious things happened that nobody might believe . I think it was after quite a while , and all of us had started to get tired of listening to Elroy , that this photographercame up . Elroy said he wanted a photographer there to take some pictures for his den , and maybe something for an album jacket . Anyhow we were all still sitting there on the lawn and jabbering and giggling when we noticed that one of the supposedly straight girls at the party  --  meaning a nondebutanteor somebody without one of Elroy 's T-shirts on  --  had gone over to pose for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was wearing a headband and a lot of suede stuff with fringe on it . Good-looking sumbitch . Black hair . Kind of tiny . Smartasslooking . Semi-mean . Anyhow , the next thing we knew the Indian princess had slipped out of all but her hip-grabbing suede pants and her headband . Which meant that she was displaying her lungs for the photographer and smiling . Apparently she was drunk or stoned . What she would do , anyway , was hold her suede top in front of her lungs and then she would drop it down and reveal her lungs to the crowd  --  and the photographer  --  like it was a big deal for anybody to see her lungs . A lot of dumb-asses gathered around and applauded and shouted when the Indian princess dropped the top of her suede deal down , and tried to look sultry . We watched for a few minutes and Barbara Jane , who218 PART THREEby now had jacked her own head around a little , said , " If I could stand up I 'd give ' em a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Damn right . Me , too . " Elroy Blunt said , " Yeah , I 'm always hearin ' that big talk in my travels but nobody ever backs it up . " Barbara Jane said , " Yeah , well , if I could stand up , you 'd see , boy . " I said it was a good thing she could n't . Elroy said , " What would you do for us , little lady ? Would you do your panty hose commercials , or just what ? " " You 'd see , " said Barb , kind of giggling . " Damn right , " said Cissy . " Barbara and I could outlung that girl , anytime . Did I say that right , Billy ? Outlung ? " That was about the best thing I 'd ever heard Cissy say . Elroy said , " Well , I been on six or eight continents , even some nobody knows about . I been to a shrub-judgin ' and seen a queer there and I been to a football game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sumpter and I 've stepped across the Main Street of Selma with niggers on it . But I ai n't ever seen no New York model show her dandy old lungs in public . And I ai n't ever seen a society girlie from Long Island do it . That 's somethin ' I 'd like to see . " He said , " Of course , I do n't know about ever-body else . " Barbara Jane said , " If I could stand up , you 'd see plenty . " Elroy said , " Maybe we got some volunteers aroundGAME-FACE 219here to help these two lovelies get up on their feet . How ' bout it ? Anybody else want to look at some new tit-ties ? " Nobody said anything . Just chuckled . " Oh , well , " said Elroy . " It 's probably not important . I guess a society girlie 's lungs and a New York model 's lungs are pretty much like everybody 's . " Barbara Jane had been lying down on the lawn with her head propped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She started trying to sit up . " I tell you what , " said Elroy . " Why do n't we just get old Clyde and old Shake ' Em Up , Shake Loose here to describe to us what the lungs of these servin ' wenches look like in the shower ? " " Nope , " said Barb , struggling up to her feet with a young Scotch in her hand . " It 's something we really ought to share with the world at long last , " she said . " Right , Cissy ? " Cissy Walford said , " Terribly absolutely . Goddamn right . " Barbara Jane was wearing a flowered semi-Western shirt that fit tight and had long sleeves and buttoned up the front , and she was wearing snug , faded Levi 's that clung to her hips without a belt . Cissy was wearing an apron , more or less , so far as I could tell , that was covered with real jewels over a pair of pants that looked like bikini bottoms , or fit like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath a head scarf and she had on great big funny-shaped dark glasses and rawhide boots that came up to her knees.
