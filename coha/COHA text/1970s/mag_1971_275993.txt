Senescent Saint " Tell me , do you think your old man has slipped his trolley-that he belongs in a laughing academy ? " The old man is Joseph P. Kotcher. the academy is an old folks home , and the question is rhetorical . In Kotch , Walter Matthau plays a septuagenarian of shrewd independence ; he has no intention of fading slowly into the sunset years . Because , among other offenses , he leaves the toilet seat up , Kotcher is eased out of his son 's bickering household in Los Angeles and takes off for the Northwest , sightseeing and being lovable . Mostly being lovable . Wiping children 's noses , helping strangers , and finally befriending a pregnant teenager ( Deborah Winters ) , he is a regular saint of senescence , the sort of chap who could have made Walt Disney queasy . <P> Winters is one of the few young actresses with comic timing , and Matthau gives a carefully detailed impersonation of a Californian slipping into his anecdotage . He is both abetted and hindered by his director , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first worked together as fellow actors in Fortune Cookie and consolidated their partnership in The Odd Couple . Lemmon obviously has great affection for his sidekick ; in 114 minutes , the star is hardly ever offscreen . <P> But in his incessant concern to keep Matthau beautiful , Lemmon takes away dimension from everyone but Winters . Kotch 's children are Punch and Judy , and his neighbors caricatures . Moreover , the soupy conclusion tends to weaken all that went before . Kotch is " family " entertainment , but in its anxiety to please , it eventually cloys . It is a yes-man of a movie that Joseph P. Kotcher would have disdained . <P> S.K.
