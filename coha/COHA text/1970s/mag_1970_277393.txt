Speaking at the annual dinner of the Pilgrims , an Anglo-American society , in London , Britain 's Prince Charles tried to keep a straight face while defending the reputation of " my **41;259;TOOLONG George III . " His ancestor , he said , " consoled himself over the loss of the American colonies with the conclusion that more advantages were to be reaped from their trade as friends rather than as colonies .
