Gradually Michael works Jane over to the altarpiece where , as yesterday , the young Italian girl is working . Jane is preparing to praise the Madonna and Child altarpiece when she suddenly recognizes the Italian girl . She gasps : &nbsp; JANEOh ! And hides her face behind Michael 's back to hide her shock and surprise . Michael then knows for sure that what he is seeing is no apparation or trick of an old man 's foolish mind .
