FURTIVE nocturnal phone calls from strangers offering secret documents . Eager editors excitedly following terse instructions to pick up bags containing thousands of photocopied pages . Nimble newsmen frantically rushing exclusive disclosures into print . Harassed Government attorneys chasing into court to enjoin one series of revelations , only to see another break out elsewhere . A bemused federal judge wondering if the Justice Department might not be swatting futilely at " a swarm of bees .
