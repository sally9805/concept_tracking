At the 75th Precinct station house on Robert H. Torsney Sutter Avenue , to which the murder suspect , Robert H. Torsney , was assigned , his fellow officers were shocked . He was not " trigger-happy , " they said , and he had never made racial slurs .

' And the cop walked up- to him and said ' Damned right , ' then shot him in the head . " His friend fell , young Williams added , " and the cop walked over and flashed a flashlight in Randy 's face , then turned , walked to the curb and started running toward the car , " Other policemen had reported only that there had been a brier conversation , which they had not heard , and that Officer Torsney had then pulled his revolver and shot the youth once .
