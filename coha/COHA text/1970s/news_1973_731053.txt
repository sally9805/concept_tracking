txt A Federal investigation has begun into charges that high officials of the Department of Housing and Urban Development violated the law by appointing polite ical favorites to career civil service jobs . Two teams of investigators , one from the Civil Service Commission and the other from within H.U.D. , have been interrogating employes across the country and scouring the files for incriminating mernorandums and letters for the last five weeks . Employes of the . department have charged that departmental officials , including W. Stanley Armstrong , special assistant to the Secretary , have secured high salaried and influential jobs in local housing agency offices for political favorites of the Nixon Administration . Unequaled ' In 35 Years ' " We were n't aware of any such acts before the civil service came in , " said James A. Wilderotter , executive assistant to Secretary James T. Lynn . " These charges are very serious , " he added . One apparent victim of the actions under investigation was transferred out of his regional post last year to make room for a new man named by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal service , " he said ; " I 've never seen any , thing to equal " this change-. over . Mr. Armstrong , whir ; refused to- comment on thee , charges ; and other unidentified tifficii4li of the department are L ... ileing // investigated for possible violations of the Pendleton Act , which established the system of non political appointments to career civil service jobs . Most of the 16,000 employes of H.U.D. are career civil servants , including 86 area directors . Department employes say that most of the area directors are now persons appointed in this Administration . Mr. Wilderotter said that the department had undergone four reorganizations in the last four years and that many vacancies had thereby been created in field offices . In response to rumors in the department that some persons involved in the program had been dismissed , Mr. Wilderotter said that Secretary Lynn , who is out of the country , had not yet dismissed anyone . " When the civil service came in , Secretary Lynn ordered our inspector general , Charles G. Haynes , to begin his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the inspector general completes his investigation , the Secretary will take the appropriate action . " ' Best People ' Sought Mr. ' Wilderotter said , " The Secretary has been trying to get the best people in these incredibly important positions . He does n't care if they are Democrats , Republicans , Tories or Whigs . " " This thing , is diverting us from our work on the Better Communities Act and the housing study , " Mr. Wilderotter said . " It ' takes so much time and gives our opponents a chance to inject criticism . " At one local H.U.D. office in the South recently a visitor found secretaries chatting about new hair styles for lack of work . The director explained that since , the investigation be.gan little direction had come from Washington and work was at a standstill . Political ' patronage jobs are not new to the housing department or any other agency . As Donald Fielding , , a former director of the department 's Tampa office , explained in a telephone interview : " I knew I was politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Democratic appointee . When I got a call telling me to report to Atlanta , that I was through in Tampa , back in 1970 , I recognized it as a political fact of life . " Job With Paper Clips " They expected me to resign , " said Mr. Fielding , who was a career civil servant for more than 10 years . " But even though I was a Democrat I thought they could use my knowledge and expertise . " I pushed paper clips in Chicago for 22 months where I got a new title , special assistant for program coordination , " Mr. Fielding said . " I never could find out what I was supposed to be doing . They just pulled the job out of thin air . " Mr. Fielding ' resigned in the spring of 1972 when he concluded that he would never be offered another important position . " I was disappointed ; but it was n't unusual . There were a lot of us . " Mr. Fielding has not been questioned by investigators , however , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Armstrong , the special assistant to Secretary Lynn , replaced C. March Miller 2d , who handled personnel reform for the department. - Mr . Miller , now the director of the Office of Unsubsidized Insured Housing Programs , declined to answer any questions about the investigation .
