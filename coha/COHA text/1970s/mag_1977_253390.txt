Down with expense accounts , off with capital gains <P> " Our national tax system is a disgrace . Basically , I favor a simplified tax system that treats all income the same , taxes all income only once , and makes our system of taxation more progressive . " <P> That was one of Jimmy Carter 's key campaign promises last year , and the time is coming to deliver on it . A task force that started work last winter ( TIME , July 4 ) has placed on Carter 's desk a loose-leaf notebook with some 150 pages of recommendations . Barring an unforeseen delay , the President expects to present to Congress by Oct. 6 his choices from among those recommendations . Aides are billing the program as the most comprehensive and drastic revision of the nation 's income tax laws since the modern system was set up in 1913 . About 1,000 items of the tax code would be changed or eliminated-almost one change for each of the code 's 1,100- odd pages . <P> The drafting of the proposals was largely overseen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country to gauge public sentiment at give-and-take sessions . Carter himself has boned up carefully on tax reform . During the summer he summoned Blumenthal , Assistant Treasury Secretary Laurence N. Woodworth , Chief Economic Adviser Charles Schultze and a few other selected staffers to three sessions in the White House , lasting a total of seven hours . <P> Now the President must check the boxes for yes or no decisions . While some of his choices remain in doubt , the outline of his program seems well set . Major points : <P> Tax rates will be cut for individuals and corporations alike . The highest bracket of personal taxation-which applies to so-called " unearned " income , such as dividends , interest and rents - would be reduced from 70% to 50% . The top rate of 50% on " earned " income - primarily salaries-would be reduced ; the lowest rate would be cut from 14% to 10% , and there would be decreases in all brackets in between . The corporate rate , now 48% of profits in most cases , would be reduced significantly , perhaps by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - $10 billion for individual taxpayers , $5 billion for corporations . <P> Capital gains would be taxed as ordinary income . At present , only half the profit on sale of stock , real estate or other assets held for nine months or more is usually subject to tax . To soften the blow , exceptions would be made for family homes and family farms . The change would be phased in over several years , and people selling assets at a loss would be allowed to write off more of that loss against other income . Cities and states could continue to issue bonds paying interest that is exempt from federal tax , but they would get a federal subsidy to encourage them to issue bonds that would not qualify for tax exemption . The subsidy might amount to 35% to 40% of the higher interest rate that would have to be offered .
