txt Letters to the Editor Letters to the Editor To Defuse Population Bomb To the Editor : How convenient it would be if the population bomb was of the kind that could be defused by a few experts tinkering with the mechanism . Demographers ' projections are naturally subject to error , as are most attempts to predict human behavior far into the future . Your editorial of Oct , 17 , however , implies that all will be well if the prediction of 300 million Americans in the year 2000 proves to be on the high side . Few will ' deny that nearly every environmental and social problem is aggravated , if not directly caused , by increasing numbers of people . If the current rate of growth continued , the U.S. population would double in about seventy years . We are pleased and encouraged at any signs that this rate is slowing , but we dare not become complacent about . the situation until our average family size drops to a level that will permit longterm stability  --  not merely growth at a slightly reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population growth , which results basically from the fact that babies born in one boom create another when they reach the appropriate age . Frejka calculated that even if average family size in the U.S. were reduced , immediately , to only 2.1 children ( the number necessary to insure that each person is on average replaced by one descendant in the next generation ) , the U.S. population would not stop growing for about seventy years , and it would then be almost 40 per cent higher than it is now . Family size is still well above 21 , and probably over 2.5 , but a precise figure can be obtained- only in retrospect . The longer that this discrepancy persists , the larger our population will get before it stabilizes . Many people who are appalled by the inverse relation between quantity and quality of human life in many parts of the world feel that we must grasp the opportunity  --  denied to most countries ? to achieve an optimal To the Editor : Marjorie Hunter 's Nov. 5 news ate tide is certainly correct he reporting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being an incumbent . Yet the contests where incumbents lost show an interesting development . Between the primaries and the gen , eral ' elections , twelve incumbents with a total of 178 years of seniority and an average age of 61 were ' defeated by dovish challengers with an average age of 45.5 . Ten of the defeated Congressmen would be considered hawkish on national security issues : Adair , Ayres , Cowger , Fallon , Langen , , Mize , Philbin , Byron Rogers . and Schadeberg . The other two , Leonard . Farbstein and Sam Friedel , were products of big-city political machines with dovish voting records . Eleven of the challengers were elected in November , Craig . Barnes of Denver losing at that time . They include : Edward Roush , Indiana ; John Seiberling , Akron ; Ron Mazzoli , Louisville ; Parren Mitchell and Paul ' Sarbanes of Baltimore ; Robert Bergland , Minnesota ; John Dow , New York ; Dr. William Roy , Topeka ; Father Robert Drinan , Massachusetts ; Les Aspin ; Wisconsin , and Bella Abzug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way up in American politics : young , issues-oriented , reformminded , articulate , free from the patterns of the past . Of course , the loss of Allard Lowenstein and Daniel Button must be balanced against the victories mentioned above . Part of the legacy which they helped leave to others , Congressional reform ; will encourage the issuesoriented freshmen to be heard as well as seen . SANFORD GOTTLIEB Executive Director , SANE Washington , Nov. 9 , 1970 0 To the Editor : Now that the election is over I suggest that spokesmen for both major parties refrain from protestations that one party has gained and the other party has lost . The American people are quite capable of making their own assessment of the election results . These post-election allegations are fruitless and contribute nothing to the solution of the country 's ? problems . People might well bear in mind that where electioneering is concerned , men , as Dr. Johnson remarked regarding the composing of lapidary inscriptions , are not on their honor . Whether the election was a " tremendous success " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Times of Nov. 6 are expressions of partisan opinion . But the public is more interested in the Administration balance between population and resources . As you rightly state , the picture is much darker in the world as a whole . Our best chance to:aid in the colossal task of stopping population growth abroad is by our example at home . Only if we have an explicit and effective policy for achieving a zero growth rate in our own population of super-consuniers and super-polluters can we avoid charges of self-serving hypocrisy when we try to help other nations to stabilize their populations , and so to break the vicious cycle of malnutrition , inadequate education , unemployment , poverty and despair .

Oral Control of Diabetes To the Editor : As physicians concerned with the welfare of our patients , we want ' to reassure diabetics that they can safely continue to take oral medications for diabetes as prescribed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our patients . Unfortunately , a controversial , study of the University Group Diabetes aProgram ( U.G.D.P. ) , seeking to evalute the treatment of a chronic disease ( diabetes ) over a period of years , was fraught with statistical errors ; did not treat most of the patients as they are properly treated in practice , and sacrificed clinical judgments to meet the needs of computer analysis . It is noteworthy that the director of the Joslin Clinic of Boston , perhaps the leading diabetes center . in the world , has described the , U.G.D.P. study as " worthless " as a guide to therapy . Further the U.G.D.P. conclusions are in direct contradiction to ' longterm studies reported in the United States ( the 16-year U.S. Public Health Service , Framingham , Mass. , study ) , Great Britain ( the Bedford study ) , and Sweden ( Karolinska . Institute study ) . The value of oral treatment of diabetes continues to be supported by and the Congress getting at the root causes of our problems . After all , when the Administration seeks support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next Congress , we shall see who supports . what , and the wisdom of the pre-election forays of the President and Vice President will be tested . WILLIAM H. CHIUSTENSEN Grosse Pointe Woods , Mich . Nov. 6 , 1970 0 To the Editor : Now that returns on the ' voting for Senate candidates are complete , the meaning of the 1970 elections can be brought into clearer focus . The President 's claim of a crucial " ideological " victory is entirely correct . To identify the hard core of liberal opposition on domestic , issues , the Haynsworth-Carswell vote is as good a touchstone as any . Forty-six Senators voted against both of these nominees to the Court . ' Six of them , Senators Dodd , Goodell , ? TydineS , Gore , Yarborough , and Young , have been replaced by men more congenial to the President 's views on domestic affairs . The President lost ground in California and Illinois . Net gain : four votes , or five if a recount defeats Senator Hartke . The bare tally of victory and defeat does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Javits , Mathias and Saxbe ) have been put on probation by the defeat of liberal candidates in their home states . It may not be altogether unrealistic to anticipate a bit more party regularity in the stands these gentlemen will take on key issues . The 1970 elections to the Senate can not be construed as a " mandate " for the intensification of overspending on domestic social programs . This is clearly seen in the shaky margins of victory of four Democratic liberal incumbents , all of whom ought to have been easy winners in an off year : Hartke , Symington , Montoya , and . These four were returned to office by slim leads that totalled about 70,000 out of well over three million votes cast in their states . A shift to the Republican column of slightly more than 1 per cent , on the average , in those four states would have given control of the Senate to Mr. Nixon 's party . After ten years of getting the country moving  --  in the direction of ruinous inflation ? and warring on poverty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VAN LAER New York , Nov. 6 , 1970 most leading American specialists in diabetes . It is also significant that both the British Scowen Committee and the Canadian Food and Drug Directorate ? British and Canadian . counterparts of the Food and Drug Administration  --  studied the U.G.D.P. findings and concluded there was no need to change current modes of therapy . Thus , in our opinion  --  the controver- , slal study offers no realistic or meaningful guide to diabetes therapy despite reports in the press . At the time of this writing the study findings have still not been published and made available for detailed analysis by the scie entific community . As a result of leaks , press reports have contributed to needless patient ' hysteria  --  and panic . The hasty action of the Food and brug Administration in respect to the study has not helped either scientific deliberation ' or the treatment of diabetic patients . In fact , the F.D.A. action is difficult to under= stand because its own scientific advisory committee was sharply split , on the value and the scientific implications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an unconfirmed , contrc : versial epidemiologic study whose findings are not consistent either with other scientific studies or actuarial : data , or the experience of outstanding medical specialists should have con- ' fused instead of helped to clarify the problems of diabetic patients . It is a , matter of serious concern that such an , unconfirmed report has made it so dif- : ficult for physicians to care properly ' , for innocent diabetic patients and their bewildered families .

' Not a Working Number ' To the Editor : " When I call no one answers , " is the plaintive cry of Isaiah ( 50:2 ) . He might well have been ' reflecting the exasperation and resignation of today 's New Yorker , who dials a telephone number in the vain hope that his call might go through the first time . ' Last night offered the ultimate in telephonic decay . I dialed 411 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hum , heard ' - a sympathetic recorded voice saying : " I 'm sorry , the number you have , reached is not a wprking number ; please check the listing and . . . " I wonder what Isaiah would have said to that ? Rabbi HASKEL LOOKSTEIN New York , Nov. 9 , 1970 0 ? ' Game Plan ' Looks Good ? To the Editor : If many economists were not famil- ? iar with the standard economic ' , analysis of Prof. Raymond J. Saulnier ( Op . Ed. article Oct. 20 ) , they would have been , appalled to hear that , to his ' way of thinking , " the game plan of stabilization policies looks very good . " 4 His recommendation is to continue with more of the same , i.e. , tighter ' monetary policies . Then the game plan would not only be good but better . This means that , while unemploye ment rose from 3.5 ' per cent in January 1969 , to 5.5 per cent in September . 1970 ( 34 per cent among teen-age - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , 9.5 per cent . But the rate of inflation will decrease by another 1.5 per cent ( from 6 per cent to 4.5 per cent ) . Or does this imply an increase in the Federal budget deficit from the projected $12 billion-$20 billion to , say , $24 billion-$40 billion ? If housing starts were to follow the same " improved " trend , since 1970 housing " starts are about 10 per cent lower than that of 1960 , by 1980 we would ' have 20 per cent less , housing starts than in 1970 . If all this means that we will fare better , I can not help but hope for the worst . GUSTAV SCHACHTER . Professor of Economics ? Northeastern University Boston , Oct. 22 , 1970 0 Injustice to Landlords To the Editor : The Times reported Nov. 6 New , York City would pay 3.72 per cent interest on ' borrowings , yet the city not long ago increased the interest , rate on late payments of real estate ? taxes from 6 per cent to 12 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent , interest on overpayments of real estate taxes when courts reduce over- , assessments of property by the city . These are among the many injustices perpetrated by the city against . the landlord . This results in abandonment of rent-controlled apartment property and non-investment in apart- ? ment construction in New York City , both inflicting great harm on tenants and others in need of housing . - F.
