txt The Sunshine mine disaster in Idaho underscores anew the issue of mine safety in the United States . It took the Farmington , W. Va. , coal mine . explosion in 1968 , in which 78 miners were killed , to overthrow the old Coal.Mine Safety Act of 1952 . Now the Sunshine disaster , which has already killed more than two dozen and left 54 trapped , may mark the point at which the federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety and Health Act of 1966 will be overthrown , some believe . This act , not implemented until 1970 , is patterned after the archaic 1952 coal-mining act . Most of its provisions , critics say , point up the powerlessness of federal authorities to deal with violations . " If you can hit a coal-mine operator with a $2,000 penalty for allowing an im minent danger to exist  --  which you can  --  certainly you should be able to do the same for a metal-mine operator , " was an opinion expressed by one source involved in the 1966 legislation . In addition , violations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandatory and advisory , or " shall " and " should . " Under the upgraded coal-mine act of 1968 , there are no advisory regulations . Meanwhile , there are not enough mine inspectors in the U.S. ; there are only 100 Bureau of Mines inspectors for some 18,000 metallic and nonmetallic mine operations , including 3,000 underground mines . Several thousand inspectors are needed , says one Bureau of Mines spokesman . For example , an operation as big as the Sunshine mine , which is a producer of silver , lead , and copper , takes three days to inspect . The fire in the Sunshine mine has also brought up questions of mine ventilation , In fact , Sunshine-mine officials had their own doubts about ventilation and last September , requested that a Bureau of Mines team study its system . Although there have been many complaints about the 1966 health and safety law , Congress has not pressed to get it changed , Nor has the Bureau of Mines pressed for new legislation . The American Mining Congress , a spokesman for the industry , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to make on the adequacy of the safety act now governing non-coal mines .
