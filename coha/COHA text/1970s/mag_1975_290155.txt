Most executives would think at least twice before agreeing to take over the management of a multinational food company plagued by heavy losses , bitter internal feuds and a sensational international bribery scandal . When Wallace W. Booth was first offered the chief executive 's job at United Brands Co. two months ago , he promptly declined . Booth did not feel that his experience suited him for running a food company . During 20 years with Ford Motor Co. , he played a major role in setting up the company 's financial control system , became a director and eventually headed Ford 's Australian subsidiary . In 1968 Booth joined the Rockwell International Corp. , a Pittsburgh-based company that manufactures such durable goods as missiles and other space vehicles , gears , filters and textile machinery . <P> Second Wooing .

He had resigned as a senior vice president , director and member of the executive committee at Rockwell , where the chief executive was only two years older than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top , " Booth says . So when United Brands asked him a second time to head the company , he agreed , and last week was elected president . <P> Booth steps into one of the hottest spots in U.S. business . United Brands lost $47 million in 1974 ( on sales of more than $2 billion ) , as both of its main businesses-John Morrell &; Co. , a meatpacking firm , and Chiquita bananas - turned down . The losses were caused chiefly by Hurricane Fifi , which destroyed 70% of United Brands ' banana crops in Honduras , and a sharp rise in the cost of cattle feed . <P> The company has had no leader since the February suicide of Chairman Eli M. Black , who had created United Brands in 1970 by merging his own AMK Corp . with United Fruit Co . A Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Black 's death uncovered a $1.25 million bribe United Brands had paid to a high official in Honduras in order to win a reduction in export taxes on bananas ( TIME , April 21 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney in New York had subpoenaed documents relating to other possible payoffs in Italy , West Germany , Panama and Costa Rica . <P> Following Black 's death , a long-simmering power struggle on the 14-man board intensified . On one side were supporters of Norman Alexander , chairman of Sun Chemical Corp . and a longtime friend of Black 's who had joined the board to help find a successor . Opposing Alexander was a faction backing Edward Gelsthorpe , 53 , United Brands ' executive vice president and chief operating officer . He ran the Boston office and was the man considered most likely to succeed Black . As United Brands ' losses mounted , the two men clashed so often that Black threatened to fire Gelsthorpe.
