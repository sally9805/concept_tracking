The music suddenly slashes at the eardrums . The musicians , dressed in dashikis or undershirts , are bent into their efforts , sweating , their faces expressionless . Their sounds are warm and swirling , then frenetic , the horns bleating , the drummer flailing , the pianist pouncing intently at the keyboard . The tune is unidentifiable , the melody shattered into ravaged fragments , the rhythms complex and seemingly . beyond grasp . <P> That was the scene one recent evening at Slug 's in Greenwich Village East . The curious and compelling cacophony was being raised by what is known in jazz as " the New Thing . " Listening to it can stir confusions in the ear and mind . Is it jazz at all ? Is it hate music , love music , both or neither ? Or is it perhaps a deliberate attempt to antagonize the listener ? The answers to those questions largely depend on what the listener 's most cherished notions of jazz happen to be . <P> Taste and Love . Ever since Dixieland and ragtime , jazz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black American , when it was most free and spontaneous . By the middle 1950s , after swing and bebop , jazz was wedded to the classics through the progressive jazz of Brubeck , the Modern Jazz Quartet and others . It took on an increasingly formal , warmed-over character . At that moment , the need for the New Thing first stirred among future jazz movers like Alto Saxophonist Ornette Coleman , Pianist Cecil Taylor and Tenor Saxophonist John Coltrane . <P> Their goal was ambitious : to extend the language of jazz even farther than the progressives and , at the same time , restore its old freewheeling gut-blues intensity . Drawing on African primitivism , Mediterranean and Asian folk music , and sounding at times like Viennese atonalists , the new jazzmen vary tonal centers , when they are used at all , as often as they do moods . Basic rhythms , unavoidable before , are often merely implied or forgotten entirely now . But as Ornette Coleman says , " When it 's done with taste and love , hardly anybody would n't like it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thing have become heroes to pockets of admirers all over the world . But even after a decade , the new sound is still largely unfamiliar to many listeners . Uninhibited , impolite , impatient , the New Thing often seems intended only to disturb . One reason : it is as much involved with the pain of being black in the U.S. as Dixieland was with the exhilaration of marching in New Orleans parades . " To disturb people-at least what they mean by disturb-that 's the whole point , " says Sunny Murray , whose dense and relentless drumming is mind-riveting . For Coleman , it has nothing to do with conscious anger . " There 's anger , but the musician is not directing it at the audience . It 's anger directed at himself ; he 's playing about his own turmoil . " <P> It is music to encompass the total black experience , says Tenor Saxophonist Archie Shepp : " The field holler , the ring shout , * the sanctified church . That does n't exclude white people , but if white people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humility , " For Trumpeter Don Cherry , the music speaks most eloquently for the whole musician . " Man is a species , all human , " Cherry observes . " The rest is pastels . Beware of distractions . "
