LEGALLY or illegally , abortion is practiced in nearly every country in the world . In fact , more than half the world 's population lives in countries that permit abortion for social as well as medical reasons . <P> Perhaps the most permissive toward abortion is the Soviet Union , which passed an open abortion law ( virtually without restrictions ) in 1920 , years before any other country . To arrest a declining birth rate , the law was repealed in 1936-and then reinstated in 1955 . Similarly liberal laws were passed during the 1950s in many Communist countries of Eastern Europe ( Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Poland , Rumania and Bulgaria ) . Japan , too , has a permissive law , as do China and India . In the latter two countries , however , not everyone who wants an abortion can get one , simply because medical facilities are too few and often too far away for poor people to reach . <P> Laws are more restrictive , but increasingly flexible , in Scandinavia and Great Britain . In 1938 , Sweden became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the law has become increasingly permissive over the years . In addition to allowing abortion for medical , eugenic and ethical ( in cases of rape or incest ) reasons , Sweden now permits it to protect " mental health , " a term that can be broadly interpreted to justify abortion for almost any reason . However , the country requires a detailed investigation before permission is granted , and until 1965 permission was in fact denied in 20% to 40% of all cases . Now , however , the rate of refusal is much lower . <P> Most of the nations of Latin America have severely restrictive abortion laws on the books ; in fact , abortion is totally illegal , even on medical grounds , in Bolivia , Colombia , the Dominican Republic , Haiti , Guatemala and Panama . It is also banned outright , or only rarely permitted , in the predominantly Catholic countries of Europe , in most of the new African states , and in some Asian countries , among them Indonesia , Malaysia , Thailand and Taiwan . <P> Even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the Middle East-the operation is performed openly in clinics and hospitals . By contrast , abortions are performed clandestinely , but frequently , in many Latin American nations . Studies show that from 20% to 50% of all Latin American pregnancies are illegally ended .
