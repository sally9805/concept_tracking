What do you do when you find your daughter huddled in the back of her bedroom closet , taking a troublesome trip on LSD ? Or shacked up in the East Village with a Hell 's Angels cokehead ? Well , if you believe Eli Wallach and Julie Harris in The People Next Door , you blame older brother . You get mad at little sister . You get mad at the neighbors and at each other . And all the time you yell , yell , yell . In every way , The People Next Door is an anachronism , a " naturalistic " play like those prevalent in the 1950s . It ran on TV two years ago and has now been transported to the screen with every clich , every oversimplification , every gross dramatic blunder intact . <P> The subject , to be sure , is a serious one . But JP Miller , who wrote the similarly devious Days of Wine and Roses , is really not interested in it . What occupies his time is repeated and virulent attacks on youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unloving brats . There are a couple of cursory attempts to explain young people 's interest in drugs ( Mommy takes lots of pills , Daddy is a booze hound ) , but they all smack of smug rationalization . In the midst of all these dismal goings on are several fine actors yelling to get out . Wallach is brutal and forceful as the father ; Hal Holbrook , playing a next-door neighbor , is remarkably moving against overwhelming odds ; and the young actors-Deborah Winters , Stephen McHattie , Don Scardino-are a talented crew . The best of The People Next Door is the brilliant , low-key camera work of Gordon Willis , whose fine eye for color and composition enlivened other moribund exercises , like End of the Road and The Landlord . Perhaps Willis , instead of investing such care in this project , might better have shut off all the lights on the set and left The People Next Door , with its author , in total darkness . <P> Jay Cocks              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
