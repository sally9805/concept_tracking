Approved by the Senate 78-7 last week , Henry A. Kissinger was sworn in as the nation 's 56th Secretary of State-and the first naturalized U.S. citizen to hold that post . With his proud mother Paula , 73 , holding the Bible , Kissinger took the oath of office from Chief Justice Warren Burger while his father Louis , 87 , son David , 12 , and daughter Elizabeth , 14 , looked on . A beaming Nixon introduced the new top diplomat as a man of " poise , strength , and character . " <P> Kissinger , who with his German-Jewish family fled the Nazi regime in 1938 , responded by noting : " There is no country in the world where it is conceivable that a man of my origin could be standing here next to the President of the United States . And if my origin can contribute anything to the formulation of our policy , it is that at an early age I have seen what can happen to a society that is based on hatred and strength and distrust ... America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond itself . As we work for a world at peace with justice , compassion and humanity , we know that America , in fulfilling man 's deepest aspirations , fulfills what is best within it . "
