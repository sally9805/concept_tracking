 | How I Discovered Gravitational Waves Professor of Physics at the University of Maryland , Dr. Weber won the Gravity Research Foundation Award in 1959 . His work is funded partly by the National Science Foundation and partly by the University . Gravitation has always been the most mystifying force known to man . It is by far the weakest of the basic forces in the universe , ranking after the strong nuclear force , the electromagnetic force , and the weak interaction nuclear force . ( Gravitation is weaker than the last by a factor of 10 followed by 25 zeros . ) Yet the gravitational force is the one we are most familiar with ? on Earth , it governs the everyday behavior of commonplace objects ? and us ; in the heavens , it rules the stars in their courses . More than any other force , gravitation determines the structure and evolution of the universe . In 1916 , Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves , generated by accelerating bodies of enormous size . But Einstein believed the waves were so weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to another landmark in physics : The 19th century scientist James Clerk Maxwell orized the existence of then-unknown tromagnetic waves . When Heinrich turned Maxwell 's abstruse theory in dio waves in the laboratory in 1888 , a new age was born ? of radio , X rays , . the whole gamut of marvels we today . Now Einstein 's prediction , too , see be confirmed experimentally , and knows with what consequences ? Dr. seph Weber , after 10 years of tuning the galaxy , announced in 1969 that he no doubt that signals picked up by Ins tectors were gravitational waves . If it is indeed correct , and scientists here in the Soviet Union are working to firm his findings , then it is one of the A epochal discoveries in the history of ence , one that could force physicists to vise their most basic ideas about the no of the universe. ? The Editors When I decided to search for gravitational waves some 14 years ago , most physicists applauded our courage , but felt that success ? detection of gravitational radiation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we faced lay in the inherent weakness of gravitational force . This characteristic ruled out experiments in which gravitational waves would be generated and detected within the laboratory . With the normal experimental approach blocked , some other method of detection had to be found . The first step was to put pencil to paper . Using the most rigorous mathematics of Einstein 's relativity theory , which had predicted the existence of the waves , I was able to prove theoretically that an elastic solid , such as a metal bar , could serve as an antenna . If a gravitational wave were to pass through it , the bar would vibrate ever so lightly , and this vibration might be detected . Of course , the vibrations would be strongest when the frequency of the gravitational wave matched the resonant frequency of the antenna ? much as a tuning fork might pick up sound vibrations of proper pitch . Thus the antenna would measure the curvation of space-time , a highly abstract quality that plays a central role in Ei stein 's Relativity Theory . To plan the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a struse concept on a pen and ink recorder , I found extremely exciting I also knew that a large mass , such as the Earth or moon , might be u ful as a detector , or antenna , for xe low frequencies . The Earth resonates at one cycle every 54 minutes : much smaller moon has a resonance one cycle every 15 minutes . For hi i frequencies , on the order of thous. of cycles per second , a mass of a tons would make a suitable antenna I decided to develop the technology of using the Earth and moon detectors , while simultaneously wwu ing with laboratory-sized masses . With the collaboration of Dr. D. : M. Zipoy and Dr. Robert L. Forty I began antenna development 1959 . We first tried to use a gravim eter on Earth to detect certain brational overtones of our planet . gravimeter measures the accelerate of the Earth 's surface that would cur during a vibration . The graven ter we used had a sensitivity as hi as one part in 100 billion of g , g be i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments did not lead to success . We found that earthquakes , motion of the oceans , and the atmosphere generated small motions that interfered with measurements . This background " noise " severely limits the Earth 's usefulness as a detector of gravitational waves . A gravimeter on the moon , however , would not be subject to weather and oceanic disturbances , and might act as a good detector . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is preparing to put a gravimeter on the moon as part of the Apollo 17 mission . The bulk of our effort was aimed at developing a laboratory-sized antenna to detect gravitational frequencies in the 1,000-cycle ( kiloHertz ) region . Our antenna took the shape of a cylinder of solid aluminum about two feet in diameter and five feet long . It weighs 3,000 pounds , and hangs horizontally from a steel wire attached to special columns resting on acoustic filters that shield it from environmental disturbances . To pick up the vibrations of the aluminum cylinder , we bonded ferroelectric crystals to its surface . The slightest cylinder deformation creates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals are amplified electronically and activate a graphic recorder . The detector as a whole is so sensitive that the recorder 's pen responds to a vibration in the cylinder that is 1/100 the diameter of an atomic nucleus ! About this time we were encouraged by some theoretical studies made by Prof. Freeman J. Dyson . He analyzed what happens when large masses move at velocities close to the speed of light , a situation that can occur in a star that has consumed its nuclear fuel . Normally , the size of a r is determined by the balance of rtes : the gas pressure and pressure outward radiation created by nuear " burning , " and the inward force gravitation due to the star 's own ss . When the nuclear fuel burns , the radiation and gas pressure aken , and fail to offset the gravitanal force , so that the star begins collapse . If its mass is not too large , a collapsg star may evolve into a white dwarf , where pressure and gravitation are once more in balance . But if the star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its gravitational pull on its own matter overcomes all pressures and it continues to collapse at an accelerated pace . Most stars , like our sun , rotate slowly , and if the star collapses , its peripheral rotation increases ? much like a pirouetting skater who pulls his arms in to maintain his spin . Dyson calculated that when a star is in the process of collapsing , it emits gravitational waves . He also theorized that a pair of closely spaced neutron stars ( collapsed white dwarfs ) spinning about each other will lose energy in the form of gravitational waves , and the stars will come closer together . In each case , Dyson calculated that in the final moments of collapse , enormous energy is radiated away in a short burst of " unimaginable " intensity . This final gasp releases 100 times more energy than was generated by the star during its entire lifetime of several billion years . My thought was : How could gravitational waves generated by Dyson 's collapsing stars be detected ? Even if our antenna detected a pulse of gravitational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what it really was ? Many other events might generate spikes on the chart recorder : lightning , earthquakes , electrical power disturbances , radio and TV broadcasts , and cosmic ray showers . Even when the detector was isolated and shielded in a metal vacuum chamber , its sensitivity would enable it to pick up such disturbances . It occurred to me that the solution lay in using two detectors located at separate points . An environmental disturbance at one location would be @#  | recorded there , but not at the other location . Only when both detectors were simultaneously activated would an event be recorded . Separating the detectors makes nongravitational coincidences very unlikely . The greater the separation , the more likely that a coincident vibration is actually the result of a gravitational wave passing through space . After some preliminary experiments , two large detectors were constructed , one installed at the University of Maryland , the other at the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago , 600 miles away . To our amazement , the detectors picked up about one coincident signal every day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rule out one important possibility ? that what we were seeing was a large number of completely random coincidences ? unlikely , but possible . To check , we inserted a time delay in one detector 's recording channel . This would weed out all the coincidences caused by single external events . For example , suppose a gravity wave hit our detectors simultaneously at 10 a.m . Without the time delay , the two recorders would show a simultaneous peak . With the delay , one recorder would now show the peak at a later time ? no coincidence . But if there are large numbers of random , unconnected events producing the peaks , then inserting the time delay would not affect coincidence rate . The result of a series of experiments showed that a large majority of our coincidences were not random , and came from some external source . But was the source gravitational waves , or were our antennas perhaps picking up other events , such as earthquakes , electromagnetic waves , or cosmic rays occurring over even the 600-mile distance ? We had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in fact detecting gravitational waves . Earthquake waves were easily eliminated . It would take minutes for a seismic ( earth ) wave to travel the 600 miles from one detector to the other . The time delay would be too long to generate a coincident signal from the detectors . Nonetheless , we built seismic instruments to measure the Earth 's surface motion in all directions . We found that the seismic movements did not coincide with events picked up by our detector . Electromagnetic disturbances are @# @# the most difficult to rule out . T travel at the same speed as grad tional waves ( the speed of fig , Electromagnetic signals can leak i the detector system through im fectly shielded cables , or through t electronic amplifiers . They could e. penetrate the iron vacuum chamber and generate enough magnetic fo. to excite the cylinders inside . To eliminate this possibility . special electromagnetic receiver ' N hooked up to operate through el tronic instrumentation similar to t of the gravitational wave detect Again , there was no correlation tween the receiver 's signals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurious sponses from cosmic rays ? also had be considered . Cosmic rays are hi g speed particles whose electric char could excite the electronic equipme Or they might penetrate the det ? tor cylinder and transfer their i mentum to it , causing a vibrati indistinguishable from gravitatio radiation . We knew that cosmic-r showers had never been detected o ' a base line of 600 miles . Neverthele we had to check out this possibilit Cosmic-ray counters were placed a gravitational detector location my colleagues Prof. N. S. Wall , Pr ( Gaurang B. Yodh , Dr. David Ezro Again , no significant correlation w found between the signals picked by the cosmic-ray detectors and t coincident pulses our antennas we picking up . It was strong eviden that our pair of detectors was doi its job and actually detecting gra itational waves . The next step was to locate t source of the gravitational waves . large aluminum cylinders , like antennas , are directional ? they a more sensitive to incoming wavefron parallel to their long axis than perpendicular to that axis . The cylinder 's long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were t source of the gravitational waves , t detected pulses would intensify eve 12 hours , at noon and midnight . ( The Earth is nearly transparent gravitational waves ) . But no such i crease was found . There were two peaks in intensity correlated with the sidereal day . Si real time is measured by the Earth ' rotation in relation to the stars . Sin the Earth orbits around the sun on a year , it makes on more rotation t year relative to the stars than to t sun . Thus , a sidereal day is th minutes 56 seconds shorter than solar day . This meant that the gravi-@#  | tational waves were peaking whenever the antennas pointed to a source fixed relative to the stars . Clearly , the waves were originating outside of our solar system . Where was this source ? At the center of our galaxy , in Sagit-tarius ! From our galactic center , our measurements suggested , gravitational energy is being radiated away at a furious rate ? 10,000 times faster than that amount radiated in electromagnetic form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year , perhaps more . I published this estimate of energy loss expecting a storm of criticism . But Prof. Charles W. Misner suggests that this tremendous loss of mass ( energy ) by our galaxy may be more apparent than real . He notes that at our galactic center there may be a " black hole " ? an ultra-dense remnant of collapsing matter . Our own galaxy is a spiral type with most of the matter in a plane . Gravitational radiation may be emitted by objects in orbits lying in this plane . Such radiation is directed along the galactic plane where our own planet lies . The directive waves would seem to us to be much more intense than if equally emitted in all directions . To investigate the nature of this gravitational radiation , Darrell , Gretz , and I developed a different detector . This one was a 11/2-ton disk of solid aluminum , seven feet wide and six inches thick . Einstein had predicted that the waves would be of a type called tensor , which would produce , in a disk-shaped detector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right angles to it . Other theorists believe the radiation is a combination of forces ? tensor and scalar . A scalar wave would produce stretch in all directions . So far , our experiments with the disk ? not conclusive ? are consistent with Einstein 's tensor picture . Future detectors of gravitational waves will be made more sensitive by cooling them to near absolute zero . Cooling will reduce the excitation of the atoms in the aluminum antenna . The random motion of these atoms is presently responsible for much of the background " noise " that masks the gravitational pulses . At Argonne National Laboratory Dr. John Purcell and I are developing just such a detector . At Stanford University and Louisiana State , Profs . William Fairbank and William Hamilton are also developing a supercooled detector . Their 6,000-pound aluminum antenna bar will be enclosed in a cryogenic chamber ( a kind of giant Thermos bottle ) where temperature will be maintained near absolute zero , - 273 degrees C. A special superconducting accelerometer will measure the bar 's motion . Nearly all of the Earth 's vibrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a magnetic field . Thanks to the magnetic suspension , the bar will have no direct physical contact with its mounting cradle . Electromagnetic interference will be virtually eliminated by surrounding the detector bar with a thin superconducting shield . ( " At very low temperatures some metals become superconductors ; they carry electricity without absorbing any energy . ) This new generation of detectors will be insensitive to practically everything but what we are looking for ? gravitational waves . The hope is that they will give new insights into the role of gravitation in other galaxies , and eventually into the whole picture of energy in the universe . rE @#
