txt Last October , Chad Dreier got a letter from Great Western Savings &; Loan Association , which holds the $80,000 mortgage on his house . The message : His $658 monthly payment was being increased by $12 . Now it looks as if he will be getting another notice in April . which could mean a further $15-a-month increase . Mr. Dreier , a 31-year-old mortgage banker , greets these increases with equanimity . When he bought his house in 1977 he was unable to obtain a conventional mortgage . But he was offered a variable-rate mortgage , or VRM , on which the interest rate is n't fixed but moves up or down on the basis of an index reflecting the lender 's costs . So when Mr. Dreier faced his first monthly-payment increase , " it did n't particularly bother me , " he says . " I personally feel the variable-rate mortgage is more equitable than the traditional fixed-rate mortgage . " Most of the 250,000 other Californians who hold about $15 billion in VRMs , appear to be equally as tolerant . Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers with VRMs called in to complain about the October rate increase . Other lenders say complaints ranged from " near zero " to " infinitesimal . " Going Federal Since California state-chartered savings and loans began offering VRMs in 1975 , the mortgages appear to have become an established success , despite warnings from consumer groups that the mortgages favor lenders more than borrowers . They are now offered by the 20 largest state-chartered associations in California , and 20 other states have approved their use . They are likely to become even more widespread because the Federal Home than Bank Board has authorized federally chartered savings and loans in California to begin offering variable-rate mortgages . It 's expected that in time the board will authorize federal savings and loans in other states to issue the mortgages in an effort to keep home-loan money flowing . The bank board 's economists wculd like to see more VRMs offered because they believe they can have a " phenomenal " effect on the availability of home loans . They reason that as the rates on VRMs rise , savings and loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high-cost savings deposits , such as the six-month money-market certificates that were introduced in mid-1978 . These additional deposits could , in turn , generate more loans for home buyers and thus could be an important factor in minimizing the effect of any credit crunch in coming months , the economists say . The British Experience Kenneth Biederman , the bank board 's chief economist . says a board study has concluded that an additional $11 billion in mortgage money could have been made available during the 1973 to 1974 credit crunch , when an estimated $13 billion in home-loan demand was n't met . This could have been done , the study says , by increasing savings deposits through the offering of high-interest savings certificates in large denominations and by lending this money to home buyers in the form of VRMs . The idea of mortgages with sliding rates is hardly new . British lenders , called building societies , have-offered only VRMs since 1932 . The rates fluctuate , sometimes sharply , depending on loan demand and on what a council of lenders considers the market can bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the variable rate dropped to 8,4% from 12% in an effort to stimulate loan demand . Also , mortgage-issuing concerns in Carlada , which are trust and insurance companies , mainly offer a type of variable-rate mortgage called a rollover , in which the mortgage is recalculated every five years . In California . VRMs have mainly had the effect of increasing the profits of the statechartered associations that offer them . But so far the mortgages appear to have been little more than a modest help in making money available for home loans . " Exaggerated " Claims This fact has added fuel to the argument of critics of VRMs . John Brown , a lawyer with Ralph Nader 's Public Interest Resear &; Group , insists the claims that VRMs generate new mortgage money are " wildly exaggerated . " Sen. William Proxmire. the Wisconsin Democrat , who is one of the many critics of VRMs in Congress , insists that the mortgages " pit the consumer against the lender in a match to see who can better predict future interest-rate trends . Obviously , the lender , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VRM.s , he says , shift the risk of rising interest rates from the lender " to the person least able to bear it , the homeowner-borrower . " Other critics charge that savings and loans are able to manipulate mortgages to increase their profits . When interest rates are high , fixed-rate mortgages are encouraged ; but when interest rates are going down , VRMs are offered , they say . These critics may have a point . Now that , mortgage rates have soared to near-record levels in California , some state-chartered associations that were pushing VItbfs In 1976 and 1977 , when interest rates were much lower , have started stressing fixed-rate mortgages again . But those home buyers who obtained a VRM when rates were low wo n't find spectacular fluctuations in their payments . The reason is the limitations imposed on mortgage interest rates through a formula used by the California-chartered associations . The interest rate ca n't rise by more than a total of 2.5 percentage points over the life of the mortgage , and it can be adjusted by only a quarter of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased monthly payment , the borrower is given the option of extending the term of the loan , to a maximum of 40 years , or of renegotiating the mortgage with another lender without being penalized . Reductions in interest rates  --  and no California association has yet lowered its rate ? are mandatory . But increases are at the lender 's option . The rates of interest are tied to the cost-of-funds index , published by the Federal Home Loan Bank in San Francisco twice a year , which is the total interest expense of all California savings and loans divided by the average amount of funds outstanding over the six-month period . An association is allowed to raise its rate on VRMs when the index rises by 0.1% above the level in effect at the time a loan was obtained . ' The bank board 's regulations allow federally chartered associations to adjust rates on their VRMs only once a year and by a maximum of half a percentage point . Customers seeking a mortgage will have to be offered the choice of a VRM or a conventional loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempt borrowers to take the VRMs , more associations probably will have to offer inducements such as a discount from the fixed rate of the conventional loan . Most banks and savings and loans in California have n't been offering discounts on VRMs because of the heavy mortgage demand . But those that have offered discounts have been going as high as a quarter of a point . If Chad Dreier the home buyer who opened this story , had been offered a quarterpoint discount on his VRM , he would have saved about S15 a month . But VRM discounts were n't available , and Mr. Dreier found that associations were offering only VRMs on loans over $75,000 . This has clearly been good for the savings and loans ' business The October rate increase added S5 million to Great Western Savings ' pretax earnings on an annual basis . The federally chartered associations in California . which up to now have n't been able to offer the VRMs. have felt the competitive pressure . When state-chartered associations " can jump interest rates a quarter-point and we have to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidding for money , " says Robert Dockson , president of California Federal Savings &; Loan , the nation 's largest federally chartered association . Recently California Federal tried to raise its fixed rate on home loans to 1170 but had to back down , partly because the statechartered associations , cushioned by their VRM profits , did n't follow suit . There is disagreement among savings and loan executives over how much money VRMs make available for home loans . Mr. Dockson of California Federal says the amount of new mortgage money is in the billions of dollars . But S. Mark Taper , chairman of First Charter Financial Corp. , a holding company for American Savings &; Loan Association , says . " I do n't think the VRMs have affected the amount of lending that much . " Also , VRM loans can pose some headaches for the lenders . A key way that savings and loans obtain money for new mortgages is by selling home loans from their portfolios . But VRMs are difficult to resell in the secondary mortgage market . Even so , the VRM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California mortgage scene , and borrowers already seem to have accepted rising interest rates as a fact of life . One reason for the calm acceptance of the first rate increase of between 0.20 and 0.22 of a percentage point last October was the careful explanation by the slightly nervous lenders . For example , Home Savings &; Loan Association , a unit of H.F. Ahmanson Co .. sent out six letters to each of its VRM customers before making its increase . Nor is the matter-of-fact reaction peculiar to California . The Worcester County Institution for Savings in Worcester , Mass. , has been issuing only VRMs since September , 1975 . The savings bank 's 2,100 VRM holders were notified recently of a quarterpoint jump in their Interest rate , the third increase in 18 months . But only 20 homeowners called for an explanation and none complained , says Carl , a bank vice president . The reason might be , he says . that there were two decreases before the recent three increases . and the VRM holders were given a halfpoint discount from the conventional-loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be faced with a steady diet of increases . During 1976 and 1977 the index that measures the lenders ' cost of funds tended to rise slowly because it was influenced by the associations ' large proportion of passbook accounts , paying a fixed , low rate of interest . Although these accounts kept the associations ' expenses down , they also limited- the funds that the associations had to lend to home buyers . So early last year they were given permission to offer high-yielding , six-month certificates of deposit with the rate set at a quarterpoint above the average rate for Treasury bills . These certificates of deposit which are costing the associations about 10% a year . represent an increasing proportion of savings deposits in California associations . As a result , the index compiled by the San Francisco bank board district probably will increase a full half-point this year , and perhaps go up again in April , 1980 , says Alan Bortel , a security analyst with Loeb Rhoades , Hornblower &; Co . This means that home buyer Mr. Dreier could see his monthly mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . Most VRM holders , though , are n't paying the increased amount but are extending the terms of their loans , which the associations must allow . Their reasoning is that they will sell their homes well before their loans mature . Home Savings &; Loan reports that 6070 of its customers are choosing to extend their loans . And Gibraltar Savings &; Loan Association says that 72% of its customers are doing so .
