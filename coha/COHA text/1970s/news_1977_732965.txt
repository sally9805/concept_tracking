txt LOS ANGELES  --  Insurance Investigators believe that as much as $5 million in fraudulent insurance claims has been collected by Middle Eastern students in this country since Ian and funneled to the Palestine Liberation Organization . The California Highway Patrol said last week that it has uncovered a group of foreign students who have systematically bilked more than a dozen insurance companies out of millions of dollars with multiple phony claims for auto thefts and accidents , disability payments for faked injuries in rigged accidents , phony burglaries , and arson . According to reliable sources , at least two members of the group have admitted that money from the frauds , after expenses , has been sent to the PLO and other Arab groups in the Middle East . ONE INSURANCE investigator  --  who asked to remain anonymous out of concern over reprisals by Arab groups ? . said he has interrogated a number of participants in the scheme . " There 's no question about it , that it is political , " he said . " These people essentially are just front people for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise money to support their soldiers in the Middle East . " They 've learned the vulnerabilities of our insurance companies , and they exploit them to the point where it has been paying off like a slot machine . " One man told me that they were simply opposed to our system . They say there 's nothing wrong in what they do because it thwarts our system , and they are justified in doing it . " IN SOME cases , investigators said . members of the ring bought new Chevrolets , reported them stolen , collected the insurance , and then sold them in the Middle East for six times their purchase price . In California alone more than 60 persons who are in America en student visas from Lebanon , Syria , Iraq , Jordan , and Iran have been identified as participants in the frauds . The investigators say they expect the number to run into the hundreds by the time the investigation is complete . Only one person , Parek Al Othman , a Lebanese student who attends Sacramento State College , has been arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Investigators are checking back records to follow the money collected in the scheme , but have not corroborated independently the informants ' stories that the money was being sent to the PLO and other Arab groups . " WE KNOW SOME of the money is // Arabs bilk U. S. firms to aid PLO // being sent out of the country , " said Lt. Glenn Sewell , who is supervising the inquiry for the California Highway Patrol , but he declined to elaborate , saying the identity of the recipients of the money is still under investigation . The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into the international implications of the frauds , and local authorities said they have asked for assistance from the State Department . Because of the lack of effective monitoring and policing of claims on a national basis , no one yet has an accurate estimate of how much money has been lost . " I 'd estimate it 's going to top $5 million , at least , " said James , director of security for the Farmers Insurance Group , who heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation in Minnesota , for example , in Minneapolis-St . Paul , where they took eight different insurance policies on a number of nonexistent autos and reported thorn stolen . My company alone had a ' loss of $15,000 ; the total for all of the companies was over $240,000 . " Sewell . the Highway Patrol investigator , said , " It 's the biggest insurance fraud the highway patrol has ever dealt with . "
