txt A pleased PLO welcomes the Iran upheaval ( below ) . But Israel sees the same events from an exactly opposite perspective , and even Iraq is watching them anxiously ; in Iran itself the new government already is in grave trouble ( stories , Page 6 ) . The turmoil in Iran is welcomed in at least one Arab quarter : the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) . The threat to Shah Muhammad Reza Pahlavi is a boon to key PLO policy goals : setting back United States strategy in the Middle East and countering any inter-Arab pressure on the Palestinians . PLO chief Yasser Arafat , a few months ago leery of public comment on the Iranian upheaval , suddenly is going public . This year , he confidently told a Jan. 7 guerrilla crowd , would be one of " fire and brimstone . " The situation in Iran , Mr. Arafat said , would allow the PLO to turn the tables on US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski 's 1977 " goodbye to the PLO .

Sven Simon PLO 's Arafat : bye-bye ' to US in Iran In the chaos of Iran , that remains to be seen . But , undeniably , the forest fire of violence threatening the Shah 's Peacock Throne has fueled a revival of PLO influence in the region . Egypt 's 14-month-old peace initiative ? and President Carter 's September , 1978 , Camp David summit ? seemed to the PLO a full-scale campaign for a Middle East peace excluding the mainstream Palestinian guerrilla organization . More than a few Palestinian officials believed it was only a matter of time before powerful Arab moderates , such as Saudi Arabia , fell in with the US-sponsored peace initiative . But the blowup in Iran , while threatening US strategy in the Middle East , also has struck fear into Arab neighbors from Saudi Arabia to // From page 1 Iran 's crisis : trump card for PLO more radical states such as Iraq . Virtually all major Arab states fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ? in the Gulf ? from Palestinian and other immigrant workers , Iran 's upheaval , with its mix of political , cultural , and religious ingredients , is hardly a comfort . To the extent that the Shah 's fall becomes likely , the Iranian opposition undoubtedly will find some sudden sunny-day friends . But for the time being , the jittery Arab world has reacted either with support for the Shah ( Saudi Arabia ) or a careful silence . The PLO , without the worries of statehood , now has fallen solidly behind the rebels and their exiled Muslim religious leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini . ? Ayatollah reciprocates Ayatollah Khomeini has glowingly reciprocated . The PLO , in fact , is about the only party to escape the wrath of the ayatollah in a recent interview with the Beirut magazine , Monday Morning . The ayatollah opens fire on Washington , Moscow , Peking , Egypt , Israel and the Iraqis , who expelled him from earlier exile in Baghdad last year .

It is no secret that the PLO never has liked the Shah , seen throughout most of the Arab world as an American puppet . Arab diplomats have long been reporting that Palestinian guerrillas have provided arms and training for the Iranian rebels ? despite official PLO denials . But PLO dependence on Saudi Arabia and other Arab states for money and other support has made guerrilla officials think twice before going public with their backing for the rebels . That the PLO now feels confident enough to support the anti-Shah forces openly is an index of the depth of Arab fear inspired by the Iranian unrest . The PLO , which in the past has deflected inter-Arab pressure and enmity by playing one state against another , has found in Iran a " card " that carries weight with all the Arabs and with the West as well . As one Arab diplomat puts it , " They the PLO are in effect saying : ' look , your diplomatic equations were n't accounting for the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American backing and modern arms of the Shah . Do n't forget the Palestinians can do the same . ' "
