globe  --  including our fifty states which 011ie has visited with the President to record it for now and for posterity ? 011ie must be ready . He emphasizes that President Nixon is an extraordinarily well-organized man and that crises and sudden command decisions at odd hours are few and far between . But they are possible . And when the command comes , 011ie responds . In the White House , he may hover unobtrusively in the background during an informal conference . If the target is 5,000 miles away , he travels with the President in the number one plane , Spirit of ' 76 . How did 011ie Atkins reach such an enviable position ? He tells it modestly . A native of Wellesley , Massachusetts , he took to newspaper work as a kid , but in due time the camera became his love and the move to the White House began from afar . He was the youngest photographer on the staff of The Saturday Evening Post in the halcyon days when Ben Hibbs was its editor and Norman Rockwell was dashing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post . Rockwell used a lot of photographs in his work , as research in the capture of a fleeting expression or the turn of a bit of costume finery , and 011ie at times worked along with him . He fell under the spell of Rockwell 's gentle genius , then and now , and loves to tell of their trip around the world together : " He was so kind . In every land we visited people knew all about him and recognized him . A mother in Cairo brought around her little boy , and Norman took the time to make him a tiny drawing . Rockwell had perfected a little sketch of a dog he President Nixon and Dr. Henry Kissinger walk down a street in the Kremlin with the President 's residence in the background . // could do in fifteen seconds . Each was a whimsical little masterpiece of an original but he scattered them around the world as if they were mere calling cards . I even asked him for one once . I 'll draw you something better than that ! ' was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . So today I do n't even have a dog , and I wish I did . " * It was as a Post photographer that 011ie first met Richard Nixon , working on several articles together . And then he became Nixon 's staff photographer during the campaign for the presidency . One can only guess at the stamina , the tact , the alertness , and the loyalty which must go with such a job . And , of course , now  --  with his man in the White House  --  Atkins must demonstrate all of these qualities manifold . 011ie tells about his job : " I am not a nagger . I 'm not underfoot everywhere we go . I have the opportunity to be present at all times , but I try to make the most of it as unobtrusively as possible . When I want something special I may send a request through , via the staff , Continued on page 130 *When Norman Rockwell was advised of this by the editors of the Post , just at the time of this writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 011ie , after all the years , to reaffirm their friendship . It is reproduced with this article , after which it will be presented to 011ie Atkins as a surprise gift . 4 ? continued from page 111 trol over his companies grew more and more remote , while his buddies were planning , at the first hint of trouble , to bring in outsiders to take over , Bernie turned out to be something of a planner himself . And that 's why today , when he has lost all control of , indeed all contact with , his empire , he can afford to live like an emperor . That 's one way of telling the story . The other way , the hard fact way , is this : a couple of years ago the stock market all over the world began to dip . The earnings of Bernie 's companies were affected , of course , but more by massive investment in plans for future profit . Expenses went up as they did with every company , as they did in every household . The price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , began to drop to a more reasonable level . A company run by executives detached enough to make cool , long-range judgments could have ridden out the turbulence . But Bernie , the incurable social worker , had with the best of intentions built a company of such unlikely ingredients as kindness and sharing . Unlike the heads of many other personally created companies , who take most of the winnings for themselves and leave comparative peanuts for those under them , all Bernie 's executives owned healthy chunks of the company , had become rich with its rise . " When they had nothing , " Bernie sighed , " they were risk-takers , fighters . As soon as they had a lot , they panicked at the first threat . They called in outsiders to save them . The outsiders raped them . " When the battle for control of I.O.S. was raging , and when headlines in the financial press carried news of defeat after defeat for Bernie at the hands of cabals of old pals , I asked him who , in the end , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And said , " 1 will . " That was more than a year ago Recently ( and Bernie 's prophecy may come true before this reaches print ) the outsiders who took over from his pals  --  having pruned from the parent I.O.S. tree all its fruitful , storm-untouched branches  --  have offered to sell Bernie the battered , but still indomitably living , 1 . O.S. It would be simpler and infinitely less troublesome for Bernie to create a brand-new company , but his affection for I.O.S. is comparable to a mother 's for an unruly , unpromising child  --  who is confident she can nurse it back to normalcy , even though she might have a far easier time starting afresh with a brand-new baby . Can he do it ? " I did do it , " he said . " Then they tried and they could n't . Yes ... I think 1 can do it again . " 1S for the President to decide whether or not he might be available for a shot or two I think might be especially effective . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ling gun . In a couple of seconds I can get ten to fifteen shots which cover everything that took place in those few splinters of action or barely registered facial expressions . " 011ie became a specialist on the Washington beat before he was assigned to President Nixon . " I photographed them all since FDR . It was hard going with Roosevelt . Everything was done in those early war years to conceal his infirmity . Today the public would know all about such a thing . But then it was not generally realized that he had to be virtually carried everywhere he went . And when we photographers finally got a chance to shoot him , it was all stage set in advance . He would be propped up in his chair at his desk , and it often looked as though his back were propped up as well . With another subject , it would have been a disaster . But FDR had that great smile and a fine head and somehow or other the pictures came off . But we had to work fast . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Truman was another story . He was full of vitality , and he loved photographers . . . ' because they ca n't write anything bad about me . ' The problem with Truman was his glasses . They had such magnification that if you were n't careful his eyeballs might come out looking like saucers . We tried hard not to do that " Ike Eisenhower was the perfect subject for a photographer , with his so-called ' rubber face . ' He had such a variety of expressions chasing each other across his face that one time I made an entire magazine layout consisting entirely of the different facial expressions I had caught during one press conference . " John F. Kennedy , of course , was easy to photograph . Ike had run the White House very much as a general would , with everything scheduled and ordered , and in many ways Nixon was to take his cue from Eisenhower in this . But Kennedy was very informal and impromptu . Just the same , though , everything he did served a purpose . That applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very informal , but if you ever made a picture he did n't like , you heard about it afterwards . " LBJ was another man again . And all men are different , just as all presidents are men . He was a Texas cowboy in looks and manners . He could get sore when a ceremony went wrong and dress down everyone in sight , right out in the open . And pull open his shirt to show his surgical scar . Well , let me say that President Nixon would n't do that . " The President is very serious about his job . He does n't worry about the photography side of it , or have a special profile angle which he favors over any others as one president did . He is distinctive among all of the presidents I have photographed in that he sees no point in trying to make him appear what he is not . He is a businessman type , orderly and perfectly self-disciplined . He Continued on page 137 continued from page 81 those years . The story of the discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person than Dr. Malouf Abraham , Jr. , of Canadian , Texas , its owner , who has so graciously permitted the painting to be reproduced in these pages - its first publication after all these years ! Something about a Rockwellian experience seems to loosen the restraints of normal reportage . Here is Dr. Abraham 's own version of how he acquired his painting , demonstrating an ebullience equal to Dean Krakel 's : " Crazy , wonderful things are always happening to me . For instance , the day I bought the Rockwell painting started as an ordinary sort of day . There I was , a young doctor from a little Texas town , walking down the sidewalks of New York , gawking at all the sights of the big city . Buying anything over five dollars was the farthest thing from my mind , 1 assure you . " In my exploring I just happened to go into a Lexington Avenue gallery and in visiting with the owner he mentioned that a Rockwell painting had just been acquired the day before . It had been in the attic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would 1 like to see it ? Good grief , yes ! ( This is where the ordinary day I was talking about became anything but ordinary ! ) " There it was  --  Norman Rockwell 's First Day of School  --  covered with the grime and dust of fifty years in the attic . I immediately felt the ' desire to possess it . ' I took a wet towel and wiped some of the dirt off so I could tell more about the true colors . Brilliant colors ! Fantastic emotion in each face ! I was enchanted ! I had to have this painting ! My intuition was absolutely yelling at me  --  saying , ' Buy it ! Do n't call your wife . Do n't call the bank . Do n't sleep on it  --  just buy it right now ! ' " Some people might say the devil made me do it . I like to say it was ' my intuition ' ? the same intuition that helped me choose a lot of other things that I love dearly , such as Medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . Strange and wonderful , too , that one touch of Rockwell makes the whole world kin . How enviable to see for the first time an original Rockwell painting neven before shown  --  almost as enviable as seeing for the umpteenth time an original Rockwell painting which improves upon every viewing . For such is the way of true genius -- a light in our dark , glowing ever brighter and brighter . 2 in all their dangers . He has been able to convey to the reader the warmth and humor , the dedication , the dynamic , and the Christlikeness of Dr. Bell without failing to show his tremendous self-discipline and uncompromising loyalty to the Bible and the person of Jesus Christ . As our Lord did centuries ago , Dr. Bell combined the healing ministry to the bodies of the sick with the ageless message of the redeeming power of the Gospel . John Pollock devotes the larger part of his book to the China years . I am glad of this , quite apart from the fascination of the story . For in this period lie the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of a Christian character and a Christian family is of lasting and universal significance . When circumstances forced him out of China in 1941 , Dr. Bell returned to America to find his de-nomination in a state of theological division and confusion . During a busy surgical practice he founded the Presbyterian Journal . He helped found and eventually became executive editor of Christianity Today which has influenced more clergymen in the last decade than any other publication . His writings are read not only by clergy but by Christians throughout the world . He has been a much-sought-after speaker on medical , social , political , and religious issues for years . He was nominated twice to he moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church , U.S. , and on two occasions he was elected moderator of the Asheville Presbytery . The story of Dr. Nelson Bell is one of the most exciting and thrilling narratives of our generation . My heart certainly missed a beat at the piece about my future wife and the hand grenade ! I am convinced that this book has great relevance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commend it , but urge that Christians everywhere read it and profit by it . This book goes out with my prayers that it will be a blessing and benediction to this entire generation of Christians throughout the world-as the life lived has been a blessing and benediction to me in my ministry . ncontinued from page 130 never tries to be the old-shoe type . He knows exactly what he wants done , by all means , but if things go wrong he does n't get upset . He accepts it as it is , and if he has any criticism to make , he 'll give it later , in privacy . He 's a ' clean desk ' man . And personally he 's the same  --  always neat , clean , and dressed for the job he 's in . He can relax when he wants to , but most of the time he 's ready to work . He has distinctive features and a strong character . He is the best of all the presidents I have known as a subject for photography . " 011ie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not merely recruited from the civil service or military ranks . He is a photo-journalist , and that is what Ben Hibbs hired him as , not just a cameraman . When Nixon retires , so will 011ie , at least from official duties , although he probably will continue a private career in his craft . He and his wife Marjorie have two married daughters , and they all find it hard to keep track of him these days  --  Virginia today and Moscow tomorrow . But he takes it all in stride . His photographs tell a story of himself  --  self-effacing , but on target for the moment of truth , be it history , or a candid off-the-record shot . A meeting to shake the world , or merely to touch on but two hearts . Strangely enough , the camera of 011ie Atkins faces both ways , the lens out front telling the story , and the way it is told revealing the man behind it all . n                 @ @ @ @
