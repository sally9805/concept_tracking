The question had just been asked : Did he predict failure for the Jerusalem talks ? As Jordan 's King Hussein was about to answer , a door to his office in Amman 's Basman Palace flew open and Abdul Hamid Sharaf , Chief of the Royal Court , burst in with a message . Scanning the note that had been handed to him , the King turned to his interviewer , TIME Cairo Bureau Chief Wilton Wynn . " I suppose , " said Hussein with a grim smile , " we should be speaking in the past tense . " The King read the dispatch aloud : President Anwar Sadat had withdrawn his delegation from Jerusalem and summoned the Egyptian parliament into special session . <P> Even before that unexpected news , Hussein 's mood had been dour as he discussed the problems of Middle East peacemaking with Wynn . " If these talks fail , " the King predicted , " we are then at the end of the road , the end of Resolution 242 , the end of Resolution 338 the broad United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for peace . We will be heading for disaster in terms of this area and the whole world . " <P> Hussein praised Sadat 's initiative in going to Jerusalem as " courageous , and representing the longings within the souls of so many in the Arab world , a step forward to bring things to a head . " But , he added , " so far , we have no confidence that Sadat will be met by a similar response from Israel . Frankly , after all these years of trying hard to see any glimmer of hope , I am not optimistic at all . " <P> Although Egypt 's President has lately become the Arab world 's principal peace negotiator , no leader in the past decade has tried harder than Hussein to reach an agreement with Israel . The King looks back on his efforts as failures : " Ever since 1967 , we have made it clear-before the 1973 war-that if Israel were willing to withdraw from territory occupied in 1967 , we would be ready to negotiate or do anything to achieve that end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed even in getting a disengagement with Israel in the Jordan Valley . " <P> Would Hussein nevertheless still participate with Sadat in talks with Israel ? " If we could see light at the end of the tunnel , we would not hesitate one second to negotiate . But we need a set of principles to provide that light . " What sort of principles ? " Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories , with minor rectifications on a reciprocal basis on the West Bank since borders there are cease-fire lines rather than logical boundaries , Arab sovereignty over East Jerusalem , the right of return or compensation for Palestinian refugees , and the placing of West Bank and Gaza occupied territory under international auspices until the inhabitants could exercise self-determination .
