Phaedra , wife of Theseus , spurned and disgraced , twists and writhes in an agony of incestuous love for her stepson Hippolytus . Loosening a white silk sash at her waist , she knots it around her throat , pulls it tight , then falls to the ground in a lifeless swoon , her hair spilling in an orange cloud over her crimson robes . On a balcony overhead , a chorus splits the air with a rising lament-a sort of aural locust swarm-followed by a series of immense , loud gong-tones . <P> There are a few inappropriate giggles at Manhattan 's Lincoln Center , but no matter . The important thing is that French Composer Maurice Ghana 's jagged , surrealistic chamber opera , Syllabaire pour Phdre ( 1967 ) , has found a stage . Together with Henry Purcell 's well-known yet seldom performed 17th century opera Dido and Aeneas , Ghana 's work last week inaugurated the Metropolitan Opera 's Mini-Met-officially known as the Opera at the Forum . <P> The Mini-Met stage is one that many Girl Scout theater troupes might find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln Center complex , the Forum is a tiny arena theater seating 280 . There is no proscenium and no orchestra pit ; the musicians , instrumentalists as well as chorus , must squeeze onto a narrow balcony suspended above the stage . <P> Despite the physical disadvantages , the company has assembled a trio of tightly meshed , highly polished productions . Mini-Met amply fulfills hopes that have been growing for nearly two decades . Early in his administration as the Met 's general manager , Sir Rudolf Bing spoke of creating a second opera stage for intimate performances of small-scale works unsuited to a 3,800-seat house , with the dual purpose of providing young artists with wider exposure while attracting audiences not smitten with standard repertory . But lacking a convenient junior theater like Milan 's 600-seat Piccolo Scala or Munich 's 500-seat Cuvillies Theater , and with no money to build one , the plan lay gathering dust until last spring , when Bing 's successor , Gran Gentele , took it up . Gentele 's plan to use the Juilliard School Opera Theater fell through , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to curtail its season , offered the Forum . <P> After Gentele 's death last July , it fell to Acting General Manager Schuyler Chapin and his aides to map out final details . The resulting three-week season of 25 performances features the Ohana-Purcell double bill , conducted by Richard Dufallo and staged by Paul Emile-Deiber , alternating with a rollicking treatment of Virgil Thomson 's Four Saints in Three Acts , conducted by Roland Gagnon and superbly staged by Alvin Ailey . By sprinkling a few gilded names among the less familiar artists who will get exposure at Mini-Met , Chapin clearly hopes to attract subscribers from the parent company as well as tap a new and younger public . On opening night , for example , a gifted newcomer named Nancy Williams sang Phaedra , while Dido and Aeneas were handsomely dispatched by International Stars Evelyn Lear and Thomas Stewart . The audience reflected the casting : brocaded ladies and black-tie escorts presumably for Lear and Stewart , denim and leather for Williams .                @ @ @ @ @
