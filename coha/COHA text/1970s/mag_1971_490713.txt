THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ON Monday , February 22nd , at Harvard 's Sanders Theatre , Tom Wicker , of the New York Tims , taking part in a teach-in against the war in Indo-China , made an extemporaneous speech that we believe to be of unusual importance . We quote from it here at length : " This old war , from beginning to end , has been rooted and grounded in misapprehension . I recall being in Vietnam in early 1966 with Hubert Humphrey , who was then Vice-President . At the conclusion of that trip , we were taken around to the Ambassador 's house . The Ambassador was then Henry Cabot Lodge  --  I 'm sure most of you remember Henry Cabot Lodge . And Mr. Lodge sat at one side of the portico there , and the Vice-President of the United States sat at the other side , and they lined up the television cameras back here , and in between they sat six hapless , helpless American advisers to local district officials , and they said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them how it was going . It was going pretty good . And I was a rookie at that game and was taking notes pretty madly there , and a friend of mine who had spent about two years in Vietnam came up to me and said , ' This sounds good , does n't it You ought to have heard what that fellow told me the other night when I was talking with him in his tent . What he said did not go anywhere near what he said on the television cameras . ' " So I think that , in many ways , is the story of this war . We 've been fooling ourselves . We 've been fooling ourselves time and time again . I would take issue to some extent with some of the things that have been said here tonight , because the impression , I think , has been left that evil politicians and evil administrators have fooled the American people into doing something that they did not want to do . I would not for one moment want to imply , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . We were being fooled with talk about counter-insurgency hack in 1961 . What were we going to do in the jungle ? President Kennedy was reading the handbook of the Irish Republican Army , and that 's not a joke . And the White House press group at the time went down to Fort Bragg with President Kennedy , and we saw the Blur Berets at practice , or the Green Berets  --  well , one of those Berets  --  and they even had one of those ridiculous things where a fellow with something like a rocket on his back went up and over and down on the other side of a creek . He then was free to attack the enemy . They were more vulnerable than our helicopters in the Panhandle . While this show was going on , a reporter from Agence FrancePresse came over to me and whispered in my car and said  --  he had been in Indo-China as far hack as 1951 ? All this looks great . But none of it worked when we tried it in 1951 . ' And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We fooled ourselves with the bombing campaign . I remember when the planes went north from Danang and Pleiku . We all heard glorious stories of how we were going to pulverize them up there and within eighteen months they were going to conic to the conference table and bring peace . There was one story in the New York Times that deserves honor  --  at least one on that occasion . It was written by a man named Charley Mohr , who was then and is now our premier war correspondent  --  it 's getting to he a profession  --  and Charley brought out an important point . He said that the problem at Pleiku ? Those of you who have read the history may remember that that was the place where there were some American airplanes and some American troops before they officially had a combat role , and that base was guarded by a perimeter of South Vietnamese troops . The perimeter was pierced , and the Vietcong came through and destroyed our planes at that base and killed a number of Americans . The next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the North . Charley Mohr pointed out in his article what has been the of this war from the start : that if the South Vietnamese ca n't hold the perimeter against the Vietcong in the South , then you ca n't do anything by bombing the North . But we fooled ourselves at that time into thinking we could do something with bombing in the North . " We fooled ourselves that we were pursuing the lesson of Munich . Ve fooled ourselves that somewhere in Peking , or in Hanoi , perhaps , hut somewhere over there , there was a Hitler and we were holding the line against aggression . We fooled ourselves that a half-million ground troops put in " tk-0 there with all their fir e-power could take care of a few little brown men . " Well , we 've found since then that in the efforts to go in there if there was ever any validity to the effort of going in to try and protect people , if that 's what we thought we were doing ? we found that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy them . And that was fooling ourselves with a vengeance . " We fooled ourselves in the progress we were making . I was at a dinner party in Washington along about that time  --  the fall of 1966 , I believe . A very high Administration official came up to me and assaulted me , verbally , in front of a lot of people that I did n't like to be assaulted brutally in front of . He said to me , ' Why does your paper print lies ? ' And I said , ' Well , I ca n't defend that case . Which lie are you talking about And he said that when ' the Buddhists took Hui : - last month ' or attacked Hui ' last month , ' or whenever it was at that time ? he said , ' You printed a story in your paper that said they captured the radio station and held it for two hours and broadcast antigovernment propaganda . ' And he said , I did n't believe that . ' And he said , ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he said they did n't take that radio station over there to broadcast their propaganda . Now , why do you print lies like that ! ' ' I said , ' Mr. Secretary , there is n't very much I can do about that . I do n't know . ' A few months later , I was in Vietnam , and I went to Hue . and I found the Secretary 's man in Hue , and I found that he was only too eager to tell me : that the Buddhists had indeed taken that radio station and broadcast propaganda . But you did n't expect him to tell that to the Secretary of State in a long-distance-telephone call . " Well , we 've fooled ourselves . The American people are still fooling themselves . We are fooling ourselves on the Vietnamization program . We are told Vietnamization will bring a generation of peace . And not just peace but peace with honor , which is going to prevent the establishment of a Communist government or something less than a non-Communist government in South Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those things . And , furthermore , even to the extent that Vietnamization will remove nor troops from Vietnam , whether or not it brings a generation of peace , whether or not that peace has honor , Vietnamization has required the invasion of two cowl-tries and the bombing of three to evacuate one , and that is a policy that seems to me to have very little future to it and very little profit . " Worst of all , we fooling ourselves that this war is winding down . This war is not winding down . It 's not winding down for six million refugees . It 's not winding down for the people on whom the bombs drop , for the children on whom the napalm drops , for those one million people who arc going to he moved out of the northern provinces into the southern provinces . You know that in ancient times the southern provinces were a different country . They arc moving them into a different country down there . The war is not winding down for those people . It 's not winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the incursion there . It 's not winding down on the Plaint des arses , where we have- dropped more bombs than we did throughout World War II . It 's not even winding down for the Thais , because the- Chinese have resumed building a road through the northern part of Laos up to Thailand . With our incursion into Laos , the Thais are going to become vulnerable . " So this war is not winding down . It 's another case in which we arc fooling ourselves . The American people have been fooling themselves over there for ten long years that their aim is selfless and their cause is just . Yet the truth of the matter is that it has always been a war for American objectives , however dubious and illusory they may he . It has become in recent years a war to conceal original American folly , if not original American sin . It has become a war to preserve American vanity , a war to preserve American self-regard and to preserve American delusions of grandeur . It 's become a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating and I use the word advisedly , and with consciousness of its meanings to many people ? we are creating a holocaust in Indo-China . I went , a year ago , to Auschwitz . But there will never be in Indo-China a glass case full of the eyeglasses of those who have been butchered , and there will never be there a glass case full of little children 's shoes and the hair from women 's beads . There will never be any such glass cases there , because we are incinerating the people without saving the booty . " IVe are fooling ourselves when we think that the war is winding down , and , above all , when we think that through any means whatsoever there can be honor in the end in a war which had no honor in the beginning and has Cyril less in the process . " And , in the great tradition of this war , many of us , and many of us here in this hall tonight , are still fooling ourselves . There are some who are fooling themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done . I would n't want to characterize it as much or little , but something has been done . " We stopped the bombing once ; we suggest that it could he stopped again . " We got negotiations going once , and perhaps we can do it again . " We got one President out , and perhaps we can do that again . " We got one party turned by the hunger of being out of office from a war party to a peace party , and perhaps we can do that again . " But there are many things that we can do . We have done some things , and I say we can do more things . We can work more . Or , in my case , I can perhaps write more . But there are those who would not advocate that course . We can speak more , . although there are those , I 'm sure  --  there arc those in this hall tonight  --  who would n't endorse that proposition . " We can vote when the time conies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things that we can do . " There are others in this hail , however , who are fooling themselves into thinking that we can do it overnight . They are fouling themselves when they say that . The history of this war is not merely a history of misapprehension --  it is a history of the search for a quick fix . Something that would get it over with quit. * invasions of Laos and Cambodia . And , among those who want to end the war out of peaceful motives and who want to restore the character of America , those who think that they can do it with a quick fix are just as wrong , and , in the long run , are going to do just as much damage . This is true because tl:c American people have not simply been duped and misled into a disaster . I think we must face up to the fact  --  and I know many who do face up to the fact  --  that there is something deeply wrong in our country . Something has gone wrong in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam . The war is the sickest fruit of what is wrong in our country  --  it is not the only thing wrong . And until we begin to contemplate what is wrong with our country , then we are not going to be able to do much about the wrong things our country dues . This is what we have got to face up to . I need n't enumerate those many things in our society that need hr dealt with . They all stem from the same basic problems in oar society , which arc the distorted values by which we have sought personal affluence and physical power and military power in the world as against human values and things that improve the human quality of life . " I say , also , that we are all fooling ourselves or will be fooling ourselves if we think that in this effort that lies before us only success matters . I believe that we can stop this war and I believe that we can deal with the problems that face the United States of America . I believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in redemption , and I believe that we can do it . But " Al , you 've been chosen Businessman of the Year by the Junior Chamber of Commerce . " suppose , ladies and gentlemen , suppose we can not . Just in case we ca n't , I will tell you what I think . Suppose we can not redeem our country . I believe with the poet that a man 's reach should exceed his grasp . I believe with William Faulkner that the basest of all things is to be afraid . And I hold with Cavafy : Honor to those who guard their Thermopylae , even if in the end Ephialtes will appear and the Medes will gn through . If we 're going to think that only success matters in the effort to redeem America , then we shall fail he-fore we begin . " Stephen Shore HOTOC.RAPHS BY STEPHEN SHORE , " one of three new exhib-its in the Prints and Drawings galler-ies of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , is the first one-man show at the Met of the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pho-tographer who happens to be a friend of ours . The photographs in the show are of ordinary things , but they invite you to think about ultimate things . There are photographs of cars decaying in some woods near Kingston , New York ; of friends on a ranch in Texas ; of clouds , seen from above and from below ; of the house and grounds of the Institute of General Semantics , in Lime Rock , Connecticut ; of Mr. Shore 's parents , Fred and Ruth Shore . The picture of Mr. Shore 's father is made up of two photographs of the same size side hi side . On the left , his father is wearing a double-breasted blazer and it tic ; on the right , he is wearing an undershirt . The picture of his mother is similar . In one of two photographs she has on a dress ; in the other , a slip . There was no formal opening of the show , so Mr. Shore invited some friends and sonic : relatives , including his parents , to meet him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day the show opened . Mr. Shore is tall and lean , and grave , although he laughs quite a bit . He got interested in pho togtaphy when he was six and was given a darkroom kit , but his interest waned until , at the age of nine , he was given a small camera . Since then he has worked at photography steadily . He is twenty-three now . Mr. Shore spent most of his childhood in Manhattan and does not know how to drive a car . While he was growing up , he attended a number of schools . They included the Little Red School House , on Bleecke r Street ; the Hackle ) School , in Tarrytown , a boarding school with battlements ; and the Columbia Grammar School , on West Ninety-third Street . He was scheduled to enter Bard College but dropped out of high school a month before graduation . He became the photographer for a symphony orchestra , and made friends with And ) Warhol and his friends and took pictures of them Th. , for a ) ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shore used to manufacture ladies ' handbags and is now an investor . Stephen Shore flew to various parts of the country and looked at electronics firms , considering them as investment possibilities . Last fall , he took two courses at the New School  --  one in science and religion , the other in molecular biology . Stephen Shore and his friends arrived at his show in advance of Isis parents . Mr. Shore said that his father had come to see the show that morning and bad spotted his portrait from across the room and had taken it very well . He did n't think his mother knew yet what she was in for . Then his parents arrived . His father was grinning , and his mother did not notice . herself for two minutes . When she did , she was startled and said , with no malice , and with some affection , " I 'm going to kill him . " Everyone laughed , and his father said , " ' We 're the only two living people hanging in a museum . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother laughed , too . " I 'm going to get m ) self copyrighted , " she said . ? OVERHEARD at a publisher 's cocktail party , from the lips of a visiting British author : " I must say , I 've been enjoying your country . Spent the weekend in Connecticut . First time I 've been to the interior . " Telephone Gall WHEN the telephone rang a few days ago , we approached it warily , as we have learned to do of late . We heard a woman 's voice at the other end . " The bookcase is in the kitchen , " the voice said . " Yes ? " we said , assuming a neutral tone . " Who is this ? " the voice asked . " What number am I calling ? " We recited our telephone number . " Oh , my God ! " said the voice . " I thought I was calling my brother . Hi . How are you ? " " Fine , " we said . It was our friend Janet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " Janet said . " A friend of mine is lending me a piano , which I have n't got room for , and there was a bureau that belongs to me in - Wallingford , and a bookcase that was in storage , which I also do n't have room for . The storage company is also a moving company , and it occurred to me that on the way to bring me the bookcase the movers could stop off and pick up the piano at my friend 's house , in the Village , and the bureau , which I managed to get as far as Westport , and deliver everything to my place on the way back . " " Ummh , " we said . " So I called the moving company , which is in the Village , and the operator told me that the phone was either out of order temporarily or out of order forever  --  disconnected , " Janet said . " I had to go down to the Village anyway , to the New School , to register for an Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide between French and Spanish . It was the coldest day of the year . When I found the place , there was a note on the door that said , ' 2:15 ? Back in one hour . ' It was three-fifteen , so I went into a bar , and they sent me. to another moving place , down the block , with half the same name , . I explained my problem to the guy there . ' Ted 's been having trouble with his phone since November , ' he told mc . ' He 's in there , but I know Ted  --  he wo n't come to the door . If you want to get in touch with him , you have to send him a letter or a wire . ' " Wen , I decided to write him a note ? Please call me ' ? and I wrote down my number and stuck the note under the door , " Janet continued . " He called immediately . He must have been standing right on the other side of the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . My daughter took the call , and she told him she did n't know anything about it , which she did n't . He told her that he could see she was n't interested in either her mother 's welfare or his welfare . He said he had to walk a block in the cold to get to a pa phone . When I got home , she said , ' A crazy man called . ' Later , he called again . He said that all his calls were going to the Port Authority Bus Terminal or he was getting all their calls . Something like that . Anyway , he was delighted to hear from me , he said . He had n't had any business for months , because of the phones . While ht. was telling me this , the operator broke in and told him his time was up , so I took the number of the pay phone and called him hack . I told him about the piano in the . Village , and the bureau , which I said I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ht had . He asked me what kind of piano it was , and I said it was a studio upright . He said he 'd probably need one to two men to move the piano , and one man for the rest of the job , since I said there would he somebody at my apartment to help move the stuff in . Then he asked me , When would you like to do it ? ' " ' How about the day after tomorrow ? ' I said . ' Saturday . ' " ' O.K. , ' he said , ' What time ? ' " How about ten in the morning ? ' I said . " ' Ten ! ' he said . ' How about six ? ' " I said , ' Six ! I work during the week , and , besides , I have to make breakfast for my children . ' " ' I can see that working men are different from working women , ' he said . " Look , ' I said . Call MC back later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got furious I 've called you eleven times , and I 'm not going to call you again , ' he said . " So I said , O.K. , how about nine o'clock ? ' " If you 're not there at seven , ' he said , you do n't get the bookcase . ' " I think we both hung up at the same time . " Janet ' paused for a moment , and we pulled a chair up to the telephone . " Well , I got to my friend 's house at nine , and they got there at ten-thirty , " she continued . " None of the people who showed up were movers . At first , there were two of them . One was drunk . Apparently , they make all their phone calls from that bar . They looked at the piano , and immediately they said they needed three men . The third guy got there an hour later , and he was very belligerent . Movers are beasts ! ' he said . Everybody thinks a mover is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I eat a hot lunch . I use a fork and a knife and a napkin . I do n't just eat a sandwich . ' He turned out to be a black actor . " " Ah , " we said . " He looked at the piano , " Janet went on , " and he said , We ca n't move this thing . This is n't a spinet . ' That 's how he said it ? spinet . ' " I did n't say it was a spinet , ' I said . I said it was a studio upright . ' " ' This is not a spinet , ' he kept saying . Finally , he said , ' We need four men for this . ' " Forty-eight years old , " she added . " He told me he was much older than I was . I did n't say anything . He 's separated from his wife and he 's living with a girl , but be also sees his ex-girl , who 's married and has three children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mover Number Four . " When the fourth man showed up , he announced that he was drunk . He was also the owner  --  Ted . I recognized his voice , but he called himself Bill . He did n't want inc to know who he was . They all stood around looking at the piano . One of the helpers said he had moved a piano twenty years ago . " ' I think you have to move the piano into the kitchen before you try to get it down the stairs , ' I said . " Lady , go away , ' the owner said . Just go away and do n't look . ' " Later on , after they shoved it around a hit , he said , I think the lady 's right . ' " Finally , they managed to get the piano wedged in the hallway , half in the apartment and half on the stairs , " Janet went on . We sat back in our chair and lit a cigarette . " By that time , the landlord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " This ledge has to go , ' the movers were saying . This has to go . ' They were ripping off parts of the piano . They suggested ripping off parts of the wall , but the landlord objected . They decided to tie the piano , so the keyboard would n't fall off , but they did n't have a long enough strap , so they said , Let 's tie the bench . ' Eventually , they gave up . It took them three hours not to move the piano . " After that , the least drunk guy drove the truck up to Westport , where my ex-husband had brought the bureau from Wallingford , and he delivered the bookcase to my super , who chopped a huge piece off of it . He explained it would n't fit in the elevator . I figure the bookcase can go in the kitchen , where it is , and the bureau can go in the kids ' room . The piano may have to go in my bathroom , because there is no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining-room table , which is there now , if the neighbors do n't object . Hey , is there anybody you want me to look up in California in case I go there ? I may go to California tonight . " We sat up in our chair abruptly . " I 've got to hang up now , " she said . " I 'm supposed to be giving a dancing lesson to a couple who arc going to Brazil for a wedding . I 'm teaching them the samba , the rumba , and the waltz . Did you know that I used to be a dance instructor at Arthur Murray'si I had my wisdom teeth pulled out in exchange for rumba lessons years ago . The dentist never got further than the box step . " Bye , " Janet said , and hung up . " Goodbye , " we said .
