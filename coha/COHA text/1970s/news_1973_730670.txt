txt Bob Dylan 's popular song " The answer is blowin ' in the wind " must have special meaning these days for officials of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company . But they undoubtedly have little to sing about as they peer out of their Boston headquarters at their nearby new 60-story Hancock Tower ? now speckled with plywood where more than 270 windows have broken out during high winds . After trying everything , they have hired engineers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology to find out why the large panes ( nearly 11 feet tall and 4 feet wide ) break whenever winds from a certain direction gust against the mirrored-glass skyscraper Glass-conscious Bostonians have walked under extended covered walkways beneath the $95 million tower since 75-mile-an-hour winds on Jan. 20 broke 65 panes and nicked or scratched 1,000 others . " We 're looking at all conceivable sources of the problem , " explains consulting engineer Robert J. Hansen , who is designing a series of high-level tests to measure dynamic wind pressures , temperatures , and stress conditions when storms buffet Boston 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 35th floor of the sleek new Boston landmark Dr. Hansen and Frank Durgin , the MIT engineer who does the actual testing , study instruments which tell them the pressure and the amount of motion at any of 31 selected panes on the building 's glass skin . Having laid more than eight miles of cable in the still-unfinished building , Mr. Durgin is " waiting for the weather . " This type of testing , Dr. Hansen concedes , is still " an evolving art . " Mr. Durgin adds : " It 's like a puzzle . You 've got to put all the pieces together ; you ca n't look at any one thing . " A recording device saves the information , measurable 100 times each second , from the 31 electrode-like pressure stations . A computer will reduce and collate the measurements . This week , while engineers move more instruments into the building , they will apply a " load testing device " to some of the double-layered panes . The device , a " vacuum box , " will suck on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass is changed by actual installation in the alumi  --  num frames which hang from the tower 's supports . Mr. Durgin , using figures from the instruments in the tower , will set up " wind tunnel " tests in the Wright Brothers Aeronautical Laboratory at MIT to get an exact reading on the " wind load " beating against the building . Similar to tests conducted at Purdue University before the tower was started , the wind tunnel can create any wind from any direction wafting over a scale model of Boston . " As far as I know , nobody 's ever done this before , " says the methodical Dr. Hansen . Panes have blown or broken out of other skyscrapers ? notably New York 's Chase Manhattan Bank and towers in Dallas and Milwaukee ? but the reasons are always different , reports Dr. Hansen. // Al ' photo Patte-jitl to behold *Hancock tower studied // Presumably a combined analysis of tests will give Hancock officials the answer they 're looking for : Whether to take out more panes of glass and replace it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether to add wind safety shields , or other possibilities . Costs soaring Hancock vice-president Albert E. Prouty estimates testing costs at $75,000 to $100,000 . Mr. Prouty " knocks on wood " in hopes of maintaining the " perfect safety record " upheld during construction . He says the biggest cost to Hancock is the delay in moving , postponed indefinitely from a February target . In the wake of public concern about fires in high-rise buildings , the insurance firm has also decided to install a sprinkler system in the mirrored-glass tower . Hancock 's problems have prompted the Boston City Council to consider an ordinance which would limit high-rise construction to 13 stories ( the height of the city 's fireladders ) through March , 1974 , while " studies " are conducted . The giant building , designed by I. M. Pei &; Partners , is covered by casualty insurance through another company ? good for window breakage and weather damage unless an architectural error is found to be the cause . The glass in the building 's shield is valued around $5 million . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company ; customers are wondering if the falling glass affects their policies in any way . Officials say " no . " Criticism rebutted " It 's the headline writers who got out of hand , " commented Jack Feeley , one of the company 's public relations officers . His job now is to correct Impressions of slipshod planning created by press reports which called the building " a lemon " and " a pain in the glass " At the same time , self-styled experts from all over are writing the company with suggestions and proposals for dealing with the glass problems . One , evidently a young boy from Maumee , Ohio , wrote : " I have a solution . You could put heavy screens over the windows . . Take it or leave it . " He drew pictures of the building with and without screens . Others , Dr. Hansen says , draw pictures of wind flow patterns and suggest ways to stablize the flow . " I do n't know if they 're too economical , " Dr. Hansen says , but he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ? ' blowin ' in the wind ' '
