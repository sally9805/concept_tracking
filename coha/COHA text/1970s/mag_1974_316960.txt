" Your Honor , the prosecution rests its case . " <P> When that declaration is made early this week by Prosecutor James Neal , it will be the best news yet in the Watergate conspiracy trial . Through eight turbulent weeks of sophisticated courtroom wrangling , the often dramatic testimony of polite , unshakable witnesses and the courtroom listening to taped White House conversations , Neal and his young team of assistant prosecutors have presented a devastating case against five former agents of President Richard Nixon . <P> The evidence that the five had conspired to cover up the true origins of the Watergate bugging and burglary is massive . It includes the playing of more than 20 hours of recordings , the appearance of 30 witnesses , the presentation of some 130 documents . If the deluge of material was sometimes bewildering , the rhythmic interjection of such confessed conspirators as John Dean , Jeb Stuart Magruder , Herbert Kalmbach and Fred LaRue giving their versions of cover-up activities , and the playing of tapes that verified their testimony was overwhelmingly effective . The most promising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might conceivably hold out and produce a hung jury , which could result in a new trial . <P> Ironically , the best chance of that happening rests on how clearly the tapes , including some never publicly revealed before , show that Nixon was the increasingly desperate leader of the cover-up strategy . He not only lied to the public but often to the aides who were risking their own freedom to protect him . Some jurors might refuse to convict in the belief that it would be unfair to imprison the aides while Nixon escapes criminal prosecution because of President Ford 's pardon . The Nixon on the tapes , in fact , sounds more devious than the men on trial . <P> Bugging Plan . Indeed , the new tapes provide the first evidence suggesting that Nixon might even have ordered the intelligence-gathering plan that led to the bugging of Democratic national headquarters . On a March 27,1973 tape , H.R. Haldeman told Nixon that " the final step " in putting the bugging plan in operation occurred when Haldeman 's aide , Gordon Strachan , called Magruder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the President wants it done and there 's to be no more arguing about it . " Magruder , according to Haldeman , passed this presidential order along to former Attorney General John Mitchell , who said , " O.K. , if they say to do it , go ahead . " Nixon 's only reaction on the tape to Haldeman 's narrative was an angry-sounding expletive : " Shit . " <P> Except for this ambiguity , the tapes show that despite all of the former President 's denials , he had 1 ) promised Executive clemency for various Watergate defendants ; 2 ) approved the paying of hush money to the burglars and knew that this could be an obstruction of justice ; 3 ) plotted to first make Magruder and Mitchell , then Dean , the scapegoats so as to save himself . Even many of the transcripts released by the White House last April in a televised profession of belated candor were revealed by the playing of the tapes to have been edited to omit the most damaging statements and thus continue the coverup.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
