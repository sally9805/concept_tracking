Obesity is one of the most common medical complaints in the U.S. today . Depending on the choice of surveys , anywhere from one-tenth to one-quarter of the population is overweight to some extent , and millions of people unhappy about their girth and concerned about their health spend more than $400 million a year on reducing drugs and treatments . Physicians interested in the subject have even formed the American Society of Bariatrics ( from the Greek baros , meaning weight ) to study the problem collectively . The field has nowhere to go but up ; medical science has so far failed miserably to help the heavyweights in any important way . <P> <P> This was the admission of bariatricians and other physicians meeting in Washington last week . The average family doctor treats ten or more patients a month for overweight . A relatively small number have obvious metabolic disorders that can be checked . For most of the rest , the problem is simply excessive eating , and doctors have not found a way to control that for very long . A 250-lb. man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut his caloric intake by more than half . By his eating standards , that would be close to starvation . It is easier to dry out drunks than to starve down heavy eaters . <P> Fad diets , the experts feel , have only temporary effect , and some can be medically unsafe . Drugs that dull the appetite , like amphetamines , help certain people for a while , and some doctors prescribe drugs in conjunction with diets . But no one considers pills a long-term answer because of side effects and the chance of addiction . Many extremely obese people eat heavily because of emotional problems . For these patients , psychotherapy can provide clues about the basic causes of the trouble and sometimes helps ease the anguish of kicking gluttony . The key element is usually motivation . Group sessions on the style of Alcoholics Anonymous benefit some people more than orthodox medical approaches do . <P> Regardless of method , the quest for permanent slimness is rarely rewarding . According to Dr. Alvan Feinstein of Yale medical school , the success rate of weight-loss programs is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out of every 100 obese patients , some doctors have found , only a dozen can be expected to lose significant amounts of weight in a yearlong treatment program . Of that happy dozen , ten can be expected to gain back their excess poundage during the following year .
