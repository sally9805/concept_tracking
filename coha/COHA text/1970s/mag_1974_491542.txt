to most people , the term Western art means cowboys and Indians , bright colors , plenty of action , and the names Remington and Russell . But there is so much more . First of all , Western art is uniquely American . The artists who went West recorded through their paintings an important era in the history of our country : the great migrations to dangerous , unknown regions , the Indian wars , and the advent of the cowboy , rancher , and cattleman . In addition , today , just as much as in the past , the West represents an amazingly fertile area of creativity for the artist . From the very beginning , adventure and romance have been synonymous with the word " West . " Contemporary artists are still drawn to the region . They seek the same wide-open spaces , the same incredibly vivid colors , unique lighting , and above all , the individualism of people still living in the West . On the following pages , the Post presents a microcosm of Western art through the private collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Hills have been collecting Western art for thirty-one years . The works of art presented on the next few pages span more than eighty years , between 1890 to the present , and , as some of the modern paintings in the collection indicate , Western art has never been more alive . Almost from the beginning , the world has carried on a love affair with the West . It is still a way of life to see cowboy hats and Indian jewelry on the streets of Rome , and Western movies with Japanese actors in Tokyo theaters . In contrast , however , the public has lightly regarded and even neglected Western art for many years . True recognition of its quality and vitality has come only in the last two decades . Today , growing numbers of Americans , like Margaret and John Hill , are under the spell of the free spirit and straightforwardness of Western art . They are discovering not only the beauty and excitement artists and illustrators captured at the turn of the century when the West was still wild , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went West in the 1880 's and 90 's were a special breed . In the words of Ed Ainsworth , author of The Cowboy in Art , " Stamina , endurance , and courage were essential in the wilderness , whether a man carried a gun or a paintbox . " These men were inspired to travel West by popular literature and on-the-scene reports from the wildlands . For example , despite the fact that no artists were eyewitnesses to the Battle of Little Big Horn , the story of Custer 's death has evoked an estimated 848 paintings and drawings ! Today one immediately associates Western art with paintings of Indians , but according to Robert Taft , who wrotethe scholarly Artists and Illustrators of the Old West , it was not until 1890 that artists even considered the Indians worth painting . It is ironic to note that by 1900 the desire to paint Indians was a primary reason for the birth of the now-famous art colony in Taos , New Mexico . The artists who flocked to Taos found that the Indians who lived in the pueblos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their culture and dignity , and a way of life close to nature . Van Deren Coke , in his Art History of Taos and Santa Fe , explains the migration to Taos . The artists were " drawn at first by the romantic concept of recording what was thought of as a dying race .... " They discovered instead a secure tribe which has had continuous and vital existence for over 450 years . And they discovered as well that Taos was an almost ideal setting for artists because of its long season of clear sunlit weather , wide range of colors , and landscape striking in its grandeur and austerity . By 1915 , there were over 100 artists in Taos , including Couse and Berninghaus , whose paintings are reproduced on the following pages . Today there is still a sizable group of artists living and working in Taos . They and the other Western artists throughout our country are heirs to a tradition of adventure and romance in painting . What is significant is the artists ' response to that heritage  --  not only are they carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it new depth and meaning with vital and exciting creations . In 1885 , Theodore Roosevelt saw a way of life  --  that of the ranchmenvanishing . He wrote : " We ourselves ( the ranchmen ) and the life that we lead , will shortly pass away from the plains as completely as the red and white hunters who have vanished before our herds . The broad and boundless prairies have already been bounded and will soon be made narrow , It is scarcely a figure of speech to say that the tide of white settlement during the last few years has risen over the West like a flood ; and the cattlemen are but a spray from the crest of the wave , thrown far in advance , but soon to be overtaken . " Yet Teddy Roosevelt 's contemporaries , Frederic Remington , Charles Russell , and all the rest , preserved that way of life in their paintings , and today the spirit of the West lives in the art of a large group of creative men and women . John Hill , for one , believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially the Taos School will be ranked as equal to the other great art movements of the last century such as Impressionism and Cubism . The wide variety , creativity and action on the following pages seem to support his thesis . v ? ? .
