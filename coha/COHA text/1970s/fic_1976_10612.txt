Febuaries , as Cronkite and half his tribe would say . I walked on past the Hammond cottage , which I will never get over thinking of as the Catlin place , though Marian died and John and Debby moved away four years ago . People we loved ; there are too few of them . The very sight of their house darkened the day again for me . Nobody home , as usual . Mrs. Hammond sells real estate , the girls are in school , and old Hammond is off in Baluchistan or somewhere training gendarmerie for the Iraqi government , exportingAmerican know-how to help put down the Kurds  --  the valiant Kurds , as I remember them from " Sohrab and Rustum , " the Kurds who are demandeen self-government , as I hear from Cronkite . Damnation . Instantly irritable , I compose a letter to the press instructing news commentators that those who use the language publicly and professionally should be advised that there are two is in February , that ing is not pronounced een , and that verbs enjoy other possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it has called a meeteen of business leaders for early Febuary . Just saying it to myself , like the old pantaloon I am getting to be , brought my blood pressure up to about 250/200 , and when I found that the mailbox was empty , that the postman was late again , I announced a loud God damn to the startled creekside and sat down to wait on a pile of timbers that was once a bridge until I replaced it with a culvert . My internalgrumblings went on , the way a high-compression engine running on low-octane gas will go on galloping and coughing and smoking after the ignition is shut off . It 's a bad sign , I know it . Ruth tells me at least once a day that old people , or people getting old , tend to disengage , back away , turn inward , listen only to themselves , and get self-righteous and censorious . And they must n't . ( I must n't . ) She hates to drive anywhere with me because I am inclined to cuss out drivers who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cries . They ca n't hear you . All you do is upset me . It lets off steam , failing which Ip11might explode , I tell her . ' What are you doing now but exploding ? she asks . Right , absolutely right . Faultfinding does n't let off pressure , it only builds it up . It is only one of many processes , none of which I like and most of which I ca n't seem to help : the decreasing ability to stand heat or cold , something to do with the expansion and contraction of the capillaries . The slowing down of the mitotic rate in body cells , with resultant deterioration and lessening of function . The accumulation of plaque in the artery walls and of calcium spurs in the joints and of uric acid , sugar , and other undesirablechemicals in the blood and urine . Inescapable , irreversible , hateful . Like last week , when the dentist told me that the molar he has been trying to save by root canal work will have to go . I can read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First a bridge , if he can find anything to hitch it to . Then a partial plate . Finally a complete cleaning out of old snags in preparation for false teeth , on television called dentures . There will be a morning when I look in the mirror and see an old sunken-cheeked stranger with scared eyes and a mouth like a sea urchin 's . I can stand it , and I really ought to try not to let it and other things make me crabby . But I damn well do n't look forward to it , and I do n't like any of the signs that the cookie has already started to crumble . The other day at the museum the young thing at the gate took one look at me and said brightly , " Senior citizen , sir ? " and passed me out half-price tickets . That shook even Ruth . The way I felt , half price was an overcharge . I had been sitting on the old timbers for about ten minutes when Ben Alexander drove in from the county road in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangled , and he had Edith Patterson in the seat beside him , looking like a raccoon in her wraparound Hollywood shades . It was all so young and gay and California that I had to laugh . Ben is the very chief of the tribe that makes old age out to be a time of liberation . He is writing a book about it.  |p12He  stopped beside me and ran down the window and sat looking at me with his hands on the wheel . Until he finally retired a couple of years ago he used to be my doctor , and he can still make me feel as if I am sitting there on the table , ridiculous in my shorts , waiting for the rubber hammer under the kneecaps and the steel handle against the soles of the feet , and the finger up under the scrotum ( cough ) , and the rubber glove up the ass trespassing on my most secret prostate . ( How 's the urine ? Good stream ? Have to get up in the night ? ) He is a man I admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , their own and others ' . Maybe that is what keeps me from ever quite relaxing around him , for I am one of those to whom life happens . Maybe I disbelieve his pollyanna doctrines about old age . Or maybe it is only the doctor-patient relationship that makes me slightly uneasy . It is hard to be relaxed around a man who at any moment might examine your prostate . His gray medical eyes were noting the condition of my eyeballs , my paunch , the stiffness with which I stood up , for all I know the spots on my lungs and liver . " Resting , roosting , or nesting ? " he said . Edith , with her curved , reflecting blackout windows turned toward me , made a little smile . " Brooding , " I said , and rose and dusted off my pants . " Molting . Hello , Edith . Do n't you know a girl can be compromised , running around in a convertible with this old rooster ? " Which was plausible enough to be not so plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see a woman with him . His wife , who was wonderful and whom he adored , died several years ago . Ben is seventy-nine , he has sons over fifty and grandsons who have voted in the last two presidential elections , he wears a hearing aid when he wants to hear from the right side , a pacemakeris implanted under the skin of his chest , and his left hip joint is aluminum , newly installed . Nevertheless , with vitality like his , you never know . As for Edith , she is always a little cool and aloof and amused . Not unattractive  --  she is as attractive a sixty-year-old as you ever saw . Her air of faintly mocking imperturbability has a remem/brance of Dietrich sultriness about it , and though I never saw anything even slightly askew between her and Tom Patterson , an architect whose name is as well known in Karachi and Tel Aviv as in his home town , and who has had two operations for cancer of the tongue , that did n't prove anything either . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breathless posterity is that anything is possible at any time . " They fight for the privilege , " Ben said . " What are you doing , waiting for the mailman ? " " What else do you do for the damned mailman , except give him five dollars at Christmas ? " " Ruth home ? " " Yes . " " Edith wants to see her a minute . Edith , why do n't you take the car and go on up ? I 'll sit down here and console Joe . " Edith , who had been looking off down the creek , turned her black windows again . The molded mouth and nose and cheeks below them were expressionless . She nodded , and as Ben got out , helping himself with a cane , she slid over , put the car in gear , quirked her mouth in the slightest of smiles , and drove on . Ben stood with his cane planted and both hands stacked on it and looked down on me from his stooped six feet five . " I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " How 's Tom ? " " He 's a dead man . I 've just been down at the clinic with Edith while she heard it from Arthur . " " Oh , Christ . I thought she was being pretty silent . " " She 's all right . You know what she wants to see Ruth about ? " " What ? " " To tell her she ca n't play the piano for the shut-ins for a while . Wants to arrange for someone else . " I thought about how much my mind would be on those shutinsif I 'd just got Edith 's news . " That 's touching , " I said . " Does Tom know ? " " He 's known for a week . I talked with him . " The gray corkscrews of hair stood up on his head . The breath he breathed down on me was loud and sour . " We both thought it was betterp14she should hear it from his doctor . Tom could n't quite tell her . That 's a very close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 're always so composed about everything you get to thinking of them as unflappable . " A little gust of wind came up the valley , the roadside darkened under a swift cloud shadow . I rubbed my goose-pimpled arms . " Well , damn everything , " I said . " Damn the clouds . Damn the dawdling mailman . Damn the collective carcinogens . How do doctorsstand being always cheek by jowl with the grim reaper ? " " Death ? " Ben said , surprised . " Death is n't that much of a problem . It 's as natural as living , and just as easy , once you 've accepted it . I 've been dead twice myself . Both times when they hooked up my pacemaker I died on them , and they revived me . " " Well , at least your book on old age has a logical ending . " I must have sounded bitter , because he fixed his old medical eyes on me again . " I have n't seen you around much lately . What 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You ought to wear a sweater in this kind of weather . Been having any more pain ? " " Who told you I 'd been having any pain ? " " Your doctor , " Ben said . " To whom I referred you . I looked at your last tests . Jim thought he might have depressed you with that diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis . Did he ? " " Depressed me ? No . I did n't exactly cheer , but I would n't say I 'm depressed . " " What 's he giving you ? " " Allopurinol for the uric acid , indocin for the pain , synthroid for general metabolic reasons , oronase for the blood sugar , something else for the cholesterol , I forget its name . I just take the handful of pills Ruth hands me . " " I forget , have you got a heart history ? " " Myocarditis once , years ago . Or pericarditis , endocarditis , nobody ever quite labeled it . I got these chest pains , and the electrocardiographwent crazy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and it went away after a while . "  |p15It  was just like his office . He made me feel defensive , standing there planted on his cane and scowling at me . IIe grunted and wheezed , and again I smelled his sour breath . It annoyed me to have this giant ruin acting as if he was immune and immortal , and probing around in my insides , when he was ten years closer to the edge than I was . Sure enough , he undertook to reassure me . " That 's one thing that suggests rheumatoid to Jim , that myocarditis , " he said . " It 's associated with rheumatoid the way rheumatic fever 's related to coronary disease . But I do n't necessarilybelieve he 's right . Lemme see your hands . " He examined the knuckles of the hand I held out , then ordered up and examined the other . He did not say what the inspection told him . " Even if he should be right , " he said , " you 're not to worry yourselfinto a wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheezy and loud , his voice rode over mine . We stood in the green angle of the roadways , with the creek rustling in its deep channel , as if we were engaged in a quarrel that we did n't quite want to make plain . " Diseases do n't live up to their full potential any oftener than people do , " he said . " You 've got at most one chance in five it will really cripple you . You get plenty of exer-cise ? " " We walk , I work in the yard . " " Good . You 're in good shape . You 'll make it into the eighties . " " Why , thanks , Doctor , " I said . " I appreciate the offer . " That old reptilian eye again , a snort through the long nose . " You know what you 've got ? You 've got a bad case of the sixties . The sixties are the age of anxiety . You feel yourself on the brink of old age , and you fret . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're like a man with an old car and no place in particular to go . You drive it where you want to , and every day it keeps on running is a gift . If you avoid the killer diseasesand keep the degenerative ones under control with a sensible diet and regular exercise and whatever chemotherapy you need to stay in balance , you can live nearly forever . Strictly speaking , therep16does n't seem to be any such thing as old age . You can keep chicken tissues alive indefinitely in a nutrient broth . " " You know , it 's a funny thing , " I said , " I never had the slightest desire to live in a nutrient broth . " I exasperated him . " You 're bored , with your garden . If I 'd been there when God set Adam and Eve in that perfect place I 'd have given them about four months . They 'd have lasted longer in Las Vegas . Who do you see ? Who are your friends , besides the ones I know ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Should I ? " " No . But she has this notion you do , that I need more people around . I never have needed many people around . I always had more than I wanted . A few friends are enough . There are lots of perfectly pleasant people whom I like , but if I do n't see them I do n't miss them . What kept me in New York was work , not people . When the work ended , most of the people ended , all but the handful that meant something . Maybe that 's alarming , but that 's the way I am . " " All right , " Ben said . " Some are . You do n't have to start going to Arthur Murray . But I 'm not kidding , old age is too God damned often self-inflicted . You do n't want to turn into a hermit saving string and bottle tops and running the neighbor kids out of your yard . Come out more . Come to lunch with me . " " Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And for God 's sake do n't go thinking yourself into any God damned wheel chair ! " He reversed his cane and thumped me for emphasis on the breastbone and almost knocked me down . " What the hell is that , , a shillelagh ? " " Have n't I shown you that ? " He held it up . To the shaft , which looked like cherry wood , had been fastened this big bone , obviously the ball of the ball and socket joint of some large animal . The knob was the size of a handball , with a frill of bone around its base and a two-inch shank of bone projecting from that and bound to the wood with a wide silver band . As the finial ofp17the polished , elegant stick of wood the handle was grotesque , the sort of thing any self-respecting dog would bury and never go back to . " That 's my hip joint , " Ben said . " When I broke my hip , and they had me in the operating room , the last thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that joint , I want it . ' I 'd walked on it for seventy-nine years and I damn well wanted to go on walking on it . " By then I was laughing and holding my nose and pushing away the cane that he held up in my face . The thing looked as if it might smell . " Could n't you at least have left it out in the sun to bleach ? " I said . " That 's an awful brown untoothsome-looking bone . " " That 's a sound bone . When I saw it I was proud , by God . Look at it . No spurs , no decalcification , no nothing . Except for that fall , it would have lasted me a lifetime . " The white convertible eased into sight around the corner of the hill by Hammonds ' . " Here comes Edith , " I said . " Do I act as if I know ? " He considered only a second . " I would n't . If it was me , I would n't hide it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go off by herself and grit her teeth . " She pulled up , impassive behind the glasses , her flat cheeks looking deceptively young , her mouth fixed in the usual expression of remote and forgiving amusement . Ben opened the door , she slid over , he got in and threw the cane into the back seat . " Think about it , " he said . " I 'll call you for lunch one of these days . " They lifted their hands and drove off , and I sat down again on the bridge timbers . I do n't respond gladly when other people show a willingness to direct my life , routines , or feelings . Ben has a way of making me feel about fifteen years old , an age that appeals to me even less than sixty-nine . He never doubted himself in his life . He is one of those people , insufferable when you think about them , who have always been able to do exactly what they set out to do . The son of a China missionary , he came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He became one , a very good one , some people think a great one . Even yet , when he has all but quit practicing , people come from a long way off to be treated by him . He has doctored everybody from Admiral Nimitz to Angela Davis , he has more celebrities in his files than I have , and on more intimate terms . I have only read their manuscripts and taken them to lunch and prepared their contracts and advanced them money and bailed them out of difficulties . He has examined their prostates , or the equivalent . Wanting money , he made it , made two or three million dollars . And give him credit , he practices what he preaches . When he built his big house in six hundred acres of foothills he did n't retire , he pulled the world out to him . It is about as secluded as Vandenberg Air Force Base . Two or three nights a week his Chinesecouple serve dinner to twenty or so people , the kind of people who have been everywhere and done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand bottles of extraordinary Cabernet Sauvignon . He is a director in a half dozen Peninsula electronics firms , he has served on a half dozen presidential commissions , he owns vineyards in Sonoma and ranches in Mendocino County , and he collects things  --  friends , books , money , limericks , dirty stories  --  the way an air filter collects lint . Also , I was thinking as I sat on my splintery 8X8 beam , he is one of the few men I know thoughtful enough to go down with Edith Patterson while she received her husband 's death sentence , or take a few minutes to read the lab tests of Joe Allston , a crybaby former patient , and make a special trip out to calm his mind . Grit my teeth , did I ? The hell I did . I complained by withdrawaland irritability and silence . Ten minutes with Ben Alexanderand I was resolving to quit being a sissy about growing old . Eventually the mailman 's red , white , and blue truck came in , and the mailman , as cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a little bundle . Most of the letters , as usual , were addressed to Boxholder or Resident . Those that were not seemedp19to be appeals . That is another symptom of retirementitis , the way the mail decreases in amount and significance . I put the bundle in my right-hand pocket and walked back up the lane , reading as I walked , and transferring the read items to the pocket on the other side.  |p20Enter  the unexpected  --  and I dislike the unexpected , as the man said , unless I have had a chance to prepare for it . The fourth item I took out of my pocket was a postcard , closely written , and forwardedfrom our New York address of nine years ago . At the bottom of the hill , at the last edge of sun , in the smell of crushed eucalyptusbuttons , I stopped and read it . Dear FriendsHow are you ? It is so long a time ! just outside this village , which you know , I am living a quiet life . My husband did suffer a stroke and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . He is like a child , he takes much care . The castle is as you saw it , no better  --  I see only Manon . But we have nothing and can not choose . I had to sell even my little Ellebackencottage , which I loved . But here where I grew up it is also beautiful . I walk and paint . Last month I had an exhibition in Copenhagen and sold nearly all . Often I wonder about you , if you have found your safe place . I wish much happiness to you both . Fondly , Astrid W/KThe other side of the card was a color photograph , taken from a high place , of a neat red-roofed village set between fields and woods at the edge of a tame sea . A boat harbor extended masonry arms into the water beyond warehouses and sheds . A little green island was afloat offshore . Bregninge . I am related to it , or once thought I was . I know that estate , which includes two other villages , the harbor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , orchards , fields , and an English park modeled on that of Warwick Castle , where peacocks parade around the lawns under oaks that any/where else in Denmark would have been cut down a century ago . I know the castle , too , a real slot , none of your mere thirtybedroommanor houses , and I know some of its history , which is enough to put your pyloric caecum into spasm . So that was where she ended . I was not really surprised . That was settled on Midsummer Night twenty years ago . She would now be sixty , Edith Patterson 's age . A quiet life , looking after a helpless husband , in her one available safe place . She might live to be my age  --  ten more years of ebb  --  or Ben Alexander 's , twenty . She might live , like her grandmother , to be nearly a hundred . When I got to the house , Ruth was sunning in the protected front patio . " Is n't it a funny day ? " she said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so warm when it 's out . " " Bolts and jolts . What did Edith want ? " " She ca n't play for the shut-ins for a while . She and Tom are going somewhere . " No confidences , then . So be it . " When do you want lunch ? " " Not right away , I guess . Can we wait till one ? I 'd like to go back down and work a little more . " " Fine , " she said , pleased , and took the mail I handed her  --  without the postcard  --  and turned herself to pondering the needs of Boys ' Town , the NAACP , and the Association for the AmericanIndian . I went down to the study and rummaged around in boxes until I found the diary I had kept , away back when I was sick and stuck in the sand and trying to winch myself out . It was written in three stenographic notebooks bound together with rubber bands that snapped when I stretched them . Thumbing the pages , I saw names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall visiting , references to feelings I would have sworn I never felt . It was like a letter from a dead Joe Allston to the one who survives , and it dealt  --  I knew it did before I read it , that 's why I went looking for it  --  with existential problems : Who am I ? How tohei ' - What is the meaning of everything ?  |p22I  started to read from the beginning , and it began to comer back . Some people , I am told , have memories like computers , nothing to do but punch the button and wait for the print-out . Mine is more like a Japanese library of the old style , without a card file or an indexing system or any systematic shelf plan . Nobody knows where anything is except the old geezer in felt slippers who has been shuffling up and down those stacks for sixtynineyears . When you hand him a problem he does n't come back with a cartful and dump it before you , a jackpot of instant retrieval . He finds one thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the annex , which directs him to the east wing , which sends him back two tiers from where he started . Bit by bit he finds you what you want , but like his boss who seems to bej under pressure to examine his life , he takes his time . Also , what he brings is not necessarily pleasant . It is a little like taking the top off the jar and letting the tarantula out , and not too unlike opening a grave . Alas , poor Allston . I knew him , Floratio . A fellow of infinite jest , but now strangely chapfallen . Lunch interrupted me before I got past the first notebook . In the afternoon there were errands in town , some plants to be set out , some firewood to cut  --  routines , I realize , with which I fence my life in away from the mankillers . Then a shower , then a drink , then Cronkite like a ghostly cricket creakeen where a house was burned , then dinner , then the dishes , and finally the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth in bed and I in the big chair , two old parties in a warm well-lighted room , with the televisionstanding by in case there should be something on worth watching , and the rest of the house dark and turned down in deference to that new American phenomenon , the shortage , we settled down for the evening , without interruption except when one or the other of us threw off old Catarrh , the Siamese , who at the age of ninety or so by human standards needs warmth too , and loves to creep up under your chin to sleep , and is never happierthan when he is lying on your book . Ruth is quiet and contented with her reading ; - bit- I am not . Until recently  --  until , in fact , the machinery began to show signsp23of wear  --  the Joe Allston sittinthere reading the diary of his predecessor has been pretending to be Marcus Aurelius , or the Cicero of " De Senectute " : stoic philosopher surprised by nothing , accepting everything , valuing only friendship , abstract integrity , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that . Take gratefully any pleasures the world provides , but do n't curse God when they fail . Nobody in the universe ever promised you anything . Most things break , including hearts . The lessons of a life amount not to wisdom but to scar tissue and callus . But it does n't work indefinitely . Crucifixion can-be discussed philosophically until they start driving the nails . Look at the way I was grumbling and whimpering down there with Ben this morning . The symptoms of failing vigor , the oncoming of age , have put me right back to where I was in 1954  --  which , come to think of it , was about where I was in 1924 . Young , middle-aged , or getting old , Joe Allston has always been full of himself , uncertain , dismayed , dissatisfied with his life , his country , his civilization , his profession , and himself . he has always hunted himself in places where he has never been , he has always been trying to thread some needle with a string that was raveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some continuity and assurance and sense of belonging , but has never had ancestors or descendants or place in the world . Little orphan Joe , what a sad case . His unappeased presence in the diary and in the big chair makes the Joe Allston of recent years , the one the neighbors here think they know , look less like Marcus Aurelius than like a prosy Polonius . The stoicism he hasp.retendedto is about as impressive as a telephone recording . His questions have never been answered and his hunger never satisfied . I only thought there had been some sort of accommodation because the spiritual epidermis , like the physical hide , thickens where it is rubbed . There is even a question if it thickens enough . From here , it is apparent that that Danish excursion was the most romantic quest since Parsifal 's , sure to end in a bloody nose . If you forget caution and start through the dark woods toward the dark tower , you are exposed , vulnerable , without guidance , and guilty . It may havep24been a water rat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby 's shriek . As for the maiden in distress , and Astrid was one , the dragon ate her . Here it is on the postcard . If there is a lesson in that pilgrimage into the Gothic , it is a lessonmisshapen , leaden , lightless , ugly as a toad in a drain , a real Grendel of a lesson left over from the time of trolls and demons . It leaves me no option but to scratch dead leaves over it as I scratched them over it twenty years ago . That seems the only method that will get us safely from infancy to senility . Was it the Boyg who advised Peer Gynt , " Roundabout , Peer , roundabout ? " Or was it the Button Molder ? Never mind . One of the books I read in Denmark was The Long Journey , by Johannes V. Jensen , a patriotic chronicle about how the Scandinaviansinvented everything , first sex , then fire , then tools , then shelter , then agriculture , then bronze and gold , then iron , until the human race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be trusted to go forward on its own . Jensen got a Nobel Prize for his fable of civilization , and he persuaded some people , including some Scandinavian archaeologists . Not me . I like the Scandinaviansas well as anybody else , and once went hunting my identity among them , but they did n't invent more than their share , and they are no monsters of goodness . Even now , when they have given up Viking raids and become the world 's umpires and ombudsmen , they consort with evil like other folks , and confuseit with good like other folks . I did n't find what I went looking for in Denmark , but I f nd there was something rotten in that state , as elsewhere , and that the Danes like the rest of the world are attracted to evil , are involved in it , even feel dutiful toward it . If the ghost of Henry James came demanding copy , I could tell him a tale of New World innocence and Old World experienceat least as instructive as Daisy Miller . Havingno traditions myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought that time really does sift men 's acts , that the good they do lives after them and gradually improves their descendants , and that the ill they do eventually writhes in pain and dies among its worshipers That was real innocence . Everythingp25we do lives after us . The future is not only now , as television assuresme , it was also then , and Baal and Loki are as immortal as Jahveh and Baldr . My mother was a Danish girl , an orphan and a runaway . She emigrated to America , all alone , at sixteen , worked as a hired girl , married a drunken brakeman who begot me and shortly got himselfkilled by a freight in the Sioux City yards , married again a couple of years later and was soon abandoned . Except for those brief spells of married bliss , she never had a house of her own . She lived , and I with her , in hot ( and cold ) third-story rooms and back-of-the-kitchen sheds in other people 's houses , and she died of a fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in college . Everything in the New World that she tied her hopes to , includingme , gave way . I spent my childhood and youth being ashamed of her accent , her clumsiness , her squarehead name , her menial jobs . It used to shrivel me to put down , in the space marked MOTHER 'S MAIDEN NAME . Ingeborg Heegaard . I never discovered until she was dead that she was a saint , and that realization , with all the self-loathing that came with it , put me into a tailspin that I did n't come out of for two years . Ulcers , nervous breakdowns , all the not so subtle psychosomatic punishments I visited on myself , went on till I learned how to scratch dead leaves over what I did n't want to see . That was the way it was until my only son , Curtis , who had been nothing but anguish from the time he was breech-born , fell from or let go of his surfboard on the beach at La Jolla . He died an over-age beach bum , evading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to make or help him be , and like my mother 's , his death lay down accusingly at my door . He was my only descendant , as she was my only ancestor , and I failed both . Chop , chop , there went both past and future . At fifty I had my second crisis  --  it is remarkable how apt bacteria and other agents of the moral sense can be , how readily they infect and afflict us when we need affliction . This time it was the myocarditis . But all the time while I was wondering if my clock would stop , I felt inside me somewhere , adjacent to or below the ailingp26heart , a hungry , thirsty , empty , sore , haunted sensation of being unfinished , random , and unattached , as if , even if the heart were working perfectly , there was nothing there for it to run . Marcus Aurelius and all , I have never stopped feeling that way . Sitting in the bedroom under three hundred watts of contemporaryillumination , I found myself reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R  --  dding , showed me his museum . Everything in it had been found on his estate . Dig anywhereon that island , and below the picnic plastics of the present you ran into the age of iron , and below that the age of bronze , and below that the age of polished stone , and below that the age of chipped stone , and still below that the age of antler and bone . All of it , straight down from the fourth millennium B.C. , was undiluted Danish . That impressed me , deracinated as I was . I suppose that an Indianon an Ohio mound might have the sense that down under him his own ancestors went in layers , generation below generation , all of them as native as the corn . But all other sorts of Americans , even those whose families have been on this continent for many generations , seem to me deprived , hanging around the nationalparks that enclose other people 's archaeology , or else , like me , tourists in a private graveyard hunting hopefully for their own names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those drinkingskulls and bowls , all those horn spoons and homed helmets , all those bronze axes and stone spearheads and antler flensing tools , were nothing to me but curios . I wanted to own a past the way R  --  dding owned his . Though I was watchful with Astrid 's brother , I envied him at least as much as I was suspicious of him . He had a lot of things I did n't especially covet and one I coveted very much : he belonged . to something . His prize exhibit was under a big bell jar on a table in the middle of the room . When it was first dug up , and the air hit it , it had begun to crumble , and R  --  dding had rushed it to Copenhagen to get the museum there to put it under glass . Deteriorated or not , it was recognizably human . It lay curled on its side with itsp27knees drawn up , a small , shrunken man with a bent nose and high cheekbones . An odd , cocky , Robin Hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cords bound its hands and feet , a rawhide strangling-cord was twisted into the neck under the ear . Its eyes were closed . On its mouth was what must have been the grimace it made when the cord was tightened , but it looked like a whimsical , knowing smile . While we were looking at it and talking about it , R  --  dding for a joke claimed it as his ancestor . I looked at him  --  he figures as the Prince Orgulus , or Dragon Error , or maybe the windmill , of this romance  --  and damned if he did n't look like it , with the same littlesmirking smile . Shrink him and dry him out , and he could have been the relative that he claimed to be . Maybe , in fact , he was . That was what a real past could do for you. just about then I had an idea . I got up , avoiding Ruth 's questioninglook , and went out into the wind and down to the study . In the third album I looked through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen Blixen sitting under a tree in her garden at Rungstedlund . Under her old garden hat her face was bird-sharp , leather-skinned . She was tiny , shrunken , her eyes as alive as snakes : as surely a witch as any old woman in one of her tales . In her hand she was holding a rune stone she had dug up only a few minutes before we arrived , and on her face was a look of glee , a smugness of secret knowledge , as if the murky world she visited every night on her broomstick had just sent her , in the cryptic markings on the stone , a daylight message that only she and her wizard and warlock friends could read . Sure enough , she looked like Rodding , and even more like that mummy of his . The same smile . Which should not surprise me . Karen Blixen was a baroness , and related to Astrid and Astrid 's brother . From all I ever saw of the Danish nobility , they are all cousins ; they have been marrying one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Airedales . Still , it was a little spooky to have that lovely , subtle Danish writer looking back at me out of the snapshot with thep28same knowing , Old World smile that I had seen twenty years beforeon the face of a Bronze Age mummy from a peat bog . I closed the study and went back . There was a big wind up . The live oak sawed and groaned , and the light fastened to its trunk glared up into threshing shadows . Petals from the wild plums in the woods below blew across the lighted dome of the tree . Going up the path was like being pounded from behind by pillows , and the wind tried to take the door away from me as I opened it . I came inside in a flurry of wind , fine rain , and plum blossoms . Ruth lowered her book to her lap and looked at me and laughed . Then she just sat there watching me like Little Red RidingHood 's grandmother  --  white hair , spectacles , Groucho Marx eyebrows , amused house-detective eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study . " " What for ? " " Look something up . " " Sounds as if the storm 's finally coming in . " " Big wind . Not much rain yet . " A moment 's silence , the widening smile . " You going to read some more now ? " " I thought I might . Why ? " " Then you 'd better wipe the flowers off your glasses . " I removed my glasses and wiped the plum blossoms off and settledback down in the chair . She kept watching me . " What is this you 're reading so interestedly ? " I was already wishing I 'd left the notebooks in the study , where I could have read them in the morning in privacy . I did n't suppose there was anything in them that could n't be read to Ruth , because I am not a confider , even in myself . Nevertheless , ever since that postcard had showed up in the mail , I had had a half-irritablesense of wanting to be alone with what it revived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What papers ? What papers are there ? The only papers , the files , the evidence . Allston was here . "  | " It does n't look like letters . " " You know why ? " I said . " Because it is n't . It 's a notebook  --  three notebooks . " " Notebooks about what ? " " It 's a journal . Diary . " " Whose ? Where 'd you get it ? " " Mine . I got it out of a cardboard carton . " " I mean who wrote it ? " I settled deeper and found my place and became absorbed . " I did . " But she was n't letting me get away with that . ' When her curiosityis up she can read your genetic code with the naked eye . " Come on , " she said . " You do n't keep a journal . " " I did this time . " " When ? " " Denmark . " " Denmark ? " I was getting a little exasperated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Det er ret . What 's wrong with keeping a journal in Denmark ? " She was still , and I went back to reading . But of course I did n't . I could feel her oyerthereruminative , abstracted , and unsatisfied , and when I cast a look across , there she was , propped against the pillows , her book lowered onto her stomach , one arm restraining old Catarrh , her eyes on me and her face wearing the impenetrableexpression that means she is thinking , estimating , remembering , uncovering discrepancies , drawing conclusions . She made a little embarrassed sort of smile and blinked her eyes . " Read it to me ? " she said . She caught me by surprise . Normally she is n't much interested in all these papers she keeps me working at . So long as I disappear after breakfast , she can feel that she has done her duty and propped me up so that I can hold my own against deterioration . But of course she would be interested in any diary I kept in Denmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not eager to read it to her , at least not until I had gone through it myself . " It is n't anything , " I said . " You know  --  blah-blah . Up thisp30morning betimes , and to the barber . Shave , thirty-five cents , newspaper , ten cents , miscellaneous , twenty-five cents . " She said in her soft Bryn Mawr whisper , " I was watching you while you read it . " " What ? " I had heard her all right , but I have been trying for forty years to make her speak loud enough to be heard . " I was watching you while you read it , " she said in exactly the same voice . I abandoned that line . " Do n't be misled by my gales of laugh-ter . " It matters to you , " she said ; and then , in a tone almost accusatory , " You never told me you were keeping a journal then . " Which was true . Secret sin , furtive navel-picking . And unfair , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , Curtis was her son as well as mine , but it was my therapy that Danish trip was supposedto serve . The way I must have thought of it , She came along to look after me . And then that irruption of the irrational , that reversion into adolescence . We had never talked about it , we had only dropped it . Regret and guilt are selfish and secret emotions . " It was a mistake , " I said . " It is n't my kind of caper . It embarrassesme . " The look she was bending on me from the bed was troubled and troubling , steady , undisguised by any of the games we play . She was n't sparring , or joking , or half joking . " Joe , " she said , " why not aloud ? Why not together ? " Very uncomfortably I said , " It really is n't anything . It 's mostly just what we did abroad . Our trip to the Paris of the North . Danish castles from Kronborg to Knuthenborg . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolishness that I regret . And anyway , it 's long gone now . " " Astrid and all that business ? " " Yes , some of that , I guess . I have n't read it clear through . " " And us . " " Us ? Yes , naturally . " " Please ? I think it might begood for us. "  | " Oh , hell , " I said . " Here , the reason I dug it out , we got this today . " I scaled the postcard over onto the bed and she read it , taking a long time . She turned it over and studied the picture of Bregninge and then turned it back and read it again . " Oh dear , " she said after about five minutes . " It makes you want to cry . " I said nothing . " She was such a nice woman , " Ruth said . " I liked her . I liked her as well as anybody I ever knew . " " I know . Or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her for a long time . " " No . " " Why did n't you give me the card before ? " " I do n't know . I just wanted to , sort of , look it up . " You can live with someone a long time and not have more than a few moments as exposed and intimate as that one . Ruth 's face was full of questions , but I could n't see any hardening or accusationthere . Pleading , rather . She said softly and hesitantly , " Would it be . . . painful to read it ? " What could I say ? Only that okay , sure , I 'd walk out in the open without any clothes on , if that was what she wanted . And no , of course it would n't be painful . Why should it be ? I flipped open the first notebook . " It probably wo n't make either of us particularlyhappy , " I said . " It was n't a very happy time . You want all that business about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You took notes on that ghastly voyage ? " " Ghastly detail by ghastly detail . I lost my faith in God 's justice when that ship ran into the Andrea Doria and it was the Andrea Doria that sank . " " What year was that ? " " When the Stockholm rammed the Andrea Doria ? " " No . When we went to Denmark ? " " Nineteen fifty-four . " The odd tension and nakedness of the moment had passed . We were both being casual . " You want to hear this ? "  | " I 'll be quiet . I was just getting oriented . " She laid aside her book , folded her hands around Catarrh and pulled him up against her , snuggled her back into the pillows , and looked expectant , like a child who has got her way and extracted one more bedtime story . She overdid it , on purpose , I suppose , and had to laugh . After a second , so did I. The woman is shrewd . The soft , heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the windows . Nothing could have been snugger , or more secure , or more transitory . " Getting oriented ? " I said . " Are n't we all . "  |p33S.S  . Stockholm , one day out , March 26 : It just struck me that if we had n't taken off on this trip we would tonight be attending Robert Frost 's eightieth birthday party , completewith personalities and tensions . Glad to be leaving all that behind for a while . Full of resolutions : look after myself , for a change . Get my health back . Forge in the smithy of my soul the untreated conscience , etc . Settle some things . Read , absorb , learn , think . Sounds silly but probably is n't . Above all , relax . Learn to sleep again . Quit being such a puritan , file the point off the prick of conscience , quit crying mea culpa , quit beating the breast , quit pitying myself . Accept . The past is past , I ca n't do a thing about it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , the world belongs to the living . Very rough . Thanks to Dramamine , we remain vertical , but barely . Wind forty knots , which according to the Beaufort Scale of Winds on the bulletin board is a fresh gale . Approximately , it plucks the hair from your head . Bad luck at table  --  only survivors besides ourselves a pair of old Swedes . He has sold his Omaha grocerystore and is taking his Minnesota-born wife back so they can live out their golden years in the village near Goteborg that he last saw in 1905 . Oh boy . They are awkward and diffident , and would get chummy on the slightest invitation , but I know this kind from childhood  --  pious , censorious , opposed to smoking drinking cardplaying dancing movies books language thinking . They sit in lace-curtained parlors and tsk-tsk on an indrawn breath , they know every unwanted pregnancy in town sooner than the girl does , they want English teachers in Augustana College fired for assigning A Farewell top34Arms , they wrote the Volstead Act . And touching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I do n't mean political exiles , who are another breed ; I mean immigrants who left the old country they were at home in in order to better themselves in the land of opportunity ) . The trauma of exile petrifies them . Forever will they love , and the old sod be fair . They bring it all with them , in its 1890 or 1900 version , and they plant it in America without modification and then spend the rest of their lives defending it against change , while in the old country what they knew changes so as to be unrecognizable . I would n't want to be old Bertelson when he finds that in modern Sweden the Lutheran Church has become nothing but a registry of births and deaths , and that the sexual habits of young Swedes make the objectionablegoings-on in Omaha lovers ' lanes look like sandbox play . And how their hound-dog eyes reproach me , otherwise quite a pleasant man , when I order a bottle of Pouilly-Fume to go with the fish . I offer some to them , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her glass as she might clap hands over her private parts if offered rape . They are curious why worldlings like us should be going to Denmark , and when they learn from Ruth that we have no businessthere , but still are intending to stay for several months , and that my mother came from there and that we might look up thevillage where she was born , they instantly construe me as an ally . I too am fleeing Gomorrah , looking backward toward the good old ways . It irritates me to see myself in those two cracked distorting mirrors , standing in front of some thatched cottage filled with yearning thoughts and fulfillments . Early to bed to read . So rough the bureau drawers keep falling out . I tie them shut with the rubber clothesline some well-wisher gave us for our drip-dry . The sentiments of The Lonely Crowd prove to be , as Huck Finn said of another book , interesting but tough , and I lay it aside to study Danish . Samples of the beauty of that language : en smuh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower . I make myself half sick practicing glottal stops , which crop up atp35random in Danish sentences and make everything sound like hiccups , regurgitations , and death rattles . March 27 : Wind fifty-two knots  --  whole gale . This knife blade of a ship , fast and unstable as a destroyer , wallows and heels and shudders through the enormous seas . The horizon tilts , sinks , rotates , lifts . Wind off the port bow , foredeck emptied and everything lashed down , now and then big waves coming aboard . Dining room nearly empty at breakfast . Do n't know about noon  --  did n't go . Dinner ditto . Dramamine , Zwiebach , and yoghurt . Steward urges Rullemops , pickled herrings , as a seasickness cure , and I vomit him out of the cabin . Better now , but Ruth really miserable . Berths keep filling with bureau drawers despite all my rigging . March 28 , 29 , 30 : There went a lost weekend , and we might lose the whole week . Wind now fifty-four knots , between a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berth , but I totter out , groggy with Dramamine and misled by that Lutheran conscience I seem to share with the Bertelsons , to try the gym , take a workout , get the blood moving and the gorge nailed down . The Stockholm is like a drunken elephantdancing  --  down by the bow , over to port , up by the stern , over to starboard , up by the bow . I make my way down to C deck like a marble bouncing down a pinball machine . The weights I work out on are one second as heavy as houses , and the next slack in my hands . I try a sauna and come out fast  --  too smothery . The masseur slaps his table , but I ca n't bear the thought of being mauled . Settle for a swim . As I step into the pool 's shallow end the ship begins its long shuddering lean to port , and the pool goes away : I pursue it down the slippery tiles . It stops , pasted against the far wall . The ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankles , my calves . I crouch , ready to launch into a breast stroke , and hang on , here it comes ! When the tidal wave has passed , I pick myself up out of the corner and get out of there . In all that place ofp36dampness and shining tile , amid the machinery of physical fitness installed to make travelers happy , not a living creature except the lonely masseur and me . March 31 : Today we should be debarking the Bertelsons at Goteborg . God knows where we are  --  I doubt that the captain does  --  but we 're a long way from Goteborg . As for the Bertelsons ' dream , that has been postponed to a better world . This is how : The wind went down some today , and some of the groundhogs came out , including our other table mates : a cheerful Dane from Fyn , an apple and cherry grower who has been in Florida helping his brother with an orange grove , and a silent Norwegian who ate everything on the menu from Rullemops to mints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their dinner , scandalizing the Bertelsons . But the Bertelsons were n't driven away . Quelled , scared , out of their known place , they seemed to want to hang onto Ruth and me for safety . They even tagged along to the lounge , where dancing was announced , and watched us at the devil 's work . The devil 's work was never so difficult . Try dancing on a hiproofedbarn in an earthquake . We slid into the chairs on every roll , and crosshatched our way uphill again , and were tilted forward and slid into the opposite chairs . The piano was bolted down , but the bench was not , and the piano player kept alternatelysliding clear under his keyboard and then out beyond arm 's reach . We could not have kept it up more than a few minutes at best , but the best did n't occur . On one of the Stockholm 's salmon leaps through the sea there was a wrench and rumble , the pianist yelped and fell sideways out of the way , and the piano slid ponderouslydown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , belching and dozing among the wallflowers . By the time we had the piano cornered and tied down , and a couple of stewards had come running with a stretcher and slipped and slid and teetered the Norwegian off to the infirmary , I became aware that Bertelson too was down , vomiting on the deck ,  |p37with  his wife trying to hold him back from sliding into his mess . So they carried him off too . The word a half hour later was that he had had a coronary , and was dead . Oh , his poor wife ! Ruth said when I told her . Yes . Oh , his poor wife . Oh , his poor dream . Oh , his poor fifty years of dull work with its deferred reward . Oh , his poor dim dependable unimaginativenot very attractive life that was supposed to mature like a Treasury bill . Ah , Bertelson ! Ah , humanity ! As I write this , Ruth is asleep , and whimpering with some sad dream . The bureau drawers come slowly out , stretching the rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll eases and starts the other way , are shot back into place like sluggish crossbowbolts . The wind is up again , as rough as it has been at any time on this miserable crossing . Nothing for me to do but lie and listen , not too confidently , to my heart , and be chased from side to side by things I do n't want to think of but ca n't shut out . At least when I was seasick there was n't that . They say you are never seasick in battle . The corollary is that you never battle when seasick . But who can stay seasick all the time ? April 1 : Bertelson just missed dying on April Fool 's Day . With unseemlyhaste , urged by some consideration or other ( no refrigeration ? ) the ship got rid of him before the day of fools was more than barely begun . They must have been sewing him into his sack before he was cold . I had fallen asleep , finally , about three . Some time later I awoke with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion was different . She was not plunging forward with her straining roll , but wallowing with a horrible helplessness . I could not hear the engines , nor could I , when I stepped out of the berth , feel them in the floor . My watch said ten past five . At any minute I expected bells , shouts , cries of " To the lifeboats , " and I almost shook Ruth awake to start her dressing . But first I decided to look outside . The hall was brightly lighted , totally empty . Rows of closedp38doors . In robe and slippers I went up the companionway and into the lounge . It too blazed with light , it too was empty . The broken chairs had been taken away and the piano was once more bolted down , but not a soul , not a sound except the creaking of woodworkas the room warped and tilted to the heavy , helpless wallowingof the ship . I went to the doors and looked out across the starboard rail . The ship 's lights shone on the lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched it rise and rise until it was high above the rail , and I felt the ship shrink and slide from it . I looked deep inside it , deeper than I wanted to look , and then it fell off somewhere , and the ship rolled so that I grabbed the doorframe , and the light spread out over the hissing crests of farther waves , an appalling turmoil of water , an untreated waste without order or end or purpose , heaving and yelling through the dark that the ship 's little brightness only made more total . And rain falling onto it , slashing at the glassy sides , while the wind blew a stiff spray flat off the crests . ' Whoever would know the age of the earth , Conrad says somewhere , should look upon the sea in storm . The age or dispositionof the earth , he should have said . Then out of the corner of my eye I saw the glint of moving oilskins out on the foredeck . A cluster of figures huddled out there , hanging onto each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something at their center . They hulked like conspirators , bent away from wind and rain , and in my scared condition I had the wild idea they were planning like a lot of Lord Jims to abandon ship and let all the pilgrims perish . For a minute or two they leaned and clung together . Then they fell back into a ragged line , two of them bent and lifted , and there went Bertelson down the plank and into that appalling sea . There is no word for how instant his obliteration was . The secondafter they stooped , he was not . With hardly a pause the oilskinned figures started in , and I saw that two of them were supporting a third who sagged and staggered . Mrs. Bertelson . Why they let her watch that , God knows . Maybe , in her piety and wretchedness , she had insisted on seeing her husband go to God.  |p39I  fled ahead of them down the companionway and up to our own safe door . As I took hold of the knob I felt or heard the renewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back in my berth the Stockholm was beginning once more to drive her nose into the seas . So fast , so total an erasure . Spurlos verloren . And now this afternoon , with their raging efficiency or whatever it is , they 've alreadygot his wife out on the foredeck , wrapped in rugs and shot full of sedatives . The wind has dropped again , but not far , and the sea even in daylight is nothing she should be contemplating . There she sits , staring with dumb , drugged suffering at the North Atlantic . And a strange thing : now that she is stricken , people avoid her more than they did when she was only cowlike and uninteresting . Me too . Ruth sat by her for an hour and tried to talk to her , but I could n't . What would I have said ? I thought her husband foolish and bigoted and dull , and now that he is dead it would be hypocrisy to pretend differently . I would like to be able to suffer fools more gladly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their minds do n't work at least as fast as mine . Curtis too , Curtis too . Maybe , whenever I am tempted to be snobbish , I can make myself remember the chaos and old night that Bertelson vanished into . Not even the most foolish and bigoted member of Lutheran Christendom deservesto be wiped out like that . Also I ca n't forget that it was in the ocean  --  another and pleasanter ocean than this one , but part of the same element  --  that Curtis was knocked from or let go of his surfboard , and his last breath was water . Agents , like publishers , get to be instant readers  --  they could carry the gospel of Evelyn Wood through the world . Hamlet in twelve minutes , Tolstoi in twenty . My eye , ranging down the page , saw something coming that I did n't want to get into  --  some of the breast beating and the Why , why , why , where did I begin to do it wrong , how did I manage to destroy the one person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loving ? I wouldp40have given him a kidney if he had needed it , they could have transplanted my heart . So I became his schoolmaster and his jailer and his judge . I was not going to read all that to Ruth . Maybe I will go back and read it over , maybe I will read it many times , and maybe in tears , but I was n't going to dump it on her . With only the most momentary hesitation , I flipped that page and turned it under , and when I glanced up briefly I saw that she understood exactly what I had done . I went on reading , though what followed was n't much more cheerful than what I had censored . Once in college , trying to determine some optical truth or other , we taped distorting spectacles on a laboratory chicken and threw her some feed . At first she would cock her head , take aim , and miss a grain of corn by as much as an inch , but after a while she learned how to correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once she got the hang of it she was as accurate as ever with either eye . Well , right now , while Ruth sleeps and I do not , and this queasy ship carries us through the undiminished seas , I feel like a grain of corn , with the Great Chicken of the Universe standing over me taking aim . I do n't know whether she has binocular visionor not , she may be blind in both eyes for all I know . But she is not going to miss me when she pecks . I have made a point of not believing in distorting spectacles . Any hen worth a dollar can recover from them in a few hours . Bertelson probably thought he had her whammied with his sixty-five years of piety , and look what happened to him . Moral : You ca n't trust optics , but you can depend on appetite . Again I looked across at Ruth . She made a rueful , sympathetic smile , and her eyes were shiny . She obviously wanted to pat me and kiss me better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so miserable , and fighting yourself so . I guess I was so miserable myself on that voyage I did n't realize how bad it was for you . "  |p41Often  I submit to her sympathy . I depend on it , in fact . But right then I chose to be flippant . " Despite all my efforts , " I said . " I wore my bruised spirit in my buttonhole , and took frequent whiffs , and turned up my eyes , and you never noticed . " " But you did n't . You did n't let on to me . You kept it to your-self . " " And why not ? " I said . " That 's the beauty of a journal . That 's where you meet the really sympathetic audience . " She understood that , too , and it annoyed her . She pulled Catarrhdown from under her chin a little too impatiently , and had to disengage his claws from her dressing gown . " Why do you have to jeer ? " she said . " Whenever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to jeer and cover up . " Trapped in my own role , I said , not very originally , " Beneath this harsh exterior beats a heart of stone . " She stared at me as if she could n't believe me , and the longer she looked at me the more irritated she became . She is not a hard woman to exasperate , especially when I shy away from being comfortedor mothered . " Sometimes I think you should take your own advice , " she said . " What advice ? " " To suffer fools more glady . Beginning with yourself . " Having said that , she obviously found herself furious . She startledherself , I think , with her own vehemence . I might easily have said something that would have wounded and frustrated her even more . After forty-five years we can still , if we let ourselves , bristle and bump one another around like a pair of stiff-legged dogs . FortunatelyI played it light , for the fact was that I really had n't intended to hurt her feelings . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason to go on , but as the injured party she had to have the last word . " I wish I understood you . You drive me wild , you really do . For a change we 're doing something together , sort of reliving something , something as sad as it could possibly be , and important to us both , and you brought it all back so clearly , and I was interested , and touched , and then you have to start mugging and hoofing , and spoil it . "  |p42The  telephone rang , and since Ruth was encumbered with the cat , I reached across to the bed table and answered it . " Hello , Joe ? " Ben Alexander . On the telephone his voice is even wheezier , breezier , and louder than it is face to face . " Present . " " Been thinking . Why wait for lunch ? I want to have Tom and Edith up to dinner Friday . Can you and Ruth come ? " " Why , I guess so . Let me speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouthpiece and said to Ruth , " Ben wants us for dinner with the Pattersons Friday . Can we go ? " She checked the calendar and found nothing but a hair appointment . " Do you want to ? " " Do you ? " " Sure , I guess so . Why not ? But you 've been so funny lately about going out . " " I 'm always ready for Ben 's house , especially as long as he makes that Cabernet . " " That 's probably it , " she said , practically with a sniff . " All right , tell him yes . " I told him yes . " Swell , " he said . " Friday at seven . " Bang in my ear , as if he had tossed the instrument into its cradlefrom six feet away . " That old rip , " I said . " He 's got more left at nearly eighty than most of us had at eighteen . Running around in his convertible . Why has n't he got sore joints ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes you think he does n't ? " Ruth said . " He 's got that metal hip joint , he walks with a cane , his heart runs by electronics , he 's alone , and probably lonely . Why do you think he 's any luckier than you ? " " I did n't say he was luckier . I said he had more left than anybodyhis age should have . Sons of missionaries must learn early to get around God . " " Come on , " she said , and let her hands fall and her shouldersp43droop as if in defeat . " Come on , read some more before we get into a real fight . " " You do n't want to hear any more . " " Of course I want to hear more ! " " The perils of the deep are nearly over , " I said . " From here on it 's less profound but with more local color . " April 3 : Goteborg , two days late . In three hours ashore I discover that the solid ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doped with more than a week of Dramamine , I stand looking at statues and town halls and into store windows , and as I look they start to lean and roll . Which is maybe the way things look to Mrs. Bertelson , too . She is met by a couple of relatives and a representative of the Swedish-American Line and driven off the dock in a car . The Swedish-American Line man has to interpret  --  Mrs. B 's in-laws have no English , and she ca n't understand their Swedish . Just before she got in the car she threw a desperate look back up at the ship and saw us at the rail . We waved . Her face worked . A word formed on her lips . Good-by , she said , probably not to us . Probably to Omaha , where the house and the grocery store were gone and could n't be returned to , and to Minnesota , where her roots were cut , and to the only one who could have dealt with her problems for her , who had gone off that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours before . Good-by . And vanished into a confusionhardly less than what he had gone into . April 4 , Hotel d'Angleterre : Quiet run this morning down the Oresund in the rain , with Sweden dim on the left and Denmark dim on the right . Hamlet 's castle at Helsingor loomed up awhile , guarding the narrows , and then a stretch of shore with villages and houses like Monopoly pieces among the leafless trees , and then Copenhagen , the harbor full of traffic , the Little Mermaid wet and cold on her rock , and finally we nudged and snuggled against a pier overhung with ap44railed platform on which hundreds of people smiled and waved and held up signs : Velkommen til Danmark . Velkommen Doktor Holger Hansen . Velkommen Onkel Oskar. leg Elsker Dig , Kristin Mollerup . The rain came down on them , half of them without umbrellas , and their wet faces shone , and they cheered and waved and held tip their banners till the rain melted the paper and ran the paint . Altogether the healthiest , happiest people we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by grappling hooks , but we are happy to accept their wavings and welcomings as if they were meant for us personally . Escaped from the deep . Praise the Lord . As I write this , Ruth has gone hunting an apothek or some place where she can buy toothpaste and postcards . She is all recovered , I am still woozy . I sit here by the window overlooking the big square called Kongens Nytorv , nibbling Rullemops and drinking akvavit , and take a look at Copenhagen . The center of the square is all one leafless park . Across it I can see some copper spires , and some castle towers , and narrow streets winding away from the square . All around Kongens Nytory crimson banners hang out the windows into the rain  --  some holiday , I assume  --  and a postman in a crimson coat is moving from door to door along the south side . Like the British , the Danes seem to have discovered the functions of crimson in a gray climate . Bells are bonging the hour of four from a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street wagon . I pour another two fingers of cold akvavit and pick up another piece of slimy herring . I never much liked herring , but this is suddenly delicious . It goes with the akvavit in one of those subtle food-and-drink marriages like octopus , feta cheese , and ouzo in Greece . It is a form of instantnaturalization . I am very glad to be here . Just now the door opened and a maid , evidently expecting an empty room , started in . I said something in English . A wave of red washed upward from her neck , a blush so dark it looked painful , and she scrambled out , falling over her own feet . New , probably , a country girl just learning to make beds and scrub bathtubs and bring in morning coffee . I ca n't avoid the feeling that she isp45just such a girl as my mother was when she first got up the courage  --  and what an act of courage it had to be  --  to spend her savings on a third-class ticket to America , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the village she came from  --  Bregninge , I do n't even know what island it 's on  --  but I 'm sure now I will . Tomorrow we will start negotiations for a car , and call on the rental agent whose name we got from the cherry grower on the Stockholm . We will get maps , guidebooks , phrase books . Ruth swears she will not try to learn Danish , but that does n't have to hinder me . Already I can say Ja tak and vaer sea god and en smuk pige , and I am getting pretty good at the glottal stop . On the corner , carpenters are working on the second floor of a building . I watch a boy , an apprentice he has to be , come from the street with bottles of beer spread fanwise between the fingers of both hands . Eight bottles , he carries . He disappears under the scaffolding , reappears after a while on the second floor . The carpenterslay down their tools and each takes a beer . They pass the opener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilt them to their mouths . They look like a bugle corps playing " To the Colors , " and I accept their salute . Velkommen , Onkel Yoe . I slapped the notebook shut . " That 's all for the night . I 'm gettingsinger 's nodules . " She did n't object . " All right . That was nice , We can read some more tomorrow night , and every night till we finish it . Unless it bothers you too much . " " It does n't bother me . " " I 'm afraid it does , " she said . " It bothers me , too . But do n't you think . . . I mean , this fits right in with the letters you 're going through . Here 's a whole piece of our life , a sort of strange interlude . " " Strange interlude is right . " I stood up , and I guess she saw me wince . " Hurt ? " " Just the old hinges . "  | " You should n't saw all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still you go on working as if you were a young man . You could hire somebody to do that hard work . " " And then what would I do ? " I said . I stood and listened to the rain hitting the windows in pattering gusts . " Minnie 'll be tracking in more dirt tomorrow than she sweeps out . " " Oh , my Lord , " Ruth said . " Tomorrow is Minnie 's day , I 'd forgotten . I meant to clear out that mess in the other bedroom . " My good wife is a cliche , the one who cleans up for the cleaninglady . And a good thing too , the cleaning lady being perceptiblyslapdash . The telephone rang again . Arching her eyebrows clear up into her bangs ( who 'd be calling at this hour , nearly ten o'clock ? ) , Ruth answered it . " Yes , " she said . " Just a moment , please . " Making don't-ask-me faces , she reached the instrument across . " Hello ? " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , false . " Mr. Allston ? I 'm terribly sorry to be bothering you at home , and so late . Do you have a minute ? You do n't know me , my name is Anne McElvenny , I live in San Franscisco and I 'm one of a group who act as hostesses and guides for State Department visitors . It 's a Junior League thing . I 'd like to ask you a favor , or a question . " " Ask away . Maybe I do n't have the answer , but I can try . " " I know ! It 's nervy of me , but I thought maybe this is something you 'd . . . and since he asked about you , and wondered if you were n't in the Bay Area . You know Cesare Rulli . " " Of course . Is he in town ? " " Yes . For the last two days . He leaves tomorrow night . And you know him , so I do n't have to tell you . He 's such a dynamo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had such a list I thought we 'd never get halfway through it , but . . . Well ! We 've done the City , and visited the bookstores , and had about six radio and TV interviews , and lunched with a lot of writers , and dined with the Italian consul  --  I 'm calling from there , so I can plan tomorrow . I know he 'd love to see you , if you 'll be at home . "  | " Why , yes , " I said . " We 'd love to see him , too , if we are n't tied up . Just a minute while I look at the calendar . " The routine again , hand over mouthpiece , mouth down , sotto voce explanation . " Cesare Rulli 's in town , somebody wants to bring him down . Could we give them lunch ? " People who have lived together a long time are said to begin to look alike . They also respond alike to anything that challenges their routine . I could see my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of hers . First the automatic impulse to reject the intrusion as a threat to peace  --  a sort of Why ca n't they leave us alone ? Then some rapid-eye-movement reconsiderations , neutral or only partly negative : what 's on hand ? have to shop ? rainy day ; everything will look its worst . On the other hand , Minnie'sday , that 's a plus . And a break in the daily round , good for Joe . And Cesare is good company , and it 's been a long time . " We could take them out somewhere , " I said . " No , we should have him here . I 'd like to see him , would n't you ? But I 'd hate to lose the whole afternoon . I 'd like to get in a walk if it clears up . Ask her if they could be here by twelve-thirty . " " Looks fine , " I said into the telephone . " Could you lunch with us ? About twelve-thirty ? " " Oh , that will be lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so pleased . But are you sure it 's not a ... " " Not a bit . We 'd be hurt if he did n't give us a chance at him . " " Oh , here he is now , just going by the door . Would you like to say hello ? " " Sure , put him on . " There he was , shouting in my ear . " Giuseppe ! Come va ? And what are you doing out here ? I looked for you in New York , and they told me , and I did n't believe it . I thought you owned New York . Cos ' e ' successo ? " " Cesare , " I said , " you ought to subscribe to Publisher 's Weekly . I retired and we moved out here eight years ago . " He still refused to believe it . Retired ? A giovane like me ? Now what was it , really ? Chased some girl out here , had I ?  |p48It  amuses Cesare to talk as if , every time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow Lollabrigidas and Lorens down alleys , and live the dolce vita with accommodating starlets , whereas in plain fact we have spent nearly every hour we ever had together sitting at a table at Downey 's , where Cesare will be most visible , conducting monologues with him as monologuist and me as monologuee , and consuming drinks for which , naturally and gracefully , he lets me pay . He always understood what agents are for , even though he was never more than briefly my client . I held the telephone four inches from my ear and let him shout for a while . When he lulled , I said , " Well , that 's great , it 's great to hear your voice . We 're delighted you called , and tickled you 're coming for lunch . I know you 're at a party now , so I wo n't hold onto you . We 'll spill it all tomorrow , shall we ? But better let me tell Ms. McElvenny how to get you here . " D'accordo . Va benissimo . A domani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put her back on , and I gave her directions . She could n't thank me enough . She knew it would make Mr. Rulli 's trip , just to see us . " Galloping sociability this week , " I said as I put the telephone back . " Is that so bad ? " Ruth said . " I thought you liked Cesare . " " No , it 's not bad , and I do like Cesare . I was just commenting on the way the calendar fills up . " " It 's just as well , " Ruth said . " You 're getting such an automatic way of evading people . I should think you 'd like seeing Cesare . He 's the liveliest person we know . He 'll come into our quiet little backwater like a waterspout , and stir us up . " " And that 's exactly what we need . " " What you need . " " And am perfectly happy to accept , " I said . " I 'll probably have more fun out of tomorrow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , " she said absently , already far ahead , already planning , forgetful of what she had started to say to me . " He 's such an amusing man . He loves himself so he makes you love him too.  |p49But  I hope they have sense enough to leave by three-thirty or so . Then Minnie can get us cleaned up before she goes . " In a couple of minutes she got out of bed . " Maybe I 'll just go and clear out that bedroom right now , " she said . " Then Minnie 'll have more time to . . . " Exit , murmuring and thinking ahead.  |p52Pazienza  . The day that started hectic ends morose . I sit here grumbling to myself , while Ruth recuperates with a couple of aspirins and a heating pad . My impulse is to damn Cesare , but he is not responsible , he was just being Cesare . If I ca n't handle the sort of challengethat Cesare makes to my chosen life , I had better choose another life . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " can be used to describe rain that is not vertical but horizontal , mixed with leaves , branches , power failures , and fears for the windows . We awoke to the shaking and shuddering of the house . Ruth took one look outside and began to mourn . Going to the kitchen to make coffee , I discovered en route that the clerestory windows above the bookcasewall in the living room were leaking , and I spent half an hour on the stepladder taking down kachina dolls , papier-macho Hindu gods , Hopi bowls , and other bric-a-brac from the drowned top shelf , sponging up a bowlful of water mixed with the cobwebs , dust , and dead flies that Minnie 's house cleaning had left up there , setting a row of breadpans to catch the continuing drip , and removing from the shelves and propping open to dry most of the lifework of Joyce Carol Oates , Edwin O'Connor , Eugene O'Neill , and Katherine Anne Porter . Then I got breakfast , which we ate as usual while listening to the " Today " show and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the day to entertain Italy 's greatest novelist , the profound anatomist of passion , true heir of D'Annunzio , with a dash c Cellini and a dollop of Casanova . Not the day to entertainanybody . As we set to work to prepare his welcome we alter/nated between anxiety that we might not be able to do right by him and a wan hope that he would n't come . We are fond of Cesare in spite of his books . His books are overrated , but that is because he is completely of his time , and his time overrates itself . He is neither the first nor the worst to make a career out of the verbal exploration of the various bodily orifices , genital , anal , and oral ( not the moral orifices , he is less interested in those ) . Maybe if I were younger , and my hormones more active , I might appreciate his novels more . As it is , I have to think them compulsive , theatrical , and decadent even while I find Cesare himself lively , amusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is as much of an effort for me to flog my flaggingsexual interest through one of his books as it perhaps was for him to flog himself through the writing of it . I suspect he much prefers the research to the writing . Nevertheless , in person he is engaging , the friendliest and best-natured of satyrs , far more fun than his books and far less repulsive than his audience . Though I grumbled a little about his coming , I was actually looking forward to it . News of the Rialto , and all that . It is possible to feel isolatedeven when you insist that that 's what you want - It is also possible to feel that you should justify your retirement by showing off the putting green and paddle tennis court . We used to do that sort of thing a lot . We had invented Eden , and owed it . a PR job . Probably we thought we were adapting to one of those illusions they call a life style . We wanted our Americanplenty to show , but not too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were simpler than our means would have permitted . We wanted to demonstrate that the rush to the suburbs and the country , when conducted by the right people , could be an enhancement of civilization , not an evasion of it . We had books , music , a garden , birds , country walks , friends . We were within ten minutes of a great university , with all it offered in intellectual and cultural weather , and less than an hour from the city that everybody in the world falls in love with . ' When we had Eastern or foreignvisitors we watched them confidently for signs of envy . Wep54wanted , maybe just a little desperately , to be thought terribly lucky . Well , we were , we are . But at our age , seven or eight years make a difference . Since coming out here we have lost a few friends by their moving away , and one very dear one by death . Eden with graves is no longer Eden . Moreover , we have had an invasion from the Land of Nod . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose upward mobility is always showing , whose new subdivisions scar the hills , and whose attitudes sometimesoffend the godly . So as the people we knew back East die , or are institutionalized , or take themselves off to Tucson or Sarasotaor Santa Barbara to estivate their last years away as we are doing here , our contacts here shrink , too . We have half given up the habit of mingling with our fellow man , and mingling , I suppose , is a little like sex . Use it or lose it . Like they say . Result : we find it easier to stay home and watch television , or read , than go out , and these days when we entertain visitors we find them less a pleasure than an anxiety . I get smitten with the desire to make garden and patio worthy of admiring exclamations ; Ruth cleans like Mrs. Craig and cooks as if Julia Child were coming to dine . We found ourselves preparing that way even for Cesare , who could make a desert island lively . Why ? I wonder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant time . Maybe something else , a determination to send him back to his crumbling old palazzo on the Botteghe Oscure crying aloud for the felicity he left behind in California . We were through breakfast by seven forty-five . By eight Ruth was in the kitchen with her glasses on and her cookbooks open , and I was out in the rain , doing my best not to blow away on every gust , trying to clean up the worst of the soggy leaves and trash that had eddied into the entrance . The plum blossoms of the night before were only a memory . This was no warm Hawaiianwind . This storm that had overtaken the first was straight down from the Aleutians . Streaming water off my slicker , my beret soaked , I brought in wood and laid a fire . With chicken breasts amandine for the mainp55course , I decided to evoke Cesare 's appreciation with a good Green Hungarian , and put two bottles in to chill . To give a runningstart to Minnie , who was due at nine , I emptied all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't show up by nine , I went in and made the bed . Then I cleared some coat space in the front hall closet , and when my householder 's eye was offendedby the clutter of canes , umbrellas , and walking shoes stacked in there , I cleaned out the closet . Nine-thirty , and no Minnie . Ruth , browning something in butter , compressed her lips and worked her black eyebrows at me significantly . " I thought maybe she could help with the cooking and serving , " she said . " If she does n't show up pretty soon she wo n't even have the house tidied up . " I started washing up her pots and pans , which she redirtied as fast as I washed them . By ten I had caught up with her , and the kitchen was filling with succulent smells , but still no Minnie . " She may not get here at all , " I said . " There may be mud slides , washouts , down trees , all sorts of things . Maybe I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work right away if she comes . " " Oh , if you would , " Ruth said gratefully . Reaching to move something off the burner , she burned her wrist . Grinning with pain , she held still while I smeared the inch-long burn with ointmentwhich I , suburban preparedness freak , had stowed in a drawer only days before . The more any situation looks to Ruth like darkest tragedy , the more I am inclined to believe it can be dealt with . My contrariness , I suppose . At that point I was hearty and cheerful , and though I had been preparing just as anxiously as she had , I wished , from my superior calm , to reassure her . " Take it easy , " I told her . " Cesare 's never been known for his promptness . If he gets here at all , and he might not , he 's sure to be late . There 's plenty of time . Just do your cooking , and relax , and I 'll go ahead and straighten up the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no guests , we 'll sit down together , just mep56and my Jo-John , and eat the chicken breasts amandine and drink a cold bottle of Green Hungarian together . " " I do n't know , " she said , and looked at me ( or herself ) and laughed . " If he does n't come now , after getting us started on this , he 'll never be welcome in my house again . " She had the lights on all over the house , to make things more cheerful that dark morning . I got out the vacuum cleaner and plugged it in and made one pass across the rug , and pop , the cleaner 's howl died and all the lights went out . " Oh , I knew it ! " came Ruth 's cri de coeur from the kitchen . " Peace , " I said , unruffled . " It 's probably just the circuit breaker . " Leaving the vacuum where it stood , I went and inspected the panel on the kitchen wall . While I was craning up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights flashed on , and the vacuumbegan to howl and flounder . I arrived just too late to keep it from bumping into the piano leg . As I shut it off and straightened it up Ruth came running , looking like Medea , and popped her finger in her mouth and rubbed it over the dented scar . The lights dimmed to a red pulse , flared up , and went out once more . Unlighted , the room was gray and cold . The wind went past the plate glass absolutely flat , and rain like tracer bullets swept the tops of the live oaks below the terrace . I could barely see the valley or the country road ; the hills opposite were only sodden , running outlines . " What 'll we do ? " Ruth said . " Have n't you got candles ? " " Oh , candles ! How 'm I going to cook ? How'lI we keep the house warm ? What 'll we do for water ? We ca n't even flush the john . " True . There are handicaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumped from a well , in a country where the winter ground is like soup , so that trees lie down across the power lines when the wind blows . Once last winter the power was off nearly all day , so long that Ruth and I paid three different calls ,  |p57to  people we did n't especially want to see , just to get to use a bathroom . On the other hand , I was still feeling cheerful and competent . These little emergencies stir the blood . I cope , therefore I am . " I 'll light the fireplace , " I said . " That 'll both warm and cheer us . Johns  --  I do n't know . What if I bring in some pails and kettlesfrom the tank so we do n't have to run down the pressure ? Keep one flush in each john for the visitors . As for cooking , what is Sterno for ? " " Did you ever try to bake corn fingers with Sterno ? " Ruth said . " Did you make an apricot souffle with Sterno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without corn fingers and apricot souffle . " " That would be quite a lunch . Chicken and salad . " " And wine . He 's eaten a damned sight worse . At least let 's see if we can keep the chicken warm . " I found two cans of Sterno , another fruit of my preparedness campaign , but no sign of the little tin stove to use them in . Ingenuitysuggested tipping up a burner on the electric stove , setting a can of Sterno in the well under it , and tipping the burner back flat . Presto . I was congratulating myself and trying to cheer my determinedly gloomy wife when the door blew open and Minnie stamped in , wet-footed , wet-coated , hoo-hooing like a steamboat , with a wet cigarette pasted to her lower lip . " Heyyyyy ! Ai n't this some 'm ! " Every Tuesday morning she arrives at our door bursting with some dramatic tidings . Like any boiler or pressure tank , she must be eased of her burden gradually . She ca n't be hurried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on such a day as this we know better than to interrupt her show . As when on some hot mountainroad a traveler hears the rumblings under the hood , and watches the temperature needle climb past the red and out of sight , and stops and opens the hood , and with handkerchief around hand makes darting stabs at the radiator cap to open it a little , but not too much , so the Allstons gave greetings to their cleaning lady , and waited for the jets of steam.  |p58She  kicked off her muddy shoes , she stripped off her raincoat and revealed the white nurse 's nylon that gives her status as a professional and imparts a touch of class to the establishments she is willing to assist . Rumbling with phlegmy laughter , squinting against imaginary smoke from the cigarette that had been quenched in her run from car to door , she slid in stocking feet to the kitchen wastebasket and with a wet thumb and finger dropped the disintegrating cigarette in among the garbage . " You know what I see on my way over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws 'll take care of that one ! " Them creeps are the junior executives and computer programmerswho occupy the new subdivisions . It is Minnie 's contention , with which in the main I agree , that they have ruined the hills by imposing their one-acre , one-house rigidities on land that used to be lived on comfortably by people who respected it . This morning , after waiting an hour while her husband Art dried out her wet distributor , she came over the hill past one of the new tracts just in time to see one of the bulldozed shelves let go its hold and slide smoothly down into the creek , leaving the aghast residents staring from the rain-swept edge of what had once been their front yard . " Fence , trees , part of the lawn , the whole business , " Minnie said . " I thought of callin ' Art , and then I thought , What the hell , let ' em apply to Town Hall . You know , Mister Allston , if it was you , or the Pattersons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute to help . Jeez , it use to be a lot different around here . Everybodyhelped everybody else , everybody went to the same Christmasand New Year parties , there was n't any difference except some people had a bigger house and maybe a couple horses in the pasture . And you knew people , you 'd see things goin ' on . Now everybody'sbehind a chain-link fence , you never see anybody even mowin ' his lawn . But you 'll see this guy for a while , you can look right in his parlor window . I wisht it would happen to the rest of them . Them creeps with their subdivisions and their tax hikes and their zoning ! My God , you ca n't even build a henhouse without a permit  --  ca n't even keep hens , for hell 's sake . Got to tie up your dog , ca n't do this , ca n't do that , ca n't keep horses because thep59neighbors object to all them flies . Then that same woman and her phony husband that have sunk all they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made too expensive for anybody to afford it , they go on down to Town Hall twice a month and pass some more laws so their fancy address wo n't get hurt by dogs and chickens and cluster housing and black people and Chicanos and students and hippies and **35;3256;TOOLONG , all one word . That 's their real scare . Honest to God , they cross themselves when they say it . " Ruth , with her unburned wrist holding up her bangs and her mouth in a rictus , said , " Yes . Well . " Minnie stowed her shoes and raincoat in the broom closet and stood up , grunting . " Might as well work in stocking feet , so 's I wo n't mess up your floors . God , them people . You know what one of ' em said to me the other day  --  Mrs. Barnes , you know her ? One of them white tennis dress ones with her legs naked clear to her behind ? Runs into me on the road and stops me to ask about Mr. Patterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look well , ' she says . Looks so pale and thin , ' she says . Well , ' I says , he 's just gettin ' over an operation . ' Is he gettin ' over it ? ' she wants to know . I heard it 's terminal , ' she says . I do n't know where you heard that , ' I says . Far as I know , he 's gettin ' along fine . " Well , I 'm so glad to hear it , ' she says , and then she says , like it has n't been on her mind all the time , Oh , Minnie , ' she says who the hell ever give her the right to call me by my first name ?  --  ' Minnie , ' she says , if anything should happen to Mister Patterson and they do n't need you no more , I hope you 'll keep me in mind . It 's so hard to find reliable help , ' she says , up here in the hills . ' Sittin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's callous , " Ruth said . " I ca n't imagine people being so callous . Minnie , I wonder ... " " Why do n't you try East Palo Alto ? ' I ask her , and she says , Oh , I would n't dare ! Bring a black into the hills ? ' she says . It would make me nervous , just knowin ' they knew where we live . ' Well , Mountain View or Sunnyvale then , ' I says . There 's plenty people need work . ' But she do n't like that any better . Chicanos ? '  |p60she  says . Right when La Raza is suin ' this town , right this very minute , tryin ' to push a lowcosthousingproject on us and break down our zoning ? I 'd be just every bit as nervous hirin ' a Chicano as I would a black . " Well , that 's too bad , ' I says to her , because you know what my last name is ? Garcia . ' That kind of scrambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she tries to say . I mean , you 're married to Mister Garcia but you 're not . . . And you live in the hills , you 're a neighbor . " So was a lot of other Chicanos till you crowded them out , ' I says . Oh boy , that 's some kind of people . Nixon could of got his whole White House staff out of just one subdivision around here . I wish you could of seen them up there on the edge of that bank lookin ' down to where their front yard had slid . " " I wish we had , " Ruth said firmly . " I wish we had time to hear all about it . But we just have n't got time , I 'm afraid . We 're in a jam , Minnie . We 've got people coming for lunch , and the power 's off . You know how that is . You ca n't do anything . But we 've got to , just the same . First thing , I guess you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the tank . " " Why sure , " Minnie said . " Why n't you say ? You just tell me what you need done . Oh . . . hey . " Her eyes were on me . " What ? " I said . " I forgot to tell you . But if you got company comin ' , your culvert'splugged up and there 's water runnin ' all down your road . I just barely made it up . " The light came on , dimmed to a glow , fluttered , and went out  --  some forlorn last kiss of broken wires off in the wet hills . Ruth said in her crisis voice , " I suppose you 've got to see what you can do . Minnie 'll get me the water . But first bring me in two leaves for the table . Oh , damn , why did n't we say we 'd take them out somewhere ? " " Maybe we could n't get out , " I said . " Maybe he ca n't get in . Relax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Ruth said . When she gets into one of those states she resents any attempt to soothe her . Only last-ditch desperation is permissible.  |p61That  was about eleven . Three quarters of an hour later I was still digging , blind with rain , my slicker threatening to lift me up like a hang glider , at the mound of leaves and gravel the floodwaterhad piled over the entrance to the culvert . Water pouring down against the pile was being deflected out into the road , to go sheeting down the asphalt toward the bottom , where a lake had covered the area between the eucalyptus trees . That culvert was obviously clogged too . My feet were wet , my pants were soaked to the thighs . As usual , my hands had gone into their Raynaud 's syndrome spasm in the cold and were white to the second joints of the fingers . For all that , the adobe mixed with leaves was so impossible to shovel that I finally had to get down and dig at the mass with my hands . Eventually I moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream of water dove downward with a slurp , and across the road I heard the plug of mud and leaves shoot out into the gully . So . Emergency dealt with . I cope , therefore I am . I washed my numb hands in muddy ice water and stood up to shove them between the buttons of my slicker and into my armpits for warming . Then I heard a car at the foot of the hill . It had already eased through the lake down there . Now , shifted down , it started fast up the road on which water was still sheeting , not yet cleared by my clearing of the culvert . It threw a bow wave like a power boat  --  a BMW , I saw , two people in it , blonde hair on the right , black behind the wheel , two faces staring out through the sweeping wiper blades . Cesare and company , a half hour early . Ruth would be so pleased . Leaning on my shovel , I stood aside , my face fixed for humorouscomment , intending to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would be with them in a few minutes . But at the last moment something in the set of Cesare 's head and neck told me that he was not pausing in any downpour on any flooded hill for any workman in a muddy slicker leaning on a muddy shovel . I just had time to swing around as they passed . The splash drenched the back of my slicker and the unprotected back of my neck.  |p62Almost  contemplatively , assuring myself that I still had a half hour before my guests were due , I went on down to the bottom and cleared the culvert there to ease and drain the lake . Leaving the shovel in case further emergencies developed , I came back up the road littered with leaves , broken branches , and rocks loosened from above . To maintain feelings appropriate to a host , I did not allow myself to dwell on the State Department 's **26;3293;TOOLONG , nor yet on the volatile and romantic Italian temperament . Instead , I counted the steps it took me from the bottom culvert to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle one to the top  --  one hundred seventy-one . Two hundred eighty-three altogether . Unseen , I got past the entrance and around to the bedroom door . But when I had peeled off my soaked and muddied clothes and stepped into the bathroom , my finger on the switch produced no light , and in the shower my turning of the knob gave rise to no more than a weak Iittle old man 's jet followed by a dribble . While I tried to get clean under that , I elaborated a fantasy in which I called Dr. Ben Alexander and had him come to examine the prostateof my plumbing system . Finally I got half clean , though my hands continued numb , and at twelve-forty , only ten minutes after they had been invited for , but forty after their arrival , I went in to my guests . Things had obviously been a little strained in there . Ruth , who has a lot of doomed-queen , avenger-queen expressions , sometimes Medea , sometimes Clytemnestra , sometimes Lady Macbeth , gave me one that was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just handing a drink , probably the second or third , to Cesare , who was peering out at the drowned hills and being reminded , not for the first time if my intuition was right , of Umbria . Cesare rushed to embrace me , crying to his gods that he had not recognized me on the hill . " How could I know ? I saw you there , I thought , Poor devil , what some people must do to live . ' But I could not stop , you understand , the road was a torrente . Or should I pretend that Ms. McElvenny was driving ? " I shook Ms. McElvenny 's hand : she was a pussycat with half/inch eyelashes . " I knew who was driving , " I said . " Remember the last time I saw you ? You drove me down that corkscrew road from the American Academy to Trastevere . I did n't draw a breath all the way down . Once I looked back , just as we passed that little temple , the one with the fountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Villa Aurelia 's gate . Then I looked down , and here came a Volkswagen bus that was going to meet us just at a curve where a fellow was washing his car in the road . And from farther down the roofs of the Regina Coeli were floating up toward us the way Fifth Avenue would float up at you if you did a half gainer off the Empire State . Nobody 's going to be in any doubt who 's driving , if you 're at the wheel . " Cesare was delighted . Said Ms. McElvenny the pussycat , " Can you picture what it 's like to have him drive you down Jones Street ? " " Yes , " I said . " Yes , I can . Exactly . " Ruth 's eyes were asking accusingly , Where were you ? Cesare was simultaneously exclaiming about the brutto tempo and asking how I was and demanding to know how I found myself out here on the West Coast . I got myself a drink and offered to refill Ms. McElvenny . " I 'm gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lights came on . Ruth breathed an excuse and darted for the kitchen . In the door she hung a moment . " Give me fifteen minutes ? " she said , and vanished . There we were . I inspected Ms. McElvenny . She was just the kind of pussycat that Cesare collects . In fact , she too put me in mind of the last time we were in Rome , when an American girl came to me wantingme to get her an advance on her manuscript and be a referencein her application for a Guggenheim . She said she worked so well in Rome that she simply must stay another year . She intimatedtwo or three times that she would do anything for the chance . I found myself unable to assist her as much as she wanted me to . Three days later I saw her at a table on the Via Veneto , smiling as any pussycat smiles who has just swallowed a bumblebee , while Italy 's Greatest Novelist poured out to her ,  |p64leaning  head to head across the cloth , his best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving me . Beside Cesare Rulli , Ben Alexander would seem taciturn . He has an interest in everything that moves ; only quiet things elude him . He can not sit still . Sitting , he hitches a chair around like a milking stool . Standing , he hops and strides around with his impetuous limp , gained , he says , from a German bullet when he was with the partisans during the war . I make no judgment on where he spent the war or how he got his limp . Maybe he borrowed it from Lord Byron and liked it so well he forgot to return it . He is a fly in a bottle , a June bug against a screen . Where anyone else would simmer , he boils ; where others boil , he erupts . He did n't dwell long on the brutto tempo or the view that is like Umbria . He was instantly off on San Francisco , which he has of course fallen in love with : a world city , a city more of Europe than America , a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city that knows how to play . Apparently he and his pussycat had seen it all , including two or three topless-bottomless joints in North Beach that they took in after the consul 's party . " This that you live in is beautiful , " he says with a sweeping gesture that makes Ms. McElvenny protect her sherry glass with both hands . " Bella , bella . Really , it is like Umbria . With cypresses it might be Tuscany . But I am curious , Giuseppe . Why do you live in the country ? Why not in San Francisco ? " I said we were close enough . When we needed the City , which was no oftener than once a month , we could be there in less than an hour . Mostly we went for nothing more spectacular than to see an exhibition at one of the galleries or museums , or to walk in Golden Gate Park . " Golden Gate Park ? " says Cesare to Ms. McElvenny . " Did we see that ? " " I did n't think it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. McElvenny . The glance he gave her was of such melting warmth and promiseand adoration that I expected I might out of pure discretionp65have to leave the room for a few minutes . " Avevi ragione , " Cesare said . " You were right . " He tipped his glass to drink , and I saw his eyes fix on something across the room . There were the breadpans I had set out on top of the bookcase wall . Below , overlooked in the rush , were the collected works of Oates , O'Connor , O'Neill , and Katherine Anne . He limped across to inspect them , and after a moment of contemptuous scrutiny limped back . " I did n't set them out to impress you with the competition , " I said . " I set them out because the rain had leaked in and got them wet . Your own are farther along the shelf , nice and dry . " He grunted , regarding me across his raised glass . " So you like it better in the country . What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud ? " " Lavoriamo in giardino , " I said . " Leggiamo . Meditiamo . Di quando in quando facciamo una passeggiata . " " Sei filosofo , " Cesare said . He studied me , tasting his drink with pursed lips , with the wincing , pleased , thoughtful expression of a horse drinking ice water . I half expected him to bob his nose in it . " Who are the literary people here ? Who is there to talk to ? " I said there were writers up and down the Peninsula , but no literarylife as he knew it , no taverns or pubs or sidewalk cafes where they gathered to talk shop and subvert each other 's wives and girl friends . Publishers and agents were all in New York . The local writers operated by mail , a fine economical system . Squinting in amusement , he called the pussycat 's attention to me with a jerk of shoulder and eyebrow . " Look at him . He was once a man of the , world , he had juice in him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty women , literary discussion . Now he sits on a cow pad and consults the grass . He pretendsto be on the shelf . Look , right over there is proof that on the shelf you can get all wet . You are not fair to your wife . She is an angel , I adore her , she should be out where things go on . She will look at you and grow dull , dull , dull ! Listen . I wish you had been with us in San Francisco . Come back with us tonight , I 'll stay over , we 'll see something besides Golden Gate Park . Youp66do n't want to sit in this imitation Umbria and dig in the mud and struggle against uncivilized nature . That is the way to grow old . " It was " Up at a Villa  --  Down in the City " all over again . Bangwhang-whangwent his drum , and tootle-de-tootle his fife . After I came in , he did n't once look outside again , though what was going on out there was spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lighted candles on the table , anticipatingfurther trouble from Pacific Gas and Electric  --  he proselytized me on life in the city square . As if I were a high school student , and not a bright one at that , he literally construed me the word " civilization , " and how it came from civis , and the word " urbanity , " and how it came from urbs , and he suggested that , being the man I was , I could not rusticate myself without doing harm to the civilized world . Since we were on that subject , one on which I have pondered , I reminded him of some other words : " arcadian , " which had its own pleasant connotations , and " civility , " which might once have characterized the civis but which seemed now to be forgotten there . I said if I had my choice I preferred to be suburbane . I said there were enough people around without my going hunting them . I preferred books . And as for pretty girls and amore , I quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybodyarrived at the point where he could not take yes for an answer . Miss Pussycat , sipping her barely touched sherry and keepingtrack of things behind her camel eyelashes , just about broke up over that one . But Cesare could not be diverted from his basic subject , women . He brought them to the table with him and developed them role by role : civilizes , comforters , handmaidens , houris , goddesses , objects of worship , homemakers , matriarchs . He made a speech worthy of an oil sheikh . Miss Pussycat watched and was fascinated , and likewise Minnie , stumbling around the table in her wiped-off but still wet shoes , bulging her white nylon as she thrust platters and bowls before people , her eyes on Cesare 's animated face and her thumb comfortably in the sauce . But after he had run through his set pieces , Cesare ratherp67tapered off . The plate that Minnie carried away from his place was only half cleaned . He drank his Green Hungarian without comment , almost impatiently . I had the distinct impression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him down en famille . Why were there no other people , why had no one been invited in to meet him ? Why , when we obviously were well enough off to choose , did we choose to eat like peasants in a kitchen , without the stimulation of guests ? Why had we not understood that a famous novelist appreciated a larger audience ? His eye once or twice wandered to Ms. McElvenny 's . He yeamed to be gone . At two-thirty she took her cue , stood up from the coffee tray in the living room , and said they ought to leave . It was such a terribleday , bad for driving , and they had appointments . How lovely of us to let her come down and kibitz on our reunion . On departure , Cesare embraced Ruth and then me , clapping my shouldersas if he were Anthony and I Enobarbas . When were we next coming to Rome ? We must absolutely let him know . We must be pulled out of our retirement and restored to civilization . And for today , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grazie . And arrivederci . And venga , venga a Roma . I held an umbrella over the two of them as we all ran for their car , and got myself wet all over again . As they grimaced and waved from behind their streaming windows and swashing wipers , I stood there like Little Boy Blue 's tin soldier , waving them off . When I came in , I was depressed and irritable , and I have been that way ever since . By working our heads off , we managed to give Cesare the dullest two and a half hours he has had since arriving in America . Any lunch in the City , anything from fog cutters and Indonesian sate at Trader Vic 's to a beer and a Polish sausage down at the Eagle , among the longshoremen by Pier 37 , would have pleased him more . It did not occur to him , so busy was he talking up women and civilization , to comment on Ruth 's food , which was better than anything he would have got in the City . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is so much better thanp68the sulphurous Frascati he is used to that he should never know peace in Rome again . Nothing we provided him , including the company , was anything but a bore . His monologues were wasted on an empty house . He pities me , I saw it in his face . One thing he did do  --  he impressed Minnie . " Ai n't he a skyrocket , though ? " she said as we gathered to clean up . " What is he , Eyetalian ? " " He 's a famous Italian novelist , " Ruth said tightly . She was squeezing a headache between her brows . " Some people , includinghimself , have mentioned him for the Nobel Prize . " " Is that so ? " Minnie said . " He talks like a writer , do n't he ? And do n't he like the ladies ! He never took his eye off his girl friend the whole time . Who 's she ? She do n't sound Eyetalian . " " Ms. McElvenny is a San Francisco girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Joe , " said my weary wife , " you do n't know a thing about it . " The hell I do n't . I know Cesare . Now here I sit looking out into the dripping live oak , with somberafternoon fading to gloomy dusk outside , the study chilly because I have n't had the ambition to build a fire in my little Norwegianstove , and my spirits as gloomy as the evening and as chilly as the room . God damn that Roman cricket with his nonstopmonologue and his pussycat and his civis and his urbs . He has managed to make me feel ten years older than I was yesterday  --  out of it , self-exiled , and without the courage of my convictions , without the grace to be content with what I chose . Tonight , unless Ruth 's headache alters the plan , I suppose I will have to read another installment of the journals of Joseph Allston , 1954 . I am not sure I like Ruth 's prescription any better than I like Cesare 's , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I have stopped , and am in need of r. pair . It irritates me to have people blowing out my gas line and testing my sparkplugs and feeling all over me for loose wires . I suppose Ruth thinks of me as that melancholy Half-Dane in need of comfortingand mothering ; maybe she also thinks of my life , which is also hers , as a sort of in-house soap opera . But mainly she yearnsp69over me and knows things that I should do to become her old nice funny Joe again . I ca n't see that Danish episode as an adventure , or a crisis survived , or a serious quest for anything definable . It was just another happening like today 's luncheon , something I got into and got out of . And it reminds me too much of how little life changes : how , without dramatic events or high resolves , without tragedy , without even pathos , a reasonably endowed , reasonably well-intentionedman can walk through the world 's great kitchen from end to end and arrive at the back door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after ? Lost health ? Lost content ? Misplaced identity ? Am I punishing myself ? As a form of suicide , Denmark does n't seem unpleasant , as a health resort it leaves room for improvement . Or maybe the Bertelsons were right in thinking me an ally . Maybe I do have this notion that the old country is simpler and better . But also , I knew before we came that it would probably be dull . Would I go back to live in the Middle West that I 'm always defending against New York snobbery ? Not for money . Yet here we are in Denmark , which you could n't tell from Indianaat fifty paces , and the puritan in me keeps wanting to rub my nose in it , and every now and then shivers with the exquisite pleasure of the hair shirt . Whether I 'm after simplicity or after punishment , observe the irony of the place we 've found to live in . The desk I am writing at is Empire , the drawing room I sit in is Louis Quinze . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen with swords , are either German barons related to the landlady 's family , or Kings of France  --  Louis the Bald and Charles the Fat or vice versa  --  also related but by the sinister route . They go with the apartment , rented ancestors . The whole situation is ridiculous . We havealways been private people , but here we are sharing the apartment of an indigent countess , and I did n't even put up a fight . One thing , it 's convenient : you can walk to any part of the old city in ten minutes . Another , it 's more attractive , by a factor of ten , than anything else we looked at . Another , it 's on the water  --  Havnegade means HarborStreet  --  and interesting things go on outside our windows . Three stories below , there is the street , then a cobbled quay , thenp71a narrow dead-end canal , then a long warehouse island , then the main canal linking the free port with the south harbor . Seagoing ships whistle for the Knippelsbro , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicycles and cars back up both sides . The ship 's funnels move with dignity behind a frieze of chimney pots and disappear beyond the Exchange building , above which twists up the green dragon's-tail spire that the Danes looted from the Swedes in some forgotten war . The cobbles shine in the wet like pewter , the moving cars shine , the slickered backs of pedestrians and bicyclists shine . Girls in belted raincoats pedal along with their rain-stung faces turned sideward , and boys on bicycles shoot the traffic as if they were canoeists in a rapid . Nevertheless , we must have been still doped with Dramamine to move in here . The countess retains the front studio-bedroom , we take the drawing room , dining room , and back bedroom . We share the kitchen and the one bath . At my time of life , bathroom lines ! Hurry up , Countess , I 'm in extremis . And one telephone for the two of us , in her room , naturally . Are we sorry for her because her husband ran out on her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now has to share the little she has left with strangers ? Maybe . Though she made her proposition with style . You 'd have thought she was suggesting a fascinating social experiment instead of making the best of her humiliation . Apart from the drawing room , the place is not even well furnished . The kitchen and bathroom primitive by American standards , the bedroom furnished in Early Goodwill . Bed I slept in last night a backbreaker , hollowed out by somebody with a most steatopygous behind . If it was once the bed of the countess ' husband , then he must be a man of very peculiar proportions . There will be more than backaches , I tell Ruth , but she thinks it will work . She and the countess liked each other on sight . " Is n't she lovely ! " the countess said to me when Ruth was looking out the window with the agent . " I love people to look like that ! " She says we will get along fine because we will be nice against one an/other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will be nice against her . Well , Barkis is willin ' . I have seen harder people to be nice against . The agent told us she was once one of the great beauties of Denmark , and so far as I can see , she still is , at forty or so . A husband who would run away from that should have his head carefully examined . But I do n't need a share of her troubles , which seem considerable and a little mysterious , and neither do I want every move we make to be complicated by the feeling that she must be asked along . Nor do I want her around the apartment all the time . I feel too lousy , and she does n't have a very good silencer . Right now she and Ruth are out getting acquainted with the neighborhood greengrocers and bakers and butchers . I ducked , partly because I 'm not feeling too well but also because I 'm holding back from getting too chummy . Like this morning , when I went out to get tickets for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I buy three . What does the countess do ? After a moment of surprise , almost of consternation , she accepts with pleasure . I have to learn to keep impulses like that under control . Now here they come down the quay under their umbrellas , each with a bulging string shopping bag . Jabber jabber jabber . A woman 's tongue , said the first American writer of any consequence , is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use . Their wet umbrellas lean together , their bags bump , they are so blinded by talk that they stumble on the paving stones . For Ruth 's sake I 'm glad . I made no preparations for Denmark ; I intend to look up no writers or publishers , even for social reasons . She ca n't have any great expectation of fun . A friend will help . Ruth is small , the countess five nine or ten , with a vivid face and fine clear skin . She would be statuesque except that she is so animated . An almost feverish eagerness possesses her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . Everything is so funny , or so wonderful , or so nice . Maybe the strain of speakingEnglish , in which she is fluent but not always correct , keeps her hyped up . Whatever it is , she could n't be more cordial if wep73had just come ashore on the desert island from which she had been sending up hopeless smoke signals for ten years . I have a good look at her from up here . She wears a kerchief on her head , but her heavy , smooth , dull gold hair is uncovered in front and gathered behind in a bun that looks as if it might weigh a kilo . Something in the way she moves . Is it breeding , or do they train them ? American women who have what is called " bearing " look as if they 'd learned it in model school and need a mirror for its constant reassurance . This one , in her tweed suit and sensible walking shoes and utilitarian raincoat , throws it away and still has it . But sometimes as earthy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the agent mentioned the havnefart , the harbor tour that periodically comes up the canal , the English implications of the word struck her and she giggled . And when we were sitting talking , later , she noticed Ruth 's shoes and cried out , " Oh , those tiny American feet ! " and in frank envy stuck out her own number eights for contrast . She has a smile that would melt glass . I watch them lean from the quay to inspect the plucked chickens held up by the man in the produce boat from Skagen moored at the dead end of the canal . They take one , then a slab of cheese , then six eggs that the Skagen man wraps individually in newspaper . The countess opens her purse . Ruth will not let her pay . Good . Rain dimples the still canal . The cobbles shine , the deck of the Skagen boat is dark wet . Up and down it from bow to stern and back again runs a splendid black poodle , intensely interested in the life four feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rail amidships says Hunden Bider  --  the dog bites . Ruth , of course , animallover and non-reader of Danish , reaches a hand across to pat him and is confronted by a raging mouthful of fangs . Hurt , she falls back , the countess volubly explaining . Really she is a handsomewoman , and a true Dane : her cheeks glow in the rain like shined apples . They pass out of sight below me . In three minutes they will be at the door.  |p74But  I will bet that shortly we will have tea and then a drink together . Even money they will take that chicken into the kitchen and make a shared dinner of it . It 's too wet and raw to go out , and can you see us letting her take her tray into her room , while we revel in the dining room over a poulet 1.66 and a bottle of Niersteiner natur ? And tomorrow , in spite of my feeble efforts not to fraternize too much , this woman who spent her youth adorning royal balls and being ogled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American friends , while thousands cheer . I am just enough of an American democrat to get a kick out of the idea . Who dat tall extinguished-lookin ' genman wid de testicleon his right eye , urinatin ' up an down de aisle wid de count-ess ? Later : As a prophet , I bat a thousand . We 've had a gay dinner . The countess is good company , a giggler , full of stories , and when she dresses up in something besides her tweed suit she could be a princess in a fairy tale by the brothers Grimm . She is related to every castle in Denmark and most of those in Sweden and North Germany . Her family 's estate is on Lolland , but she has spent a lot of time at Waldemarslot on the little island of Taasinge , and at a relative 's herregaard on Fyn , near Odense . She used to see a lot of the royal family because her father was Hofjaegermester , master of the hunt , and an important business of his Lolland castlewas growing hares , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's fall hunting parties . Another relative is Karen Blixen , who writes under the name of Isak Dinesen and who is the one person in Denmark I would like , out of sheer admiration , to meet . The countess says she will arrange it . Fraternizing like mad , we plan a lot of expeditions together as soon as our Rover arrives from England . See a lot of castles . I gather that this leftover aristocracy has about lost its function and has been losing its lands for decades . They all many their cousins for lack of anybody else suitable . Men mainly drunks , thep75countess suggests , and the women all witches . She herself has powers . Several times she has had second sight . She has a gift for quieting unruly or maddened horses , and once , while visiting relativesnear Kassel , in Germany , she cured a boy of warts . I learn from her how to skaal the lady on my left ; until she has been skaal'ed she is not supposed to touch her wine . Look the lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third vest button , raise it and drink , still holding her eyes , and then , still holding them , lower to the third vest button . It is an astonishingly intimate ritual . It taught me that I practically never look anybody that steadilyin the eyes , especially a good-looking , amused , and amusing woman . Coincidence department : Ruth mentioned that my mother came from Denmark . Oh , from where ? asked the countess . I said some village named Bregninge . Bregninge ? She said . Bregninge on Lolland ? Oh , how funny ! If it is that Bregninge , it is on our estate , where I grew up . Great , I said . That 's another expedition for us when the car comes . Want to go back to Lolland ? But a cloud has come over our dinner party . The countess does not get along with her brother , has n't seen him or written to him in years . It agitates her , obviously , even to talk about him . On the other hand his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the countess ' grandmother is still alive , nearly a hundred years old . What if she wrote to Manon , her brother Eigil 's wife , to see if she will invite us for luncheon or tea , so that the countess can see her grandmother and show us the castle , without running into her brother ? We could stay at the little inn in Bregninge , on the shore . Fine , sure . But notice one thing . The countess has a hundred stories , but none about herself , and she mentions every relative includingsome like her brother Eigil whom she wo n't speak to , but never her husband . And why have n't any of these rich castledwellersrescued her ? Why does she have to take in lodgers ? People 's private lives strike me as none of my business , and I have never developed the habit of fishing for them . I wait for the countess to volunteer something about her personal problems , butp76so far she has not . Does n't she trust us , after we have gone out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 ? 11 ? This journal is already getting spasmodic , though it 's the only halfway disciplined thing I do . Continue to feel lousy . Maybe , as Ruth keeps saying , I ought to take my ekg 's down to some Danish doctor to see if the heart infection is really gone , as they assured me in New York it was . Every now and then she looks at me hard and asks me if I 'm all right , and the mirror tells me I have a color like a two-week corpse . Nevertheless I rather enjoy the routines we are developing and the sense of being totally out of touch with everything known . Up about seven ( headache , backache ) , pick the milk and the countess ' yoghurt off the back stairs , put the ice sign in the kitchen window , shave , and go out the front door , noisily enough so that the countess will hear me and get her clear shot at the bathroom . The iron courtyard gates are already open . In the street the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning  --  dim dawn under the clouds . Up the quay the Bornholm boat is unloading . Yawning people , bicycles , suitcases . At the corner , plasterersare mixing mortar on a square of plywood . Soon the apprenticewill be sent for the first round of Tuborg gran or Carlsberg Hof . During the day he will go out seven or eight times . In the U.S.A. this would be called drinking on the job . At the bakery I take a number and stand in line with maids and housewives for brioches and snegle . Then back , carrying the warm fragrant sack through the thinning Bornholm crowd . The sun has burrowed into the overcast after one look at Denmark . A freighter comes up the canal , the Knippelsbro is rising , bicycles on the Amager side back up ten abreast . New and fresh . Maybe living on the East River would be a littlelike this , but there would n't be the smell of warm baked goods and the scaled sheen of cobbles , and Gristede 's would be no substitute for the clean little one-purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  bull 's head for butcher , pretzel for baker , and so on . We breakfast at the Empire desk by the front windows . When I laid the snegle down this morning and went into the kitchen to put the coffee on , I found the countess in her tweed suit  --  no robe-and-slippers sloppiness for her , even at seven-thirty  --  spooningbrown sugar onto a bowl of yoghurt . Her back was toward me ; somehow it looked depressed . I have hardly seen her since the night of the opera . That was Friday , this is Monday. " liar De sovet godt ? " I said . She whirled , her face sharp and startled . Then her thousandcandlepowersmile came on and lit up the gloomy kitchen . " You sounded so Danish ! " " The one-word Dane , " I said . " Et eneste ord . " " You see ! " Since our first meeting she has taken the position that I am a linguistic prodigy and learn Danish with miraculous speed . ( Danes in general are resigned to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgets that I heard it some in childhood , and she does n't know that in college I was made to study Anglo-Saxon , which is curiously close in some ways . Also , when I learn a word I do n't hide it under any bushel . " Et eneste ! " she said in admiration . " Already you are saying a thing like that which some would never learn . " Our eyes splintered against each other , or against some common unspoken embarrassment , and she edged by me , brilliantly smiling , with her tray . Almost persuasive , the smile glowed back down the hall at me through the closing crack of her door . I saw it as a shield turned to cover a retreat . A few days ago I was worried that we 'd have her in our hair more than we wanted to . Now I wonder if we 're to see her only in these strained , disappearing moments , like Emily Dickinson fleeing the sound of the door knocker . What has the woman done ? Why , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life , did not one soul speak to Astrid Wredel-Krarup in the theater the other night ? She ex/pected it , we expected it . I had some idiotic notion of a brilliant procession of old friends and acquaintances . I was braced for introductions . I suppose it was some such consideration that led us to dress up beyond the seats I 'd been able to get  --  the ladies in long dresses , me in black tie . Moreover , the seats in the front row ahead of us were unoccupied . We were as conspicuous as if we had been in a box . Nothing . Not a visitor , not a flutter of fingers , not a smile . Eyes , yes . Heads leaning to whisper , yes . We were watched in the ten minutes we sat there before the lights went down . We were watched at intermission ; and none of us wanted to get up and circulate . We were watched as we edged our way out with the crowd at the end , and I distinctly saw one couple note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't meet at the doors . The opera was that Honegger thing , Joan of Arc at the Stake , in which the female lead neither says nor sings a word , just stands tied to a post in the middle of the stage , waiting for the dawn and the fire . It opened with an ominous line : En hund hyler i natten  --  a dog howls in the night  --  and because I was uneasy about the chill we seemed to have created , and wanted to kid things back to normal , I leaned toward the countess and whispered , " Hey , I understood that ! " In the dusk her eyes were large and brilliant . It was almost like skaal'ing the lady on your left . But she was not smiling . She gave the back of my hand a little pat . " You understand everything , " she said . But the fact was , I never understood another mumbling word . I did n't understand the woman beside me , or the people I caught trying not to be seen looking our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understood what was going on on stage , where strange monsters out of some bestiary crept out of the woods and frolicked or mourned around Joan at her stake . Neither of the ladies wanted to go to the D'Angleterre for a bite and a drink after the show . We walked home , talking more animatedly than we felt about the opera , and when we were back at the apartment the countess very soon said her thanks and goodp79night and shut her door . For quite a while Ruth and I lay awake wondering what we had witnessed . Ruth had the impression that we had been stared at with hostility , simply because of the woman we were with . Mystery . The Danes are notably uncensorious , yet here is a woman whom all of Copenhagen cuts dead . We recollect that since we moved in with her nobody has rung her doorbell . April 13 : Our Rover is on the free port dock . I spent the day persuading six thousand three hundred and eighteen petty bureaucrats that I do n't intend to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the United States when we leave Denmark . And what is your business in Denmark , Mr. Allston ? Tourist ? Yes . And how long will you stay ? Three or four months ? Mmmm . The question stuck out of them in embossed letters : why ? I told one particularlynosy gentleman that I was writing a book about Danish democracy , and that corked him . April 17 : Two days lost to a raging migraine . I find myself thinking about the office . Homesick , the forsaken fire horse . This suspended life , this waiting for decent weather or for me to feel better , gets more tedious than I would have believed . A visit to one of the local specializedmedics ( a pleasant man , I must say , and a cultivated one , not just a mechanic who has studied medical Latin ) assures me that my ekg is indeed back to normal . Ca n't lay any blame on the ticker . So I develop a migraine . Cunning of me . The countess is our only drama . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than glimpses of her , because she had got a job doing some interior decorating and supervising the purchase of furniture and pictures for a French Embassy couple named La Derriere . She came out of her sober mood enough to giggle over that , and kept referring to them as Mrs. and Mrs. Behind . But mostly , when she has n't been out , she has been shut up in her studio , presumably sketching and working . It seems unnatural and unfriendly to keep so separate . We wonder if she is being scrupu/lous about intruding on us , or if she is avoiding us because of that night at the theater . This morning as we were having breakfast by the windows we heard her go down the hall to the kitchen and looked at each other . Should n't we ask her to join us ? But I  --  had barely pushed back my chair when her steps returned , positive and fast , and her door clicked shut . Such is our human complexity , we felt snubbed , at least I did . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news , most of which these days is about Senator McCarthy , a constant rebuke to our innocent assumption of American prestige in the world . After lunch Ruth drove us ( I was over the migraine , but feeling pale ) up to Dyrehaven to try out the Rover . Though the sun was out , it was chilly . No leaves 1yet , and no flowers except some tulips . I begin to understand the disbelief of Danish bureaucrats when I tell them we came of our own free will to live in this country for several months . We had come back and were having a cup of tea to warm up when the doorbell rang . Surprised looks , raised eyebrows . Thinkingthe countess must be out , I answered . There stood an elegant gentleman with his gray Homburg in one hand and his gloves in another . His head was baldish , but well brushed : the hat had creased the smooth fair hair above his ears . He had striking blue eyes , and the handsome regular features I will always associate with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wellrepairedbut unmistakable harelip . For a second I thought he must be some close relative of the countess ' , her brother maybe , and then I knew who he was . But he did n't know who I was . He was not prepared to see me . His eyes got hard , and popped a little , and he said something abrupt in Danish . " Excuse me , " I said . " Do you speak English ? " He did , perfectly , with a slight nasal cleft-palate whine . " Is n't this the apartment of the Grevinde Wredel-Krarup ? " " Yes , " I said . " My wife and I share it . I 'm not sure the countess is in. "  |p81But  she was in . Her door opened and she stood in it , stiff and smiling . Her visitor made a return smile . " God dag , Astrid . " " God dag , Erik . " Automatic as a traffic light , her smile turned on me . I doubt that she was aware of me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . I stepped back , she opened her door wider , the visitor went in , the door closed , and I shut the outside door and returned to Ruth and my cooling tea . She made her mouth soundlessly round . " Who ? " Just as soundlessly , I said , " Her husband . " " Oh-oh . " We sat on , uncomfortable because their voices were audible through the double doors that connected her studio with the drawing room . After only three or four minutes Ruth said , " We 'd better take a walk . " I said , " Ruthie , I 'm pooped , I do n't need a walk , " but we took a walk , up to the Nyhavn and back around through Kongens Nytorv . There we had a beer and a reje sandwich in a sidewalk cafe where only the infrared reflectors in the canopy kept us from freezing to death . When we judged it was safe , we shuddered back home . No voices . But we had hardly got our coats off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connecting door , and the countess ' bright voice said , " Are you busy ? May I come in ? " " I remember that evening , " Ruth said . Her hand went slowly and regularly down Catarrh from his nose to the end of his tail . Without opening his eyes he arched against the petting . A purr like a snore broke out of him and ended in a glottal stop . " It was when we first began to find out something about her . " " Yes , " I said . " But now that we know , do n't you find all this a little long-winded ? " " Oh no , no , no ! It brings it all back . It 's as if it were happening to somebody else . " " I sometimes get the feeling my whole life happened to somebody else . " Ruth said , " I think you only get that feeling because you don'tp82like to remember . You put things away and never look at them again . I want to hear every word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read through the whole thing like some schoolmaster doing his annual rereading of Dickens ? " " I thought that 's what we were going to do . " Rain like sand pattered at the window . I heard the clogged downspout by the door overflowing a heavy stream onto the bricks . I would have to get the leaves out of that before the next rain . " You want your pound of flesh , " I said . " Oh , Joe ! " " I told you , this is n't going to give either of us much pleasure . " " I did n't think that was the purpose . " " No ? " I said . " What was the purpose ? " But after a second or two in which we looked at each other with that baffled , stubborn expression that people who have been a long time married often wear when they are reading each other 's minds , I started reading again . My problem was the opposite of what I said it was . In our relationship with Astrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , I was n't quite spectator enough . She sat down but would n't take a drink . She was at once more statuesque and more nervous than usual . She could n't keep her hands still . Finally , with a little laugh , she took one in the other and stopped its jittering , and holding them so , manacling herself , she lifted her shoulders and said , " You saw my husband . " " I did n't know , " I said . " I thought he might be . " " I have not seen him since many months . He has not lived here since the day the war ended . Now he asks to come back . " After a cautious interval , Ruth said , " And what do you think ? " She provoked a surprisingly fierce response . " Think ? In such matters I do not think . I do not live in my head . I live down here . " She slapped her hand melodramatically against her belt , or below it . " Ever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . " I smiled , Ruth frowned , the countess had no idea what she had said . " You do n't feel you want him back , " Ruth said.  |p83The  countess bent her head , heavy with smooth hair , and pondered . Then she raised her face , made an apologetic smile , and said , " I am feeling many things at once . Excuse me , please . I know I should not bring this to you , it is nothing of yours . But I could not  --  sit in there any longer . " Ruth 's pleasant opaque look said to me that I 'd better get out and let the women deal with this , but the countess read the look as clearly as I did . She reached a hand as if to hold me in my chair . " No , please . " We sat uncomfortably , liking her , sympatheticwith her in her troubles , as humanly curious as the next couple , and not quite sure she could be trusted . Ruth was murmuringthat of course she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know about him , of course , " the countess said . She drew a blank . " You mean that he 's left you ? " Ruth said . " Oh , that was only the finish ! Someone must have told you that he was a quisling . " If anybody had told us that , it would have explained a great deal , but who would have ? She was the only person in Copenhagen we knew . " At the opera , you could not help seeing , " the countess said . " It was an embarrassing for you , I am sorry . I should not have tried . But I thought , maybe because I was with you . And I had not been out like that , to the theater , since before the war ended . " I figured on my mental fingers . " Really ? That 's nine years . " " Yes . " A shrug . " The cinema only , where it is dark and no one has a face . " Not quite intending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , steady , and serious . She had a look as patient as sculpture . Up till then I had never seen her unprotected by the smile and the excessiveanimation . But , my God , nine years . " I wish you to know , " she said , sitting straight in the gilded French chair . " During the Occupation , German officers came here  --  relatives , cousins of some degree . I suppose they thought , because of Erik ? I do n't know . Possibly they were bored and lonely in a country where they were hated and avoided . Perhaps their mothers had told them to call , or being gentlemen , theyp84thought they understood what was correct . They understood nothing . I said to them , I am a Dane , I love my country . Put on other clothes and I will receive you for your family 's sake , but in that uniform I will not let you in . ' " " But your husband did let them in . " " Not here . I did never know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborating , giving informations , spying . Once somethingmade me think Goering had bought him . " " Goering ? " I said . " Why ? How ? " " Because he tried to buy me . In Kassel , where we have relatives . We are all related , there is some Schimmelman and Knuth in all of us a generation or two back . I had to go to Germany for an operationon my knee . He came to my hospital room . I never asked him to sit down , he understood that much , he was standing the whole time . It was not spying he wanted , only to be accepted . That swine . If more of us would act like Erik , he said , and say in public that the Germans were behaving very well . It was the first time I was sure that Erik had been what at home they were saying he was . I was furious . I planned to get a gun and murder that fat Goering if he came to me again . " She stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face . " Oh , I did , " she said . " I got the gun . I have it still . But he never came back . Only that once , to tell me how generous the Germans were prepared to be if we would accept them . They did n't want to have to be harsh . You have heard how on the first day of the invasion they ran down the flag before the royal palace , and the King with his own hands ran it up again . They left it there , it flew throughout the war . They wanted our good will . Erik 's they had . He hated the socialist Danish government that squeezed the landed families , and he was educated in Germany . He was always bitter , and he caught the Nazi disease . " With two fingers she touched her upper lip . " You saw that he ... " " Yes . " " When he was a little boy his mother would never kiss him.  |p85She  would not let him walk beside her . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She hated it that he was marked . " " Ugh , " Ruth said . " No wonder he was bitter . " " But that would n't necessarily make him pro-German , " I said . " Ah , if I understood why ! Most of us hated the Germans , the longer the war went on the more we hated them . We were ashamed that the Danes did n't fight , as the Norwegians did . Later , when the underground was organized , there were explosions , and sabotage , and shootings , and we were glad . Many peopletried to get away to Sweden in small boats , or across the ice one winter when the Oresund froze . Some were caught and shot . People like Erik were blamed . I have been spitted on , can you believe that ? Twice the partisans tried to kill Erik . The second time , only a day or two before the war finally ended , they shot him down on the steps of the D'Angleterre . Only the police who were there saved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . First he went to the hospital and then he went to prison . Two years . " She pronounced the terminal s the way my mother used to , as if its sound were really s , not z  --  a sharp , hissing , unpleasant sound . Two yearss . Trying to imagine what her life had been during that time , I was thinking that two years from the end of the war brought us only to 1947 . What about the other seven years since the German army broke up along the Schleswig-Holstein border ? But the countess was still pouring . " They took Erik 's estate on Falster and even my place at Hornback , that was not his but mine . They left me only this apartment and my little cottage at Ellebacken . I did not like it that my husband was a quisling , but he was my husband , what should I do ? I sold my silver , my dishings , many pictures , furnitures , all things , to pay his fine . From prison he wrote me pitiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over and over to government offices . Some people told me I should be in prison too . I went to relatives who might have influence , they did n't dare do anything . I went to the King , I said we would leave the country . But those in power did not want Erik out of the country . They wanted him where hisp86punishment would be plain . When they had , insisted on that long enough , they let him go . " She seemed to have finished . " Then did he come back ? " Ruth prompted . Sidelong flash of eyes . " I thought he would not be able to find work . I said I would support us with my designs . While he was in prison I lived by making designs for prints and wallpaper for Illums Bolighus  --  I had a friend there who would not tell who made them . But , . you know , they released Erik and he came here for his clothes and went straight away with that woman he met during the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidarity . As for me , I was uncomfortable . It always embarrasses me to have people confess or pour out their troubles . I never know what to say . I always feel a little like the man who fixed cats for a living , and who was asked why he filled his shopwindow with clocks . What would you put in the window ? I left it empty . " So ! " the countess said . " Now . Now he would come back . Something has happened with his woman , I do n't know  --  she has gone to someone else , or he has tired of her . He says it is I who have been his wife all along . He was not pleased that I did not ask him to move straight in . How could I , even if I wanted to ? You are here . " " But my goodness ! " Ruth said . " If you 'd like us to make room , you only have to ... " " Oh no , no , no , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child . He shouted , you must have heard . He says I am not loyal , I have no sympathy for his suffering . " " We did n't hear anything , " Ruth said . " We were out for a walk . " Just then I thought of something to put in the window . " Would you like that drink now ? " Brilliant suggestion . The countess turned on her smile and it stayed on . Her angry flush faded away . Her humiliating story told , she was back to her old gaiety and animation . She reminds me in some ways of Ginger Gilbert , a girl I used to know in the begin/ning of the twenties , a game one , sassy , the original peppy date . If I should say , " Handsprings , anyone ? " I have the feeling she would cartwheel around the room . That aspect of her goes oddly with the statuesque bearing and the unmistakable stigmata of breeding . " Yes ! " she said . " Pleass ! A strong one ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she and Ruth were just parting from a sisterly hug . I handed the countess her drink . " Vaer saa god . " " Tak ! " She took the glass with her left hand , and with an impulsive , whole-bodied gesture she leaned against me and squeezed her right arm around my waist . She surprised me . " You are both so good ! " she cried . " Oh , I am so glad you came here ! It is so lovely to have friends ! " To keep the tableau from getting too corny I assumed a most rigtig stance , with the glass at the third vest button , and skaal'ed her , gazing deep , deep into her peerless eyes.  |p88I  closed the notebook and laid it aside and went to the closet for my pajamas . Ruth did not protest . She lay petting Catarrh , watching his hair lift with static . I was buttoning the pajama coat when she said , " It 's funny , you keep speaking of her as the countess . ' " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , I do n't go around calling the nobility by their first names . I 'm like Minnie . Their status is what impresses me , not their names . That Eyetalian . The countess . " " I called her by her first name after the first day or so . " " Well , I did n't , after two or three months . Ever . She called me Mr. Allston and I gave her back the full business . When I tried Danish , I did n't Du her , I De-ed her . " " Yes . " She handed me the limp cat . " Here , Catarrh had better go out . Put him out the front so he can get to the flower bed without getting wet . " I carried him to the front door and set him out in the entry surrounded by the drip and splash of rain . He stood with his back humped and then made a bolt to get back in , but I blocked him with my foot . " Go on and do your business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come in the cat door even if you do have to wet your feet . Do n't stand around the bedroom door yowling . " He looked up at me as if he hated my guts . His eyes were as blue as Erik Wredel-Krarup 's , and his lip was cleft . I shut the door on him . In the bedroom Ruth had turned off the bed light and settled down . I snapped off the reading lamp by the chair and stood in the dark listening to the uninterrupted rain . Then I crawled into bed and put my arm around Ruth , soft and familiar , and withoutp89turning she laid her hand on my hand and squeezed . " Thanks , darling . " " Hvorfor ? " I said , bemused by what we have been remembering , and oddly dim in the sight from looking down some roads not taken . There is a feeling part of us that does not grow old at all . If we could peel off the callus , and wanted to , there we would be , untouched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind to consequence , a set of twitches as beyond control as an adolescent 's erections . It is this feeling creature that Ruth keeps wistfully trying to expose in me . To have me admit to yearnings and anguishes , even if they threatened her , would allow her to forgive and pity me , and since she has trouble getting me to hold still for outward affection , forgiveness and pity are not unimportant . If she can do that small thing , after years of failing to make me over into what she wishes I were , she can devote herselfunselfishly to me without fear that she is pounding sand down a rathole . Catching me with my feelings showing would give her power over me as surely as if she had collected my nail parings and tufts of my hair . - ' Is this unjust ? Obviously . In protecting myself against circumstances , or against myself , I pretend to protect myself against her . ' What I felt while reading that diary , and what I somehow ca n't tell her or talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much is changed , since 1954 . I really am getting old . It comes as a shock to realize that I am just killing time till time gets around to killing me . It is not arthritis and the other ailments . Ben exaggeratesthose . It is just the general comprehension that nothing is building , everything is running down , there are no more chances for improvement . One of these days the pump will quit , or the sugar in the gas tank will kill the engine in a puff of smelly smoke , or the pipes will burst , or the long-undernourished brain will begin to show signs of its starvation . I do n't suppose Ruth would bear my senility any more happily than my death , and I certainly do n't wish for her the job I have seen some wives saddled with , the care of a shuffling invalid , ap90vegetable whose time has come , whose tie is always smeared and whose zipper is always unzipped and who is always mistaking the PG &E; man , come to read the meter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother who has been in his grave for forty years . What the countess has come to , actually . The trouble is that the feelings do not die . I remember Ruth when we brought her and her baby home from the hospital , her fine bones , her small wracked healing body , the tightness of her arms around my neck in the bed made suddenly roomier by the eviction of that intruder between us . And I remember my gurgling son , fat and broad-faced , happy despitea full diaper , and how he laughed and reached out his hands when I played at knocking him over with a pillow . I remember too much . I remember a futile life . Yet if I turn away from it and die , Ruth loses her lifework all at once . If I only lose my buttons , she can go on managing me , sadly but with the satisfaction of love , duty , and selflessness . It is something women get for being durable . I do n't envy them . I have put away a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can guarantee that when the time comes he will have the wit to take them , or even remember where he hid them . Ben Alexander , with his pacemaker , has an advantage that he brags of . He has only to disconnect a wire , or so he says . He ca n't be betrayed by senility and forgetfulness , as I can , for when life is on a jack like a telephonethere is a good chance that accident will sooner or later disconnectit even if forethought fails to . The end is the same : not even a dial tone . I suppose I had no real chance , once I had let her know that j the journal existed , of not reading it to Ruth , or at least letting her read it . She is an exorcist at heart . She believes in cleansings and purifications , and she has a dangerous theory of complete honesty in marriage . When we had been married no more than twelve hours , she told me she had made a vow never to go to sleep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our eyes . Since my impulse is to close my eyes on the quarrel and sleep it off , our systems have not always meshed . What often happens is that I back down in order to avoid all that soul searching that she likes ,  |p91thereby  committing some dishonesties she is unaware of . I doubt that she could ever believe that a man who resists her managementand does not tell her all he knows can really love her as she wants to be loved and as I am sure she loves me . Yet I do . She is the woman I share the world with , and I can imagine wanting to share it with no one else . I could hand her these notebooks and tell her to read them herself , but then I refuse the marital communion her soul craves . If I burn the things and declare that I will not be henpecked into spilling guts I no longer acknowledge , then I burn into her a conviction that certain aspects of the Danish episode were more important than in fact they were  --  that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Denmark was only one of those queer little adventuresthat the life-tourist runs into  --  a circus where you saw a man crawl through a ten-inch pipe , a side show where the fat lady 's stuffing came out , a trapeze act where the acrobat flinched and refused a jump he knew would kill him . No , Denmark did no more than thicken the callus . It was something I survived . Left to myself , I would deal with it ( I tell myself ) as Catarrh deals with his leavings in the flower bed.  |p94Ruth  strikes a lot of people as a cute lively little lady , bright , cultivated , interested in people , a good listener and a chatterbox of a talker . Some of them overlook the Presbyterian missionary in her , some of them fail to see the Salvation Army lass , most of them have never seen the shrew . They all know the warmth and sympathyshe feels for all sorts of human misfortune or cussedness , but even Ben Alexander , until he had acted as her doctor for a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds her together and threatens to warp her out of shape . And nobody but me knows the little girl of about six who is buried in her , as ineradicable as the uneasy adolescent who is buried in me . Tell me a story , Daddy . Tell about when you were a teenager of fifty . Tell about Denmark , where you were so sad . She was already in bed , without a book , waiting , when I came into the bedroom after turning down the thermostats and switching off the lights . The storm had blown itself out in the afternoon , but the clogged downspout was still dripping through whatever clogged it , and big regular drops thunked against the turned tin at the bottom . She had me go out and stuff a washclothinto the spout to kill the noise , and when I came in she was all business . " Well , " she said . " Where were we ? " A good question . I got into the chair and opened up the second notebook and found where we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a bum diarist , " I said . " There 's nothing here for ten pages but quotationsfrom the wise men . " " Read them . Is n't it important to know what you were thinking about ? " " Is it ? It looks pretty gloomy from here . " " Still . "  | " All right . Here 's Thucydides : Having done what men could , they suffered what men must . ' " She said doubtfully , " I guess I do n't . . . " " Having lived as long as they could , they died . Having fought as long as they could , they were killed . We should all have it engravedon our tombstones . Maybe you 'll like this one better . Thisis from Marcus Aurelius : " And as for thy life , consider what it is ; a wind ; not one constantwind neither , but every moment of an hour let out , and sucked in again . . . . And also what it is to die , and how if a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and separate from it in his mind all those things which with it usually represent themselves unto us , he can conceive it no otherwise , than as a work of nature , and he that fears any work of nature is a very child . . . . What art thou ; that better and divine part excepted , but as Epictetus said well , a wretched soul , appointed to carry a carcass up and down ? " I flipped the page and glanced up . Ruth was staring at me , frowning . " Why would you write down something as morbid asthat ? " " What 's morbid about it ? " I said . " It is n't very cheerful , maybe , but it 's wisdom . I suppose it struck me because I was a littletired of carrying the carcass up and down . " She continued to stare at me for what seemed a long time  --  four or five heartbeats , I suppose . Then she folded back the covers and jumped out of bed and wrapped her arms around my head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruthie , " I said when she eased up and let me breathe . " I did n't know you were that . . . I thought you were just tiredout ! " " Well , I survived . " I pulled her down in my lap and we had alittle cuddle . The cheek I kissed was wet . " Oh , now , come on , " I said . " You ought to tell me more ! " " I wonder . Look what even a hint does to you . " " But when I think of the difference it might have made ! " " Yes , " I said . " It might have made you so anxious about me  |p96you  'd have driven me off the Knippelsbro . Now why do n't you hop back into bed before you get cold . " The fact was , I had pulled her down on me when I was kinked , and my knee was twisted and my hip ready to pop out of joint . If she had been sorry for me another minute she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , me , the complexity of being married to a woman you dearly love and automatically resist . I inevitably evade her management . I even evade her sympathy and affection , or meet them with my guard up . Martial is the anagram for marital . The grapple is everything , and I do n't mean the sex grapple that so obsesses the seventies . That is only the signature for something much more complicated . " All right , that 's better , " I said when she was back under the covers . " Ready for more gloomy wisdom ? " " I guess . " " Here 's something from Kazantzakis : When a Greek travels through Greece , his journey becomes converted . . . into a laborioussearch to find his duty . ' " " That 's you , for sure . " " Duty ? Me ? I follow pleasures and grails and lines of least re-sistance . " " Like fun . I never saw anybody so set on finding his duty as you .

So here 's another one from Kazantzakis : Never return to success ; return to failure . ' And still another one : Cursed be he whose thirst is quenched . ' " " I like those a lot better than Marcus Aurelius , " Ruth said . " They 're more like you , for one thing . " " Never disparage Marcus Aurelius , " I said . " Did you know he was one of the earliest environmentalists ? You could quote him to the Sierra Club . Here he says , That which is not good for the beehive can not be good for the bee , ' and under that , in Allston'sp97crabbed hand , is written , The world suffers from an increment of excrement , ' which you might render into the vernacular as The world is full of shit .

" " What were you doing , making notes on everything in Penguin Books ? " " Looking for the house key . Want to skip the rest ? " " All right . I get the idea . " I flipped pages until I came to solid scribbling again . " So . There 's been a gap . It 's now May 13 . The Allstons have just returned from a ten-day automobile trip to escape the Danish rain . They have driven ( in the rain ) through Hamburg and Hannover , with one splendid evening in a wine cellar in Celle . They have circumnavigatedthe East German border and traversed ( in the rain ) the Romantic Road through towns named Dinkelsbuhl and Rothenburg , with mottoes and scriptures on their gables and Riemenschneider altarpieces in their churches . They have driven ( in the rain ) through a lot of blossoming apple trees to Innsbruck , where the Inn was full . Remember that green glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lilacs and horse chestnuts blown off by a storm ? Remember the Munich company that was singing Cosi Fan Tutte in the opera house ? Then back ( in the rain ) through the Rhine-Mosel country , a fine experience because 1953 had been one of the best vintage years in history , and even the dollar-a-liter grocery store wine was marvelous . And so back to Copenhagen ( in the rain ) with the Rover 's boot full of smuggled wine to beat the Danish taxes , and the old lady quaking all the way for fear they 'd be thrown in jail . We rejoin them in the apartment on I-Iavnegade , in the company of their interesting but troubled friend the Countess Astrid Wredel-Krarup , abandoned wife of the celebrated quisling . " " Idiot , " Ruth said . " Read . " " Cursed be he whose thirst is quenched , " I said.  |p98May  13 , Havnegade 13 : Hugs and kisses for Ruth , none for me this time , when we get back . It is surprising how much it feels like coming home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists should be as important in anyone 's life as we seem to be in the countess ' . The poor damned woman has probably not talked to anybody but tradesmen and Mr. and Mrs. Behind since we left . And that 's the condition she 's been in for nearly nine years . Why does n't she emigrate ? One thing she 's done . She 's been in touch with her sister-in-law back at the old castle , and we 're invited down on May 2o . Her wicked brother will not be at home  --  a shame , I 'd like to see what real wickedness looks like . We will stay in the castle , which will give Ruthie a thrill . As for me , I will be able to take my mauve face into Bregninge village , if this turns out to be the right Bregninge(there 's one on Taasinge , too , and maybe others in other places ) , and see it reflected in the window of a thatched cottage . Maybe that will exorcise my yearning for visits to the ethnic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take Ruth down to Italy , where she 'd like to be , where the food is good and the wine is cheap , and exchange my hair shirt for something more seasonable . May 16 : Two mornings now we 've got the countess to bring in her yoghurt and join us at breakfast . This morning , as we sat looking out at the harbor , it struck us all that the light was singularly bright , that there was not a cloud visible , and that the cheeks of bicyclists waiting for the Knippelsbro were pink with sun , not purplewith rainy cold . " We have to go somewhere ! " Ruth said.  |p99Denmark  was all before us , where to choose . The countess said , hesitating , " Would you like to see my little Ellebacken cottage ? We could carry a picnic . If it is really warm we can swim  --  it is on the shore . And oh ! " She is an atom under constant bombardment , no thought goes by without knocking off an oh . " Oh , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Rungstedlund , on the way . Shall I telephone ? " Ruth said automatically , " How does she feel . . . I mean about your husband , and ... " " We have that in common , " the countess said a little grimly . " In Africa , in the first war , her husband sympathized with the Germans . " When she is excited she has an extraordinarily vivid face . She jumped up and went into her room , leaving the door open . After a couple of minutes , exclamations , questions , chirps began to blow through the open door like straw from in front of a fan . I understood two words of it : fa and farvel . Blazing with pleasure , she came back . " Oh , it works so right ! She asks us to take our picnic in her garden . She will give us the first strawberries out of her mistbaenkhowdo you say ? Hotbed ? Do you not think she is a great writer ? And she will like you because you are both so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you to her ! " She stopped , looking at my face . " But is it too much ? Are you well enough ? " I said I felt fine , which was only a medium-gray lie . About ten , with the top down , we pulled out of the courtyard into a miraculously soft , warm , windless day . A few clouds as soft as cats had crept in to sit around the horizon , but they did not stir , just sat . The 0sterbrogade was bumper to bumper with cars and bicycles . Weekday , workday , be damned . Father Rain had left town , and all of Copenhagen was headed for the beaches , shedding clothes as it went . The Irish priests who Christianized this country , and the Lutherans who undertook the maintenance contract , never had much effect . Danes on a sunny day are unreconstructed pagans headed for a festival  --  May Day , I suppose , delayed a couple of weeks by wet grounds.  |p100Cars  with Swedish plates , full of roaring young people , kept coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play chicken . Cursing , I took to the ditches and woods and gave them the road . The sun always brought them , the countess said . Comingfrom prohibition country , they started getting drunk on the Halsingborg  --  Helsingor ferry . By the time they had been in Copenhagen an hour , they would be overturning launches on the havnef art , and the Danish women would have to carry clubs . Those Swedes , they are so rigtig , but when they have drunk some things they will follow you right up your own stairs . The sun shone on us , the soft air flowed over us , the Oresund was very blue . I said , " A couple of days of this , and I might throw away my crutches and follow you myself . " She is not prim . She gave me something like a leer . " Ah , it would not do if you were to get feeling too well ! " Impenetrable smile from Ruth . " Oh , impenetrable ! " Ruth said . " What is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says in the book , " I said . " My glaciers began retreatingand you were jealous , a little . Or so I evidently thought . " " So you thought . All right , go on . " We were out of the worst traffic . Suburbs , gardened houses , glimpses of sea : the Danish Riviera . The countess was telling about how they used to sail here , before the war . Then down the Oresund came a white ship , standing only a little way out from shore . " Is n't that . . . " Ruth said . " Yes , it is ! It 's the Stockholm ! " We could see passengers crowding the rail in the sun , watching Denmark flow past . They had it so much better than we had had it , limping seasickly in through the rain two days late , that I gave them a certain Italian gesture . " Anathema , " I said . " The Yankee curse on all of you . " The countess affected to be hurt that I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Anathema , " I said . " A bunch of damned Swedes . " We were all silly with sun . Then we came to a stretch of beechwoods , and the light changed . Everything went palely green and gold . Between the smooth gray trunks the grass was starred with white anemones or hepaticas . The leaves passing over our heads were tiny , delicate , tender as pale green flowers , a tinted mist that in a couple of days would be a green roof . Fairies must have been invented in a spring beechwood . The ladies exclaimed and fell silent . At the far edge I made a quick U-turn and came back through . We rolled slowly with our heads tipped back , and at the edge turned again and came through a third time . Druidical magic . Ruth , looking a little trembly , said , " I never knew you to do a thing like that before . That was lovely . " The countess too . " Mr. Allston is not the way Americans are supposed to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insensitive ? Why does he not think all things can be bought for money ? Why does he respond to beautiful things ? Why is he so nice ? " " Nice " is her nicest word . It is a fine thing to be admired by two attractive women on a spring day , with the top down . I felt like boxing my ankles . Shucks , girls , it was nothing . Velkommen , countess . Glad to do it . A little farther on she directed me in a drive toward a house covered with ivy . " Karen said she would be in the garden , " she said , and led us around past a glassed-in porch with light sunny colors and wicker furniture . Outside , big overhanging trees , just leafing out . Tulip beds , about gone by . Lilacs darkly budded but not yet quite popped into flower . At the back of the garden a thatched cottage with a squat chimney , and on the chimney a stork 's nest . A woman in a floppy hat stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trowel in one hand and a stone or clod in the other . She was small and thin . It was impossible to imagine this little creature leaving a dinner party to go out and shoot a couple of lions prowling the yard , or assisting at Kikuyu childbirths , orp102doctoring the great bloody wounds of Masai warriors , though I knew from Out of Africa that she had done those things and more . She was brown-faced and brown-handed , as if Kenya had permanently altered her Danish skin . Though she was smiling , no teeth showed in her smile : she merely bent her lips . Her eyes were dark , alive , and noticing . She stood very still . Witch , for sure . Shape-shifter . If you held a mirror behind her it would reflect not a little brown woman but a monkey , one of those ambiguous oldwomanmonkeys of her tales , or perhaps a still bird with a curved bill . We were hardly introduced before , with the air of disclosing a delicious secret , she opened her hand and showed us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a flattened cylinder of stone six inches long , marked with the crooked letters of a dead alptabet . Just as she showed it to us , the stork came back to its nest with a sun-darkening spread of wings . Karen Blixen glanced up . " Ah , old friend . " They were two of a kind , as beady-eyed and as capable of stillness . Knew each other in Africa , no doubt , and in a lot of sabbaticaldoings . I looked for the broomstick , but the stork had hiddenit among the nest twigs as she flew in . Picnic on the grass . By witchcraft or otherwise , Karen Blixen produced the only salad we have had in Denmark that was n't composed of hothouse cucumbers . Also a very eucharist of strawberriesout of her hotbed . Her talk was all of Africa . Listening to her bring it to life , monumentally primitive and powerful . I remembered the passage in Out of Africa in which a line of elephantsemerges one by one out of the mist , as if being created before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said to her . She gave me a dark , alert look . Her cheeks were wrinkled in fine parallel lines . She appeared to have no cheekbones at all , and her eyes looked too big for her face . A bird 's face , really . For the first time I became aware that she must be nearly seventy . " It was life , " she said . I made a motion that included the hedged , protected , breeze/less garden and the old chimneyed house in its overcoat of ivy : inherited country place , probably complete with all the lost loves , crimes , and whispers from the past that she has written into her stories . " And what 's this , then ? " I asked . " This ? This is safety . " I had the nerve to argue with her . " Is it bad to have a place to come back to ? " I said . " An American , or at least one kind of American , would envy you . His parents or grandparents were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has lived in fifty houses in fifteen places . When he moves , he does n't move back , he moves on . No accumulations . No traditions . A civilization without attics . " " Or rubbish piles , " said Karen Blixen . " Or dungeons . Or ghosts . " " Or rune stones . " She continued to regard me with her dark eyes , interested . " You feel this . " As if anxious to explain me , the countess said , " You know , Karen , Mr. Allston 's mother was Danish  --  from Bregninge , can you imagine ? We go there next week , all three of us , to see if that is his safe place . " She had taken off her scarf , and the sun was on her smooth hair . If Karen Blixen was a witch , the countess was a Lorelei , and not unclairvoyant herself . I had never s'id anything to her about why I had an impulse to see my mother 's village . My safe place ? Karen Blixen said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then ? " " He will not be there . It is a chance to see Grandmama and Manon . " " Eigil is his father 's son , is n't that the trouble ? " I thought the countess flushed a little , but she looked back steadily into Karen Blixen 's look until the look was withdrawn . The old woman sat ruminating on the rune stone . It was remarkablehow witchlike , how malicious and gleeful , her face could be . Click , went Ruth 's camera . I hope she caught that expression.  | " I hope you 'll forgive me , " she said in confusion . " I could n't resist . " " I do n't mind , " the old woman said . To me she said , " It 's too bad you do n't know Eigil R  --  dding . There is an accumulation , if you like accumulations . There is a house with an attic . " Not sure whether she was baiting the countess or simply makingconversation , I thought I might turn the subject aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where would you have got your marvelous Gothic tales ? " " Of course . But you are not writing stories , I take it . " " No . " " You expect some revelation ? You think you may recognize something ? You expect that closing a link with your mother 's past will make you feel safer in some way ? " " I 'm not so compulsive about it as we 're making it sound . I 'm just sort of curious . " " You do n't expect to reverse your mother 's emigration and come back to Denmark to live ? " " Oh no . " " Why not ? " She caught me out . I said honestly , " I guess I 'd find it too small and tame . " When she smiled widely , her wrinkled cheeks puckered up into pleats of brown skin . Under the floppy hat her eyes looked black , without pupils . " But very safe , " she said . " Denmark is full of retiredsea captains growing roses . It is full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bregninge like that . That whole estate uses the past to create the future . Astrid 's father was a man of great talent , and her brother has inherited a good deal of it . " She glanced at the countess with affectionate malice . " I leave Astrid out of it . Her talents are different from theirs . " " Karen , please , it is not funny , " the countess said . " The old count was the Doctor Faustus of genetics , " Karen Blixen said . " Trees , flowers , hybrid fruits like those of your AmericanBurbank . Also game and hunting dogs and much else . It was said of him that if he needed dogs with long legs and webbed feetp105for running in swamps , he could start with a pair of dachshunds and in a little while produce you hounds as tall as giraffes , with feet like paddles . It is good that Eigil has inherited his father 's gifts , because some of the experiments involved species that do not breed quickly like mice or guinea pigs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a genetic experiment with elephants , say ? It is not quite like fruit flies . " The countess had grown obviously sullen ; she did not like this talk about her father and brother at all . Karen Blixen studied her , lightly smiling , her expression about fifty-fifty malice and affection . " Astrid is sensitive about some of this science , and she can tell good from evil , she thinks  --  that is one gift her brother lacks . As I grow older I wonder who is right . I do know one thing . Evil , if it exists , is not all lumpy and ugly like a toad . It is often more attractive than what people call good . Eigil disgusts his sister because he follows their father 's practice of seducing peasant girls . It is naughty of him , surely . But is it evil ? Who would say that for sure except a virtuous sister ? The fact is , Eigil could not be uninterestingif he tried . If you were to meet him , you might find him fascinating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be at home when we call . " The witch woman was rubbing the rune stone along the side of her nose the way I have seen pipe smokers polish the bowls of their pipes . Abstractedly she studied the childish scratches of the runes . Quick as mice , her eyes darted to the countess , who was sulky , and to me , who was uncomfortable . " Your mother was from Bregninge . Tell me about her . " " Nothing much to tell . She was an orphan . She lived with a peasant family and did farm work  --  thinned sugar beets and cleaned cow byres and so on . " " How old when she emigrated ? " " Sixteen . " Raised eyebrows . " That young . Why ? " " I do n't know . It was n't in character for her to do such a thing . She was n't really adventurous . When I 'd ask her , she 'd put me off . Said she just wanted to see something new . "  | " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh no , I 'm sure not . " " But she was running away . " " I used to wonder if she was n't . She would never say . " " From the old count , do you suppose ? " Now there was a thought . " Karen , " the countess said furiously , " this is simply unkind ! " " My dear , look on it as a story , " her cousin said . To me she said , " It pains Astrid to hear these things spoken of , but they are part of a story , and stories are part of the accumulation you think will tell you something . Stories last better than the people who lived them . Hamlet is only a tattered shadow up here in Helsingor , but on Shakespeare 's pages he is immortal . Now . What I am saying is n't as fantastic as it sounds . Sixteen-year-old Danish peasant girls do n't run off to America for nothing , and she lived on the estate of a man famous for chasing peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran away , and escaped , there is not much of a story . I would turn it around if I were writing it . Suppose she did n't have the courage or the money to do what your mother did . Suppose she was trapped , or suppose even that she found the old count irresistible  --  and why would n't she ? Suppose she did n't quite escape , or escaped only after she had been seduced and was pregnant . Then you , though born in America , would come back here hunting for your safe place , as Astrid says , and find that you were Astrid 's half brother , and a sort of cousin to me . It takes only a little twisting to make your return take on possibilities and become part of a Gothic tale . " " I give it to you . " She nodded , holding the rune stone to her cheek and smiling the smile that showed no teeth . " For Astrid 's sake I will decline it . She has always been terrified that I will write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , " I said . " I was n't born until four years after my mother landed in America . There goes my only hope of a distinguished pedigree . " The countess stood up , and as she did so , the stork left its nestp107and flapped off low over the tops of the trees . We watched it go . " Well ! " said the countess with her brilliant smile . " If we are to go on to Ellebacken we must begin . " Karen Blixen did n't try to keep us . But she held my eyes a moment , her smart wrinkled face like the smiling face of a Greek kouros , and said , " If you find it possible , come and see me again after you have been to orebyslot . I am curious to know what a returningpilgrim would find . " We had driven all the way to Helsingor and beyond , and were looking through the Ellebacken cottage and throwing open windowsto air the musty house , and wondering if the sound was warm enough for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a place that expresses her  --  ten acres or so of wood and pasture , a clearing of unmown grass , a walk guarded by cypresses , a half-timbered thatched cottage as picturesque as something in a drawing . As a matter of fact , I had seen it in a drawing , one of hers . This was the place , apparently , where she and her husband used to be closest and happiest . She said he liked to play at mowingthe grass and chopping wood , like the Kaiser at Doorn . Before the war , they spent many weekends here . Since her life blew up , she has managed to come only two or three times a year . She offered us the use of the place , an offer which I took to be a transparenthope that we will come and bring her with us . A swim in the sound , very chilly . But a new side to the countess . For one thing , when reduced to a bathing suit she is more seductive than I would ever have guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of disguise . For another thing , she was not kidding when she said she lives in her body , not in her head . She frolicked in that ice water like some Valkyrie , and she swam out until her head disappeared in the chop of little waves . She could have swum to Sweden , I suppose . As for me , I got blue and goose-pimpled and had to come out . So of course Ruth and the countess worried about me , and built up a fire in the fireplace , and made tea , and clucked over me like a pair of over-healthy hens.  |p108Long  past time to quit this . Very , very late . A long time ago I heard all the clocks in Copenhagen strike two , each making its own guess . It took the hour about fifteen minutes to ricochet from the Raadhus tower to the last lost church steeple out on Amager . Ruth sleeps in the other bed like a tired dog , and here I sit in my backbreaking oriole 's nest , wide awake in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take another one soon , I may get three or four hours of sleep . This day , though the most interesting we have spent in Denmark , has been too long . I have a beaut of a sunburn  --  nose , skull , forearms , back of the neck  --  but it 's nothing to some of the cases we saw on the way home , when fifty thousand Danes were retreatingthrough a red sunset in complete disorder , a Dunkirk . Notice : just thinking the word " beach , " I think disaster . ' When I should be sleeping , I am dragged back to that grubby van in that dusty arroyo near La Jolla where Curt lived with his silly surfboardand his dreary girl in his raffish community of streak-haired mind-blown demigods and demigoddesses , disciples of sun and kicks . Intent upon what ? Rebellions ? Repudiations ? Apathies ? Boredoms ? Fears , panics , terrors ? Or just on Now , on the galvanic twitches of the eternal pointless present ? What is that life style ( that jargon term ) except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is what troubles me . Curt 's repudiations let the air out of my confidence that I know what my job , my principles , my vote , my admirations , my friends , and my marriage are all about . I am as unsure of myself as I ever was of him . And I know why . In rejecting me he destroyed my compass , he pulled my plug , he drained me . He was the continuity my life and effort were spent to establish . I have been guilty of making first Ruth and then Curtis into barricades behind which I could take shelter . But why could n't he have understood the hunger and , love and panic , the trembling and the cold sweats and the sleeplessness , the times when I looked at him sleeping , as a child , and was overwhelmed by my responsibility to him and his dearness to me ? Who broke it , he or I ? Fell or let go ? Did he eventually bore himself with thep109aimlessness to which , maybe , my anxious demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big a wave , and if so why ? To show me something ? Christ , even in my regret I ca n't leave him alone . It is a pitful , grubby little story any way you read it . The saga of an immigrant family , a succession of orphans , that began in flight on the island of Lolland in 1901 and ended fifty-two years later ( in flight ? ) on the beach at La Jolla , on the western or suicideedge of the New World . Fifty-two years from wooden shoes and hope to barefoot kicks , fear , and silence ; and in between , Joseph Allston , the bright overachiever , his mother 's joy and treasure , his son 's alien overseer . Safety , Karen Blixen says in scorn . She resents rusting unburnishedwhen she wants to shine in use . She pretends to think her life in words , which has made her an international figure , is meagerer than the life of action she once lived . Nevertheless she came home in the end . Echoes of the turtle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her back . Safety is a legitimate human desire  --  is n't it ?  --  and home , says old wise man Robert Frost , is where , when you have to go there , they have to take you in . Safety is a mutual matter . Do I hate the thought of Curt 's death more because he never fulfilled himself , or more because he never fulfilled me ? Did he know how gladly we would have opened our door , how carefully we would have avoided making his return a humiliation of his pride ? And do I know for sure that I could have been wise and open ? Do I think right now that I could have kept my temper and my tongue ? Which is deeper , a father 's love or a disappointed father 's contempt ? The Danes have a name for the energy and ambition that they ridicule in the Americans and fear in the Germans . Albuer , elbows . They call our overgrown cars , with their toothy chrome grilles , Dollargrins . Of course they speak from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a put-down of what is more powerful than they . I wonder if it was an underdog world , a small-power world where little could be expected of him , that Curt was hunting when he spent a summer here inp110Copenhagen a few years ago ? Or was it only the tales of how compliant the Danish girls are that drew him ? Why did he live in a furnished room on the Nyhavn , supposed to be the roughest waterfront in Europe ? Was he hunting safety in that cave , a place where he fitted in ? Who is the waif and orphan here ? And do I really think there is something reassuring I might find in this mousehole of a country ? What should a little Kafka animal do ? Hide in the hole and hear the Enemy digging toward him , or run out of the hole into the fearful open ? What did the Europeans gain by Columbus ? The illusion of freedom , I suppose . But did they gain or lose when they gave up the tentative safety of countries and cultures where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had been tailored to the dangers , and went raiding in a virgin continent that was neither country nor culture , and is n't yet , and may never be , and yet has never given up the dangerous illusion of infinite possibility ? What good did it all do , if we end in confusion and purposelessness on the far Pacific shore of America , or come creepingback to our origins looking for something we have lost and ca n't name ? No sooner do I ask that than I have to admit that what brought my mother and a lot of others to the New World was precisely the hope of safety , not any lust for freedom . What do I want , a drawbridge between the continents , across which the culturesand hence the generations can meet , and pass , and meet again ? The fact is , I do n't know what I want , or should ever have wanted , and I do n't ever expect to know . What I would settle for right now is the ability to fall asleep.  |p111That  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read right through the breast-beating part , instead of skipping it as I had done the night before , and I think I did so because I wanted Ruth to listen to it , I felt the compulsion to declare myself unmistakably , no matter how it troubled her , no matter how it troubled me . For a while after I stopped , we sat there . She turned her face toward me , her serious , still pretty face with its pert unfaded eyebrowsunder the white hair . She is as lucky in her skin , which does n't wrinkle , as she is in her figure , which has n't changed two pounds ' worth in forty years . She is one of those whom old college friends would recognize at once ; I am not . We looked at one another , and then she looked down and picked absently at a knot in the mohair throw that covered her . With her eyes on the knot she said , " Youle newer got . overit . " " No , I guess not . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . I loved him , too , I thought I could n't bear it when he died . But I have . It 's the only way . It 's not healthy to go on grieving forever .

If you can finally bear it , all that proves is that you 're a born survivor and I 'm not . " " What do you mean by that ? " " I do n't know . Nothing . Maybe just that women are more durable , they 're made for surviving and holding things together . Anyway it 's not his death , or not only his death . "  | " What then ? Do you still feel guilty about all the clashes you had ? " " That , sure . I do n't suppose I 'll ever get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow . But that 's not all of it , either . " " Then what ? " She is ever one to talk it out . What ? Good God , what not ? But it was I who had provoked this dialogue . " The way the world wags , " I said . " The difference between what we 'd like to be and what we 're able to be . How to respect myself when I know I 'm confused and cowardly . How to respect a world where nothing I believe in is valued . How to live and grow old inside a head I 'm contemptuous of , in a culture I despise . " " You must n't , " Ruth said , ready to cry . " Even if it was as bad as you say , you have to go on living , and you ca n't blame either yourself or him just for the way things are . He agreed with you , do n't you know that ? He despised it , and himself too , as much as ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me I 'm not to blame for anything . The hell of it is , I despised his way of despising it more than I despised it . If he 'd really fought against the things he hated , some way or other , do you think I would n't have been with him ? But he just quit . He turned belly up . And he was on the side of the future , his way won . In twenty years everything he stood for has taken over . He was prophetic . The counterculture . The pleasure principle . Now . Wow . Junk everything good along with the bad . History is an explodedscience , civility is a dirty word , self-restraint is not only unhealthy , it 's a laugh . Manners are hypocrisy , responsibility means you 've sold out , adolescence lasts into the seventies , or will . And it 's okay to lush on the money civilization so long as you hate it . So then the money civilization gets the word and adjusts itself to the new market and sells itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He 'd have come around . " " I wish I thought so .

" " Sometimes fifty-one per cent does n't seem quite enough . Also- , l sometimes it 's all you should take . My problem with Curt was that he wanted to take eighty-five per cent while keeping his right to gripe . It does n't do any good to pretend that he did n't lush . He never learned the responsibility of giving something in exchange for what he took . If I come down out of the hills with foxtails in my beard , crying , Woe , woe unto this people !

" " I think so , " Ruth said . " I have to think so . " " Maybe you 're right , " I said  --  I just dropped it , I did n't want any more of it . I stood up , and found that I was so stiff I almost could n't stand . My toes , ankles , knees , hips , ground bone against bone . My finger joints were sore and hot to the touch as I casually washed them in air . Ruth watched me until I went to the bathroom , where out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She watched me in silence as I went through the bedroom on my way to the kitchen to get a glass of milk to counteract the corrosiveness of the painkiller . I came back , and she watched me in silence as I undressed . I went to bed gloomy.  |p116Today  , among other junk mail , there was a questionnaire from some research outfit , addressed apparently to a sampling of senior citizens and wishing to know intimate things about my self-esteem . It is their hypothesis that a decline in self-esteem is responsiblefor many of the overt symptoms of aging . God knows where they got my name . Ben Alexander , maybe ; his finger is in all those pies , and always stirring . I looked at some of the questions and threw the thing in the fireplace . Another of those **26;3321;TOOLONG studies suitable for computerizing conclusions already known to anyone over fifty . Who was ever in any doubt that the self-esteem of the elderlydeclines in this society which indicates in every possible way that it does not value the old in the slightest , finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evades their problems , isolates them in hospitals and Sunshine Cities , and generally ignores them except when soliciting their votes or ripping off their handbags and their Social Security checks ? And which has a chilling capacity to look straight at them and never see them . The poor old senior citizen has two choices , assuming he is well enough off to have any choices at all . He can retire from that hostile culture to the shore of some shuffleboard court in a balmy climate , or he can shrink in his self-esteem and gradually become the cipher he is constantly reminded he is . What bothered me about Cesare Rulli 's visit if not the lacerationsit left on my self-esteem ? The responses that I feel more and more when we step out into the unsafe surrounding world are doubled and tripled every time we go down to the Stanford campus , as we did yesterday afternoon to hear the Guarneri Quartet . Inside the hall , all'sp117well . Music is a great democratizer . There are as many white and gray heads in the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of appreciation , you see a few people you know , you are smiled and waved at , you feel the solidarity of common tastes and interests you have spent your life acquiring , and you participate , even though an outsider , in the community of the university . But go outside after the concert and you step out of security into hazard , out of the culture into the counterculture . All around the terrace the young roam , or sprawl , or lounge . White Plaza has a sort of bazaar , a stretch of blankets and quilts and plasticgroundcloths on which are displayed belts , handbags , macrame flowerpot hangers , and other kinds of the junk that Gertrude Stein called " ugly things all made by hand . " The wives , children , and dogs of the artists tend them and sleep among them . Studentspour back and forth , or sit arguing at the union 's tables , or read propped against trees . They are not hostile and contemptuousas they were a few years ago ; they just do n't see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sit down at it , or pull in their legs if you fall over them . They do n't seem offended that you exist , only surprised . It is unsafe to approach a swinging door too close behind one of them . If you get there first , and pause to hold it open for them , they bolt on through with an alert , sidelong , surprised look , both puzzled and offended , as if your act of courtesy had been a trap they had just managed to evade . In the plaza and along the walks , their ten-speed bicycles come up behind you silently and swiftly , and without bell or warning whiz by you within two feet at twenty miles an hour , leaving you with a cold shock of adrenalin in your guts and a weakness in your knees , and in your head a vision of your humiliated old carcass lying on the pavement , pants torn , knees bloody , arms broken , glasses smashed . You wonder if they 'd notice you then . " What do you expect ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 've got their own concerns , why should they notice you or me ? Do you expect them to whisper to each other , Who 's that distinguished-looking couple that just went by ? ' Dop118you think they should stand aside and pull their forelocks at you ? " " Oh , for Christ 's sake , " I said . " It 's just your vanity . " " Okay , it 's just my vanity . The fact remains that every time I come into this plaza I feel self-conscious , and uneasy , and like a freak  --  an ignored freak . And I resent being- made to feel like a freak by a bunch of real freaks , self-made . " " I wish you were n't so prejudiced , " she said hopelessly . " It would do you good to have more contact with young people . You need it even more than they do . " " Yes ? " I said . " How do you make these contacts ? It was n't the old who declared that feud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet if you 'd just accept one of those invitations to talk to classes you 'd find out there is n't any feud at all . That destructive phase is all past , everybody keeps telling us . It went out with Vietnam . These are just healthy normal kids going about their business in a place where they have every right to feel at home and you and I do n't . " " They obviously do and I obviously do n't , " I said . " Come on , let 's get out of here and take our walk . " " It might be good for you , " Ruth said . Maybe good for me , but not comfortable . That spell of muckingout my culvert in the rain just about fixed me . I limped and hobbled  --  maybe exaggerating just a little for Ruth 's benefit , to emphasize my legitimacy as an oldster . Her response was not sympathetic , though I thought I detected doubt in her glances now and then , and caught her just about ready to ask if I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , in spite of the rheumatiz . We walked all around the hill where the older faculty houses are , and all the way , in the big opulent yards , the mimosa made yellow globes among the other trees  --  pure forsythia-yellow , the true color of spring  --  and there were whiffs of daphne , and manure , and mushroom compost , and the pleasant sight of gardeners working . The briskness of the air got us to walking faster than I reallyp119wanted to . I wanted to saunter and savor , because this was clearly not the country of the young , this was civilization of a pleasant and reassuring kind , the kind I have been trying to earn citizenship in ever since I was old enough to know what I wanted . We rounded the hill and came down along Frenchman 's Creek , running a steady little stream after the rains , and pooling above old weirs . There we overtook Bruce and Rosie Bliven , bundled up in overcoats and armed with canes and walking with brittle briskness . They have lived on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic many years ago . Since retiring , he has had about three heart attacks and written about five books , and it is a cinch that at eighty-five or whatever he is he still contemplates five books more , and may be halfway through the next one . His last Christmas letter contained a line that should be engraved above every geriatric door . He says that when asked if he feels like an old man he replies that he does not , he feels like a young man with something the matter with him . He has a sweet humorous face and an innocent resilience that make me ashamed of myself . As an apologist for old age he is better than Ben Alexander , even . And Rosie can make you feel good at a hundred yards , just by the sight of her . Bruce says she is always trying to help old ladies of sixty down steps . We chatted awhile under the pepper trees and parted , and they went back up along the creek with their canes , talking as if they had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on . " Are n't they a cute pair , " Ruth said . I thought I detected a monitory tone . " Mellowed by age , " I said . " Oh , come on ! " she said impatiently . " You can admire them without getting off on the young again . " " Brace yourself , " I said . " Here come a couple . " They came toward us arm in arm , the girl sashaying out and swinging her long skirts as if in a square dance , and turning to look up into her companion 's mat of whiskers with a teasing sortp120of adoration . As we came close they both looked at us directly , and smiled , and said softly , " Hello . " Startled , we replied . They passed on . Ruth was ready to pop with self-righteousness . " What about the surly young ? " she said . " How about that feud ? " But I defused her with a reasonable response . " That 's all it takes , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They noticed us , they were civil , they appeared to be closely related to the human species . God bless them , if they 'll act human they can wear all the granny dresses and whiskers their little hearts desire . " " All you need is one pretty girl to speak to you , or one boy to act respectful , and you melt . " " Was she pretty ? In that getup , who could tell ? But okay , you 're absolutely right . I 'm a pushover . Just let them beware of undermining my self-esteem , that 's all . Now how about heading home ? I 'm cold , and my toe joints are killing me . " " Ah , poor lamb , I 've walked you too far . " She took my arm , perhaps remembering the way the girl had swung on the elbow of her boy friend . " But do n't you like this ? Do n't you like walking down here where something is going on and there 's more to see than leaves to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd talk to a class , if they ask you again . I might even try to audit something , if they 'd let me . " " The innocence of age , " I said . " If you were black , sure . Since you 're female , fine . If you were blind , deaf , crippled , absolutely . But if you 're old , you 're up against discrimination that does n't even know it 's discrimination . You 'd just better stay out of it . " " Oh pooh . At least I do n't go around with a chip on my shoul-der . " " Speaking of which , " I said , " did you ever see anybody put a chip on his shoulder and dare somebody else to knock it off ? Where do we get cliches like that ? Tom Sawyer or some place , I suppose . Maybe once , down in some Mississippi woodyard , somebodymade his dare like that , and forever after we have no way to express challenge but that stupid metaphor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tirade about what 's wrongp121with the world . Ca n't we just finish our walk in peace , and enjoy it , and maybe come down again ? Will you ? With or without a chip on your shoulder ? " " Sure , why not ? So long as we stay away from that plaza . " " All right , let 's do it , " she said . She was being bright and chatty and unchallenging , and she hung onto my arm . " What 's in tonight'sinstallment of the journal ? " " I do n't know . I guess the ancestral castle of Oreby . " " Is it . . . unhappy ? Will it bother you ? Because if it does , we do n't have to do it . " " I do n't mind . " " Good . Do n't you sort of like having it ahead of us ? Something to look forward to in the evenings ? " " If that 's the way you want it , that 's the way I like it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomy . You scare me when you get the way you were last night , lashing out at everything , including yourself . You know you do n't believe everything you said . " I was not so sure of that as she was , but I was n't in a mood to be contrary . " Put it down to historical queasiness , " I said . " I alwaysdid get a little seasick riding backwards . " Seasick or not , we were at it again after dinner , summing up a day or a life.  |p122May  21 , Orebyslot , Lolland : As she usually is when I get around to communing with my Geist , Ruth is asleep , this time in a canopied four-poster , a real lit du roi , the duplicate of the one I am in . The room is enormous  --  two rooms , actually , two of about twenty in this wing  --  with casement windows through which come stray tree- and cloud-interruptedstreaks of moonlight and a smell of lilacs and lindens . As the trees outside move in a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth 's bed , and then scoots back to the windows as if afraid it might have awakened her . Fat chance . As for me , I hunch here under a dinky forty-watt bulb ( why are Europeans , even in castles , so scared of adequate lighting ? ) with no more likelihood of sleeping than of understanding what 's been going on . What was going on at lunch , for example ? The countess promised to explain later , but we have n't seen her since . And what aborted dinner  --  the old lady 's illness , as advertised , or something else ? And who is Miss Weibull ? Most of all , why did I , fifty years old , out of shape , out of practice , just recovering from a long spell of illness , accept the challenge of the werewolf who runs this place , and try to beat his brains out on the tennis court ? He comes on me like Sir Kay the Seneschal coming on the ConnecticutYankee , and says to me , " Fair Sir , will ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you giving me ? Get along back to your circusor I 'll report you , " I take him on . My hand is blistered , the skin is peeled off the bottoms of my feet , and I am already so stiff that if I tried to get out of bed I would break in two . I deserve a coronary , as Ruth did not fail to point out while we were eating the dinner that Room Service brought up.  |p123But  I have made my pilgrimage to my mother 's cottage . It was as meaningless as I knew it would be . The cultural vitamin deficiency is not appeased by nibbling the clay and plaster of the old home . The cultural amputee is still trying to scratch the itch in the missing limb . Nell , set it down . We got here about eleven . The castle , to Ruth 's mild disappointment , is not Gothic , with turrets , but Dutch Renaissance , with stepped gables . Wicked brother , as promised , not at home . Greeted by his wife , Manon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sweet puckered face that looks as if she is always trying to remind herself not to forget something , and little black dots of eyes like a Laurencin drawing . In the vast front hall , tinkling with the sound of a fountain around which Thorwaldsen-type nymphs clustered , in the presence of a brawny maid and a couple of Chinese jars that probably concealed elves , dwarves , or the forty thieves , she and the countessfell into each other 's arms . The maid picked up our bags and led Ruth and me up the stairs , while the countess called after us , " Oh , come straight down , as soon as you have finished your washings ! Gerda will unpack you . I must show you this castle where I grew up ! " All pleasure for her , apparently . No bad associations , only delight at being back home in the grandeur to which she has grown unaccustomed to being accustomed . We did come straight down , after Ruth had made a quick inspection of our ducal suite , and were shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each grander than the last , all ornate and gilded , French as to furniture and Beauvais as to tapestries , these last bearing the usual representations of stag hunts , successful , and Arcadian picnics , topless . Music room : square Bechstein , celestina inlaid with mother-ofpearl , gilt velvet-seated chairs , exhausted cello case prostrate on a banquette . Ballroom : a basketball court overhung with crystal chandeliers ,  |p124french  doors all down one side reflecting their slant light across the parquetry and showing us reaches of lawn and roses outside . Conservatory ( orangerie ? ) : a jungle of steamy plants from which a Rousseau tiger might have looked out  --  might be looking out now that everybody but me is asleep . Billiard room : two tables . Around the room trophies of the chase  --  stuffed pheasants and grouse , a rhino head , a cape buffalo head , a long row of stag heads labeled as to year and slayer . Some of these the King 's and the King 's father 's . Lion and leopard skins on the floor , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an onyx launching pad . Now the library , famous for works on horticulture and game management , here probably still called venery  --  everything from medieval herbals and bestiaries to contemporary learned journals in four languages . It seemed to me that these books made both Manon and the countess nervous ; they stood back , politely giving me , the visiting book man , plenty of time to examine and admire , but showing a transparent willingness to pass on . Having no expertisein either horticulture or game management , and seeing them hover there trying not to hurry me , I put back the volume whose binding I had been admiring , and said , " These are impressive , but over my head . I 've got other imperatives . " Oh , what ? they said . So I plucked from the shelf a Goethe in German andread them the last line of Faust : " Das Ewig-Weibliche zieht unshinan . " Manon managed to take that piece of japery as a complimentto her , and the countess gave me a snickering look that said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of look , asking me in effect who I thought I was , Little Lord Fauntleroy ? Whom we met as soon as we started out of the library  --  a pale , pretty , solemn little Swedish baron of about ten , a nephew of Manon 's , on his way in to read Duns Scotus or something else light . He wore blue serge short pants and an Eton collar and jacket , and he was the quietest , politest , most watchful little boy I ever saw in my life . I asked him if he spoke English and he squeaked , " Lillebit. "  |p125Ruthie  was enjoying the tour , and the ladies chattered , and I came along on my leash . Through a quickly opened door we were given a glimpse of a great pantry , with a board where lights went on to indicate what room was calling , and a receding warren of subsocial rooms and kitchens and such  --  the only rooms , I supposed , that my mother might ever have seen , if she had seen those . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with satiny sideboards , heavy silver , a table forty feet long with three great bowls of lilacs spaced along it , and walls covered with the usual wigged ancestors and muddy Danish landscapes . I was tempted to ask why the Dutch should have produced a regiment of great painters , while their close relatives up the North Sea coast , with the same blood , weather , light , sky , and architecture , never produced a one . But since the countess is herself a sort of artist , I admired the silver instead . The countess was happily recalling dinners in this room with a thousand candles and four wines , times when the King had come down to hunt . Then , she said to me , you would have seen some skaal'ing ! Privately I thought the room too grand to have any fun in , and much too big for the present party . The table was set only at one end  --  seven places . The countess noted the number , too . " Who is coming ? " she asked Manon . " Grandmama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and to greet your friends . And of course Bertil . " The countess ' eyes were on the seventh plate ; then they came up and met Manon 's . That was a speaking look if I ever heard one , though I did n't understand the words . The countess ' mouth tightened till she was white around the lips . Manon lifted a thin sweatered shoulder . The butler came in and announced lunch . There was little masculine company to distribute , just Little Lord Fauntleroy and me . We waited . After several minutes a woman , not especially young but very pregnant , came carrying her great belly before her from one of the parlors . She had a broad , healthy-looking face and a way of smiling slyly to herself . I thought she was faking a composure she did n't quite possess.  |p126Manon  thrust out her lips into a nervous pucker and blinked her round eyes . In Danish she said to the woman , " You remember Astrid . " The woman gave what can only be called a scornful snort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an extraordinary response . " Naturligvis " she said . " Velkommen . " Her eyes touched the eyes of the countess for just an instant . A complex expression passed across her face and was covered over by the careful sly smile . " God dag , " the countess said  --  oh , icy . " And these are Astrid 's friends , Mr. and Mrs. Allston . " " God dag , " the woman said . And we said . " Miss Weibull , " Manon said . I had an immediate semaphore from Ruth , which said , withflapping red flags , DO NOT SAY ANYTHING ! DO NOT , REPEAT DO NOT , ASK HER WHO HER HUSBAND IS OR WHAT HE DOES . DO NOT SAY ANYTHINGBEYOND ROUTINE POLITENESS . TAKE CARE . BE ALERT . SHUT UP . She assumes that I have all the acuteness of a mongoloid , and so she stands on tiptoe and wigwags wildly enough to catch the attention of everyone within a half mile , and unless I give her back a signal as obvious as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original situation that set her to signaling but have somehow overlooked the fact that she is now up on the table flappingher arms . In this case I carefully did not look at her . I smiled at the countess , who was stony , with an angry flush around her eyes , and at Manon , skinny and nervous and maintaining her sweet vague expression . Then I finally did look across at Ruth and widen my eyes slightly so she could relax . With her help , I managed not tosay to this Miss Weibull , HOW COME YOU 'RE A MISS , BUT EIGHTMONTHS ALONG ? OLD DANISH CUSTOM , EH ? HA-HA . Ruth said fiercely from the bed , " Just remember the times when I 've saved you from making a fool of yourself ! And some of the times when I have n't succeeded ! " " You overreacted , " I said . " You generally do , because you takep127it for granted I ca n't see what 's under my nose . You started this truth party , now hold still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless I 'd warned you , you 'd never have known anything was wrong . " " I wrote this journal that very night , did n't I ? Would n't you say I 'm aware that something is wrong ? " " After I warned you . Anyway , you did n't know what was wrong . " " Do n't tell me you did . " " I think so . Part of it , anyway . " " I think you found out just the way I did , and when I did . " " Well , do we have to quarrel about it ? " " No . So why did you start quarreling ? " " I ? You started it . " I counted ten , then ten more . She saw me doing it , and was furious . Finally I said , " Listen , if there 's anything more ridiculous than two people seventy years old ... " " Speak for yourself ! " ... or nearly seventy , bickering about who knew what twenty years ago , then it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started the bicker . " " All right , but . . . " " No buts . Peace , perturbed spirit . " " Oh , I hate that condescending phrase ! " " Condescending ? " I said . " Who said it ? Prince Hamlet to his father 's ghost ? " " Oh , go on and read . And I hope you get through that luncheonpretty soon . There were more important things happening than that luncheon . " " I read what it says in the book , " I said . " What it says in the book is what seemed important to me at the time . If you do n't like it , write your own diary . " " I wish I had . Then there might be a way of checking on yours . " We were still standing , waiting . I kept expecting Manon to tell us to sit down , but she did n't . Beside me this mysterious Missp128Weibull stood flat-footedly , breathing hard . She had that faked composure , but she did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble ? But governess to whom ? There were no children around except Bertil , who was only a visitor . But not family either . One of Count Eigil 's peasant girls ? You did n't bring those into the castle , or at least I assumed you did n't . Those could be left in the hayloft with their dresses up around their necks . The countess hated her being there , Manon was resigned to her being there , and Miss Weibull was damned well going to be there whether they liked it or not . The most obvious thing about all of it was that all three seemed to believe they were concealing what was perfectly obvious . Also , the more I looked at Miss Weibull the more I saw that she was pretty old to be in the condition she was in . She had to be around forty , about the countess ' age . Like people at a funeral before the preacher enters , we waited , and smiled , and said nothing , and were desperately bright . The bowls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scent . Now , I grew up among lilacs , I am a lilac lover , and group silences that go on too long make me nervous . So I said to Miss Weibull , most politely , " Are n't the lilacs marvelous ? " " Jeg taler ikke Engelsk , " said Miss Weibull . Put on my mettle , I sniffed deeply and appreciatively , rolled my eyes , looked pointedly at the lilacs , sniffed again , and placed a hand over my heart . I searched my mind in vain for the Danish word for lilacs , and had to fall back on something less precise . " Smukke Blomster , " I said . I suppose I felt an obligation to make her feel at home . Most curiously she looked at me . I have been looked at that way by cows watching me climb through a barbed wire fence . " Ah , oui , " she said . Across the table , as if on signal , the countess and Manon straightened their backs . Ruth was about to start her semaphore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lilacs . Then their three pairs of eyes turned sideward , and I looked where they were looking . Here came Grandmama on a servant 's arm . She was so old she would have had to be dated by carbon 14 . Conforming to the rule that old ladies should give up primaryp129colors and return to the pastels of babyhood , she wore a dustypinkjersey dress that hung on her like a sweater on a gate . She was thin and brittle . Veins and tendons stood out on the backs of her blotchy hands . Below the sagging jersey dress , which came to mid-calf , her stockings drooped on unpadded bone . The skin had shrunk on her skull , which looked no bigger than a monkey 's , and the shrinkage had all gathered into wrinkles . Her face was a spiderweb with eyes . As we might have watched George Arliss making an entrance , we watched her slide and shuffle toward us . Her eyes were fixed straight ahead on something miles away , disdaining to look for the obstacles her feet felt for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had one of those little thrills of sensation that sometimes come with martial music . Pride , she had . If the servant had withdrawn his arm , she would have fallen on her back , not on her face . She looked like one of those Milles ghosts , running on her heels toward eternity . The servant was careful and slow . The old lady 's shuffling foot reached the edge of the Chinese rug and felt , inched , slid up over it . Then as she brought the rear foot up over the edge to meet the front one , she brought her eyes down from whatever horizon they were fixed on , and took us all in in one look . It may have been intendedas a greeting ; it felt as peremptory as a bullwhip . Manon and the countess jumped to help the servant get her into the chair at the head of the table . Supported by six hands , she teetered and sank , and went the last four inches with a bump . She clenched her claws on the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only then , her difficult entrance accomplished , she turned her cheek up to the countess , who bent and kissed it . There was a flurry of bird sounds , much pressing of hands . When the countess left her and came around  --  widely around  --  Miss Weibull to place herself on my other side , her eyes were wet . Manon stood with her hand on the old lady 's shoulder . Solicitousand gentle , she bent and said , " Grandmama , here are Astrid 's friends , Mr. and Mrs. Allston . " The old red-rimmed eyes touched Ruth and then me , a glancep130surprisingly steady , though her whole head shook . She crossed an arm across her breast and laid a hand on Manon 's , still on her shoulder . I liked that gesture , as I liked the tears in the countess ' eyes . Aristocracy humanized . Three affectionate women . " You are very welcome here , " the old lady said in English . Across the table the little baron , with perfect timing , pulled out Manon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and turned to Ruth . As for me , I was torn between the countess and Miss Weibull , and had to elect Miss Weibull as being on my right and enceinte at that . When I got her bulk shoved up to the table against the resisting pile of the rug , the countess had seated herself . She gave me a blank , pleasant , annoyed smile as I edged in between them . It did not begin as the liveliest luncheon I ever attended . Manon was quiet , the countess nearly mute . Ruth tried , in English , to catechize the little baron . The old lady dabbled and picked at her food , Miss Weibull ate heartily for two . There was fruit soup , then a great salad of the shrimps they dip up from among the sea grass in these brackish estuaries , then a mousse and that universal Danish addiction , marzipan cookies . And , praise God , wine . As soon as I properly could , I skaal'ed the lady on my left and got her to melt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the ladies in turn . I did n't know whether I was supposedto or not , but there was no one else to do it  --  the little baron did n't even have a wineglass  --  and I thought we could all use a drink . It was a strange sensation holding the eyes of the old countess , like peering through the cobwebbed window of an abandoned house and meeting the eyes of something alive looking out . I also gazed into the eyes of Miss Weibull , as enigmatic and impenetrableas marbles . Ruth remarked on how humiliating it was for Americans , but how pleasant , to travel in a country where it seemed everyone spoke English . ( And who was it who had refused to try to learn Danish ? ) Manon repeated something Astrid 's father used to say  --  that if a Dane fell into the sea and washed up to the south , he would have to know German ; if he washed up to the west , Eng/lish or French ; if to the north or east , Norwegian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was compelled to prepare for the day when he fell into the sea . The countess , coming out of her sulks , claimed that if Mr. Allstonfell into the sea he would come up speaking anything he needed to , and Manon said ah , but that was because he was really a Dane , and to the old lady she explained that Mr. Allston 's mother had been born in Bregninge , was n't that interesting ? The old lady 's head wobbled back on its scrawny stem . " Here ? " " Here in Bregninge , yes . " " What family ? Are we related ? " " Oh no , " I said . " She worked on one of the farms . " " One of our peasants ? " In that room , the word " peasants " had a nasty arrogant sound , and I was n't exactly taken with the " our , " either . " Yes , " I said . But they were too polite to expose their prejudices even if they had them , as perhaps they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest out of her wrinkles , and quavered , " Where is she now ? What was her name ? Have you come to visit your relatives ? " " She died years ago , " I told her . " Both of her parents died of smallpox when she was an infant . I never heard her mention any other relatives . Her name was Ingeborg Heegaard . " I became aware that Miss Weibull had turned her head and stopped chewing and was watching me with interest . Why ? She spoke ikke Engelsk and could n't have understood anything I said . But she spoke some French , evidently , which was interesting . She must have fallen in the sea only once . I found myself giving her a token smile in passing , while I paid attention to the old lady , who was sorting through the drawers of her mind and not finding what she was looking for . " No , " she said , " I remember no one by that name . " " I 'm sure the family had run out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some people named Sverdrup . " It was as if I had broken wind . For a split second  --  et ojeblik as they say in Denmark  --  the table froze . At least the old lady andp132Manon did , and I had the strong impression that the countess did , though I was turned away from her . Miss Weibull was very interested . A moment only , and then people were breathing again , the table was casual , my faux pas was ignored out of existence , had never happened . Whatever it was . " Yes , " the old lady was saying as if the conversation had never broken down , " it must be fascinatingto visit where she came from . It must be very different from America . And your father , who was he ? " I suppose I was feeling bruised and aggrieved and bewildered . Somewhat sullenly , I said that he was a brakeman on the Chicago , Milwaukee and St. Paul , and got a stiff look from Ruth . Manon motioned the servant , who brought around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady paddled and dabbled and touched her puckered lips with her napkin , Manon laid her napkin on the table . Signals went around among those people in a way that Ruth should study , and before I knew we had ended our conversation the servant was at the back of the old lady 's chair and Manon was there helping to hoist her to her feet . Stiff between their lifting hands , and looking like death , she said to me , " We must talk again . It has been . . . very pleasant . Now I must ask that you excuse me . I tire easily these days . Please make yourselvesentirely at home . I am happy to have you here . " They started her out , and I turned just in time to run into anotherof those speaking looks that the countess was directing at Manon , who was looking back over her shoulder as she moved . At once the countess smiled , and Manon smiled . Manon said , " PerhapsMr. and Mrs. Allston will want to rest . Or to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . " Of course , we said . As you wish . Do n't worry about us . Miss Weibull was planted where I had landed her as we rose . It is hard to tell about pregnant women , their bloat makes it impossible to see them as they really are , but I thought she might once have been a quite splendid animal , and there was no doubt at all about her interest in me . She laid a finger upright against her pursed lips and said through it , " Ingeborg Heegaard . . . . De ? Elie etait . . . ? "  | " My mother . Min moder . Yes . " Miss Weibull wagged her head , her pondering finger still at her lips . Her eyes grew wide and round , the way eyes do when their owners are about to go boo at children . " Hun var min modern veninde ! " she said with an air of great conviction , and some sort of triumph , and maybe a dash of malice , and glanced sidelong at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't . She turned , smiling her sly smile , and steered her belly out of the room . That left Ruth , the countess , the little baron , and me . " What in God 's name , " I said . The countess was upset . " It is complicated . It is incredible . I will explain you sometimes . Later . " " What does veninde mean  --  friend ? " " Yes . " " And who is Miss Weibull ? " " Her mother was a Sverdrup . " " That reminds me of the Arab proverb : Ask a mule who his fatherwas , and he 'll always say , My mother was a horse . ' " " Joe , " Ruth said . The countess was really upset . " Can you wait ? Pleass ? I will explainall things . Later . " " I wonder if we should wait , " I said . " I do n't want to be rude , but it seems I already have been . I 've said something unforgivable . Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " She put her hand on my arm and shook me . " You must not feel so ! It is only . . . Pleass , you must not think of leaving , Manon and Grandmama would be miserable . I too . Listen ! You wanted to see your mother 's house . If it was the Sverdrup cottage , I can tell you . It is at the end of the entrance drive , the very end , before you go down the hill on the church path . You should see the church too , it is old and quite good . Perhaps both of you ? " " I think I 'll lie down for a while , " Ruth said . She never looked less happy . " Yes ! " the countess said . She was frantic to get us out of her hair . " A little nap , you will feel better . And you take a walk , andp134make no worries . Eh ? We will talk later . I will come to your room after I have seen Manon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put her arm around reluctant Ruth , who went along as if up gallows hill . She was trying to send me some signal , but her machinery was so shorted out I could not tell what she was trying to say . There I was , alone with the little baron , who had been taking this all in , more interested than his training would quite let him be . I winked at him , took a krone out of my pocket , showed it to him , snapped my fingers , and opened my empty hand . A half-suspicious , wavering smile . He reached out and opened my other hand , and while he was looking for the coin there , I took it out of his ear . He fished among his pocketful of English and came up with a word . " Again ! " Or maybe it was igen . Relatedlanguages have these happy correspondences . So I disappeared a few more kroner for him and finally showed him how it was done . When I left for my walk he was standing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coin up the sleeve of his Eton jacket . The castle 's drive is a good mile long , absolutely straight , nearly level along the crest of the ridge , and bordered all the way by flowering lindens . They filled the air with sweetness and dropped sticky liquor onto the gravel and now and then onto me . It began to drizzle before I had gone a hundred yards . The view down the slope to the right , through the English park with its big spaced oaks and bursts of rhododendron and lawns that ran down to the very edge of the sea , was dim and romantic . I saw it , or tried to see it , with my mother 's eyes . She had lived at the end of this lane , and undoubtedly walked along it sometimes , and stood back respectfully when the great folks from the castle passed . And dreamed , maybe . And had friends to whom she talked about what she 'd like to do and be , and what she 'd like to see . Miss Weibull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day she had gone down to the little harbor almost corked by its green island , and taken the ferry to Copenhagen , and like a bewilderedanimal crowded aboard an immigrant boat , and voyaged top135America . There was something that made the women of the castletighten their mouths and straighten their backs , and my mother was somehow part of it . And in I come , into this Old World shenanigan , like Miss Connie Coincidence herself . Incredible , the countess said . I guess . But not by any means intelligible . The upper side of the drive is all one big planting of pines , with lines of shelter trees between the rows  --  a future forest as neat as a vegetable garden . Straight ahead of me the spire of a stone church rose above the trees , and short of the church , set in a green meadow at the end of the pine planting , was the cottage . It was an absolutely standard Danish farm cottage , stuccoed , with a red tile roof and eyebrow dormers , but it looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard , with flower beds inside the fence and a snowball bush in bloom on each side of the doorway . The barn behind the cottage stood open , two goats were tethered among the dandelions at the side , red cattle were grazing at the far end of the meadow . It did n't look like the hardship and poverty one was driven to flee from ; it looked like a postcard . Wet by the fine rain , the meadow was so green it hurt the eyes . Not knowing what to expect , I had visualized nothing , and though I looked the place over most curiously , there was no pang of recognition . I had no impulse to go in the gate and knock on the door . What would I have said ? " I 'd like to see Ingeborg Heegaard 's room , please , the one she slept in sixty years ago ? " Ridiculous . And yet my mother 's name was still known in that house . Why would Miss Weibull remember the name of a friend of her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I was walking slowly , rubbernecking . Just as I passed the gate , the cottage door opened and a girl appeared in it . A wench , a buxom one , Aphrodite in stocking feet , still yawning from her nap , her hands reaching back up under her blouse to fasten her undone brassiere . Staring at me , curious and bold , she finished hooking herself together and settled herself into her harness withp136a wriggle . She reminded me of Miss Weibull  --  and why not ? This was the Sverdrup house , they were probably related . I touched my beret to the blowzy hoyden in the doorway . " God dag . " Already in the midst of another yawn , she tried to cut it off with her hand , and produced a smothered laugh . " God dag . " Bubbling with her silly laugh  --  at what ? something about my American clothes ? the beret I wore against the drizzle ? the mere fact that I was a stranger ?  --  she watched me pass by . That was my visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrimage to the source . Not worth the price of admission . When the drive turned down toward the village , I followed the path that kept on through a green hollow and up the church hill . The church was very old . Its doors of built-up planks were grayed and weathered , the grain so raised that it half effaced the carving . Inside the vestibule , hardly bigger than the hall of an ordinary house , was an enormous poor box made from a section of the trunk of an oak . It was four feet across , hooped around with five or six bands of heavy iron , and fitted with an iron lid . Through the lid on each side came an iron hoop as thick as my finger , and in each hoop was a hand-wrought padlock the size of a good-sized lobster . The coin slot was three inches long and a quarter inch wide , suitable for the coppers of giants . The thing looked as if it had been made to withstand Viking raiders  --  too heavy to lift , too strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a wispy young man in a black robe and an Elizabethan ruff came into the vestibule from the church . He stopped , surprised : a Danish clergyman who finds anybody in his church these days is bound to be surprised . He spoke to me and I replied . Then there seemed nothing more to say . After a questioningmoment he went softly through the door and outside . In a spirit of scientific research I fished out of my pocket the krone I had been snapping up my sleeve for the little baron and dropped it into the slot of the poor box . It fell with a dry sound on wood . No giant coppers in there , nothing at all in there , evidently . I wondered how often they took off the manhole coverp137to collect the loot . I imagined the thin young clergyman in his ruff coming out with foot-long keys on an iron ring , unlocking the massive padlocks one after the other , prying up the ponderous lid , and reaching in to scrape up a button , a couple of Tuborg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my single krone . At least the poor box , armored like Fort Knox , made poverty authentic and tangible , as the Sverdrup cottage did not . It made more plausible the flight of my mother , at an age no greater than that of the wench who now perhaps slept in her room . It said something about meagerness and lack of generosity and feudal limitation , it radiated suspicion in the very act of soliciting alms . Inside , though , the church said something entirely different . It was small , clean , painted white , the prototype of dozens of little Lutheran churches I have seen in the Middle West except that it was built of stone and that the altar under its grayish lace was more high church . But what took my eye was the ships ' models hanging on wires from the ceiling . There must have been a dozen of them , three-masters , trawlers , even one white passenger ship with rows of portholes . Each had a card tacked to it , detailing the shipwreck from which its grateful maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity expressed by the poor box . Each one of these lovely things was a prayer of thanksgiving . I was reminded of Karen Blixen 's remark that Denmark was full of retiredsea captains growing roses . Maybe poor old Bertelson , headed for the Swedish village of his childhood , had something after all . Whatever it was to me ( nothing ) , this placid island in its landlocked sea was for the makers of these models the ultimate safe place. ambiguous church , speaking simultaneously of deprivation and sanctuary . Its antiphonal voices may well have come from different periods , different ages even , the place seemed so old . As I went around reading the cards on the hanging models , I came to a little bare cell to the right of the front door , with a long horizontalslit in the wall facing the altar , and a little door that opened to the outside . This was the medieval leper chapel , where the afflicted and dying could hear and see the mass withoutp138offending the sight of their families and friends . I make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when I tried to imagine myself into that ten-by-twelve cell with other noseless , fingerless , suppurating sufferers , and to ponder what consolationI might get from crowding to a crack in the wall to hear somebody in a starched ruff preach God 's mercy , I found myself wanting to be out in the air . So out of the church and down the hill and up again to the lindenlane . At its end , a mile away , the ivied front and stepped gablesof the castle sat like a barricade  --  absolute destination , utter terminus , total power . No ambiguity there . The Sverdrup cottage , as I passed it , showed no sign of life , but when I was a couple of hundred yards down the drive , I heard a door close and looked back to see a man come out the gate and turn my way . I went on , not hurrying . The drizzle had stopped , there were ragged clouds dispersing out over the sea beyond the reaches of vivid lawn . The lane steamed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could hear his gritting steps on the gravel . Then just inside the iron gates , where the drive looped to circle before the doorway and enclosea medallion of impeccable lawn , I glanced back again , and he motioned with his arm and called to me . " Du ! " I stopped , and he came up  --  hard eye , hard mouth , bushy sandy eyebrows . Younger than I , vigorous mid-forties , probably , in a corduroyjacket and jodhpurs and an Ascot tie . He looked me up and down . His contemptuous " Du ! " and his arrogant air annoyed me , so I looked him up and down , too . Even without the resemblance  --  something about the eyes and the shape of the head  --  it would have been clear who he was . The wicked brother . I had seen him before plenty of times , without the feudal trappings  --  a muscular bulldozer , a pusher-around . " Hvad beh  --  ver Du ? " Some way to greet a guest . " I do n't behover anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk . " At once he tossed his head back and laughed . In English he said , " Of course , of course . You 're the one with Astrid . " Not " Sorry , we have to be careful of trespassers , " not , " Oh yes , glad to see you , I 'm Eigil R  --  dding . " Just , " Of course , you 're the one with Astrid . " I was ready to tell him I was not " the one " with anybody , and suggest where he could put his castle , and go to pack our bags . On top of the disturbing conclusion of lunch , his greeting about used up my eagerness to be entertained by the nobility . But my irritation , which I did not hide , amused him . Well , well , his look said . Feisty , eh ? Eat me alive , will you ? He had a thick neck inside his Ascot scarf , and his thighs and calves bulged his jodhpurs . His eyes had come from some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers . His were yellow . " So , " he said , with his hands in his pockets , " American , are you ? How are you enjoying Denmark ? " " Charming country , " I said . " Been here before ? " " No . " " You and your wife are living with Astrid . " " Yes . " " That must be cosy . " " We 've become very good friends . " It seemed he withheld comment . With his hands shoved down in his pockets and his shoulders pushed high , he watched the flight of some starlings off the gable and eventually turned his yelloweyes back on me . His accent he had learned in England . I do n't suppose he had had to learn there the upper-class manner which is never unintentionally rude . He jerked his head toward the castle . " The ladies taking good care of you ? " " They 've been very hospitable . " He understood me ; he grinned like a wolf . " I was unable to greet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We understood you were n't at home . " That made him laugh out loud . " I was instructed not to be . " Since he was obviously a man who had never taken instructionin his life , especially not from his women , there seemed nothing for me to say . Teetering in his jodhpur boots , clenching his handsp140inside his pockets , rolling his corduroy shoulders , he appeared at once abstracted and impatient , itchy with the need to be doing something . He looked me over again , this time without hostility . " What do you do ? " I told him I was a literary agent . " Really ? That 's interesting . " ( His tone said it was not ) " Where ? " I did n't ask him where he thought anybody would be a literary agent . I only said mildly that it was a tribe found only in midtownManhattan . Out of a clear sky he said , " I do n't suppose you play tennis . " Fair Sir , will ye just ? I had to smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you suppose that ? " I said . Another appraisal of my parts and my pallor , and he said bluntly , " You do n't look like a tennis player . Are you ? " " I guess I do n't know what tennis players look like , " I said . " I used to play some . " " How about a game now ? " " This minute ? " " Why not ? It is n't going to rain any more . There are n't many tennis players on this island , I have to pick up a game when I can find it . " And what if the selected opponent does n't want to serve your lordship 's convenience ? " I did n't bring a racket or any clothes , " Isaid . Wrong response . He said , " That 's no problem . How big is your foot ? " and stuck his foot down beside mine . " Looks about right . Come along . " " No , " I said . " Thanks very much , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of shape . " He had already started to drag me off . Now he stopped . " Well , " he said , " of course it 's up to you . You know your capacitiesbetter than I do . " That did it . If I were in shape , if I had n't been sick . . . oh , the hell with caution . Come death , come dishonor , I wanted to put Von Stroheim down . At once my hesitation transformed itselfp141into an ambush . Shedding crocodile tears , smiling in self-depreciation  --  onemay smile , and smile , and be a villain ; at least I 'm sure it may be so in Denmark  --  I said , " It 's only that I do n't know if I could give you a game . But if you 're willing to take a chance ... " " Better a slow game than none at all , " says this Eigil R  --  dding . I had n't had a racket in my hand since last summer , I had n't played in even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could n't summon up enough of what used to be there to make Eigil work for his exercise , I would eat three fuzzy new Slazenger tennis balls . So fifteen minutes after he intercepted me at his castle gate , I was warming up with him on a damp clay court near the stables , and thinking , Mistake , mistake ! I felt old and stiff , the balls were heavy , the racket unfamiliar and too big in the handle . There was no whip in my shots , the opposite base line looked fifty yards away . There I sat with my little paws on my chest , waiting to be run over . Because he was no dub . I suspect he was used to beating anybody in Denmark except maybe Torben Ulrik . He hit his forehand with a lot of juice on it , and it came off the damp clay whizzing . ' When I sent a floater over to his backhand , he wound up and explodedon it , a real old Western-grip broken-arm backhand of a kind I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national doubles . It went down the line like a rocket and bruised the fence . I kept scrambling , knocking them back off the rim and the handleor not getting them back at all . Eigil liked to score off you , he shot for the lines and corners even when warming up . I did get a little warm chasing balls . But little by little something began to come back , I hit a few forehands that felt right , I found that I could at least chip my backhand and control it . And when I went up to try a volley or two , and old Eigil threw me up a lob , I hit that one exactly where I wanted to  --  into the corner , where Eigil could chase it for a change . There was no point in delaying it . I was already getting winded . " Any time , " I said.  |p142He  stopped in mid-court and spun his racket . " Rough , " I said . He bent and looked . " Smooth . I 'll serve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He tried a couple of serves , and I got a look at them . Twist , with a sharp kick to the backhand . A juicehead all the way . So I moved to the left and a little back to give myself room , and he aced me with a sliced one into the forehand corner . In the odd court I moved up , thinking I 'd try taking it on the rise , and he gave me one high on the backhand that I could n't handle . I lost the game at love , won only one point on my own service , and lost the third game , also at love . Time for the Seventh Cavalryto come riding down the Little Big Horn . Both his forehand and his backhand were hot as a firecracker , but it seemed to me he had to hit them close to his body , it seemed to me that , like a lot of topspin players , he might not be able to reach . So I served wide to his forehand and came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay-away volley . I tried the same thing in the odd court , and same result . Right then I began to think I could take him if I did n't burst a blood vessel with all that running . If I stayed back , his ground strokes would murder me . But he was used to hitting them deep ; I did n't think he could consistently put them at my feet as I came up , and if he did n't get them at my feet they came over high , begging to be swatted . And I must say that when he fed me one of those shoulder-high returns , it was a pleasure to see him strain and lunge , or go smokingoff in the wrong direction when he anticipated wrong . I was n't able to break him back , and he took the first set 6-3 . By the time I stepped up to the line to serve the first game of the second set I had a blister forming at the base of my thumb , I was soaked with sweat , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I was damned well going to take him , and I did . We went with service through the fifth game , and then I broke him with a net cord shot and a sliced backhand down the line  --  God , Ip143loved myself . Then all I had to do was hold service and I had him , 6  --  4 . Enough . Quit with honor . I had been running on the sides of my feet for ten games . I went straight to the grass at the side of the court and sat down and took off one shoe and sock . A big flap of skin was peeled off the ball of the foot , with red meat exposed underneath . " What is it ? " Eigil was saying , smacking the top of the net with his racket . " We ca n't stop now , a set apiece ! " " I 'll have to default , " I said , and held up my scalped foot . You never saw such disappointment . FIe was raging with it , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in in the last two minutes to pull out the game . Of course he had won , since I could n't continue . But the score was dead even , and he had had to run his tongue out . I was willing to settle for that . I flopped on my back on the lawn , tasting brass , my lungs burning , my heart pounding , and my feet on fire  --  and if the truth were told , thankfulto my feet for getting me out of more . Eigil took two towels off the net post , yanked one around his neck , and came over and dropped one to me . Oddly , his disappointmentwas over . He was elated , exhilarated by combat , full of chivalry and sportsmanship . His face was red and happy . " You know , you 're too modest by half , " he said , panting . " You really are a tennis player . " " Was , " I said . I felt like dying . " You 're amazing for your age . Were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher than the third ten . " " But in the United States , that 's tremendous . I used to follow these things in the Spalding Tennis Annual . Who were the numberone people in your years ? " " Tilden ? " I said . " Johnny Doeg ? Ellsworth Vines ? Riggs ? Don Budge ? " " Did you ever play them ? " I mopped my face and neck and flopped my head to look at him . He sat on the grass , towel around his neck , eager and enthusiastic , an admirer . In a minute he would ask for my autograph . Instead of being upset that I had split with him , he apparentlyp144had this fantasy of having held his own against an American internationalistwith a houseful of cups . " Played some of ' em , " I said . " Never beat any of ' em . " But I did n't have the heart to deflate him completely . " After college I only played in tournaments for a few years . In my senior year my partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I was ranked . " " Yes , doubles ! " old Eigil says . " I could tell you 're a splendid doubles player . The way you punch a volley , the way you hit your overhead . I need to play more with people who play your game , serve and volley . Why do n't you stay a month and we 'll play every day . " I think he meant it . I was almost sorry to remind him that we were leaving in the morning , and that even if we were n't , I would n't be able to play on those feet for at least week . There we sat , pouring sweat and rehashing shots , a couple of locker-room jocks . I have to admit that I 've always enjoyed the company of jocks more than that of the literary intellectuals and hyperthyroid geniuses among whom , unhappy one , I earned my living . Also , I had n't had any company but that of women since we landed in Denmark , more than six weeks ago . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was delighted with me . After we showered he found me some Band-Aids to patch my feet . Then nothing would do but I must see the estate . I said that my wife , whom I had left at two o'clock , would wonder what had happened to me . Promptly he called the castle and told somebody that Mr. Allston would be in around seven . My feelings were mixed . My mind 's eye kept wandering to the bottle of scotch in my suitcase  --  I knew that Ruth would expect to hold a note-comparing session over it before dinner . Instead , here I was hobnobbing with the hobgoblin . I wondered where he would go for dinner , since we were pre-empting his castle . Lonely service in the library , with smoking jacket , brandy , and cigar ? A tray in the kitchen ? To the stable to eat with the horses ? To BregningeInn for Koldt bord and beer ? A good old-fashioned Dracula picnic in some local graveyard ?  |p145It  seemed to me he was being pretty good-natured in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He had been around  --  England , where he was educated , and Italy , some , and France and Germany a good deal , and the United States once , with an agricultural mission . He remembered Decorah , Iowa , for some reason . He knew a lot of people and had read books and knew what went on . I had to admit that once he got past his impulse to throw me out as a trespasser he had been good company . See the estate ? All right , why not ? He said it was the most scientifically run estate in Denmark , perhaps in the world . The very compulsiveness of his brag made me curious . And I supposed that he was the one who had got Miss Weibull pregnant , but who she was , and what she was doing in the castle , and why the countesswas so implacable against him for what was , in emancipated Denmark , surely no mortal sin  --  those were things a man might find out . Okay , let 's go . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular sea , I found myself without the linguisticwherewithal . Without a Danish word I climbed into the Volkswagen parked outside the stables , and we toured the farm . It is n't a farm , it 's an economy . In an hour and a half of whizzingaround an area about the size of Delaware , he showed me wheat fields , beet fields , truck gardens , three different varieties of hybrid corn he 's experimenting with , and a battery of greenhouses . Also pine plantings , cherry orchards , apple orchards , game coverts , and pastures . Also pigpens , cow stables , henhouses , pheasantand grouse hatcheries , and kennels full of German short-haired pointers and English setters . Also a sawmill , smokehouse , dairy , cheese factory , and refrigerated fruit warehouse . There are two other villages besides Bregninge on the estate , and he owns the port and all its facilities ; for all I know , he may have a private merchant fleet . And he is no raw material producer only . Everythinghe grows , he processes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made into Cherry Heering , and the sugar beets , which go , I think he said , to Kiel.  |p146I  heard a good deal about confiscatory taxes and a government that lay in wait until a landowner died and then came down on the heirs . I gathered that things had shrunk sharply when his fatherdied in the 193os . But he had a bit left . At the hour we went around , there was hardly a working soul in sight . He had everythingmechanized , even automated . The peasants who used to work on the place must all be up in Copenhagen on welfare ( my mother got out just in time ) . Crops grow by blueprint . The pigs come off the belt line within a pound of their bacon weight . While the milking machines relieve them of their day 's production , the cows can contemplate on the stanchions by their heads the charts that reveal their intakein grain and ensilage and their output in milk and butterfat . No contented cows there . Stakhanovized cows . No tickee , no laundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is schnitzel . Everything clean , nothing smelly , nothing wasted . The straw that most Danish farmers burn in their fields , Eigil bales and uses for fuel to heat his greenhouses , which produce the year round . Now I know where those hard little tomatoes come from , and those incessant cucumbers . He is proud of the hay-burning furnace , which he designed himself . " You 've got a lot to be proud of , " I said , and meant it . " You and your father . I understand he was called the Doctor Faustus of genetics . " His shoulder bumped mine , he twisted around in the cramped seat . " Where did you hear that ? " " Karen Blixen , I think . " " Oh , you 've met her . " " Last week . " " Better her than some others , " Eigil said sourly . " At least she 's intelligent . " " She said he was a very talented man . " " Was he not , " Eigil said , looking straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he were the Antichrist . He was the greatest man in Denmark , a century ahead of his time . Do you believe that ? "  |p147Without  half trying , he seemed to have worked himself into a rage . I said mildly that I knew nothing about his father , or next to nothing , but had no reason to think he was n't exactly what Eigil said he was . Nevertheless , as an unsuccessful father myself , I almostresented so much filial loyalty . Would Curtis have defended me if someone had questioned my intelligence or integrity ? I doubted it . But then I was n't the Doctor Faustus of anything , either . " All those rhododendrons you saw in the park are his hybrids , " Eigil said . " Half the roses  --  did you get taken into the rose garden out beyond the ballroom terrace ? Those pointers in the kennels are desired all over the world  --  that 's the finest strain anywhere . We grow and ship two varieties of apples he developed . So it goes , all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He improvedwhat he found . People talk about Mendel . My father looked through windows that Mendel did n't even know were there . " We were rolling softly along a dirt road between scrub woods and a pasture fenced with woven wire . From the woods , pheasants and grouse and what I took to be chukars watched us without flying . The pasture on the other side was humped with dozens of feeding hares as big as dogs . Everything was as Eigil said  --  nature improved , cultivated as carefully as his bacon hogs and pine plantings . Even the scrub woods were carefully cultivated scrub woods , the perfect game covert . And then as we rolled slowly and he talked about his father , with his eyes straight ahead and his jaw bunched up , he stepped suddenly on the brake . A buck , or stag I suppose they would call him , had just stepped out onto the bank of a ditch a hundred yards ahead . " Khhhhh ! " Eigil said in his throat . " There 's that bastard with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two quick moves , and we were accelerating out the way we had come in . As soon as we turned behind a screen of trees , he put his foot to the floor . We zipped around behind the stables and pulled up in a cloud of gravel next to the room where we had showered . Eigil jumped out , leaving the door open and the motor running . In ap148minute he came running back with a little Mannlicher in his hand . " Hold this ! " he said , and shoved it at me . Off again , like Crazy Horse on his way to intercept Custer . Of course the stag was gone when we got there , and five minutesof careful prowling failed to flush him . I was glad . I am not much on killing things , and I did n't need a lesson in selective breeding . " I ought to get back , " I said as soon as we got to the car again  --  me walking on the sides of my feet , my hips , knees , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sprouts clear to the ground , like the legs of some chickens , and peasants had harvested these sprouts for faggots year after year , leaving an extraordinary stubble of cut sprouts out of which grew new green ones . Never waste anything . Make faggots of your prunings , and make a business of making faggots . Eigil looked at the sun , bedding down in high clouds over the Baltic . " It 's not quite six-thirty . There 's time to show you the museum . Are you interested in archaeology ? " I thought I 'd better be , as the quickest way of closing out the tour . " I do n't know anything about the archaeology of Denmark , but sure , I 'd like to see it , if you have time . Just a quick look , and then I 'll have to go and dress . " Going back , we circled down to the shore , through the village , and up the hill to the lane of lindens . As we passed the Sverdrup cottage , the girl I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted his hand in casual greeting from the wheel , and she gawped after us as we headed toward the castle . I had an impulse to tell him my mother had lived in that house . Then I remembered that when I first saw him he had been coming out of it . Why not , he owned it . Visit from the landlord . Nevertheless , there was Miss Weibull , upon whom I suspected him of having exercised a few droits de seigneur , and she lived in that house , or once did . I decided that instead of revealing my family history I would praise the lane of lindens . Naturally they turned out to have been planted by Eigil 's father . The museum was a long half-timbered cottage beyond the sta/bles , three rooms full of the kind of stuff that quickly gives me museum feet and strabismus : tools , weapons , utensils , skulls , bones , a complete record of all the Danish horizons from the antler-and-bone culture to the Iron Age . Seems that Danish places whose names end in - inge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bregninge , according to Eigil , has been continuouslyinhabited since at least 4000 B.C. " All Danes , " he said with a grin . " There 's no evidence of any immigrations or invasions . These people raided other tribes , but they do n't seem to have been raided . My tribe . Except for an occasional captive woman , an essentially unmixed strain for six thousand years . You can imagine what that meant to my father . " I let it be assumed that I could . Still wearing his sidelong smile , Eigil took hold of a cloth that covered something the shape of a big bird cage . " Here , let me introduce my first known ancestor , " he said , and pulled off the cloth . Inside was this mummy his peat diggers had found . Its hands and feet were tied , and it had been strangled with a thong . The museum in Copenhagen thinks it was an executed prisoner of war or criminal , but Eigil thinks it was a sacrifice to keep the fields fertile . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hundreds of years before the invention of manure . In any case , I do n't want him to be a prisoner of war , because then he could n't have been my ancestor . Do n't you think we look alike ? " Simpering , he posed beside the bell jar , and by God , he did look a little like the mummy . I wondered if perhaps I did , but I did n't want to ask . Because that thing was more likely to be my ancestor than his . My folks undoubtedly belonged to the class that got strangled , his to the class that did the strangling . " You 're better looking , " I said . " The breed has improved since the Bronze Age . " Several times this afternoon I noticed his way of looking at me hard when I said something , as if he suspected double meanings . He is not a man who understands playfulness , I think , in spite of his competitive instincts . But there had not been a trace of hostilityin him since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pal . In fact , he had a look of eagerness , a certain impetuousnessof explanation and argument , as if he would n't mind converting me to something . To what ? Membership in a **26;3349;TOOLONG of Homo sapiens ? He did n't know , but I already had at least a guest card in that club . " You 'd be surprised , " he said . " There ca n't have been much change , especially in families like mine . We got a shot of Prussian and Hanoverian in the last couple of centuries , but that did n't greatly dilute us . We 're one of the rare examples of selective breeding of humans over a long period . First a pure type like this one , without mongrelization , and then a naturally selected superiorclass from that type  --  the biggest , strongest , most intelligent  --  and then the aristocratic practice of seldom breeding outside that class , at least officially . Aristocracies are always essentially endogamous . If we had used the same intelligence in breeding ourselvesthat we use to breed cows or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not necessarily being smug when I say my family and my class come as close as you 're likely to find . Even as it is , with infusions of Wendish and Polish and German and Swedish blood , we come close to being a pure strain , and unlike primitive endogamous groups , we have kept records . This was something that fascinated my father . " I was thinking of the countess ' remark that the men of her class were all drunks and the women all witches , and remembering vague sophomore biology courses which spoke of inbreeding and exhaustion . " You know a lot more about it than I do , " I said , " but as an American I have to stand up for hybrid vigor . " His eyebrows went up and his finger went up , he backed me against a case of old bones  --  relatives of ours , no doubt  --  and said , " Hybrid vigor , exactly . It 's a fact , it exists , it can be demonstrated . But it 's too accidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type as pure as that fellow there with the string around his neck , and while you 're developing the pure type you 'll have other results of mongrelization besides hybrid vigor . If it could only be done scientifically , that was what my father alwayssaid . He did n't mean play Hitler , he was not interested in ty/rannical eugenics or Brave New Worlds . He meant only that if there could be a controlled experiment over a good many generations , a demonstration clear enough to show the superiority of method over accident . When Darwin said that man is a wild species , he meant just that  --  nobody ever domesticated it or bred it scientifically for quality . " " What about the Egyptian royal line ? " " All right . Brother-sister incest through hundreds of years . But who was keeping track of the experiment ? Who made the kind of records that I make on my Holsteins ? What Pharaoh ever won a Best of Breed ribbon at a fair ? And who would permit any such experiment now ? Sentimental outrage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would move the human race a quantum jump forward . But nej , nej , thou shalt not . They would crucify anyone who suggested it , especially since Hitler gave it racist and fascist connotations . Eh ? " " I guess , " I said . " We need to know so many things we are prevented from finding out , " Eigil said , pinning me against the bone case . " It takes many generations to develop the qualities you want , without bad recessive traits . You breed dogs for decades to get the carriage , coat , docility , ferocity , intelligence , nose , whatever it is you 're after . If you could once get it pure , you could inbreed forever without bad results . But no line is pure enough , and so your dogs after a while show , say , hysteric traits , excessive nervousness , that sort of thing . Then you have to breed out for a generation or sometimes two . Not mongrelize  --  you do n't let your bitches run in the woods and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You pick another good line that has strength where yours has this weakness , and when you 've got it firmly built into your mixed strain , you turn back , you exchange exogamy for endogamy again . Think what it would mean to the human race if we had an elegant and incontrovertible experiment to show the transmission of certain traits in human beings . You would be on the way to eliminating physical defects , heritable diseases , even ugliness . Mendel thought everything could be explained by peas . Ip152know some people these days who think fruit flies will provide all the answers . But there is no alternative to experimenting with the animal itself . " I eased away from the case and flexed my blistered hand and looked at the blisters to suggest a change of topic . He was really on his pulpit , and preaching . " I do n't know , " I said . " I 'm not sure I want my gene pool manipulated . You know what I miss on this marvelous estate of yours ? " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinning again . His eyes were as yellow as amber . " Wild things , " I said . " Little cottontails or gophers or snakes or moles or raccoons or polecats that could breed in the hedges and live in spite of you . Holsteins and short-haired pointers are nice , but a little predictable . " Curious , smiling , he searched my eyes , trying to understand me and probably making it all too complex and difficult . " Why would I permit them ? " he said . " Why should they be allowed to eat what might feed my cows or hares or game birds or deer ? " " You were all set to shoot that buck with the bad horns , " I said . " How do you know he does n't have everything else a deer ought to have  --  size , strength , speed , a good digestion , virility , everything but good horns ? How do you know for sure that shooting him wo n't weaken the strain ? " The smile remained on his square face , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I raise them for trophies , " he said . There was an old Morris Minor parked in the drive when we walked to the front of the castle . Eigil gave it a glance . " The doctor . I suppose my grandmother is n't digesting well . " He stood there in his jodhpurs and corduroy , country squire , feudal lord , smiling and shaking his head regretfully . He put out his hand and gave my poor blistered mitt a hearty crushing . " I 'm going to have to write Astrid a thank-you note . I had no idea what she was bringing , or I would have insisted on being at home . " " I 'm glad you did n't entirely vanish , " I said . " I 've enjoyed the afternoon . "  | " So have I. Immensely . I 'm sorry I did n't meet your wife . Perhapsyou 'll both come again , without Astrid so that we wo n't have to play these silly games . " Embarrassed , I said , " I do n't understand anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope you see that in the circumstanceswe ... " " Of course . But come again , please . I hope your feet do n't troubleyou too much . I took advantage of you . But I want you to know , that was the best tennis I 've had for a long time . " We parted , mutually complimentary . He went away somewhere , and I rang the bell and was admitted by the brawny maid , who was obviously agitated . I could n't understand a word of her Danish , but she kept looking up the stairs , so I started up , to be met halfway by Ruth , crying , Oh , where have you been , I 've been going out of my mind ! You should n't have stayed out so long , what have you been doing ? Etc . Turns out the old countess was no sooner steered back to her rooms than she had a seizure of some kind , stroke , heart attack , nobody seemed to know . She might be dead or alive at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner was canceled , they would send something up . In the circumstances I did n't want to ring for ice . We had a couple of warm scotches and water while I told her what I had been doing , and with whom . She looked at my hand and my skinned feet and lamented . She wondered that I had n't had a heart attack , what on earth was I thinking of , how could I dream of playing tennis , the way I had been feeling ? Shortly the maid knocked and wheeled in a tea cart with dinner on it , and a good dinner , too , with a good cold bottle of Mosel , and over it we speculateda long while about this feud between the countess and her brother , and about Miss Weibull , and discussed my adventures down the lane and among the fields and woods and on the courts of honor . We kept expecting the countess to come and let us know what was going on , but it got to be ten-thirty , and then eleven , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helpless kiss and wentp154off to her canopied four-poster and after a while I heard that she was asleep . And here I sit , with thirty great wounds , of the least of which an emir would have died , scratching in a God damn notebook . Why ? Do I think I 'll forget this ? I can smell the lilacs that breathe up through the open casements , and watch the moonlight chase timidly back and forth across the Aubusson rug , advancing to Ruth 's bed , scurrying back , creeping out again . Outside it is not really dark ; we are getting close to the time of the white nights , when there is no true darkness , but only some hours of dusk . The sky now is either filled with moonlight or is the same predawn gray that it was when I looked out before going to bed . The moonlight ventures out , reaches , stretches , dimly trembles on the bedclothes , on the darkness of Ruth 's hair , the paleness of her face . I hope she is dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p156Ruth  has had no luck finding anyone to substitute for Edith Pattersonat the convalescent home . This morning at breakfast she braced me . How about coming down and talking to the old folks about contemporary writers ? I would be surprised how much they read and how responsive they were . I said what if I could n't think of a contemporary writer I wanted to talk about . " Oh , for heaven 's sake , do n't be that way ! There are dozens . " I said name one . She looked at me pretty stormily . It is her opinion that my distaste for many kinds of contemporary novelists , including the critic-intellectuals , the mythologizers , the fantasizers , the black humorists , the absurds , the grotesques , and the sexualizers , is as pigheaded as my prejudices against the young . She is of course right , I would n't argue with her . By definition a prejudice is a principle that its owner does not intend to examine . Which does not prove it is wrong . And what a comforting thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex scenes with the old folks ? " I said . " Do I start with the accepted major premise : if they are n't fucking it is n't fiction ? ( Unless , of course , they 're sucking , then it 's okay too . ) " " Do you have to be as repulsive as you say they are ? " " No . That 's why I wo n't discuss their novels with your old folks . " " They are n't all like that . " I said name one . " Well , if you wo n't talk about any American , talk about Cesare . " I said Cesare was as bad as any of them . The only good thingp157about him was that he really liked women and amore . But the effect was about the same . " Then tell them stories about him . He 's a regular mine of stories . Tell them about his visit the other day , they 'd love it . Make them laugh . " I said what if I did n't consider Cesare 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so abruptly that she slopped her coffee . " Oh , : what 's the matter with you ? Ca n't you laugh at yourself any more ? Laugh at me , then . Laugh at Minnie . Laugh at Cesare . Do n't just be a carping old man . It does n't matter what you sato them , it 's the interest you take in them that counts . " I said what if I did n't take any interest in them . What if they scared the pants off me and gave me the glooms . " Joe , " she said in despair , " it is n't you . You 've always been such a joker . And you 're not unsympathetic . I know you 're not . You 're a . . . marshmallow about other people 's troubles ! " She sounded so distracted that I quit playing my little game , which when you think of it is a little cruel . Even if I do n't want to talk to her shut-ins , I do n't have to rub it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legitimate excuse . " An aching marshmallow , " I said . " If I go out in the wind the way my joints are now , you 'll be taking care of me in bed . " " Have you been taking your indocin ? " " Popping them like peanuts . And that 's another thing , those pills eat away your stomach wall . Two more days and I 'll be back to my adolescent ulcers . " At that moment the " Today " show took a break to let a girl who " teaches college " tell about her headaches , and how she has found that there is something in Anacin , she does n't know what it is , but it works . Ruth , who is dangerously susceptible to suggestioneither overt or subliminal , said to me , " Maybe you ought to switch pain pills if indocin is so hard on you . Maybe Anacin would work . Or aspirin . Most people cure their arthritis with aspirin . " " Mama , " I said , " you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from your borders , you set up a **31;3377;TOOLONG around upstairs . " Murf licked his lips . " She got your nose open ? " Hood grabbed the front of Murf 's shirt and marched him backward against the wall . " There 's no bird , " he said . " You did n't see one , did you ? " " Yes , no , " said Murf . He gagged . " Hey , leave off ! " " You did n't see a house . " He twisted Murf 's collar , choking him . " I ca n't breeve ! " Murfs eyes bugged out , his earring danced . " Did you ? " said Hood softly . " Okay , okay , " said Murf , and Hood let go . " You 're murder , " said Hood . Murf rubbed his throat and looked uneasily at Hood , who said , " You 've got a lot to learn . " " I wo n't say nothin ' . " " Keep your friend Muncie out of here and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I see you "  --  he snatched at Murfs ear , but the boy ducked  --  " if I see you messing around again and shooting your mouth off , I 'll go ape-shit . And if I go ape-shit , pal , you 're in trouble . " " I 'm knackered , " said Murf . " Hey , want to turn on with me ? Here , I 'll make you one . " He fumbled with his cigarette papers and took out his stash . " Produce it . " They squatted in the dimly lit hallway . Murf nudged him and said , " Muncie 's a fence , but nothing like this . ' Ncredible . Hey , I meet all these geezers and I think they 're posh , and they 're really villains . This old girl the other day and now you . " He laughed at the thought of it and showed Hood the cigarette ; he smiled in friendship , moving his lips apart to reveal his stained tooth-pegs . " This all right ? " Hood said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next day , Mayo said , " You found it ? " " Right , " said Hood . " Ask Murf . " " I do n't know nothing , " said Murf.  | " But you know we found it , do n't you , squire ? " " Oh , yeah , I know that , " said Murf . " But I do n't know nothing else . " " So that 's why you wanted the van . I leave the house for six hours and I come back to a muddle . Give me the keys . " Hood handed her the keys and said , " There 's no muddle , sweetheart . Everything 's fine . We found the stuff , now stop shouting . " " Are you lying ? " asked Mayo . " Do snakes have elbows ? " " Where did it come from ? " Hood said , " When I get a few answers from you , sweetie , you 'll get some from me . " " I 've been straight with you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing . " " It 's too soon . But I 'll tell you this . There 's something big , a Provo offensive in England . We do n't want to blow it . " " Hear that , Murf ? " said Hood . " Yeah . " " Something big . An offensive . " " Yeah . " " But she does n't want to blow it . " Murf sniggered . " He thinks you 're full of crap , " said Hood to Mayo . " He 's a bright boy . " " Hop it , Murf , " said Mayo . " I want to talk to Hood alone . " " See you later , squire , " said Hood . Murf winked and hunched out of the room . " I 'm glad you two are finally getting on . " " We 're pals , Murf and me . He does n't know whether to scratch his watch or wind his ass , but we 're pals . " " Those televisions upstairs , all those boxes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're not telling me anything , so I 'm not telling you anything . I thought I could help .

It 's a joke , and so far I have n't done a goddamned thing . " " You did that passport . " " It takes ten minutes to make a passport . They do n't even realize that it 's harder to forge a visa than a passport  --  ask any consul . Look , I did n't join up to make passports  --  I joined to take scalps . " Hood glared at Mayo . " Well , I get the message . I 'm on my own . " " That 's not true , " said Mayo . " We need you . " " Prove it , " said Hood . " Tell me something I do n't know . Tell me why they 're stalling . " " They 're not stalling , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and Hood read evasion on her back . " Yes , they are , " he said . " You 're trying to protect them . They 're supposed to be so efficient , but as soon as I saw Brodie I knew they were a bunch of amateurs . Professionals do n't risk a whole campaign by sending a kid like that to do the dirty work  --  and Murf has the political judgment of a tuna fish . No , they 're beginners  --  like you with your painting . Sure , it 's a nice painting , but you 're the only one who thinks so . You 're wasting your time . All these secrets , all this waiting  --  tomorrow , next week , next year . It means one thing : they do n't know what they 're doing . They 've got no skill , so they 've got no nerve . And you want me to believe there 's some big secret ! Honey , I know their secret  --  they 're incompetent . They 're stupid . They 're stalling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Val , " said Mayo . " There 's going to be an English offensive . In terms of headlines , one bomb in Oxford Street is worth ten in Belfast . " " They 've got a plan , " he said . Their opiates were plans , plots , counterplots , circular stratagems , this drugged sentry duty to which they attached importance . Threat and plot replaced action , the motions of militant bureaucracy blinded them to the fact that they had no power . But they were satisfied with the self-flattery of their secrets , like addicts sucking a pipe of smoking promises . " Well , they have n't got me. "  | " Do n't say that . If you leave I 'll be blamed . I told them we could trust you . " " Did they need you to say that ? " " You 're an American . You were in the State Department .

" " Maybe I will . " " And another thing , " said Hood . " Tell them I know they 're stalling . They 've got a plan . Big deal  --  a plan is just a piece of paper , or in their case one Guinness too many . Any drunk can have a plan . There 's only one thing to do and that 's act . What are they waiting for ?

" " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something to do with supplies . All the contacts were made  --  that 's why they needed the passport . They think they 've been burned . " " Supplies , " said Hood . " You 're talking about hardware . What about their supply lines ? What kind of mob is this ? " " This is n't America , Val . We do n't buy machine guns at the local ironmonger 's . We have to get them on the continent  --  from Arabs , thugs , anyone . Then they have to get them into the country . It 's bloody hard . " " You 're wrong , sister . It 's easy , " said Hood . " Just send one of those creeps around here and I 'll tell him how . "  | " You 're so belligerent all of a sudden , " said Mayo . " You 've got all the answers , have n't you ? Well , I saw that room full of stuff upstairs . What do you propose to do with your twenty television sets ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mayo shrugged , but the talk had rattled her ; she started out of the room . Hood said , " And what do you propose to do with your painting ? " " I do n't want to think about it , " she said . " I 'll be sorry if they pay your ransom , " he said . " I 'm beginning to like it . " The painting 's secret had been revealed slowly . It had changed from day to day , from week to week , and now nearly a month since he first saw it the image had set . It was definite . He had seen Rogier as confused , furious , hesitant , holy , insane ; one day the thin smile was mocking , the next day it was benign , then it was not a smile at all but a mouth mastering pain . It was the portrait of a fabulous villain in black . It was a patrician gentleman gleaming with wealth . It was an anxious bridegroom pausing at the window of experience . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man suffering an obscure martyrdom , his soul shining in his face . Hood gave it titles : " The Expelled Consul , " " The Jailer Lord , " " The Hangman , " " Death Eating a Cracker . " One time it was not a man at all ; he 'd had an opium dream in which it was revealed as a woman , slender , like a heron in black , with small breasts , hungering in a high attic  --  the onset of loneliness , the moment of widowhood . All these , then none of these . The legs were apart , the boots planted almost athletically on the square of carpet ; the arms were rising on the handle of a silver dagger , the eyes were awakened with fury and pricked by the red light of imagination . The neck was tensed to turn , the hands to fight . It was the instant between decision and movement , a split second of calm . It was , passionately , a man of action . " You 're bourgeois to like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it , " he said . " A real revolutionarywould have burned it weeks ago . " For Mayo it was proof of her commitment , and when Hood challenged her with doing nothing she said , " At least I 've got the picture , " using the theft to seek exemption . Hood said , " Right . You 're stuck with it . " She did not see that it was purely theatrical , the dramatic flourish of a well-publicized burglary . But incomplete , a hollow gesture , since there had been no word from the owners , no further response from the newspapers . The sanctimonious warnings had ceased , the aggrieved art critic who had called it " a national treasure " was silent . The loss was accepted ; its last mentions had the serene factuality of obituaries . And none of Mayo 's demands had been met . The reward offered was laughable and would barely have covered the cost of reframing it . There was not much more that could be done with it . The frayed bottom edge had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean cutting into the painting itself , slashing the finished work . Mayo appeared unwilling to do this , and Hood knew that he would prevent her from damaging it . She had threatened in one of her letters to burn it . He reminded her of that threat , but hoped she would n't do it . It seemed more valuable to him now than anything he had ever known ; it calmed him to have that masterpiece of action in the house , the reassurance of a perfect man ; and it filled him with resolve , like a summoning trumpet . She kept it tacked to the wall of the bedroom cupboard , her trophy , regarding it with embarrassed pride . Hood noticed her standing before it , inhaling it , growing hostile in a glum way , as if she saw nothing in it but a man . The image did not move her ; the painting itself mattered . It was hers . Her attitude , then , was one of simple ownership : possessing it somehow bore witness to her dedication , enhanced her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ignore whatever remained of the plot . To steal money was a crime ; to steal a million pounds ' worth of art was a political act . She was no ordinary thief . Once she had looked at the self-portrait and said , " It 's butch . "  |p106Butch  ! Hood came to despise that in her ; how casually she acknowledged the painting , with what pompous certainty she spoke of the future . The painting taught him all he knew about her . She said nothing about her family , who , Hood guessed , must be wealthy  --  they had left that mark on her , or rather no mark at all , but an absence of blemish which was itself vivid as a scar . The impression she gave was one of aggressive independence , as if she had simply arrived . She gave no hint of preparation ; no doubt , hardly a motive , only the smug certitude that anything was possible . It was a snobbery of assurance Hood had seen in the rich , an awareness of power : what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or stolenPI without blame , or killed . Privilege : only the powerful knew the enemy ; but they had no true enemies , they could not be touched . The poor might suspect a threat but their world was outside Rogier 's window , a confusion of the unseen . Mayo , Lorna : he compared them and made his choice . The house on Albacore Crescent was a family , parents and children ; the television , the kitchen , the bedroom . Hood had , in a modest way , supervised Brodie and Murf ; and he had gone to bed when Mayo had , obeying a kind of marital signal , looking to her for sexual encouragement , the unspoken suggestion thatdi meant they would make love . " I 'm tired " or " I 'm not tired . " He had lingered , and finally he sat up reading and let her go to bed alone , penalizing her by pretending not to understand the hints that familiarity made obscure . She had n't insisted on sex . By mutual agreement he slept with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , relaxing as if unlocked with his blunt key . Then his feeling lapsed . He said nothing . These days , Mayo went to bed alone . Murder had brought him to the widow . He now visited her out of a cautious curiosity ; and , afraid of giving her false hope , he kept his distance . The guilt he saw in her intensified his own . He regretted that . He did not want to think that in killing Weech he had done anything but rescue his victims  --  andp107Lorna was one of them . The murder was an act of preservaon. tion . But with Mayo 's refusal to bring him into the plot , and with her objections to the cache of loot in the room  --  fear again : he did not want her to know of the arsenal  --  he turned more and more to Lorna . He had been treating her for her unspecific grief , a drug for her guilty anger . He liked her company , then he preferred it to Mayo 's ; and finally he needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the drug itself , and dreaded wounding her with his love . " Put the kid to bed , " he said one afternoon . " He wo n't go , " said Lorna . " He wants to go out . " " Ca n't you do something with him ? " " In the way , is he ? Look , if he gets on your nerves you do n't have to come round here . " " My nerves ? What about yours ? " " I 'm stuck with him , " she said , and Hood could see that everything she had feared in her husband she hated in the child , who was the brute , blameless in miniature . " He should be in school . I see kids his size going to school . It 's September  --  they 've started already . " " Playgroup , " said Lorna . " He 'd like it . " Hood said , " Then send him . " " Just like a Yank , " she said . " You never think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension . I ca n't afford things like playgroups . " " They 'd let him in free if they knew that . " " I 'm not a beggar . " Hood took out his wallet . He said , " How much ? " " I do n't want your money . " " Please take it , " said Hood . " You can pay me back . " " Stuff it . " " Do n't talk to me like that , " he said angrily . " Understand ? Do n't say that to me . " It was the first time Hood had ever raised his voice with her . He was sorry ; she looked scared : she had known other threats.  | " I 'm not giving you the money . I 'm giving it to him . " Jason lay on the floor , playing happily . An uncommon sight ; usually he screamed for his mother 's attention when Hood was around . Hood saw him as he saw the mother , through the narrow aperture of pity . He called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a playgroup , sonny ? " " No , " said Jason , wrinkling his nose . " I want to do a shit on your head . " He laughed a crass adult laugh . " Ron was sarky like that , " said Lorna . " Look , " said Hood to the boy , " you want to go to a playgroup . I know you do , so take this "  --  he gave the boy a five-pound note  --  " give it to the lady and you can go . " " Keep digging , " said Lorna . " It costs twelve quid . " It rained the next day , a heavy downpour ending a week of sun and dropping autumn on to that part of London , chilling the trees and darkening the brickwork of the angular terraces and washing all the traces of summer away . Where there was green , as in the park on Brookmill Road , it was sodden and depleted ; and the city looked smaller and fragmented in the mist  --  it was a sea of sinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the collar and trudged around the corner to Lorna 's . She said , " I knew you 'd be over today . " Hood entered and , opening his coat , took out a paper bag that was flecked with rain . " What 's that ? " " I 'm going to do some cooking . " The house was cold and unusually quiet ; the toys were put away ; he could hear the clock ticking in the kitchen . He looked across the parlor and said , " It 's a good place for him . He 'll like it . " " So will you . " " What makes you say that ? " She looked at him ; resignation tugged at her smile . " I know what you want . " Hood ignored her and opened the paper bag . He took out ap109thick blackened pipe , some tweezers , a candle , and a cigarette lighter . He pulled the cushions from the sofa and spread them on the floor ; and he squatted , setting out the simple apparatus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flat : " You 're going to do me . " Hood lit the candle and broke off a piece of opium . He took it with his tweezers and heated it in the flame . It sparked , then grew black , but it did not light . It thickened to a rounded blob and became glossy and then was encircled by fire . He said , " Lie down . " Lorna came near and sniffed . " What is it ? " She lay beside him , propping herself on a cushion . Hood took the pipe , poked the softened plug of opium inside and clicked the lighter over the hole . " Put it in your mouth , " he said , handing her the pipe . He told her how to puff it , and they passed it back and forth until the fragment was reduced to a coal . Then he scraped the bowl and started again . The candle lit her face , the flame giving her cat 's eyes : she was lovely , feline in this small light . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor smoking . She did it with her lips , holding the pipe stem tentatively , using her tongue , kissing the smoke , and he was half in love with her as the room filled with the aroma of sweltering poppies . They lay side by side , barely touching , breathing slowly ; they puffed the pipe and did not speak . He felt an urgent shudder , a dumb hilarity in his groin . Then it weakened and passed through him , warming him . There was thunder from the river , but the warehouses hid the lightning flashes . In the rain and opium smoke he smelled Hue , the fleeting gulp of a bobbing sampan . She was the first to sleep . He watched her as he prepared a fourth pipe , then he moved very close to her and kissed her still lips : they were cool with sleep . He puffed and closed his eyes and he was traveling to the drum and whine of a raga , an eastern lament , sorrowing for a love that was distant and danced like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already the dream had begun to roll.  |p110PITCHFORKED  AWAKE by a sharp pain in her back , Norah sat up in bed quickly , pushing at the mattress with her hands , making Mr. Gawber 's whole body leap . She switched on the bright bedside lamp , blinding her feebly inquiring husband , who turned and groaned . He lifted his pocket watch from the side table and swung it to his eye . It was just past eleven-thirty  --  he 'd had one hour 's sleep . Norah , motioning to stifle a sigh , managed to amplify it . She jerked on the bed , testing her back , drummed her legs and sighed again , drawing the noise slowly through a grievous scale , high to low , the sound of a person spinning down a deep shaft and never striking bottom , only whimpering at the end and growing into silence . They were both fully awake now , and in pajamas and nightdress , their hair fluffed into tangled white wigs , they looked blanched and ancient , whitened by frailty , two hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like noise . Norah said , " I ca n't sleep . " He pretended not to hear ; but how typical of her to wake him to tell him that ! She was no solitary sufferer . She demanded a witness , involved him in her discomfort , made him endure it . Invariably she touched him with her pain , and there was not an upset she 'd had that he had not somehow shared . She sighed , he groaned . It was in part the penalty of the double bed , marriage 's narrow raft . " Wake up , Rafie , I ca n't sleep . " " What is it ? " He exaggerated his drowsiness . " I feel ghastly . Yes , I think I 'm coming down with some/thing . " She tried her fingers , tasted her tongue , blinked  --  to locate symptoms . " Probably "  --  he yawned : a stage yawn , almost a pronouncement  --  " probably just wind . " " No , " she insisted . " I 've pins and needles . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She got a grip on her head and out of the corner of his eye Mr. Gawber saw her swivel it . She looked as if she might be trying to unscrew it . " Leave your head alone . You 'll just make it worse . " " I 'm feverish . " " Poor thing . " Without wishing to he yawned again , an authentic rebuke . " You do n't care . " She started to cry softly . " Oh , my head . It wo n't stop . " He said , " I believe you 're coming down with something . " " It 's flu , " she said and was calm . She listed her symptoms once more . " I 'm not surprised . There 's a lot of it around . Thornquist was out all last week . " He wanted to be sympathetic , but Norah 's illnesses were always so laborious that it annoyed him to hear her complain of their annoyance . He resisted consoling her . Then her aches and pains gave him some satisfaction  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By a queer process of reversal , charity made antagonistic , he came to enjoy hearing her say how it hurt . The bright lamp knocked against his eyes . He said , " Do turn the light off . " " How can I find my medicine in the dark ? " She thumped the mattress again , bouncing him , and went to the bathroom , switching on lights . She returned with a bottle of Doctor Collis Browne 's Mixture . It was an old bottle , containinga fluid now unlawfully potent , the active ingredient being opium . She was a regular user of patent medicines and pills : green lung tonic , fruit drops , stinging ointments , syrup of figs ,  |p112dragees  that stained her tongue purple . She was troubled by wind ; she took iron for her blood . Old ailments , old cures . She measured the Collis Browne into a soup spoon and sucked it noisily . " Do you a world of good , " Mr. Gawber muttered . Norah lay panting . Mr. Gawber reached across and turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alert , panic preventing sleep . Perhaps it would happen like this , a fiscal cramp that could n't be unknotted with a dose of the old mixture ; a sickening for which there was no name or cure ; a fever that could n't be shaken off . The workers all down with something , brokers with their fingers badly burned , industry halted at a stage of senility , a hardening in the usually swift canals , blockage , and the old country supine , helpless on her back like he himself in a ridiculous parody of repose . He found his small radio and put in his earplug . He moved the dial . Radio Three had gone off the air . He spun the wheel to the World Service . He heard , . . . let no starDelude us  --  dawn is very far . This is the tempest long foretold  --  Slow to make head but sure to hold . Stand by ! The lull ' twixt blast and blast Signals the storm is near , not past ; And worse than present jeopardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture , favorite of puzzle-setters . Mr. Gawber passed the night like this , worrying about England as if she were a dear old aunt in failing health , and not whether or how soon the death would come , but how she would look , laid out among her indifferent mourners . The medical analogy he knew to be fanciful , and Kipling 's " Storm Cone " was romance . Whenever he thought of the catastrophe ahead one imagep113remained in his mind : the war . He had n't fought , yet he had felt it keenly . It was a dark brown newsreel in his memory he could run at any time , and that flicker from the past was a flicker of the future . Powdered eggs , rationed sweets , sugar coupons , bread queues , the occasional bombed building in the middle of a terrace , like a missing tooth in a wonky denture ; books printed illegibly on villainous paper , the brave voice of Churchill on the steam radio and the officious Mr. Mullard from number twenty-nine over the road  --  and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tea , the sizzle of snoek , the sound of buzz bombs . War ! It had shaped him . He remembered it on this long night with a certain cheer , because the war had helped him to find in himself an access of strength . He was not afraid . Still Norah snored , and dayspring  --  who said that ?  --  dayspring was mishandled . The traffic began on Catford Hill , and on Volta Road the clank of the bottles in the milk float , the grinding front gates , the plunk of the letter slot . And the September sun  --  for once he was glad dawn came early . He went down , made tea , and brought Norah a cup . She slept as if she had been coshed , bludgeoned there on her half of the raft : her mouth was open and she sprawled face up , ventilating her sinuses with rattling snores . He woke her gently . She blinked and smacked her lips and said , " I had a dreadful night . " He was silent at breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters , the obituaries . An item on the front page shocked him . " You know what that means , do n't you ? " Norah said. . . . unclothed and partly decomposed body , he 'd seen . Why did they print such things , and which ghouls read them ? He folded the paper and said , " What 's that , my dear ? " " I wo n't be able to go to the play . " Indecent  --  worse : hideous . He saw the body and tasted it on his toast . " What play is that ? " " Tea for Three , " said Norah . " I was so looking forward to it . "  |p114I  hunt too ? How trivial and sour the title seemed over breakfast . He said , " I 'd completely forgotten about it . You night he feeling better tonight . I must say , I 'm feeling a bit off . That 's enough breakfast for me . " " I wo n't enjoy it . It wo n't be the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You ca n't do that . It 's a gift  --  Miss Nightwing will be terribly upset . She was counting on us to go . " " But what will I do with the extra ticket ? " " You can take someone from the office . Miss French . " " The inevitable Miss French . " " One of the clerks . Mr. Thornquist . They 'd be glad of a chance . And you can tell me all about it . " " Are you sure you ca n't go ? " " Rafie , I feel ghastly . I have this rotten feeling in my stomach  --  " She described it with disgusting care , checking Mr. Gawber 's reverie . Sick people knew their ailments so thoroughly . He clucked and tilted his head in concern ; he listened and felt a vengeful glee rising to his ears . He was ashamed , but even that did not diminish the pleasure of hearing her drone on about her stomach . She had deprived him of a night 's sleep . He promised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pan at Christmas . A penance  --  he would have to sit through two plays for her gastric flu . And she said she could n't face making his lunch . So the crush of a noontime pub as well . elbows and soapy beer and the prattling of loud clerks in the smoke . The catastrophe would finish them , but he wanted it soon . Sometimes he wished there were a chain he could pull to start the landslip quickly . " Why are you smiling ? " " I 'm not smiling . " Was he ? What did that mean ? " I 've got something stuck in my tooth . " " Is there anything in the paper ? " " No . " He left for work , glad to be free of the house , the stale air ofp115the sickroom . He crossed the frontier of the Thames and was restored by the rain-freshened air in the solider part of the city . He chose the Embankment route to the Aldwych , walking behind the Savoy , pausing at the statue of Arthur Sullivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the neat paths to the stairwell below Waterloo Bridge . The graffiti howled from the walls , unpronounceable madness and the threat that had become so frequent : ARSENAL RULE . Two homeless old men bumped their belongings down the stairs in prams , like demon nannies with infants smothered under teapots and ragged clothes . The men and their prams were secured with lengths of string . It was an omen : soon the whole population would be shuffling behind laden prams , crying woe . His reflection was interrupted by the tickets he had been lumbered with . Who to take ? In the course of the morning he worked through a short list . The receptionist yawned at him . Not her , in any case : people would talk . The messenger , Old Monty ? He had a room in a men 's hostel in Kennington . A clean man , he smelled of carbolic soap and was always speaking to Mr. Gawber of weevils and black beetles and how the other men never changed their shirts , and how they left the bathroom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Aldershot , Indian camps , Rangoon . " I should have stuck with the clarinet , " Monty said . He 'd enjoy a play . Mr. Gawber risked the question , but Monty said , " I always do my washing on Thursdays . " Rodney , the stockroom boy ? Rodney brought fresh pencils at eleven o'clock , but Mr. Gawber did n't like the way he dropped them on his desk , with a clatter that hurt his teeth . In such a careless gesture he saw the boy would resign one day soon . It was the pattern : they became clumsy , then they quit . Not Rodney . " Ask Ralph  --  ca n't you see I 'm busy ? " said Thornquist irritably waving a secretary away . And not Thonky . Sadly , the inevitable Miss French . But she said , when hep116approached her , " I hope you 're not going to ask me if those letters are typed . They 're all here , just as you gave them to me . I could n't read your writing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good uniform hand , sacrificing loops for a workmanlike clarity . The woman was lying . Not her . He picked up the phone and dialed . There was a buzz , a jumble of clicks , then , "  --  but if I sell now at thirty-three I 'll be out of pocket to the tune of four thousand . " " By tomorrow morning it will be five thousand , " said another voice . " Sell now , " said Mr. Gawber , and hung up. *Hood took out the business card and confirmed the Kingsway address , found the entrance and just inside on the wall the name Rackstraw 's on a column of varnished boards . He ran up the steps three at a time and met the receptionist who , with headphones at rest on her neck , was reading a magazine . " Mister Gawber , please . " The girl looked up from her magazine . " Do you have an appointment ? " " No . " " You 'll have to take a seat . " " I 'll stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he said , " You can tell him I 'm here . " " There 's someone ahead of you . " " I do n't see anyone , sweetheart . " " He 's got an appointment . He 's not here yet . " Now the girl was not reading , but simply holding her elbows out and flipping pages to avoid facing another question . " I wish you 'd do something . I 'm in a hurry . " " I 'm doing everything I can . " She did n't look up . " This is abusy office . Appointments only . That 's the rule . " She turnedpages quickly and shook her head . " I do n't make the rules . " An elderly man in a dark blue messenger 's uniform camep117through the outer door . He stopped at the desk and made a swift reflex with his heels . " That packet 's from Mister Thornquist , " said the girl crossly . " It was supposed to be delivered an hour ago to the City . By hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was doing the post . " " The post does n't take two hours , Monty . " " Parcels , " said the man . " They wanted weighing . " " Listen , Monty , that packet 's been sitting there  --  " " Back up , " said Hood striding over to the girl . She wasstartled . He said , " Why are you talking to him that way ? " " I 'm sorry but  --  " " Cut it out . Do n't use that tone with him . " The man stared . Hood said , " Do n't let her talk to you that way . " " Thank you , sir , " said the man . " I was just going to say that myself . " Hood turned again to the girl . " If I catch you giving him any lip I 'll come back here and slap your ass . " He walked past her to the office door . The girl stood up . " You do n't have an appointment . " " Move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl sat down and twisted her magazine in both hands . Hood marched through the office of typists quickly , saw a glassed-in cubicle in which Mr. Gawber was working at a desk , and headed for it . He knocked and went in . " Yes , yes , " said Mr. Gawber rising , trying to remember the name . " Valentine Hood . " " Exactly , " said Mr. Gawber . " I never forget a face . I should be royalty or a tax inspector or a politician . Cursed with total recall ! Lower Sydenham  --  about six weeks ago  --  and your friend . " He tapped his forehead . " It 's gone  --  what was his name ? But his face is there , oh his face is there ! " " He was n't a friend of mine , " said Hood . " Of course not . Nasty piece of work , was n't he ? " Mr.p118Gawber made passes with his hands . " Now do have a seat  --  what can I do for you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever had a financial problem I should come to you " Mr. Gawber listened with apprehension . He took a pencil and holding it like a cricket bat said , " I 'd like to interrupt you before you go any further . I might have given you the wrong impression . We 're mainly a firm of accountants , which means we do n't handle loans or mortgages . Some people think  --  and I do n't blame them one bit  --  that we 're bankers . " He batted with the pencil . " Chap was in here last week , sitting where you are now . Tradesman , I imagine . Awfully nice chap . Wanted some cash . Had to tell him he 'd got the wrong end of the stick . Bowled ! " Mr. Gawber studied the pencil he had been batting with . " He was terribly creased . There are-so many misconceptionsabout this business . " " I did n't come here for a loan , " said Hood . " I 'm so glad you said that . " " Mine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure an accountant should have the answer . " " I could n't agree more . " " I 'd like your advice on transferring money to another person 's account without that person knowing where it came from . " Mr. Gawber leaned forward , as if he had n't quite heard the proposal . He had heard , but a detail bothered him : when a man said " person " he always meant a woman . " I owe this person some money , " Hood went on , " and the person will be offended if I just hand it over  --  pride , I suppose . The only solution is to transfer it . From an unknown source , as they say . " " How much is outstanding ? " " A lot , I 'm afraid . But I 'd like to transfer it in installments , a certain amount every week . " " Does this , um , person have a bank account ? " " Yes , " said Hood.  | " Then it 's really quite simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they handle these things in your country , but here  --  apart from Coutts , lovely old firm  --  banks do n't specify the source of funds on the statements anymore . The money comes in , it 's credited , and that 's the end of it . There might be a deposit notice , though  --  a chit through the post . Your name might appear on that . " " Or yours . " " If we acted for you . " " It would simplify things , " said Hood . " I could n't agree more , " said Mr. Gawber . " Now if you give me the name of the young lady 's bank and the account number  --  " " I did n't say it was a young lady . " " Of course you did n't ! " Mr. Gawber blushed and he rubbed his eyes in embarrassment . " Why did I think that ? I 'm terribly sorry  --  you must forgive me . " Hood smiled . " No problem . It 's a young lady , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's on the bottom . " He unfolded the check he had torn from a book in Lorna 's handbag . " Weech , " said Mr. Gawber , examining the check . " That rings a bell . I 'm good on faces , but so bad on names . Should I know her ? " " No , " said Hood , and attempted to distract Mr. Gawber with the details of his own account . Mr. Gawber wrote on a pad . He said , " Very odd . I hope you do n't think I always go canvassing for new accounts in the public houses of Lower Sydenham . That was my first time in the area . A little mix-up . But I told you , did n't I ? It started with a crossed line on that telephone . Had another . one this morning . But what an extraordinary day that was . I suppose you 've forgotten all about it . " Hood said , " I 'd better be going . " But Mr. Gawber did n't want him to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now he recalled the other fellow , ap120tough rowdy man whose every word had alarmed him . Hood had not been afraid  --  he had stood between them and given Mr. Gawber a kind of protection . He was tired now . That night 's sleep lost . Norah was paying for her disruption , but he needed someone , a little company . Alone , depressed , he would think only of the catastrophe . He said , to stall Hood , " No , you 're absolutely right . " " I 'm off , " said Hood . " No , I could n't agree more , " said Mr. Gawber . He doodled on his pad . " We 'll have to tighten our belts , like everyone else . " Hood rose and backed to the door of the cubicle . He said , " I 'll write you a letter to make it official . " " You 're not going so soon ? " " I 'm wasting your time . " " Not at all  --  I 'm enjoying our little talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tea . I 'm sorry I ca n't offer you anything stronger . " Tea : he remembered . " I say , Mr. Hood , do you have any plans for this evening ? "  |p121LIKE  FILING INTO CHURCH , but the wrong one . Mr. Gawber felt very tired and wayward , and he paused with Hood in front of the theater deliberately to anger himself . The critics ' praise was displayed like gospel verses on a Baptist motto-board , calling doubtful people in : I LAUGHED TILL I CRIED  --  THAT RARITY , A SHEER DELIGHT  --  RELIEF FROM THESE DARK TIMES  --  I BEG YOU TO SEE IT !  --  THE SADDER MOMENTS ALSO RING TRUE  --  IT DESERVES TO RUN AND RUN  --  A SHATTERING ACHIEVEMENT  --  I DID N'T WANT IT TO END ! He knew there was even an organ inside , flanked by boxes that might have held choristers . The lobby had all the carpets and brass of a presbytery , and there glassy-eyed people smoked , chattering excitedly , searching faces-for friends , a commotion of tentative greeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the doors to the stalls . The people passed by them , entered the theater  --  a stupendous hollow temple trimmed with pagan gilt  --  and dropped their voices to whispers . They shuffled down the aisles pinching their stubs : an attitude of somberness that was almost stately . Church-going for them , too , but they were reverential . Mr. Gawber bought a pound of chocolates . It was habit . He excused himself and fell into that queue as soon as he arrived . He tucked them under his arm , and picking up the tickets at the box office  --  a slight thrill seeing his name importantly lettered on the envelope  --  led Hood to the seats . They were down front , so near to the footlights they could hear the mutters of stagehands behind the curtain pushing furniture into position . Then Mr. Gawber sat with the box of Black Magic on his lap , wearing an expression of extreme anxiety , as if he expected thep122place to catch fire at any moment ; or a bombing ? Public places had become terrorists ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain . It was more than discomfort  --  it was a rapture of fear on his face so keen it could have been mistaken for joy . " Looks like a full house , " said Hood , and saw Mr. Gawber 's grasp tighten on the chocolates . Allowing the old man to escort him , Hood had experienced a son 's cozy serenity . Mr. Gawber had acted with polite conviction , almost gallantry , steering Hood down the Aldwych , occasionally warning him about pickpockets , and apologizing in advance for the play he promised would be appalling . But Mr. Gawber had said little else . His guidance was unobtrusive  --  paternal nods that were helpful and mild and with a hint of pride . He was like the father who remains silent because so much is understood ; and Hood was relieved that no brightness was demanded of him . He had been unwilling to go to the play , but he had nothing better to do , and Mr. Gawber had shyly insisted : " I 'd consider it a great favor . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paint , he felt he had stumbled into an anonymous pause , outside time , like a formal reverie which would leave him empty . He expected nothing of the play but for it to end . The mutterings from behind the curtain grew louder , the bump of furniture quickened , and the curtain itself bulged on the backs of the stagehands . There was a crash and a muffled cry : " Balls ! " " This is the part I like , " said Mr. Gawber . Hood glanced at him , puzzled . He wondered if the old man was cracked . The curtain had not risen . Mr. Gawber relaxed and clasped his freckled hands . It happened again , porkers ' grunts preceding a wooden thud that made the hem of the curtain dance . " Forgive me , " said Mr. Gawber , shaking with laughter . He snorted into his handkerchief . He was enjoying himself now , his look of fear replaced by a cheery appreciation of the random bangings . This , for him , was the only comedy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silencing the murmurs in the audience and bringing a hush like piety . The curtain went up on a modern kitchen the width of the stage , as efficient-looking as an operating room , with chrome and bright fittings and a muted yellow decor . Sunbeams leaned against the windows . A large stove , a refrigerator the size of a wardrobe and a series of oblong cupboards at eye level , one with its door open revealing shelves crammed with cans of food : there was a gasp of approval from the audience . On counters that ran between the appliances and on a table at the center , the cooking paraphernalia had been set out spice jars , bowls , a pitcher of milk , an electric blender , copper pots and whisks , ingredients in cartons , and a varnished firkin labeled Flour . " That 's the kind I want , " said a woman behind Mr. Gawber , biting on a chocolate wafer . " Looks awfully expensive , " said the man next to her . " But there 's masses of working surfaces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that a gas cooker ? " " Electric , " said Mr. Gawber softly to himself . A red light flashed on the back panel of the stove and a loud buzzer rang . It rang continuously in the empty kitchen and after a minute of this piercing sound a ripple of mirth  --  embarrassed , expectant , then confident  --  ran through the audience , responding to the buzz . This unattended signal , mimicking rage , went on for another few minutes , causing hoots and finally shouts of laughter . At the side of the stage a door opened and a woman in an apron rushed across the kitchen . She was recognized by the audience and applauded . She acknowledged this with a small girl 's pout . She was a plump slouching woman with heavy arms , brittle make-up , stiff blue hair and a drooping mouth . She wore bracelets that flopped and tinkled above the sound of the buzzer . She glared at the noise , making impatient passes with her hands.  | " Blanche Very , " said Mr. Gawber . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her as Ophelia at the Hippodrome in Catford . That 's going back a few years . " The buzz droned on . Blanche Very took a wooden spoon from a counter and whacked the control panel , magically stopping it . This sent the audience into peals of laughter . The hilarity depressed Hood ; and Mr. Gawber sat with his mouth fixed in a grim bite . Blanche Very drew on a pair of thick red mittens , then peeked through the window of the stove and groaned  --  more laughter : it was abrasive and forced  --  and pulled the oven door open , releasing a tremendous cloud of black smoke . " Knickers ! " she cried , bringing out a tray of burned scones . The audience was now hysterical and a woman sitting near Hood was stamping her feet and wiping her eyes and nearly gagging with croaks of merriment . " It 's her timing , " said Mr. Gawber . " Ca n't see it myself , but there it is . " For the next several minutes Blanche Very measured and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banged about the kitchen , making each busy gesture into casual blundering and repeating it when she raised a laugh . At one point she opened a cupboard , revealing another assortment of food , impressive for the size of the packages and the way it was stacked , from top to bottom . There was a significant hush in the audience at the sight of it that did not quite conceal an envious hunger.  --  Now let 's see here . Baby 's Bottom Muffins . ' That 's it . She worked from a hefty cookbook , which she held up in one hand and read slowly , satirizing the recipe by giving it a Shakespearean stress and intonation . As she spoke the side door opened and a man came in . He wore slippers , clenched a newspaper in his shaking hands , and puffed a pipe . He was recognized and applauded . " Dick Penrose , " said Mr. Gawber . " They 're married . I mean , in real life . Though Norah says it 's touch and go . " Penrose winked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head and hands was not for comic effect but rather an elderly twitching that was uncontrollable . It was as if he were being pelted with rain . He shook and walked arthritically , fooling with his paper , blowing on his pipe . Like the woman , he was dressed and made up to look more youthful than he was . The program notes described them as " a childless couple in early middle age , perhaps forty , " but their pinkness was powder . Hood saw two old people in clown 's masks.  --  Did you call me , love ?  --  No , I said knickers . ' I 've burned the scones . They looked like pieces of coal.  --  Save them . Might come in handy this winter when the miners are on strike and the Arabs are squeezing our assets . There were bawls of appreciation , and even scattered clapping , for this . " Right , " said Hood . " I 've seen enough . I 'm leaving . " He hitched forward and started to rise . But Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , holding the pound of chocolates on his lap , like a train passenger in a tunnel . His posture was attentive ; only his eyes , tightly shut , indicated his slumber.  --  Speaking of Arabs . Hear about the one that was trying to get back ? Goes into an airline booking office and hands over a hundred quid for his ticket . Feller at the desk says You 're ten pee short . ' So this Arab walks outside and stops a City gent . May I have ten pee , sir ? I want to go back to Arabia . ' Here 's a pound , ' says the gent , take nine more of the buggers with you . ' Hood folded his arms angrily . There was some business with the electric blender . The woman left the top off and switching it on sent the mixture flying in blobs that plastered the kitchen and shot into their faces . The jokes were about food  --  the shortage of sugar , the cost of flour , the hoarding of butter ; and the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Three weeks on the Costa Packet . Is n't it smashing to be back ? Imagine , a cup of tea without grease in it !  | And no enterovioform for dessert anymore.  --  Blimey , they even put garlic in the corn flakes.  --  Was n't it shocking ? Why did we do it ?  --  Perversion , that 's Europe . But I 've been looking forward to this . High tea . Good English food after all that Spanish muck . Mr. Gawber swayed in sleep . Hood was restive ; the stupid happy faces of the audience , the idiocy onstage , the gaping at food , the ineffectual humor put him in a mood of the sharpest rage . He could destroy them for this fooling . They were acting out their strength , celebrating their petty hatred . But the worst of this malice was the acceptance of things as they were , the assumption of oily foreigners , the assumption of greed , the assumption of funny little England . That and the moronic display of food stacked , burned , thrown about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it as the coarsest pornography  --  hunger 's greedy ridicule . He wanted to wake up Mr. Gawber and tell him he was going ; he could wait in the lobby until it was over . And he had half-risen to leave when the boy made his appearance onstage  --  a handsome boy in an old army shirt and woolen cap and boots.  --  You mean , while we were in Majorca you were sleeping in the garage ?  --  Yeah . I 'm a squatter.  --  Spanish style ? Well , there 's a time and place for that . He means he 's moved in.  --  He can bloody well move out . He 'll rust me mower.  --  You ca n't throw me out like that . Anyway , maybe I can help . Hood sat down . The boy , unseen by the man , winked at the woman , who was obviously attracted to him . The man gave in and allowed the boy to help with the dishes . This was the beginning of a prolonged and punning flirtation , with winks for emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed at the farce the woman made of the cooking and barked at the sexual innuendo . But Hood was looking closely at the boy , studying the face , the ears , the set of the mouth.  |p127The  woman tossed a bowl into the sink , splashing and soaking the boy 's shirt.  --  Oh , I 'm terribly sorry . You 're drenched  --  That 's okay . It 'll dry.  --  Here , take that off Ca n't have you catching cold.  --  I 'll get you one of my shirts . Wo n't be any worse than the one you 're wearing . The man plucked at the boy 's shirt , but the boy objected and covered himself . The man snatched and with fumbling fingers worked at the buttons . He opened the wet shirt and shook loose two well-developed breasts , nodding softly in his astonishedface . That was the end of the first act . Mr. Gawber woke and smiled . He said , " Disappointing . " " Who did you say the girl was ? " " Araba Nightwing . Client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play Peter Pan in the Christmas pantomime . " " I 'd like to meet her . " " Would you ? " Mr. Gawber seemed surprised . " I can arrange that . It 's the least I can do after putting you through this . We 'll go backstage afterward . But I think it 's only fair to say that her company can be rather , um , frenzied . How about a tub of ice cream ? " He hailed a woman passing with a tray and bought two ice creams . He gave one to Hood and said , " Or more than frenzied , if there 's a word for it . It 's the profession , you know . All that publicity . Money . Then unemployment . It does things to them . They never stop acting  --  it 's very trying . They cry and it 's not sad . They laugh and you wonder why . I 'd applaud if only they 'd stop , but they take it as encouragement . Norah loves them , poor old thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Big puppets , of course . " " The Japanese have them , " said Hood , digging at the ice cream . " You do n't say , " said Mr. Gawber . " I thought it was my own invention . Big puppets , absolutely lifelike . I 'd feel betterp128about it . It would n't be so embarrassing somehow . " " It 's a good idea . " There was a thump behind the curtains . Mr. Gawber laughed . " Oh , I say ! " Hood said , " I hate this play . " " Then we shall go , " said Mr. Gawber , crushing his empty ice cream cup and shifting in his seat . " No , " said Hood , " I want to meet that actress . " " She 's got quite a reputation . " The warning bells rang at intervals of a minute and then the lights dimmed , the chatter ceased , and the curtain rose . Mr. Gawber went to sleep at once . The second act was a reversal of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tight-fitting dress . The woman was angry . The man flirted . There were whispers.  --  She 'll have to go.  --  But you wanted her to stay !  --  That was when she was a boy.  --  But you 've got to admit she knows how to cook . The cooking , the preparations for tea , had gone on . The woman made mistakes ; it was the girl who made the cakes , the scones , the kippers and poached eggs . This amazed and delighted the audience : cakes baked before their eyes , an egg poached on stage , the scones brought steaming from the oven . The food was theater . A little cheer went up each time a new item appeared and was set out on the table . And it was the cooking that won the woman over . At the end of the play they sat around the table , the woman champing on a cake , the man leering , the girl looking at once seductive and demure.  --  We dreamed about this in Spain.  --  A real English tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  No garlic.  --  And a bit of crumpet.  | " Awfully disappointing , " said Mr. Gawber , blinking as the curtain came down . There were five curtain calls , and then the audience was depleted , but smiling in the glare of lights . They filed out with mincing stateliness , as they had entered . Hood noticed how fat and satisfied they looked , repeating the lines of the play with sleek self-assurance , laughing through downturned mouths in hearty agreement . At the stage door Mr. Gawber said , " I feel such a jackass doing this . " Hood said , " I 'll ask for her . " A porter in a peaked cap said , " Help you ? " " We 're looking for Miss Nightwing . " " Come in . I think she 's still inside , " said the porter . He spoke to another man . " Has she turned in her key ? " The other man , at the window of a booth just inside the door , glanced up at a board on which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not here . She must be changing . " An old man walked towards them , carrying a leather satchel . He moved slightly stooped and his head shook . He wore a thin brown overcoat and a small trilby hat . His face was deeply wrinkled and pale and he looked very tired as he passed and handed a key to the man in the narrow booth . " Night , George . " " Night , Mister Penrose . Mind how you go . " Mr. Gawber whispered , " Dick Penrose . " He saw the old actor struggle with the door and pull his satchel through , and he thought : Poor old fellow , he must be seventy . He felt a tug of pity seeing the actor alone , so exhausted , stepping into a damp wind gusting from Drury Lane . He had never seen an actor after a performance , and he could not separate the two men in his mind . He watched the battered door , sorrowing for the man , then turned to face Araba Nightwing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Gawber ! " She held him tightly and sobbed.  | " This is my friend . Mister Hood , I 'd like you to meet Miss Nightwing . " Araba 's crying ceased . She smiled at Hood . Suddenly she said , " Your wife  --  what 's happened to her ! " " Under the weather , I 'm afraid . A bout of flu . Nothing serious . " " I was going to suggest a drink , " said Hood . " God , I need one , " said Araba . She wiped at her tears and wiped away that mood . She gave her key to the man in the booth and they started through the door . There was a shout from the hallway . " Has my old man ditched me again ? " The speaker was a short fat woman with a face the color of plaster . The voice was Blanche Very 's and she was still shouting as the stage door banged shut . They went up Catherine Street to the Opera Tavern , Araba wrapped in a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeating how kind it was of Mr. Gawber to have come to the play . She did not speak to Hood directly , and it was not until they were in the pub and seated under the old theater posters and signed photographs that he was able to get a good look at her face . The shine , the pinkness she 'd had in the play , was gone  --  that mask was off  --  but there remained traces of the make-up flecking her long cheeks . She was tall , with large perfect features forming true angles and sloping planes which , because they fit so exactly , did not give the impression of largeness . She had the sort of beauty that is at once familiar and strange , a remembered face , full of clues . Her lips were full and she spoke emphatically without noticeable effort , but with an anger she had n't used in the play . The scarf she 'd wrapped tightly on her head in imitation of the great Twenties actress she was often compared to , hid her hair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of a desert princess . But it was her eyes that struck Hood  --  they were green , and she seemed to be able to intensify their light to give a point to her words . She still spoke to Mr. Gawber  --  he was jammed against thep131wall  --  but she watched Hood with those green eyes , studying him closely , almost suspiciously . " Sometimes I do n't think I can bear it a minute more . It 's such a fag , and there 's a matinee on Wednesdays . I do n't know how I do it  --  I have to suck sweets to keep awake . It 's dreadful . " " You seemed to be enjoying yourself , " said Hood . " I am an actress , " said Araba . " Yes , the play was very interesting , " said Mr. Gawber . " Interesting ? " she said , using her voice to doubt it . " No one 's ever said it was that . " She addressed Hood . " What did you think of it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Hood . " The audience seemed to like it , though . " " I do n't want to talk about them , " said Araba . " We 've heard your good news , " said Mr. Gawber . " About Peter Pan . " " It was the boy-girl part in this thing that did it . It 's just a gimmick . Peter Pan is a big play  --  I wonder if you know how big ? I hate some of the audiences , so many queers think of it as their own vehicle . I 'm only doing it for the kids . They understand it  --  they go out hating their parents . That 's how it should be . God , I love acting for kids ! They really appreciate what you do for them . They do n't have any hangups . They 're terrible critics  --  if they think it 's a lot of old rope they say so ; if they feel like screaming , they scream . I love that . " They were seated near the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time young men with blow-waves and back-combed hair , and girls peeking from beneath widebrimmedhats , had called out " Araba " and " Darling . " Araba had smiled and gone on talking about acting for children ( " There 's no ego-trip involved  --  they 're not interested in stars and personalities " ) . Now they were approached by a short woman pushing through the crowd , holding a small dog Hood had first taken for a handbag  --  it was square and still , with tight curls . The woman had freckles on her thin face andp132chewed an empty cigarette holder . Under this veil of freckles the woman  --  who was no larger than a child  --  had the sly mocking face of an old elf . But there was about her size and the way she was dressed a neatness that was sharp and unconcealing : the small body showed through the green coat as the slyness had through the freckles . She said in a high voice , " Poldy wants to say hello . " She spoke to the dog : " Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  do n't just sit there . " " McGravy , I 'd like you to meet one of my dearest friends , Ralph Gawber . " Mr. Gawber said , " Very pleased to meet you . This is Mister Hood . " " Mister Hood is not a very good judge of plays , " said Araba . McGravy said , " Send him to Tea for Three . " " I just saw it , " said Hood . " What 's the verdict ? " said McGravy . Hood considered for a moment , then said , " It 's got a lot of food in it , has n't it ? " " It 's all about food , " said McGravy . " And that was one damned hungry audience . I could see them licking their chops . " " Everyone 's starving nowadays , " said McGravy , looking uncertainly at Hood , who was smirking . " It 'll get worse . " " I sometimes think that , " said Mr. Gawber . " It 's the system , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this deception . All these hangmen . And these leeches  --  bleeding people to death . It makes me want to throw up . " " Parasites , " said McGravy , cuddling her dog until hegrowled his affection . " Well , they 'll get what they deserve . " " I think that needs saying , " said Mr. Gawber . " Bloodsuckers , " said Araba . " It 's a Punch and Judy show , but it ca n't go on like this . " " I could n't agree with you more , " said Mr. Gawber . " It really is rotten , " said McGravy . " It 's like a boil that needs lancing  --  then it 'll all come gushing out , all the corruption and lies . "  | " I 'm so glad you said that , " said Mr. Gawber . He leaned forward , encouraged . Two hours of sleep in the theater had rested him . He said spiritedly , " No , the workers have had it all their own way since the war , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A period of recession would n't be a bad thing . A crash might even be better  --  dose of salts . I agree , unemployment 's a bitter pill , but the workers have to realize  --  " " Who 's talking about workers ? " said McGravy sharply in her high child 's voice . " Let him finish , sister , " said Hood . " Whose side are you on ? " McGravy demanded . Mr. Gawber said , " Are n't you talking about workers ? " " No , " said Araba , patting Mr. Gawber 's hand . " We 're talking about the power structure , my darling . " " But the unions , " said Mr. Gawber . " With all respect , there 's your power structure , surely ? " " The union leaders are in league with the government , " said McGravy . " It 's a plot  --  " " Dry up , " said Hood . " I had no idea , " said Mr. Gawber . " Let 's talk about the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Araba . " Wait , Araba . Perhaps he has some insight he wants to share with us . " " My insight , " said Hood , " is I think it 's the biggest waste of time since Parcheesi . " He smiled . " A load of crap . " " Come now , " said Mr. Gawber . He thought it tactless of Hood to say it , but all the same agreed and felt a greater fondness for him . " It made him mad , " said Araba . " It 's supposed to make him mad , " said McGravy . " But it is a wank , " said Araba . " If only it was , " said Hood . " I was sitting there and saying to myself , What 's the point ? ' " " If only he knew , " said McGravy , grinning at Araba.  | " What do n't I know ? " " Several things , " said Araba . " But the first one is that McGravy wrote it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've put your foot in it . " McGravy stroked her dog and let him nuzzle her . She turned to Hood . " You were saying ? " " Nothing , " said Hood . " Go on , I 'm rather enjoying your embarrassment . " " It 's not embarrassment , sister , and if you think I 'm worried about hurting your feelings , forget it . If you wrote that play you must be so insensitive you 're bulletproof . " " I wish I were , " said Araba . " Who are you anyway ? " said McGravy . " Just part of the audience , " said Hood . " Drink up , please , " said a man in a splashed smock , collecting empty glasses from the table . " I have a train to catch , " said Mr. Gawber . " Let 's get a coffee at Covent Garden , " said Araba to Mr. Gawber . " Then we 'll let you go home . " They trooped up to Covent Garden , turning left at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backing into fruit stalls at the market . There were men signaling directions with gloved hands , and behind them stacks of crates and displays of vegetables . In spite of the trucks it had for Hood the air of a bazaar  --  the dark shine of the cobblestones , the littered gutters and piles of decaying fruit ; the men jogging with boxes on their heads and others bent almost double under the weight of sacks . Mr. Gawber thought he saw the two men with the laden prams he 'd seen earlier that day in the stairwell below Waterloo Bridge ; he remembered the warning , ARSENAL RULE , and then actually saw it , splashed on the arches of Covent Garden Market . Over by the tea stall gaunt men stood inhaling the steam from cups of tea . " I love it here , " said Araba , whirling her cape open , performing . The men saw her and grinned . McGravy 's dog , lively for thep135first time , yapped at the tea drinkers . Mr. Gawber was uneasy : the men were wretched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Araba had bought four cups of coffee from the man in the stall  --  he had tattoos , and a torn singlet , and a hat folded from a sheet of newspaper  --  and she was handing them out . Mr. Gawber kicked the squashed fruit from his shoes . " They do n't treat you special here , " Araba said . " They 're real people . " But the men were gathering and muttering a little distance from her . In the half-light of the high lamps Mr. Gawber saw their faces as shadowy and criminal , and their eyes as thumbprintsof soot over whiskery cheeks . McGravy 's dog continued to howl at them . Hood said , " Your play . Both of you must be making a lot of money . " " It 's for a good cause , " said McGravy . Again she said to Araba , as she had in the Opera Tavern , " If only he knew . " " Let me guess your sign , " said Araba . " Aries . The Ram . Am I right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry , sweetheart . " " My actor clients are frightfully keen on horoscopes , " said Mr. Gawber . " They read their stars in the newspaper and get ever so excited . " Hood had not taken his eyes from Araba 's . He said , " Let me guess your passport number . " " How extraordinary , " said Mr. Gawber . " It begins with a Y. ' Seven digits . And it 's light blue  --  " " Ah , you 're mistaken , " said Mr. Gawber . " Bad luck . British passports are navy blue . " " This is an American passport , " said Hood . " That 's enough ! " cried Araba , and seeing her fury in the lamplight the men at the tea stall laughed . She gathered her cape , said good night to Mr. Gawber and walked away , making her exit between the great stacks of crated fruit.  |p139SHE  GOT OUT OF THE TAXI in Deptford High Street , lookedaround , and felt cheated . Then she walked to assess it , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she wondered if she had come to the right place . But she had : there were the signs . Deeply cheated , tricked by the map and her imagination . She had wanted to like it and had prepared herself for a complicatedriverfront slum with the kind of massive mirrored pubs she 'd passed on the Old Kent Road ; damp side lanes and blackened churches and brick-peaked Victorian schools containedby iron fences and locked gates ; with a quaint decrepitude , credibly vicious and with visible remnants of danger , a place where you could believe a poet might have been stabbed . She had expected something different , not this . It was ugly , it was shabby  --  but not in any interesting sense . It was , sadly , indescribable . She had wanted to be startled by its grime , and the taxi ride across the vast gray sink of London had been long enough to suggest a real journey to a strange distant place . Deptford was only distant : characterless , without any color , a dismal intermediate district , neither city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown terraces  --  many defaced with slanted obscure slogans  --  and very dusty . You could become asthmatic here : the air stank of dust and chemicals and the unhelpful sun was the size of an apricot . She looked for the river ( she could hear boats farting in water ) and saw a green gasworks . Closer , a power station poured out heavy clouds of tumbling smoke that gave the sky an ashy hue . The smoky sky seemed no higher than those square chimneys . If anyone asked she would say Deptford was like the scar tissue of a badly healed wound . She was oppressed by the council estates , cheapp140towers of public housing draped in washing lines . All those people waiting ; she could see many of them balancing on flimsy balconies , staring gravely down at her . She might have gone back to Hill Street  --  her disappointmentwas great enough  --  but it had been so hard for her to get here ! Not only the taxi ( the driver first refused to take her that distance  --  she had had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation , too . She had telephoned the house five times and either no one answered or else a strange male voice demanded to know who she was . " Who are you ? " she 'd asked in return , and hung up . When , finally , Brodie picked up the phone the girl was evasive , and it was only by Lady Arrow blurting out that she was n't in the least interested in getting her pound back  --  indeed , she 'd gladly give her another one if it was needed  --  that Brodie said to come over and told her the address . " Albacore Crescent ! I can just imagine it . " " It 's on the map . Just get off the train at Deptford . " " We 'll have tea somewhere , " Lady Arrow had said , and now she laughed at the thought of it , seeing nothing in ten minutes of walking but two fish-and-chip shops with steamy windows , and a take-away Chinese restaurant . She was angry for noticing they were filthy ; she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , everywhere she looked , she had to face the limits of her tolerance . And she thought : This is what it means . When people say they 're living in Deptford they mean this , the gasworks , the nasty little shops , these poky houses , the smoke . Really , a pitiful confession . Across Deptford Broadway to the hill and then into Ship Street , where she saw the entry to Albacore Crescent . She had not wanted to arrive by taxi , she deliberately avoided taking it to the door : she was ashamed . But it would not have mattered  --  the house was larger than she expected , and all the blinds were drawn . Seeing it , she remembered why she had come . It was more than a glimpse of Brodie at home , how she lived , what she did , who she saw , a piecing-together of the girl 's otherp141life to make a story for herself she hoped she figured in  --  a way of ordering it , like an artist , so that it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more : Brodie . At Hill Street she had resented Murf 's hold over her , the companionable glances , the laughter , the assumption that she was his . She wanted to separate her from Murf , break his hold over her and have the girl to herself . Lady Arrow was not discontented with her life , but she knew it lacked any edge , and it was enclosed too secure . Other people , living close to the ground , spent more congenial days , like the waiters she envied , whispering intimately to each other in restaurants where she was dining . And sometimes she thought that even the girls she visited in prison had more to challenge and amuse them than she did . The plays she brought them gave her a chance to act with them . She would not be shut out from anyone 's life , and she was surprised that Brodie 's seemed so inaccessible : five phone calls and what amounted to a bribe to gain entry ! She rang the bell , heard footsteps on the stairs , and listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bottom of the door being shot . Brodie 's pale eager face appeared at a crack . " You 're barricaded in ! " said Lady Arrow as she stepped through the door , seeing the locks and bolts and heavy chains . " We do n't usually come in this way , " said Brodie . " We 're supposed to use the back door . " " I hope I 'm not infringing the rules  --  but who makes these rules ? I say , is that your ice-cream van ? " Brodie was shrugging at the questions . " Sort of . It belongs to someone , but they 're not here , see . " She was vague . In a thin sleeveless shirt , Brodie 's breasts budded at the pockets , and Lady Arrow saw the tattoo , the bluebird chevron on her white upper arm . Brodie 's trousers were much too large for her ; she held them by the waist to prevent them falling down . " Hey , Murf  --  she 's here ! " Murf put his head through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sun behind his ears lighted them to lookp142like the membranes of kites , one with a gold tail , the swinging earring . He wore a jersey with a chewed collar , a pair of girl 's tight pink slacks , and in his bare feet he clawed at the rug with his toes . He plucked at the slacks that sheathed his legs and pushed at his thighs . Lady Arrow thought of a pet beast , ridiculously costumed . " They 're mine , " said Brodie . " Them slacks . I 've got his on . We decided to wear each other 's clothes today . " " What a splendid idea . " Lady Arrow moved down the hall and she smelled  --  what ?  --  something she could n't name , a hairiness of sour perfume . " Murf said it turns him on . " " Except it do n't , " said Murf . " It was just an experiment , like . " " A pity it 's not working , " said Lady Arrow . " But then how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucking . I 'd hardly know where to look ! " " Yeah , well , " said Murf , averting his eyes , pushing at his ears . " That 's how it goes . Have a seat . " " Is this all yours ? " Lady Arrow entered the parlor and paced . " It 's quite huge . I think it 's a success , I really do . And I imagine there are lots more rooms in the back and upstairs . It reminds me of a dovecote , all these little rooms rising to the roof . Whatever do you do with them all ? " " There 's some other people , " said Brodie . " Yes , the owner of the ice-cream van . " Murf glanced uneasily at Brodie , then said with mild aggression , " We do n't know nothing about that there van . Maybe someone nicked it and left it there . " " I understand , " said Lady Arrow . " You can trust me with your secrets . " " We do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who got up and left the room . " Of course not , " said Lady Arrow . " Why should you ? " " Have a seat , " said Murf again , pulling a stuffed chair away from the wall and awkwardly presenting it.  |p143Lady  Arrow ignored him . She leaned into the hall and said , " Does it extend very far ? It seems to go on forever , more rooms in the back  --  and a garden as well . " " Here , " said Brodie , entering the room . In an attempt at etiquette she had placed an unopened bottle of pale ale on a green saucer with a souvenir opener . " Oh , I forgot the glass . " " Do n't bother , " said Lady Arrow . " I never drink beer . I 'll have some of this . " She tapped some snuff onto the back of her hand , lifted it to her nostrils and tipping her head back inhaled it . She snorted and blinked , then she said , " Are n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , there 's some pretty groovy places around here . We could go down to the power station . Murf 's got a mate who works there . Or we could take a bus to the Cutty Sark . It 's up Greenwich . " " I meant a tour of your house . " " There 's nothing to see , " said Brodie . " Just more rooms . " " But how many ? " " Six or seven . " " Why it is huge ! " " You ca n't go up , " said Murf . " I 'm redecorating the bathroom . " " Do let me have a peep . " " Have a seat , " said Murf , and now he looked as if he might spring up and throw her into the chair . " Oh , all right , " said Lady Arrow . " But I 'd much rather have a tour of this lovely house . By the way , who owns it ? " Murf said , " Some people . " " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see  --  Brodie will vouch for me  --  I do n't pry . I 'm just interested . I was hoping we could be friends . Do n't you want to be my friend , Murf ? " " Sort of , " said Murf and picked self-consciously at Brodie 's pink slacks sitting so uncomfortably on him and clinging to his skinny thighs . " I 'd like that , " she said . But she thought : No , what 's thep144point , what am I doing here ? She had tried to flatter them by taking an interest in the house ; but flattery did n't work  --  there was narcissism even flattery could n't penetrate , and her compliments , so close to satire , only made them suspicious . She had guessed , alighting from the taxi at Deptford , that it would be a failure and now that was confirmed . She had expected too much , and she could see she was unwelcome . It occurred to her that she might take a hundred pounds from her purse and say , " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought : they were children . You could give them anything , and they would n't notice ; but you could n't take a thing from them . They made themselves inaccessible . She had been foolish to think that she could take Brodie away and keep her . The young were not free enough to know affection , and why , she wondered , did they always insist by their lazy silence on being kidnaped ? Then she saw the Chinese carvings , the jade eggs on wooden tripods and the ivory figures on the fireplace . On the far wall was a painted scroll . Until then they seemed like the cheap plastic chinoiserie she 'd seen in other working-class houses . But these were delicate ; they were small beautiful things , finely done . Even across the room they glittered . " Who do these belong to ? " She walked over and lifted the carving of a camel . It was ivory , heavy and cool , resting perfectly in her hand . It had a red saddle and tiny gold tassels . You had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because a craftsman had held it . And now she could see the brushstrokes on the scroll , a column of anxious swallows in a pale landscape . " They belong to some people , " said Murf . " There 's a few over here . " Brodie brought her a carved red-lacquer box , and Lady Arrow was reminded of an idle child on a beach noticing an adult 's interest in shells , offering to sustain that interest  --  tempting the stranger 's desire and yet knowing nothing even of friendship  --  by searching for more and trailing along until they were both alone in a far-off cove . There was such casual cruelty in innocence.  | " It 's quite beautiful , " said Lady Arrow , opening the lid . There was a mirror on the underside , and Brodie 's face reflected in it , framed by the lining of yellow silk . She wanted her , and again she was mocked by her reason for coming . The face slipped from the mirror . " Chinese . " " And this , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its back . She handed it over . Lady Arrow felt the heat of the girl 's hand on the silver . " Very , very nice , " said Lady Arrow . " Do n't you think so , Murf ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " It do n't belong to me . " " This is my favorite , " said Brodie . She held out a tarnished brass ashtray with a crude pagoda and a Thai dancing girl etched on it . " I like that one , " said Murf . " When you give it a polish it comes up nice and shiny . " Lady Arrow studied it . It was a cheap bazaar trinket , ugly and roughly done , the native 's revenge on tourists . You could cut your hand on it . She smiled at Brodie , agreeing , but she looked at the other objects and thought : She does n't know the difference ; as long as she values this ashtray she will never know me . Murf said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be right down . " He left the room walking in a self-conscious way in the tight slacks . " Anything I can get you ? " asked Brodie . " Call me Susannah , " said Lady Arrow . " I 'd love a cup of tea . " " Right . " Brodie ran . Lady Arrow could hear her shifting the kettle in the kitchen . She went to the door and listened : Brodie was still occupied . She climbed the stairs , distributing her weight , testing each step , taking care not to make them creak . She passed a bathroom , then saw the room in which Murf was changing  --  he was stamping out of the slacks  --  and another room , open and simply empty . She went up another flight , to the top of thep146house . It was darker here the doors were shut . She tried one : locked . The second was open but held only a stack of newspapers and an old sofa . Then she was at the front of the house , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  and the Indian cushions : almost a salon . The sour perfume she 'd smelled earlier was strongest here  --  and she noticed the Burmese box on the mantelpiece , the silk robe , the view from the window . It was her first sight of the Thames : the power station , the old church , the Isle of Dogs , and at a great distance , Saint Paul 's . She wanted more . She went to a long cupboard and threw the door open , and gasped . Seconds later she was laughing very loudly . " Hey ! " Murf was on the stairs . She hurried into the hall , but he was fast , moving nimbly on all fours up the last flight . He bounded to the landing and ran to the door of the back room , then crouched in an attitude of truculence , like a startled sentry , protecting the room as Hood had ordered . " I told you not to come up here ! You 're not supposed to  --  this here room 's private . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interrupted her laughter . But now she saw the absurd boy with the reddened ears , puffing and holding himself so importantly in front of the door  --  the wrong door !  --  and she laughed all the harder . " Sneak ! " he said . " I 'll fump you ! "  |p147SHE  WAS DELIGHTED , she was justified , she knew why she had come : it was an inspired visit . And she had a claim on them . She would stake it emphatically . Now she could reach the girl , separate her from Murf ; and though she felt like an intruder and vulnerable to humiliation ( it had happened before : that hysterical procurers at Holloway had screamed from her cell , " Here she is again to look at the monkeys ! " )  --  her voice alone sometimes made her an enemy  --  she knew Brodie was hers . And the others , whoever they were : all hers . The knowledge of strength , her certitude , was comedy . She had cracked a great joke . Downstairs she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw the brass ashtray , the piece of junk they 'd singled out and preferred to the small Chinese treasures , and she knew how they could make such a silly mistake . But what worthless thing were they protecting in that other room ? " Your friend was upstairs , " said Murf . " Nosing around . " " It probably do n't matter , " said Brodie . " It 's private , " said Murf . He spoke to Lady Arrow . " I told you it 's private , did n't I ? " " You 're being awfully boring , Murf , " said Lady Arrow . " What is it you do n't want me to see ? " " Nothing . It 's just private . " Lady Arrow had become calmer , acquired the serene smugnessof ownership , though for moments she fell silent , remembered , and laughed . The situation was under control . She sat down , jamming her hips into the chair , and she had the immovable solidity of a householder in her own parlor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " You better go now . " " But I have n't had my tea , " she said and motioned for Brodie to bring it . She took the cup and smiled at Brodie over the rim . " You did n't tell me you lived in such a fascinating house . " " It 's okay , " said Brodie . Lady Arrow drank her tea , smiling between sips . " When she finishes , " said Murf , " she 's pushing off . I 'm not taking the blame for this . " " Dry up , Murf , it do n't matter . " " Blame ? For what ? " said Lady Arrow . " Sneaking around upstairs . Sticking your nose where it do n't belong . " " Did I see your precious room ? " " You wanted to . " " What a lot of balls you talk , Murf , " said Lady Arrow . " Brodie , is n't there anything you can do with him ? " " Brodie knows the rules , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you , so I 'm telling you straight . " Wules , strite : she almost laughed . She said , " You came to my house , did n't you ? Did I make a fuss ? I 'm simply returning the visit , doing the civilized thing . " Murf had no reply . He glared at Brodie and repeated , " She knows the rules . " " It 's not even five o'clock . You ca n't chase me away so soon . " " Maybe when you finish your tea , " said Brodie . " Mud 's right . We 've got this stupid rule . " " That rule can not possibly apply to me , " said Lady Arrow . She raised her cup and drained it . " Right , " said Murf , " that 's it . You 're finished  --  out you go . " He stood up and advanced on her ; he was more belligerent in his own clothes  --  faded jeans , a black jersey , an old waistcoat  --  than he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even standing he was not much taller than Lady Arrow , who was seated . " I adore bad manners , " said Lady Arrow , smiling at himp149with her long sallow face . " Yours are quite terrible , Murf , but I assure you mine are much worse . " She turned to Brodie . " I think I 'll have more tea . " " No more bloody char , " said Murf . " Brodie , " said Lady Arrow , holding out her empty cup . Murf put his hands on his hips and glowered at her . She said , " Oh , do sit down and stop being such a ham . " " They 're coming back , " said Murf to Brodie . " They 're not going to like this  --  " Lady Arrow looked abstracted for a moment , then burst out laughing . Wonderful ! "  --  and I ai n't sticking up for you this time . It 's your lookout . " " It 's this bloke that lives here , " Brodie said , turning from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank wall . " He wo n't like it if he sees you here . " " I 'd very much like to meet him , " said Lady Arrow . Another competitor  --  who ? And what hold did he have ? But she was unconcerned . Brodie was slim , with a fawn 's small coy face , and short hair  --  so awkward and small-breasted she could have been a boy . It was a type Lady Arrow especially desired , the light uncertain body , the clear skin . She wanted Brodie in a boy 's beautiful suit and velvet tie , and to make love to her before an enormous mirror , undressing her slowly and hearing her clamor for breath as she slipped the clothes from her skin . " He 's got this bad temper , " Brodie explained in a monotone , tucking her white arms against her side and hunching her shoulders . " Like he breaks things . " Murf was close to Lady Arrow . He showed her the pegs of his teeth and said , " He 'll break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very strong neck , my boy , " said Lady Arrow , and she thought : Brike your neck  --  they ca n't hurt me , I own them . She was buoyant . Upstairs she had proven herself unassailable . The boy with dowels for teeth stood near her mouthing threats , but there was nothing more he could do , and she pitied his helplessness . " I would love another cup , Brodie . "  | " There 's no more tea , " said Brodie . " Do n't deny me . " " Take a walk ! " cried Murf , working his shoulders menacingly . " Dear girl , " said Lady Arrow , " I do believe he 's frightened you . But you have nothing to fear  --  you 'll see . " Brodie was being obstinate , and Lady Arrow saw she would have to fight to have her  --  she would win , but she did n't want to destroy Murf . She hated the way Murf nagged  --  he looked so silly trying to threaten her with that face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waistcoat . She believed she could have knocked him over quite easily , but she only laughed . There were bangings at the back entrance , the slam of a door , the thud and pause of boots . " It 's him ! " said Murf , and now he looked desperate . " Get out , get out ! " " Take your filthy hands off me , " said Lady Arrow . To free herself from Murf 's pushing she simply stood up . Then she was out of reach , and again she felt sorry for him . His anger was so futile . Perhaps it was futility , nothing more , that made him angry . Brodie said , " Please go . " " I do n't think I shall , " said Lady Arrow , but she had barely finished the sentence when she saw the parlor door open and the hawk-faced man enter . He was tall , with stiff black hair and he almost frightened Lady Arrow with his squinting eyes . He wore a black raincoat and black boots , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through his posture and his fixed expression of sullen inquiry he communicated threat like a crow . She saw him as her equal , and in Brodie and Murf 's cringing she saw his hold over them . But she would not be sent away . This was her competitor for Brodie . She was glad he looked strong , and yet to win was no victory  --  the advantage was hers . He shut the door and stared at her . " I told her to get out , " said Murf , his voice becoming ap151quack . " She would n't go . Brodie let her in . But do n't worry  --  she do n't know anything  --  " " Shut up , " said Hood , without turning to look at Mures little gestures , his accusatory leaps at Lady Arrow . Hood bore down on her with his narrowed eyes . " This here 's Lady Arrow , " said Brodie . " She 's a friend of mine . " " A very old friend , " said Lady Arrow . " You said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this to register . Then Lady Arrow straightened : she would make him regret saying that . He said , " Anything I can do for you ? " " Yes , you can tell Murf to stop accusing me of spying . He wo n't listen to me . " " He 's just doing his duty , " said Hood . " We do n't want strangers here . " " I 'm hardly a stranger to Brodie , " said Lady Arrow , slurring her words to load them with sexual intimacy . " But if you insist , I 'll go . " " I insist . " " It was n't Brodie 's fault at all . I invited myself . I did n't realize you had such strict rules . But I quite understand . Under the circumstances , it would be rather awkward if you had people dropping in . " " Under the circumstances , I think you 'd better get your ass out of here , " said Hood evenly . Lady Arrow smiled . " They warned me you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing just behind Hood , seeming to shelter from the gaze of the tall woman . " Do n't get excited , squire , " said Hood . " She 's going . " " What a pair of monkeys you look , " said Lady Arrow . " But I know you 're perfectly harmless . You would n't touchme . " " Would n't I ? " Murf stepped forward and crouched as if preparing to pounce on her.  | " Easy , squire . " Then he spoke to Lady Arrow . " What are you waiting for ? " " I 'd like a word with you before I go . I 'm sorry , I do n't think we 've been introduced . " He told her his name , then he said , " I do n't have anything to say to you . " " Perhaps not , but that 's beside the point . I have something to say to you . Do you think we could be alone ? " " No , " said Muff . " Tell her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Arrow impatiently . " Brodie , be an angel  --  do take him away . " Brodie said , " Come on , Murf . Let 's go . " Murf appealed to Hood : " Do n't listen to her . I caught her snooping , but she did n't see nothing . She 's Brodie 's mate  --  I did n't want her here , but Brodie said  --  " " Upstairs , squire , " Hood said softly . He had not moved . He had entered the room and folded his arms ; his posture was unchanged , nor had his eyes shifted from the tall woman 's face . Murf muttered a complaint , and he kicked at the floor , but he did not reply directly to Hood . He screwed up his face at Lady Arrow , then turned and swaggered out of the room , still muttering . Brodie shrugged and without a word followed him . Her abruptness hurt Lady Arrow , who until that moment had expected the girl to return with her to Hill Street . She wanted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . But she said , " How very Victorian you are  --  what a stern parent . You remind me of my father . You walk in and they flutter like doves . I suppose they accept it because they know so little , but when they know that you have no right to order them about they 'll hate you . I 'm sure you do n't understand Brodie at all . " " If that 's all you have to say , you can go . " " Mister Hood , I believe in freedom . " " That 's fine with me , Mrs. Arrow . " " Never call me that  --  Susannah , if you like , " she said , and went on in a different tone . " Freedom must be taken , snatchedp153if necessary , whatever the cost . Do you think a woman like me has no interest in such things ? " " A woman like you is probably interested in a lot of things , " said Hood . " But take my advice  --  do n't get interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find all of you fascinating , " said Lady Arrow . " Do you mind if I sit down ? " " Do n't bother . You 're not going to be here very long . " " Now you 're being stern with me , and I 'm twice your age . Do I know your father ? " She smiled . " Really , you should n't take that tone . I 'd like you to visit me some time . I think you 'd enjoy meeting my friends , exchanging ideas with them . They have more in common with you than you might think . " " No thanks . " " I think you 'll change your mind , " she said with playful malice . " Look , sister , " he said , " I do n't think you 're my type . If you 're through you can hit the road . " " Oh , God , " said Lady Arrow in admiration , " I wish I could say that like you . " Hood moved , and Lady Arrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms . He took off his raincoat and threw it over the back of a chair . Lady Arrow strolled to the small fireplace and said , " Yes , I think you will change your mind and visit me . " She selected one of the carvings , an insect worked in ivory , and weighed it in her hand . She said , " I 've been admiring your art collection . It 's really rather beautiful . " " Presents from people I happen to like . Put that down before you break it . " " They 're hard to get in England  --  very scarce nowadays . I imagine you were in Asia  --  they 're the sort of pieces one finds there , are n't they ? " " If you say so . " Hood took the carving from her hand and put it back on the mantelpiece . " Brodie and Murf have n't the vaguest idea . Oh , I 'm surep154they find them pretty , but they do n't know their true value . Brodie is so sweet . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That scroll . It 's silk . Ch'ing Dynasty , is it not ? It 's late , but it 's lovely . No , they do n't know how valuable things can be . Children are unmoved by sham and humbug . But they are unmoved by sincerity and beauty , too . Such simple creatures  --  not blind , but so shortsighted . " Hood was going to speak , to prevent her from saying anything more he agreed with . She had come close to echoing his own feeling in calling them children and defining their simple slowness . But Lady Arrow interrupted him . She said , " May I say you are a most fortunate man , Mister Hood ? " " Your time 's up , " he said . " But I 'm not finished ! " " Now , " said Hood , raising his voice to insist . " Yes , I 've been admiring your art collection . In these rooms  --  " " Listen , " said Hood. "  --  and upstairs , " Lady Arrow went on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the event he did n't seem to know I 'd seen it . " " You 've got a nerve . " " Not me , Mister Hood , " said Lady Arrow . " It 's you who have the nerve . But I admire you for it . You see , I own that painting . Yes ! " She laughed in long mocking shouts , trumpetingin his face . " It 's mine ! It belongs to me ! " Hood relaxed ; he stepped away and smiled . " Which painting are you talking about ? " " You know ! The one in your cupboard . " " I painted that myself . It 's called Death Eating a Cracker . ' " " It was my father 's . You can call it anything you like . " " The Widow , " The Jailer , " The Saint , ' " he said . " It 's just acopy . " " The Rogier self-portrait , " she said . " And you need n't try to deceive me . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're lying , sweetheart . " " No , I 'm not . I was ashamed to admit it  --  it was so valuable . How can you own a thing like that ? It was on loan  --  that got me a tax deduction , for charity , believe it or not . It was so embarrassing I loaned it anonymously . I 've had so many calls from the curator  --  he wanted me to make a statement . Were n't you surprised by the silence ? The lack of response ? And do you know , I was glad it was stolen ! Relieved  --  I ca n't tell you how relieved I was . Now this ! It exceeds my wildest dream . It is magnificent ! " " What are you going to do about it ? " " Absolutely nothing . One ca n't be burgled by people one admires . You can trust me , Mister Hood , I wo n't tell a soul . I might even collect on the insurance  --  my accountant 's been insisting on it . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a bit much for you to want to chase me away . You see , when I saw that picture in your cupboard I suddenly realized what a family affair this has all become . I wish I had planned it this way  --  arranged for someone to steal my own painting . But that sort of thing takes genius . However . " Hood said , " I 'm going to check on everything you say . " " Do that , Mister Hood . You 'll see I 'm telling the truth . " " Okay , now beat it . " " Not so fast , my man , " she said . " You ca n't order me now . You see , your project very much concerns me . I support you ! I believe we can be friends at last , and I consider this house as much mine as yours . Frankly , I was rather hoping Brodie would come back with me . She 's not yours , you know . " " She 's staying here . " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And you 'll visit me now , wo n't you ? " Hood pursed his lips , but said nothing . " I 'm sure of it , " said Lady Arrow , and she picked up her handbag . At the door she said , " I ca n't tell you how pleased I am that things have turned out this way . "  | " Keep going , " said Hood in a flat threatening voice . He banged the door and locked it , but when he went back to the parlor he clapped his hands and laughed  --  a yell of gladness , and still chuckling he sat down and waited for Mayo . The picture stirred him from its hiding place at the top of the house.  |p157AT  MIDNIGHT THERE WAS still no sign of Mayo . He wondered if she could be teasing him with her more frequent absences ; she knew he was waiting and was deliberately hiding herself . She made her inaction secret to give it drama . She was whining in Kilburn over a pint of beer or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had deceived him over the passport , tricked him into forging one for the well-known actress , whose single attribute , so far as he could guess , was her theatrical ability to alter her face . You had access to a wig , so you were a conspirator . Araba had struck him as hysterical and insincere , a fraud , persuasive only to those who did n't know the real thing . The trick had made him doubt his own judgment  --  the victim losing respect for himself when he knows how easily he has been victimized . But he had said nothing to Mayo : he would have his own secrets . He had drawn the cushions to the center of the upstairs room and he lay on them in his bathrobe , with the cupboard door open wide and the lamp tilted to face the painting . He pondered it and smoked a pipe of navy-cut sprinkled with hashish grains . He had a feeling of wealth , the comfortable security of resting in undisturbed solitude . For the moment he wanted no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : now it could not be snatched away ; he did n't need to hide it ; the owner did n't care . It shone on him . Its greatness lay in the way the cubes of color gathered to match his own mood . It was consoling : it did not reproach him  --  perhaps the greatest art never did  --  it exalted the eye . It shimmered with certainty , it was the surest vision , an astonishing light . What Mayo and the others did to enrage him the painting corrected :  |p158it  was the only solace he had received , this illumination . And like a light it printed a small white star on his retina that stayed to remind and console him long after he turned away . There was a knock at the door . Mayo never knocked . It was Murf . " You busy ? " Hood pulled the pipe out of his mouth and blew a gray white cone of smoke at the lamp , watching it untangle in the light . " Come in , squire . Where 's Brodie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said she 's sorry . " Murf bobbed nervously and pushed at his ears . " I do n't know what that old girl told you , but she 's lying . She did n't see nothing . " " It 's okay . But you can tell Brodie she 's got some pretty hot-shit friends . " Hood puffed the pipe . He felt high , happy , a buzz inching down his ears like a centipede with sparking feet . " Do n't let me catch you bringing any lords and ladies down here , squire , or I 'll have to change my socks . " " I hated her , " said Murf , who had started to sweat . " I wanted to brick her . " " No kidding . What for ? " " She was laughing at me . " He pushed at his ears again , a combing motion with his palms . Hood had noticed how he did this when he was upset , made self-conscious by a stranger . But the ears , as if exercised with brushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing like a fucking drain . I could have smashed her face . " " I know the feeling , " said Hood . " Do n't let it get you down . " " Hood ? " Murf sighed , whacked at his ears , and shook his head . " There was something else . I said she did n't see nothing . Well , maybe she did . But it was n't my fault . She come up here while I was changing . I caught her on the stairs . Laughing , she was . I do n't know for sure , but maybe she come in here . " " Maybe , " said Hood . " You could n't help it . " " Honest , I could n't . Brodie was supposed to be watchingp159her . Maybe she seen your picture . Anyway , she did n't nick it , did she ? " " It 's still here , " said Hood . Murf leaned and looked at it , cocking his head to the side as if to understand it better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " It 's a bloke , ai n't it ? Old-fashioned bloke  --  them boots , them clothes . Yeah , I like it . First time I seen it I thought it was poxy . Who 's this flaming great tit , I says . Then Arfa sees it and he says it 's a antique , it 's worth something , they 're paying for them up the West End . He 's got ready money , he says . I thought maybe I could do you some kind of favor , flog it to Arfa . Sorry about that . Anyway , I had a crafty look at it . Later , this was . I 'm staggered ! It 's all shiny , sort of moving and blowing up in me mush . Bloke 's looking at me , yeah , like he 's going to jump out and kick me in the goolies . " Hood loved him for that . He had despaired of ever changing Murf . The boy was unaffected by the afternoon concerts on the radio Hood had listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symphony , not the finest phrase had altered those blaring ears , and nothing Hood had ever shown him  --  the Chinese scroll , the carvings from Hue  --  had worked his eyes wider than a squint . He had given Murf a Chinese treasure and Murf , making a claw of his fingers , had handled it like a turd . The silk shirt from Vientiane , his present to Murf for helping shift the arsenal and the loot , had become a rag on his skinny shoulders ; the pocket bulged and drooped where he kept his stash of tobacco . He carried himself like an ape , with his arms hanging loose . He had one skill : the clock-legged bomb . But a sense of loyalty had brought him to the room tonight ; he had told the truth ; his response to Lady Arrow was crudely accurate  --  Hood himself had wanted to smash her in the face . And his description of the painting  --  how civilizing a thing it was !  --  had insight . In that small crooked boy Hood saw a shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said , " I 've been trying to figure out who it is. "  | " Funny bloke . " Murf scratched his head . " Sort of smiling and sad at the same time . " " And look at his eyes . " " You think he 's going to say something , " said Murf . " Yeah , I like it . " He caught his lips with his fingers in embarrassment and pinched them . He said , " Reminds me of you , he does . " " No . " But Hood peered at the painting . " Maybe not , " said Murf . " He 's posh like you , but not only that . Yeah , I think he does . Straight . " Hood said suddenly , " What do you want , Murf ? " " Nothing . " Nuffink . " I want to give you something , squire . Anything . " " I do n't know , " said Murf carefully . " But there 's one thing . " " Name it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught his lips again with his fingers . " Just do n't laugh at me . " Hood waited for more . Was this a warning , a condition to prepare him for the wish  --  or the wish itself ? Murf fidgeted and said no more , and Hood saw that it was all he wanted , to be free of ridicule . The woman 's laughter had wounded him and made her his enemy . Hood said , " Okay . " " Me mates do n't laugh at me . " " Then we 'll be mates . " Murf grinned , filling his cheeks , as if he had food in his mouth ; and he put out his hand , offering it as an equal . He said , " Shake . " Hood reached up and wrung his hand  --  Muff 's palm was damp with nervousness  --  and he said , " Now I 'm going to hit the sack . " Murf hesitated . " Mayo did n't show . " " No , " said Hood . " Maybe it 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something big : now it was a private joke they could both share . " Are you going to tell her about the old girl ? " " Do you want me to ? " " She 'll laugh at me. "  | " I can say I was here the whole time . " " Right . " Murf brought up another gobbling grin . " And she 's bending your ear , this old girl . Then you 're out of the room , you 're having a wash . You do n't know nothing . Then she goes sneaking upstairs . You hear this fucking laugh of hers . " " And I caught the bitch in this room . " " Beautyful . " " That 's what I 'll tell her then . " Murf said , " Good night , mate . " Mayo did not arrive until the next morning , and showing her face at that early hour , with an over-brisk apology but no explanation for her lateness , and yet with a guilty pallor made of smugness and fatigue  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of a woman returning to her husband and children after spending the night with her lover . Romance : if not actual , then a metaphor , since she had always treated her political involvement like an affair , her energy hinting at brief infatuation . Brodie stirred her bowl of cornflakes with a spoon and said , " There 's no more milk . " " I 've had my breakfast , " said Mayo . " I was up hours ago . I 'll just have a coffee . Any post ? " " A letter from the National Gallery , " said Hood . " They want their picture back . " " That 's not funny . " Murf looked at Hood and laughed . " Look , sugar , " said Hood , touching Brodie on the arm , " why do n't you and Murf do the dishes . I 've got a bone to pick with the klepto . " " I always have to do the dishes , " said Brodie , complaining . Murf rose and began gathering empty cups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , squire . "  |p162In  the parlor , Mayo said , " I 'm exhausted . " Hood did n't react . " The meeting went on for hours . " " The offensive , " said Hood lightly , as if repeating a familiar joke . " That was part of it , " she said . " And we expelled someone . " " Do I know him ? " " Her , " said Mayo . " I doubt it . " " We had a visitor yesterday . " " Not the police . " Mayo held her breath . " No . A friend of Brodie 's . " " I did n't think she had any friends . " " You 'd be surprised , " said Hood . " It was a lady  --  in the technical sense . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " " I 'll tell you in a minute . But first I want you to tell me something . Where exactly did you get your picture ? " " The self-portrait ? Highgate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No one lives there , you fool . It 's a museum . " " That 's the first I 've heard of it . I thought you got it from a private house . I imagined you sneaking through the window , tiptoeing down the corridors  --  the folks snoring in their beds . I thought it was pretty cool . She 's a gutsy chick , I thought . But , for Christ 's sake , it was a museum . So it was n't such a big deal after all , was it ? " " There was a burglar alarm , " she said . " There were risks . What are you trying to say ? " " Just this . You gave me the impression you knocked off a private house  --  and all you really did was waltz into a museum and rip off a picture . If it had been a private house you might have gotten somewhere , and if you 'd chosen the right one you 'd have scored in spades  --  you 'd have had them screaming their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went for a museum and came out with one picture  --  you could have taken a dozen ! " " What 's wrong with a museum ? " " Museums do n't have that kind of money . They do n't payp163ransoms , no one lives in them , they 're empty . " He sighed and said , " How 'd you happen to settle on Highgate House ? " " I told you all this at Ward 's  --  that first day . " " You were drunk . You did n't have a plan . All you talked about was a picture . " " Yes , and I knew where it was . " " You checked it out ? " " No , " she said , " my parents used to take me there . " She stated it as a simple fact ; but it was a revelation . It was the most she had ever told him about herself , and it was nearly all he needed to know . My parents used to take me there . He knew her parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their daughter to the museum , the mother apart , the doting father holding the girl 's hand . They had planned it carefully ; they knew they were paying a high compliment to the little girl 's intelligence in the family outing  --  part of her education , while the rest of her school friends idled at the zoo . A restful , uplifting interlude , strolling among the masterpieces . Privilege . And he saw the daughter , a spoiled child , small for her age , but bright , alert , in kneesocks and necktie , noticing details her parents missed  --  that Bosch cripple in his leather vest , the thread of piss issuing from the bowlegged man in the Brueghel , the Turner thundercloudand tide wrack of sea-monsters ' jaws , the tiger launching itself from the margin of the Indian engraving . Look , dear , an angel . And finally the attentive parents brought her to the Flemish self-portrait and urged her to admire the tall man in black : What do you see through that window ? Later , they bought postcards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how that afternoon they had inspired the girl  --  made her see the value of art even if she could not see its beauty ; how their encouragement that particular day , the origin of all her careless romance , had made that little girl into a thief . Hood knew her parents , he saw them , because he could see his own . The same encouragement in a different museum , a different light : a Minoan snake goddess had marked his eye.  |p164They  had been taught to respect art , so thievery mattered ; and their parents ' legacy was this taste , a hesitation . Only Brodie and Murf acted without hesitation . They could destroy easily because they had never seen what creation was  --  they did not know enough to be guilty ; but Mayo , and he , knew too much to be innocent . Mayo saw the strain of memory on his face . She said , " What 's wrong ? " " You blew it . You 're a flop . " He told her the version he had promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood immediately , quicker than Hood himself had . She closed her eyes and he could see she was relieved  --  as he had been , but perhaps for a different reason : he had never wanted to lose the picture and she had worried about jail . He said , " Maybe you 'll listen to me now . " " Do you think she 'll grass ? " " Not a chance , " said Hood . " She 's on your side  --  whatever side that is . " Mayo said , " You 'll find out soon enough . " " Really ? " " Do n't you see ? That 's one of the reasons I was held up last night . We expelled someone  --  " " So there 's a post vacant , " he said . " You can put it that way . I was trying to convince them you were clean . Well , they 're convinced . " Mayo lowered her voice . " There 's a problem , Val . They want to talk to you . They think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that . " " Oh , God , do n't tell me you 're getting cold feet ! " " Cold feet , " said Hood , sneering . " Wise up , sister . " " I knew it . As soon as things started to go your way you'dbegin your consul act  --  the big , cool , noncommital thing . " " I 'll play it by ear . " " They 're coming tonight . " " I might be out tonight . "  | " I told them they could count on you . " " They can count on me tomorrow . I 've got other plans . " He stood up and moved towards the door . " Where are you going ? " " That should n't be hard for you to figure out . You 've got training  --  you said so ! You 're a conspirator , are n't you ? You do n't have to ask questions like that . Get your raincoat and shadow me . " " Do n't go now , Val . Stay awhile  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me wait , please . " " You made me wait last night , sweetheart . " He looked at her imploring face . He would n't stay . There was Lorna , but more , he was punishing Mayo for her past , for betraying her parents ' trust ; the picture . My parents used to take me there . " So that 's it . You 're going to get your own back on me . God , it 's as stupid as a marriage ! It 's sickening . You 've got other plans . All these secrets . You 're hiding something from me . Why do n't you just come out and say it  --  you 're not interested in me anymore . " " But I am . Come on , smile . " " The painting , " she said . " They trusted me after that . If they find out it belongs to that woman they wo n't like it  --  it 's no good to them . " " I wo n't tell them . " " Thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a failure . " " Bullshit , " said Hood . " Think of the painting ! It 's yours  --  you 've committed the perfect crime ! " " Kiss me , " she said . He hesitated , then he drew near to her . She said , " What do you want ? " " I want to kiss you , sister . " " Do n't , " she said . She faced the wall and said , " Go ! That 's what you really want to do , is n't it ? " " No , " he said . " I want to kiss you . " She turned expectantly and lifted her arms to embrace him , but Hood was on his way out of the room.  |p166As  he passed through the kitchen , he slapped Murf on the shoulder . Murf said , " Take me with you , " and whispered , " I do n't want to stay here with these two hairies . " " Next time , pal . " It was a lovely autumn day and Hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first see the sweeper  --  just the father today , with his shovel and broom and the yellow barrel on wheels . The man pushed at the papers and dead leaves , then stooped to pick up a button . He looked at Hood with mistrust and said , " That your ice-cream van ? " " Not mine , " said Hood . " I ca n't sweep there unless it 's moved . " " I do n't know anything about it , " said Hood , and he heard the man mutter a curse.  |  --  BECAUSE WHEN IT CAME , he was thinking , the thunderclap and short circuit in the heavens , announcing itself there in the city like the rumble and flash of summer lightning , it would travel in every direction and be most evident here on the pitches of this bald heath : a sudden airless fissure streaking across the grass to that silent church , dividing Blackheath into two treeless slopes . Already there were no trees , so the slightest crack would heave open the unrooted ground and make a canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's most mammoth sewer ran under this heath . The morning , so beautiful , with tufts of white cloud racing in the sky , intimated a ripeness that was next to decay  --  the season 's warning . And more than this , Blackheath , a square mile of grass , was like a roomy cemetery , all that space awaiting diggers and coffins . How lonely sat the city that was full of people ! She was a widow , she who had had an imperial fortune . The princess of cities was supine with tramplings . The prospect made him sad , remembering . He had protected himself from life , which was pain , but the last pain was unavoidable . Yet if the eruption came , the fissure underfoot , the storm overhead , he might be granted the life he had denied himself , as the war had briefly proven his resourcefulness ; and he came to see in the quake he imagined a humbly heroic retirement , testing him with the repeated whisper " Die ! " He would say no and live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bus . His mind , undistracted by a crossword puzzle , sped easily to thoughts of doom ; he looked up from the simple puzzle and there was the unsolvable world . He lingered over his an/noyance . She had rung again , as she had done a month ago , with the same weepy haste . I must see you , she 'd said , it 's ven ' important . You 're the only one who can help me . A dirty trick , that ; singling him out to throw herself on him . Perhaps you can stop by on your way to work . I live quite near you now  --  Blackheath . But only the map made it near . In every other way it was a troublesome detour . He would not get to Rackstraw 's before lunchtime . Charity blunted his anger , and he made his objection general : I 'm glad we never had a daughter . He recognized her house at once , Mortimer Lodge , the fresh coat of pale green paint and white trim subduing the Georgian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the heath , like a fort fronting an open plain , defying intruders . It was secure , unshakable , detached , not crowded by nearby houses ; and though it was not tall , its weight was apparent in the spread of its bay-windowed wings . Its hedge had body , its garden balance . The girl was luckier than she knew , but as Mr. Gawber swung open the gate he had a vision  --  he did not know why : perhaps it was an effect of the sunlight slanting explosively on the roof tiles  --  a vision of Mortimer Lodge bursting open ; the front toppling forward into the fountain and bird bath and the roof caving in and a puff of smoke rising from its shattered design . He endured it , let it pass across his mind , and he was left breathless . Now the house was unmarked . He thought he had rid himself of these punishing visions , but since the day he had uttered " macaroon " to the strangers on the crossed line he had sensed a fracture in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , enlivened , like an old man who senses the onset of magic in him . He wondered if he was mad , then dismissed the thought . He was only late for work , and Araba 's phone call the previous night had made his dreams anxious and disconnected ( searches , a son , ruins ) . He thought : I hope she does n't cry . He pushed the bell and set a dog yapping inside . The gnome-faced woman with freckles answered the door , the puppy under her arm yelping and choking like a child in tears.  |p169He  had been told this woman 's name ; he could not remember it . Tomorrow , seismic , was at the front of his mind . He removed his bowler hat and said , " I believe we 've met . " " Araba 's waiting for you , " said the little woman . " I 'm in here , " called Araba , and when Mr. Gawber found her in her loose blue dressing gown in the sunny room , he was ashamed for having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself with exaggeration  --  surely that was insanity , not magic ? Araba said , " I 'm sorry you had to come here like this , but honestly there 's no one else who can help me . " It 's no trouble , " said Mr. Gawber . " It gives me a chance to see your lovely house . " " You do n't think it 's corny ? I always wanted to live in the country  --  I had to get out of Chelsea . It was so stifling . We 're going to grow our own vegetables here . " Mr. Gawber joined her at the window as she indicated the half-dug garden , a vertical spade in a small rectangle of hacked earth , like the beginnings of a cemetery plot , her own grave . He saw frailty on the actress 's face , lines of indecision he had never noticed before , deepened by shadow . It was more than the shaken guarded look that women habitually had , vulnerable in dressing gowns in their own homes ; it was a threatened wincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered , heard a very loud noise . And dramatizing this with tragic pats on his arm she passed the unease to him , made him apprehensive , so that staring through the window to what looked to be a family graveyard he could only say , " No , I could n't agree more . " She peered abstractedly over the hedge as if into the past , and the abstraction in her eyes entered her voice as a drawl when she said , " Wat Tyler marched over there , on that road . He was a fantastic person . He was into revolt before people knew the word . God , why are n't there people like that anymore ? " " Good question . " Wat Tyler , the lunatic with the pitchfork , leading his mob of gaffers ? " I wish I knew the answer . "  |p170Suddenly  Araba said , " You know , I 've never been honest with you . " He did n't know how to reply . He said , " I never knew Wat Tyler had been here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in a new light . " " But you 've always been honest with me , " she said , ignoring Mr. Gawber , who was nodding studiously at the heath . " You 've always told me the truth . " " I suppose I have , " he said . " But there it is . " " I was really touched that you came to the play . It meant something . " " A very great pleasure , " he said , and pretending to look at his shoes he glanced at his watch . Nearly ten . What did the woman want ? " When I saw you there I knew you believed in me . You 'll stand by me and help me no matter what . " He said , " It 's the least I can do . " " I admire your frankness  --  it 's something I never learned . " My frankness ? What have I ever exposed ? But her statementgave him courage and he said , " I think I should tell you the tax people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefcase . " I have the correspondence somewhere here . " " Do n't show me ! " She walked to the far end of the room , fleeing the letters he held . " I could n't bear that . No , put them away . " He stuffed them into the briefcase . " They think we 're dragging our feet . " " What have you told them ? " " The standard thing . Thank you for yours of the et cetera . We are awaiting instructions from our client et cetera . Yours faithfully . " He frowned . " They think we 're being a bit bolshie . " " Perhaps we are . " " I could n't agree more . " " But that 's not what I wanted to discuss , " she said . " Of course not . "  | " Mister Gawber , that fellow you brought to the play  --  " " Mister Hood , " he said . " Very interesting chap . " " Is he a friend of yours ? " " I suppose he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Really , " she said , and her tone softened . " I was hoping you could tell me something about him . " " There 's not an awful lot I can tell you , " he said . " I met him purely by accident some time ago . He 's become a client . " He thought of Hood . A friendly sort . He had enjoyed his company , but Miss Nightwing was causing him distress . He wondered if at a certain age one turned to other men for consolation . Women did n't turn to other women ; they never lost their appetite for men  --  they still hungered at sixty . But he had only been at ease with men , and he was glad to be acting for Hood  --  that weekly check . Odd request ; but it was an odd business . " American , is n't he ? " " What 's that ? Oh , yes . But one of your better sort . " " The thing is , " said Araba , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . Mr. Gawber saw her nakedness and the shock blinded him . He went shy . She said , " The thing is , I was counting on you to tell me where he lives . McGravy and I are giving a little party and we wanted to invite him . I said to McGravy , I know . I 'll ask Mister Gawber . He 'll be glad to tell me . ' " Mr. Gawber laughed and said , " I 'd love to help you out . " " Good , " said Araba . " But I 'm afraid I ca n't , " he went on . " Business . Silly rule , really . I do n't divulge clients ' addresses . I 've been asked enough times for yours , my dear . I always say , My lips are sealed ' and hope the person wo n't press me too hard . " She said , " But you 've always been so frank with me . " " Exactly , " he said . " I am being frank with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " All I want to know is his address . So I can contact him for this party . Surely you understand ? "  |p172He  could n't look . The question was pardonable ; but the nakedness ? The dressing gown flapped . Did she know she was naked ? The whiteness at the edge of his eye chilled him like snow , and he felt fear , like frost , in his own joints . He had been frozen in just that way , faced by a strange drooling dog on a footpath . " I understand perfectly , " he said almost sorrowfully to the window , which held in its glaze segments of her body . Why was she putting him through this ? " But I ca n't help you . I must be going . I 'm late for work as it is . " " Mister Gawber , I wo n't let you go unless you tell me . " She closed in on him carelessly . He folded his arms to block the view , but saw on her face an unreasonable wrath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unhinged her . She took it personally . If she touches me I 'll scream . He wanted to be out of the house , and he thought : I will never come here again for any purpose whatsoever . He said , " You 're going to catch your death like that . " " I do n't care . " She pushed at her dressing gown , but the white fabric was her own flesh . " It 's nippy . " His eyes hurt . " Tell me  --  I must know ! " " This is very awkward , " he said . Araba raised one leg and put her foot on the seat of a chair . Her thigh shook . She said , " Do n't you have any feelings ? " " A compromise , then . " He straightened himself . He had seen under her flat belly a clinging mouse . " I 'll meet you halfway . Give me a note and I 'll see that he gets it . That 's simple enough . " Araba said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you protecting him ? Has he something to hide ? " " I respect privacy  --  yours , anyone 's . " " I have nothing to hide ! " said Araba and opened her dressing gown , showing her body : a narrow column of ice , the coldest candle he had ever seen . Once , she had told him she was a bitch . He had denied it , but now he saw the accuracy ofp173it . How was it possible for the actress to play a bitch and not have that malice in her ? The bitch , the whore , the nag , the shrew : they lived in the actress , she gave them voice . She could not be forgiven her roles . " Try to understand , " he pleaded , memorizing the carpet 's blooms . " All right , have it your way , " she said , and wrapped herself again in blue . " I 'll send you a letter . But if he does n't reply I 'm bound to be a bit suspicious . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 'm sure he 'll be in touch with you . He seems a most dependable sort of chap . " Araba said , " I never realized until now you hated me so much . " He tried to reassure her , but he saw how he was failing at it and he left . Outside , his confusion hardened into anger : he raged , he swore , and again in the grassy cemetery of the heath he saw the shadow of a seam preparing to part for the canyon of a mass grave , to swallow it all . The calamity  --  but no , it was only a cloud passing overhead . Not yet , not yet.  | " You LIKE THEM ? " She was wearing white thigh-length boots ; the short black skirt was new as well , and standing before him she reminded him of a tropical bird with slender legs , a small-bodied heron raising her head and flicking her tail before taking flight . She walked up and down for him  --  the boots made her taller : not the slouching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novelty of her height , she stood straighter and danced towards him , laughing . Then she sat down beside him and smoothed the boots . " I 've always wanted ones like these . Real leather . " " Classy , " said Hood . He knew they were out of fashion elsewhere , but they were still considered chic in Deptford . " You do n't think they make me look like a tart ? " She narrowed her eyes and peered sideways at him . " A little bit , " he said . " Maybe that 's why I like them . " " I 'll go up the Broadway looking for pickups . " " You could make a fortune as a hooker , " he said . " I 'd take a cut . " " Funny , " she said . " First time I seen you I took you for a ponce . Ron knew a lot of them . They 'd come sniffing around for him . Something about the eyes . You 've got mean eyes . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You think so ? " She wriggled on the sofa . She laughed . " Me , I 'm a raver  --  you do n't know ! " " A new skirt , too , " he said . " Nice . " " Got a blouse upstairs . I 'm saving that for later . You can almost see through it . " " The hooker , " he said . She wrinkled her nose . " It do n't matter . "  |p175The  new clothes flattered her , and he knew they were for him . Lately , Lorna had begun to dress up for his afternoon visits . Suspicious at first , she had worn old dresses and slippers in the house as if to challenge his interest . She said , " Do n't mind me  --  I usually pig it around the house . " But he noticed that she always made up her face and wore a white raincoat and silk scarf when she took Jason to the playgroup  --  for the other mothers . With time she relaxed ; she sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with trusting familiarity , as if they had spent the night together . Hood had not responded to her clothes ; he imagined her in other clothes , a riding outfit , a leather suit , a great robe ; he played with the idea that there was no difference between her and a princess but jewels . But now she dressed for him as she did for the mothers at Jason 's playgroup , and today the clothes were new . The money had arrived . He visited her regularly . He asked nothing of her . If there was time they smoked the pipe . She saw nothing unusual in his visits . At one time she might have been able to ask , " What do you want ? " and demand he be explicit . But ( and like the crescent of scar over her eye he had always meant to ask about  --  Weech 's work ? ) it was too late for that . He liked her too much to risk embarrassing her . He believed they were as close as friends could be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each other 's weaknesses . Once she had said , " I thought you wanted to fuck me , " and when he laughed she added , " It 's better this way  --  for now . " He had wanted to , but he was shamed by his advantage  --  his victim 's wife was also his victim  --  then he decided that sex made a couple unequal with doubting tension : if sex was tried it became the only reassurance , and there was power for the one who withheld it . That part had been set aside , though for Hood it was accidental  --  he had only desired her the first instant he 'd seen her rushing out of the house . He had n't known who she was and then , seconds later when he remembered , the feeling died in him ; afterward , he did not think of making love to her . Hisp176remoteness made her curious and inspired trust in her , and though he saw how she was uncertain of him in the early weeks when she had expected sexual sparring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was plain he had no further intentions and she stopped being defensive . She was perfectly naked , but he did not want another victim . The afternoons they spent together were happy . They touched more than lovers because they were not lovers ; they kissed easily , they hugged and she lay with her head in his lap . It meant friendship . No further bargain was being struck : the kisses led to nothing . With the sexual element removed they were equal , mutually protective , like brother and sister , as if they had shared a parent they both hated , now dead and unmourned . And it was partly true : Weech was in a cemetery in the blackest part of Ladywell . Hood saw her new boots and skirt as an expression of her freedom , and he admired them as a brother might , congratulating his sister 's taste . She said , " Ron never let me buy new clothes  --  at least not like these ones . Men are such fuckers . They like to see dolly-girls , all tarted up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wives . " " You think every man is like Ron . " " I did n't know any others , did I ? " " You know me . " " I used to think you were the same , " she said . " Only you ai n't . " " I sure ai n't . " " You 're the quiet type , you are . You bottle it up . I used to think , What 's he waiting for ? ' " " You do n't think that anymore ? " " Now I know what you 're waiting for  --  nothing . " She pursed her lips and kissed him , holding his head , then she stamped her boots and said , " These things are killing my feet . Here , help me get the buggers off . " She zipped them down to her ankles , showing the pink roulettes of the zipper on her inner thigh , and then she raised her legs playfully for Hood to get ap177grip . She was unembarrassed with her legs in the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way and pulling her boots off he felt no twinge of arousal . She said , " Stop looking at me knickers , you dirty devil . " Only then he looked and saw the wrinkle fitting the parrot beak of hair where she was narrowest . " Black ones . Very sexy . " " I bought a dozen . All colors . " " You 're a new woman , sweetheart , he said , tugging her boot , tipping her backward . " All these new clothes  --  you must have won the pools . " She looked away . " I do n't know . " He worked the second boot off , then she smiled and said , " Right . I won the pools . But it 's a secret . " " I hope it was a bundle . " " A packet  --  well , enough anyway . " In a resentful monotoneshe said , " He knew I wanted boots like these . But he always said no . Or a skirt  --  I used to wear skirts like these but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get other men to look at me . As if he did n't look at other women ! It was the same as the dog track . That 's where I met the fucker  --  at the dogs . My father took me there a few times , and then when he died I went with my girlfriends from work . Nothing serious  --  just for fun , like , a little flutter on a Thursday night . Made a change from going home to the telly . It was at the track one Thursday . Ron come over and chatted me up . He 's wearing this expensive suit , he tells me he 's something in insurance , full of talk . How am I supposed to know he 's a villain ? He was a heavy punter  --  always showing off with his money and talking about his connections . He knows this bloke on the continent , he 's got business with the Arabs . Then we got married and after that he would n't take me to the track . He went with his mates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for no married woman , ' he says . " Hood said , " But you 're not married anymore . " " No , " she said , and she looked so sad he thought she wasp178going to cry . She surprised him by saying , " He was a right bastard , he was . Sometimes I think , Poor bugger , he 's dead , ' then I remember how he used to treat me and I think , Good  --  the fucker deserved it . ' " " Maybe he had it coming to him . " " Maybe , maybe ! " she mocked . " Are you trying it on ? You always sound as if you 're defending him . " " Do I ? " She was quick ; he wondered if it was so . " Yes , you do . I tell you what an absolute fucker he was and all you do is nod your head and say , Oh , yeah , maybe you 're right . ' Jesus , whose side are you on ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . Even if they are fuckers . " " No , that 's not the reason , " she said . " I keep forgetting you 're one of them . You 're different , but you 're one of them . Why are n't you like the rest of them ? " He almost objected . He so easily forgot how he had come into her life ; then he remembered that he had introduced himself as one of the family . Had he said he was Weech 's friend ? He no longer knew . Lorna had told him all the other names , and he had given them faces and cruel teeth . He could not ask for any more , he could not reveal himself . It was too late for that : assumptions had to be taken for truth . He said , " Maybe I am like them . " " If you was , " she said fiercely , " if you really was , I would n't want to know you . " " Take it easy , sister , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I know they 're filth , " she said , tightening her mouth , pronouncing it , as Murf did , filf " They 've been over here . The other night  --  Monday , it was . Ernie  --  you know him , the little one , eyes like a rat , hair way down to here  --  Ernie come round . I thought it was you , so I let him in . Asking questions , but I knew he was n't listening to me . The fucker 's just going sniff , sniff . " " Why did n't you tell me this before ? "  | " I thought you knew , " she said . " Anyway , it do n't matter . " " Did he ask you about the stuff upstairs ? " " No . But I knew he was checking up . I could see the little fucker 's eyes . " " I should have known . " Hood was uneasy ; he did n't want to be exposed , but there was a greater danger for Lorna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . At once he saw how he had toyed with her affection  --  his victim 's wife was his victim : the thought repeated , more deliberately and so more cruelly . He said , " If they ever ask you about that loot , say you do n't know where it is . " " I do n't , do I ? " she said lightly . She was calm , she did n't know how unsafe she was . " Like I 've never been to your house , have I ? " " Right , " said Hood . " So you do n't know anything . " " I do n't want to know anything . " Hood said nothing . For a moment he thought of telling her everything , from the murder onward , but there was a threshold in every friendship which , once crossed , made the past a deception . Then , every explanation seemed like a suppression of a greater fact , and truth looking like a lie was an unforgivabletaunt . Noticing his silence she said , " Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure , " he said to stop her . Then , " You said you were going to show me the other clothes you bought . " " What 's the use ? There 's nowhere to go . I ca n't go shopping around here wearing stuff like that . The butcher 's , the news agent . They 'll take me for a tart . " " We 'll go somewhere , " said Hood , but he could not think where . They had only ever been to the park on Brookmill Road together and once to Greenwich to see the Cutty Sark and the Royal Observatory ( he told her about Verloc ; she said , " The fucker sounds like Ron " ) . " Where would you like to go ? " " How about the flicks ? " she said . " I can sit in the dark wearing my new gear . "  | " Come on , think of a place . " She said , " What I 'd really like to do is go to the dog track , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my father . He 'd find me a seat where it was warm and tell me which dogs to back . He 'd have a cup of tea with me and he 'd put his arm around me and keep the teds away . " She smiled sadly . " Sometimes we used to win . He always gave me half . " " We 'll do it , " said Hood . " Where is it  --  Catford ? We 'll win a bundle ! " " Not a chance , " she said . " What about the kid ? " " Get a babysitter , " he said . " You 've got the money . Remember , sister ? You won the pools . " She sat back and sighed , then she said , " I 'd love to go . There are races tonight . It 's Thursday . " " We 're going , " he said . " Okay , " she said , but she added quietly , " I did n't win no pools . It 's their money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't worry . ' And then , the next day , this thing came from the bank  --  fifty quid deposit . I do n't care , and maybe they ai n't such fuckers after all . But they probably stole it off Ron . "  |p181THE  RAILWAY ARCHES in the half-dark  --  the black brick spans  --  were shaped like the crust of a burnt-out cloister . They ran parallel to the poorly lighted road all the way from the station at Catford Bridge to the dog track . And there were dead monks underneath  --  or so it seemed to Hood , who preparing himself to enjoy the dog races had smoked a joint in the train  --  discarded cartons , peaked like the cowls of monks ' habits , lay on the ground , holy casualties in the broken place , feet and hands and covered heads , and an odor of ruin . Ahead he saw the greyhound motif , a starved lunging dog picked out in lights , but between the stadium entrance and where they now stood was this shadowy rising brickwork mottled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely legible , like the last messages of heathen raiders . The highlights were unexpected  --  rubbish that had the appearance of thick bushes and an impression of autumn foliage that was no more than the suggestion of darkness and the smells , verifying the dead cloister and giving it a further authority , the veiled aspect of a brittle engraving . And when the train rumbled on the spans and shook the yellow lamps on the line  --  but was itself hidden from this road  --  the sound raised the tattered smell again and corrected the engraved dimension the silence had imposed : the noise loosened it all and gave it brief life for the duration of the passing train . Lorna said , " I always used to be afraid of this road . " " I like it , " said Hood . " Well , maybe because I saw a bloke nobbled here , " she said . " I mean , killed . " It had a name , this puddly two hundred yards : Adenmorep182Road . London was closely mapped . No city he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an inaccurate caption , and even the wild place , the sudden hill of hiding trees above Peckham where he 'd dumped Weech 's body  --  that , too , had a name . Hood was surprised when Lorna chose the second-class enclosure instead of the more expensive one . At the turnstile she said it was the one she had always used with her father . The stadium was gaily lit with strings of colored bulbs , and Hood could see the smoke drifting up from the various enclosures to the floodlights on tall poles , as if the whole circus were cozily smoldering . There was no shouting , only a low roar of voices . " There 's the dogs , " said Lorna . " Way over there . " The first race was about to begin . Across the track , on the far side of the stadium , six girls in hunting clothes marched in single file . Each held a sleek dog on a leash , and the sharp snouts and thin bodies were silhouetted in the lights like black metal cutouts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the lights and came towards the near grandstand , and up close Hood could see how young the girls were , how skinny the dogs  --  tottering on bony paws , panting in their tight wire muzzles . " Are n't you going to bet on this race ? " asked Hood , looking down at his program . " Too late , " said Lorna . " I always watch the dogs in the paddock before I bet . Here , they all look the same , but out back you can tell which ones are fast . That 's what my father used to say . " They stood talking under the first-class enclosure which , glassed-in and high , was at the brow of the grandstand . The steamy windows were full of red-faced people who sat at tables , eating , holding pint glasses , watching the track . " Ron always went up there , so he could act big , " said Lorna . She led Hood to the side of the grandstand , where people were marking programs on the terraces and hurrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the bookies , at the rail . The bookies worked rapidly at blackboards , some on stools signaled the odds with gloved hands to the far side of the stadium  --  pointing and clapping like deaf mutes , while the men beside them spat on their fingers and wiped numbers from the columns on the boards and added new ones . They gave a hectic motion to the race that was like the instant before panic . Each one had a satchel with his name on it , Sam &; Alec , Jimmy Gent , Pollard Turf Acc'ts , and as the starting time grew near the activity around these men became frenzied as cash was exchanged for tickets . In this excitement Hood saw the pleasure of risk ; the very sight of the men gambling aroused his desire for Lorna . On the track , men in white smocks were heaving the metal traps into position . " You 're going to win tonight , " said Hood . " If I won a lot of money I 'd take a holiday , " said Lorna . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Check into one of them big white hotels on the front and look at the sea from the balcony . I always wanted to do that , live in a posh hotel and look at the sea . " " We 'll do it , " said Hood . " First we have to win . " The dogs were being unleashed and helped into the traps , one by one , and Hood could hear them whimpering . They did n't bark ; because of their muzzles they gave low curiously human wails , an odd lonely sound in that festive crowd of gamblers . Then the lights went out in all the enclosures and in the darkness there was silence , a hush that amplified the moans of the dogs . In the black stadium the only light was the yellow gleaming sand of the track . And over the moans a murmur that grew to a whine : the mechanical rabbit speeding towards the traps . As the rabbit shot past , the traps sprang open and the dogs leaped out , stretching themselves after it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only distinct sound was the rabbit singing on the wire , a humming heightened by an occasional twang.  | " Five 's ahead , " said Lorna . Hood heard her clearly . Instead of shouts there was intense concentration . It was not like a horse race where spectators screamed at the jockeys and jumped and waved their arms . This was studied enthusiasm , a kind of breathless suspense . A man behind Hood said in what was nearly a whisper , " Come on you two dog . " The dogs sprinted past , and it was still so quiet in the grandstand that Hood could hear their toiling gasps and the scrape and skid of their paws on the track . When they rounded the last bend there was a little cheer , scattered shouts of anger or glee which ended the moment the dogs crossed the finish line : relief , jostling , and some laughter  --  and a flurry of losers scattering tickets at their feet . " Let 's go round to the paddock , " said Lorna . " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " whispered Hood . " They 're saying , Who 's that fantastic chick ? ' " She laughed . " You 're dreaming . " But she looked down at her new boots in prim admiration . He had never seen her so happy , and he imagined a life with her : a safe monotony , without incident , surrendering to Deptford , the pub , the bed , the child , the dog track , the weekend in Brighton . He wanted more , but he was tempted by less , and he sometimes felt this , passing the window of a south London parlor and envying the people inside having tea with their elbows on the table . He could save her that way ; he saw in her the sad aging of every lost soul  --  and it was true loss , since she had no notion of how she had been widowed . But what kept him from pushing the reverie further was not that it was a retreat from the life he had planned for himself but that underlying this obvious feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love . He followed her behind the grandstand to the paddock . Here it was damp , enclosed and yet open to the sky . It was divided by a sturdy metal fence . On the other side was a small shed ; a few over-bright bulbs inside the shed lighted patches of grass where they stood . The rest of the lights were aimed at thep185closed doors of thirty numbered stalls built against the brick embankment of the railway line . These narrow cupboards rattled with the whimpering of the dogs locked inside  --  their wails carried , as they had from the traps , and Hood was alarmed by their frantic pawings on the wooden doors . The paddock was empty , but the cries of the dogs , and the dampness , the spiked fence and the spotlights that showed nothing but locked doors , gave it the appearance of a tortuous jail compound . Hood wanted to go . Lorna said , " Wait  --  here they come . " Shivering , blinking and scratching at their numbered vests , the dogs were dragged into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caps and jodhpurs . Then a bowler-hatted man in brown gaiters  --  the starter  --  checked their collars and tried their vests to see they were securely fastened . Men , a dozen or more , had gathered at the fence to watch this simple ceremony , and they conferred in whispers , singling out particulardogs with cautious nods . " Number Two looks like he wants a kip , " said Lorna . " But that Number Three 's a lively one . Got a strong back . " She opened her program . " Lucky Gold  --  nice name . " Hood leaned to her ear . " Who are these apes hanging on the fence ? " " Villains , " said Lorna , confidentially . " It 's a crooked sport  --  attracts all the villains , like Ron and them fuckers . But my father told me what to look out for . Right here , before the race , you can spot the slow ones . " " That mutt looks like he 's limping . " " The villains step on their toes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mashed . Or they give them a drink of water . Sometimes  --  straight  --  they put chewing gum up their arses . Anything to slow them up . But Number Three , Lucky Gold , he looks a fast one , he does . He 's going to win . " " All this poncing about , " a man clutching the fence said loudly . " That clot 's just wasting time  --  they could have been around the track by now . "  | " Cheap , " said another man , " filthy cheap  --  " As he spoke there was a rumbling above the paddock , an approaching train . The warning was brief ; the train thundered by a moment later , flashing across the arches overhead , a rapid intrusion of banging wheels drowning the voices and the dogs ' whimpers . The yellow windows blurred and lengthened to a ribbon by the speed . The paddock shook and the eyes of the dogs being led out bulged in fear over the muzzles . For seconds the paddock was darkened by the loud clatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the dogs , and Hood went with Lorna to the front of the grandstand , to a window with the sign Win and Place . " How much are you betting ? " She said , " A pound on Number Three to place . " " A pound to place ? But you said he 's going to win ! " " Who knows ? " " Put your money where your mouth is , " said Hood . " Play to win  --  why hedge ? " " Because I might lose the lot , nitwit . " " If you 're worried about losing you should n't be betting . " " It 's just a flutter , " she said . " Bit of fun . Little gamble . " " Bullshit , " he said , and she seemed amazed by how serioushe had become . He growled , " If it ai n't risky , sweetheart , itai n't gambling . " " The big villain , " she said . He snatched her money and stepped past her to the window . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took the tickets and handed them to her : " Now watch that bitch run . " He put his arm around her and kissed her . They walked arm in arm to an empty place on the grandstand steps . It was to be a long race , over five hundred meters , so the traps were across the stadium from the finishing line . But even at that distance the dogs ' howls were loud , and they carried from the far side  --  long anxious wails from the barred traps . The lights went off and only the track shone , a sugary yellow ; the rabbit started its circuit and the wire sang again . The traps banged open.  |p187It  was not clear until the dogs passed them which one was ahead , but at the turn they saw the number four dog balk and the white vest of Number Three flash to the front . " He 's in the lead ! " said Lorna . The pack darted after him , the lean dogs sprinting beautifully , low to the ground , almost horizontal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the speed . Their names were absurd  --  Kelowna Gem , Tawny Perch , Aerial Miss , Star Beyond  --  but for half a minute their names mattered , and Lucky Gold jostled with the blue-vested number two dog , Act On , for first place . They had circled the stadium once and were now leaping around the last curve . Hood saw the second dog slowing and Lucky Gold 's slender head shoot across the finish line in a burst of light as the photo was taken . Lorna screamed delightedly . Hood said , " You 're rolling in it , " and helped her collect her winnings at the pay-out window . After that win of nearly thirty pounds , they bet in the same way on the next two races , going behind to the paddock and choosing the liveliest dog before placing the bet . But both dogs lost ; one was fast away but finished fourth , the other came in second . Lorna said , " I told you we should have got place tickets . " " Forget it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's go up there and you can buy me a drink . " " We ca n't go there  --  you need a blue program for that enclosure . They 'll chuck us out . " The first-class enclosure was just above them , a lighted ledge . They were at the margin of the track , away from the men crowding the bookies . " There 's your friend , " said Lorna . Hood was looking at the twinkling lights on the far side . It was a pleasing circus , a fine way of playing at risk . He said , " Who ? " " Willy Rutter . " Seeing Hood squint she added , " Do n't pretend you do n't know him . He 's up there . " She frowned and pointed to a man leaning against " Hood said , " I see him . " The dark-haired man , bulked at the glass , was gesturing , motioning in a friendly way . The light behind him blackened his face and showed how his hair was fluffed at his ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hood could see how mistakenly he had characterized the man . He had imagined a thug and given him a heavy jaw and fangs and an ape 's shoulders . This was a smaller creature than he had pictured in his mind , a man who looked like a car salesman , waving with sham geniality . The man turned aside to face the light and Hood saw a smile on his pouchy face . " He wants us to go up , " said Lorna . " I 'm not going , " said Hood , and without looking again at Rutter he steered Lorna quickly to the bar at the top of the second-class enclosure . He ordered drinks and said , " Are n't we going to bet on this race ? " Lorna shrugged . " I should have known we 'd see Willy here . I 'll bet he 's with the rest of them . I do n't want to talk to him . " " Then drink up and we 'll go . " " Go ? What for ? I 'm not leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hood looked for the man 's face , the stringy head in the crowd . There 's your friend : the man would expose him , and if he was exposed it was all over . The friendship he had contrived with Lorna would be proved a fraud ; he would lose her . He did not worry about himself , but he feared for her . He said , " Let 's go around back . " " What 's the rush ? We can give this one a miss . There 's still one more race . I 'll put a tenner on the last race  --  I 've never bet a tenner before . " They watched the preparations for the race , a handicap with staggered traps in pairs along the last stretch . When the lights went out and the race began , Hood said , " Let 's go to the paddock now . " He did not wait for a reply . He helped her through the darkness of the enclosure , taking care not to alertp189her that he was running away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he instinctively looked for another exit . Seeing none he felt cornered . Lorna was at the fence , examining the dogs . The fence was a semicircle , gateless , meeting the hack of the grandstand at one end and joined to the gangway , leading to the track , at the other . Beyond it , above the dogs ' stalls , was the railway . He was trapped . The dogs began to moan loudly , a wolfish baying that made his own throat dry . " I 've seen all I want , " said a man near Lorna , and he started away . The rest of the men left and the dogs themselves were led out . The dogs ' close pelts gave them a look of nakedness , exaggerating their skinny , punished bodies , and they shook as they trotted beside the fence . From trap to trap , with the interruption of a futile chase : the agony was as familiar to flood as waking to life . He said , " So let 's go . " " I have n't made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It never fails . " He took her arm and tried to hurry her , but as he turned , the paddock entrance , that small alley , filled with three men . " There she is , " one said , and the men started towards them . The smallest , whom Hood took to be Rutter , was in the middle ; the two others marched at his elbows . " Here comes trouble , " said Lorna into her hand . Hood faced them . The paddock was empty  --  the dogs , the attendants , the starter had gone for the last race , and Hood could hear the voice quacking on the loudspeaker , urging people to place their bets : Ladies and gentlemen , the race will begin in three minutes . In the paddock there were only the cries of the dogs locked in their stalls , and the light broken by posts and trees into blocks of shadow that half-hid the approaching men . " Hello , Willy . " " Lorna , baby , " he said . " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hood said , " We were just leaving . "  | " Who are you ? " As Rutter spoke the two other men drew close to Hood , preventing him from moving on . " He a friend of yours , Lorna ? " said Rutter . " What if he is ? " she said . " You 're in the way , " said Hood . " We 're betting on this race . " " I got a tip for you , " said Rutter . He lifted his hands and pointed at Hood . " Start talking . " " Put your cock-scratchers back in your pocket or I 'll break them off . " " You did n't answer my question . You one of the family ? " " Who wants to know ? " said Hood snarling and trying to keep back from the men so that they could n't slip behind him . A dog began to yelp from his box and he started more shrill baying from the others . Rutter said , " Because if you 're one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you 're crowbaring in , and the thing is , we 're looking after Lorna . Are n't we , baby ? " " I can look after myself , " she said . " Ron was a mate of mine , " said Rutter . " More than business . We done each other favors . When he copped it I cried like he was my own brother . " " Get out of the way , shorty , " said Hood . " Do n't push your luck , " said Rutter . " You can go if you want , but Lorna and me are going to have a little chat . Come on , baby , leave this geezer . " He went to put his arm around Lorna , but as he did Hood chopped at his shoulder and Rutter staggered back . Lorna screamed , and from the far side of the grandstand there was the muffled bang of the traps opening , the snare-drum mutter of the crowd , the whine of the fleeing rabbit . Rutter clutched his bruised shoulder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do him ! " The taller of the two came at Hood , but the men were working to a plan he saw only when it was too late . As Hood prepared to throw Fred off , the second man jumped him fromp191behind and began kicking him . Hood felt Fred tearing at his sleeve and he tried to swing on him , but still he felt the weight of the other on his back , choking him and booting his legs and trying to drag him down . Lorna was screaming still , and there was more noise : the thunder of the train above the dogs ' howls , the deafening clatter of the tracks banging above the railway embankment . He imagined from her shrieking that Lorna had been pounced on , and he tried to reach her . But the sound smothered him and as he stumbled he sensed the paddock 's lights tipping into his eyes . He was being pulled in two directions ; he fought to stay upright and he felt warm blood trickling down his legs and gathering in his shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's grip loosened on him . He heard strangled woofs . He steadied himself to hammer the nearest man when he heard an excited stutter . " If anyone moves , this fucker gets it in the chops . " Murf held Rutter 's head in the crook of his elbow . They were almost the same size , both very short , but Murf had a demon 's insect face , his earring twitched back and forth , and he stood just behind Rutter in a grotesque embrace , as if he were about to devour him . He had jabbed his hunting knife under the knot of Rutter 's tie and he was moving it menacingly against his throat . Rutter had gone white , and for a moment Hood imagined the knife halfway through his windpipe . The men backed away from Hood . Lorna ran to the exit , stumbling in her new boots . Hood went over to Murf , who still hugged Rutter tightly . Murf said , " You want to put the boot in ? " " Drop him , " said Hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Murf swung Rutter around , gagging him with the knife at his throat . Using the same childlike plea he had at the house  --  as if there were no knife , no thugs , as if they were alone  --  he said , " Now can I come wif you ? " " Come on , brother . "  |p195ONCE  THE BOAT was out of sight of Tower Bridge , traveling downriver on this bleak backwater lined with ghostly rotting warehouses , there were no more landmarks to distract her , and her memory was buoyed by the river 's surge . Her mind began to move with ' the current . So much better than the bounce and stink of a taxi , though at first on the excursion boat she had felt only nausea . She had been struck by the discomfort , the choppy water under the gray sky , and up close she could see that what she had taken for turbulence were chunks of rocking flotsam , the arm of a chair , a cupboard door , a greasy eel of rope , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waves . Like the boat itself : a deception . She had seen it gliding towards the quay at Westminster and had a foretaste of pleasure ; but on board , the engine droned against her feet and set her teeth on edge , and then she worried that the flimsy craft might go under , slip beneath the water 's garish tincture of chemicals and sink before she gained the embankment walls . She was sickened by the motion and noise and bad air , and she decided that she had been so far from the boat and water she had mistaken clumsiness for grace . She had reached for something tranquil and seized disorder ; her snaring hands had put the peaceful bird to flight . The boat was frantic ; it tipped and rattled ; the smell of gas made her dizzy . The four other passengers huddled at the edges of the cabin like stowaways . The windows were splashed , but there was nothing to see except a zone of water distorting her landmarks and suddenly the rusty hull of a looming tug she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its ark of sewage . That was at the beginning of the trip . The wind had wrinkledp196the river 's surface , she had been cold . The late-October chill had settled , an afternoon in the afternoon of the year , reminding her  --  as foul weather invariably did  --  of her age . But now the landmarks were gone and the river carried the boat and her thoughts ; she remembered her errand . Her discomfort helped her to reflect : she knew she was playing a role that required moments of furtiveness , an anonymity she sometimes craved . She had asked for this accidental hour on the river to keep her appointment on Greenwich pier for the meeting later ; she needed all the props of secrecy for her mood . So after the first shock of the boat , the feeling she wanted to shout , the dread she was going to vomit , the window 's dampness prickling her face and that icicle jammed in her spine  --  after all that , she saw how right it was and she enjoyed its appropriateness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretense warmed her . And , as always , enjoyment was a prelude to greed : she wanted to buy a boat , think of a name for it , hire an ex-convict to pilot it , moor it beside Cheyne Walk , and give a party on the deck . Downriver , down its gray throat , seaward , the boat was borne : she could think here . When our brother Fire was having his dog 's day . . . Instinct , no more , had brought her this far . She had always struggled to find among the choices within her the truest expression of her will . She had groped to show herself the way through her wealth . Like the painting . That theft . It had been so embarrassing at the time she had only felt exposed and had not seen the simplest thing  --  that she might have managed it all herself , upstaged the thieves and been the triumphant victim of her own plot . She wished she had been involved from the very beginning . But she had discovered it soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more curious . She had once thought of selling everything and giving away the proceeds , pouring it all into the river of common hope  --  like this river beneath her , murky and slow  --  to speed the current and cause a flooding so great they 'd be knee-deep in it in dreary places like Cricklewood and Brixton . But there were otherp197stratagems ( anyway , charity was the century 's most deliberate fraud  --  what were her do-gooding parents but pious cheats ? ) , and of ( them theft was the greatest . The stolen painting taught her to see her role in a different way . She thought : perhaps I have spent my whole life encouraging people to steal from me , because I have been too timid to give . The most outrageous reply to money was the only one . She had improved on Bakunin  --  using privilege to rid herself of privilege . She wished for others to do violence to her wealth and yet to have her own say in their acts . She deserved to be the victim and yet she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set for herself . She wished to be both the terrorist and the terrorized . Her own painting hung as hostage in the upstairs room of the Deptford house showed her how central she was to the drama of disorder , how her importance confounded simplicity and made all the layers of travesty political . It was like Twelfth Night in Holloway Women 's Prison : the woman chosen to play the man 's part was disguised as a woman , who was revealed as a man who was offstage a woman . And how far she 'd come ! Until she had discovered the complications of the theft her most revolutionary idea had been to sack Mrs. Pount . She thought : Give the dog a bone . She could feel the boat 's progress , the splashings at her elbow , the window 's mist on her cheek . The painting had redeemed her and , most of all , that theft was one in the eye for Araba . She had stopped visiting Hill Street . She said she was too busy . But Lady Arrow knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with the Peter Pan business  --  those rehearsals would n't start for weeks . No , a needless sense of rivalry had sharpened in Araba . She too had money ; she had prominence ; she had her group , the militant actors who had done little but give themselves a name  --  the Purple League  --  and disrupt Equity meetings . Play-acting with costumes and aliases , their substitute for action . A mob of howling fairies , frenzied because the best parts went to younger stars who did n't lisp  --  amazing how many actors in the Leaguep198had speech impediments or were too short . They got noisier until they landed a place with some safe repertory company and then they fell silent : politics was a way to fame , Marxism to wealth ; the furious little Trots wanted to be film stars ! Araba believed in them , or said she did ; she staged their pageants , led the attacks on the Punch and Judy shows , chaired their meetings , loaned them money . If they disappointed her she expelled them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Araba had said . I t was not an invitation . Only an actress celebrated as Lady Macbeth could exclude you by seeming to invite you . But she believed , in spite of her mockery . Of all the people Lady Arrow had ever known only actors had been able to combine power with glamour ; and the best were gods , moving easily from world to world . They made you believe in that pretense . More than their friendship Lady Arrow wanted their loyalty . It would be like owning the priests who officiated at the public ceremonies of a popular religion . It was , she knew , an irrational trust that she had , but she could not help it . Actors lived in a way she would have chosen for herself ; they could be anyone and they could persuade others to believe in their masks . She guessed they were weak , but she seldom saw their weakness and for them to make weakness seem like power filled her with approval . More than that , she saw how in organizing plays in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them  --  and what prisoner would criticize her acting ability ? This was her unspoken answer to Araba , and a way of proving to herself that she could act well . The more Araba avoided her , the more she tried to divine how she might make the actress dependent , and then they could conspire together . She wanted to be included , but Araba kept her away , as if encouraging the rivalry . Money did not enter into it  --  so much the better . But Lady Arrow had gathered that Araba did not trust her , did not quite believe the principles Lady Arrow claimed for herself . She seemed to imply in her disbelief that Lady Arrow had a fictitious ambition . Or was she demandingp199proof  --  a tactic for ignoring her  --  because she was not interested in her ? Araba might even be on the verge of expelling her in some casual way . Today , Lady Arrow had invited herself and Araba had allowed it with reluctance , showing interest only when Lady Arrow had said , " I 'm not coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Who ? " " One of my prisoners . " The river stopped , then her thoughts ; the boat was turning , hooting . The spattered windows revealed nothing but the water 's cold light . The engine was still . The boat bumped . Lady Arrow guessed they 'd arrived at Greenwich . She walked unsteadily to the ladder and climbed to the deck . Brodie was at the top of the ramp , waving . Seeing her , Lady Arrow felt a helpless exalted hunger for the girl , something physical tightening in her that made her strength clumsy . Desire seldom activated her mind  --  it pulsed at her throat and made her flesh burn as with the onset of fever . It was always like this : it broke her in two and one half hid from the other , like shame from pride . She rushed up to Brodie and kissed her , feeling huge , hoping she did not look foolish and yet not caring . She saw she had startled the young girl with her tongue and teeth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough in that jacket ? " " I 'm all right . I liberated it from a secondhand shop . " It was a school blazer , with a badge and a Latin motto on the breast pocket . Under it Brodie wore a thin jersey . The wind whipped at her lapels and pushed her long dress against her small thighs . " We 've got a stiffish walk , " said Lady Arrow , feeling guilty to he so warmly dressed in a heavy coat and thick scarf . " Why do n't we have a drink at the Trafalgar before we set off ? " " I do n't drink , " said Brodie , " but I 'll keep you company . " They walked on the riverside path in front of the Naval College to the Trafalgar , where Lady Arrow ordered a double whisky . Brodie excused herself and by the time she returned Lady Arrow had finished her drink . Brodie was brighter ,  |p200laughing  to herself and staring with glazed hilarity at Lady Arrow . " Have you taken a pill or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Brodie . " You mean you can smell it on me ? " " Rather , " said Lady Arrow ; then she sniffed . " You said we were meeting this heavy actress . I always turn on before I meet people . " Outside , Lady Arrow said , " In my favorite novel there 's a lovely scene here in Greenwich  --  an outing , like this . Do you know Henry James ? " " Never heard of him . " " That 's much better than knowing his name and not reading him . " She looked at the young girl 's white face and thought : she knows nothing  --  she is free . They cut across the park and climbed the path that led around the front of the Observatory to a road and a little hill . Although it was only midafternoon the light was failing and the ground darkening with an intimation of shadows ; and the air had thickened , so that the trees that led to the far end of the hill , where some tennis courts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was like cigarette smoke . And now the Observatory looked distant , like an old Dutch mansion on a promontory of a gray green sea . " How is my friend Mister Hood ? " " He 's not around much . I think he 's got a chick . " " Has he ? " Lady Arrow was momentarily jealous , then she was calm : she was with Brodie . This was what she had wanted most . " He seems quite a remarkable man . " " He 's pretty heavy . " " You must bring him over to Hill Street . " Brodie laughed . " He wo n't come . He do n't like you . " Lady Arrow stopped walking . She said , " Why not ? " Brodie went a few more paces , then turned and said , " He'dgo crazy if he knew I was meeting you . He told Murf and mep201not to see you . He says it 's not our scene . You 'll fuck us up . " " Do you think I will ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's not my father . He ca n't tell me what to do . " " Good girl , " said Lady Arrow , and seeing that they were alone and surrounded by trees she stooped and put her arm around the girl 's small shoulders . Crushing the blazer she pulled her close  --  even in those thin clothes Brodie was warm . Lady Arrow said , " I 'd like to adopt you  --  legally . Then we could be together all the time . " Brodie looked up and smiled . " You 'd be my mother . Really weird . " " I 'd be a nice mother , " said Lady Arrow , then urgently she said , " Let me . " Brodie shrugged . " I 'd feel funny . " " We could go to bed and have all our secrets there . " Brodie squinted , as if she had just then forgotten something she had always known . " I 've shocked you , " said Lady Arrow . " No , " said Brodie . " A chick fancied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it with her . " " So you know how beautiful it is . " Brodie screwed up her face , pretending a look of comic disgust , seeming to swallow something foul . " Do n't you ? " said Lady Arrow . Brodie was shaking her head . She said , " Yuck ! " Then she was running across the humpy top of the hill , her hair flying like a pennant as she ducked around trees , growing smaller . Lady Arrow watched : she was out of reach , running away as children always did , making no allowance for the very slow . The afternoon mist and low sky made a great brown canvas of the park on which Brodie was an elusive flag of paint among the trees , a brushstroke . Lady Arrow leaned into the steep path and trudged towards the darting figure . She stopped several times to get her breath and felt almost defeated knowingp202she was chasing her in the most hopeless way and could only catch her if the girl allowed it . In the living room of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not one of your prisoners , is she ? " " I thought you 'd like her . " " She 's spoiled and she 's too young . " Araba sipped her mug of coffee . The mug was chipped , her jeans were stained with paint and bleach , and she sat on the arm of the sofa with a kind of awkward arrogance , like a workman in a large strange house . " I 've had it up to here with these rich girls playing at politics . " " You must be joking , " said Lady Arrow , and she laughed at the thought of Brodie being considered rich . But she was vindicated in her belief : Araba had taken the girl 's carelessness  --  poverty 's legacy  --  for freedom . She saw that Araba was annoyed and said , " She 's the real thing . " " I ca n't stand her affectations . That blazer is a dead giveaway . " " She liberated it from a secondhand shop . " " Really , Susannah , you should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many people who need attention  --  why pick on one of your own ? " " So that 's why you 're being rude to her . " " She 's not my type . " " She 'd be interested in your work . " " My work would scare the daylights out of her . " Brodie entered the room holding McGravy 's dog . She said , " He thought he could get away from me , but I was too fast for him . " " Poldy 's got high blood pressure , " said Araba . " Do be careful with him . " " How do you like Araba 's new house ? " said Lady Arrow . " Far out , " said Brodie . " But ours is bigger , ai n't it ? You can play hide-and-seek in ours . " Lady Arrow saw Araba 's ears move in satisfaction . She said ,  | " Brodie lives in a marvelous old house in Deptford with her friends . " " I imagine that must make your parents absolutely furious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , " said Brodie . " And my mother , she do n't have a clue . " Lady Arrow said , " I think Brodie would get on terribly well with your friend Anna , that pretty little Trot . " " We expelled her , " said Araba . " They 're always expelling people , " said Lady Arrow to Brodie . " They 're famous for it . It sounds such fun . I once thought of expelling Mrs. Pount , but she 'd be ever so sad if I did . " " It 's not funny , " said Araba . " I was expelled myself not long ago . " " Who would do a thing like that ? " said Lady Arrow . " I ca n't go into it  --  not in present company . " The women were on chairs , facing each other across twenty feet of carpet , in the center of which Brodie sat cross-legged , playing with the dog . She was like a bored child forced indoors by her aunts , who made an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who spoke with self-conscious care , knowing they had a young listener . " And how is Peter Pan ? " said Lady Arrow . " They have n't expelled you from that , I hope . " " Rehearsals start in a few weeks , " said Araba . " It 's a headache  --  I 've got so many other things to do . I have to take lessons on the wire . It 's a complete bore , learning to fly . " " It sounds super , " said Lady Arrow . " Did you hear that , my love  --  she 's learning to fly ! " " When I was at the home , " said Brodie , " they took us to see Peter Pan one Christmas . " " And did you like it ? " asked Lady Arrow . " The part with the pirates was pretty freaky , " said Brodie . " I ca n't remember the rest . I think it was too long . " " Your political affairs must take up a great deal of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Brodie.  | " The League ? It 's the only thing that keeps me sane . " " How many members do you have ? " " That 's a reporter 's question , Susannah . You know better than to ask that . " " I love secrets , " said Lady Arrow . " I only wish I had some myself . Perhaps I do ! " " How did you get into it ? " asked Brodie , holding the dog on her lap and letting him gnaw her wrist . " Historical necessity , " said Araba . " It had to happen . You ca n't ignore what 's going on around you . You take it for just so long and then something snaps . " " I never thought of it that way , " said Brodie . " It can be a very humbling thing to know how much power you really have . I 'm not talking about playing around with it , the political protest wank that only makes you feel good  --  that does n't change anything . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands , just like you  --  " Brodie was shaking her head , laughing softly and stroking the dog . " I can see you 're not very impressed , " said Araba . " But I 'll lend you a book if you like . " " I read one . " " And what did you think of it ? " " Too long , " said Brodie . " There speaks the voice of innocence  --  innocence is a form of laziness , is n't it ? The young and their all-purpose comments . I must remember that  --  it was too long ! " " It 's probably a fair comment , " said Lady Arrow . " I do n't know . I 'm hopelessly out of my depth with political theory . " Araba said , " I 'm so sick of the young , I 'm so tired of hearing about them and seeing them courted . " She turned to Brodie and said crossly , " You do n't know anything , but if you listen you 'll see you have a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You might be surprised , " said Araba . Brodie said , " I could never play Peter Pan . "  | " Oh , lord , " said Lady Arrow . " Did n't I tell you ? " " It 's not that the book was boring , " Brodie explained . " I liked the pirates . But the flying ! I 'd freak out on that wire . I 'm afraid of heights . " " Tell her about the League , " said Lady Arrow . " I do n't want to alarm her , " said Araba . " She wo n't be alarmed . " " Then she wo n't understand . " " I 'm stupid , " said Brodie . " Right ? That 's what you 're saying . I 'm stupid  --  I do n't know nothing . " Araba blushed slightly and said , " We 're mainly Trots , but some are outright anarchists or anarchosyndicalists . Are you with me ? " The dog barked . Brodie giggled and patted him . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the existing power structure of hacks and exploiters . " Araba got to her feet . " It 's a party committed to action on all fronts . " " I like parties , " said Brodie . " She 's really quite passionate , " said Lady Arrow . " Stuff your praise , " said Araba . " We 're not part-timers . And I warn you we 're not joking . Any corrupt government is bound to fail  --  this one will , and when it does we 'll be there to take over . " " Then you 'll be the big shits , " said Brodie . " No , " said Araba , " because then we 'll hand it over to the people . " " The word people ' is so bald , " said Lady Arrow . " People '  --  that 's what politicians say . Who are they , the people ? " " They 're , like , mainly the straights , are n't they ? " said Brodie . " It 's everyone except the freaks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Arrow . " I do n't think you want to hear anymore , " said Araba . " I think Brodie would like you to be specific , " said Lady Arrow . " You 've been awfully abstract with your people and your grassroots . "  | " I could scare you with specifics . " " Go on , try , " said Lady Arrow , and she sat forward and took a pinch of snuff . " Well , for one thing , we have n't ruled out the possibility of confrontation . " Brodie said , " Hey , what 's this dog 's name again ? " " I mean direct action , " said Araba , ignoring Brodie . " In a word , Susannah  --  violence . " " Bombs , " said Lady Arrow . " Oh , bombs , " said Brodie , chucking Poldy under the jaw , making him growl . " It frightens you , does n't it ? " said Araba . " Only if I think about it a little , " said Brodie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done up with sticking plaster and that , they can blow up when you 're legging them . " " I would n't know about that , " said Araba , but her green eyes were electric and she looked closely at Brodie . " I 'm telling you straight , " said Brodie . " Sometimes they go wrong . Say the hands get muddled up and they 're touching the screw and you ca n't see them . They 're so feeble you can hardly tell when it 's legged anyway . Then you twist the wires over and as soon as they , like , touch , it 's the last act , ai n't it ? " " What does that mean ? " said Araba . " You 've had it . You 're snuffed . You 're wiped out . " Lady Arrow stared at her . She had been on the point of taking some more snuff , but she stopped her hand halfway to her nose and held it there , at shoulder level and a little forward , as if resting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you some experience of these things , my darling ? " " A little bit , " said Brodie , and hung her head . " It 's considered very fashionable to know a bomber , " said Araba . " A few years ago it was Yorkshiremen . Then it was Africans . Now it 's bombers . Your girlfriends must envy you . " " I do n't have no girlfriends . " " Well , your gang . "  | " 1t 's not a gang , " said Brodie . " It 's more a bunch of people . A family , like . " Lady Arrow said , " I 've met a number of them . They 're quite impressive . " " I 'm sure , " said Araba . " It sounds a great hoot . After that , our League would strike you as rather dull . " " If you 're into bovver , " said Brodie , " it might not be so bad . " " I take it you are into bother , as you say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ai n't it ? You said so yourself  --  everything 's rotten . It 's a ripoff . " " But what 's your program ? " " Bovver , " said Brodie . " Just bovver . " " She 's a Trot way down , " said Lady Arrow proudly . " A true anarchist . " " I doubt very much whether she knows the word . " " I do n't , " said Brodie . " It sounds like some creepy church . " " You see ? " said Lady Arrow . " No theories . It 's as simple asfootball . I love her directness . You should listen to her , Araba . " " You 're welcome to stay , " said Araba . " We 've got plenty of room . " " She ca n't . " " If Hood do n't find out , it 's all right , " said Brodie . " No , you 're coming with me , " said Lady Arrow . " We cancome back tomorrow . Or better still , Araba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Hood ? " Araba knelt in front of Brodie , who still held the dog on her lap . " It 's this bloke , " said Brodie . " You 're going to miss your lesson , " said Lady Arrow standing up . Araba looked at her watch and frowned in impatience . " Damn , " she said , " I 've got to go . But tell me something , Brodie  --  " Lady Arrow went to the door and called Brodie : she was208insistent , demanding in the tone a tired mother might use that Brodie follow her , but the fucking child would n't move . She said , " I 'm going , " but did n't go . She watched the small girl onthe floor answering the actress 's questions . " Do n't keep her , my darling , " said Lady Arrow sharply . " She 's learning to fly ! "  |p209THEY  ARRIVED LATE at Paddington Cemetery in Kilburn , and walking down the central path between the close rows of tombstones  --  following Mayo 's instructions  --  Murf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Queen 's Park Station Murf had said , " Wait , " and when the other passengers had gone he took a felt-tipped pen from his pocket and wrote ARSENAL RULE on the wall . He did it purposefully , clinging to the tiles with one hand and making the letters line by line like a child copying his name . He inked them in heavily . Then he walked away and turned to squint at it . He was not satisfied ; he wrote it again on the wall next to the door , while Flood watched him with puzzled amusement . " I 'm really sorry about that , " Murf was saying in a low voice . His feet scuffed the gravel regretfully . The long black raincoat he had bought to match Hood 's flapped about him , beating like a cape in the wind . " I think I made us late . " Ah fink . He slouched ahead , his coat rising , and he kicked at the path as if blaming himself by punishing his feet . The cemetery was in darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole place in shadow , whitening only the tops of the tombstones so that they were like peaks of ice chunks frozen in a still black pool . Outside the cemetery the air was soaked pale yellow , like a low cloud of poison , the effect of the sodium street lamps . The sound of their footsteps was deadened by the baffles of the tombs and they could hear their words ring once at the edge of the path and die as the echoes were stifled against the dark marble blocks . A black pool of ice ; but when they had crossed it several times Hood saw the cemetery as a walled-in ruin , the sturdy cellar of an ancient toppled building , with thep210rows of its foundation stones exposed  --  these broken steeples and cracked posts , and their chains and scabs of moss , pushed up to the path . The ones that caught the light were chalky and pitted like old bones , and the wind groaned through them , making the cluttered place seem mournfully empty . This was how the whole of London might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles of shallow moaning cellars . Hood said  --  and he was careful not to laugh  --  " Do you always write that ? " The previous night , at the dog track , Murf had stopped running to mark the same slogan on the exit gate  --  a rash afterthought , since they had no way of knowing whether they were being chased by Rutter 's men . Even fleeing , Murf had paused to use his felt-tip ! On the platform at Catford Bridge he had explained , " If you do it right , it sort of jumps out at you . " " Habit , " Murf said . He gathered his coat against the wind . " Couple of years ago I lived up in Penge . Arfa and me . And we had these mates . We called ourselves the Penge Boys '  --  boot-boys , like . I was a kid , about fifteen at the time , I was . Yeah , I was had up  --  threatenin ' behavior , utterin ' menaces  --  but I got off easy . We just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , Penge Rule , " Wankers Support Palace , ' that kind of shit . Then you started calling the house a flipping arsenal  --  remember ? When you saw me clocks ? Do n't let no one in this arsenal without permission , ' you said . So I got this idea . Let 's start advertisin ' . Arsenal Rule , and that . It 's like I say  --  it 's a habit . " In the whole time Hood had known him he had never said so much about himself . Murf was silent for a minute , as if wondering about his own candor , discovering embarrassment . Finally , Hood said , " But wo n't people think it 's the football team ? " " Right , " said Murf . " That 's the funny part . " " I get it , " said Hood , but he was glad it was too dark for Murf to see his face . " Like no one knows . You write down Arsenal ' and everyonep211thinks it 's the team . Right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret family , like , and no one has a fucking clue . " He chuckled . " Right on , ' they 're saying , Up Arsenal ' and they do n't even know they 're supporting us . That 's the best part . " He showed I food his shadowy face , his lighted ears , the glint of his earring , then he burped . " They do n't know nothing , the wankers . " Hood said , " Some advertising . " They walked to the upper end of the path and paused for a moment . Nothing moved , and in that enormous tract of shadows there was no sound but the wind tearing at the half-hidden stones and grass . Startled by the silence they turned and headed down the path again , as if seeking to be calmed by the muffled crunching of their own footsteps . Murf said , " I hate this boneyard . " He tramped against the wind , with his small head down and his black coat wrapped around him . He tottered forward , hunched like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing , " Boom widdy-widdy , Boom widdy-widdy , boom-boom . " Hood had not said anything about the night before , but he could see that Murf was glad to have been able to do him the favor . They were friends ; now there was no question of it . Before , he had shown his loyalty in unlikely ways . Hood had stuck by him , defended him against Mayo 's sneers , and to show his thanks Murf had redecorated the bathroom . The little deception over the painting  --  Lady Arrow 's intrusion  --  had secured their friendship . Murf had tagged along behind him for that ; and the fight at the dog track had lifted Mures mood and made him candid . Yet Hood wondered how he had gone from being a boot-boy in Penge to a bomber for the Provos . He had no particular belief ; he had a crude skill . Hood was amazed that Murf had been able to follow him for an entire day without once showing himself . He was small , but not that small . Tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayo said that Murf was to stay behind , but Hood insisted he come and said , " He 's my secret weapon . " Now , Hood said , " You saved my life , squire . "  | " You mean that punk ? " Murf laughed , a little bark in his throat . " I thought you were going to put his lights out . " " He was dead-scared . " Murf laughed again . The laughter carried to the tombstones and was flattened into a mirthless snort that thudded at the far wall . Murf said gruffly , " I would have cut him and all . " " Did you recognize him ? " " No . I thought you knew him . " Murf looked to Hood for a reply , but there was none and Murf went on , " He scared your chick . I felt sorry for her . " They had gone to New Cross together in the train , saying nothing . Lorna sat , sniffing with fright into a hanky she held in her fist . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were alone in the street Lorna said , " Who are you ? " It sent a chill through him , as it had that first day when she had caught him prowling upstairs . Walking her home he tried to explain  --  telling her how he had once quarreled with Rutter , inventing reasons for the pretense of Rutter 's not knowing him . And though she half believed him she was fearful  --  the casual violence was too great a reminder of her old life . She repeated that Hood was no different from Ron : a thug , a villain , dangerous , putting her at risk . At the door she she said , " I never want to see you again . " He did n't care ; he was just playing about , using her . " I 'm not even pretty , " she said . " But I know what you are  --  you 're a fucker , just like the rest of them . " To Murf , kicking at the cemetery path , Hood said , " She was upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed quite nice , " said Murf . " I would n't want to see her messed up . " " She 'll be okay . " " Those punks , " said Murf . " They 're a bad lot . Hey , you would n't believe it , but punks like that are always pestering the Provos . " " What do you mean ? "  | " They got hardware , " said Murf . " They got connections . Like they know Arabs . " And Hood thought of Weech 's two trunks of guns ; it had been a puzzle , but now he saw that he might solve it like an acrostic , adding a dozen names to make a word with their key letters . Murf looked at the cemetery shapes and sucked at the wind and said , " They probably come up here already and left , Sweeney and them . It 's all my fault . " " Do n't worry about it . " Sweeney : another name . He knew nothing , but he was almost relieved to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to see them and commit himself further . Once , when he had acted alone , it had all seemed very simple . His present anxiety was like a fear of crowds , the mob that would sweep him from his own motives . The origin of his doubt was the discovery weeks ago that he had made a passport for that wealthy actress he had taken a dislike to . So they were linked . But there was more : the painting stolen by the rich girl from the titled woman . They were all related ! And what of Weech 's arsenal ? Was it also part of the family now ? He resisted assigning it ownership as he had resisted anything final with Lorna , to preserve some distance and avoid the complicating sympathy of kinship . Yet it was as if by degrees he was waking to the true size of his family and seeing it as so huge and branched it included the enemy . To harm any of them was to harm a part of himself . A family quarrel : if he cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man slipping through the gate at the far end of Paddington Cemetery , the shadow hurrying along the path . What mad cousin was this who had dragged himself from the past to plead with him ? He said , " Heads up , squire . " Murf moved behind him , whispering , " Boom widdy-widdy  --  " The man approached and as he stepped close to them heflipped his cigarette away . It glanced against a tombstone andthe tip came apart , making a shower of sparks , lighting forp214seconds a jar of wilted flowers and the dagger of a cross in the ground . Murf said , " Easter  --  " " Stuff your bloody password  --  what are you doing here , man ? " " He 's with me , " said Hood . " You 're supposed to be alone . " The man turned . " Hop it , Murf . " " Hold the phone , squire . " " They wo n't like it , " said the man . " That 's tough , " said Hood . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " But I ai n't responsible . " They walked out to Lonsdale Road , where Murf stopped briefly to chalk ARSENAL RULE on the cemetery wall . In the cemetery the man had been a threatening voice , a villainous shape . In the street Hood saw him wince ; he was uncertain , with thinning hair , in a battered jacket . The light removed anyij suggestion of threat and showed his laborer 's stoop  --  a careworn limping . He turned to Hood , peering up : small , close-set eyes and a wrinkled nose , a large dented chin and a crooked Irish mouth  --  then he looked away . He skipped slightly , getting ahead of Hood and Murf , and led them down a side street to a pub . Before they entered he said angrily , " I ai n't responsible . " Then he pushed at the door . The pub was full of hollering men , most of them red-faced and standing in wreaths of smoke , gesturing with pints of beer . A juke box played  --  not music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook the windows . Hood was used to strangers ' stares , but here there was an unusual break in the chatter as they crossed the pub ; he sensed attention , a sharpening of suspicion  --  a pause in the darts game , heads turning , low mutters  --  as if they had entered a private club and were intruding on a closely guarded ritual . In a corner of the bar the man said , " Wait here , " then walked away . Murf said , " I think I should split . "  | " Forget it . Let 's hoist a few . " " There ai n't time . " " They can wait . " " It do n't work like that , " said Murf , trying to make Hood understand . " When they say go , you go . It 's like an order . And they do n't want me  --  I can tell . So I think maybe I 'll just hang out . " " I might need you , " said Hood . " What if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-up man . " " Yeah , but they wo n't do that . You 're seeing Sweeney  --  he 's the chief . " " Never trust the top banana , Murf , " said Hood and he bought two pints of beer . The limping man returned five minutes later and seeing them with glasses he said , " Drink up  --  we 're going . " Without waiting he pushed towards the back of the pub . Hood put down his half-full glass . Murf said , " You leaving that ? " and gulped it . Arching his back he seemed to pour it straight into his stomach . Hood thought they were headed for a back room  --  they were in a passageway stacked with beer crates , then squeezing through a narrow darkened hall . The man kicked a door and they were outside . " Hey , sweetheart , you know where you 're going ? " The man muttered . He glared at Murf . He said , " I told you , I ai n't responsible . " Murf said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , smaller than the first and not so crowded . They entered by the back door and the man , who had grown uneasy in his movements  --  he had not stopped muttering and his posture had become more cramped  --  crooked his finger at some stairs . He said , " Up there . First on your left . " On the stairs Hood said , " Just like any other cathouse . " " I never been here before . " Murf quacked the words nervously and looked around at the worn staircase.  |p216Hood  said , " Smile . " " Widdy-widdy . " Hood found the door and knocked . It opened a crack , a man showed his nose and cautious eye , then it swung open and Hood saw the table  --  another man seated at the far end  --  the dim bulb and drawn shades . The room was bare and had the musty smell of a decaying carpet . And it was cold . The men  --  there were only those two  --  wore winter coats , and the younger one at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously . " Sit down , " said the man at the door , shutting it and slipping the bolt . The man at the table smiled . He said , " Welcome . " " Where are we ? " said Hood . " The High Command , " said the younger man . Hood looked around : a dart board , a bottle of whisky , a broken lamp , a saucer full of cigarette butts . He smiled , then he sat down and said , " I hope you do n't have any objection to Murf . " The man at the table did not reply to that . He sat up , and leaning across the table extended his hand . " My name 's Sweeney . I know yours . " Hood shook his hand . It was a strange clasp , without weight , and glancing down Hood saw that the top of Sweeney 's hand was missing and that he held a rounded stump and two small limp fingers , like a monster 's claw . " A little accident , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his sleeve . " This is Finn . How about a drop ? " Finn nodded and put the whisky bottle on the table with four cloudy glasses . He splashed some in each one and handed them out , winking at Murf . Then he touched Hood 's glass with his own and said , " The offensive . " Murf said , " The offensive . " Hood said , " Any ice ? " " No , " said Finn . " My brother Jimmy 's in the States , " said Sweeney . " Boston.  |p217Your  hometown , right ? He 's been there for years . Married an American girl . " Hood said , " That does n't make us cousins , does it ? " " Mayo told me you were temperamental , " said Sweeney amiably . " She told me you had something important to say . I have n't heard it . " Sweeney quietly finished his whisky . He looked about thirty , though he was balding . There was a toughened redness about his face , a raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the sun . His mouth and eyes were gentle , and he spoke slowly in the strangled accent of Ulster . Hood noticed that he held the glass of whisky with his mutilated hand , pinching it awkwardly against his chest and lifting it using his two frail fingers , as if exhibiting the damage . He said , " I thought we might have a little talk . " " Start talking . " Sweeney went at his own speed . " This organization attracts a lot of funny boyos . I mean , unstable people  --  mental cases . " Ile pronounced the word in the Ulster way , muntal . " They belong in hospitals or with kind families , but they come to us and say they want to help . " He smiled . " All they really want to do is plant a bomb somewhere  --  they do n't care why . They 're looking for victims . " He nudged his empty glass . " It 's made us a little suspicious of volunteers . " " What 's that got to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't you ? " Hood said , " I used to think I could help . I gave Mayo a boost with her painting . " " To be sure , " said Sweeney . " But an ordinary drunken layabout from some village in the Republic  --  or even in England  --  it 's usually obvious why he wants to join . He 's a bit lost , running away from his wife or his parents . He feels secure with us  --  we understand that . You 're not in that category . " " How do you know ? " " We know you , " said Sweeney . " We know the importantp218things . Some of the other fellers wanted you over here months ago but I said no . We tried you out on that passport . That was a good job , but I still could n't figure you out . What 's the motive ? What does a feller from a good family  --  Jimmy did a little detective work , you see why does a feller earning a handsome salary in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bomb factory ? " " We were all casualties in Vietnam  --  I was n't the only one , " said Hood softly . " Some died , but even more were born there , and I 'm telling you , we 'll never forget how painful it was . " He thought a moment . " I found out which side I was really on , so I left to fight somewhere else . " Sweeney shrugged . " Everything 's so easy for you Ameri-cans . " " You mean it 's not for you ? " " It is n't . It 's bloody hard . " Sweeney turned to the wall to reflect . He said , " When I was twelve I had to prove myself . I broke every shop window on Feakle Street in Derry  --  hundreds of pounds worth of plate glass . My father was delighted . The Smasher ' he called me . Now you , " he said , pointing at Hood , " you were probably a Boy Scout . " Hood said , " I 've always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just a cheap way of avoiding blame . " " I 'm a responsible feller , " said Sweeney . Hood thumped the table and cried , " You 've got sitting targets ! " " That 's how it looks to an outsider , I suppose . If you knew how we operated you would n't say that . This has been a bad summer . Our supplies dried up . I 'll be frank with you  --  we 've been burned . " " So have I , " said Hood bitterly . " Sorry to hear it . I wish there was something I could do . " " You can tell me why I was n't contacted sooner . " " That bothered you , did it ? Well , it 's just as I say . I wasp219wondering what was in it for you . Mister Hood , you were too eager . " " So you delayed . " " You could say we were waiting for a telephone call . " " But you let me do the passport . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to hear it . " " It 's not very interesting , " said Sweeney dismissively . Hood laughed . " I knew you 'd hedge . " " Did you now ? " " But that 's all right . You do n't have to tell me anything . " He fixed his eyes on Sweeney 's . " I can always ask Miss Nightwing . " Sweeney sighed and looked at the rear of the room where Finn and Murf were sitting in silence . He said , " Murf , how would you like a beer ? " " Widdy , " said Murf , blinking and bobbing forward . " Okay . " " Finn , take our friend downstairs and buy him a beer . I 'll see you later . " " Heads up , squire . " When they were gone and the door was bolted again , Sweeney said , " Let 's talk about Miss Nightwing . " He had become genial , a mood Hood took to be a cover for his suspicion . He smiled again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you ? " " I met her . " " I thought she had more sense than to go yapping about her sordid past , " said Sweeney . " But then I never really understood the girl . It 's like I was telling you . We get a hell of a lot of funny people . I do n't think she 's a nutcase in the usual sense , but she 's certainly unstable . " " She did n't tell me anything , " said Hood . " I just guessed . " " You guessed , did you ? That 's hard to believe . " " I was a consul . Do you think she was the first one to try and pull a fast one on me ? "  | " I forgot you 've had training , " said Sweeney . " It must have upset her . She 's an emotional sort of person . Very interested in the poor and oppressed . She sees them and she cries . That is an admirable thing , but it 's the extent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much better at entertaining the troops . " Sweeney winked broadly . " Ah , she was wonderful at that , she was . A real morale-builder . " " That 's why you gave her a passport , then . " " Not exactly . About five months back , when our American supplies dried up , we needed some contacts on the continent . Our girl Araba claimed to have a lot of helpful friends . Thanks to you we fixed her up with a passport , and off she went . " " With an ass like that she must have made a lot of contacts . " " Who knows ? " " You mean she did n't come up with the goods ? " " She was n't supposed to take delivery , " said Sweeney . " Who was ? " Sweeney waved his mangled hand carelessly . He said , " Agents , agents . " " What are we talking about ? " said Hood . " Arms ? Dynamite ? What ? " Sweeney smiled . " Oh , cabbages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned . " " You 're guessing again . " Sweeney added wearily , " You 've been talking to Araba too much . " Hood said , " I 'm probably wrong , but I would have thought that if Araba made a supply deal for you and it went through , I 'd have seen a little action . The big London offensive . But I have n't seen anything . " He stared at Sweeney . " So I guess she burned you . " " You 're probably wrong . " " I told Mayo you were delaying . She denied it , but now I understand . Araba welshed on you . That 's what you get for trusting the idle rich . " " The rich only have money , " said Sweeney . " But you can see why I was hesitant to take you on . Araba was just anp221actress , but you were a highly paid diplomat . No one had ever heard of you . All we knew was how much money you earned and where your family lived . Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious . So we waited . " " I think you 're lying , " said Hood . " You talk about the offensive , Mayo talks about the offensive . But what 's the offensive ? It 's a couple of teenagers hustling bombs into luggage lockers . Oh , and I almost forgot about Mayo 's painting . That was a brilliant caper  --  it really had the art world up in arms , right ? What an offensive . " " Have you been to Belfast ? " " No , " said Hood , and he muttered , " Do n't mention reli-gion . " " You should go , " said Sweeney . " You 'd learn something . Ever see a father gunned down in front of his wife and kiddies ? " " Yes , I have , " said Hood solemnly . " And what did you do about it ? " " I came here . " " Maybe you can see why we 're militant . " " I do n't call stealing paintings very militant . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throats . " Sweeney looked closely at Hood , then said , " If you have other ideas I 'd like to hear them . " " I 'll write you a letter , " said Hood . " If you 're worried about Araba you can forget it . We expelled her . " " For burning you . " " It 's no concern of yours . The fact is she was expelled . She 's on her own now . " " Competition , " said Hood . Sweeney grinned . " Actors . " " There are a hundred more like her aristocrats , suckers , and middle-class girls with problems . Like Mayo , who takes her bra off and thinks she 's bringing down civilization . She 's just a can of worms . Once , she saw a pretty picture . Then shep222became a revolutionary and decided to steal it . She 's like a lot of them , a barbarian with taste . " " Hold it , " said Sweeney . " Mayo 's my wife . " Hood said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've been told that before , " said Sweeney softly . They faced each other and Hood saw an acknowledgment in Sweeney 's gray eyes , a recognition bordering on the saddest affinity : they had slept with the same woman . Hood did not feel guilty ; he felt ensnared by a sense of shame , and angry that he had been brought so close to this stranger . He thought : What does that make me ? Another member of the family . And he could see now how it had all gone wrong , why Mayo had kept him away or perhaps Sweeney himself , out of pride , had avoided bringing him any further into the plot . He could hardly be expected to welcome his wife 's lover . " Her name is n't Mayo . It 's Sandra . " Hood said , " I do n't have much to do with her these days . " " I know , but it would n't bother me if you did . A man sleeps with your wife . It hurts at first  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's putting up with and you almost pity the poor bastard . " Sweeney laughed and reached for his glass . " I 'm going , " said Hood . Sweeney faced him . He said , " You 're going to help us . You 've got ideas  --  the offensive is yours , if you want it . " " You 're really in a jam , are n't you ? " " It 's up to you . I think we can depend on you . " Sweeney took a sip of his whisky . " I 'm getting used to you . " " That 's your problem , " said Hood . " Sweeney 's a great bloke , " said Murf , in the train back to Deptford . " He was like a father to me , he was . He taught me everything I know . " " Listen , Murf , most fathers do n't teach their kids to make bombs . "  | " then they 're useless , ai n't they ? ' Cause that 's what it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seat . " They done my old man . Did n't give him a chance . He 's Irish , so they nobble hint . " Hood looked over and just before Murf turned away he saw the boy 's face crease with grief : he had started to cry . Hood thought : But what have I taught him ? He was going to comfort him  --  they were alone in the compartment  --  he was moved by the boy 's size , his small crushed face , the ridiculous earring , and that black raincoat he wore in imitation of his own . Then he saw the handle of Murf 's knife and he held back . Suddenly , as if remembering , Murf sprang from his seat , whipped out the kit-tipped pen and wrote on the compartment mirror , ARSENALRULE . At Deptford Station Hood said , " I 'll see you later . " " The pubs are shut , " said Murf . " I 'm not going to a pub . " He left Murf and walked up a side street to Lorna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched a crumpled sheet of newspaper dragged by the wind from the gutter to the sidewalk . It rasped against the garden wall , altering its shape , then tumbled into a tree and flapped fiercely . Hood waited a moment , studying the caught thing animated by the wind , and he was about to go when he glanced up and saw the kitchen light burning . He rang the bell and the light went off . There was no sound from the house . He knocked , then poked open the letter slot and called Lorna 's name . She did n't answer . He drew out Weech 's key and unlocked the door . " Lorna ? " He switched on the light and saw her cowering halfway down the hall , preparing to run upstairs . He almost recoiled at the sight of her , and she seemed not to recognize him  --  she registered slow fear , the negligent despair of someone wounded or doomed . And she was wounded . Her face was bruised , her blouse torn , and there were scratches on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and took her in his arms . He could feel her frailty , her heart pumping against his chest . " What happened ? " " They was here  --  oh , God , I thought they got you too . " She sobbed and then said , " I did n't tell them anything ! " " Love , love , " said Hood , and heard the child cry out in an upper room.  |p225THE  FACE WAS A SUCCESS : even the dog barked at her , and McGravy was taken in for a few bewildered seconds . She had spent the morning at the mirror working on her eyes  --  it was too easy to wear sunglasses , and down there sunglasses in this dreary weather would attract as much attention as a full frontal . The headscarf and plastic boots were her greatest concession , since her first thought was to go as a man . She knew she could bring it off , but how to explain it ? A woman , then , but anonymous . The skin had to have a pale crepy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and premature aging , with dull green mascara on the lids . It took her an hour to get the right crude stripe . She labored with care for the effect and finally achieved it in exasperation , realizing afterward that what she wanted most in her make-up that day was a look of hurry . A woman went out in the morning to shop , but no matter how rushed she was she did her eyes . She aimed , with a few lurid strokes of eyeliner , at the haste and pretty fatigue of the housewife . Instead of lipstick she practiced her bite , clamping her jaw a fraction off-center to convey , in a slightly crooked grin , that her teeth did n't quite fit . Then she put on her hoots and scarf and an old coat , and seeing her , Poldy had yapped in his cowardly dance of aggression , diving at her and swiveling his hind end sideways until he sniffed her and whimpered into silence . McGravy said , " Do n't tell me . Let me guess  --  " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the trunk for the right handbag and selecting one in imitation leather with a broken buckle.  | " Of course , you 're taking the bus  --  Mother Courage does n't take taxis . " " I 'm not Mother Courage , " she said . " I 'm invisible . " " Poldy does n't think so . " But the dog had stopped barking . He was circling her cautiously , sniffing at her boots . " And I 'm not taking the bus , " she said , fixing her bite and crushing the handbag under her arm . " I 'm walking . " She slipped out the back door and hurried down Blackheath Hill to where it dipped at the lights . Then she was only following signs and the map she 'd memorized . She had never walked here , and it was odd , for once she plunged down fromBlackheath , walking west to Deptford , the light altered filtered by a haze of smoke it became glaucous and it wascolder and noisy and the air seemed to contain flying solids . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being invisible cheered her . She celebrated the feeling . There had been a time , before her political conversion , when the thought of going unrecognized would have depressed and angered her . Then , she required to be seen  --  not for herself , a compliment to her fame , but because she believed from the moment she had become an actress that the role and the person playing it were inseparable . An actress did not become another person in studying a part : the part slumbered in her , the character not only Alison and Cicely , but Juliet and Cleopatra  --  was a layer in her personality like a stripe in a cake . Once she had been asked , after a hugely successful sixties revival of the Osborne play she had taken on tour , how she had done the part so well . She replied , " But I am Alison . " She was Paulina , Lady Macbeth , Blanche DuBois , and all of Ibsen 's heroines . They were aspects of herself , but more than that their words too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant improvisation ; she gave language life , she reinvented a playwrighteach time she performed . There was nothing she hated more than the proprietorial way a writer or director regarded the text  --  they wanted to reduce actors to dummies and conceived the theater as a glorified puppet show ( it was thisp227notion , and more , that made her want to ban Punch and Judy shows  --  her first political gesture ) . Acting was liberation . The theater had shown her what possibilities people had  --  it was her political education . Everyone acted , but the choice of roles was always limited by social class , so the laborer never knew how he could play a union leader . True freedom , the triumph of political struggle , was this chance for people to choose any role . It was more than a romantic metaphor  --  she knew it was a fact . That old man , Mister Punch , leaving The Red Lion at the far end of Deptford Bridge , did not know how easily he had been cheated ; in a fairer world he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no great actors , there were only free men . And unseen , part of the thin crowd , she was free today , stamping in her old coat and faded scarf in the High Road , biting to make her face unfamiliar . This was political proof , not simple deceit , but evidence that the woman she was this gray afternoon was unalterable in a capitalist system . Freer , the woman she mimicked would be a heroine . The mimicry was easily mastered , and though once she had needed attention , now , the very absence of it encouraged her . She could be anyone ; she was no one ; she could walk through walls . Deptford  --  especially those angular cranes and chimneys , the low narrow brick houses , the windowless warehouses  --  reminded her of Rotterdam . She remembered the errand as one of her most demanding roles , though she savored it with a trace of regret : it had been robbed of completion . In the end it had failed , and yet nothing she had ever done had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It was all excitement , the smoky jangling train to Harwich , the Channel crossing that night in early summer , and then the brief electric train past the allotments on the canal to the neat station in that cheerless port . Passing through British immigration , looking the officer squarely in the eye , handing over the American passport  --  all of it was an achievement greater than her Stratford season . And there was that odd business with her cabin in the Koninginp228Juliana : she had been assigned a four-berth cabin but she had counted on privacy and had seen the rucksacks and stuffed bags of the other travelers and panicked . She hated the thought of being forced to sleep on this little shelf in a cupboard with three others . She had demanded a single cabin . " For your sole use , " the purser had said , handing her a new coupon in grudging annoyance and suspicion , believing her to be preparinga corner for a pickup . But she had gone back and sat up the whole night in the four-berth cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trotsky , and in the end she never used the expensive single cabin except to wash her face and check her disguise . She saw how the preposterous expense of the two cabins had shown her in safety how she only needed one ; and she laughed at the money it was costing her to learn poverty . Then there was Greenstain  --  only an Arab would misspell his own alias  --  with large pale eyes and a fish 's lips , who had met her in the warehouse and touched her as he spoke , as if tracing out the words on her arm . His staring made him seem cross-eyed , and his lemon-shaped face , unnaturally smooth , frightened her . He had the infuriating manner that dull leering men occasionally practiced on her  --  repeating what she had said and giving it a salacious twang . " What have you got for me ? " she said , and Greenstain wet his lips and replied , " What have you got for me ? " Then she said , " Show me , " and he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal in a stupid courtship . He had spit in the corners of his mouth and would n't stop touching her arm . She was afraid , he was scaring her intentionally , and it was much worse than deceiving the immigration officers  --  even the friendly Dutch ones with their ropes of silver braid  --  because she was alone with Greenstain in that empty warehouse . He was pretending to be sly and he made her understand , using his pale eyes and greedy mouth , that he could kill her and take the money he knew she was carrying . At last , he led her to a corner of the warehouse and showed her the trunks . He kicked one open and took out a gunp229and pointed it at her and cackled , working his jaws like a barracuda . She paid  --  the first of the proceeds from Tea for Three . Greenstain counted the money , then examined each note , making her wait while he checked the bundle for forgeries . He gave her an absurd handwritten receipt with the name of the London agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canal lapped against the quayside . Greenstain belched , then embracedher , and she looked up and in panic memorized a word painted on the warehouse , MaatschappJ , and wondered how it was pronounced . Greenstain ran his hands down her body and then jumped away . For a moment she thought he might shout . She saw him nod ; he broke into gagging laughter . " A girl ! " he cried . " You are a girl ! " He pushed her lightly . Uninterested sexually , he became almost kind , and later on the way back to The Hook of Holland he pointed out the wartime bunkers and , in a settlement of houses , a still solitary windmill . Theater : Rotterdam , the deal with Greenstain , the male disguise . Then , months later , it all went disastrously wrong  --  no trunks , no arms , excuses from the agent , and silence . Sweeney said , " You boobed . " Nothing was delivered and she was expelled for the failure . She was disappointed , but she had felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American had said , " Let me guess your passport number . " She saw how dangerously near she was to being exposed . All the effort , all the lies and then  --  but she believed it was another lie designed to scare her off  --  she heard that Weech , the London agent with the trunks , had been killed . The November darkness enclosed Deptford ; she was anyone in the twilight , trudging home . Ahead , halfway down the crescent , she saw the house . She snapped open her handbag and checked her face in the little mirror ; she fixed her bite ; she walked to the gate and nudged it open with her knee . Hello , more decay  --  the place was a shambles . Judging by the decrepit houses he had seen from the top deck of the Numberp230One bus , it was already happening . He got off : the street stank . Perhaps it originated here , the crack that had started the slump , and was eating its way to the city , shriveling everything in its path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very bricks look friable , and where was all that smoke coming from ? It raked his eyes and made a fog of the twilight , so dense the weak light made everything small and gave the limpers on the street wraithlike , almost ghostly proportions . He was fascinated by it . It was as if he were seeing the first evidence of the coming quake , the proof that he had been right all along . And how subtle it was ! He had always thought it would be a terrible crash , thunder and lightning , screams , people holding their heads , and great steaming pits appearing all over London ; buildings becoming dust and the city slipping sideways . A tremendous seizure , striking at the foundations and buckling the whole anthill from its sewers to its ramparts . Food disappearing from the shops and small children chewing their chinstraps , and ragged Londoners crowding the streets in panic , breaking his windows on Volta Road and howling at him . Confusion ! No : that was fancy 's need for theater , the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this , it was this  --  smoke , silence , emptiness and slow decay , an imperceptible leaching that was a strong smell long before it was a calamity . The knotting of the city 's innards into dead hanks , not combustion , but blockage , the slowest cruelest death . And if he had not known in advance that it was going to happen he might have missed it , like an eclipse of the sun on a cloudy day . He might have thought a cup final had emptied the streets , and asfor the aroma of ruin that someone had left the lid off hisoverflowing dustbin or allowed his dog to foul the footpath , nothing more . But he knew the stink and smoke was calamitous , and he felt as he made his way along the Deptford backstreets like an explorer who , having made his shockingdiscovery in the strange place , looks for confirmation andp231realizes that he is the sole witness : he will not be believed . It was an intensification of a feeling he 'd had often this year , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying , who saw its bricks crazing , its fate ( as he had just read ) written in blood on the station wall , ARSENAL RULE  --  he understood the warning . The message was everywhere , but it was ignored . He alone saw it and bore it as if it were a sorrowful secret , like the memory of his dead child . They were smiling in the High Road , in the lights from the fish-and-chip shop , beefy laborers turned to wraiths in fog that was smoke , and banging carelessly into public houses . They did n't know ; ignorance was part of the disease , because the illness would kill them before they understood it was fatal . He adjusted his bowler hat and swung his briefcase into his free hand , treading an unvarying track , as ' if at the edge of a precipice . He would be late for his tea , and Norah might be upset . But the fellow did n't answer his phone and did n't reply to letters  --  very naughty  --  and how else was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curious address , and he got a further shock when he saw it in the ragged yellow lamplight , for it was how Volta Road would look when the disaster crept farther south . He looked up the road into the future . She had entered by the back door with Brodie 's key , and finding no one at home , had gone upstairs to look at her painting . She sat and studied it with gluttonous interest , more than she had ever summoned at home , where most of her father 's collection was stacked against the wall . She had never guessed how valuable the Rogier self-portrait was until it wasstolen the newspapers had given it an extraordinary price . Alovely piece , but awfully cluttered a very busy painting  --  and yet the face , the posture , the hands , the bones beneath that flesh : superb . She thought : But I would have stolen a Watteau ; and then : Self-portraits always show wounded men and brokenp232promises , not living men but dying men , the poor artist with his nose against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . The theft had made a greater claim on her imagination than possession had ever done . And she liked the secrecy of this visit , prowling to the top floor and closing the curtains in the house at the margin of the city  --  a hide-out . It seemed to her as if she were the thief , the knowledgeable accomplice ; and this was her prize . Risking her reputation , her great name , she had stolen the painting . She smiled at the wounded Fleming and felt great satisfaction , the sense of being an outlaw . And she toyed with the thought that she was resident here . This was her hidden house , her room , her loot . Here she was safe with all her secrets . The painting shimmered from the closet . She tapped a spot of snuff onto the back of her hand . She raised it to inhale and the doorbell rang . Parting the curtains and peering down she saw a shadowy visitor , a woman , plainly dressed in an old coat and gazing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up her nose . Again , the bell . But it was her house , her painting . On the way downstairs she thought of moving in , finding a room for Mrs. Pount and having stationery printed . She opened the door , delighted to be given a chance to test her ownership . " Yes ? " She saw the woman falter . " What is it ? " " Jumble , " said the woman . " I 'm collecting for the church sale . It 's on Saturday . " " Come in . I 'm sure we have something for you . " Lady Arrow led her through the parlor and down the hall to the kitchen , saying , " I think it 's such a splendid idea to have jumble sales . Share things out  --  so many people throw away perfectly lovely toast racks and napkin rings . I know my friends go all over London in search of good jumble . Here , have a seat . I 'll beaver around upstairs . " " Them tea towels would do me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Lady Arrow . She directed the woman back to the parlor and hurried upstairs to a bedroom , the one just off the landing . The bed , a mattress on the floor , was a tangle of sheets and blankets , and there were children 's posters on the wall . She pulled out a drawer : rags . In the bottom drawer she found an assortment of alarm clocks and lengths of wire . She selected a clock and was on her way downstairs when the doorbell rang again . " I say , will you see who that is ? " she called , and she thought : What a farce  --  what a lark ! She would move here , Mrs. Pount would get used to it . She heard the woman 's footsteps , the door opening , the greetings . She listened on the landing . " Yes , can I help you ? " It was the woman 's voice , and for a long moment there was no reply . Then a man 's voice sounded , polite astonishment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had traveled up the stairwell to her . " Excuse me , is that you , Miss Nightwing ? " " Mister Gawber . " The clock in Lady Arrow 's hand started to tick . She threw it hard against the wall and descended the stairs , swearing under her breath . She found Mr. Gawber and Araba in the parlor . They looked up when she entered , and masking his surprise with a smile , Mr. Gawber stood and gave a jaunty salute . Araba had removed her head scarf and changed her bite ; but she said nothing . Lady Arrow thought the actress looked very gloomy and embarrassed . Finally , Araba said , " Let 's apologize and say nothing more . I hate explanations . " " Let 's talk about Peter Pan , " said Lady Arrow . " Yes , " said Mr. Gawber . " I must say , we 're all looking forward to it . Norah 's terribly keen . " " I 'll send you tickets , " said Araba . " Tea ? " said Lady Arrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My tea will be waiting at home , " said Mr. Gawber . " I wo n't keep you , " said Lady Arrow.  |p234At  the door Araba said , " I 've got just the part for you , Susannah . " " Super , " said Lady Arrow . " Now you know where to find me . " She shut the door triumphantly , waited ten more minutes , and went back to Hill Street.  |p235SHE  HAD SAID  --  painfully and barely moving her swollen lips  --  " I do n't want to talk about it now , " and he kissed her again . Pity or love , it did n't matter ; he saw her wounded and he was aroused , almost passionate . He touched her , felt for her breasts . She sucked air and her ribs lifted his hand . She was hysterical  --  she screamed ; then she was the opposite , numbed and speechless . Her fright trembled away , and when he put her to bed she fell asleep at once . It was the child , Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped off in Hood 's arms . He put him in the cot and went into the other room to lie beside her . Anger kept him awake ; he blamed himself for her bruises and claw marks and he was disturbed by the fear that he could kill them for it  --  find the bastards and beat them to a pulp . She had been beaten . He expected her to rebel , but she had no particular anger . She was forlorn , alone ; the assault saddened her , like a reminder she was trapped  --  as if she 'd broken her head against her own cage . She did n't cry  --  she was n't even frightened . The violence that would have terrified another woman only weighted her with bruises and made her frail , brightened her eyes with fever ; and lying next to her  --  it surprised him again  --  he felt her nakedness heating him , her body hot from her wounds . Now , sleeping , she was a small injured girl ; but she burned against him , denying him rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three he knew he must roll a pill or stay awake cursing . He felt for his pouch and rolled the opium pill in the dark , then went to the bathroom for a glass of water to wash it down . Standing there in front of the sink he saw his reflection in the mirror and in hisp236eyes those narrow crescents of yellow on the whites , the malarial stain , a mark of Hue . He swallowed the pill and closed his eyes and he was gliding from an inlet on the Perfume River , a rudder stick crooked under his arm , and in the bow of the sampan a Vietnamese girl knelt , the moon shining on her tight flank , her black mane of hair swaying as she worked with the small flame . Then she tossed her hair and smiled and passed him the pipe . It was a perfect memory : his mind had simplified the past , selected from it , and prettied it by making it whole . Twenty nights on the river had become one . Yet he could not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly error or failure , and though the man in the boat had his name , it was another man , one he had grown to mistrust . So memory itself , that inaccurate glimpse of the past , he avoided or tried to suppress : he hated its futility . He shut his eyes and saw the future . His mind plunged ahead in time , the landscape altered , his own figure dwindled . The future , always the future  --  why else would one fight ? Memory was retreat . He rehearsed what was in store for him  --  not a matter of days or a month , but years and more , decades , and then he saw the same solitary man , slightly hunched , whitehaired , in fading clothes , treading the dust in some tropical place , making his way in dazzling sunlight . It was what he wished to see . He closed his eyes and saw this old man who had cut himself off and chosen to end his life here , in the simplest way ; a man with no country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family and who , at that distance , had fallen silent and ceased to act . A calm fugitive : he ridiculed the notion of exile  --  in this world there was no exile for an American . Hood 's reflections were not memory but this modest vision he hoped was prophecy  --  as all truth was prophetic  --  and though at first he felt it was the effect of his drugs ( the narcotic flash , the sight of himself in the future walking up and down in Asia ) , the process became habit . He was older , in a palmy place as dense as Guatemala , never speaking ; but the road wasp237always the same , the foliage a deep green , and the blurred figures ignored him and passed by , water carriers , naked children , slow bulls . To live abroad was to create a mythology about yourself , more than a new personality  --  a liberating fantasy you could believe in , a new world . He could only live in a country where he was willing to die , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this strangely lighted city , on this watery island . He did not want to be known or mourned ; he wished only to act and then vanish , to choose his own grave site . And it troubled him to think that the single reason he was in bed with this woman was that he had killed her husband . But who was that ? Who killed him ? The murderer was a man he scarcely knew . In the morning Lorna was groggy . Rather than wake her he gave the child breakfast and took him to school . " Are you my daddy now ? " asked Jason , taking Hood 's hand at the end of the road . The faithless child , he thought ; he would go with anyone . But Hood could n't blame him ; the child 's safety lay in this deceit perhaps he saw it as the only way of crossing the road . Hood said , " Do you want me to be ? " " No . " And after a while he added , " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's hand , saying nothing . " He 'll duff you up when he comes back . My daddy 's a good fighter . " Crossing the road , Jason tightened his grip , and he did not release it on the other side . Somehow he knew the terrifying fact without knowing any of the words . At the school gate a group of mothers stood chatting in an oblong of sunshine . They dropped their voices when Hood approached , and he could see them avoiding meeting his eyes . They were young , several were pretty , and they looked as if they were dressed for more than a trip to the school . Jason yelled and ran to join his friends . Hood noticed how his presence had subdued the group , made the women self/conscious , awkward , with a kind of pedestrian envy and suspicion . Hood said sharply , " Hi , sweetheart ! " They looked away . The teacher came out , an older woman in a smock , fussing with a toy , waving the mothers aside and calling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had gone some distance down the road when he turned and saw them all , staring at him . He knew what they were saying : a new member of the family , her lover or more likely , the fucker . He got back to the house to find her up , and now he saw the disorder he had missed the night before  --  an ashtray tipped over , a smashed lamp , a buckled chair leg , and the carpet littered with glass shards and cigarette butts . Lorna was feebly sweeping the hallway . " Have you seen upstairs ? " she said . " I told them I did n't have the key , so they broke down the door of the spare room , where the stuff was . That 's what did it  --  they saw it was empty . Willy starts screaming at me . The other one  --  I do n't know his name  --  he done his nut . He slaps me . " " I 'll kill them for this , " said Hood through his teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want trouble . " She sighed and said bitterly , " I thought when Ron copped it I was free . No more fights , no more worrying about the police . I can live , I thought . Then this . The fuckers . " " Were they looking for guns ? " " What guns ? They asked about you . They got really ugly  --  who are you ? What do you do ? Who do you work for ? That kind of thing . " " And you did n't tell them anything ? " He was almost incredulous , but he believed , and he was ashamed . " Nothing , " she said ; she smiled at the memory of it . " Because I knew they were just trying it on , testing me like . I mean , the fuckers know you , so why are they asking all these questions ? Play dumb  --  that 's what Ron used to say  --  pretend like you do n't even speak English . " She winced and picked up the broom , and beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut no ice . One of them grabs me  --  twisting me arm  --  and the other one starts slapping me . And Willy , he 's just standing there whistling out the window . " " They 'll be sorry . " Hood paced the room . " I do n't know why I did n't come out with it and tell them you had all that stuff . " " Why did n't you ? " " Because I knew what they 'd do . You think I 'm stupid ? I 'm used to this . Me , they 'd only slap me around I was n't afraid , I was n't even mad . That 's the way they are  --  and they do n't kill women . " She stared at him . " But they would have killed you . " " So you saved my life , " said Hood . " But later , after they left , I thought they might have got you . I was frantic , and I almost cried when I saw you last night . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 'll be back . " " Not if I nail them first , " he said . " They 're probably looking for you now , " she said . " Just leave me out of it . They 're the worst fuckers  --  they 're murderers . " " I 've ruined your life , " he said , and he wanted her to believe it , to take his word for it without asking him how . She came over to him and touched his face . " No , " she said . " You 're good . You made me happy . I do n't even know you , but I almost love you . " She held him and said , " Sometimes I think everything you say is a lie . I do n't care about that . If you have to lie to make me happy , go ahead tell me lies . I don'twant to know the truth if it 's just going to spoil everything . " He was moved by her complete surrender ; she knew nothing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , joined by a corpse : a dead man 's family . But the pity had been refined ; she might not know him , but he knew her , and he feared that it would go further , to the narrowing sympathy that would deny him his future . She had been lost . He had found her , but now he saw he could only save her by sacrificingp240himself ; that love was all loss , an early death . Yet he could not help what he had felt when he saw her so badly beaten  --  passion , or blunter still , a kind of lust at seeing her so wounded . Even now , holding her , feeling her frailty , he was heated , and he wanted to hurry her upstairs and make love to her . She said , " I do n't care what you do to those fuckers . But do n't leave me  --  please . " " Do n't say please . " " Last night you called me love , " she said . " Say it again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie . " " I want you to lie ! " He kissed her lightly , but as he started to speak , the doorbell rang . " It 's them , " she said , and tore herself away , her eyes flashing in fear . " Go upstairs , " he said . " I 'll see to them . " He got a knife from the kitchen , but on his way to the door he threw it down in disgust . It clattered on the floor and was still spinning as he dragged the door open . He sighed anddropped his arms . " Yeah , sorry to bother you , " said Murf , who was tugging at his earring with one hand and pushing at his other ear . He was nervous ; the quack was in his voice . He tried to laugh . " I hope you was n't on the job . " " Come in . " " The thing is , she 's back , " he said , stepping in and smoothing his ears with both hands . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture balding men usually made with their hair , the pushing and smoothing . " The old girl  --  that filthy great giant , Brodie 's mate . I was having a kip , see , and I heard her come in . I gets behind the door and she sneaks around , like . I did n't know what to do , so I come over here . You want me to put the wind up ? " " Where 's Mayo ? " " Out with Brodie . Either in Kilburn or maybe shopping . I do n't know . They took the van . "  | " Maybe the offensive , " said Hood , smiling . " Not a chance , " said Murf . " Like Mayo told me straight . You 're going to do it now , the English offensive  --  you 're the guv . " He grinned and widened his eyes and said , " Yeah , arsenal rule ! " " So the secret 's out . " " That 's why I got worried . The old girl might find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Murf , remember those guys that jumped me at the dog track ? " " The villains . Shorty and them . " " Who are they ? " " Never seen them before . " " But you can find out . They 're agents  --  fences . " " Arfa might know . " Go ask him , " said Hood . " The guy 's name is Willy Rutter . There are some others , but Rutter 's the one I want . He must live around here . I want to catch him at home . " " I 'll smash on Arfa 's door , " said Murf . " But what about the old girl ? " He guffawed and showed his teeth . " Maybe she wants me to raise her . " " Forget it . Find out about Rutter . " When Murf had gone , Hood went upstairs and told Lorna who it was . Lorna lay on the bed , stiffly crouched , hugging her stomach ; but hearing there was no danger , she stretched and relaxed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of the bed and pushed her hair out of her eyes . " Tell me a lie . " " Okay , " he said . " I love you . " " Tell the truth , " she said impatiently , getting up on one elbow . He said , " I do n't love you . " She fell back . He thought she was pouting until he realized her lips were swollen that way from a slap . She said , " I do n't care if you do n't love me . Anyway , everyone says it , so it 's justp242another lie . I know you like me , or else why would you stick with me ? " She smiled slowly . " And I know something else . " " What is it ? " He knew an instant of panic . She said , " You 're not a fucker . " " But all men are fuckers that 's what you said . " " Not you . " She drew him down , hugging him and moving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cheeks grow wet , his eyes sting , but it was her tears trickling into his eyes . She was crying softly , and though she tried to control it he could hear the groan in her throat and feel the convulsion ; she was sobbing . " Do n't leave me , " she said and held his arms tightly- so tight he felt his wrists tingle and go numb . The girl in her wept , but a woman 's strength held him . " Please do n't leave me  --  please , please , please ! " He thought : Yes , but there is something to do . He was crowded , haunted by the men who had wounded her . The punishment he planned lingered in his mind that remained , an intrusion between their bodies as obvious as her wounds . The thought prevented him from responding to her plea , but he saw an end to it . He would get them and be finished  --  discard everything , abandon the house on Albacore Crescent , and begin with her . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hope . Ridding her life of those bastards would rid him of that part of his own past that now seemed a moment of uncontrolled fury , when murdering her husband he had murdered the worst in himself . He embraced her and kissed her and she sobbed , but he felt nothing except an impulse to find Rutter and hammer him . Kill that lurking rival . She was still pleading , but her mouth was against his neck and he heard nothing . " We ca n't stay here , " he said at last . " Murf 's coming back . " Murf arrived an hour later with Arfa Muncie . Seeing Lorna'sbruises , Murf said , " Hey , who done you ? " Then he changedthe subject , perhaps suspecting that Hood might have beatenher . Muncie looked alarmed ; he was silent and eyed Hoodcarefully as if waiting for a signal to run . But Hood saw howp243rattled Muncie was ( he was picking up Lorna 's china dolls and examining their seals , and testing the firmness of chairs : the junk dealer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his ease , slapped him on the back Muncie jumped  --  and said casually , " Now where does our friend live ? " " I can show you , " said Muncie . " I mean , out the window . " " So he 's that close ? " " No , Millwall . But you can see it from here , " said Muncie , and he explained to Lorna , " See , I know these here houses . I do a lot of clearing . I never cleared this one as such , but blimey , some of the old boys around here got some great stuff for me shop . Victoriana like . Frames and that . Mirrors . Leaded windows . I flog them in the West End . That fireplace , " he went on , hurrying across the room and rapping his knuckles on it in approval . " Do n't look like much but you could dismantle it easy . I 'd give you a good price and hump it up to the King 's Road . Up there this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quid 's worth of grotty glassware . " Lorna shrugged and said , " You 're welcome to it . Take the whole fucking lot . " " I could give you a estimate , " said Muncie uneasily . He spoke to Hood . " I do valuations . " " The great Arfa . He 's a thief , " said Murf , pronouncing it feef , " but he knows his way around . Eh , Arfa ? " " Yeah . Can we go upstairs ? I 'll show you the place . " Hood said to Lorna , " Do you know where Rutter lives now ? " " No , " she said . " All I have is the fucker 's phone number . " " Stay here , honey . We 'll be right down . " She said , " It 's time to pick up Jason . Maybe I 'll see you . " They climbed the stairs and trooped down the hall to the back room . The broken door sagged on its hinges . Murf said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think you can flog it , Arfa ? It 's a antique . Heh-heh . " Muncie ignored him . He shuffled to the north window and pointed , saying , " He 's over there . " Through the river haze that hung beyond the funnels of thep244power station and the cranes , and gave the distant buildings the look of thunderclouds in an old etching , receding into browner air and finally a gray emptiness any London view was like a view from an island : it might have been the sea way out there , it was so flat and featureless  --  were more cranes , the towers of a housing estate , slate rooftops , and one squat black churchsteeple . The heavy layer of air pressed the low skyline and made it look as if it had just collapsed and was smoldering . Hood followed Muncie 's finger , from island to island , but that was a ruined island , dead under its own stifling dust , and all the visible brickwork was dark , reddened by dampness and age . Apart from the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seize ; and watching , Hood had the illusion of it slipping from focus , sailing away , becoming mist . " Millwall , " said Muncie , tapping the glass . " It looks like an island , " said Hood . " It is an island , " said Murf . " Isle of Dogs . I would n't live there for anything . " " That 's where Rutter lives , " said Muncie . " I could tell you where his boozer is , but you do n't want to go there . The Swan , up Limehouse . " " Diabolical , " said Murf . " Does Rutter know you ? " said Hood . Muncie pulled his sleeve across his nose . " No , " he said . He blinked . " He might have heard of me . " " The great Arfa , " said Murf , grinning . " But he knows Murf , " said Hood . " So Murf was telling me , " said Muncie . " He was going to slip him a blade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stuck him and all , " said Murf , with a show of bravado . " I could have . A real spill . Right in the chops . " He danced across the room pretending to hold a knife against an invisible throat . " Widdy-widdy boom ! " he said , thrusting with his hand . " So long , Willy-baby . " " Sure , " said Hood . " Look , Muncie , I want you to be ouradvance man . "  |p245Muncie  glanced nervously at Murf . " I do n't want to get involved . " Murf made a face . " Anyway , I 'm tied up . " " The great Arfa , " said Murf . " How would you like him to lean on you ? " Muncie whined . " Widdy boom ! " said Murf , flailing his arms , making thestabbing gesture again . He laughed in Muncie 's face . " You do n't have to get involved , " said Hood quietly . " What do I do then ? " " Just find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Show us the house . That 's all . We 'll do the rest . " " It 's simple  --  suss it out , " said Murf . " After we take care of the geezer you can go clear out his house . Do n't have to do no estimates . Get some nice stuff . Chairs and shit . Eh , Arfa ? " Murf elbowed him companionably , rocking him sideways , but Muncie 's expression remained solemn . He came to rest , upright again , and frowned with worry . " He 's tough is Rutter , " said Arfa , pronouncing it Ruh-uh . " He 's killed blokes and all . " " Like who ? " said Murf , mocking . " Huh , Arfa ? " Hood said , " Anyone we know ? " Muncie 's eyes widened and he pointed to the floor . " Yeah , " he said in a whisper . " Downstairs . Her old man ! "  |p246SHADOW  AND MIST MINGLED to make night in the late afternoon . Hood had said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not long in coming that November day . They took a bus to Greenwich , and out the side window Hood saw the haze thicken by the minute , the dense air brimming in the streets and rising up the flat-fronted houses . Walking to the tunnel entrance  --  a Victorian brick dome propped at the edge of the embankment  --  Hood looked across the river . There were not even shadows in Millwall , only a few twinkling lights and one feeble beacon . Here , some trees were fretting by the riverside , but over there  --  offshore  --  it was as if the island he had seen earlier had sunk and now , where it had been , stray boats were making distress signals . No church , no cranes , no buildings , not even mist ; and though the river shimmered with snakes of light it too was empty . " In here , " said Muncie , and led them past the clanking elevator cage and down the circular stairwell to the tunnel under the Thames . It was the sort of glazed endless corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of echoing tiles , without doors or windows , stretching away , and ringing with the footsteps of people he could not see . Voices chimed fromthe walls and his own footsteps gulped . Murf stopped once to write MILLWALL WANK  --  ARSENAL RULE . On the far side of the river they emerged from the stairwell and its stink of urine and chalk to a dark muddy garden and amaze of earthworks . Muncie hurried into the road , to Rutter 's ; Hood and Murf sat on a bench in the little park . Greenwich , banked with lights , lay across the water , the Royal Naval College rising from the walkway to trees and the turrets of thep247Observatory , a symmetry of floodlit stone with its lovely proportions reflected intact in the water , crusted with a blaze of lights . To the right were the masts and spars of the Cutty Sark , simulating dead trees , and farther over the blacker precincts of Deptford  --  more islands . Hood pointed to the Naval College , which the odd light and the falling mist gilded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Beautyful , " said Murf . " Go like anything . " For a moment , Hood thought Murf was agreeing . Then he saw how the building lighted the smile of excitement on Murf 's face  --  an eagerness to destroy : Murf was imagining blowing it up . Without saying why , Hood began telling Murf about Verloc , as he had once told Lorna how the ponderous man in the overcoat had tried to blow up the Observatory , how he had blown his young brother-in-law to bits . And as he told it he reflected that the incident had no complexity : the men had the minds of children ; and the child Stevie , who was wise , was inarticulate , ineffectual . It was a simple tale , a shadowy outrage , a bout of madness . It started , it squawked , it was gone ; a story of self-destruction . Murf listened , and Hood could see the Naval College exploding on his eyes . He tugged his earring and said , " Provo ? " " Verloc ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucked it up . " Murf sang , keeping the tune in his nose . " Arfa 's taking his time . " He laughed . " He 's scared , he is . Thinks he 's going to get rompered . " Murf sang again , stamping when he said boom , then said , " Yeah , I should have stuck the geezer and all . " " Look , " said Hood . A low black boat was going past , almost without a sound . It plowed the water , a creeping shadow with lanterns on its bulkheads , and behind it a laden barge , like a snooping whale . There was a look of funereal stealth about it , and the small voice that carried from the hidden deck muttered , emphasizing the immensity of water . It passed out of sight and then waves began beating the river wall like an eruption of surf.  |p248The  backwash made the reflections of the Greenwich lights dance in eddies , like wind through fire , feeding the blaze and making separate flames leap all over the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " A crackle , like sticks of dry kindling coming alight . Murf bowed his head to listen , but the sound was familiar to Hood . It was rain , sweeping from the Greenwich side of the river , crackling towards them , making the surface flames small and numerous . They heard it clearly before it descended on them a moment later , like the tropical rain that had surrounded Hood with this simulation of burning  --  a murmur from Vietnam , pattering on leaves before it drenched him , a few warning drops , then a downpour . " We 'll have to sit it out , " said Hood , " or Muncie wo n't find us . " We 'll get soaked . " Murf stood up , as if to avoid it , and walking up and down the narrow promenade next to the iron guardrail he beat his hands on his streaming coat and shouted into the storm , " Hey Arfa ! Let 's go , mate  --  stop wanking ! " Now Greenwich and all its lights were filtered through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank began to recede , losing its contours ; the storm wrenched the land away by blending it with the night sky , and it diffused the lights sothey matched their spangled reflections in the river . Filfy wevva , Murf was saying , as he returned to the bench and put his collar up . The two crouched there , like wet roosting ci ows in their black coats , watching the river 's changing dazzle , saying nothing more . For Hood , the time moved with the pace of the rain , slowly as it dripped and more quickly when the wind sprang up and blew it harder into his face . And it seemed to him as if his life was not made of action , but an absence of it , this waiting at a river 's edge in rain that stopped him and moved the river . Raising his voice against the wind , Murf said , " But I 'm glad it 's you . " " What do you mean ? "  | " This fucking offensive . You 're the guv'nor now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He screamed impatiently , " Arfa ! " Hood said , " I 'm the guv'nor all right . " Murf turned his dripping face to Hood 's and with hoarse enthusiasm said , " Give it to ' em , son . " " One villain at a time , " said Hood . He heard a muffled cry and splashing feet and saw Muncie running clumsily from the far end of the park . " There he is . " " The wanker , " said Murf . He stood up and danced in the downpour . " Hey , Arfa ! " Muncie was out of breath , his hair was plastered flat to the top of his head and hung in strings at his ears . He gasped and wiped his face on his sleeve , then said , " I seen him go in . But he 's a crafty bastard . He parks his motor up the road and sneaks in by the back way . The house was dark before he come , so he must be alone . " " He does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ai n't traveling , is he ? " said Muncie , backing away slightly as if expecting Hood to hit him for contradicting him . " Good thinking , " said Murf . He laughed loudly . " The great Arfa . " " Let 's go , " said Hood . They crossed the small park and entered the road , walking east , past the abandoned earthworks and a high wooden fence marked with Millwall slogans and swaying in the storm . The old church looked only blacker in its windy corner . Up another road , past more temporary fences ; but nothing showed above the fences  --  here there were no buildings , and the streetlights illuminated only the broken cobbles of the road and the holes filling with rainwater . It looked like the newest ruin , knocked sideways and devastated , and not a soul to be seen : a glimpse of the end . A bus lumbered past , lighted but empty , and pitching in the uneven road . It appeared from the darkness at one turning and entered the darkness beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran along the eastern margin of Millwall , andp250then they saw  --  on a side street and set back  --  a terrace row of four bow-fronted houses . Somehow , these houses had been spared the destruction that was obvious around them . They stood alone on the derelict road , another island of damp eroded walls in a flat sea of rubble . " The one with the light , " said Muncie . He hunched and indicated the house , concealing his pointing finger with the flap of his jacket , as if afraid of being seen . " Right , " he said . " Cheers . " " Where you going , Arfa ? " " Out of this filthy rain . " " You 're already wet , you silly bastard . " But Muncie was running , stamping in the puddles . He vanished behind a fence , fleeing in the direction of Greenwich . " The great Arfa . " " Wait here , " said Hood . " I 'm doing this alone . " " Let me come wif you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes in after me , you thump him . " " Take this . " Murf jerked the knife out of his sheath andhanded it to Hood . " Stick the bugger . Like I should have . " Hood slipped the knife into his pocket and walked towards the house , feeling safely hidden by the driving rain . He detoured around the lighted front window and ducked down the side entrance to the rear of the house . He climbed a wobbly fence and found himself in a dark back garden , at the bottom of which was a high wall . A ladder in the weeds tripped him , and he paused and heard a boat 's thudding hoot and the water 's splash , and he smelled the oily air ; the river lay just behind the wall , and now  --  his eyes growing accustomed to the dark  --  he saw a steel door in the bricks . The entrance was wide enough to take crates from a boat moored on the other side , Rutter 's own quay . He walked over to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look through the window . Locked and black ; but he would n't kick the door down , he did n't want to give Rutterp251time to respond . He made his way to the front of the house . Ring the bell and wade in , he thought ; give him the chance he 'd given Lorna . He waited , fingering Murf 's knife . The light burned in the front window , but the curtains were drawn . Holding himself against the house he sidled to the window , and easing himself near he peered through a slit in the curtains . He sipped air and looked again . In a chair drawn up to an electric fire , and still in his raincoat , was Sweeney . The man sat clutching a drink against his chest with his mutilated hand . He frowned and sat up , finished his drink , then stared into the empty glass . Bastard , thought Hood . He trembled and fought an urge to break in and kill him . Sweeney ! But another thought cautioned him , and he slipped away. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying on the way back , in the echoing footway tunnel under the river . " Bloody Arfa , " said Murf . He kicked the tunnel floor . " But who was it ? " " Do n't ask me , " said Hood angrily , his voice ringing on the wall . " I do n't know these creeps . " " You should have stuck him , just for the hell of it , " said Murf . He saw Hood 's rage and seemed anxious to calm him . " I want to get the right man , " said Hood . " Maybe it was the geezer you seen . " " Maybe , " said Hood . " There 's plenty of time . " " But where 's Rutter ? " Hood said , " That 's the funny part . He 's probably out looking for me . " " Eyes front , " said Murf . " It 's Bill . " A policeman in a helmet and gleaming rain cape was coming towards them , wheeling his bicycle through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Murf , and grinned , showing the scowling policeman the stained pegs of his teeth.  |p252THE  HOUSE ON ALBACORE CRESCENT was lighted ; its plumpstove-shaped front , with the windows ' brightness sloping across the leafless hedge , had never looked safer or more snug , and the glow on the curtain folds gave it a stove 's warm flicker . In the rising curve of the road those bright ledges attracted him ; then the instant moved and he remembered he lived there . All the rest of London drifted on the shallow swell of night , hidden places that were only inaccessible-sounding names , like Elmer 's End and the Isle of Dogs ; but the house was secure , and the enlarging light gave it a cheerful fortified look in the darkened road . He had just left Lorna 's with Murf . After his night and day there , in the locked house where she sat like a child baffled by the pain of a nightmare ; and after that glimpse of Sweeney at Rutter 's in the bare room of dead air set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was astonished to return to his own house , which he had convinced himself was another uncertain island , and find Mayo in an apron cutting vegetables for a stew and Brodie lying in front of the television set  --  home ! It was a cozy picture composed of safety and warmth , the stewpot bubbling on the stove , the television 's blue hum , the gas fire 's simmering . He had not noticed before how they were protected , and though he could see Lorna 's from his upper window her house was an island as shadowy as Millwall , where she crouched , a castaway with her own wreckage . The last thing she had said to him was , " Now I 'm going to give thefuckers their money back . " He could n't help her that way anymore . Upstairs , the man in the painting stared , and in another room the small arsenal was stacked ; but these werep253props for another play . Downstairs , a more ordinary drama met his eye . He came in with Murf , and entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It 's only us ! " Murf looked around and said , " Now , where 's me slippers and me pipe . " Murf kicked off his wet shoes and sat on the sofa with his legs outstretched . He squinted at the television and tapping his stash began making a joint . " Where you been ? " Brodie rolled sideways and screwed up her face for the reply . " Hanging out . " Murf lit the cigarette and inhaled . He passed it to her . " Anything on ? " " Nah . " She puffed and winced at the smoke . Hood was at the doorway , smiling at the little scene : Murf slumped in the chair , sucking at the joint , Brodie on the floor with her chin in her hands , her thin jersey riding up her bony back . It was a zone of complete calm , warmed by the sizzle and smell of the frying meat from the kitchen . Murf and Brodie 's postures gave it a look of slatternly innocence . " Have a seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've got to talk to Mayo . " Murf swallowed smoke . He gulped as if stifling a belch , then waved the cigarette at Hood and said , " Hit ? " " Give it to her , " said Hood . He peered at Brodie . " Okay , angel ? How 's your tattoo ? " Brodie said , " You know what you can do . " " Shut up , " said Murf , digesting more smoke . " He 's just trying to be matey . " Hood left them quarreling . In the kitchen , Mayo said , " I hope you have n't eaten already . I 'm making something special . " She worked at the counter , cutting carrots and potatoes , and as she spoke she reached over and shook the frying pan of meat cubes . Hood saw Murf pass the kitchen door , headed for the stairs . " Irish stew , " said Mayo . " I make it with beer . " Hood said , " How did you know I 'd be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took a letter from her apron pocket and handed it to him . " I knew you 'd be back to collect it . It came this afternoon  --  express . Looks like money . " " You should know . " He glanced at it  --  the return address was indecipherable ( but a London postmark : another from Mr. Gawber ? ) and stuffed it into his pocket without opening it . He continued to watch Mayo slicing the carrots into discs . The knife was new and there were more , all sizes , in a rack over the counter . He said , " A new set of knives . " " Cutlery , " she said , and he wondered if she was correcting him . " The old ones were getting dull . " " What a cozy place , " he said . Mayo grunted and added the meat to the simmering broth . The kitchen door burst open . Murf came in , laughing crossly , high and angry at the same time , and swinging an alarm clock in his fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me clocks ? " " What is it , squire ? " said Hood , putting a hand on his shoulder to quiet him . " Me clocks , " said Murf . " I always leave them a certain way , like . But someone 's been messing around  --  me drawer 's open , like it 's been fucked about . There 's one on the floor , just flung there , and look at this one I found on the stairs . She 's bust . " Hood took it . The glass was broken , the hands twisted . He rattled it and handed it back to Murf . " Too bad , squire . " " But who done it , that 's what I want to know . " Murf was panting . He spoke to Mayo . " Was it you ? " She laughed and swiped with her vegetable knife . " I expect it was Brodie . " " Brodie keeps her hands off me hardware . " " An intruder , " said Hood , keeping a grip on Murf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He probably forgot where he left it , " said Mayo . " Admit it , Murf  --  you pig it up there . " " I ai n't lying ! " cried Murf . He stepped near to her and shook the clock in her face , making the bell rattle.  | " Do n't you shout at me , " said Mayo , sternly , her voice dropping into a tone of command . " I 've been cooking since six o'clock while the rest of you have had a little holiday . You 'll want to eat it , too , but a lot of help I get ! So do n't come around screaming at me . " She had been holding the knife at Murf . She turned and whacked at the vegetables , making the cutting board jump . " Go away  --  I 'm busy . " Murf 's face was pained . He said , " I ai n't lying , but she 's laughing at me . " " What 's all the noise ? " Brodie hung at the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Murf , " and I expect I know who it was that fucked with me clocks . Your mate , the hairy giant . " " So what ? " " So what , she says . " The clock rattled in Murf 's hand . Mayo said to Brodie , " Was someone here ? " " Maybe the lady I told you about , " said Brodie casually . " Impossible . How would she get in ? " " I gave her a key . " Hood folded his arms and whistled through his teeth . Seeing hostility in Mayo 's face , and the others ' attention onher , Brodie came awake . " Hey , she got a right to be here . Hey , that 's her picture upstairs , ai n't it ? Hey  --  " " I stole that picture , " said Mayo , with an owner 's scream of petulance , as if the picture were being claimed by a stranger . " But it do n't belong to you , " said Brodie . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So you gave that old bull a key ? " " She bought it off me , " said Brodie . " Anyway , she 's okay . " " She 's okay , " said Murf , shaking the broken clock at Brodie . " That 's why she fucked with me clocks , right ? " " I ca n't cook with you in my way , " Mayo said . " You 're murder , " said Hood in disgust , and without another word he went into the parlor . He itemized what he owned there , the Chinese objects , the carvings , the silver . Upstairs , he looked through the closets , assessing his belongings , his suit , hisp256stack of clothes , his consular briefcase with the blank passports and the official seal , his Burmese box of drugs . There was little more to do ; there was nothing else he owned . He did not look at the painting : he coveted it too much . He went into the spare room , where the televisions were , the appliances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two locked trunks with the Dutch words lettered on them . He sat on one and considered opening it , taking a pistol and keeping it . But no  --  they wanted them all . They 'd get them . He sat for a long time on the arsenal , smelling the stew , hearing the clank of Mayo in the kitchen and Brodie and Murf braying at the television . It was not disorder , it was the routine of any noisy family , an ordinary racket . This was a home , a family arsenal ; safety was like remoteness , disturbance was elsewhere . He took the letter out and tore it open . You Are Invited to a Peter Pan Party . He read down the printed sheet , and at the bottom , in a large vain hand was scrawled , Hope you can make it . A. N. And holding the invitation and hearing the clatter downstairs he was reproached again by his safety and pitied Lorna the more . He could stay or go  --  it did n't matter . By accident , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle . He deserved to fail . It 's up to you , Sweeney had said . Yes , at last ; but every delay had saved him , as if inaction itself was , like the surest assault , a celebration of security . At the center of it all , in an attitude of reflection that was indistinguishable from an attitude of pain , was a mother and child . He was stirred by fear at the thought of them , for he had acted once and only now saw the truth of it  --  to act was to fail . Mayo called up the stairs : dinner was ready . She conveyed it in a tone of irritation , and he heard her nagging Brodie and Murf to set the table . He went down and took his place . Brodie banged the soup bowls on the table , Murf poured beer ; Mayo carried the stew in a tureen and with a housewife 's disgusted pride , grumpy satisfaction mingled with resentment , ladled it into the bowls . Hood got up and turned off the television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Murf said ,  | " Watch your gob . " She reacted obstinately , trying to float the round end of her spoon in the stew . Mayo said , " Stop playing with your food ! " There was no more talk ; the gas fire sputtered in the wires of the white-hot grate . Hood said , " We 're leaving , " and before anyone could respond he added , " That 's right  --  we 're all clearing out . " He ate , the others watched him , and the only sound was from the shelf , where Murf 's clock had begun to tick . Finally , Mayo said , " You 're crazy . " " I 'm in charge , " he said , and went on eating . " You do n't know what you 're doing , " said Mayo . " He 's the guv , " said Murf . " What about all that stuff upstairs  --  those televisions , that junk ? " Hood said , " We 'll leave those for the next tenant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put her spoon down and made a sour face . " So look around , " said Hood . " Find anything you consider valuable , anything with writing on it  --  anything that can be traced to us  --  and put it in the van . All the rest we 'll leave . " " What a dumb idea , " said Brodie . " Hey , where are we supposed to go ? " " No problem , " said Hood . " You can go to Lady Arrow 's . " " The hairy giant , " said Murf . " She 'll eat you for breakfast , sister . " " What about me ? " said Mayo . " Back to your husband , Sandra . " Hood was going to say more , but Mayo blushed and stared at her hands . " I 'm sticking wif you , " said Murf . " What about Muncie ? " asked Hood . " The great Arfa , " he said . " I 'm wif you . " " Okay , " said Hood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mayo faced Hood , her eyes meeting his and then faltering . Hood said , " I 'll think of something . " Brodie looked around the table , and at the walls , the floor ,  |p258the  ceiling . She said , " We 're not going to be here anymore . " " It 's a nice place , " said Murf . " You do n't get hassled . You can hang out here . " Brodie shook her head . " It 's kind of sad . " " I do n't feel hungry , " said Murf . " I made that especially for you , " said Mayo , sitting up and raising her voice , " and you 're going to eat it . " " Let 's not have an argument on our last night , " said Hood . He picked up his glass of beer and winking at Murf he said , " This is it , then . The beginning . " " Look at him , " said Brodie . She scraped her chair back and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms flapping , and then Mayo said , " You 're on your own now . I do n't trust you . " " Then start packing , " said Hood . " You 're going home . " But she refused to pack . She followed him around the house , sulking , and then complaining as he collected his artifacts from the parlor . Upstairs , he filled his suitcase , lining it quickly with his clothes , and she stood next to him , accusingly , not making any move to pack . Hood said nothing . She stamped the floor angrily , as if she were being left behind ; and she threatened him , but her anger was pathetic , proof of her helplessness . Because she could not do anything more she raged ; she was like a wife at the moment of a divorce she had demanded as a rash threat , seeing her mistake and knowing she is lost  --  too late , too late . She kept her wronged face at him . He ignored her . " Go to hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise , punching the pillow and switching off the lights and screaming when he turned them on again . He knew she wanted a scene , something final to seal it , and he had felt  --  with his back to her  --  that she wanted to hit him . Now , deprived of argument , she lay in the bed with her head under the blanket . He saw her clearly , as he once had when she had spoken of the painting : a child who was used to getting her own way , as if being a clever daughter was an incurable condition for whichp259the only consolation was the fatherly praise of an attentive lover . Brodie and Murf were on the stairs , in the back room , calling to each other , banging and slamming . " Do n't cry , " he heard Murf saying ; Brodie whimpered ; Murf 's coaxing turned to blame  --  he swore and shouted , " Shut up ! " " Tell them to stop making so much noise , " Mayo sobbed . She burrowed deeper into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were murmurs from their room , Murf insisting and from Brodie an odd pained cry . Then a muffled kicking and the small strangled howls of the two children making love . It ended with a series of brief despairing thumps , and lying there in that large house Hood believed it was the saddest sound he had ever heard . The next he knew it was morning , he was being shaken . Mayo stood over him , all teeth and hair , pulling his shoulder and saying , " It 's gone  --  the picture 's gone ! " Across the room his suitcase lay open , the clothes were strewn ; his briefcase was unzipped  --  disorder where he had left a neat pile of his belongings . " Who did that ? " he said slowly . " I did , " said Mayo . " Well , if you did n't take it , who did ? " He got out of bed cursing , righted the suitcase and rearrangedthe clothes . Then he went to the cupboard and saw the empty space where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow were carved in his stomach . He had been robbed , and on his eye a dim after-image of the loss . Feeling very tired , he sat down on the edge of the bed and put his head in his hands . He said , " When did you see it last ? " " I do n't know . " He loathed her for saying that . " It must have been Brodie 's friend , " he said . " She was here yesterday . And it 's hers . " " The bitch , " said Mayo . She was packing now . She pushed clothes into her suitcase . He was glad she would n't have the painting , but sorry top260think that he might never see the self-portrait again . He tried to picture it , but his imagination simplified it , and all he saw was a nearly expressionless face , a gesture , obscurely lit ; already it was gone . He knew he would have to see it for it to speak to him . And it was odd , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most severe . His spirit had been thieved and in its place was fatigue . He was assailed by another feeling  --  unexpected  --  an enormous sense of himself , his own smell and weakness , an absence of light ; a brown reminder of mortality . The theft was like a death , and his feeling  --  that shabby weight of flesh , that futile sigh that did not even have anger 's strength  --  was close to grief . " I knew it , " said Mayo , with her scream of petulance . " As soon as my back is turned  --  " " Dry up , " said Hood , not looking at her . She grumbled and finished packing . She had several suitcases , a large cardboard box , and in three tea chests the dishes , the pots and pans . He had always wondered who the kitchenwarebelonged to  --  who owned the towels , the sheets , the blankets ? They were in her luggage : all the furnishings were hers . The house was stripped ; the furniture that was left looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seemed empty from the moment he saw the painting was missing . Brodie came downstairs carrying a shopping bag of her belongings and a guitar he had never seen her play . Murf followed with more of Brodie 's things and he and Hood began to load the van . Entering the house for more of Mayo 's boxes he heard her shouting in the kitchen : I 'm the one who has to answer for it , not you ! And Brodie 's whine : I could n't help it . Anyway , it 's hers , ai n't it ? It 's not yours . When they came out , breathless from the quarrel , Mayo still blustering and Brodie sheepishly dragging her feet , Hood said , " Off you go then , Sandra . " " I do n't even know where I 'm going , " said Brodie . " I 'm going to get anorexia again , for shit sake . "  |p261Mayo  took the keys from her handbag . She started for the van , then stopped and walked back to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , slap him , shout . She was beyond caring about risk . But she said in a controlled voice , " Last night you said this is the beginning . Well , you 're wrong  --  this is the end , but you 're just too cowardly and selfish to admit it . " " Do n't you believe that , " said Hood . Murf had run to the bottom of the crescent . Hood saw him running back , holding a paper bag . He handed it to Brodie : toffees . Brodie started to cry . " It 's no big deal that you 're handling this offensive , " Mayo was saying . " There 's no war here . It 's happening in Ulster . If you had any guts you 'd go there . " " I 'm counting on you to do that . " " I 'm staying in London , " she said . " Then you 'll be hearing from me , " said Hood . " But one last thing  --  do n't come back here . Stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll never be happy , " and started the engine . They sat side by side , not speaking , mother and daughter , a pair of enemies . The van jerked forward , then disappeared at the turning of the crescent . Murf said , " Now what do we do ? " " We make the house burglarproof . " " Yeah , " said Murf . " Good idea . If you can find the locks . " Hood said , " You 've got the lock , squire . " " Yeah . " Murf smiled . " Nah . I ai n't got a clue . " Hood said , " We 're leaving a bomb behind . " " Yeah . " " A trip wire , " said Murf . Now they were in the spare room , standing among the stacks of crates and televisions , the two large metal trunks . " Maybe use that wall socket there for juice . Beautyful . Go like anything . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
