ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE <P> by ROBERT M.PIRSIG 412 pages . Morrow . $7.95 . <P> <P> Like the pool hall and the tattoo parlor , the motorcycle usually gets a bad press . T.E . Lawrence ( of Arabia ) terminated his romance with himself aboard a British army bike , which he had named George VII . During the ' 50s and ' 60s , Hell 's Angels on their Harley-Davidsons turned in convincing performances as Visigoths at the gates of suburbia . Easy Rider could not keep off the grass , and Evel Knievel , that star spangled Icarus of the carnival circuit , gives young minibike owners potentially lethal delusions of grandeur . But now , during the lull in the great gas panic of ' 74 , comes a 46-year-old Minnesotan and writer of computer manuals , who makes the motorcycle not only respectable but also a focus of mental and spiritual health . <P> Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance has some casual relationship to Eugen Herrigel 's small , graceful classic , Zen in the Art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving parts , and though it is clearly autobiographical , much of it reads like a novel . It is also a roadbook in the greasing-of-America tradition and a philosophical thriller that probes with dizzying ambition the cloven values of technological society . What makes all this unique is Pirsig 's way of welding his parts to a most down-to-earth story about a troubled man and his eleven-year-old son on a cross-country motorcycle trip . <P> Mental Breakdown . Pirsig is no orthodox Zen Buddhist ; his equivalent of a meditative tea ceremony is tuning his engine . " A study of the art of motorcycle maintenance , " he says , " is really a miniature study of the art of rationality itself . " In an age preoccupied with sensation , Pirsig does not regard " reason " as a dirty word . His persistent message is that thinking is feeling , a view that underlies his advice about how to prepare mentally for troubleshooting an engine . Briefly , motor maintenance requires a good deal of quiet concentration so that the underlying principles of the engine are allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the subject ( mechanic ) . A Zen monk would say that under such conditions , the fixer and the fixed are no longer opposing objects but one reality . The author is more practical . Among other things , he suggests that if you can not fix the bike yourself , at least avoid garages where the mechanics play the radio . <P> It is the alienating gap between subject and object that Pirsig attempts to fill . To do so he alternates philosophical discourses with descriptions of what happened on a trip that he took out West in 1968 , his son Chris riding on the back of the cycle . By the time they reach Bozeman , Mont. , where Pirsig once taught college English , it is apparent that his ideas have been earned at considerable cost and suffering . He reveals some frightening facts about himself . In 1961 he suffered a mental breakdown and underwent a series of shock treatments , which wiped out many of his personal memories . To give his philosophical inquiries a dramatic edge , Pirsig refers to his shadowy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socrates ' straight men from Plato 's Dialogues . <P>
