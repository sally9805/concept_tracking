When a worker falls ill or is injured , many large employers pay disability benefits without a murmur . The pregnant employee , however , generally gets no money for time taken as maternity leave . In a potentially far-reaching decision , Federal Judge Robert Merhige has found General Electric Co. guilty of sex discrimination in denying such benefits to pregnant workers . Ruling on a suit filed in 1972 by GE women , the judge dismissed the company 's argument that pregnancy is incurred " voluntarily . " Said he : " This standard is not applied in informal sports injuries , most of which could also be avoided by appropriate preparation and circumspect precaution . " <P> The company plans to appeal the verdict ; the final outcome is expected to influence similar suits . Moreover , collective bargaining agreements made by other companies in the past two years contain disability-pay clauses contingent on the outcome of the GE decision . If it should favor women , group insurance rates for employers nationwide would be increased considerably . <P> Of all employers , who is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong candidate is the professional woman who hires a maid to care for her household while she is out building a career . So concluded Doris B. McLaughlin , a labor expert at the University of Michigan , who surveyed domestics working for 50 professional women in Ann Arbor and found that the employers were apt to deny their household help benefits they themselves take for granted . Less than 5% of the employers provide paid holidays and a scant 11% grant paid sick leave . Regular , automatic raises are given by only 17% of the employers and only 53% of the professional women paid into the social security fund . <P> Viewing the results , McLaughlin declared that the movement of one group of women up the economic ladder leads to the economic exploitation of another group . Says she of the professional women : " Probably their own freedom is so new that they do not yet think of themselves as employers-a role that until recently was thought to be almost exclusively reserved for men . " <P> Few countries are as obsessed with machismo as Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can not even open a checking account without her husband 's permission . <P> In this climate of chauvinism , it is all the more unusual to find a successful bank devoted to , and run exclusively by women . Founded a year ago in Madrid , the Banco de la Mujer ( the Woman 's Bank ) has already opened five provincial branches . <P> While it boasts as clients almost every female professional group in Spain , the bankers are especially eager to reach what Director Piedad Garcia de la Rasilla , 28 , calls " the ordinary woman . " In a male-run bank , says De la Rasilla , " she tends to be treated like a child showing offa collection of marbles . " To better educate women about finance , the bank supplements its regular services with counseling on conjugal property laws and investing in stocks .
