Neil Sedaka : Sedaka 's Back ( Rocket ) . As an early ' 60s teen-age idol of prom crowds in strapless formals and ducktail haircuts , Sedaka wrote more than 75 top ten hits . Then the Beatles squeezed out shooby-dooby , and Sedaka slipped into obscurity . In his first U.S. album in twelve years , he retains his cozy , cheerful style ; yet his songs dig deeper . Laughter in the Rain is already a hit , and Solitaire and Standing on the Inside have high musical polish . <P> Arthur , Hurley &; Gottlieb : Sun light Shinin ' ( A &M).; This is the second album of a trio whose voices ring strong and bright against vivid instrumentation . Lead Vocalist Jeff Arthur , a Florida orange-juice tenor , wrote all or part of six cuts , including the ten der ballad That 's the Time I Miss You Most of All . A blowsy sweet country rocker , Tubin ' , shows skillful commercial production . <P> Linda Ronstadt : Heart Like a Wheel ( Capitol ) .

Besides Ronstadt 's supersmash single You ' re No Good , cuts include the title song by the talented Anna McGarrigle , and Paul Anka 's It Doesn ' t Matter Anymore . <P> Bob Dylan : Blood on the Tracks ( Columbia ) . Inconsistency remains the chief characteristic of recent Dylan albums . <P> After a while prolific artists cannibalize their own work : You ' re a Big Girl Now is a lesser Just Like a Woman . From a working poet , a line like " They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn " is a dismal cliche . <P> There are irresistible moments , however , like Lily , Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts - a narrative gem about girls , guys , gambling and jealous love . Over all , longtime fans will approve of Dylan 's return to an older , sparser folk style . <P> Phoebe Snow ( Shelter ) . " Sometimes these hands get so clumsy that I drop things and people laugh . Sometimes these hands seem so graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fantasy blend nicely in this graceful , never clumsy debut album . Phoebe 's original lyrics are as plain as morning bread , but her alto voice is jazzy . Jazz Notables Teddy Wil son ( piano ) and Zoot Sims ( saxophone ) join the diversified goings on . <P> Henry Gross : Plug Me Into Some thing ( A &M).; An alumnus of the Sha Na Nas , Gross gathers a few of his friends including Terry Cashman , Tom my West and even his pet Irish setter for a high-voltage round of rural rock . <P> Never mind the occasional barks . The infectious beat of Dixie Spider Man and some fancy guitar acrobatics on The Driver 's Engine - an electrified country breakdown - are well worth plugging into . <P> <P> J.D.
