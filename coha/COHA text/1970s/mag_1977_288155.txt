The little guy wins the big one <P> The negotiating teams worked until 5:30 one morning last week to make final changes in the agreement . Only five hours later , as Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau stood by smiling , President Carter announced that Canada and the U.S. had decided to build a trans-Canadian pipeline that will carry natural gas from Alaska 's North Slope to the Lower 48-and later may also funnel gas south from Canada 's partly developed deposits in the Mackenzie Bay delta . <P> The swiftness of the final negotiations was surprising , since the U.S. and Canada have engaged in considerable bargaining about the project . More unusual , a relatively small and unknown company beat out the giants of the North American gas industry to win the contract to build and operate the pipeline . The construction cost alone could reach $14 billion . The victor is Northwest Energy Co. , a firm based in Salt Lake City , which had sales last year of $626 million , mostly from a pipeline system supplying seven states . Its peppery chairman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle . For his bested competitors , including the Canadian subsidiaries of Gulf , Exxon and Shell , McMillian had no sympathy : " If they had been more sensitive to what was going on , we would n't have had a chance . " <P> When competition for building the pipeline first began in the late 1960s , leading Canadian and U.S. firms , among them Pacific Gas and Electric and Texas Eastern Corp. , banded together in what seemed like an unbeatable consortium called the Arctic Gas Pipeline Project . The group , which at its height included 27 companies , proposed to construct a 48-in. line . It would begin at the Alaskan field of Prudhoe Bay ( proven reserves of 26 trillion cu . ft. , enough to supply current U.S. needs for more than a year ) and follow the northern coastline to Canada 's Mackenzie Bay deposits before heading south to carry the gas to the U.S. <P> Washington established ten task forces to examine the pipeline applications , and Ottawa set up three special committees . The hearings were exhaustive , especially those conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine the pipeline 's ecological and social impact . After interviewing 300 environmental and economic experts and 1,000 natives in the region , Berger ruled last May that the consortium 's line was unacceptable because it would endanger the habitat of many species of wildlife . Canada 's Natural Energy Board backed Berger , thus killing the Arctic project . <P> That left two outfits in the running . The first was the El Paso Co. , one of the nation 's largest gas transmission firms ( 1976 sales : $1.4 billion ) . It advocated an " all-American " solution : building a gas pipeline alongside the existing Alaskan oil pipeline to the port of Valdez , where the gas would be liquefied and shipped in special tankers to California .
