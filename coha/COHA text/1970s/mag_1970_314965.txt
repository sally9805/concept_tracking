OCTOBER FERRY TO GABRIOLA by Malcolm Lowry . Edited by Margerie Lowry . 320 pages . World . $6.95 . <P> October Ferry to Gabriola , like Malcolm Lowry 's generously praised Under the Volcano , is a romantic , convoluted prose journey in quest of an easeful death . It is not a completed novel , however . According to Margerie Lowry , the author 's widow , this published version is her " sorting out " of numerous drafts of chapters , paragraphs and even sentences that Lowry began to write in 1946 . It started with his notes on a trip to the islands off British Columbia . These became a short story . Then the story grew first into a novella and finally into an amorphous novel full of Lowry 's preoccupations with alcohol , mythologems , cabalistic gewgaws and theosophist arcana . In 1957 , two months before he died after a bout of heavy drinking , Lowry was still struggling to tame the surge of words and images . <P> What emerges from Mrs. Lowry 's arrangement is the story of Ethan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law when a man he had successfully defended proved to be guilty of a horrible crime . Unfortunately , Lowry never got around to filling in the details of this crucial episode in Llewelyn 's life . An assortment of character sketches and plot shards adhere to a rather slack narrative line that draws Llewelyn and his wife Jacqueline through a portentous search for a new home . <P> By the time they near their goal-Gabriola , an island on Canada 's West Coast - they have been transformed into a pair of unearthly representatives of a pagan diaspora . And not too subtly . The fire and water that drove them from their previous homes are invested with stage magic . Old men mutter about the qualities of wood as if spirits lived in the grain . Llewelyn feels foreshadowings in everything from snatches of movie dialogue to highway billboards . Symbols wash up out of the sea and appear in the air . <P> To Llewelyn , who somehow equates his abuse of alcohol with a magician 's misuse of his powers , Gabriola beckons like a nondenominational land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for both heaven and hell-a nice quiet place with no scheduled activities . <P> It is not entirely fair to hold Lowry responsible for a novel he neither completed nor published . It is unlikely , though , that given more time and health he would have been able to curb his compulsion for occulturation or tailored his ambition to fit his talents . He was a comr pulsive perfectionist , gifted with the vision to perceive paradise but unable to get his eyes off his own private hells . At his best , Lowry was sporadically brilliant , but reading him is too often like watching a man who has exceeded his capacity try to get home without stepping on the cracks in the sidewalk . R.Z.
