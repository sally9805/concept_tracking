When Princeton Physicist Gerard K. O'Neill made the proposal that space colonies be established to relieve the earth 's overcrowding , increasing pollution and energy shortages , many of his more skeptical colleagues dismissed the scheme as one more exercise in scientific fantasy . But , unlike many other far-out proposals , the idea has not faded into oblivion . <P> For almost a year , O'Neill has continued to expand his vision with imaginative new details . He has become so convincing an advocate that this month , at a three-day conference in Princeton , 100 scientists , engineers , international lawyers and social scientists agreed that space colonization is not only possible but eminently feasible . They even discussed such basic questions as what kind of meat the colonists will eat ( the conferees were told that rabbits , chickens and pigs would be easier to raise in space than cattle ) and what types of legal and social structures might be set up in their extraterrestrial world . <P> Huge Cylinders . This summer two dozen specialists , including O'Neill , will convene for ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Calif. , to study the practical problems of getting the enormous project into orbit . Meanwhile , O'Neill , 48 , is energetically continuing to press the idea in sci entific articles , television and radio talks , and in campus lectures at the rate of at least two a week . Says he : " The whole thing is exploding so fast that I am beginning to worry about how to make time for my work in physics . " <P> As it was first spelled out ( TIME , June 3 ) , O'Neill 's scheme called for assembling in space large aluminum cylinders that would house self-contained communities . The cylinders would be built at the constantly moving " libration points , " where the gravity of the earth and of the moon cancel each other out . Permanently in orbit at those positions , each pair of huge cylinders ( 1,100 yds. long and 220 yds. in diameter ) would support 10,000 people ; they would contain an atmosphere like earth 's , water , farm land and a variety of flora and fauna . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , buildings and soil " down " on the inner surfaces . For power , the space colonizers would rely on ever-present sunlight , captured by large external mirrors that could be controlled to create the effect of night and day and even of seasonal change . <P> At the Princeton gathering , O'Neill and others discussed the establishment of the first colony at a libration point called L5 , which lies in the moon 's orbit at a spot equidistant from earth and moon . Simultaneously , the space colonizers would set up a small mining base on the moon . Its purpose : to provide most of the building blocks for the colonies . Rich in aluminum , titanium , iron and other essential materials-including oxygen-lunar rocks could be fired off by a continuously catapulting device . Slowing as they climb out of the moon 's gravity , these building blocks would eventually arrive at the construction site in free space . That would be much cheaper than carrying the materials from earth , where mineral-rich ores are already scarce and stronger gravity makes it necessary to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
