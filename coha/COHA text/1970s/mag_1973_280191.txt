Ulstermen in record numbers flocked to the polls last Wednesday for Northern Ireland 's first provincial election in four years . Their impressive turnout-about 70% of the eligible voters-cheered moderates in the strife-torn province . That so many people participated in the balloting for local district councilmen suggested that Ulster might be taking a first step toward rational discourse rather than sectarian violence . <P> Not so . When the results trickled in at week 's end , it was clear that the voters had returned to the traditional patterns of Orange and Green politics . <P> The Protestant-dominated Unionist Party , led by former Prime Minister Brian Faulkner , swept the Protestant vote . Most Catholics supported the Social , Democratic and Labor Party ( S.D.L.P. ) . Most disappointing , the moderate and non-sectarian Alliance Party finished a poor fourth , trailing even candidates of the Protestant extremists . Noted the Belfast Telegraph : " The people have spoken and their terms are uncompromising . " <P> In themselves , last week 's elections were not very important . With the British government assuming rule over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councils have little to do besides consumer protection and sanitation . More significant will be the voting for the 78 members of Ulster 's new provincial Assembly on June 28 and the later formation of a new executive body - both prescribed by Britain 's recent White Paper ( TIME , April 2 ) . <P> For all their sectarianism , the Unionists and the S.D.L.P. do support the White Paper . Moderates now look to the Assembly election for the first real ray of hope that Ulster may choose the ballot box rather than the bomb . <P> South of the border , the overwhelmingly Catholic populace of the Republic of Ireland demonstrated , in a remarkably peaceful election , that politics need not be sectarian . For only the second time in the Republic 's history , Irish voters elected a Protestant to the largely ceremonial office of President . He is London-born Erskine Childers , 67 , a former Cabinet member , son of Robert Erskine Childers , an Englishman who involved himself in the Irish struggle for independence and paid for it with a martyr 's death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fianna Fail , which lost control of the government three months ago , defeated Thomas O'Higgins , the candidate of the governing Fine Gael and Labor coalition , by a vote of 636,162 to 587,577 . When he starts his seven-year term later this month , Childers will succeed Eamon de Valera , 91 , who has dominated Irish public life for half a century .
