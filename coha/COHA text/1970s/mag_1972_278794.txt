SUMMER travelers abroad who somehow manage to avoid unloading every available cent during their trip get a last chance to do so at the final stop before returning to the U.S. : the duty-free shops at practically every large international airport . The foreign-flight waiting rooms in these terminals are technically international territory , and concessionaires operating in them are not required to charge taxes . Most specialize in heavily taxed items , especially liquor , tobacco , cosmetics and perfume . But at some airports the careful shopper can also pick up excellent buys in cameras , radios , tape recorders , French cashmere sweaters , British woolen yard goods , Swiss watches and leather handbags , to name a few of the more widely available goodies . Some tips on airport emporiums : <P> LIQUOR . Returning U.S. citizens are limited by customs to one quart of duty-free spirits per person , so it hardly ever makes sense to buy more than that amount of hard liquor . But wines and other low-alcohol drinks are taxed at a much lower rate than , say , Scotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might find it worthwhile to lug more than one bottle back to the U.S. Oddly enough , local libations are not necessarily cheapest at home : Beefeater gin sells for $3.80 a quart at London 's Heathrow Airport , but for only $2.50 at Paris ' Orly and $2.85 at Amsterdam 's Schiphol . Popular brands of Scotch generally sell for $4 to $5 per quart in Europe , Africa and Asia . <P> TOBACCO . Cigarettes , which can be brought back to the U.S. in " reasonable " quantities , are priced lowest at the duty-free shops in Shannon , Johannesburg and Tokyo ( $2.40 per carton ) . Elsewhere they cost 25 to $1 more . Caution : locally manufactured versions of many U.S. brands are sold in parts of Europe and Africa . To some Americans they do not taste the same as their regular smokes . The point of manufacture is printed on each carton . <P> CAMERAS . Prices are lowest in Tokyo 's international airport at Haneda , but travelers to Japan would probably do better to make their purchase at one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection is much broader and prices almost the same . Sample prices at the airport : Nikkormat 35-mm . FTN with f-1.4 lens , $172 . The same camera costs $268 at Amsterdam 's Schiphol and $260 at Shannon , but it is still a bargain at either place compared with its $388 retail price in the U.S. <P> LOCAL CRAFT WORK . Since such items are normally not heavily taxed in the country of origin , they are usually not a bargain at the airport . Nevertheless , anyone who forgot to get something for Aunt Minnie can airport-shop for Indian applique work in Panama ( $8 ) , Welsh tapestry cloth in London ( $7 ) , Eskimo carvings in Montreal and local indigo-printed cloth in Nairobi ( $10 ) . Also available at some duty-free shops : locally produced canned delicacies.
