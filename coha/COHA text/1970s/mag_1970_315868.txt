For 46 years , under eight Presidents , J. Edgar Hoover has presided over the Federal Bureau of Investigation . He will be 76 on New Year 's Day , but the prickly views on everything from his former bosses to the " jackals of the press , " the frank prejudices , the devotion to the bureau pour forth with undiminished vigor . On the wall of his office is a mounted sailfish whose staring eyes are as steely as the chiefs own . There Hoover discussed a variety of topics with TIME Correspondent Dean Fischer . Excerpts from the interview : <P> ON REDUCING CRIME : First , there must be improvements in the training and salaries of law-enforcement officers . Second , there must be court improvements . Many judges do n't sit as long hours as they should ; they come in at ten o'clock , take a two-hour lunch break , and go home early in the evening . Third , there must be improvements in the penitentiaries . Some people come out worse than they went in . I have been accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of them . But I am vigorously opposed to the abuse of parole and probation . The bleeding hearts on parole boards ought to be a little tougher . In the matter of preventive detention people who commit serious felonies-rape , murder , hijacking and kidnaping-should be incarcerated until they 're tried , but it 's absolutely wrong that they should have to wait seven or eight months before their trials . <P> ON EXTREMIST GROUPS : Bombings are the most serious threat to society because of the activities of the Black Panthers , the S.D.S. and the Weathermen . You take last year , when 23 police officers were killed and 188 injured by black racial extremists . The Black Panthers are directly associated with guerrillas in Jordan and Algiers . They pose the worst threat from the standpoint of violence . <P> <P> ON PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT : We Cooperate with the Secret Service on presidential trips abroad . You never have to bother about a President being shot by Puerto Ricans or Mexicans . They do n't shoot very straight . But if they come at you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's IMAGE : We have recruited 50% of our 1,000 new agents from the officer corps in Viet Nam . You get a man who has been in command of men and he has to use good judgment . They all have to be above average in personal appearance . You wo n't find long hair or sideburns a la Namath here . There are no hippies . The public has an image of what an FBI agent should look like . <P> ON ROBERT KENNEDY : My differences with Bobby were very unfortunate . His father was one of my closest friends . He wanted me to lower our qualifications and to hire more Negro agents ... I said , " Bobby , that 's not going to be done as long as I 'm director of this bureau . " He said , " I do n't think you 're being cooperative . " And I said , " Why do n't you get a new director ? " I went over to see President Johnson and he told me to " stick to your guns . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
