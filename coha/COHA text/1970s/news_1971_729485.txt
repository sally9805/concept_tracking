Since , the price cutting started 11 days ago , the cost of a round-trip ticket for youthful travelers between the United States and Europe has been slashed on most routes by $150 to as . much as $505 , depending on the destination , season and length of stay . The public price war is the first in the history of the International Air Transport Association , ' which ordinarily sets identical fares by unanimous vote . The price competition ? which has created a chaotic patchwork of rates for young travelers at the threshold of the summer travel season ? applies so far only to travelers between the ages of 12 and 30 .

This is $375 under the basic economy rate and $150 less than the lowest discount rate on scheduled flights . Sabena 's prime motive was ; to compete with the low cost charter airlines that have been inreasingly diverting business , from scheduled airlines .

Confusion at Counters Airline ticket counters in Manhattan and elsewhere have been packed this week with young people buying tickets at the low rate or exchanging ones they had purchased previpusly at higher prices .
