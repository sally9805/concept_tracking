Movie advertising will trumpet sexual content ? and the lack of it ? more than ever . We will have more letters to remember than G , PG , R , and X. There may be a " Cincinnati R " and " Milwaukee G. " Movie critics will be required to memorize all of this , and I 'm going to ask for a raise . THE DEPICTION of violence in films is unaffected by the decision , which focuses on sexual conduct .

WRONG-HEADED law enforcement : Police who are looking for adults watching dirty movies ? as well as federal agents investigating interstate traffic in skin flicks  --  are not helping catch the serious criminals . This comes at a time when much of the public is afraid to walk city streets at night .
