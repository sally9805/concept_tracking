IN the dog days of last summer , International Telephone &; Telegraph Corp. , America 's biggest conglomerate , surprised investors by agreeing to sell a clutch of household names that it had acquired in recent years . Among them were home builders Levitt &; Sons , Avis Inc. and Hamilton Life Insurance . To ITT insiders , however , the decision was no surprise . Chairman Harold Geneen chose to sell because the alternative was a costly antitrust battle with the Justice Department that would have tied up his company in courts for years , and might still have ended in divestiture . <P> As part of the price for peace , ITT also agreed to make no more major acquisitions in the U.S. , an apparently crippling moratorium for a company that has relied heavily on mergers for its remarkable record of increased earnings for 49 consecutive quarters . But Geneen , a wily , English born accountant , had calculated the odds . In return for the U.S. companies that are on the block , ITT will get some $600 million . It will pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ITT in the U.S. , the trustbusters helped to provide the company with both the funds and the incentive to expand explosively-and create jobs-abroad . <P> Up from the Ranches . ITT has been growing fast in Europe , having acquired 16 firms in varied fields there this year . Telecommunications equipment accounts for about half of its European sales , and the company has expanded into automotive components , heating and ventilation equipment , and myriad other product areas . Last week the company named a new president for ITT-Eu-rope , which will have sales this year of about $2.7 billion , some 36% of the firm 's global total. - He is Michel C. Bergerac , 39 , who is almost as multinational as ITT itself . French-born " Mike " Bergerac is a naturalized U.S. citizen and has a home in Brussels . A Fulbright scholarship took Bergerac to the U.S. , where he earned a master 's degree in business administration at U.C.L.A. and traveled around working as a hired hand on Western ranches before entering the corporate world as a production manager for U.S. Divers Corp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes over ITT 's European operation at a time when the monetary crisis has added to the uncertainty about the future of most Continental economies . Even so , Bergerac says : " Europe remains our choice for growth . It has the potential , the kind of well managed companies we like to acquire . Some of our rivals are hesitating about expansion , but that is ITT 's opportunity . " <P> That opportunity will be greatly enhanced by ITT 's vaunted system of monthly European meetings . At these sessions , about 150 top managers from Europe and the U.S. review in detail the operations of each European company and product group . The European meetings cost ITT about $4,000,000 a year in travel , hotel , telecommunications , data processing and other expenses . Are they worth it ? ITT men point to the record : since the meetings started in 1961 , European profits have climbed 530%.
