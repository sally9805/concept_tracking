Sugar and price and disappearing documents <P> World sugar prices have plummeted from 65 per Ib. in 1974 to 7 today . That is good news for consumers , particularly for the country 's biggest user , Coca-Cola Co . Each 1 drop in sugar prices saves Coke $20 million a year . But the tumbling prices are bad news for domestic growers of sugar cane and sugar beets , who contend they need a price of 17 per Ib. to meet their production costs . <P> The price fluctuations set the stage for a bitter controversy that has raged in Washington for months . Senator Frank Church of Idaho has turned beet red and Senator Russell Long of Louisiana has raised cane in an attempt to boost Government price supports for sugar , now 13.5 per Ib. , to 17 . They are opposed by the Carter Administration , which insists that a price floor higher than 14.4 per Ib. would be inflationary . Last week the battle turned ugly when makers of corn fructose ( a sugar substitute ) accused the Administration of withholding documents needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was illegal . <P> But the dispute goes beyond prices . It also involves conflicting ideas of how the Government should help the sugar industry meet foreign competition . The Administration favors direct subsidies ; this would keep down prices to housewives and big consumers ( including Coca-Cola , which is headed by Carter 's old friend J. Paul Austin ) . But subsidizing low-priced sugar reduces demand for corn fructose . Congress favors sugar import duties and quotas , which would raise prices and help producers of both sugar and corn sweeteners . <P> In May 1977 , Carter rejected suggestions for import quotas and adopted a temporary program to pay producers up to 2 per lb. whenever the price of sugar dipped below 13.5 per Ib . The program was to stay in effect until Congress approved the International Sugar Agreement to stabilize world prices at between 15 and 19 per Ib. through Government stockpiling . Instead , Congress amended the farm bill , which became law Oct. 1 , with a program of loan supports , tariffs and import fees intended to satisfy producers of both kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growers and corn fructose producers , the Administration has dragged its feet in implementing the amendment . Tariffs were not imposed until November , and even then there were big loopholes that allowed foreign sugar to flood the U.S. market in December ( TIME , March 13 ) .
