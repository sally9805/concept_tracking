txt What price defense in today 's troubled world ? If you live in Israel the cost is 25 percent of the nation 's gross national product . In North Korea and North Vietnam the cost tops 20 percent , in Jordan it is 18 percent , in Egypt 13 percent , in Cuba a mere 6.1 percent . And the United States and Soviet Union each spend just over 8 percent of its gross national product . These statistics emerge from the latest annual global survey by the Institute for Strategic Studies ( ISS ) . This year it touches on the military strengths of some 94 countries , including Latin America for the first time , and gives wide coverage to the troubled Middle East . Despite evidence of a new political climate , including the opening of the strategic arms limitation talks ( SALT ) and negotiations over the Middle East , the institute reports a continuing buildup of arms and armed forces in " critical sectors . " Operational missiles East-West comparisons read thus : ? The Soviet Union continues to deploy its 20-25-megaton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 240 operational . ? Soviet land-based ICBMs now outnumber ( by 1,300 to 1,054 ) those of the United States , and construction of Soviet Y-class ballistic-missile nuclear submarines is between 5 and 10 a year . ? But the United States has entered a new era with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles ( MIRVs ) . A three-warhead system now is being deployed on Minuteman-3 missiles , and submarines are being converted to take 10-warhead MIRVs . So the U.S. warhead lead over the Soviets ( currently estimated at 7,502 to 5,662 ) should increase . ? Soviet armed forces and defense spending continues to edge upward ( the 1970 figure is $39,778,000,000 , while that of the U.S. dipped from $79,774,000,000 last year to $74,400,000,000 this , with a promise for further cutbacks . Focusing on the Middle East , the review states the Egyptian Army now has 70,000 more men than a year ago , and its Air Force is bigger and better equipped than at the time of the June , 1967 , war . Soviet advisers in Egypt , the study notes , have gone up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 100 Soviet MIG21 's in Egypt and some 22 Soviet-manned Sam-3 missile sites , with others being built . Marked imbalances In Europe , marked imbalances are shown when comparing NATO and Warsaw Pact Forces . While the West claims sea superiority , the Pact countries are superior on land when it comes to numbers of tanks , although NATO tanks tend to be more modern . When it comes to assessing an East-West confrontation , ISS says some 60 percent of U.S. missile-armed submarines can be kept on station at any time , while the Soviet maximum appears to be closer to 40 percent . The institute 's survey notes that in the case of a conventional aircraft attack , U.S. or British medium-range bombers stationed either in Europe or refueled in Europe ( or in the Pacific area ) could strike anywhere in the Warsaw Pact countries . // The U.S. has only 35 such medium-range bombers while Britain has 110 . Soviet bombers with a similar range , however , can strike at Canada or U.S. allies in Europe , but not the U.S. itself . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Soviet forces along the 7,000-mile border between the two countries is noted , although there has been no cutback in Soviet forces posted in Europe . Assessing Soviet and Chinese capabilities , the Soviets appear to have every advantage except manpower . They could destroy Chinese Air and Navy forces , cities , and nuclear capability . But if it came to a land war then the Soviets might find themselves in a protracted affair they neither could limit or win . The effect , says ISS , would be to split the Communist movement along racial lines and this would " do incalculable damage to Soviet prospects of retaining influence in the third world . " ISS director Francois Duchene notes that while the United States has reduced the number of its troops , the U.S.S.R. 's numbers remain " fairly static . " The 1970 study shows the Soviets have reduced the manpower within its divisions and increased its divisions from 148 to 157 . The increase in Soviet troops on the Chinese border is shown to have increased some 15 divisions over the past two years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the previous edition . Worldwide circulation continues to grow . The institute 's researchers now are working on a study of the world 's guerrilla organizations . It realizes , Mr. Duchene says , " something must be done about them . "
