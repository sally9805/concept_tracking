Even before he died last year in an automobile accident at the age of 49 , the peasant known as Arig had become a legend in his native Brazil . Claiming to be guided by the wise voice of a long-deceased physician whom he had never known personally , the uneducated healer saw as many as 300 patients a day , diagnosing and treating them in minutes . For some he suggested minor surgery , frequently performing the operations himself with a pocketknife . For others he recommended drugs , writing prescriptions for unorthodox pharmacological combinations that somehow worked . He treated almost every known ailment , and most of his patients not only survived but actually improved or recovered . <P> A few years ago , reports on the exploits of such miracle workers would have drawn little more than derision from the scientifically trained . Now , however , many medical researchers are showing a new open-mindedness toward so-called psychic healing and other methods not taught in medical schools . Of the more than 400 doctors , engineers and biophysicists attending a four-day conference on parapsychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to endorse Arig 's methods . But they were willing to listen as Dr. Henry Puharich , formerly on the faculty of New York University Medical Center , confirmed some of the Brazilian 's cures . <P> Puharich told the conference that his research team had studied firsthand 1,000 of Arig 's cases without learning how the healer made his diagnoses or effected his cures . " But , " said Puharich , " our nice modern equipment proved that genuine healing took place under bizarre conditions and unbelievable circumstances . Clearly we have a lot of research ahead of us . " <P> The Stanford conference was full of other tantalizing phenomena that seem to merit thorough investigation . Olga Worrall , director of the New Life Clinic at the Mount Vernon Methodist Church in Baltimore , told how she had cured warts and emotional disorders , and even helped cancer patients by the laying on of hands . Dr. Robert Bradley , a Denver obstetrician who is also president of the American Academy of Parapsychology and Medicine , reported on the use of hypnotherapy , long ago proven effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from surgical wounds . <P> Elmer Green , director of the Psychophysiology Laboratory at the Menninger Foundation , described new findings about the effectiveness of " biofeed-back . " In this technique , the patient is taught to achieve some degree of control over such normally involuntary functions as heart rate and blood flow . Using electronic sensors that tell the patient when he has succeeded in altering some internal function , Green and others have been able to train patients to avoid or relieve migraine headaches , control the body processes that may cause ulcers , and raise and lower their body temperature .
