txt Many observers here think the key issue in the midterm election will be the economy . There are signs in President Nixon 's televised speech that he thinks so too . For millions of workers the key facts in the economy are jobs and cost of living . Both factors are presently adverse to Mr. Nixon , as politicians estimate it : Unemployment has risen to 5 percent and is likely to stay there for the year , and inflation continues at more than 6 percent . President Nixon now has entered a strong administration statement on this subject which will be offered again and again by his party in the months to come . He finds four main reasons for the current slump which he acknowledges is under way . . 1 . Inflation began under the Democrats when they engaged in deficit spending . 2 . Unemployment is due in part to the transition from a war to a peacetime economy . 3 . The Democratic Congress has delayed passage of remedial legislation and , by inference , played politics . // // 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lag in productivity , which is primarily the responsibility of management and workers . Washington was surprised that Mr. Nixon did not offer a larger bundle of remedies for the slump ; there had been speculation that he was coming around to some form of guidelines or voluntary controls . But the only concession he made in that direction was to ask his Council of Economic Advisers to make surveys of wage and price increases and to prepare a periodic " inflation alert . " This alert would be implemented by his new **25;343;TOOLONG group , the national commission of productivity . Critics were quick to pounce on the fact that the " alert " would be sounded after the event and not before ; they likened it to an " alert " for a bombing raid made after it happened . Most economists agree with Mr. Nixon 's explanation that inflation got under way in 1965.66 due to the failure to meet the increased war costs of Vietnam by higher taxes . Argument diluted There is also reason for believing that cutbacks in defense spending have put some workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling is that this is not the real cause of the slump , which is attributed in large part to the government 's planned means of combating inflation , particularly tight money . Mr. Nixon 's argument that the country is moving from a " war " to peacetime economy is also diluted by the fact that the United States has never really had a " war " economy but has fought Vietnam on the theory of having guns and butter , too . Many feel here , too , that Congress has been negligent in not expanding the unemployment insurance system and in passing the manpower training bill proposed by the White House . Committee chairmen , however , argue that until recently the White House has not placed special urgency on these measures . Apprehension expressed In the field of declining productivity , most observers feel that this is a symptom of the slump rather than the cause of it , and that in a cost-push inflation the statistic of productivity declines . " Productivity , " it is noted , is not merely the failure of a worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given time , but also involves policies of management , like keeping a surplus of workers on hand , or holding back raw material . Mr. Nixon 's proposals seem to indicate that he intends to ride out the storm without doing anything very drastic about it . Many private economists believe the slump has touched bottom , and will recover by itself if left alone . On the other hand , there is real apprehension by some respected economists of the activist school . Sonic of them express shock that the White House does not plan stronger Measures . Nearly everybody agrees that unemployment at around 5 to 6 percent will Continue through the election . It normally takes half a year or so to turn the economy around . On the political side this is bad news for the White House . Voters normally attribute good or bad times to the president rather than to previous administrations . President Nixon repeatedly referred to political matters . To some it seemed as much a political as an economic speech . In listing pending bills Mr. . Nixon interpolated. the phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he seemed to catch . time as he repeated the phrase . Mr. Nixon has leveled a mounting number of criticisms on the Democratic Congress : Many think it will be an election theme . Political hot potato Congress passed him a hot potato in the form of an authorization to use wage or price controls . " This is not the time for the Congress to play politics with inflation , " he : said scornfully . He taunted congressmen who follow what , he called the " old and cynical adage " that ' in an election year one should vote for ex- ' penditures and against taxes . He called it : " political arithmetic . " Mr. Nixon spoke harshly of " some people who get satisfaction out of seeing an indi- : vidual businessman or labor leader called . on the carpet and browbeaten by govern ; merit officials . " Advocates of guidelines , or the so-called : incomes policy or " jawboning " felt that this . caricatured their proposals .
