Thieves in Cleveland had better begin stepping lively . Last month a young man filched a $15.98 bag from Hermes Track and Racquet Shop and walked blithely away . But he was reckoning without Shopowner Gary Easter , 31 , a former Cleveland policeman and marathoner who runs ten miles a day . Easter quickly locked up the store and gave chase . <P> Soon the thief , who by then was running , threw the bag at Easter , huffing , " I do n't want it . It 's not worth this . " But Easter just kept coming . The thief , by now badly winded , jettisoned some more excess baggage , including a small scale for weighing letters that he had apparently shoplifted from another store . Still Easter kept gaining . Finally the exhausted thief collapsed in a parking lot . " I give up , " he wheezed , whereupon Easter hauled him to the nearest police station . Easter 's quarry , Mark Reese , 31 , pleaded guilty to assault and theft and got 30 days in jail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
