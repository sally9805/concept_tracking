txt " Pardon our past bragging . The truth is .. .. " Increasingly , Americans will be reading advertisements like this which , though couched in more subtle , guiltless prose , are aimed at correcting past exaggerated claims about the nutritiousness , weight-reducing , cure-all capacities of some foods and drugs . The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) , charged with policing deceptive ad practices , has long been criticized for action that is too little and too late . By the time the legal wheels begin to roll against one advertising practice , a new campaign is usually well under way anyway . Under consent proceedings by which a majority of FTC ad cases are settled , the accused agrees merely to stop the practice ( or face a fine ) but admits no guilt . A mere tap on the wrist , say critics . Slowly the commission , generally considered the most forceful of Washington 's regulatory agencies at the moment , has been adding some strong new tools to its arsenal . One of these , reserved for serious cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory that the impressions and impact of a deceptive ad can linger on well after an ad campaign is over , this remedial measure has been required now by the FTC in three cases and is a pending consequence in another dozen cases now in litigation . Corrective ads have already begun to appear in the case of ITT Continental Baking Company 's Profile Bread . The company agreed under a consent order to devote 25 percent of its advertising over the next year to " correcting " the unsubstantiated claim that the bread is particularly effective for reducing weight . // *FTC has advertisers eating their words // Similar diet claims ( urging consumption of sugar and sugar foods before meals ) will be discounted in seven magazine ads sponsored by the Sugar Association , Inc. , and Sugar Information , Inc. , beginning in December . Some critics contend this eat-your-words kind of solution is still the gentlest of reprimands . In the third case in which the FTC has required such corrective action , for instance , Ocean Spray cranberry drink , which has been promoted recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concede that its claims of being more nutritious than orange or tomato juice are unfounded and that its assertions of " more food energy " simply means more calories . However , many who read the corrective ads probably will have no inkling that Ocean Spray is admitting anything . Indeed , the correction which in some cases will read " if you 've been confused by breakfast drink advertising that talks about energy , let Ocean Spray set the record straight . . . " may well be viewed by some as a generous , public-service announcement . ' Remedial not punitive ' " We ca n't require anyone to take a full page ad saying , ' we lied , ' " counters Gerald J. Thain , who heads up the staff of 30 attorneys in the FTC 's national-advertising division . He argues that the corrective device which he describes as " remedial not punitive " and aimed only at depriving advertisers of fruits illegally gained is an effective preventative tool . He says he thinks it has contributed to added caution by companies in making claims which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , top company officials are increasingly involving themselves in this issue , a sign which Mr. Thain terms " hopeful . " Also , though the " corrective " concept has not yet faced up to a court test , the FTC may soon be employing it more toughly . Specific retractions In a case under litigation involving nutritious claims of Wonder Bread ( a decision by the FTC 's administrative law judge is expected in mid-December ) , the company may well be asked to run corrective ads specifically including FTC findings . In another case involving three major manufacturers of nonprescription analgesic drugs also under litigation , it is considered quite likely that corrective ads , if required , would be mandatory for two years instead of the usual one year . Other new FTC weaponry includes advertising substantiation orders which have been issued to six major industries such as soaps and airconditioners . Backup evidence for claims is required in such cases and that information is then available to the public , though Mr. Thain admits that the terminology is often too technical to help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of service as translators . Counter advertising Another much disciissed weapon is counter advertising which the FTC is on record as supporting . The contention here is that advertising announcements on controversial issues of public importance tend to be one-sided and should be subject to the so-called fairness doctrine which requires an airing of more than one side . The proposal is highly controversial in itself but Mr. Thain argues it could be responsible for " some of the most interesting time periods on television . " The FTC has consistently argued that ads should be informational as well as persuasive and that , contrary to the business view , the two terms are not mutually exclusive . In the future , Mr. Thain predicts that the FTC advertising staff will be taking a harder look at cosmetic advertising and at environmental claims . Also , FTC 's authority to guard against " unfair " as well as misleading and deceptive ads will be more fully explored he says . Though largely an undefined area to date , unfairness to the consumer was the FTC argument in the case of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied Sunday newspapers .
