Art Williams was n't exactly nervous before those games in which he worked behind the plate , but still there was something , a gnawing , doubting sensation . Being a black man in a white man 's world was hard ; being an umpire , a lawman in a game where his every judgment could influence a man 's career  --  that was even more difficult . Art Williams , the first black umpire in the National League , was doing his best . Yet there were times , especially every fourth game when it was his turn to call the plate , that an uneasiness set in . This was an umpire 's most difficult and tiring job . This was the time when all eyes were unavoidably on him . // Early one evening in the umpires ' room at Jarry Park in Montreal , Williams stripped down to his shorts , carried the boxes of new baseballs and a can of Delaware River mud into the bathroom and sat down near the sink . Nick Colosi , Doug Harvey and Harry Wendelstedt , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing room talking quietly . // The previous night had been an excruciatingly bad one for Williams , his worst of the year . He had been working first base and doing what he considered to be a competent job when the fleet Montreal shortstop , Tim Foli , hit a slow ground ball to third . It looked as if it would be a close play , but Williams was on it , stepping into the slot to the right and at a 45-degree angle from first base , dropping down on one knee to see the ball slap the first baseman 's glove and the runner 's foot touch the base . The ball beat the runner by nearly half a step , and Williams jumped , whirled , raised his right fist and yelled , " Out ! " // Then , for a split second , he was confused . The fans were cheering , and his fancy movement on the out call left him somewhat off-balance . He might have lost sight of the play , he was n't sure , but the next thing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His fist , signaling out , still hung like a hammer in the air as he reran the play in his mind . Had Foli knocked the ball out of the first baseman 's glove ? Interference ? He thought so . " Out ! " he bellowed again . // " He dropped the ball ! The first baseman dropped the ball ! " Foli yelled . // " No , he 's crazy ! " the first baseman yelled , motioning at Foli . " He grabbed the ball . He grabbed it ! " // " You 're wrong ! " First Base Coach Walt Hriniak bellowed the words into Williams ' face . " You 're wrong , wrong , wrong ! " // The three men crowded around the umpire , shouting , jumping up and down like angry dogs . Williams shut his eyes for an instant , remembering Doug Harvey 's words : " I 'm telling you , son , you ca n't let them double-team you , triple-team you , quadruple-team you . You tell them like I always tell them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only . I 'll talk to one man or no man at all . ' " // But Williams knew he had hesitated too long , losing the advantage of his authority . He stood there , paralyzed . Then he composed himself and opened his mouth , with the intention of clearing the field , when Hriniak suddenly stepped forward and bumped him . Instinctively , Williams pushed the man back , hard . " You 're gone , " he yelled , pointing to the dugout . " Get out of here ! " // " You pushed me , you .... " Hriniak rushed forward and bumped him again . Williams held his ground and his temper . " You 're gone ! You 're gone ! Get out ! Get out ! " His arm shot out once more toward the dugout . // Simultaneously , Harvey , Wendelstedt and Expo Manager Gene Mauch reached first base and pulled the men apart , but Williams knew the damage had been done . An umpire must control himself and the situation . He should never let himself exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dejectedly in his sweat-soaked blue uniform . Harvey said , " You ca n't ever allow yourself to become off-balance . You 've got to plant both feet and keep your eyes on the play until you 're sure it has concluded . It takes eight years in the major leagues to make a good umpire , Art , and you have n't been in for even two . " // That night Williams paced his room , composing the right words to use in explaining the incident to League President Chub Feeney . Williams was n't worried that Feeney would fire him . It had n't been that bad a mistake , and Feeney was a good and fair man . But it was unsettling , embarrassing . // Feeney was n't the man who had hired him , of course . Fred Fleig , the National League secretary and supervisor of umpires , was the one who had called him after only three years of minor league ball , to ask if he thought he could work in the majors . He remembered that night very well . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered a number of things . // In 1953 , Art Williams , a right-handed pitcher , was the first black to be signed by the Detroit Tigers organization , receiving a $100 bonus . Directly out of high school he was assigned to the Tigers ' Class A farm team in his hometown of Bakersfield , Calif. ; he had an 11-6 record that season . The next year he was offered a contract to play AAA ball in Buffalo , but the Tigers refused him travel money to spring training . So Williams rejected the offer and was sent to the Tigers ' team in Idaho Falls . He pitched well there for the first half of the season , and then he hurt his arm . Despite his physical troubles , he had a 9-3 record . // But still , after coming up with a sore arm so early in his career , Williams felt his prospects for the future were significantly diminished . He turned down an offer to play Class A ball in Augusta , Ga . the following year , on the advice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spiritual health . Instead , Williams signed with the Wanetka Tigers in the now defunct Class C California League and , at the suggestion of Tiger scout Joe Gordon , agreed to pitch a game every other day . " This is the only way you 're going to prove to our management that your arm is strong enough for big-league ball , " Gordon told the young pitcher . // Whether the advice was faulty or downright cruel , Williams still is n't completely certain 20 years later . In any case , he wore out his arm while pitching as many games as possible for the next two years . He won twice as many as he lost , but never once received any indication he was being scouted and considered for advancement in the Detroit or any other pro baseball organization . He returned home at the start of the 1957 season and unobtrusively retired from the game , so disappointed that he swore to his wife Shirley that he would never again involve himself in baseball . He would never watch a game , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories of those years into the deepest corners of his mind . // A second Williams child was now on the way , and Art went to work for the Bakersfield Sanitation Department . He was soon promoted to supervisor , and worked there for the next 12 years overseeing from 120 to 150 men . His family grew to five children , and for extra cash he took a part-time job with the recreation department . He also started attending classes at Bakersfield Junior College and began refereeing high school basketball . For seven years he kept his peace with baseball , remaining isolated from the game . But when his eldest son , Art Jr. , began playing Little League ball , Williams agreed to help umpire . // Before he really realized what was happening , Williams moved up to high school and college games . Within two years he was the most skillful and sought-after umpire in amateur baseball in Kern County . In the winter of 1969 , with his wife 's reluctant blessing , Williams enrolled in the Major League Umpire Development Program and spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of former Triple A umpire Barney Deary . // At the time , the federal government , armed with comparatively new civil-rights legislation , was beginning to eye with suspicion the hiring practices of National and American League officials . Close to half of all the players in the major leagues were members of minority groups , yet there was only one black umpire , Emmett Ashford in the American League , and he would retire the following year . // " I got a call from the National League office in San Francisco , " says a major league umpire who had been working as an instructor for the umpire development program in St. Petersburg that winter . " They wanted to know if there were any good black candidates and asked me to pick the best so that they could be sure he got a job . Not that these blacks might n't have been offered jobs anyway , but there were about 200 candidates that year for 30 or 40 jobs , and they wanted to be sure a black was hired . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had that year  --  maybe the best we ever had  --  but what I liked about him was , well , he was respectful . " // Williams was hired by the Pioneer League in the Northwest that year for $525 a month for three months , including expenses . Simultaneously , he gave up his job with the sanitation department , where he had earned $11,000 annually . Shirley was forced to go back to work that year and for the next four years , but Art was certain of his ability to move up to the big leagues . // He was promoted to the Class A Midwest League in 1970 and traveled with another black umpire , Harold Van , who had been in baseball for a number of years and was , at the time , a National League prospect . One evening in Appleton , Wis. , after a particularly difficult game , a tall , broad-shouldered , gray-haired man came into the umpires ' room and engaged Van in quiet conversation . Later the stranger walked over and spoke to Williams . // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked gruffly. // Williams told him . // " Well , I think you did a fine job out there tonight . Just keep on hustling. " // Later , Van said , " Well , you got yourself a fan . That man do n't know what the word compliment means , but he handed one out to you . " // " Who is he ? " // " That 's Fred Fleig , the supervisor of umpires in the National League  --  the man who does the hiring and firing . " // Williams worked hard for the rest of that season , harder perhaps than at any time in his life . Often he would spend his nights curled up in the back seat of his car and he washed and shaved at local gas stations to save a few dollars to send home . // Since major league ball clubs invite many extra players to spring training camps and divide their teams into groups , minor league umpires help officiate . Williams was included in a group of two dozen in January 1971. // He officiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remembers best about that month he spent in Arizona was a game between the Giants and Padres worked by the veteran umpire Doug Harvey , who was to become his crew chief in the majors . Williams , who had finished his game earlier in the day , was sitting on the sidelines watching him . // Near the end of the game , Harvey walked toward Williams . " You 're Art Williams , " he said , offering his hand . " Nice to know you . // " Look , I 've got a problem , " he added . " I just bought a house in San Diego and I 've got to make a plane in 45 minutes to get back to sign the papers and close the deal . I wonder if you could take over for me behind the plate ? " // " You want me to call the plate for you ? With Willie Mays coming up ? " // " The pitches do n't come in any different to Mays than to anybody else . You call your own game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five weeks of the 1971 season he was assigned to the Double A Texas League . But when veteran National League umpire Tony Venson had a heart attack , John McSherry of the Triple A International League was promoted to the majors , and Williams moved up a notch , assuming McSherry 's position . He remained in the International League that year , working the playoffs , and then returning both to major league spring training and to the International League in 1972 . Again he was selected to work the Little World Series , and since it was to be held in Hawaii , Williams was planning to take Shirley along . // Then one day the phone rang in the small frame house in the south side of Bakersfield . Shirley was in the kitchen . Soon Art came in and stood in the doorway . // " What now ? " asked Shirley . // " That was Mr. Fleig , " said Williams . " We 're not going to Hawaii because ... starting tomorrow ... I 'll be in the major leagues . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure other people have thought of it and used it , that 's a word I 've made up on my own . Overhustle . It perfectly describes my outlook on life , the way I conduct myself on the field , off the field , on the road , or at home . // " I do n't want nobody to talk about me in this league , you see , because the way things are , with me the first and only black umpire , if they talk about me , they talk about my race . That 's the way people are . I do n't want nobody talking about me . That 's the one thing I would hate , so I work real hard until I 'm sure people know that I 'm just one of the guys , ' cause that 's exactly what I want to be . // " In everything I do , everywhere I go , in all of my life , I overhustle . That 's the word . A ball 's hit down the line , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cause I do n't want anyone to be able to say I 'm lazy , that blacks are lazy . // " When it comes to sharing a taxi fare , or picking up a tab in a restaurant , I always try to buy more than my share , two beers to everyone else 's one , because I do n't want anyone to say I 'm cheap , or that blacks are cheap . // " I overhustle . I want to carry my load and I want everyone in the whole damn league , in the whole country , to know I 'm doing it . // " There are a lot of umpires in the minor leagues , and right up here in the majors , who are jealous of me because I 'm black and have gotten a few breaks because of it . But they do n't know , do n't realize , that I 've also lost out on many opportunities earlier in life for the same blackness . They do n't understand , furthermore , that I ca n't help my color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " I resent being called a token black by reporters . I get that all the time . ' How does it feel to be the token black umpire in the major leagues ? ' they ask me. // " ' I 'm not a token anything , ' I tell them . ' I 'm an umpire . It 's as pure and simple as that . ' // " Sometimes I call a black player out on a close play and he looks up at me , surprised . They are actually surprised . And they say to me , ' Hey , brother , you could have given me a break . ' // " Well , I do n't like that . They ai n't doing me any good and they ai n't doing my race any good . They are jeopardizing my authority , my position and my job . On the field , I ai n't nobody 's brother . They 're players and I 'm an umpire . // " In a way , " says Williams , " umpires and black people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're both outcasts . We both find comfort and friendship only with our own kind . " // Now , sitting on a stool in front of the sink in the umpires ' room in Jarry Park , the big black man splattered saliva and mud on the last baseball to be tossed into the ball bag . Sighing , he kneaded the mud into the cover with a silent fury . // Then he began the long process of dressing and preparing for a game behind the plate . First , he dug into his suitcase until he found the bottoms to a pair of long , gray knit underwear . This was the same underwear he had worn for his first major league assignment almost two years before . He had , in fact , worn these same long Johns for each plate appearance since that time , but today he felt in need of a new good-luck charm . Or no good-luck charm . He would confront this plate job wholly on his own . He rolled the underwear into a loose ball , then tossed it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of underwear , then stood and dragged the elasticized cotton material up his muscular legs . He sat down and pulled on a pair of knee-high woolen socks , then strapped on a pair of catcher 's shin guards made of shiny blue heavy-duty plastic . // Next he pulled on his pants . He slipped into a pair of black oxfords , laced them tightly and got to his feet . His shoes had an elongated leather-wrapped steel tongue , which extended from toe to ankle , meeting the lower portion of the shin guard . // He pulled his padded chest protector down from a shelf and paused for a second . " Shirts or jackets tonight , chief ? " he said to Harvey . // " Jackets . " // Williams nodded , buckled his chest protector over his undershirt , slipped a short-sleeved light-blue shirt over the protector , then pulled on his navy-blue jacket . He looked as if he were wearing a 1940s-style zoot suit . // Harvey looked at Colosi and Williams . " Where the hell is Harry ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , leaped in the air , twisted around and landed in the main room with a barefoot thud . He had shed his underwear and stood in the middle of the room , staring sheepishly at his partners and wearing a T shirt on which he had drawn a large swastika in blue ballpoint ink . Neatly lettered above the swastika were the words Super Kraut. // " Super Kraut ! " he yelled , pounding his chest , then goose-stepping around and around the room . " Look ! Up in the sky ! It 's a bird ! It 's a plane ! It 's Super Kraut ! Super Kraut ! Super Kraut ! " // Harvey , Colosi and Williams watched as the big man twirled and paraded . They began to chuckle as he continued to perform , then finally exploded in great gusts of laughter . Harry Wendelstedt , as straight-faced , apple-cheeked and imperturbable as ever , put on his clothes , his light-blue short-sleeved shirt , his navy-blue pants and suit jacket . He laced his black oxfords and led the crew out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umpires strangely , then began winking at one another , but none would ever quite understand why these usually grim-lipped men periodically chuckled and guffawed through the game . Nor would the fans ever know , even imagine , that one of the men in the blue suit of authority wore a swastika over his heart as a joke . // Art Williams felt the fog and the weight above his eyes lift as he walked slowly out onto the field . He accepted the lineups from both managers with an authoritative nod , checked his digital ball-strike counter , and loaded up his pockets with five newly rubbed baseballs . He stood erect and respectful through the Canadian and American anthems . // With a great deal of satisfaction , as the dying music reverberated in the park , he turned to the visiting team 's dugout , raised his arm in a sharp , snapping manner and yelled , " PLAY BALL ! "
