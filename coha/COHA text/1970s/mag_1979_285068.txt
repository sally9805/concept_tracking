The White House and Congress reappraise nuclear safety <P> Without warning , a second nuclear era had begun . Gone was the industry 's and government 's confidence of old ; reappraisal and caution would now be the order of the day . The unthinkable had come perilously close to happening , causing second thoughts about the form of energy that promises to relieve dependence on ever diminishing , ever more expensive fossil fuel supplies . <P> For six riveting days , the nation-and the world-watched a gas bubble build up in a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island near Harrisburg , Pa. , and threaten to cause a hydrogen gas explosion that would spew radiation into the atmosphere . When the bubble finally disappeared and the danger subsided , deep relief was mingled with grave concern about the nuclear future . <P> Across the U.S. and abroad , protesters poured into the streets in a flashback to the strife-torn 1960s ; a new cause had galvanized supporters . Proponents of nuclear energy were on the defensive , and the critics exulted in a chorus of I-told-you-so 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Massachusetts State Representative Richard Roche shouted , " We 're in the mainstream now ! " Said Brett Bursey , a leader of the antinuclear Palmetto Alliance in South Carolina , where there are four nuclear plants in operation and six under construction : " In the last few days , people have learned more about nuclear power than at any time since the inception of the industry . It 's been this incredibly intensive educational course . " <P> The accident could hardly have occurred at a worse time . The U.S. now imports almost half of the oil it consumes , and the OPEC nations continued last week to sting the industrialized world with price increases , thus adding to the nation 's already soaring inflation rate . The U.S. had been counting on nuclear energy to achieve a greater degree of energy independence , but the Three Mile Island accident helped demonstrate that there is no easy path to self-sufficiency . The use of each kind of energy has its own particular problems or risks . Says David Rosenbaum , a consultant to the General Accounting Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The public has been deluded into thinking that if all the scientists just buckle down , they can figure it all out . That 's not true . When you have a modern , complicated technology , you just ca n't calculate everything . " <P> Washington was alive with investigations and promises of investigations to find out what went so terribly wrong at the Metropolitan Edison Co. plant . In his major energy address Thursday night , Jimmy Carter preceded his call for phased decontrol of oil prices and a windfall tax on petroleum companies ( see ECONOMY &; BUSINESS ) with the announcement that he would appoint an independent commission to look into the accident and make recommendations for improving the safety of all nuclear plants . Said the President : " You deserve a full accounting , and you will get it . "
