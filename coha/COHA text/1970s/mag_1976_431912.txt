 | SILENCE ON CAMPUS A FORMER STUDENT stopped by my office the other day . I remembered her instantly . Every teacher has a small collection of students , arranged carefully in a trophy case , to be brought down and examined in low periods . I 've had maybe a dozen in eight years of teaching , and Susan was one . She came to the Irvine campus of the University of California as a 18 transfer student in 1970 ? a white , upper-middle-class product of southern California , blonde , pretty , athletic -- and unhappy . She was tearing at her own roots , reluctantly , but she knew it was inevitable . It was a painful process that she tried to put on paper , not very successfully . From those agonized writings of hers , I learned that her parents were politically and socially conservative , and that Susan ? thoughtful but not belligerent ? had gone off to the Santa Barbara campus of the University of California in the late 1960 There she found herself increasingly disturbed at American activities in Vietnam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disenchantment with them . Because . activism was not her style , Susan a , as pulled between the strong need to declare herself and dismay at d has seemed to her the excesses of some of her fellow students . Then the United States invaded Cambodia , and American campuses . erupted in protest . Susan saw policemen swarm into her campus community and drag students from their rooms and beat them up outside . Outraged and sickened , she joined the demonstrators , was picked up in a police dragnet , and spent two night in jail before being released without any charges preferred against her . She transferred to my campus the following fall , and as a student in my writing class tried to articulate the changes that were taking place in her , to put them . in perspective without breaking completely from her rootsTo some of the people in her hometown , this concerned young woman had been radicalized by university left-wingers when she graduated a year later . I did n't see Susan again until a few weeks ago . After working for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a graduate degree . earning her room and board a a counselor in a freshman dormitory . She was depressed over what she had seen and heard . She had been asked ? and had agreed ? to help organize a student movement against a law that would effectively disenfranchise students by preventing them from registering to vote at their university home . Susan felt deeply about thi- : she had once worked very hard to extend the vote to eighteen-year-old -- For university students , those efforts would be thwarted by the new law . Petitions in hand , Susan worked her way through the dormitories . " It was awful , " she said . " There was n't the slightest interest among those students in what was being taken from them . They were n't aware , and they did n't want to listen to me . I came away defeated . I just could n't believe the change that has taken place in college students in the last few years . " @#  | I HAVE FOUND it hard to believe , too ? particularly because the change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , and I tend to give students a lot of latitude in subject matter . Three-fourths of the essays I read five years ago dealt with some form of social change . Now they hear such titles as " How Students Can Invest in the Stock Market " or " How I Became a Christian . " A lot of Americans ? most of them , I suspect ? are relieved at the quiet that has fallen over our college campuses after the chaos of the Vietnam war years . I am not . The passive students today alarm me far more than the activists of a few years ago ever did . They are , I 'm sure , the inevitable result of two things. : public- hostility toward the universities during the hyperactivist years and private disenchantment not always rational ? among young people over their inability to dent the system . There is little question that many colleges today are being punished for the campus upheavals that took place during the war years . Public officials who always feared and suspected free-wheeling intellectual give-andtake have used citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus activism ) as a club to beat down university budgets and anesthetize the troublemaking potential of students and faculty alike . When Richard Nixon became President , the federal government spent $262 million annually to help support 51,400 graduate students in our universities ; when he left office , federal support had shrunk to $33 million for 6,600 graduate students . At the same time , inflation was putting college out of reach for a growing segment of our society . During the same period at the University of California , I have watched faculty salaries go down relative to other top universities , research projects with considerable potential for public benefit aborted , and faculty-student ratios climb , as a result of a state administration that has denigrated its own fine university whenever possible . Moreover , this decrease in university funds and support has accompanied a wave of postactivist students who seem to reflect these public attitudes . Last year , a high-school civics teacher wrote to a Los Angeles news- paper : " The majority of young people with whom I come in contact was never enthralled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even deeper into an apolitical torpor . Watergate taught them not to care . I see the silent majority growing in my classroom every school day . It is a frightening development . " Other evidence is all around . When the University of California at San Diego opened a new school recently that stressed " professional and preprofessional training , " it was immediately oversubscribed in a period of generally declining admissions elsewhere . This response , the provost explained , was due to " a new breed of student who is thinking more about jobs , money , and the future . " A study by the Rockefeller Youth Task Force found that " the challenge of traditional cultural values has shifted to non-college youth , " and the task force director , Daniel Yankelovich , added : " In a brief fiveyear period , the- gap between the campus and the country has begun to close , but a new gap between working youth who have not gone to college and the country 's social institutions is now opening up . If this means that healthy challenges to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young working class , it may also mean that the challenges will be more effective . But if it means that the young have simply detached themselves from social activism and criticism , we are in trouble . I pondered these questions the other night on my way home from a talk I had given to a group of socialscience classes at a local high school . My oldest daughter had been a student in this high school when John Kennedy was murdered . She had sat numbly in a classroom for a few minutes , then walked out of school and several miles to the ocean , where she sat on the beach alone until darkness drove her home . She had been expelled for this agonized act , and I vividly remember my own anger and outrage when I took her case before the school authorities . Speaking in that same school a little more than a decade later , it came as a shock to me that many of the young people in my audience were no more inspired by John Kennedy than by Grover Cleveland or Millard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized we were n't even on the same planet . I was assuming certain social awarenesses and interests the obviously did n't have , so I tried to penetrate the glaze over their eves with more and more outrageous statements , hoping for some kind of response . Anything at all . When nothing came back , I began asking them questions . And , slowly I began to see that I was dealing with students who had happily accepted the social and political changes won by the activists of the 1960s , and totally discarded the commitment that produced the changes . At last I asked these students if they would be enough outraged to demonstrate if we started massive bombing of Vietnam again tomorrow . Nothing . In desperation , I said : " For God 's sake . what would outrage you ? " After a pause , a girl in the front row wearing a cheerleader uniform raised her hand and said tentatively , " Well . F d be pretty mad if they bombed this school . " @# I RECOGNIZE THAT this is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that generalizing from such an experience is dangerous . But from this same background came young people who marched in Mississippi and unseated a President of the United States in New Hampshire , who demanded and got long overdue educational reforms , who - broke down outmoded social casteand attitudes . True , they also disrupted classes , undermined useful social values and traditions , loved the sounds of their own voices , and frequently substituted rhetoric for reason and self-indulgent impulse for effective action . They were noisy and abrasive , and when it was all over , I was relieved . For a while . But now I contemplate the reaction and I wonder about our future . Now I 'm told to honk if I love Jesus . I hear students dismiss Watergate as " the way it 's always been , so why hassle it ? " I see them singlemindedly pursuing grades and worrying about jobs with secure retirement plans . I even see a resurgence of those pillars of the American social caste system , fraternities and sororities . When I express dismay about these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My own children formed ideologically by the Kennedy years ? tell me I 'm a crashing idealist as far as young people are concerned , that I should never have imputed all those selfless motives to the activists of . the Sixties . By way of corroboration , they point out that the demonstrations stopped almost immediately after the military draft was suspended . The point is well taken , and I 've not heard any students of that period deny it when faced with this fact . But it is also true that the threshold of social and political awareness ? for whatever reason ? was extraordinarily high , was acted on , and produced results that in my view were mostly progressive and badly needed . Student activism had a direct effect on our slow withdrawal from Vietnam , on the eighteen-year-old vote , on progress in the black and other minority communities , on women 's rights , and on the critical examination of religious , ethical , and institutional values that were out of step with the world in which we lived . Admittedly , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat of these side effects was allowed to obscure the progress initiated by the students of the Sixties . Some of my old activist student friends are still around and in touch . One is working as an organizer for a trade union , fighting that monolith from within , while he writes and tries to publish impassioned exposes of the perfidy and greed of the automobile industry . Another is writing poetry in a secluded southern California canyon and repairing automobiles for a living . A young woman who worked for Robert Kennedy and saw him killed is struggling through law school so she can join the young attorneys who are fighting our system on behalf of the powerless . A determined young man is trying to finish graduate school so he can teach , bedding down in various offices around the campus because inflation and rising university fees have made it impossible for him to afford a room . These people are oddly anachronistic on campus today , artifacts of a time and place that seem light years away . Meanwhile , as noted by Prof. Martin Marty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The people , " writes Professor Marty , " have tended to turn from those who disturbed the peace with manifestos , experiments , or searching questions . Where people now rise above apathy at all , they seem to want only to be soothed . Today 's prophets are invited to dinner , where they offer the sweets . " The good citizens who are - relieved at this state of affairs might ponder the possibility that a group like the Symbionese Liberation Army arises , not from a society of young people working actively to correct social injustice , but from a society where injustice is ignored . Without responsible activism to contain them , revolutionaries can turn into dangerous , demented , and frustrated people , toting machine guns and a death wish . At the other extreme are those students writing about the stock market . joining frats and sororities , sweating grades , and honking for Christ . Most of them are pleasant and terribly earnest . Maybe , I tell myself , this is just the transition generation , which will soothe public attitudes toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people will follow them , and shake up their elders all over again . Maybe that excitement , or at least some of it , will return . @#
