txt Letters to the Editor pg . 26 Letters to the Editor Of Italy 's Communists and Socialists To the Editor : The recent publication on The Times ' Op-Ed page of the article " Reds and Italy 's Future " by the Italian Communist leader G. Pajetta created , a sensation in Italy since it was reported as an important event and almost as an American endorsement of the Italian Communist party 's policy of the historical compromise . The Italian Social Democratic party can not ? on the eve ' of Italy 's June 15 general administrative elections  --  let this misrepresentation of the nature of Italian Communism go unanswered . The , Italian Social Democratic party is the reformist wing of.Italian socialism in the tradition of Matteotti ( murdered by the Fascists ) and- Saragat ; it takes part in the Socialist International ; it bases its policy upon freedom , social justice and economic reform , thus opposing the Communist system of dictatorship and state capitalism . The Italian Communist party has always sided with the Soviet Union . It recommends itself as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissent in 1968 over the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia , has returned to its pro-Soviet position . It re-adopted at its recent congress the dearest thesis of Soviet Communism : All that is good is in the Soviet camp ; all that is evil is in the other countries  --  a total approval of Soviet society , with its On Opting for Tragedy To the Editor : Richard de Combray 's letter June 3 seeks license to die " his way , " perhaps tragically and unnecessarily . May I intervene ? If we live in groups and develop Skills for mutual service , we must inevitably formulate standards . When we fly across the continent there is relative security in a system wherein the aircraft and its operators meet rigid qualifications . We have no inherent " right " to demand an untested plane or . . uncertain pilot , We command no options for tragedy . Laetril therapy for cancer has been exhaustively tested .

There will be no difficulty in providing numerous examples of drugs with extreme potentials for toxicity which can be purchased with impunity in many nations . Cancer is undisciplined cellular proliferation . Anarchy is a social aberration . Both are characterized by chaos . Both represent disease . Would Mr. de Combray have us deal with the former by substituting the latter ? SANFORD M. LEWIS , M.D. East Orange , N. J. , June 5 , 1975 ? The Fishermen 's Bill To the Editor : Angus Macbeth was employed by the Hudson River Fishermen 's Association to respond to Charles Luce of Con Edison . It is time for those of us who pay the bills to speak out . Mr. Macbeth 's letter to The Times ( June 3 ) would have us believe that flow-through use of Hudson River To the Editor : The recently reported decision ( June 6 ) by the State of New York to withhold the 8 per cent increase in Supplemental Security Income ( S.S.I. ) payments from the monthly checks of a half-million elderly , blind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Congress rightly voted to raise S.S.I. benefits to a point where they will begin to approach a " lower standard of living , " rather than their present subsistence level . For the Governor and the State Legislature to ignore Congress ' intention is not only fiscal foolishness , it is blatant disregard for the plight of our poorest citizens . The people who receive S.S.I. payments , who depend totally on them for the most elemental necessities of life , must not be made to bear the burden of balancing the state 's budget . Today , in New York City , an elderly , blind or disabled person receives a maximum monthly S.S.I. payment of $207 . With this sum , he or she must pay the rent , buy food and " enjoy " the " golden " years . Governor Carey came to office pledging to stake his reputation and his me= ord on his performance in the area of social services .

Raising the S.S.I. maximum benefit ( *wags , Its oppression and injustice . The Italian Social . Democratic party is an anti-Fascist party , and it stands for a , coherent policy of the left center ( with participation of the progressive Catholic and . the reformist socialist forces ) , with housing , educational , social-security and regional ( for southern Italy ) reforms , a task rendered difficult by the uncertain political directions of the Christian Democrats and by the Socialist party 's refusal to draw a demarcation line away from the Italian Communists . The Italian Social Democratic party has succeeded so far in preventing the historical compromise ( the alliance between Christian Democrats and Communists ) as well as any authoritarian turn to the right . . It works for economic and social progress in a united Europe allied to the United States . It condemns the Portuguese military leaders and Communists that betray democracy and generate problems ' for the defense and prosperity of the Mediterranean area . It rejects any type of violence .

PIETRO LONCO Vice Secretary Italian Social Democratic Party Rome , June 10 , 1975 water by Con Edison for cooling purposes would destroy a recreational industry of vast importance , and all for the sake of allowing Con Edison 's customers ( us ) to save a few cents on air-conditioning . What he is actually talking about is the desire of some fishermen to catch striped bass that may or may not have spent some time in the Hudson River . In the first place , are those fishermen so hooked on striped bass that they will fish ' for nothing else ? And how dependent are they on Hudson River fish ? Mr. Macbeth 's letter says " some , " which may refer to a very small percentage of all striped bass , although - the cost to - be paid by Con Edison 's customers would be as great as if there were likely to be a total loss of all the fish in the river : Moreover , his letter admits that the alleged 450,000 fishermen are spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , who will pay the bill for their pleasure , are all clustered in Con Edison 's area . The bill , he would have us believe , will be , small , only a few cents per month ( multiplied , no doubt , by an overhead factor ) , but after paying our share of Con Edison 's recent increases , few of us would willingly add one unnecessary cent for fun . At the end Mr. Macbeth . speaks pf the environment . Environment is mete than recreational facilities or even the quality of our water and air . It is the quality of our lives , and it includes opportunities to work as well as to play , to have an interesting life as well as a protected one . All of these things must be considered ; none should be excluded . The interests of 450,000 fishermen must be heard , but they must be heard in proper relationship to the interests of the nine million people who depend on Con Edison 's services . DONALD P. GILLETTE Hartsdale , N. Y. , June 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely not bankrupt the state financially , but refusal to do so will just as surely bankrupt it morally . We can not believe that the Governor and Legislature seriously Intend to balance their ledgers by , in effect , telling the poor to go hungry . The Community Council implores state officials to act on their pledge of concern and caring by reversing the twice-established precedent of failing to pass along a Congressionally mandated increase in the Federal portion of the S.S.I. payment . It is one thing to be hard-nosed and weed out unnecessary expenses in , the budget . No one argues with that approach . But it is quite another to turn benefits designed to help the poor into revenue-raising devices . We are confident that the Governor and the State Legislature will immediately act to insure that all S.S.I. recipients in New York State obtain the full increases in S.S.I. payments voted . by Congress . We are sure that New York will not now abandon its historic commitment to aiding the leastfortunate members of our society . We can not expect anything less from leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELINOR K. BERNHEIM BERNARD M. SHIFFMAN New York , . June 5 , 1975 The writers are , respectively , president and executive director , Community Council of Greater . New York . The City and Its Services To the Editor : History gives the lie direct to police unionists who are currently telling New Yorkers they should be terrified. - at the possibility of a reduction in the uniformed force estimated variously from 6,000 to 7,500 men . Even taking the higher figure , the Police Department would have 50 per cent more uniformed manpower than it had some fifteen or twenty years ago , when the population of New York City was greater . If quantity of police could possibly be related to public safety , we should be tranquil instead of becoming terrified . But , of course , there is not now any evidence , nor has there ever been , that bodies dressed in blue , bearing a badge ; nightstick and gun , can automatically increase public safety . To the contrary , the great growth in crime in New York City has been during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The figures show that New Yorkers , instead of yielding to scare tactics , should concentrate on demanding better management of police manpower and higher standards of acceptable performance of their duties . ALLEN WILL HARRIS New York , June 9 , 1975 An editorial on this subject appears today . To the Editor : ' One can appreciate Mayor Beame 's problems ' about deciding where the surgery on city services must be done in order to save money . It is'one thing , however , to cut fat and another . to perform a lobotomy . The Mayor evidently is ready to perform this on the Municipal Reference and Research Center , which has been the city 's memory . for many years . The sizable collection of books , reports and clippings about the city 's government and the city itself forms a unique source of information ? that is used daily by numerous New Yorkers and city employes for many different reasons . Much of this material is found . , nowhere else . Any researcher studying any aspect of the city , inchiding the genesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorely hampered , if not . impossible to do , by the elimination of this library , whose cost during . the present fiscal year was only some $235,000 . Citizens need more access to information about the city , not less . FRANK L. OINQUEMANI New York , June 7 , 1975 ? To the Editor : The city 's commitment to free tuition at C.U.N.Y. is an understandable one , even though in the present crisis it may be difficult to carry on . What is not commendable is the City University 's newly found commitment to graduate and professional education at $45 per credit when the cost to the city is between $90 and $100 : Last week the City University announced that it is instituting a law school which will . " not cost anything extra because the funds will be taken from unnecessary programs . " In the present crisis , the city could save untold millions of dollars by : . ? Raising graduate education to at least its cost . to the city . ? Eliminating expansion plans in the professional area , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budget Committee 's recommendation by adding one or two courses a week to - the teaching schedules , which seem to be extraordinarily light . If there are indeed unnecessary programs in the City University , they should be eliminated to help save free tuition. - OSCAR LONDON New York , June 4 , .1975 ? To the Editor : In reading the daily crisis reports on New York City 's financial problems , I believe a fertile field for both immediate and long-range savings is in the area of management of the city pension funds . Because the earnings rate is and has been . so low , the city 's pension contributions are , by necessity , so high . Recent comparable rates of re- . turn on long-term highest-quality securities are almost  --  double the city 's . The Controller and the Mayor ( former Controller ) should get their people working on raising pensionfund yield and thereby cutting . present pension service costs . An independdent , actuarial audit of the pension funds is needed . Constructive suggestions as to raising yield , eliminating bad investments , cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day . Municipal obligations do not belong in a pension fund . If fiduciaries charged with managing the pension funds are inept , root them out . Just compare the yield earned by a private company , such as an insurance company , and the city 's . Once the yield is up , the . city 's current contribution can be cut tremendously  --  perhaps in the hundreds of millions a year . JOSEPH R. EIDELBERG S-1r ? Oale , N. Y. , June 3 , 1975 S.S.I.
