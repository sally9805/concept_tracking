President Ford had been up most of the night supervising the sea evacuation of Americans from Beirut . His eyes were puffed and squinty . But there was genuine warmth last week when he strode onto a red-carpeted podium on the South Lawn of the White House and welcomed Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to the U.S. As the last strains of Waltzing Matilda faded away , Ford stressed how " particularly close " Australia is to the hearts of Americans . <P> Although the Prime Minister has been in office only seven months , the Ford Administration already considers Fraser , 46 , a rangy millionaire farmer , one of the U.S. 's best and most reliable friends in the Pacific . The U.S.-Australian relationship , while always close , has had its ups and downs in recent years , especially after Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam pulled Australian troops out of Viet Nam . After Eraser 's Liberal-National Country party coalition trounced the Laborites last December , the new P.M. immediately moved to bring Canberra more into line with American foreign policy . <P> Reversing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warships and also offered docking privileges at a new port being constructed near Perth in Western Australia . Since Australia 's own army and relatively small navy are insufficient to guard its 12,210-mile coastline or ensure control of supply lines across the Indian Ocean , Fraser has enthusiastically supported Washington 's opening up a new base on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean . <P> To show his willingness to continue the 1951 ANZUS Treaty , which commits Australia , New Zealand and the U.S. to counter regional threats with their own forces , Fraser has ordered a $15 billion increase in Australian defense spending over the next five years . But Fraser also wants the alliance with the U.S. redefined to take account of future Russian actions in the Indian and Pacific Oceans . Toward that end , he has proposed some sort of four-power Pacific cooperation embracing the U.S. , China , Japan and Australia-a form of local dtentein Asia . <P> Touchy Issue . Eraser 's talks with Ford , Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and other officials centered mainly on common defense interests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more beef from Down Under . Australia last year bought $2 billion worth of goods from the U.S. , which in return spent only $1 billion in Australia . The very size of the overseas economic presence in Australia , where U.S. firms account for 40% of the $14.6 billion total in foreign investments , is also becoming an irritant ; with Australian nationalism running strong , Fraser has set guidelines whereby U.S. and other foreign investors will be required to offer Australians the chance of obtaining a 50% share in new projects . Washington in turn has not been able to show the Australians much give on the touchy issue of high U.S. tariffs and import quotas . Shrugs one Administration official : " We have to say we just ca n't help that much . "
