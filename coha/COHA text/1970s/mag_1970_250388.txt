The island republic of Singapore recently proclaimed itself " a bastion of resistance to the social pollution of hippies . " Last week , after Singapore police arrested three long-haired youths from neighboring Malaysia , the young men were held in jail for 17 hours until they consented to being given short haircuts . A barber was duly fetched , and each of the young Malaysians was required to pay 330 to have his long locks trimmed . When the shorn youths returned home , their countrymen were outraged-and reacted accordingly . The Malaysian government delivered a stern protest note to Singapore 's ranking diplomatic representative in Kuala Lumpur . Malaysian students demonstrated outside the Singapore embassy and the Malaysian press deplored the incident . <P> Because of the uproar , Singapore 's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew hastily postponed his first visit in 19 months to Malaysia . " We tender our apologies for any inconvenience caused , " said Lee , who personally had ordered the anti-hippie campaign . " But it is not irreparable ; it will grow back in a matter of weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hair had made the young men less attractive to their girl friends , " we will send up wigs .
