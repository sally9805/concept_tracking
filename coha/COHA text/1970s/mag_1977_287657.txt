Well before last week 's visit to Seoul by Under Secretary of State Philip Habib and General George Brown , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Asian leaders were getting seriously worried about U.S. foreign policy in the Pacific . Time Inc . Corporate Editor Ralph Graves talked with several of them during a three-week visit to South Korea , Japan , Hong Kong , Singapore , Indonesia and the Philippines . His assessment of Asian attitudes : <P> The real business of Asia is now unmistakably business . Every country seems to be chasing after the Japanese economic miracle . Everybody is talking about growth rate , per capita income , foreign investment , development loans . Office skyscrapers and luxury hotels are blooming in Seoul , Manila , Jakarta and Singapore . Hong Kong is wall-to-wall skyline . It is all very heady and hopeful . <P> But two subjects that have little to do with economic development are preoccupying the leaders of Asia . Both issues have been raised by the Carter Administration , both are unpopular , and both cause deep concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from South Korea , and the abrupt new emphasis on human rights . <P> Two Pillars . South Korea 's Prime Minister Choi Kyu Hah , a genial bear of a man , calls the U.S. troops in Korea and Europe " two pillars of policy " that deter Russia from any adventures either eastward or westward . In his view , as long as both pillars stand , Russia must be cautious . If one is removed , Russia may feel free to behave differently . <P> Seoul , South Korea 's capital , does not seem beleaguered . Now a city of 7 million , it was 1.5 million in 1950 . Its streets are clogged by construction work . traffic jams and other symbols of its emerging prosperity . Traffic is so bad , in fact , that the government has taxed gas up to $1.65 per gal . and has put a 33% tax on new cars . Can a city with this kind of problem really be worried about military matters ? It can ; North Korea 's forces along the 38th parallel are only 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , but facing an extreme hazard . Every Korean leader seems to have a map in his mind and a geographic lecture on his lips : the country is the tip of a small peninsula at the edge of the Asian continent . It faces not only the intransigent opposition of North Korea on its only border , but beyond that the land mass of both China and Soviet Russia . At its back and sides , South Koreans repeatedly point out , there is only the sea . <P> In capital after capital , Asian leaders ask what will happen in the area when U.S. forces are gone . History bedevils them . Will the Japanese defense force become a real defense force at last ? Perhaps even a nuclear force ? One head of state-speaking very much off the record-suggests that by the 1980s there will be a new generation of Japanese leaders with no sense of war guilt and with none of the restraints that such guilt imposes . He does not care for this prospect one bit . Whatever happens , he predicts that the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
