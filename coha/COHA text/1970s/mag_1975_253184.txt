High-powered postal pitches for contributions are no new thing to American religion , but the Pallottine Fathers can claim a unique precedent . The 19th century Italian founder of their 2,140-member order , St. Vincent Pallotti , wrote countless letters to solicit contributions from benefactors throughout Europe for his work among the poor . Still , some U.S. Pallottines seem to have exceeded by far their founder 's epistolary zeal . Since November 1972 , records at the Baltimore Post Office show , the order 's fund-raising operation in that city has spent nearly $5 million on postage alone to mail to would-be contributors around the country a variety of elaborate baits , including a " Free Pallottine Sweepstakes , " featuring prizes such as automobiles and pool tables . <P> $54,000 Loan . Now the eastern U.S. province of the Pallottines that is responsible for the fund-raising operation is under intense scrutiny for financial wheeling and dealing that seems to be less than compatible with the order 's apostolic mission . The trouble began last month when it became known that a $54,000 loan from the Pallottines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have helped pay for Maryland Governor Marvin Mandel 's 1974 divorce settlement . Webster had lent exactly that amount to Mandel shortly before receiving the Pallottine loan . <P> The Webster connection does not end there . In 1974 , the Pallottines invested $280,000 in Amalgamated Modular Structures , Inc. , a portable classroom manufacturer headed by C. Dennis Webster that is involved in a Maryland school-construction scandal . <P> As a religious order , the Pallottines are exempt from laws requiring financial disclosures , and thus outsiders can only guess what their mailings have brought in . The Baltimore Sun cited estimates that the pitches may have yielded between $8 and $15 million last year alone ; the order sent little more than $400,000 to the Pallottine missions in Africa , Asia and Latin America . Pallottine headquarters in Rome dismisses the estimates as gross exaggerations , and in the U.S. the superior of the embattled province announced last week that there will be an outside audit of the operation . Even so , the ambitious fundraisers seem to have produced more ugly smoke than spiritual fire .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
