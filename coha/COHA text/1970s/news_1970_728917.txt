txt Joseph C. Swidler , the chairman of the State 's Public Service Commission , said today that the shortage of fuel was so serious in New York State that it might be necessary to resort to rationing for the first time since World War II . Mr. Swidler said he felt his agency would have the authority to ration oil , coal and natural gas supplies to electric power generating plants but not to individual homeowners . But , he said , homeowners would feel the impact of rationing through shortages of electricity that could lead to brownouts . He defined a brownout as " any situation where people can not use all the power they want to . " These situations could be as mild as voluntarily curtailing the use of electricity , but they could range up to voltage reduction and even selective cutting of all power for periods of time to certain areas and industries , he said . Brownouts in New York Such power reductions were used in New York City this summer to conserve electricity during periods of high demand brought on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part by reduced generating capacity because . of the breakdown of two generators . Mr. Swidler , who spoke at a news conference during a meeting here on the Beneficial Uses of Thermal Discharges , said that " with lucky breaks we could get through the winter " without any serious emergency . He said that among the " breaks " needed were : fliNo long rail strike that would tie up coal deliveries . fiNo worsening of the Middle // East situation that would block oil supplies . RA late freeze on the Great Lakes so that ships could have a longer season to bring in fuel supplies . g A relatively mild winter . He did not hold out the hope that all the breaks would occur . For example , he said , " A rail strike is more likely than not . " Mr. Swidler did not give any specific figures on fuel shortages or indicate the basis for his estimate of available supplies . Nor did he give any details of how a rationing program might work . Mr. Swidler said that the fuel shortage had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . " Notes Environmental Controls A major factor in making the fuel shortage serious , he said , has been the stringent controls put on fuel burning in the effort to protect the environment . These controls have led to natural gas 's being the most seriously short in supply as users have shifted to it because it causes the least air pollution . But prohibitions on the burning of anything but fuels with low sulphur content have led to shortages of fuel meeting these antipollution requirements . " The essence of the problem , " Mr. Swidler said ; is that " our usage of fuel increases and our supply diminishes . " He said there was no question that nuclear fuel would have to be developed to meet , energy needs as conventional ) fuels were depleted . Earlier this year the shortage of natural gas prompted three New Jersey utilities to restrict new large customers . The New Jersey Natural Gas Company said it had notified 100 projected new industrial plants and laboratories that it could not supply them with gas for heating , and similar action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey Gas Company . The meeting Mr. Swidler was at today was devoted to finding ways of using waste hot water that comes mainly from power plants and is becoming generally recognized as a threat to the environment . The water , heated when it is used to condense steam , can raise the temperature of lakes and rivers to the point where fish and plants die . The heat results from the energy loss in the process of converting fuel to electricity . Only about 30 per cent of the fuel energy is transformed into ' electricity ; the rest is waste heat . Because of the relative inefficiency of this process , Mr. Swidler said , further research might show that , faced with a serious fuel shortage , " We should use electricity . sparingly for safe heating . " Electric utilities have been promoting winter space-heating with electricity to balance off the extra generating capacity they have had to install to meet the peak summer demands for power to run air-conditioners . Mr. Swidler said that it might be necessary to keep using electricity for winter heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prohibitive capital investment if they were used only for a few months during the summer .
