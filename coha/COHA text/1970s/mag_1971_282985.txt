A QUESTION OF MADNESS by Zhores and Roy Medvedev . 223 pages . Knopf. $5.95 . <P> The Medvedev twins have punched some embarrassing small holes in their country 's bureaucracy . Zhores , a biochemist and sociologist of science , made influential enemies with his book The Rise and Fall of T.D . Lysenko ( Columbia University Press , 1969 ) . Drawing upon his personal experience as a devoted Marxist working within the Soviet scientific establishment , he fashioned a dispassionate piece of scholarship about Stalin 's quack biologist and agronomist , whose theories hobbled Russia 's economy for more than a generation . <P> Roy Medvedev , 46 , a historian of the humanities , takes a more sweeping view of the Soviet past . He also takes as many risks as his brother . Earlier this fall ( TIME , Nov. 1 ) , KGB agents searched Roy 's apartment and confiscated his bulky manuscript Let History Judge : The Origin and Consequences of Stalinism . But not before a copy had reached the West , where it will be published early next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zhores describes his 19 days of illegal confinement in a psychiatric clinic , and Roy tells of his successful publicity campaign to enlist the protests of some of Russia 's leading scientists and artists . <P> An aggressive interest in " mental health " is not new to Russia . Czars Alexander I and Nicholas I regularly branded as insane men who wrote and spoke out for individual liberties . Politically bent mental clinics have been operating widely in the U.S.S.R. since the early ' 20s . Today , compulsory outpatient care for persons who do not fit the official mold often includes heavy doses of tranquilizing drugs . The Soviets have no corner on abusive psychiatry , however . As Dr. Thomas Szasz pointed out in his book The Manufacture of Madness ( Harper &; Row , 1970 ) , unnecessary incarceration , forced therapy and denial of legal rights are common in the United States . The enormous difference , constitutional rights and traditions aside , is that in the Soviet Union punitive psychiatry appears to be an instrument of policy . With expedient blindness to the Hippocratic oath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has asserted that physicians " can have no secrets from the state . " <P> In Zhores Medvedev 's case , that directive was followed so literally that the precise nature of events-not to say Medvedev 's " malady " - was a secret from everybody but the state . In May 1970 , he was summoned to the Obninsk Psychiatric Clinic , not far from Moscow , under the pretext of attending a consultation about his son , a teenager with hippie tendencies . While waiting in a small room at a nurse 's request , Medvedev looked out of a window and saw his son leaving the hospital grounds . When he turned to go , Medvedev found the door of the room locked . He forced the spring with a pocket knife and sauntered out of the building . For the next few weeks , officials attempted unsuccessfully to wheedle him back to the clinic . At the end of May , a psychiatrist accompanied by police came to Medvedev 's home and muscled him off to the clinic for observation .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
