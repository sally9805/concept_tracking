txt In the heart of this southern Chinese city stands an artfully shaped pond , stone walking paths , and bridges arching across the water . One strolls along these causeways , admiring the strangely eroded mountain crags ringing Guilin ( Kwellin ) , rising " like blue jade hairpins " above the town , according to the poet Han Yu . Only one flaw intrudes on this classic Chinese scene : Hundreds of small fish float belly up in the blackened waters of the pond , killed by pollution . Over the last 20 years many factories have sprung up in Guilin , manufacturing everything from chemical fertilizers to tires to machinery ? all job-creating plants but fueled primarily by coal . For years to come China 's abundant coal seams will furnish the nation 's major source of power , as industrialization quickens . In the stoves of their small homes , too , Chinese burn soft coal cakes to ward off the cold , venting the smoke through stovepipes running out the windows . On a long journey down through China ? watching snow fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant spring rice in paddies of the south ? we visited a number of major cities // From page 1 China  - -  -  beauty polluted in the rush to modernize Everywhere the story was the same : China , though relatively early in the industrialization process , already is deep into pollution of air and inland waterways . Our first day in Guilin , where there had been no rain for some time , the air was an " assailing grit , " as my wife put it . Then came rain , cleansing the air somewhat , though it turned to black sludge the places on crowded streets where Chinese mix powdered coal with mud to make their heating cakes . In Shanghai , Chinese fishermen complain that already industrial pollution is harming their fishing grounds .

A debate now rages in Peking press over how much this lack Of vegetation worsens the scourge of periodic sandstorms , sweeping in from the deserts of Inner Mongolia . As we drove in from the Peking airport on arrival in China , our guide pointed proudly to rows of trees , planted in the late realization that Peking must have green belts to hold down the swirling dust . This spring Peking 's leadership hopes to plant half a million trees in the capital and its subburbs and to sow grass where soil now turns to dust and blows away . Control is expensive This campaign is nationwide , with young Chinese exhorted to do their bit to turn the country green , by planting millions of acres of trees by 1985 . While reforestation is essential , it does not strike centrally at the problem of industrial pollution , stemming from the widespread burning of coal and the discharge of wastes into streams , canals , and rivers . Chinese leaders speak frankly with Western businessmen about the dangers of pollution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cities . ? But pollution control is expensive , adding ? as the US has discovered ? to the cost of making products , without increasing output . Whether China , which in any event will go deeply into debt to finance its ambitious industrialization goals , will spend the extra cash to equip new plants with antipollution controls remains to be seen . Authorities are beginning to grapple with another kind of pollution , exemplified by the deafening clatter that assaulted our ears on a visit to a textile factory at Wuhan , on the Han and Yangtze rivers . Noise a problem " Damage to our workers ' hearing , " said Chao Yu-yi , vice-director of the plant , " is a serious problem , so we are going to provide newer equipment to reduce the noise .

" One nuisance common in American cities ? dog droppings on streets and lawns ? is nonexistent in China . Not until we reached southern China did we see a few dogs ? raised not as pets , but to eat . " A fine meal to serve one 's special friends on a cold winter day , " said our guide .
