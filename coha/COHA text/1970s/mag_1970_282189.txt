The sturdiest pulpits of Middle America stand in the 34,335 churches of the Southern Baptist Convention . The SBC 's 11,498,613 members , making up the largest U.S. Protestant denomination , are the fabric of the now somewhat frayed Bible Belt that arcs from California to Virginia . In folklore-and partly in fact-they stand as stern exponents of a Scripture understood in literal terms and a life lived by rough-hewn moral precepts . Last week the 13,500 " messengers " who gathered in Denver for the SBC 's 125th anniversary meeting* seemed to be running true to type . They filled the air with gospel singing and crowded onstage to deliver fervent " testimonies " before a background painted in Sunday-school pastels . <P> But in the words of outgoing SBC President W.A. Criswell , " termites " are gnawing at the group 's fundamentalist foundations . Recent years have seen a growing movement away from the old Bible-thumping toward a more liberal faith-particularly among some of the SBC 's seminary teachers and publications editors . The liberals have taken a progressive line not only on such issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation , finally joining scholars of other denominations in doubting that the text was inspired word-for-word by God and is thereby infallible . Last year Criswell , pastor of the 15,000-member First Baptist Church of Dallas , inadvertently brought these trends to a head by publishing a book titled Why I Preach That the Bible Is Literally True . The book enraged the Association of Baptist Professors of Religion , and in the ensuing furor Southern Baptists divided over whether to embrace or reject Criswell 's credo . <P> Playboy Debate . Any good Baptist regards the Bible as the ultimate authority , to be interpreted by each individual according to his own lights . Although the conservatives are by far the more numerous and vocal camp in the SBC , they can invoke no doctrinal discipline to block the liberals ' inroads . Last week 's meeting , instead of bringing the messengers together , only made their differences more glaring . <P> In one session , the conservatives yielded ten minutes of platform time to a dozen black collegians from Denver , one of whom shouted that the SBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raped black people . " " No ! " and " Lie ! " countered the audience . Later , the budget for the SBC 's social-action agency , the Christian life commission , went through with a 15% increase , despite conservative complaints about past ventures by the commission ( including an invitation to a Playboy spokesman last March to participate in a forum on the new morality ) . As the week wore on , however , grass-roots resentment built up steadily ; finally it exploded when the meeting took up Volume I of a projected twelve-volume Bible commentary published by the SBC 's Sunday-school board in Nashville .
