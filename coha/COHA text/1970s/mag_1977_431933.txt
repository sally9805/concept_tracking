 | Africa 's Gentle Giants @# THE SPEEDOMETER registered ten miles an hour , yet old George , just ambling along , easily kept up . Sitting at the wheel of the Land-Rover , I could hear the thud of his great hooves as he strode across the grassy plains of Kenya . A huge male giraffe , George accepted my presence without the slightest show of fear . I drove within six feet of him as he walked , swinging his immense legs forward , first the two on one side , and then the other two , in the typical pacing stride of the species . We were so close I could lean out the driver 's window , look straight up , and see one of the animal 's liquid brown eyes peering down . George , a favorite among the giraffes I was studying in East Africa , had given away his advanced age when his face popped up on a postcard . Riffling through cards in a stationery shop in Nairobi , Kenya , to find a giraffe picture to send home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was George ! Then on another card I identified a stately animal that I had been observing just the day before hardly five miles away . I noted the brown blotch slashed by taffy-colored streaks and the big , blurred capital " C. " The hair 403  | pattern of every giraffe is different , as unmistakable as a fingerprint . This one clearly was Miss Prim , an animal coded in my field notebooks as F47 . Searching further among the postcards , I came upon two more giraffe acquaintances . All were among the scores of giraffes I had been studying and photographing in Nairobi National Park , the 44-square-mile wildlife reserve just south of Kenya 's capital city . " I 'll take these four . We 've been living together for years , " I said to the clerk , who regarded me a bit oddly . I looked up the local photographer who had made the pictures ? some of them many years earlier ? and he told me when each had been taken . This allowed me to estimate minimum ages , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon I was looking at the giraffe pictures of all the local wildlife photographers . One showed an adult snapped nearly twenty years earlier that was another of my current study subjects ? and , like George , probably near the end of his life . There were pictures of other animals that had survived equally long . These " historic " photographs supplemented the camera record I 'd been making of every giraffe observed in Nairobi Park . Long-term , Long-neck Research On behalf of the Canadian Government , I had come to Kenya to set up a graduate program in wildlife ecology at the University of Nairobi. * I decided to study the giraffe , an animal that had obvious advantages as a research subject . The hundred or so animals in Nairobi Park at any one time were a manageable number , easy to find . Furthermore , they are just plain fascinating creatures . The giraffe is the world 's tallest animal ; a newborn calf may stand six feet in height and grow nine inches in a single week . Though awkward looking , the giraffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal a deadly kick with six-foot legs . But what makes the giraffe a standout among earth 's mammals is , of course , its long neck , holding its owner 's head 14 feet or more above ground . And , as I said , each neck is unique . The giraffe 's pattern ? its protective coloration of spots and lines ? does not change markedly with age on any part of its body , except sometimes to become darker . For my photographic record , this offered an obvious opportunity . A whole giraffe is an awful lot of animal , so it was easiest to picture just the neck . Arbitrarily I chose the left-side view . Eventually I compiled a catalog of 241 giraffe profiles , each " neckprint " mounted on a field-data card . Year by year my affection grew for these mild-mannered , knobby-horned prodigies of the African plains , with their soulful brown eyes . My family and I took a house in Nairobi , and from it I would set out down the @#  | Mombasa Road toward the park in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna , could accompany me , leaving the children snug in bed , watched over by their nursemaid . At the park 's first viewpoint , we would stop to survey the whistling-thornbush plains . Perhaps we would see a hartebeest push its way through the red oat grass , its horns festooned with spiderwebs strung with pearls of dew ; at times a yellow-throated longclaw would trill to a rival across a dry donga . " Trees " Begin Moving at Dawn One morning , seeing no signs of giraffe friends , we headed south toward the hippo pools . The sun touched the knuckles of the Ngong Hills and within minutes flooded the plains with slanting golden light . What had been vague shadows became wildebeests , zebras , reedbucks , warthogs , elands , hartebeests ? but still no giraffes . We dipped down toward the Athi River just as the sun reached the yellow-trunked fever trees . Vultures still roosted on the flat treetops , awaiting the thermals that would carry them aloft in quest of carrion . What had seemed to be a tree moved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd of giraffes , slowly ' idling along , nipping branch tips . We coasted down the hill and were soon among the herd . " Is n't that Mabel ? " my wife asked . It was . Mabel stopped ruminating to study us , then grasped a branch with her prehensile tongue . By the time we had identified ten old friends and photographed four newcomers , we suddenly discovered that we were cool no longer . The heat had become oppressive , and soon the giraffes and other game faded into the cooler thickets . As we pulled out , heading home for breakfast , a Masai herdsman stepped from the bush , seeking stray cows . The giraffes bolted , threading their way through the tangle of trees to the open plains . That was a safer place to keep watch on an old enemy . The giraffe has amazed civilized man for thousands of years . As early as 2500 B.C. , the animals were imported for display in zoos of Egypt , where the species was by then extinct . Julius Caesar introduced the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal a " camel leopard " because it was as big as a camel with spots like a leopard. @#  | The poet Horace called it a hybrid of the two This bit of unnatural history produced the giraffe 's modern scientific name , Giraffa camelopardalis . Romans hoped this strange beast would prove as fierce as it was huge , providing new thrills in the arena . They were disappointed . The elder Pliny described it as " more remarkable for appearance than for ferocity . " Though capable of uttering a variety of sounds , it seldom does , giving rise to a myth that it is mute . The giraffe also gives a deceptive impression of ungainliness ? but watch one in stride with its long , loping gallop and you see a paradigm of power , a kind of imperial grace . A big bull may weigh 3,000 pounds or more ; the cow , as much as 2,500 . But they can run as fast as 35 miles an hour , a speed matched by few other large animals . Elongated legs and neck lift the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same number of vertebrae as the necks of humans and most other mammals seven . The giraffe 's vertebrae , of course , have become greatly lengthened . My measurements established that the average cow giraffe stands about 14 feet tall , and the bull 15 to 17 feet . The record giraffe of trophy hunters , undoubtedly a male , measured 19 feet , 3 inches ? certainly an exceptional height . Its lofty bearing gives the giraffe the best view of any land mammal , helpful in spotting its principal threats , lions and men . Expanse of Hide Keeps Giant Cool A giraffe 's great surface area helps provide effective " air conditioning " in a hot environment . Other African mammals as heavy as or even heavier than the giraffe ? the rhinoceros , hippopotamus , and elephant for example ? slosh about in water or mud to cool their bodies . Each one needs to drink water at least every few days . No giraffe , on the other hand , has ever been seen bathing or wallowing , and the camel leopard seemingly can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its normal succulent food , such as acacia-twig tips , which are up to 74 percent water . Evolution has modified the giraffe 's anatomy to allow this stretched-version mammal to function ( page 404 ) . The lungs are oversize to compensate for the volume of dead air in the long trachea . Without this extra airpumping capacity a giraffe would breathe the same used air over and over . To drive blood eight feet up to the head , the heart is exceptionally large and thickmuscled , and the blood pressure ? twice or three times that of man ? is probably the highest in any animal . Unique Valves Check Surges of Blood Early observers wondered , seeing a giraffe lower its long neck to drink , why the blood rushing down to the head did n't cause a fatal hemorrhage . To withstand the surge of blood to and from the brain as its neck sweeps up and down , the giraffe has developed control valves in the jugular veins and a special network of blood vessels in its head . Known as the rete mirabile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffer keeps blood pressure constant in the brain . Such remarkable adaptations notwithstanding , giraffes have one vulnerability . I 've followed them running all out and have noted how quickly they tire . Their great size and heavy bone structure may put a limit on endurance . Feeding and chewing the cud occupy the giraffe for most of the day and night . Its favorite fare is. the tender , growing tips of the whistling-thorn acacia tree . A ton-anda-half bull probably consumes 75 pounds of this highly nutritious food every 24 hours . Giraffes are well adapted for reaching up , awkwardly built for reaching down . To feed on a bush , drink from a pool , or lick the salt in the dirt , they have to spread their front legs wide apart . Water holes are notorious hideouts for predators , and in their spraddled drinking position , giraffes are vulnerable . When a 300-pound lion fixes itself to the end of a giraffe 's six-foot neck , the victim is more than likely doomed to die by strangulation . Time and again , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giraffe . A herd of giraffes catching sight of a lion commonly crane their necks to keep it under surveillance , even walking toward the predator to get a better view . A lion hesitates to attack prey that is aware it is being stalked . Under direct threat of attack a giraffe generally beats a hasty retreat , although a female shepherding a small baby will stand  | her ground . Giraffes never employ their knobby horns against predators , but they can deliver a crushing blow with the hind foot , chop-kick with the forefoot like a horse , or strike with the whole stiff foreleg . Only once did a giraffe actually threaten me . I had just discovered her newborn baby , still soaking wet , and was examining the extraordinary placenta . My back was toward the cow , perhaps 60 feet away . Suddenly I heard crashing in the trees and looked around to see the mother charging toward me , slashing the air with her front hooves . I leaped for the Land-Rover , falling over a thornbush . By the time I scrambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peering down at me from about five yards away . She looked enormous , and very hostile . As I watched , her baby wandered over and began searching for the udder ? at the cow 's wrong end . The mother 's rage subsided , and the two ambled off . Baby Giraffes Suffer Fearful Toll Although predators take few adults , my records show that about three-quarters of the babies die in their first year , mostly in the first few months . Lions , leopards , cheetahs , crocodiles , and hyenas probably all take their toll , along with disease . Such natural cropping helps keep giraffe numbers from outstripping available food supply . But human poachers take an unnatural toll . Giraffe meat is quite tasty , and the animal 's thick , tough hide serves admirably in whips and tribesmen 's shields . Some East African peoples cherish giraffe tails as love fetishes and wear them as amulets . Tourists buy bracelets made from the tails . I noted that giraffes give birth anytime throughout the year , after a pregnancy of about 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captivity only two twin births have been recorded . Since the giraffe gives birth standing up , the young has to sustain a five-foot drop to the ground ( page 414 ) . Weighing close to 150 pounds at birth , the six-foot-tall youngster grows about four feet more the first year . I saw baby giraffes begin to nibble the tender tips of whistling thorn within a month of birth , rarely nursing thereafter . The bond with the mother is surprisingly loose , and a calf may wander off for days with neither showing alarm . Very young giraffes often gather in groups of as many as five , generally with one of the mothers as " sitter . " Adult giraffes tend to segregate by sex ? cows with cows and bulls with bulls ? and the commonest group unit I encountered was a pair of females . Overall I saw females far more frequently than males . The bulls , however , are less visible , as they more often forage in the denser woodlands . At about age 3 , males begin swinging their necks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages 416-17 ) . The combatants are rarely hurt , for the horns are blunt and the hide is tough and thick , but occasionally a skirmish grows into a furious battle . The fiercest bout I have seen occurred on the outer slope of Ngorongoro Crater . When we came upon them , two huge bulls had obviously been sparring for some time ? the ground was scuffed over a wide area . Our intrusion froze them for a minute . Then one bull slowly moved its head away  | and down . Suddenly it whipped up its head toward that of the other . The second giraffe saw the blow coming and arched its head and neck out of the way . As the blow passed , the second giraffe gave a quick bunt at the other 's neck , which was now under his . The necks became almost entwined , and the first giraffe had to heave mightily to free himself . Stirring up clouds of dust , the jousting went on for another ten minutes until one wilted and drew back . The winner pressed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we saw a lone giraffe wandering steadily over the plains , we could be sure it was a bull searching out the cow herds . Sighting a group of females , the bull would march over and determine whether any of them were ready for mating . If a cow was receptive , the bull might stay with the herd for several days . During this time any other adult male approaching the herd would be threatened by the bull in charge . Usually the new- comer would back away . Bull giraffes do n't defend particular territories but occupy certain areas as home ranges . Over the years , I learned that cows roamed over about 25 square miles , the bulls probably much more . I decided to install a radio transmitter on one animal and track its movement over a period of several weeks . More easily said than done ! With the support of the capture unit of the Kenyan Game Department and an electronics specialist from the University of Nairobi , I set forth with drugs and dart gun . Selecting a young female , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her rump . Ten minutes later the giraffe was reeling drunkenly , towing 12 of us at the end of a rope ! We managed to snub the lasso around a stump to stop her ? momentarily . As we watched , tension grew on the rope , and on our nerves . With a twang , the stump pulled loose , showering us with termites . Finally pection finds a four-mon riendly but independent . f p 416 a second loop around a hind leg brought the drowsy but determined cow to the ground . We made a note to increase the dose of tranquilizer next time . Many hands held up her neck so that food from her stomach would not find its way into her lungs . Quickly we fixed the transmitter collar around her neck , spray-painted her sides a bright pink , and injected the antidote to the drug . She roused , got to her feet , and walked off unsteadily . Next day we drove to the park 's highest hill and swept the horizon with our directional antenna . We caught a faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pink-flanked giraffe feeding with a pair of others in a valley two miles away . Completely recovered from the drug , she seemed oblivious of her new adornments . Keeping track of this young cow over a period of several weeks , we found to our surprise that she spent about half her time outside the park boundaries . Numbers in Precarious Balance Throughout East Africa , giraffe populations vary widely , depending on habitat and human pressure . In Nairobi Park the number of animals averaged out to 86 ? about two per square mile ? over the span of my threeyear study . I think that 's a fair figure for the density throughout the African gamelands , although on the Serengeti Plain only about 6,000 giraffes live in 5,000 square miles . Our study strengthened the evidence supporting extension of Nairobi Park to include part of the vast Athi-Kapiti Plains lying to the south , to which many of the game animals stray at will . Certainly the present park is near the limit both of its animal and humanvisitor capacity . Each year of study reinforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the African plains , Giraffa camelopardalis is the end result of many millions of years of evolution . Marvelously adapted to its environment , the giraffe is highly efficient as a converter of plants into protein . Its balanced birth and death rates help to ensure survival ; while giraffes possess powerful weapons of offense and defense , they rarely do damage to one another . One could wish that Homo sapiens might emulate these traits .
