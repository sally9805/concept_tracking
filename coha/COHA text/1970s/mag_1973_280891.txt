Rarely has the weather been so spectacular . And the White House fringed by the freshly planted chrysanthemums is a beautiful island of tranquillity in downtown Washington . <P> But many of the men and women who came out of the President 's news conference Friday night and walked through this scene carried with them a deep sense of despair . <P> They had witnessed a President who would not or could not answer questions fully , and they had seen reporters who could not or did not ask the right questions for a public that cries out more each day for some answers . <P> The East Room was like a bear pit with over 200 newsmen and women shrieking and roaring for attention , jostling each other as they leaped up and down signaling frantically for the President 's attention , ignoring the previous questions and the incomplete answers to press their own divergent points . <P> Any appearance of a President produces some enlightenment . But the frustrations were as great as the satisfaction , and in the end the session degenerated into a display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a people that already is in anguish . <P> Nixon gave a long answer about why he had fired Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox : because Cox had refused to obey his orders . But he said not one word about why he had then totally reversed himself and had given up the tapes just as Cox had urged . No questioner then got the floor to say , " Wait a minute , Mr. President , what logic explains producing a governmental convulsion of this magnitude and then announcing amid the carnage that you agree after all ? " <P> The President casually said in that same explanation that Elliot Richardson had approved of his " compromise " on the tapes that triggered all the trouble . At best that is a half-truth . A compromise is not a compromise without two parties agreeing , as Cox did not . Neither , in the end , did Richardson . <P> And what rationality explains giving up the tapes but clinging desperately to other documents on the basis of the theory of presidential confidentiality , which is already so shot full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new prosecutor the " independence " that he needed to bring the Watergate episode to a conclusion , but then his next statement denied that very independence . <P> Further , we now have an acting Attorney General who says he will go to court for the necessary documents to pursue the investigation and a President who says he is not about to allow that . Why is it that in this Government nobody seems to know what anybody else is doing or what they should be doing ? <P> Nixon called the stillborn confrontation with the Soviet Union early last Thursday the most serious episode since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 . The next day the Soviet Union said that was nonsense . What is it that prevents the President from giving the nation more details , details certainly known to the Russians ? A day earlier Secretary of State Henry Kissinger explained that the order to alert American troops came after long deliberation in a National Security Council meeting at 3 a.m . The President said that he had given the order shortly after midnight . A small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be told the complete story of these actions that jar their lives ?
