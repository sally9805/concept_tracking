The action moves very rapidly from Paul 's restaurant to Duplessis ' office to Kingdom Hall to an underground cell of Quebec 's Communist Party , and so on . None of these settings need be established in any kind of realistic way . The set should provide some sort of raised dais or speaker 's platform . ARMAND &amp; ISIDORE ( Sing ) In Canada , outside Quebec , you might not know his name But in all of North America , there 's no one quite the same As Maurice Duplessis , that 's Maurice Duplessis Vote Maurice ! We hear him on the radio , oh , fifty times a day You get so you can tell the very words he 's going to say That 's Maurice Duplessis , that 's Maurice Duplessis Vote Maurice !

Maurice makes his announcements Sunday morning every week So there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's Maurice Duplessis , Maurice Duplessis Vote Maurice ! ( As the song ends , ARMAND and ISIDORE have arrived at PAUL 's restaurant where a meeting of the Union Nationale Riding Association is going to take place . ARMAND is MAURICE 's sergeant-at-arms . ISIDORE is the President of the local Chamber of Commerce ) ( ARMAND looks something like a clown because he is rigged up like a one-man band . He takes off the apparatus and immediately looks much more forbidding ) p. 3 ARMAND &amp; ISIDORE And here he is , Maurice Duplessis , the Chief ! ( MAURICE enters . ARMAND attempts to lead the audience in three cheers and a tiger . The cheers should also be recorded on tape and the tape can sound artificial . ARMAND would very likely carry around a sound system to make sure MAURICE always sounded as if he were being followed around by 10,000 people ) ARMAND Hip Hip . . . ( Recorded cheers ) Hip Hip . . .

I wrote all the speeches . ARMAND Waiter ! He 'll have a glass of orange juice . We 'll all have orange juice . ( ARMAND plants a bottle of gin on the table ) GAGNON ( As CELINE enters ) That 's not a waiter . ARMAND That 's a waitress. p. 4 GAGNON It sure is . DUPLESSIS The kind of girl you do n't want to keep waiting . ARMAND Very funny , sir . ( ARMAND is something of a yes man . One of his responsibilities is to laugh at MAURICE 's jokes , or to make others laugh at them . ARMAND laughs and slops some gin in ISIDORE 's glass ) GAGNON You ca n't do that , Armand . You ca n't drink gin in this restaurant . It 's licensed for beer and wine . ARMAND Drink up ! ( ISIDORE does ) DUPLESSIS ( To CELINE ) You support the Union Nationale , mademoiselle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . Give her one of your buttons , Isidore . Pin it on her blouse . ( ISIDORE tries to pin a Fleur-de-Lis to one breast or the other with a locker room giggle ) CELINE Leave me alone , Isidore . GAGNON This is an honour , mademoiselle . This is the Fleur-de-Lis . . . that 's the emblem of Quebec . And this is the man who made the Fleur-de-Lis the emblem of Quebec . This is your Prime Minister , Maurice Duplessis. p. 5 DUPLESSIS And this is Isidore Gagnon . He 's the President of the Chamber of Commerce . CELINE I know Isidore . DUPLESSIS Shake my hand , Isidore . ARMAND You heard him . Shake his hand . GAGNON Well , sure , chief . Sure I will . DUPLESSIS Bring him right up here on the platform and I 'll shake his hand . He loves to shake my hand . Have a cigar , Isidore . GAGNON I do n't smoke . DUPLESSIS Here , smoke . I want to see something come out of your head . ( ISIDORE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell your grandchildren , Isidore . DUPLESSIS Go home , Isidore , make yourself some grandchildren and tell them about Maurice Duplessis ! GAGNON He 's really something , is n't he ? DUPLESSIS ( A speech . Songs and speeches may be miked ) Duplessis ! He speaks for you . For the Union Nationale ! GAGNON He 's the best . p. 6 DUPLESSIS The Union Nationale is the best . The Union Nationale in Quebec works for the Quebecois . Against foreignors . Against our enemies who believe in one language and one religion . We believe in our language . Our religion . The Catholic Church . . . ( He seems to speak directly to CELINE ) CELINE I am not a Catholic , monsieur . DUPLESSIS Are you not ? ARMAND She 's a Communist . CELINE There are no communists in Quebec . Monsieur Duplessis has kept Quebec quite safe from communists . Except in the North , of course . As everyone knows , the north of Quebec is populated entirely by communists , hiding in the bush with machine guns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't a communist . CELINE Thank you , Isidore . ( ISIDORE whispers to ARMAND who is horrified . ARMAND whispers to DUPLESSIS . He is trying to keep DUPLESSIS from CELINE as if CELINE had the plague ) DUPLESSIS I will have another glass of orange juice , mademoiselle . ARMAND Did you hear what I said , chief ? p. 7 DUPLESSIS Am I deaf , Armand ? ARMAND No , chief . GAGNON She 's a Jehovah 's Witness . ARMAND That 's what I said . GAGNON She does n't believe in blood transfusions . She does n't believe in going to war . She does n't believe in flags or national anthems or provincial governments . DUPLESSIS We know the Government of Quebec exists , do n't we , Isidore ? GAGNON Yes , sir . DUPLESSIS We do n't have to take it on faith . GAGNON No , sir . DUPLESSIS We will let mademoiselle bring us our orange juice and we will try to show her where she has gone wrong . Of course there is a government of Quebec , mademoiselle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , monsieur . We have no need for Governments . DUPLESSIS The government of Quebec keeps busy , however . CELINE I 'm sure you do . DUPLESSIS We have our economic policy . We develop the region of Ungava. p. 8 CELINE You sell it to the Americans . DUPLESSIS ( On mike again ) American capital buys jobs for the people of Quebec . The Union Nationale works for the Quebecois . . . Under this flag . . . ( Here , a spectacular unveiling of the Fleur-de-Lis , suddenly visible everywhere . MAURICE was probably saving this effect for the Riding Association but he wants to impress CELINE ) The Union Nationale gave you this flag . . . This is your flag . This flag for the Quebecois , not for English-speaking strangers . . . This flag wo n't go to Ottawa . . . GAGNON ( To CELINE ) Is n't that something ? The flags . The band playing . . . ARMAND That 's the way we planned it , Isidore . DUPLESSIS The Fleur-de-Lis . . . for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maurice , eh ? CELINE He 's a powerful speaker . ( MAURICE continues his speech , ARMAND understands that CELINE is a threat since she is n't cheering ) ARMAND What 's going on here ? Who said that ? CELINE I said he was a powerful speaker . p. 9 ARMAND I do n't like the way you said it . DUPLESSIS There are elements in our society , dedicated to breaking down our traditions , our culture . . . to abusive and insulting attacks on our religion . . . CELINE ( To ARMAND ) It 's because we 're working for God 's Kingdom . . . so we do n't salute flags . ARMAND ( Indicating the Fleur-de-Lis ) You salute this one . DUPLESSIS ( Still making his speech ) The Union Nationale will not tolerate a vicious campaign aimed at the Catholic Church . ARMAND ( To CELINE ) That means you . GAGNON It does ? ARMAND Of course it does . She 's a Jehovah 's Witness , is n't she ? ( PAUL has entered , a little concerned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meaning PAUL ) He does . PAUL I do . ARMAND You support the Union Nationale , monsieur ? p. 10 PAUL What 's going on here ? DUPLESSIS I will have another glass of orange juice , mademoiselle . GAGNON ( To CELINE ) I believe that everyone has the right to believe in what they believe in , but you 're wrong . . . CELINE You are misguided , Isidore . . . GAGNON And I did n't come here to hear about Christ 's Second Coming . CELINE You ignore the good news . . . PAUL ( Has been through CELINE 's attempted conversions before ) Get the orange juice , Celine . CELINE I 'm only trying to explain what I believe . PAUL Do n't explain . ( CELINE exits ) GAGNON ( To PAUL ) Is she going to stay for our meeting ? PAUL She works here . GAGNON I put a lot of work into this banquet . I 'm not going to stand around and watch it turn into a missionary hymn sing . She tried to convert me. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abusive and insulting attacks on our religion . ARMAND That 's right . GAGNON And we do n't have to listen to it . We do n't have to have our meeting at your restaurant . ARMAND Let 's get out of here . GAGNON That 's right . ( ARMAND and ISIDORE get rid of the bunting . MAURICE shakes PAUL 's hand very much the affable politician ) PAUL You ordered eighty dinners , Isidore . GAGNON Save them for the Second Coming . DUPLESSIS Help yourself and heaven will help you . Or help yourself and the Union Nationale will help you . Which comes to the same thing in the end . ( MAURICE , ARMAND and ISIDORE exit ) PAUL Celine ! ( CELINE enters ) CELINE You do n't need the orange juice ? PAUL Did you hear that ? CELINE I did n't try to convert him . PAUL I know you didn't. p. 12 CELINE Isidore Gagnon . It 's my duty to try and convert him , but I did n't . I 'm afraid of him , a little . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full course dinners sitting in our kitchen , Celine . Sometimes I wish your duty were not so clear to you . CELINE My trouble is , I do n't know how to start . When I get on the bus , I open the Bible and read it . That 's supposed to be helpful because sometimes people will read over your shoulder and you can engage them in conversation . . . But that does n't matter with you , because you already know I 'm a Jehovah 's Witness so I can go right on with the good news . PAUL Do n't bother . CELINE Do you ever wonder about life after death ? PAUL I wonder about life right now , Celine . CELINE What happens right now is n't important , is it ? Right now is over , is n't it ? PAUL No it is n't . Because you 're still trying to talk me into First Corinthians , Chapter Thirty-Five . CELINE There is n't any Chapter Thirty-Five . PAUL You believe in Christ 's Second Coming . Armand and Isidore believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind of his own . p. 13 CELINE You believe in this restaurant . You believe that thousands of tourists are going to come here to ski down mountains and eat . PAUL Yes I do . Why not ? As long as everyone who walks into this restaurant does n't walk out of this restaurant with you on his back trying to save his soul . I 've got a good chef . I 've got a liquor license . I 've got the best restaurant in town . CELINE That 's all you care about , business . PAUL And you care about other people . Of course . How you can convert them . . . what it will be like when they are dead . CELINE A lot of people take a lot of comfort from the thought of paradise . You talk a lot about the Union Nationale . PAUL Because I 'm concerned , Celine . CELINE You 're a pacifist who went to a Ban the Bomb demonstration to pick up girls . PAUL Who bails you out ? Every time you 're arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote for the Union Nationale . PAUL It 's corrupt , Celine . CELINE Why sell dinner to them ? p. 14 PAUL Because I run a restaurant . CELINE They did n't walk in here because they were hungry , Paul . They were going to have a campaign meeting . They had flags and banners all over . They were going to use your restaurant to help raise money to fix another election . PAUL The most important men in town were coming to that meeting . CELINE You would n't want to help the Union Nationale . . . PAUL Would n't I ? They 'll still have their meeting . They 'll go to another restaurant . CELINE And they 'll all get indigestion . So they 'll all vote Liberal . Even Isidore Gagnon . And you yourself , alone , single-handed , will have saved Quebec from four more years of graft . PAUL You are a raving fanatic , Celine . ( CELINE sings ) His restaurant runs at a profit He runs so he 'll stay in the lead A prophet who 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need He joined the Knights of Columbus He drinks pepsi cola and beer In 1955 he was the citizen of the year He says that he 's loving his country I say it 's all swagger and brag So fold up the blue and white bunting And tell them to take down the flag He joined the Knights of Columbus He drinks pepsi cola and beer In 1955 he was the citizen of the year . ( At the end of the song , CELINE is distributing pamphlets on a street corner . ARMAND and ISIDORE enter ) p. 15 ARMAND ( Taking a pamphlet ) What 's this ? GAGNON Some kind of trash . ARMAND ( Taking ISIDORE 's pamphlet ) Let me see that . ( MAURICE appears on the speaker 's platform . His speech seems to give ARMAND and ISIDORE the reinforcement they need for their fight to keep Quebec pure ) DUPLESSIS The Union Nationale will stop vicious and seditious campaigns against our people and our customs . We will work in Quebec for the Quebecois . ARMAND ( To ISIDORE ) See what this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARMAND ( Reading ) " The Catholic Church in Quebec . . . they teach burning hate . . . " ( ISIDORE grabs the tract he 's just crumpled up and reads it for the first time ) GAGNON Where does it say that ? DUPLESSIS We will not allow these people to annoy the citizens of Quebec in their homes or on the street , with seditious propaganda . p. 16 PAUL ( To CELINE ) Is that what your paper says ? Blah blah whatever , burning hate ? CELINE Yes . PAUL You wo n't blame them for taking it badly . GAGNON It says here I 'm a mindless mob . Tearing up God 's word . ARMAND I 'm tearing this up because it 's like Maurice says . . . GAGNON I 'm tearing this up because it 's like I said before . PAUL ( To CELINE ) You and Duplessis . You talk the same line . GAGNON I knew I did n't have to read it . I was right . PAUL ( To CELINE ) He believes in the Province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CELINE Quebec is not the Kingdom of God . PAUL We tell the American tourists it is . Maurice says it is . CELINE He 's a politician . He has an election to win . PAUL He 's a fanatic . So are you . ARMAND ( Taking more and more copies of the pamphlet ) I 'm tearing this up because it 's vicious . p. 17 GAGNON I 'm tearing this up because it 's seditious . ARMAND It 's trash . GAGNON It 's garbage . PAUL ( Picking up the pamphlets ) If it 's garbage , throw it someplace else . CELINE Stop it , Isidore . ARMAND This is war . GAGNON This is merciless war . CELINE Take one copy . Tear it up if you want to . Leave the rest . There are other people who might like to read it . ARMAND Maurice Duplessis for one . He likes to know what 's going on . GAGNON We 're working for Maurice . ARMAND There are ways to stop this kind of tramp from giving us this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumps forward to separate them ) PAUL Let her go . Leave her alone . ARMAND Cleaning up garbage . PAUL Cheap threats , Armand. p. 18 ARMAND We 're not threatening her . We 're telling her . ARMAND &amp; ISIDORE ( Sing ) You might wonder why a strong arm crew Sits at Duplessis ' right arm But next to God his goon squad Will keep Maurice from harm All police vote Maurice And they help us along When things get rough , we 're tough enough To say what 's right and wrong CHORUS Trained on the waterfront in Montreal Running bootleg alcohol When in trouble why not call On Maurice and his goons We 're seasoned with experience We got when running booze And like the fights election nights There are no fights we lose We are looking for sedition We will never stop our search For although we 're hoods , we 're also good Defenders of the Church CHORUS Trained on the waterfront in Montreal Running bootleg alcohol When in trouble why not call On Maurice and his goons ( At the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are in Duplessis ' office . Everything is peaceful . PAUL is making a protest ) p. 19 PAUL She 's a young girl with a bunch of badly written newspapers . You do n't have to send storm troopers after her . DUPLESSIS You exaggerate . You have a fine imagination . PAUL She has every right to her belief . DUPLESSIS And you 're determined . PAUL You have no right to persecute her . DUPLESSIS Where are you from ? PAUL What difference does that make ? DUPLESSIS I am from Trois Rivieres . There has been a town at Trois Rivieres for hundreds of years , am I right ? But follow the St. Maurice up the valley , the rest of the world might not be there at all . PAUL You 're good at finding corners where no one else has been . The St. Maurice , Ungava . . . DUPLESSIS Ungava , I guess is the hope of Quebec . PAUL Your friends are good at building roads in and taking all the trees out . DUPLESSIS I was young once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were young you said the Union Nationale stood for thrift and honesty in government . p. 20 DUPLESSIS Because I 've always loved Quebec . PAUL Why not keep a little of it ? DUPLESSIS I have no family . My only responsibility is the welfare of the Province . I belong to the Province . PAUL To the Province of Ontario or the State of New York ? ( MAURICE sings . It is an excessive hymn of praise sung unbelievably straight ) PAUL ( CONT 'D ) Do you know the country ? Have you seen Trois Rivieres ? The river waits for winter You can feel it in the air I can see the future I could see the future It was waiting there Do you know the country ? Have you seen Trois Rivieres ? Do you know Ungava ? Have you seen her skies at night ? The wind blows cold across the moon Until the sky is bright I can see the future In that northern light Do you know Ungava ? Have you seen her skies at night ? ( The song begs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not impressed ) p. 21 PAUL You sing that on the Ed Sullivan show .

( MAURICE is affable , politic , impossible to offend ) PAUL About the girl . . . DUPLESSIS Are you in love with this girl ? PAUL She works for me . When she is n't working she stands on the corner and pretends she 's a missionary . I do n't know . DUPLESSIS She gives out pamphlets . PAUL She is n't very good at it . DUPLESSIS She uses free speech to offend people . PAUL She wo n't lie , Celine . She says what she believes . DUPLESSIS She is indiscreet . PAUL What 's wrong with that ? DUPLESSIS This pamphlet is called " Quebec 's Burning Hate " . PAUL It is badly written . It 's an unfortunate phrase . DUPLESSIS It is hate literature . p. 22 PAUL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inflammatory . PAUL She 's very young . She 's completely harmless . DUPLESSIS You like to talk about girls . How harmless . How naive . I like to take about politics . PAUL Your strong arm gang hustled her up against a wall . . . is that politics ? DUPLESSIS There was an assault ? Did they hit her ? Who hit her ? ( ARMAND and ISIDORE come running . The chief wants something . They are ready to obey ) PAUL I do n't know . It got confusing . They threatened her . ARMAND I did n't threaten her . DUPLESSIS What was said ? What happened ? Really ? GAGNON He told her he found her newspaper in poor taste . PAUL He tore the papers up . ARMAND She gave them to me . I tore them up . DUPLESSIS It seems that nothing happened . It seems that two Quebecois destroyed material of no commercial value because it seemed to them offensive . I find this material offensive . It is an insulting attack on church and social custom . I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . My men do not employ violence , of course . p. 23 PAUL They hustle her up against the wall .

DUPLESSIS We have been watching these people for some time . . . PAUL Sure you have . You probably noticed them sneaking around up North . In the bush with the communists . DUPLESSIS They are a seditious criminal conspiracy . PAUL Who ? Communists or little girls ? DUPLESSIS ( He exits ) We have a great deal more information about these people than you can possibly know . PAUL Celine and the Witnesses . It sounds like a rock group . ( It is . CELINE sings .

( At the end of the song , we are at Kingdom Hall ) p. 24 CELINE Thanks for bailing me out , Paul . PAUL I 'm used to it . CELINE Did you come to hear the good news ? PAUL You look like you could use an audience . CELINE It 's early yet . PAUL It 's eight o'clock . CELINE We have a very small congregation . PAUL Yes . Of course . CELINE Maybe I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . Except that I do n't speak in public . PAUL ( Ironic ) Pretend it 's just me , Celine . CELINE I heard Duplessis today . On the radio . He 's a wonderful speaker . I do n't know why you say he 's corrupt . After all , the whole world is corrupt and he was talking about his father . His father is dead , Paul . I do n't believe in the political process , of course , but his speech was very moving . . . he made me cry . PAUL I 've heard the speech . He makes it every year . Because it makes people cry . CELINE You 're very cynical . p. 25 PAUL You want to believe that , you go right ahead . CELINE I suppose you think I 'm not sincere , either . . . PAUL I think you 're loony . CELINE You have no human sentiments at all . PAUL Did Duplessis tell you about the miners at Asbestos ? CELINE About his father . I told you . PAUL He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provincial police to Asbestos . . . to break a strike . His police start a civil war and you cry about Duplessis ' father . CELINE Well , I do n't know about Asbestos . PAUL Well , find out . Before you talk about my sentiments . CELINE If I believe in something , I do something about it . PAUL I 'm a pacifist , Celine . CELINE Do pacifists sit around and complain all the time ? PAUL Am I supposed to hire a goon squad ? If I want to get rid of Duplessis , do I have to act like Duplessis ? CELINE I do n't know .

PAUL Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awkward beginning ) Some people think religion and nationalism are the same thing . . . ( ISIDORE and ARMAND produce a lot of flags and bunting which they begin to drape over CELINE 's speakers platform ) GAGNON The trouble with a Kingdom Hall , it 's full of Jehovah 's Witnesses . ARMAND Do n't pay any attention . Remember our meeting . Remember the parts where I told you to cheer . ( CELINE has never had a chance to preach before because women are not allowed to preach to men . Subservience has never come easy to CELINE . She is beginning to enjoy herself . She makes the kind of gestures beginning public speakers might practice in front of a mirror ) p. 27 CELINE . . . People say : God made our country . God is on our side . GAGNON Maurice says : The Union Nationale in Quebec works for the Quebecois . . . then I cheer . . . Yeahhh !

GAGNON Then I say Yeahhh and you slip me five dollars . . . CELINE But God made all of the countries and men made the borders which divide his kingdom . ARMAND You know what you need for a political rally ? Bands . Marching . Close order drill . Balloons . Streamers . White doves . Fireworks . ( As much of this as possible appears . A lot of flags . ISIDORE snaps to attention and an attitude of mindless respect . ARMAND encourages him ) ARMAND There should be a song , Isidore . To go with the flag . What 's the song ? p. 28 CELINE ( Sings ) God has given us the answers Watch and listen for the sign We can live on earth forever Watch and listen for the sign I can tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listen for the promise God has given me a sign . ARMAND Do you know Melancholy Baby ? CELINE Excuse me , this is Kingdom Hall . GAGNON And we 're having a meeting here . And I 'm saluting the flag . CELINE We do n't salute flags . GAGNON Of course we do . CELINE Flags are signs of man 's kingdom . GAGNON That 's right . CELINE You do n't understand what I mean . GAGNON This is a public meeting . I am a member of the public . You are interrupting my respect for this flag . CELINE Kingdom Hall is our meeting place . GAGNON Your meeting place . Our meeting . Ask Armand. p. 29 ARMAND What we need is press coverage . Banner headlines . ( PAUL begins to take down the flags ) PAUL The Union Nationale does n't meet in Kingdom Hall . GAGNON Says who ? ARMAND Maybe you should leave that flag alone .

( ISIDORE throws a punch at PAUL . ARMAND , with a huge press camera , begins to take pictures of the action , very enthusiastically ) ARMAND Beautiful . That 's fine . Now if you could turn your chin a little this way . Cheek toward me . That 's it . Black . Blue . Blood . . . Hold him up against the wall there for a minute , let me get in closer . Wait a minute , hold it , Isidore . . . It 's the chief . . . Hey Maurice ! This way . ( MAURICE enters , courted by ARMAND 's camera ) Beautiful . Prime Minister stops brawl single-handed . That 's wonderful , sir . Maybe a shot with your arm around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shot with the flag in the background ? ( PAUL has been knocked down in the tussle . Before he can get to his feet , ARMAND pushes him back to the floor to set him up for one last picture ) p. 30 ARMAND Wait a minute . One more . That 's it . These pictures are going to be just fine . PAUL ( Groggy ) What pictures ? ARMAND We can make the weekend colour magazines with pictures like these . It 's a terrific story . PAUL What story ? ARMAND If I had one more action shot . . . CELINE The action is over . ARMAND Maybe you could just lie there . ( He takes one last picture of PAUL prone on the floor ) Want to tell me what happened ? PAUL There was supposed to be a religious meeting . My friend was speaking . CELINE Isidore Gagnon beat him up . You saw him . You were taking pictures of it . ARMAND You the one speaking ? CELINE Yes . ARMAND Who was it you were speaking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were some goons from the Union Nationale . They brought in flags . p. 31 ARMAND What flags ? ( MARUICE and ISIDORE have taken possession of the flags ) PAUL The new flag . The Fleur-de-Lis . Someone started singing . . . someone started yelling . . . ARMAND ( To CELINE ) You were speaking at a Union Nationale meeting ? Want to turn just a little toward me , mademoiselle . Give us a little leg and a big smile . ( He takes another photograph ) PAUL One of the goons threw a punch at me . You are n't writing this down . ARMAND You look terrible . What does the other guy look like . PAUL If you want the story , why do n't you write it down ? ARMAND Where are all these guys he says beat him up ? PAUL There was one other guy . ARMAND A squad of goons. . . one little guy wearing glasses . I do n't care . Where is he ? PAUL Do you want my story or do n't you ? ARMAND Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . it 's a great story . PAUL Then write it down . p. 32 ARMAND I ca n't print it , that 's all . PAUL Why not ? DUPLESSIS I do n't see a gang of hoods . I do n't see any flags . I do n't see a Union Nationale meeting . You imagine things . Union Nationale lawyers could probably prove that in court . ( ISIDORE turns around . He has a very visible black eye , a work of art which MAURICE has helped him apply ) GAGNON I would like to lay a charge of common assault . DUPLESSIS When in trouble , go to the top . And I 'm the top . ( ARMAND takes a photograph . ISIDORE poses co-operatively ) ARMAND That 's great . Turn a little toward me , sir . And look at the Prime Minister . As if you were talking to him . DUPLESSIS I am also the Attorney General , so I 'm very interested in law and order . ARMAND Maybe we could talk over here in the light ? DUPLESSIS Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has no personal axe to grind . He has no desire for publicity but he knows his civic duty . . . there are certain organizations operating in our society , against our society . . . p. 33 ARMAND ( To PAUL ) Is this the guy you beat up ? PAUL That 's Isidore Gagnon . He punched me . ARMAND He punched your fist with his eye . PAUL Tell them what happened , Isidore . GAGNON I 'm an ordinary kind of guy . I 'm a very human kind of person . I like flowers . I like band music and parades . I like flags waving in the breeze . DUPLESSIS Mr. Gagnon is upset by his experience . ARMAND ( To DUPLESSIS ) So these religious nuts walked up to him and started roughing him up . PAUL I 'm no religious nut and he punched me . DUPLESSIS This was not a disagreement in theology . PAUL No , it was n't . DUPLESSIS This incident was provoked for political ends . PAUL Yes , it was . Isidore provoked it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goon squad ? What does he mean by that .
