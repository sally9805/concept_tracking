Mohammed Javad Bahonar , 46 , an Islamic scholar who has been a leading figure on Iran 's 15-man Revolutionary Council for the past year , sat with his legs crossed on the floor of his small apartment in Tehran and offered a partisan assessment of the current crisis : His fervent arguments illustrate the gulf between the Iranian version of the conflict and the view of it held by the outside world . As he talked with TIME 's Bruce van Voorst , Bahonar fingered his horn-rimmed glasses like modern worry beads : <P> Q. Is n't the reaction in Iran to the Shah 's presence in the U.S. out of all proportion to reality ? <P> A. The United States insulted the Iranian national honor and the Islamic revolution by giving the deposed Shah a visa . The ex-dictator represents all the pain , torture , humiliation , deprivation and repression suffered for decades by our nation . And just at a time when Iranians believed Washington at least tacitly recognized this fact , the ex-tyrant triumphantly enters New York-a malicious , outrageous , insupportable insult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liberation . <P> By gross miscalculation or cynical design , you trigger a new revolution , and then you hide behind your customary legal nitpicking . You activated the volcano and now you expect us to help you out . We ca n't , unless you put right the insulting mistake you have made . <P> Q. But why all this emphasis on sending back to Iran for trial a dying old man who has tubes draining out his insides ? <P> A. The people want the ex-Shah publicly tried because they want to prove to the whole world once and for all what a heinous criminal he was . It is the principle , not the man , that matters . <P> For you it is easy to say that the Iranians need a scapegoat and the regime wants to muster patriotic support . You are wrong through and through . What this nation has suffered at the hands of the Shah is no less serious than what the Jews suffered at the hands of the Nazis . <P> Then , when our turn comes , your measuring stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons supplied by you and under the supervision of your military advisers , hundreds of innocent women , children and men were being mowed down every day . Now , you expect us not only to give up our quest for justice but even sacrifice our honor.No deal , sir . <P> Q. But are you prepared to violate international law to achieve your objectives ? <P> A. Your insistence on the legalistic aspects of the embassy siege is specious . The Revolutionary Council did not do it . You deserve the credit for unleashing this rebellion . Do n't talk to me about whether the siege is right or wrong . Talk to the very people you have provoked into this hysteria . You think you can get away with murder by hiding behind the law . The Islamic canon recognizes the right of an oppressed people , faced by a government that cites the law in order to betray justice , to rebellion . The Iranian people 's occupation of the U.S. embassy falls squarely within this principle . <P> Q. It is likely that the President could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
