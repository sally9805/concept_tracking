UPTOWN SATURDAY NIGHT <P> Directed by SIDNEY POITIER <P> Screenplay by RICHARD WESLEY <P> What a wonderful title - raffish , with a street-smart tone , and with the promise , too , of a gaudy carnival running full tilt dusk to dawn . Uptown Saturday Night could have been , should have been , a neon mosaic of high spirits and lowlife . <P> The first hint that something rather different is going to be delivered here comes at the very opening , when Sidney Poitier , serving as both star and director , gets off his factory job and steps into some dog dirt .

The friends arrange to meet at Madam Zenobia 's after their wives have gone to bed . They show up , eye the girls , but are robbed , along with everyone else , when four masked men hit the place . The rest of the movie deals with the contortive lengths Cosby and Poitier go to to retrieve Poitier 's wallet , which contains , as it turns out , a winning raffle ticket . <P> The cast is laden with all sorts of luminaries ( Harry Belafonte , Calvin Lockhart , Richard Pryor , Rosalind Cash ) and among them there are a couple of nice but wide comic turns : Roscoe Lee Browne as an enjoyably fulsome and hypocritical politician , and Flip Wilson as a preacher who exhorts his congregation , " We need more romance and less hot pants . " Cosby is affably anxious , but Poitier 's idea of comic acting is to bulge his eyes out , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some movies that they look like photographed stage plays . Uptown Saturday Night looks like a photographed radio show .
