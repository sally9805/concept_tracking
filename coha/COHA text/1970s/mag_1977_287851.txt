LONELY VIGIL : COASTWATCHERS OF THE SOLOMONS by WALTER LORD 322 pages . Viking . $12.50 . <P> <P> Walter Lord has told his readers what it was like to go down with the Titanic ( A Night to Remember ) , to fight at the Alamo ( A Time to Stand ) and to wake to the World War II overture one Honolulu morning in 1941 ( Day of Infamy ) . As a popular chronicler of historic days and nights , the bestselling author relies heavily on eyewitness accounts from participants and survivors . Incredible Victory , his narrative of the Battle of Midway , crackled with aging voices from both sides . For Lonely Vigil : Coastwatchers of the Solomons , the author traveled 40,000 miles ( including a rugged three-day bivouac on Guadalcanal ) to assemble this story of the men and women who flashed reports of Japanese ship and plane movements and rescued more than 100 downed pilots . A number of foundering sailors also owe their lives to the coastwatchers . One was a 26-year-old lieutenant ( j.g. ) named John Fitzgerald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hull of a Japanese destroyer . <P> The saga of coastwatching has been swamped by the gross tonnage of war books launched in the past 30 years . Yet , as Lord describes it , vital Pacific island victories were won with the eyes and ears of clandestine observers : ex-planters , Micronesian guides , Australian mavericks , priests and nuns , who provided intelligence essential to understanding the enemy 's battle plans . <P> The Japanese were resourceful warriors . On the island of New Georgia , they cleared palm trees for an airstrip but left the tops suspended on wires . Beneath this camouflage , the field was completed before U.S. reconnaissance photos could detect the ruse . In 1941-42 the Japanese had island-hopping plans of their own . From their major base at Rabaul , just off New Guinea , they moved to Buka and Bougainville-the most northerly of the Solomons . From there , they established bases southward on other islands , including Guadalcanal . <P> The U.S. naval victory at Midway Island stopped the Japanese tide in the Pacific and enabled Americans to take the initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unopposed on Guadalcanal and captured a vital airstrip that was renamed Henderson Field , after a pilot killed at Midway . Already ashore for many months were teams of coast-watchers who had taken to the wild highlands , where they played hide-and-seek with Japanese patrols and relayed information about enemy installations . <P> Changing Fortunes . As the unlikely spies demonstrated , fortunes of the Pacific war could change as quickly as the tropical weather . A daring Japanese sea attack at Savo Island gave the U.S. Navy one of the worst beatings in its history and left Marines on Guadalcanal stripped of support . A year later , the island and its airstrip were dramatically saved-a rescue made famous by Richard Tregaskis in his book Guadalcanal Diary ( 1943 ) and by Lloyd Nolan , William Bendix , Anthony Quinn , et al. , in the movie version .
