Determined to Persevere Sadat wins U.S. support ; Dayan follows with a challenge <P> It was like a game . Just as Egypt 's President Anwar Sadat was completing his series of Washington appearances , Israel 's Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan arrived in the U.S. for his own meetings . Each wanted the U.S. to exert pressure on the other . <P> Sadat had arrived in Washington feeling and looking glum about the fate of the peace initiative that he had begun with his historic visit to Jerusalem last November . " Carter found Sadat discouraged and demoralized over the slowness of progress , " said one high Administration official . " Sadat 's feelings seemed genuine and deep . " At secluded Camp David , President Carter worked hard to " energize " Sadat , recalled one aide , reminding him that setbacks were inevitable and assuring him of U.S. support . Carter was effusive in his praise , even calling the Egyptian " the world 's foremost peacemaker . " <P> Sadat , TIME has learned , made a six-point proposal for meeting Israel 's security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan envisioned some Israeli military strongpoints remaining on the West Bank following a general troop withdrawal . It also called for U.N . military control of the strategic site of Sharm el Sheikh , and stationing of almost all Egyptians in the Sinai to the west of the strategic Mitla and Giddi passes , with a U.N . force east of the passes and creation of a large " buffer zone . " <P> Although Sadat was willing to agree to something less than an independent Palestinian state , he insisted that the possibility of such a state existing in the future could not be ruled out . He linked Egypt 's offer to sign a full peace settlement to Israeli treaties with Syria and Jordan , which have refused to join the negotiations ; these two points , as well as the proposed reliance on U.N . forces , may not meet easy acceptance within Israel , but the proposal did lead one U.S. Senator who is normally pro-Israel to remark : " If I were Begin , I 'd sign an agreement tomorrow based on these guarantees . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became obvious that Sadat was even more frustrated than had been expected about what he considered the hardening of the Israeli position-particularly Israel 's continued insistence on the right to settlements in territories captured from the Arabs in the 1967 war . Before leaving Camp David , Sadat shocked Carter and his aides with the announcement that on the next day , in a speech at Washington 's National Press Club , he planned to say publicly that Egypt did not intend for the present to return to any meetings of the Israeli-Egyptian Political Committee , which he had broken off last month . Worried U.S. officials delayed Sadat 's departure from Camp David by an hour , while they argued that such an announcement would bring to a halt whatever peace momentum remained .
