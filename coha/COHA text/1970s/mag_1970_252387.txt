Sandwiched between a dilapidated Irish pub and a skin-flick cinema in midtown Manhattan , the black door with its heavy brass plate proclaims " Scanlan 's Literary House . " Upstairs , in a garish former banquet hall , the scene is even more bizarre : a dozen cluttered desks and typewriters , one freelance writer demanding payment , a payrolled private investigator deep in conversation with an ex-con contributing editor . At center stage , ex-Ramparts Editor and Raconteur Warren Hinckle III and former New York Times Reporter Sidney Zion celebrate their unlikely accomplishment : Seaman 's Monthly is born. * <P> " We did everything we were n't supposed to , " chuckles Hinckle . " No marketing studies . No direct-mail campaigns . No promotion . No ads . We did n't I even do a dry-run issue . " " Yeah , " says Zion , " we wanted game conditions .

There is a thoughtful history of Biafra , a long biography of Gangster Mickey Cohen by the late Ben Hecht , even a serialized comic strip . " The first number was supposed to be 80 pages , " says Zion , " but we went up to 136 because we just did n't want to kill the stuff . " <P> Or edit it either .

More persuasively , a Viet Nam veteran recounts several killings that grimly resemble My Lai . Brutality of another kind is the subject of a strong article on the " Woodstock West " folk concert held last December at Altamont race track in California . Why , Scanlan 's wonders , was there not more attention paid to the fact that four people died , 700 were treated for bad acid trips , and that the Hell 's Angels motorcycle gang , hired by the Rolling Stones rock group for " security , " rampaged with pool cues , killing an 18-year-old black ? <P> Family of Flies . In a lighter mood , Scanlan 's accompanies a health inspector on a kitchen tour of Manhattan restaurants . Next to stars awarded by New York Times Gourmet Craig Claiborne , Scanlan 's gives its own uncleanliness symbols : garbage cans .
