THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ASINGLE newscast brought the American people both their first glimpse of Alexander Solzhenitsyn in the West  --  he was holding a bouquet of daffodils at the Frankfurt airport to present to his German host -- and Secretary of State Kissinger 's reacdon to Solzhenitsyn 's arrival . The careers of the two men  --  the one having risen to the pinnacle of power in his country , the other having descended to the bottom level of the powerless in his country  --  are closely linked . Their careers are bound up with an evolution that each man has acknowledged in his own way and that now appears to be irreversible : the fusion of the globe into one boundary-less field of human action . Solzhenitsyn 's presence among us  --  the people of the West  --  proclaims the moral unity of the earth . The whole course of his life as well as his present circumstances confirms what he put into words a while back : " There are no internal affairs left on our crowded earth ! And mankind 's sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of the East being vitally concerned with what is thought in the West , the people of the West vitally concerned with what goes on in the East . " All of us , he said , must give our attention to any " muffled zone " on the earth where state violence , which sometimes appears " saintly , kind , and very peaceful , almost drowsy , " may be doing as much damage to the species as the more " stormy " and " vivid " violence of war . Solzhenitsyn  --  who has what it takes to remain a free man in any zone turns nut , now that we can see him on our television screens , to be an unexpectedly ebullient man . He has a smile of pure joy , which was not hinted at in the photographs of him that we used to be shown . And , having thought of him as an immobile , granite figure , we are surprised to sec how lively and nimble he is . " I have so many impressions ! " he exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he delivered a sharp reprimand to the Western press for inaccuracies it had published about him . The man who fought for his rights in the Soviet Union appears to have no inclination to give them up now that he is outside it . Everywhere he goes , people cluster around him , and sometimes they break into spontaneous applause . To us in the West , who have known him only from the solemn photographs and from his grave art , he seems to have the air , somehow , in spite of his recent trihula dons , of one newly horn . Secretary of State Kissinger 's career proclaims the approaching political and economic unity of the globe . He , too , has been a leveller of national barriers , but the barriers he has breached have been between governments rather than between peoples . At his press conference , when he was asked about the exile of Solzhenitsyn he took evasive action . He began to speak in political code language . ( From the White House , there had been a " No comment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very little evidence lately that " the Administration 's regard for human rights ... is clear . " ) He retreated into generalities . " The United States has always looked with sympathy , with great appreciation , at the expression of freedom of thought in all societies , " he said . He took refuge in ignorance . " We do not know enough about the specific circumstances of the departure of Mr. Solzhenitsyn , " he said . Bystanders in Europe were breaking into applause at the sight of the new world hero , but the American Secretary of State was mute , was still waiting to find out what had happened . He alluded to what it was that commanded his silence . It was no light matter . It was , of course , detente  --  that is , it was " the unacceptability of general nuclear war under present conditions . " For good measure , he added , " The accumulation of nuclear arms has to be constrained if mankind is not to destroy itself . " By his calculations , the survival of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Soviet Union 's internal affairs . Fm Solzhenitsyn , there were no internal affairs on the earth . For Secretary Kissinger , everything but detente was an internal affair . Solzhenitsyn was working for the moral and intellectual fusion of the globe at the level of the individual . Kissinger was working for the economic and political fusion of the globe at the level of governments . Secretary Kissinger 's performance appeared to suggest that we had to choose between one kind of unity and the other . At the same time , with his veiled answers , he appeared to be hinting and signalling to AL ' 17:7711r , - - us from within the moral captivity of detente that he , too , was moved by the great writer 's quest . No doubt he has such feelings , but we may never know exactly what they are . He seems to have entered a muffled zone . New House OUR friend Henry Korman , architect , is building a house near Riverhead , on Long Island , and he invited us to drive out there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he picked us up at about ten to seven , and we got to Riverhead about eight-thirty . The morning star was Venus , and there was an incredible sunrise , full of green , orange , and purple . We napped on the way , waking up only in Patchogue , and thought about nothing at all . Henry thought about the sunrise , he told us at breakfast , and about whether he could light a cigarette with one hand , and about whether his toes would freeze when he got to the house . The house is on the Sound , on top of a hundred-and-fifty-foot sand cliff , in a little town called Baiting Hollow . We had breakfast at an old diner in Riverhead . Ham and eggs , home fries , coffee , and toast . We listened to the radio ? " Anema c Core " and news bulletins on a local station that kept fading out . The short-order cook read the News . The only other customer was a fat girl who did n't finish her bacon and eggs . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on it . They had finished laying the foundations , and all the beams and joists of the first floor were in place . They were nailing a plywood deck  --  a subfloor  --  over the beams and joists . A strong wind was whooshing up the cliff , and it took four men to hold down a four-foot-byeight-foot sheet of plywood . One man was Dick Reeve , one of the contractors  --  Harold R. Reeve &; Sons . ( The other contractors are Jim Reeve and John Reeve , his brothers . ) He came over , holding his hammer . Henry Korman said , " I think we ought to move the house two feet to the right . " Dick Reeve gripped his hammer a little tighter . Then they both grinned . The men took a coffee break . They sat in a Volkswagen bus . Dick said be was surprised the other men had showed up . There was another Harold R. Reeve &; Sons job in town , he said , where they could all be working indoors . Then he consulted Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of porches , the location of two dry wells . Dry wells collect the rainwater that runs off the roof of a house , so that it wo n't make gullies and cause erosion . The two men studied the plans for the house . Dick said that his brother Jim would he along presently . He said his other brother , who was working on a job in Southampton , had driven over once to look at the cliff house and would n't even get out of the car , it was so cold . " You must be the crazy brother , " said Henry . Dick laughed . He said he was afraid to tell the men the coffee break was over , because they would put a hatchet in his hack . He said he was going to go to Florida for a week later on . Henry said he was a weather jinx . " Every time I go anyplace , it freezes , " he said . " And me , too . " Henry ran down the cliff about ten feet to see where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were like . He came back and told Dick he ought to put some snow fencing just below the top of the cliff to build a dune . His plans almost blew away when he ran down the cliff . We went and sat in Henry 's car . Henry joined us and told us about a Norwegian carpenter he 'd once had who , when he had finished framing a house , nailed a pair of antlers to the top and drank a bottle of vodka . " One of the two kept off evil spirits , " Henry . said . Then Jim Reeve drove up in his car . He and Henry talked about the client  --  the man for whom Henri is building the house . Jim said the client had called up at a quarter to eleven on Saturday night to say he had been out to inspect the house and had seen a dog 's footprints in the footings  --  the concrete strips the foundations sit on . The client had wanted to know whether the footprints would affect the structure of the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People commission houses in the summer , " said Jim . " But they do n't giro the final O.K. to the plans until winter . And then they want the house finished by Memorial Day , so they can have cocktails on the porch . " Henry said next time he came out he 'd bring a bottle of bourbon . Jim said , " Good . Come at ten , and then we can knock off at eleven . " Henry said , " I think I 'll come at four . " Then he said , " Has everybody got his toes and fingers ? " and we left . Henry told us he was pleased . The men were doing a fast job and a good job , and they were using good materials . On the way back , we napped , waking only in Patchogue . We thought about nothing at all . When we got back to the city , we asked Henry what he had been thinking about . " Lunch , " he said . Tapestry WE dropped by the Metropolitan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about high-warp weaving versus low-warp weaving , millefleurs backgrounds , and the symbolic meaning of unicorns . The occasion was a members ' preview of the sumptuous new exhibit titled " Masterpieces of Tapestry from the Fourteenth to the Sixteenth Century , " and the atmosphere was a high-warp blend of scholarship and haute couture . As we walked through the front door , a fragile blonde in mulberry velvet handed us ri list of the evening 's events . On the ground floor , members were invited to drink in the candlelit Main Hall , dine in the Fountain Restaurant , attend a concert of fifteenth-century music in the Medieval Sculpture Court , or listen to a tapestry lecture in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium . Upstairs , one could see ninety-seven tapestries arranged in rough chronological order , a new color film on The Cloisters ' set of unicorn tapestries , or a talented Swedish weaver who was demonstrating that the art of tapestry is very much alive . IVe began at the lecture , where we found a huoyant Thomas Hoving announcing that this exhibit was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national mu- " Hold it ! For all we know , he may be making a citizen 's arrest . " scums of France . " It 's one of those shows that came together almost spontaneously , " Mr. Hoving said . " We had been thinking tapestries . They had been thinking tapestries . So we put our heads together and cosigned all the loan requests . W , chose **50;4667;TOOLONG because that was the golden age of tapestry-making . There were great religious cycles , vast classical stories , and vivid , imaginative scenes of life in the Middle Ages . Tapestries were made for enjoyment , for political , religious , and financial reasons , and to keep people warm . They were the frescoes of the North , but they were much more mobile than frescoes , because you could pack a very large tapestry like ' David and Bathsheba ' into a small wooden case and take it along with you on a campaign . In the fourteenth century , having a great tapestry set was like having several hundred shares of I.B.M . stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit , using color slides , and remarked that many of the designs seemed incredibly modern . " We have Chagall , Matisse , Dufy , and Leger up there , " he said , " and they 're all six hundred years old . Now stampede up to the show , all of you ! " After visiting the tapestry rooms and being dazzled , we fell into conversation with Stuart Silver , the designer of the 30 MARCH 4 , 1 9 7 4 exhibit , and asked him how he had managed to make the tapestries glow . " There is n't a white light in the place , " said Mr. Silver . " N'Ve 've used straw-colored filters to achieve a golden atmosphere that is supposed to remind you of candlelight , or sunlight filtering through parchment windows . That 's how tapestries looked five or six hundred years ago , when they were new . We have also tried to direct your eyes to certain details by focussing an extra spot on a face , a figure , a village in the distance , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reflection in her mirror . Does n't she just leap out at you We moved on to a room lined with scenes from the Trojan War , where we encountered Genevieve Souchal , a tall , pretty French tapestry expert , who turned out to be the author of the exhibition 's handsome catalogue . " How old are tapestries ? " we asked Mme. Souchal . " Tapestry-weaving goes back at least to the Egyptians , " replied Mme. Souchal , " but only a few fragments of ancient tapestries have survived  --  mostly in tombs . In western Europe , there were no pictorial tapestries before the fourteenth century . Then , about 1350 , there was a kind of tapestry explosion in Paris and Arras that was due , we think , to the patronage of Louis , Due d'Anjou and Regent of France , and his brothers  --  jean , Duc de Berry , and Philip the Bold . They were all great collectors of art and they loved luxury . The ' Angers Apocalypse , ' which was woven for Louis by Nicolas Bataille , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And here in New York we have only one of the seven pieces . The complete tapestry , which is more than two hundred feet long , is still the largest in the world . " Mme. Souchal added that nearly all the tapestries in the exhibit were essentially Gothic in spirit . " Their uniqueness comes from the fact that most of them were produced at a time when the art of tapestrv-making was independent from , and somewhat more advanced than , panel painting , " she said . " Then , around 1500 , the Renaissance introduced itself into tapestry art . Weavers and cartoonists discovered perspective , and tapestries became large woven paintings . Many elements of design were lost . Although a few pieces in the exhibit are Renaissance in spirit , it has been mostly confined to the period when tapestry design was an art by " What is your favorite tapestry period ? " we asked . " I prefer the millefieurs tapestries that were produced at the end of the fifteenth century , " replied Mme. Souchal . " For me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the designs absolutely fit the es-sence of the tapestry idea . They have extraordinary qualities of color , poetry , and design , which come together in some mysterious way to produce a se-ries of unique masterpieces . There is nothing else like them in art They represent a state of grace that was never achieved again . " Dialogue ik SERIES of " Dialogues with Roberto Rossellini " is being held at the New School this semester , and we sat in on one of the dialogues , or seminars , the other evening and found the filmmaker holding forth on just about everything under the sun except filmmaking . Rossellini , who is sixty-seven , was wearing a brown tweed sports jacket , a blue shirt , a brown tie , and gray trousers . Sitting in a chromium-and-leather chair under a battery of overhead lights , lie talked for four and a half hours with sixteen students , whose ages ranged from about eighteen to about fifty . Using an informal , disco rsive approach , Rossellini more or less breezed through the history of human thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YORKER 31 nick 's , Descartes , the French Revolution , Buddha , Christ , Muhammad , clairvoyance , metaphysics , hiolo gy , metabiology , rationalism , positivism , drugs , censorship , freedom , television , and the role of the artist in society . Among his more arresting statements were " The reason for life is reason , not beauty , " " People are afraid of science today , " " There is a sort of endemic pathology in which we all live , " " The world is full of opinions and absolutch empty of knowledge , " " I hate Leonardo do Vinci , " and " Houston , Teas , is a strange town . " At one point , Rossellini departed from his philosophical approach to tell of something that had happened in Paris in the nineteen-fifties . " My wife and I had just driven Jean Renoir and his wife home one night , " he said . " They were living near the Place Pigalle . And as we all got out of the car , two men came up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pornographic films ? ' Well , Renoir was just furious he practically got violent and then some other people Caine up and took the side of the first men . One of these people had a knife and was about to attack us when someone in the crowd recognized us and said , ' Wait , do n't harm them ! The ) ' re in the same business we are ! They make films , too ! ' And that 's how we were saved . " When the seminar ended , the class , including Rossellini , headed for the apartment of one of the students , a young singer named Ellen Gould , who had invited everyone over for spaghetti and wine . For the past three nights , it seemed , Rossellini had been telling the class of his love for properly prepared spaghetti . On the way , we asked him why he had chosen not to discuss films in these seminars . " I am out of filmmaking now , " he said . " That is in the past , and C do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical documentaries for television . In any case , we have emphasized art too much . Artists have become like demigods in our society . It is better that they return to being what they were in the past before the beginning of the Ro-mantic period . Artists used to be humble , and that is what the ) should he again . " In Miss Gould 's apartment , Ros-sellin Sltt on a sofa , and the students gathered around him and went over some of the material they had discussed earlier . Meanwhile , Miss Gould went into the kitchen to prepare a pot of spaghetti . Periodically , Rosscllini glanced toward the kitchen . As time went by , we noticed that his attention was shifting gradually from the conversation around him to what was happening in the other room . Soon , he got up and joined Miss Gould by the stove . " Have n't you put in the salt yet he asked . " You must salt the water now . If you put in the salt later , it will make the spaghetti too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full boil before you put in the spaghetti . " " Is n't it boiling enough ? " she asked . " Those are 0013 tiny bubbles , " Rossellini said . " Besides , you need more water in the pot  --  it should be filled almost to the brim . " After a few moments , Miss Gould stepped hack so that Rossellini could take full charge of the cooking . Earlier in the evening , we recalled , he had spoken sharply against methodology , saying , " I think it is very healthy not to establish a method , because the moment you establish a method , you reduce the thing that you are doing . " Now , however , he showed that in at least one area he had a method . This is it : Bring water , well salted , to a full boil in a large pot . Add 4 16-ounce packages of spaghetti and boil from 12 to 15 minutes . Empty spaghetti into a colander . Rinse with cold water . Return spaghetti to pot and add 1 pound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well with whatever utensils are handy . ( In this case , a roast-beef fork and a pancake spatula . ) Add generous quantities of black pepper and mix again . Sprinkle still more pepper on top . ( Serves 20 . ) " I do n't like my spaghetti al dente , Sou know , " Rossellini said , with a broad smile , as Miss Gould and two of her guests began to serve the spaghetti to the others . " I like it just a little more than al dente  --  just a little hit more . " Everyone sat down to eat . The spaghetti was just a little bit more than al dente , and it was marvellous .
