In making public the voluminous data on his personal finances , President Nixon somewhat blithely announced that the tangle of figures raised only two questions , and that both of them could be settled by the Congressional Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation . Last week the committee , headed by Arkansas Congressman Wilbur Mills and Louisiana Senator Russell Long , agreed to review Nixon 's tax returns for the past four years . The legislators , however , will not just look into the two points that the President chose to cite , but they say that they will comprehensively examine the whole tax strategy that has helped make him a millionaire . That should make them busier than an accounting firm in April . As he has in so many of the other controversies swirling about his Administration , Nixon in baring his financial record sorely underestimated his - and his critics ' - capacity to raise new questions ( see THE PRESS ) . <P> Nixon insisted that the only matters open to inquiry involved his donation of some of his vice-presidential pa pers ( diaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure to report any capital gain on the sale of part of his property in San Clemente , Calif . <P> There are indeed questions still to be answered in those transactions , plus many more in other areas . Among them : <P> Did Nixon donate his papers to the Government in time to claim the tax privileges that he took ? A tightening in the tax laws ended deductions for gifts of such material , effective July 25 , 1969 . On that date , according to a General Services Administration investigation performed at the request of Connecticut Senator Lowell Weicker , the President 's documents were being kept at the National Archives in an area reserved for " courtesy storage " and they were neither sorted nor formally valued until later in the year . The President still retains control over access to all the pa pers , which are stored in the Archives . <P> The deed for the material that Nixon 's appraiser eventually chose to give was not delivered to the Archives until April 10 , 1970 - almost nine months after the cutoff date . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was signed by Nixon legal aides rather than the President himself , might have been predated . Over the next four years Nixon used the gift of the papers to avoid $235,000 in income taxes that he otherwise would have owed .
