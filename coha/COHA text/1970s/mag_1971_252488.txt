Crewcut , clear-eyed and firm of jaw , Colonel Gerald V. Kehrli had been a model Air Force officer for 28 years . In May 1970 , he took command of a less-than-spirited air transport squadron at Saigon 's Tan Son Nhut airbase , and before long the unit was back at a peak of morale . " It was guys like Colonel Kehrli who gave you that go-go spirit , " one of his former officers said last week . " He was the kind of man you really wanted to work for . " <P> As it turned out , the squadron was high on Kehrli in more ways than one . In Saigon , a military court sentenced the colonel to three years in prison and fined him $15,000 not only for being an enthusiastic user of marijuana but also for passing it around to his men , often at pot parties in his quarters . At the colonel 's trial , a young intelligence officer testified that Kehrli had even been a pot proselytizer at Saigon military officers ' clubs . " Marijuana is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one conversation . " It allows me to understand my men and close the generation gap . I use marijuana and both my officers and enlisted men use marijuana . " <P> Candy Habits . Outside Kehrli &; Co. , few career men-and even fewer field-grade officers ( major and above ) - ever develop a sustained taste for Pleiku Pink , Bleu de Hu , Cambodian-made Park Lane No. 2s , and the myriad other varieties of marijuana that have become freely available in South Viet Nam . But many other military men do . " Nobody raises an eyebrow now if someone suggests that out in the field , where the arm of military law is relatively relaxed , 90% of all noncareer G.I.s smoke grass , " reports TIME Correspondent James Willwerth . " It is as common as chewing gum here , and the young officers are smoking it nearly as much as the enlisted men . " <P> Pot has been a pervasive feature of the G.I. scene since the mid-1960s , when canny Vietnamese ( who prefer to chew betel nuts or smoke opium themselves ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigating team returned from Viet Nam with a report that drugs had become a serious " military problem . " Last month the U.S. command in Saigon announced an all-out campaign against narcotics , complete with a 64-page directive and plans for ground and aerial searches for fields where marijuana is grown . Military surveys taken over the past two years have shown that from 30% to 45% of the troops in Viet Nam have used drugs , mainly marijuana . Of the 11,000 G.I.s who were apprehended or investigated last year for drug violations , 75% were pot smokers . <P> What most worries American commanders is the more recent-and more dangerous-spread of heroin . In 1966 , there were only four disciplinary cases involving hard drugs ; in 1970 , there were 1,751 cases . In one 79-day period last year , 75 G.I.s died of suspected or confirmed use of heroin . Perhaps one in five G.I.s has smoked or " snorted " heroin . " Shooting " it with a needle is not yet widespread , which means that most heroin-addicted G.I.s in Viet Nam have weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , warns Colonel Thornton E. Ireland , the U.S. provost marshal in Viet Nam , " We 've got a problem . Do n't let anyone kid you . "
