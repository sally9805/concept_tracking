THE INTRICATE MUSIC , A BIOGRAPHY OF JOHN STEINBECK by Thomas Kiernan ; Little , Brown ; 331 pages ; $12.95 <P> John Steinbeck worked hard to turn himself into a genius and he almost made it . His youth was a laborious struggle to find his true voice . But as this first full-scale biography shows , the author flourished for a scant dozen years : from the publication of The Red Pony in 1933 to Cannery Row in 1945 . <P> Kiernan ( a journeyman who has written books on such disparate personalities as Yasser Arafat and Jane Fonda ) met his subject only twice , and he worked without the direct cooperation of Steinbeck 's widow . A more thorough account of the career might have provided a less gloomy view of the man , but it seems doubtful . Steinbeck always feared biography . " Writers , " he told Kiernan , " are by their very nature private people , in many cases lonely , frightened , insecure , incapable of relating comfortably to other people . " The sentence was pure confessional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uncongenial native of Salinas , Calif . His parents , a prosperous feed and grain merchant and his wife , did not take kindly to John 's literary ambitions . Still , they supported him through repeated failures at Stanford , and helped him out with stipends until he was past 30 . He needed them ; his income for the first period of steady writing was $870 , or about $125 a year . Many years later the senior Stein beck confided the reasons for his generosity . Never in his life , he admitted sadly , had he achieved " any of the things he had dreamed of achieving . " This , Kiernan reports , " was the reason he had been so tolerant of John 's ambition , and in his last years so supportive ; he did not want his son to suffer the bitter regret that he had . " <P> Steinbeck earned his first serious acclaim when The Red Pony appeared in the North American Review . But years afterward , critics still regarded him as a newcomer . Alfred Kazin praised him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beck still looks like a distinguished apprentice , and what is so striking in his work is its inconclusiveness , his moving approach to human life and yet his failure to be creative with it . " <P> Such towering works as Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath earned him a Nobel Prize in 1962 . But the honor did not bring a revival . Steinbeck declined into illness and disillusion . Kiernan reports that when the author died at 66 , in 1968 , he " had grudgingly accepted the fact that his own artistic productivity had long ended " - as evidenced by the potboilers that marred his later years : East of Eden and The Winter of Our Discontent . <P> He need not have fretted so ; the early imperishable books retain their power to move readers and influence novelists . <P> " Man , " wrote Steinbeck in The Grapes of Wrath , " unlike any other thing organic or inorganic in the universe , grows beyond his work , walks up the stairs of his concepts , emerges ahead of his accomplishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other works are simply more evidence that some writers were never meant to grow up .
