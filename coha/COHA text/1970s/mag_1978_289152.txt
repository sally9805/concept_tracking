" You 're always remembered , " Letitia Baldrige says , " if you are tall . " <P> Tish Baldrige is a very memorable character . At 6 ft. 1 in. , with her strong , intelligent head held at full altitude , her white hair swept back in the Fifth Avenue mane , she enters a room with queenly bearing . But Tish manages to mitigate her formidable presence : she is a direct and funny woman with a clear gaze and a trace of self-mockery . Far from stuffy about good taste , she is even given to repeating the awful and ancient schoolyard joke that is a painful memory to every oversize woman : " Confucius say , boy who dance with tall girl get bust in the mouth . " <P> Although she has revised Amy Vanderbilt 's Complete Book of Etiquette , nothing of the sedate Vere de Vere clings to Baldrige . She has been charging full blast most of her life . She approaches manners from the perspective of a working woman who did not marry until she was 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears black dresses and pearls , and head of her own Manhattan public relations firm , Letitia Baldrige Enterprises , Inc . At 51 she serves on the board of directors of three companies ( the New York Bank for Savings , Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , and Outlet Co. of Providence ) and writes a weekly column , " Contemporary Living , " which is syndicated in some 40 newspapers by the Los Angeles Times . <P> Not surprisingly , Baldrige 's theory of manners is brisk : apart from simple kindness , she says , their chief purpose is to make life more efficient . <P> Tish came from a well-off , but by no means rich lawyer 's family in Omaha . Her father , Howard Malcolm Baldrige , a strikingly handsome athlete at Yale who was decorated in both World Wars , served as a Republican Congressman from Nebraska for two terms . <P> At 14 Tish was sent east to Miss Porter 's School in Farmington , Conn . She went to Vassar at 16 , graduating at 19 with a B.A. in psychology . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted to work in Europe . She displayed even then her persistent ability to stand back , set goals and methodically fulfill them . The State Department said she would need secretarial skills even to apply for a job overseas ; she knocked off a year-long secretarial curriculum in eight weeks . <P> Her career began with a series of lucky strokes . In her first job in the Foreign Service , she worked in Paris for David Bruce , who was helping to set up the Marshall Plan . When Bruce was named U.S. Ambassador to France , Tish became social secretary to him and his wife Evangeline . In 1951 she worked briefly for the CIA on " a lot of secret stuff . " Then , having learned Italian from a contessa and a tape recorder , she landed a job as social secretary to the U.S. Ambassador to Italy , Clare Boothe Luce , who became a close friend and is now godmother to Tish 's 13-year-old daughter Clare .                 @ @ @ @
