 |p565  AT FIRST it was only a motion , a fluid curve rounding into a recurve on the coarse sand of the sea floor . Distinct from the restive darting and questing of the uncountable kinds of fish that crowd Australia 's Great Barrier Reef , it was a movement that has evoked human fascination and fear since man became man . Motion merged into matter . The sea snake moved away , lissome and unhurried . I followed , finning along the surface . An air-breather fashioned in the forests of the earth , this cousin of cobras has become a water animal , destined to remain forever a creature of the sea . His family , the Hydrophiidae , is large and varied . Its members are probably the most numerous snakes in the world . Yet they are the least known of reptiles ; few people of the West are aware that sea serpents , monsters of every mythology , actually exist . And they are perhaps the most venomous of vertebrates .

Asian fishermen , mainly ? have died from the bites of sea snakes , some of which possess a venom many times more virulent than that known for any land snake . Despite the fact that short fangs and ? in some cases ? small heads may make biting difficult , despite the reluctance of certain genera to attack even when provoked , bites do occur and fatalities follow . The bite itself is painless . However , after several hours the legs of the victim become paralyzed , his eyes close , and his jaws lock . He may live for several days before convulsions and respiratory failure bring death . Beware of the Surfacing Serpent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 43-foot steel-hulled Sea Hunt into the shelter of a reef . The " country " was all beneath the surface . Here in the Swain Reefs , 160 miles from Queensland 's coast , only a few treeless sand cays rise above the sea . We had come to this remote region of bursting surf and treacherous shoals to observe and photograph sea snakes underwater ? something few divers and fewer scientists have done . We hoped to study their foraging and feeding patterns , their relationship to other reef animals , and their behavior toward man , a matter of considerable personal interest to us , the potential victims . The Swain group , and the Saumarez Reef beyond in the Coral Sea , contain superb settings , the extreme clarity of water we required , and several species of sea snakes . So said Ben Cropp , one of Australia 's best divers and undersea photographers , when he suggested our expedition . Dr. Harold Heatwole , an American herpetologist at the University  |p568  of New England , in New South Wales , agreed . They were right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second snake appeared , then a third . Ben , Hal , and I converged on them . Eva , Ben 's wife and diving partner , joined us . Before long , we knew , one of the snakes would come up for air . " That 's the worst time , " Ben had warned us . " That 's when they notice you , and sometimes come right at you . " Suits Protect Against Cold and Quarry Ben and Eva set their underwater cameras for close range . Hal and I tested our snake sticks ? aluminum rods with pistol grips at one end and tonglike jaws at the other . We were covered head to toe by diving suits of foam rubber to protect against the July chill of the austral winter ? and the possibility of snakebite . Although at least one offshore sea snake , Astrotia , can bite through quarter-inch neoprene foam , the suits offered fair protection against the shorter-fanged species . One of the snakes left the bottom , angling sharply upward . He saw us , shifted course , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an olive sea snake , Aipysurus laevis . His kind could reach better than six feet in length , with a heavy body and a mouth big enough for serious biting . He had a neat , blunt cobra head and the cobra 's large dark eye . His face was pleasant , fixed in a small smile . He kept on coming . What would he do ? Probably nothing . What could he do ? Kill one of us , perhaps , if he could pierce our rubber armor . He came within six inches of my right leg . But the jaws remained closed , the pace leisurely . He took a single breath , and headed for the bottom . Snake hunting is a sometime thing . We moved around the Swains , sometimes finding a solitary olive snake on the prowl around the foot of a coral head , sometimes seeing no serpentine sign at all . Then , one morning , a new and imposing kind of sea serpent came winding and glittering into the hazy edge of my field of vision . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterned body as thick as my arm , and a broad unsmiling head . I dove too soon and grabbed too quickly . My snake stick caught the animal well back along his body . Immediately he turned , snapping viciously , and began sliding back toward my right hand . The jaws of the snake stick could not hold him . I resisted the impulse to drop snake and snake stick and do my best to walk upon the water ( there being no way to get out of it . made a left-handed grab for a point just behind the gaping pink mouth , and held on . My foam-rubber gloves , I reasoned , would protect me if I missed and he did n't . The snake threw a couple of coils around my arm , braced to bite if my grip should loosen . I made urgently for the distant boat crawled up the ladder , flipped my victim into a wet burlap bag , and sat down to do a little serious breathing . Hal came aboard to view my catch . " Great ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's a big one . " " I know , " I said , stretching and flexing my cramped fingers . " He was really trying to bite you . " I nodded in fullest agreement . " Let 's find out what would have happened if he had , " I suggested . We found a paper-wrapped candy bar . stuck it in a finger of the glove and offered the glove to A. stokesii . He clamped down on the finger . I pulled out the candy bar . There were neat fang holes in its wrapper . " That 's interesting , " said Hal , with masterly understatement . Close Calls , but No Catastrophes Other snakes turned up . We collected several , all olive snakes . One demonstrated the versatility of the serpentine head by dislocating his jaws and sliding the top one over to hang a fang in my gloved finger . That one , fortunately , did not penetrate . Hal flipped another snake into the boat , only to meet him coming down the ladder as he was going up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning we strapped on Aqua-Lungs and fanned out across a new stretch of bottom . Ben beckoned to me from 75 feet away As I swam toward him , I saw him maneuvering to get shots of a pair of snakes . Mating ? I could n't tell . There was reason to believe that Tangling with trouble , Eva Cropp clings desperately to an olive snake that attacked as she tried to snare it . When the three-foot reptile snapped at her gloved hand , Mrs. Cropp pulled its tail , causing the head end to react by holding fast to the stick . She eventually maneuvered her catch to the boat , where captured snakes were studied and their venom collected @#  |p570  this midwinter period was the mating season , and we had planned our visit with that in mind . Some scientists had suggested that sea snakes are most aggressive at mating time . I never did find out whether Ben 's two snakes were mating or not . As soon as I got near them , one turned and came at me ; not with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly and jerkily . Sea creatures betray their intentions by the way they move . Their faces may be expressionless , but their bodies are eloquent . The snake coming at me seemed bent on urgent business , and his body language said so . I picked up the first defensive weapon that came to hand : a large , stiff sea slug . As the snake darted close , I pushed it away with the slug . A saffron blur streaked over my right shoulder . I felt a tug on my arm and saw a gaping mouth bite and bite again . I dropped the sea slug and grabbed the writhing body , pulling it free , then releasing it before the head could reach my fingers . The snake vanished , to reappear between my legs . He snapped at my flippers and got his short fangs into my left leg ? or rather , into the thick rubber that covered it . This onslaught ( pages 564-5 ) lasted close to two minutes . Dedicated photographer that he is , Ben kept shooting pictures instead of wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last my tormentor headed for the bottom , still twitching with rage . According to the laws of nature , I , the intruder , was defeated and would soon be dead ? as I probably would have been , had I been swimmin in my own skin instead of a rubber one . Scientist Keeps His Homework on Ice In a few days ' time we had a good numbeof snakes aboard , all of them of the olive variety except for the heavy , muscular beast I'r : caught the first day . Since he was unique ir . our collection , and since Astrotia stokesii hard to remember , we called him Claude ? I suppose because the name was so perfectl ' inappropriate . Several of the snakes had died . for no apparent reason , as sea snakes sometimes do in captivity .

Now it was time for him to catch up on his herpetological homework . There are about fifty kinds of sea snakes ; most occur -- and probably evolved ? in warm south Asian and Australian coastal waters . A few species are found as far away as Japan and the Persian Gulf . One , the yellow-bellied Pelamis , has crossed to tropical America 's west coast , and lives by the million in the Bay of Panama . Sea snake species differ in form and be.tvior , but have certain features in common . " We 're trying to find out how life underwater has affected the bodies of these creatures , " Hal said , laying out limp specimens And sharp implements . " Some of the adaptations are obvious : The flattened , rudderlike tail ; the nostrils set on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equipped with flaps to Keep them closed underwater ; the smaller Size of the broad belly plates that land snakes : se in crawling . But there are others you ca n't see at a ; ante , like the specially adapted gland in the mouth that helps get rid of salt from the sea water they drink . I 'm looking for more of those internal changes . " Hal opened the body cavity of a snake and injected brightly colored latex into the veins and arteries . " This stuff will harden , so that later , at the university , we 'll be able to study the whole circulatory system . " " What about the lungs ? " I asked . " Some sea snakes can stay down for two hours or more between breaths . How do they manage ? " " Here 's part of the answer , " Hal said , exposing a membranous sac three-quarters as long as the snake itself . " Like most snakes , sea snakes have only one lung , but theirs is a big one . Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But here , at the very end , there 's a simple sac in which air is stored . " Another device for stretching a dive is a controllable heartbeat . These animals can slow their pulse rate by 50 percent when they go under . " But diving time varies with species , activity , and water temperature . The biggest have relatively bigger lungs and can stay down  |p572  longer . An active snake has to come up more often than a resting one . And as the water gets warmer , diving time gets shorter . " As he reached for the next specimen , something about the first caught his attention . " Hah ! Look here . A male , and in breeding condition . Here are masses of sperm cells , ready to be implanted in the oviducts of a female . The females of many species ? sea and land can store these cells inside their bodies for weeks or even years , until they have eggs ready for fertilization . The sperm fertilizes the eggs in the oviduct . In many species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . " Some Snakes Immune to Others ' Venom Our lesson in reptilian physiology was interrupted by a commotion off the starboard beam . Ron , it appeared , had slipped unobtrusively overboard ( as usual ) and now surfaced in a state of perceptible agitation ( not at all as usual ) . He was treading water , whirling over his head a large olive snake that he held bare-handed by the tail , and uttering loud and fervent sounds . The full text of his message was garbled by the waves that submerged his mouth , but its gist was clear : " Somebody get this blubble snake off me blubble hands . " We threw him a burlap bag to wrap it in . Ron came aboard smiling and breathing just a little deeply . ( Topflight Australian divers like Ron , Ben , and Eva do not go in much for gasping . ) He was also sucking his finger . " Bite you , did he ? " I asked , sure that he had not . Ron enjoys a joke now and then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll be ' right . " Then , seeing my look of concern and , rising to the occasion , he intoned : " Ow ! I 've been bitten and I 'm going to die . This is the end of me ! Boss glancing heavenward , here I come . Soon you will all hear the drumming of me heels on the deck and see the rolling of me eyeballs as the convulsions seize me . " Hal persisted . " Did he get poison in , do you think ? I 've got some antivenin . It 's not for olive snake venom there 's no serum for any of these reef snakes yet ? but it works for one of the coastal species , and it might help . " " No , Hal , he never got to chew on me , just dragged a fang across the skin . If anything got in , I 've sucked it out . " Whether he had , or whether the sea snake had withheld its venom ( as these animals can do at will ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies had been published on the poisons of the two species we had collected , Hal ran some preliminary tests . His laboratory mice proved Claude and the olive snakes to be intensely venomous , and both genera proved themselves immune to their own and each other 's venom . Having fairly sampled the Swains , we pushed on to the Saumarez Reef , 50 miles away to the east . Here , we knew , were other species of sea snakes and a different underwater environment . We got under way at midnight in order to arrive after nine in the morning . You ca n't feel your way into a complex of coral heads when the sun is low and the surface of the sea Shipboard scientist , herpetologist Dr. Harold I-leatwole ( left ) fills a sea snake lung with water to determine its volume . Nearly three-quarters as long as the snake itself , the lung terminates in an air-storage sac that allows the animal to take long underwater tours after a split-second breath . @# Struggling killer yields its venom to science . An instant after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? concealed here by tissue of the mouth through the collecting jar 's rubber cover . The visible teeth serve only to hold prey .  |p574  reflects its light . Ron , Ben , and I took turns at the helm during the night passage , watching the compass 's red glow and the white-topped black masses of the big beam seas rolling in out of the darkness . Although there is no dry land on the Saumarez Reef , it boasts a landmark visible for miles ; a U. S. Liberty ship , high and almost dry on the outer coral rampart , rising 80 feet above the white water that swirls around it . Blown onto the coral by a cyclone in 1945 , the Francis Preston Blair still looks from a distance like a ship under way instead of the forlorn , rust-rotted ruin she is . We sighted her at dawn , and by midmorning we swung at anchor behind the reef on which the sad hulk stood . On the ocean side a few hundred yards away , cobalt breakers as big as houses exploded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holds Deadly Peril Beneath the surface we found a marine world different from that of the Swains . Extraordinary visibility ? up to 200 feet , we reckoned ? and a smaller fish population gave it an empty look , a sense of ocean and remoteness from the realm of man . But the snakes were there . I spotted a slender tinyheaded specimen on the first dive , and added Microcephalophis gracilis ? one of the two most venomous sea snakes ? to our list . Exploring the reef edge , Ben found a mating pair , small dark creatures of a still unnamed species . The two intertwined for a moment and then rose straight up , still half encircling each other , to separate at the surface . The male made a quite understandable lunge at me before heading off over the reeftop , as his mate subsided gently to the sandy bottom . We let them go . Other snakes appeared : first an olive snake , which came to inspect our swaying anchor chain with apparently amorous fascination . We followed it on its rounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it passed by little fish without so much as a snap of the jaws . I had noticed this curious behavior before and wondered at it . Unlike M. gracilis and some other small-headed snakes that live on fish eggs , the olive snake is a fish eater . But how did it stay alive if it never pursued a fish ? This time I knew . Hal had explained that this particular species can not catch fish unless it corners them in crevices . Placed in an aquarium with free-swimming fish , the olive snake will starve . A silvery flash near the foot of a coral cliff caught my eye . I swam over and saw , for the first and last time , a snake that had proved itself a successful hunter . It belonged to the dark new species ( probably part of the Aipysurus clan ) , and it held in its mouth a perfectly motionless fish about 21/2 inches long , gleaming white , with a few liver-colored spots : a crevice dweller , seized by stealth in the Aipysurus tradition . Later I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bommie ( as Australians call a coral head ) , a 50-foot monolith rising out of pure sand . I eased along the bottom , peering into caves and crannies and feeling something like an olive snake myself . A glossy little black snake appeared , gentle as a kitten . It made no attempt to bite as I slipped it into a net bag . I showed Hal my new acquisition . " Do you know what you have here ? " he asked , peering closely at my little shiny black snake . " Do you know what this is ? " he added rhetorically . " This animal is a melanistic variant of Emydocephalus annulatus . " He meant a black version of the turtle-headed. ringed sea snake . " That makes five species so far . Not bad . " I said . " Happiness is another species of sea snake . " said Hal . Even Sharks Shun Sea Snakes The next morning we collected another M. gracilis , which we found with its minute head stuck into a hole in the sand from which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched it for 37 minutes , not wishing to interrupt its meal , until cold , boredom , and the arrival of a large shark moved us to unplug it from the bottom . During the entire span of its leisurely meal . M. gracilis protruded blind and unprotected from an open expanse of sand bottom , exposed to attack from any predator . The processes of evolution could not have allowed the species to develop such relaxed eating habits if there had been any danger that they would lead in time to the extinction of the species . Obviously , this and other sea snakes have few enemies . Apart from some Asians , who eat sea snakeand sell their skins , sea eagles are the on : : . creatures proven to feed regularly on the , reptiles . They seize them on the surface .1-they come up to breathe , and drop them 0 rocks to kill them . p 575 Sharks ? Despite the fact that Hal has occasionally found snakes in sharks ' stomachs , trawlermen report that these scavengers , which eat everything else they throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish ? The hordes of tento hundred-pound snappers and groupers that seem to dominate Australian reef life are all capable of eating snakes , and are largely protected by their heavy scales from the bite of a counterattacking reptile . Yet we had watched hundreds of such fish ignore living ? and dead sea snakes , and seen that the sea snakes have no inbred fear of them . An observer of the life cycles in snake country would be tempted to risk a generalization : " Flesh-eating fish do n't eat sea snakes . " And he would be wrong . Like most generalizations , this one needs a qualifier . The qualifying word is " Pacific . " Pacific flesh-eating fish do n't normally eat sea snakes " is probably a defensible proposition . Some Atlantic fish of the same snapper and grouper families , according to a fascinating study by Dr. Ira Rubinoff and Dr. Chaim kropach of the Smithsonian 's Tropical Research Institute , will eat sea snakes when they are given the opportunity . Which , in nature , would be never , since there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the genetic conditioning of the present Pacific fish signals to them a fact that their forebears had to learn the hard way : " If you eat sea snakes , you die . " And fact it is . For though sea-snake meat is edible , and the venom harmless when digested , a snake swallowed whole may bite the stomach lining of its captor and kill it . And unlike sharks , which often mangle their prey before swallowing it , snappers and groupers down theirs intact . Thus , in theory , Pacific fish died , and eventually their kind became programmed not to eat snakes . Exceptional fish with an appetite for snakes were selectively killed off before they could spawn more snake eaters . But according to the Smithsonian study , Atlantic Like a magician 's rope , willowy Microcephalophis gracilis rises from the sea floor , its buried head probing a hole for fish eggs . On such food-hunting forays the serpent engorges itself with sand that passes through harmlessly . Eyes covered and body exposed , this five-foot specimen fed for nearly 40 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely in size and color . Light-hued Astrotia stokesii , the most massive sea snake , can reach the thickness of a man 's forearm . But in deadliness it bows to one of the sea 's most poisonous reptiles , Microcephalophis gracilis , whose name means " slender smallheaded snake . " The snub-nosed olive snake at right can grow to six feet . carnivores , uninhibited by any such genetic mechanisms , gulp down whole snakes and sometimes die as a result . Occasionally they regurgitate the living reptile before dying , which suggests that the individual snake ( and not his posterity alone ) may benefit by biting . In any case , it is probable that if Atlantic fish and sea snakes are brought together in large numbers , as they might be by the proposed sea-level Panama canal , there would be an ecological crisis . At first , the fish may attack the snakes . But as soon as the Atlantic carnivores learn what their Pacific relatives already know , and avoid the deadly reptiles , sea snakes might infest the Caribbean . Hand-fed Fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Pelamis , the only sea snake found on the west coast of tropical America , and with tank-adapted American fish . Yet we felt that their theories should apply equally to the Australian reef creatures . We decided to try a similar test in nature at Heron Island , an attractive little resort whose undersea surroundings are protected from spear fishermen and collectors . Fish at Heron eat what divers hand them . Would that include sea snakes , or pieces thereof ? We headed for Heron , 20 hours away , to find out . Ben , Eva , and I set up our feeding station about twenty feet down . Soon a dozen assorted members of the grouper family had rallied around . As Ben photographed and I watched , Eva took bits of coral trout from a plastic bag and held them out to the circling fish . A sort of feeding frenzy developed ; the groupers occasionally broke away to tear into a school of little fish and emerge with chomping jaws . Now Eva tossed out a small dead sea snake . Instantly three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped it . Next came a piece of skinned snake . A blue cod swallowed it at once , then broke out of the feeding circle in apparent distress , gulping and stretching his gill covers . He retired to deeper water , his appetite clearly ruined for the moment . As a final test Eva tied a dead snake to a piece of trout flesh . Repeatedly , the fish struck , dislodged the piece of bait and ignored the snake . Then a Maori cod , bolder than the others , seized both snake and bait at the same time . He swallowed the meat and perhaps , in the process , got part of the snake down his gullet ( preceding pages ) . In any case , like the blue cod , he stopped , gulped , and headed for deep water . There he holed up in a tiny cave and proceeded to swallow the entire snake . Which , I suppose , only goes to prove that the soundest theories admit of exceptions . Still , the main point was abundantly reestablished : That sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . live safely in the murderous jungle of the coral reef through the magic of the venom that some of them ? the egg eaters , for instance ? never use . Neither hiding nor hurrying , these migrants from the airy realms of brush and forest now live unfeared and unfearing in the stone wilderness of coral seas , untroubled aliens at home in an alien world .
