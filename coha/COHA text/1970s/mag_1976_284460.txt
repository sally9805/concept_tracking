The juicy , well-marbled rib roast on the cover of the Atlantic Monthly 's March issue looks tasty enough , but the magazine did not appeal to executives at Safeway Stores , Inc. , the nation 's largest supermarket chain ( 1975 sales : $9.7 billion ) . After a memo alerting stores to the issue went out from the chain 's Oakland , Calif , headquarters last month , some Safeway stores removed the magazine from their newsstand shelves . <P> What bothered the company about the issue was an unflattering account of food industry merchandising and meat-labeling practices . The 5,000-word article , titled " RipOff at the Supermarket " and excerpted from a forthcoming book on the food industry by Pop-Sociologist John Keats ( The Sheepskin Psychosis , The Insolent Chariots ) , does not mention Safeway specifically . While denying that the company actually banned the magazine , Safeway spokesmen do say , without going into specifics , that they found the article to be " anti-industry " in posture-as indeed it was . Although it contained some roundhouse generalities ( the food industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supermarket people take us for fools " ) , the story focused largely on one independent store-owner 's account of shady retail practices , such as short-weighting meat and passing off inferior fish as sole . <P> " We do n't question Safeway 's right to sell what they please , " said Publisher Garth Hite . " But it is kind of depressing to think that they would treat ideas as if they were mere bottles of catsup. "
