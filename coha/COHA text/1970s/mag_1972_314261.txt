THE SENATE <P> ONE-THIRD of the Senate-actually , 33 members out of the body 's 100-are up for election this year . The retiring Senate has been under Democratic control , 55-45 ; Republicans must gain five seats if a re-elected Nixon is to have a friendlier , G.O.P.-organized chamber in his second term . The odds are long against that happening . Barring a political miracle , most Republican analysts set their probable gain at two . <P> Some contests to watch : <P> &gt; NORTH CAROLINA . His name is so long that first-generation Greek-American Nick Galifianakis , 43 , divides it between two campaign buttons and explains the spelling as beginning with a " gal " and ending with a " kiss . " North Carolinians do not seem to mind that kind of corn . Shaggy-haired three-term Congressman Galifianakis , who upset Everett Jordan in the Democratic primary , is now a narrow favorite to win . <P> The odds would be longer were it not for the Nixon landslide apparently building in North Carolina . Opponent Jesse Helms , 51 , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , indeed , switched to the G.O.P. only two years ago . Arch-conservative Helms , who also broadcast over an 80-station radio " tobacco network " in eastern North Carolina before he took a political leave , criticizes even Nixon as too liberal . <P> &gt; ALABAMA . To such Alabama place names as Arab , Boaz , Opp and Eufaula can be added , for this election , Scylla and Charybdis . If the White House does not support the campaign of former Postmaster General Winton M. Blount , 51 , it loses an opportunity to gain another Republican seat . If , on the other hand , it supports Blount successfully against patriarchal 26-year Senate Veteran John J. Sparkman , 72 , then Liberal Democrat William Proxmire will likely succeed Sparkman as Senate Banking Committee chairman . " Who the hell wants Proxmire ? " is a common business view . The White House appears to have opted for keeping John Sparkman . Three months ago , Sparkman received a significant presidential " Dear John " letter commending him for " responsible " action in supporting the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat Sam Nunn , 34 , a grandnephew of Carl Vinson , who served for 50 years in the House , hopes to win a Georgia Senate seat himself by rekindling ancient urban-rural differences . Whether Nunn , a farmer , lawyer , state legislator and ex-basketball star from middle Georgia , can succeed may depend partly on the popularity of Richard Nixon among traditional rural Democrats and on a well-mounted G.O.P. campaign . <P> Republican Candidate Fletcher Thompson , 47 , despite his base in a middle-class Atlanta suburb , appeals to much the same constituency as Nunn . Three-Term Congressman Thompson is an unreconstructed conservative who opposes busing , liberal judges , Jane Fonda in Hanoi , Black Power and gun controls . Nunn was an early favorite but the two are now roughly even .
