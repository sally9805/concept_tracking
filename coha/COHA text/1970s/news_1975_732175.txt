txt Mayor Abraham D. Beame has hoisted his ax for more hefty swings at New York City 's overgrown $12.3-billion budget ? while shouting for a little help from Washington . President Ford , though , seems too busy polishing up his own budget ax for similar whacks at federal spending to be too sympathetic . With the President trying to push Congress into trimming federal spending by $28 billion and financing an $80-billion federal deficit of his own , Ford administration officials say they simply can not afford to prop up New York City ? and other American cities similarly in trouble . Showing he means business in putting the city 's financial house in order , Mayor Beame has whittled out plans for a 6 percent budget cut that will reduce city spending by $200 million . The trims include a continuation of a wage freeze for city workers and a reduction in the city work force by 20,000 , an increase of 13,000 over previously announced job cuts . In addition , the Mayor took initial steps toward dismantling three of the city 's nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than $20,000 a year and one earning $38,771 . Angered at the Mayor 's plans for further layoffs and particularly the extended wage freeze , municipal employee union leaders warn they will not accept the cuts and that " wildcat " strikes will accompany more layoffs . The Emergency Financial Control Board , the state overseer legislated into existence to make certain the city sets its financial house in order , has given the city three years to trim $800 million from its budget . It is hoped the moves to come up with a slimmed and balanced city budget will convince investors that New York City is again a good credit risk . Another problem is the state control board 's rejection of the agreement that ended the city 's recent five-day teachers ' strike . A new teachers ' strike is not considered likely , but agreements between teachers and the board of education will not be reached easily . City officials hoped that recent statements by Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller and top administration economists indicate a soft ening in President Ford 's attitude toward at least guaranteeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmarketable since March . What worries Ford economic advisers is that a federal guarantee of the city 's notes might make them more attractive to investors than U.S. Treasury notes . They ask : Why should investors buy Treasury notes , which are not tax exempt , when they could buy city notes that are tax exempt and that also would have the backing of the U.S. Government ? They argue , too , that other U.S. cities would soon follow New York 's lead and seek backing for their own securities . On Wednesday ( Oct. 8 ) , Federal Reserve Board chairman Arthur F. Burns told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that help for New York should come from Congress . During the course of his testimony before the . JEC , Mr. Burns softened somewhat his earlier opposition to federal intervention in behalf of the city . Mayor Beame has not stopped calling for help , though . He appealed this week to the American Bankers Association , which has a powerful lobbying voice in Washington , to use its influence in getting federal aid for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting here that West Germany 's Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and other European economists are concerned that a default by New York City would have a " domino effect " on banks in other countries . Gov . Hugh L. Carey and other top state officials gave the ABA bankers a similar warning Tuesday ( Oct. 7 ) . By a 2-to-1 margin , though , the bankers indicated in a poll that the federal government should retain its " hands off " attitude .
