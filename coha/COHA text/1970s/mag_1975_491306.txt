The greatest social leveler in the whole world has to be a stopped-up john ( water closet , toilet or bathroom convenience , by whatever name it is known in your house ) . When it has problems , the greatest man in a woman 's life becomes your family plumber , second only perhaps to your family physician . I began frantically thumbing through my private address book , which resembles the Manhattan phone book in size and is a cross between the city dump and the paper reclamation center in content . My address book is filled with lots of papers , food coupons , and phone numbers jotted on cocktail napkins , which unfortunately are not connected with names that I can recall , plus other worthless trivia . As the water was still on the rise , 1 caught a glimpse , halfway down the page , of the name George Wallace , Plumbing Contractor in Royal Oak , Michigan . Beneath it was the name Governor George Wallace and Cornelia . Strange that these two men should be found side by side in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such diverse ways . One George Wallace has come to the aid of my backed-up septic system many times , but The Governor George Wallace may be the next President of the United States and may be just what this country needs to flush out its deep-rooted problems . George Wallace became governor the first time in January 1963 , and in 1964 he ran for president . In 1967 , his first wife , Lurleen , succeeded him as governor , and Wallace ran for the presidency in 1968 . He was defeated , but the campaign announced to the world that this man was to be taken seriously , and his determination to remain out front was now clearly visible to the skeptics like Edward Kennedy , Robert Strauss , and Richard Nixon . Returning to his home state , he won a second gubernatorial term in 1970 , taking office in 1971 , and hit the trail for the presidency again in 1972 . Many of the people who were drawn to this unusual man in his pursuit of the White House are still there working in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the acid pursuit of many politicians to beat a fallen President to death , plus the leap off the bandwagon by many Republicans ( it was so rapid that it resembled fleas off a newly washed dog ) , left a widespread disenchantment with the whole damn political mess in Washington . With the widespread distrust of both established political institutions , most of the polls show George Wallace ' way out front as an independent candidate who fills the bill . So move over , world ; George , the working man 's friend , is a worthy contender for the Democratic nomination , and from the re sults of a study done this year by the University of Michigan , he leads the pack . There was speculation that Teddy Kennedy might ask George Wallace to be his vice-presidential running mate in 1976 ; but knowing George Wallace , I would say he does n't have to play second fiddle to anyone and certainly not to anyone who viewed George Wallace as a small-time judge who happened to become Governor of a very Southern state with very Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not run , this bit of speculation has removed itself from the political scene . With seventeen campaigns for various political offices behind him , he is indeed a seasoned campaigner and has been out there hustling votes since his discharge from the Air Force in 1945 . But besides getting the votes , he listens to the people and changes as they change . He is an astute student of human nature and realizes nothing in this world remains unchanged . There is no denying his past stands on the subject of segregation  --  such as banning a black band from the inaugural parade . It was not his idea , but he was the boss and stepped up and took the blame because it happened and was later reported in the New York Times . He stood against the integration of the University of Alabama in June of 1963 because he felt the people who elected him felt this way . George never picked the issue of racial integration . The majority of his supporters wanted their schools segregated . George carried many predominantly black districts in this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Montgomery lawyer who wrote Wallace 's speech that echoed the theme : segregation today , tomorrow , forever , has now parted company ; and some say it is because George Wallace has changed his views on segregation . Others hint that Kohn did not approve of all the Governor 's close associates . Kohn is an old Southern gentleman , of the first water , and perhaps can not change ; but he is a believer in good and fair but separate treatment of the races . Has George Corley Wallace really changed his view on the American Black Man ? Frankly , George Wallace was never a bigot . He once quite honestly believed that it was better for both whites and blacks that they have separate but equal opportunity and living situations . Many people , in both the North and the South , both black and white , believe that this is a proper manner in which to live , providing there is complete equality and fairness in job opportunities , educations , and availability of housing . Reporters in the liberal , usually Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate lifestyles with the ideology of the KKK . I choose to beTHE // lieve that Governor Wallace has decided that all men and women should be judged individually by their abilities , not by their pigmentations . Governor Wallace has appointed more blacks to boards and commissions than all the other governors in the history of Alabama concerned . As vacancies occur , Governor Wallace is tilling them , where possible , with black members . These have included blacks from all walks of life . Wallace 's attitude toward blacks is demonstrated by many recent facts . He has attended ceremonies at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church , home church of the late Dr. Martin Luther King , received Mrs. Rosa Parks and Fred Gray , attorney for the boycotters , in his office , crowned the black homecoming queen at the University of Alabama , and taken part in many black events . He received more than 83 percent of the vote in the November general election against his opponents . In one county , predominantly black , Governor Wallace received almost 97 percent of the vote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every citizen of Alabama of every creed , color , nationality and race . And I am the governor to each of them as I am to any of the others . " There is presently a suit against the highway patrol which bothers the Governor , as it will take a long time for it to be solved for the long-range benefit of all the state 's people . The resulting court order calls for the employment of one black trooper for every white trooper until a 25 percent quota of personnel is reached . ( This suit was filed by Morris Dees , attorney of the Southern Poverty Law Center , which he organized . Dees was the national direct mail fund raiser for McGovern in 1972 and now supports Governor Jimmy Carter . ) Governor Wallace is anxious and willing to hire qualified blacks as state troopers . Alabama already has more black troopers than any otherstate in the South and most of the other states in the nation . Every effort is being made to comply with the court orders in this respect . A major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for qualified blacks from federal government and private industry where pay scales are higher and benefits greater . Since the court order was issued , Alabama has employed forty-four black troopers in comparison with only thirty white troopers . Efforts are continuing to recruit black troopers each day to comply with federal court order . In non-support personnel such as clerks , secretaries , etc. , the department has attained 24 percent of the required 25 percent quota . Blacks who filed the suit have asked for the lowering of employment standards so that the process can be speeded up in employment of troopers . However , E.C . Dothard , director of the department , explained that black applicants are accepted or rejected on the same basis as white applicants . He says he is convinced the court quota plan will be met in the near future because of the open invitation to all blacks to join the patrol on the same qualifications as those who now belong to the state patrol . " We have instructions from Governor Wallace to comply in every way with the court order and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe our recruiting drive will be successful as more young blacks with qualifications are coming along every day from schools and colleges and special training . We want these people as career troopers , and we work with all groups to recruit and train them . " It was May , the sun was warm , but it had been raining and the plans for George Wallace to be in the Laurel Fairgrounds in Maryland had to be changed , as the open field where the rally had been planned was muck and mire . There was also the residue of a departing circus ; it would not dofor a presidential candidate to trip over the droppings of an elephant , and the smell was n't all that great either . Just the day before , the bulletproof podium which is used by many public officials was dropped and broken . The Secret Service had forbidden Wallace to make an appearance anywhere until the repairs were made . The pressure of the local vote getters and campaign workers , coupled with his own determination not to let down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blacksmith to weld the podium back together . The day just started off all wrong . Cornelia had been busy that morning cleaning up the airplane , as the pilot had overslept and die paper plates , plastic spoons and forks and soft-drink cups were still there from the previous day 's trip . She made sure that soft drinks and catsup were aboard and shortly after , a very embarrassed pilot arrived and the Governor 's party climbed aboard and arrived in Maryland . Soon after the Governor 's car pulled up , the blacksmith arrived and unloaded the bulletproof podium from his pickup truck . The stage was set  --  the crowd was excited , the cheers were happy ones , but the Southern Governor was about to take the last step in his life . He gave a fairly short speech to explain his ideas on returning the government to the people ; certainly nothing he said could have enraged or brought forth the violence that followed . To George Wallace , the touch of the outstretched hands , the pats on the back , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he thrives on communication on a one-to-one basis . To be with the crowd is to be alive  --  but in this case , it was the touch of death , as the outstretched palm of Arthur Bremer held a gun which blew a hole through this presidential candidate . George said , " Dollie , from the time I hit the ground , I knew the numbness in my legs meant my life would be spent in a wheelchair , if God saw fit to spare me the pain of death . My faith in God never changed . . . " Cornelia Wallace , fearing that more than one man with a gun was there , wheeled around and threw her body across her bleeding husband 's chest , thus offering her life to protect his . What followed that fateful day in the shopping center in Laurel , Maryland has been two years of pain , private misery , eleven operations , and a constant fight against infection . Weakened by such an ordeal , the very soul of Wallace was close to despair . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for life and gregarious personality he was known to have in the days before the shooting . Other men have equaled the 140 days spent in various hospitals and others have cried out in constant pain , but these men did n't want to be president of the United States . Typical of the spirit of George C. Wallace , he faced his ordeal with realism . He called upon his faith in God and met the hard-to-face truth again that he would never walk . He set forth on an exercise program that would put Bear Bryant 's quarterbacks to shame . Up at dawn , he joins Cornelia for breakfast and spends several hours lifting weights , walking with lead-heavy braces between parallel bars , and no paraplegic could be more determined to maintain muscle tone and to build up the still functioning muscles in his body . With the return of his physical health , his attitude toward his paralysis amazed his doctors and his close friends . In my estimation , Cornelia Wallace had a great deal to do with his remarkable recovery ; as one friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great lady . " By personal observation , I will tell you she is intelligent and articulate and comes by her independence rightfully . Her uncle " Kissin ' Jim Folsom , " a former Alabama governor , was a legend in his own time ( 1947 to 1951 , 1955 to 1959 ) . He was defeated by George Wallace . Uncle Jimthought Cornelia was something special . Born Cornelia Ellis , on January 28 , 1939 , in Elba , Coffee County , Alabama , Cornelia was always actively engaged in politics . In high school she was the church organist , a majorette , cheerleader and runner-up in a Miss Alabama contest . In college she majored in voice and music ( she plays the saxophone , piano , organ and guitar ) . She became a professional folk singer and toured Australia with Grand Ole Opry star Roy Acuff . She composed songs  --  two of them were recorded by MGM records . She was in summer stock in New York , has been a professional water skier at Cypress Gardens , Florida . She was married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Joshua , now eleven and ten . Cornelia still water skis , sings and often plays guitar duets with George Wallace , Jr .... living at the mansion . Cornelia also plays tennis on a court on the mansion grounds . Cornelia is frank and honest in her responses to friends and journalists but rarely tells of the good works she personally is responsible for in Alabama . She started the mobile units that checked 17,000 Alabama women for cancer . She is personally involved with the mentally retarded that meet for an Easter egg hunt each year on the mansion grounds . She is never far away from her husband 's side and fusses with his tie if it 's not right , as any loving wife has a tendency to do . She runs her household with delight and good humor and loves to have friends in . Her relationship with her two sons by a previous marriage is close , and with Lurleen Wallace 's daughter Lee there is love and understanding of teenage problems . Her foremost commitment is to her husband . When one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average American family dinner . The children are there . The Governor sits at the head of the table , Lee to her dad 's right next to George , Jr. ? Josh and Jim on the other side , and Cornelia . The fare is often chicken fried steak or hamburger steak , field peas ( a Southern dish ) , potatoes and , as always , lots of catsup . Each of the children says his own prayer aloud and visitors are invited to join in this family tradition if they wish . It 's a privilege to see the natural exchange of ideas and lack of stiff protocol often followed by state heads . Those closest to Charles S. Snider , who is the executive director of the Wallace campaign , say he is dedicated to running a campaign that is free from big influence and big money , as Wallace must go into office owing it only to the little , hardworking , tax-paying guy who knocks his brains out trying to cope with inflation , food costs and the latest sports headlines . The one- to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get ' Em . " Charlie said his books are open and his bills are paid , and if the Governor runs , he 'll be right there beside him asking for your help . Another close Wallace associate is Joe Azbel , a sort of PR man who edits the newsletter called The Wallace Stand that keeps the followers of George Wallace aware of his feelings on everything from booze to bread lines . Early in 1974 , Eugene McLain had announced his candidacy for the governorship , which was said by many to be a waste of time and money as no one could beat the man in the wheelchair , or , as some have called it , his chariot to the White House . McLain is a state Senator from Huntsville , in northern Alabama , where Wallace held only a slight edge . He 's a lawyer in his forties who found greener pastures in the pursuit of the development of shopping centers and amassed a fairly large fortune which he seemed willing to spend to defeat Wallace . Eugene McLain cried that the youth are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and welfare is getting out of hand . If this has a familiar ring , it 's because // it 's an economic problem in all states . It is true that the Alabama prison system is under a federal court order , the Alabama public school system is under federal court order and the mental health system is under federal court order . The last of these court orders calls for doctors , psychologists , nurses and aides on a basis of so many per patient . In compliance with the court order , Alabama has taken aggressive steps , but making up for shortages in qualified personnel will take time . Governor Wallace has been and is today a chief proponent of improved mental health programs , and he and his wife have been leaders in Alabama in this field . The Governor 's strong interest in this field is demonstrated by the fact that he has allocated a major portion of revenue sharing funds to mental health programs . To head this department ( mental health ) he named his number one administrator , Major General Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the State Mental Health Director . More than $160 million has been spent on mental-health care in the four-year period ending in 1974 . This is more than double the amount spent in the previous four years . There is also a federal court case against the Alabama Prison Commission , which administers the prison system of Alabama . The allocation of funds to the prison system is a matter for the Alabama Legislature to determine . Each year , funds have been increased and steps have been taken to upgrade Alabama prisons . A joint committee of the Alabama Legislature is studying the matter of upgrading prisons , and Governor Wallace has pledged his total cooperation . Every state is experiencing problems with prisons . Alabama has experienced less difficulty in this area than most states and is making progress in the area of pardon and parole and in prison rehabilitation programs , in which Governor Wallace has expressed deep interest . It might be pointed out that most of the personnel at the State Mansion are prison trustees . During the Wallace administration , an all-time record number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record is expected to be exceeded in the next Legislature . Governor Wallace has championed economic opportunity as a major step . Attending the various technical schools and colleges , created under the Wallace Junior College and Technical School Act , are thousands of blacks . This Wallace program is to provide education for every youngster in Alabama . It was Governor Wallace who created the free text-book program . As an example of his service to edu-cation , total appropriations for the 1973-74 school year are more than $500 million , which is a Continued on page 108 guide in America .

He wanders the streets of London alternately chasing his archenemy , Professor Moriarty , and sitting locked up in his Baker Street apartment , fearing the " air guns " of Moriarty . Watson begins to realize the seriousness of Holmes 's delusions when Professor Moriarty visits him and reveals his true , harmless nature . Watson resolves that he must get Holmes weaned from his addiction . After research , he learns of a Viennese doctor who can cure people of the need for cocaine  --  Sigmund Freud . By a series of ruses , Watson leads Holmes to the great psychoanalyst 's Vienna lair on the pretext of following Professor Moriarty . Once there , Holmes goes through the torments of the damned trying to shake the addiction .

The book definitely is flawed , especially as a portrait of Sigmund Freud . Also , the plots which Holmes , Freud , and Watson untangle are both farfetched and rather simple by comparison with the Conan Doyle originals . On the other hand , the book is rich in the atmospherics which make up the most important part of the cozy detective story habitat . Meyer has managed to reproduce with startling similarity the narrative patterns of speech of the good Doctor Watson as relayed by Doyle . He has found exactly the right note of familiarity , dependency , and condescension in the relationship between Holmes and Watson and has played it faithfully . And he has managed to revive Holmes in all his misery and glory so that he can hardly be told from the original .

" Not long after I was born , the dark Depression days were setting in , and the struggle for survival for any Alabama farm family was a hard one . Everybody had to do his bit to help ends meet . I picked berries and sold them for ten cents a gallon and picked pecans on halves ; every penny had to help the family income . " As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a mule and drove an ox team . " From the older people who talked to me about Wallace , I learned that even as a youngster Wallace showed signs of having the restless energy which was to come in handy as he worked to become a leader of his state and a nationally known spokesman for states ' rights , constitutional government , free enterprise and individual liberty and freedoms . His family recalls that his baby naps were short and infrequent and he was constantly " doing something " to keep busy . That " doing something " sometimes got him into hot water with his family . Once , while still living in Clio , Wallace climbed the town 's water tower " just to see what it was like . " For all his trouble , he remembers he got a good view of the town and a seatof-the-britches paddling . During his school days , both at Clio Elementary School and at Barbour County High School , he learned to play and work hard . He was known as an " excellent student , popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wallace continued to perform his farm chores , but , when time permitted , he liked to swim and take part in other sports . Being quick , smart and nervy earned him a spot on the Barbour County High School football team . Former teammates remember young Wallace as a ninety-six-pounder who was the brain of the team but who let the other fellow score . It was in high school that he became " more interested " in boxing . Keen competition gave him a way to work off his excess energy and twice led him to the State Golden Gloves bantamweight boxing championship . Winning the boxing championship in 1936 and 1937 and quarterbacking the football team were not enough to consume the energy of the future Governor of Alabama . He was president of his high school senior class and served as Senate page in the 1935 State Legislature . As I asked him about his dad , he recalled that because of his father 's failing health , and to help his family financially , he became a door-to-door magazine salesman , often going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite often I would pick up extra change by boxing at ' smokers , ' as they were called in those days .

I had a few dollars in my pocket , and a burning determination to get a college education . " My father died in November of that year and mortgage holders foreclosed on all the Wallace farm property except the family home in Clio .

" One former college classmate recalled that George did n't " have any books or clothes ... well , I do n't suppose he had anything except brains , grit and guts .

His deep interest in history and law led him to leadership in the University Debating Society and later membership continued from page 114 War II Victory Medal . Though I thought it would be painful to talk about the shooting , I really wanted to know firsthand how this man lying here before me now looked back on the man who shot him . Is he bitter ? " No , Miss Dollie  --  not bitter  --  but it 's hard to believe one man could hate another so much that , even though he did n't know him , he could try and take his life .

I have questions in my mind about how he got the money . Where could he have picked up the cash to get along ? " His published diaries show he followed me for some time before he finally shot me . I 'm not accusing any particular group of plotting my assassination , but in my own mind I am not convinced that Bremer was a loner . I have great respect for the FBI , but in this case there are still too many unanswered questions . I have no evidence , but I think my attempted assassination was part of a conspiracy , and Arthur Bremer was given financial help .

The men , in true chauvinist fashion , were seated at a table above us , but Cornelia and I did n't mind , as we were fast involved in getting to know each other better . Of course I had to tell her of my first encounter with Miss Ruby , her outspoken and lovable mother , who I just happen to think is like a ray of sunshine in a dark room , as she is honest , open and completely herself at all times .

" " Oh , " she said . " My daughter , Cornelia , drove it last year . " " How do you do , Miss Ruby . My name is Dollie Cole and I met your son-in-law and daughter this afternoon , and I was impressed with your daughter 's concern and tenderness toward the Governor .

Cornelia jokes that she became a bride , a mother , and a grandmother all on the same day , which certainly makes the day easy to remember . As part of our conversation centered around love and family , Miss Ruby inquired if I had among my acquaintances any eligible middle-aged respectable single men , as they were scarce as hen 's teeth in Alabama , and she had been a widow for some time and was entertaining the thought of perhaps another alliance . Now I am not a practical joker but good , clean on-the-spot humor does appeal to me as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my eye I noticed Fred Hartley , president of Union Oil , standing by the swimming pool talking seriously with several gentlemen , including Bill France and George Wallace 's brother , a judge .

He 's single which is untrue , as Fred Hartley has a beautiful wife , owns a jet , and is president of an oil company , and a real swinger actually he 's very serious . " But I told Ruby he just works , works , works too hard and he needs a good woman at his side to guide him . Over we strolled , and I introduced Miss Ruby to the others , and each man gave her a hug and kiss until she came to Fred . She cradled his shoulders up close to her and said , " Land sakes , he 's just tiddy high .

Cornelia countered with other stories about her mother which are filled with down-home humor and truth , both of which the Folsom Ladies inherited along with their black hair and blue eyes . At the end of my last visit with George and Cornelia , I felt as one always does when one has been touched by history and those who make it . I would n't want to run against Governor Wallace , as he 's one hell of a fighter , and he does love Alabama and all its people . During our stay in Alabama , we had the privilege to visit Oakwood College at Huntsville , Alabama and meet with Victor Brooks , the Director of Community Relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students , who are 96 percent black , I asked him how he and others felt about Governor Wallace . He cited the fact that many politicians come and go in Alabama and spout off about what they are going to do for the black man , but when they get into office , they have a memory lapse . The Governor obeys the law of the land , and does what he says he 'll do . In politicians you ca n't beat that . During my interview with Mr. Brooks 's students there , I experienced a greater harmony between blacks and whites and felt that the hostility that I have seen so often on the black faces in Detroit and New York was here lacking . They were friendly , very bright and interested in a better world for all God 's people . Would n't it be great if the whole world had been born color blind ?
