SUMMER in Europe has become a rite of passage for American youth , the Woodstock of the ' 70s . Young vagabonds have always tripped out to Europe for the warm months , but there is something different about Exodus 1971 . Most of the new wanderers are not highly motivated students seeking culture or well-heeled dollar scions out to raise hell . They are generally the same bunch of kids who would normally have had summer jobs lifeguarding at the pool or dispensing hamburgers at MacDonald 's . Only this year few summer jobs are available for students . The unemployment rates top 15% for the 16-to-19 age group , and 9.9% for those aged 20 to 24 , the highest in seven and ten years , respectively . The youth fares have given students and recent graduates a fresh chance to get away from it all . <P> The new nomads travel light : a few old pullovers wadded into a knapsack and a few hundred dollars stuffed into their jeans . Many of the girls are unsupported by anything but their male companions . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most are rather aimlessly following crowds of their countrymen in a quest for good vibrations . They are joining millions of footloose European youths , who are wandering far and wide from Hammerfest to Gibraltar-and points even farther out . Whatever their mother tongue , the youngsters manage to communicate . They speak a sort ot Jeunesperanto , and they share much the same style of dress , penchant for folk music and smoking habits . <P> " Thousands of my friends are going , " observed ponytailed John Segall , 18. as he queued up to get his passport in New York . " No one will be left in the city this summer except the junkies who could n't rip off enough people to get the bread to go . " Said Conrad Young , 23 , as his plane circled London 's Heathrow Airport for a landing : " Maybe I 'll go to Switzerland . Or maybe Spain . Anyplace with lots of young people . Just follow the crowds . " <P> Old-fashioned hedonism remains an attraction . " I 'll roam until my book of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Viet Nam Veteran Steve Verich of Akron , Ohio , traveling in West Germany . " When I was in the jungle , I vowed that if I ever got out alive , I 'd spend a long time in Europe-drinking the local brand and making it with all the chicks until I got my fill . Then I 'd return home to do something constructive . But now my traveler 's checks are nearly gone , and I still have n't any notion of what I should do back home , or even who I really am.
