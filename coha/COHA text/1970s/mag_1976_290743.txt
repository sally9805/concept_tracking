For M. Millet , art is slavish copying of nature . He lights his lantern and goes looking for cretins. . . imagine a monster with no skull , the eye extinguished by an idiot 's squint , straddling in the middle of a field like a scarecrow . No spark of intelligence humanizes this resting brute . Has he been working or murdering ? <P> So ran one Paris critic 's response to Jean Franois Millet 's Man with a Hoe at the Salon of 1863 . And how the Second Empire 's fear of the collective poor is distilled in the last six words ! Proletarian labor , as a subject for art , was the invention of the 19th century ; for that , the country-bred Millet was largely responsible . Other paintings of his met similar critical obloquies : The Gleaners , 1857 , " have enormous pretensions-they pose like the three fates of pauperdom . " The Sower , 1850 , was greeted by one conservative as an insult to the dignity of work : " I regret that M. Millet so calumniates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faceless and inexplicably menacing colossus striding down the dark hill . <P> Yet before the century ended , these paintings , together with Millet 's Angelus , had become the most popular works of art in the new age of mass production , disseminated by millions of engravings , postcards , knickknacks and parodies . The Sower became the Mona Lisa of socialism , but it served capitalism equally well as the corporate emblem of its owners , the Provident National Bank in Philadelphia . <P> After the boom , slump . Millet had died in 1875 , having greatly influenced Gauguin , Czanne , Seurat , blue-period Picasso and especially Vincent Van Gogh . Later , modernism lost interest in images of rural labor ; they were derided as sentimental masscult . Millet sank from view , leaving behind one obdurate clich : The Angelus , in its tacky frame , on every parlor wall . <P> The Millet centenary exhibition , which began at the Grand Palais in Paris and is now at London 's Hayward Gallery , is a remarkable event . It consists of 147 paintings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art Historian Robert Herbert , who gives us one of the best readings of a 19th century artist to appear in a decade . What Herbert achieves is the restoration of a great lost painter whose images are central to any understanding of radical culture in France . <P> Millet was what Gustave Courbet pretended to be : the son of peasants . Born in 1814 , he spent most of his life in rural France . He was able to perceive the land and the labor it exacted from men as substance and process , not as a sight for a city-dwelling impressionist on an outing . Millet 's The Plain of Chailly , 1862 , was unlike virtually every previous landscape in Western art . It is neither a bird's-eye " world view " in the fashion of Bruegel nor a meditation on cosmic energy as in Turner . It is not " romantic . " Especially , it is not a vision of property , such as Rubens painted . What it offers is a numbing pressure of material substance . The plain stretches away under the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harrow and a plow . Nothing could be less picturesque .
