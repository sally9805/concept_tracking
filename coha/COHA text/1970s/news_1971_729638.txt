txt Mayor Lindsay led the pained reaction to the New York Giants ' planned move to New Jersey by attacking the team 's management as " selfish , callous and ungrateful " and pledging to fight to have both the New York Yankees and a professional football team in Yankee Stadium in 1975 . But other city officials were less sanguine , raising questions about the future of the Yankees , the stadium and the Bronx itself . While Mr. Lindsay was talking of " going ahead full speed " with city plans to buy and renovate the 48-year-old ball park , Controller Abraham D. Beame and City Council President Sanford D. Garelik were questioning whether the city should invest any money at all now that the Giants are moving . Robert Abrams , Bronx Borough President , whose office is only three blocks from the stadium , expressed worry that the baseball Yankees would follow the football Giants out of his borough . " The impact is tremendous , " he said . " What a loss ! This so very , very damaging to us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract people to the Bronx . " The Yankees ' management was noncommittal . Their president , Michael A. Burke , wished the Giants " good luck and godspeed , " then added : " We will simply have to wait and see what develops in the next few ( lays . It 's a whole new equation absent the Giants . My overriding concern remains the future of the Yankees . We shall now have to take a new and realistic reading of our options . " Mr. Burke has already said his club has two options other than staying in its stadium ? leaving town , perhaps for New Jersey , Texas or Canada , or sharing Shea Stadium in Queens with the New York Mets . MI- . Lindsay , w710 called a news conference after learning of the Giants ' plans , said he would try to make it as attractively as possible for the Yankees to stay . " The city , " he said , " will present to the City Council and Board of Eseimate a complete renovation plan and the terms of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 days . The Mayor also said that he would meet with Pete Rozelle , the National Football League commissioner , next week to begin a campaign to get a new N.F.L. team for Yankee Stadium . Standing with Mr. Lindsay was Lewis Rudin , president of the Association for a Better New York , a business group , who said the association would guarantee the financing for a new team . There was anger and threats in the Lindsay statement , and the threats involved action in Federal courts and the Congress to attack professional football 's partial exemption from antitrust laws if the league does not provide a new franchise for New York . " In taking this action , " Mr. Lindsay added , " the Giant management crossed the line that distinguishes a sport from a business . I am today directing the Corporation Counsel to initiate proceedings to restrict the right of the Giants to call themselves by the name of the city they have chosen to leave . An Appeal to Celler " Finally ; I have asked Chairman Emanuel Celler of the House Judiciary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relates directly to Congressman Celler 's concern when he fought against Congressional action giving profeassional football certain exemptions from Federal antitrust laws . " As the Mayor spoke , other city officials joked that the team could call itself the Jersey Giants or East Rutherford Giants . Mr. Abrams , who was not kidding , said the city should consider prohibiting the Giants from playing in New York while their new stadium was being built . " We made them a successful operation , now they want to leave , " he said . " If they want to play in a swamp , let them play in a swamp right now . " Mr. Abrams said that the economic impact of the Giants ' loss was hard to judge and that , perhaps , the real loss was psychological for a borough and city that has been losing less spectacular businesses for years . His , assessment was similar to one prepared by Preston Robert Tisch , president of the New York Convention and Business Bureau , who discussed the impact should Yankee Stadium close down : " The visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate loss , with them would go their business to hotels , restaurants , stores , entertainment and sightseeing attractions . Yankee Stadium 's neighborhood would be in danger of severe depression ? jobs would vanish , land values would plummet . " The area would be as cut off from the outside world as sections of Brooklyn were in 1957 when the Dodgers left . We could easily predict that New York City would be the loser by a minimum of $50-million a year from visitors alone if the Yankees should depart . " But while official indignation echoed ' the cries of 1957 when the Dodgers and baseball Giants left for the West Coast , the reaction of a random sampling of football fans was mixed . James Michael Haggerty , an air cargo executive who lives in Smithtown , L. I. , who described himself as a fanatic Giant fan , said : " I think it 's a good move . The Jersey stadium will be easier to reach from the island , and there wo n't be any pillars to obstruct the view . " Jet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Robert Nahas of Little Ferry , N. J. , not too far from the proposed stadium site . " But if the Giants moving to Jersey means I can get tickets , then I 'll go . Anyway , parking will be easier . " But a Bronx fan , Vincent Allen of 1750 Seminole Avenue , was unhappy . ' We 've stuck with them through thick and thin and now they wo n't he the New York Giants anymore , " he said . " Wellington Mara is nothing compared to his father . The old man was really for the people of New York . This guy is just out for the buck ? he would n't spend any money to get a good team in here . " Len Daniels of 2240 Hoffman Avenue , Elmont , L. I. , said : " I 'm terribly upset . . . In anticipation of their moving , I gave up my season ticket . From now on I 'm a Jets fan , and I 'll try to get Jet season tickets . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
