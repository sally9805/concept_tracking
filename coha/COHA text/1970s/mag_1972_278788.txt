FOR the next several years , Washington 's economic managers face a dismal three-way choice : raise taxes severely , slash federal spending brutally , or countenance rapid inflation . That is the hard conclusion of a major new study of federal finance by the Brookings Institution , the nation 's most prestigious private economic think tank . Release of the study last week immediately sharpened a basic campaign debate over the issues of how much social service Americans should expect from the Federal Government and how heavily they should be taxed to pay the bills . <P> At present tax rates , concluded a team of Brookings economists headed by former Budget Bureau Director Charles Schultze , the future spending increases built into current federal programs and those the Administration proposes now will lead to a budget deficit of $17 billion by fiscal 1975 . That will occur even if the economy is by then operating at full employment , which is usually defined as a jobless rate no higher than 4% . Large deficits can be tolerated when there is substantial slack in the economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be grossly inflationary . Not until fiscal 1977 , the Brookings scholars believe , will economic growth bring in enough tax revenue to yield a budget surplus of a relatively small $5 billion . Even that calculation assumes that the Government will start not a single new major spending program for the next four years . All by itself , however , the proposed 20% increase in Social Security benefits now being talked up in Congress could more than wipe out any potential surplus . <P> Though the report was prepared by mostly Democratic economists , the Nixon Administration voiced no disagreement with their mathematics . But it strongly disputed their policy conclusions . White House policymakers seized on the chance to make clear their choice among the available options . At a press conference called to rebut the Brookings study , Presidential Assistant John Ehrlichman painted this picture of Nixon 's policy during a potential second term : taxes will be held down , federal social spending will be slashed deeply , and the financial burden of many programs will in effect be shifted to states and cities . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases in federal taxation for the foreseeable future . " But , he added , " we reject as a declaration of bankruptcy " any idea that the Government can not cut spending enough to balance the budget at full employment. * The Administration has prepared a list of 110 social programs enacted under Lyndon Johnson 's Great Society that Ehrlichman called " fit for repeal . " He named only one : the $450 million-a-year Model Cities program of building showcase neighborhoods in blighted urban areas . Brookings estimated that the Great Society programs have increased federal spending by $34 billion a year . If such programs are to be continued , Ehrlichman implied , they will have to be financed by states and cities with money from Nixon 's proposed revenue-sharing plan .
