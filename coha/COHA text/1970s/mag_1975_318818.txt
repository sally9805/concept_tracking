Nostalgia flowers naturally in worried times , which makes other eras seem better . But the contemporary fascination with nostalgia also reflects a different kind of judgment on our age . There is a discontent with the present , a foreboding of a plastic future , a looking back with longing to times that were-what ? Simpler , happier , better ? But were those times really better ? The corny old movies , the Art Deco shapes , are now seen not critically but fondly , as shards and artifacts of times that were more sharply defined than ours ( the Roaring Twenties , the Gay Nineties ) . Since such a view of the past is apt to be indulgent and sentimental , the nostalgia wave is hardly a fair test of past or present . A better test would be : When was the best time for most Americans to have been alive ? <P> That is much different from asking when was the best time to have been among the rich , to have had plenty of servants , private railway cars and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richer earlier , when taxes were much lower , before there were so many other claimants to the best of everything . But when were the times best for most people ? <P> Some periods are easily rejected . The Civil War , with the best of American youth dying fratricidally in the valleys of Virginia , goes out immediately ; so does that war 's ugly aftermath , the Reconstruction . But out , too , go the romantic Gay Nineties , when in reality Europe 's " huddled masses yearning to breathe free " were pouring through Ellis Island 's gates to clot the cities and the mill towns or to be herded into overcrowded tenements , where the only toilets were fetid sheds out in the dark alleys . <P> No , for most people the best time to have been alive in the U.S. has to be earlier than the last half of the 19th century . Or else later . <P> " America was promises , " Archibald MacLeish once sang . Those promises were easier to keep before the American invitation was issued wholesale all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . So consider as one candidate for the best of American tunes those earlier years before the Civil War , when the Republic was agrarian . The existence of slavery counts against that time , but in the Republic 's first days even many Southerners regarded slavery as " scaffolding " to be removed when the building of nationhood was complete . <P> Nine out of ten Americans lived on farms , grew their own corn and potatoes , made most of their own clothes . In the not-yet-crowded countryside and seashore , the woods were full of wild game and the waters of cod , carp , shad and salmon . Life was tough and dangerous but self-sufficient . What now seems amaz ing about this hardy era was the immense national feeling of self-confidence-the feeling , summed up in the phrase still imprinted on the back of every dollar bill , that America was a " new order of the ages .
