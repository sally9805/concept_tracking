During a trial run , the mailboy missed a turn and went crashing through a men 's room door . Now he has a regular office job-delivering and picking up letters on the 49th floor of Chicago 's 110-story Sears Tower-and should do much better . He will probably never bump into anyone or anything , never pause for idle chatter or flirtation , or stop for more than 42 seconds at any one desk - indeed , never veer from any of his appointed rounds . If his fellow Sears employees find this paragon irritatingly inhuman , they can be excused . For the methodical new mailboy is a robot . <P> Beeping Sound . The dream mailboy is a completely automated cart with 20 mail compartments . It runs on four rubber wheels and is driven by a battery-powered electric motor . Electrical sensors in the cart pick up low-frequency radio signals from wires that are strung under the carpets along the desired route . Following their path , the 500-lb. robot stops when its photoelectric sensing system picks up signal lights bounced off reflective tiles strategically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stop is out of a secretary 's line of sight , the robot sounds a chime or blinks a light to attract her attention . <P> As it wends its way around the floor at about one mile per hour , the mailboy emits a soft beeping sound and a low-intensity blue light to alert unwary humans . If these warnings are ignored , infra-red sensors inform the robot when it is four inches away from a leg or a misplaced piece of furniture , and it comes to a stop after moving only another inch . <P> When the obstacle is removed , the mailboy immediately resumes its travels . <P> The manufacturer of this mechanical wizard , Detroit 's Jervis B. Webb Co. , has had long experience making such automatons . One device , designed for carting material around trade shows and conventions , actually says " Pardon me " ( in a recorded male voice ) . Webb 's most sophisticated installation is at Detroit 's 650-bed Harper-Webber Hospital . There , 70 automated , self-propelled carts recently began doing everything from delivering meals and surgical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the spread of germs from one area of the hospital to another , the carts are programmed to return directly to an automatic sterilizing " carwash " after each delivery or pickup .
