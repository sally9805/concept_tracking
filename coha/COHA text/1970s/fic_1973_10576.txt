was far from willing to offer me service . From which I guessed that she had told him nothing about her hopes for the future . " All right , we 'll leave that for the moment . But it seems that somebody wants to harm you , whoever it may be . If those men this morning were n't just roadside cutthroats , it would help to know who they were , and who paid them . Have you no idea who they might have been ? " " No , " still mumbling . " It 's of some interest to me , " I said mildly . " They might conceivably want to kill me , too . " That startled him out of his resentment . " Why ? " " If you were attacked out of revenge for the part you played at Tintagel , then presumably they will attack me as well . If you were attacked for the message you carried to me , I want to know why . If they were plain thieves , which seems the most likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must get a message to the troopers down at the barracks . " " Oh . Yes , I see . " He looked disconcerted and slightly ashamed . " But it 's true , my lord ; I do n't know who they were . I  --  it was of interest to me , too . I 've been trying to think , all this time , but I 've no idea . There 's no clue that I can remember . They did n't wear badges ; at least I do n't think so . . . " His brows drew together , painfully . " I 'd have noticed badges , surely , if they 'd had them ? " " How were they dressed ? " " I  --  I hardly noticed . Leather tunics , I think , and chainmailcaps . No shields , but swords and daggers . " " And they were well mounted . I saw that . Did you hear their speech ? " " Not that I remember . They hardly spoke , a shout or two , that was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from . I 'm not good at accents . " 40 " There was nothing you can think of that might have marked them for King 's men ? " This was probing too near the wound . He went scarlet , but said levelly enough : " Nothing . But is it likely ? " " I would n't have thought so , " I said . " But kings are queer cattle , and queerest of all when they have bad consciences . Well , then , Cornishmen ? " The flush had ebbed , leaving him if possible more sickly pale than before . His eyes were sullen and unhappy . This was the wound itself ; this was a thought he had lived with . " Duke 's men , you mean ? " " They told me before I left Dimilioc that the King was to confirm young Cador as Duke of Cornwall . That 's one man , Ralf , who will have no love for you . He wo n't stop to considerthat you were the Duchess 's man , and were serving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it might extend to vengeance . One could hardly blame him if it did . " He looked faintly surprised , then in some odd way set at case by this dispassionate handling . After a bit he said , with an attempt at the same tone : " They might have been Cador 's men , I suppose . There was nothing to show it , one way or the other . Maybe I 'll remember something . " He paused . " But surely , if Cador intended to kill me , he could have cut me down in Cornwall . Why come all the way here ? To follow inc to you ? He must hate you as much . " " More , " I said . " But if he had intended to kill me , he knew where to find me ; the whole world knows that . And he 'd have come before this . " He eyed me doubtfully . Then he appeared to find anexplanation for my apparent lack of fear . " I suppose no onewould dare come after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It would be nice to think so , " I agreed . There was nopoint in telling him how thin my defenses were . " Now , 41that 's enough for the moment . Rest again , and you 'll find you feel better tomorrow . Will you sleep , do you think ? Are you in pain ? " " No , " he said , not truthfully . Pain was a weakness he would not admit to me . I stooped and felt for the heartbeatin his wrist . It was strong and even . I let the wrist drop , and nodded at him . " You 'll live . Call me in the night if you want me . Good night . " Ralf did not in fact remember anything more next morning that would give a clue to the identity of his attackers , and I forbore for a few days from questioning him further about the contents of Marcia 's letter . Then one evening , when I judged he was better , I called him to me . It had been a damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , so I had lit a fire , and sat with my supper beside it . " Ralf , bring your bowl and eat beside me where it 's warm . I want to talk to you . " He came obediently . He had somehow managed to mend and tidy his clothes , and now , with the cuts and bruises fading , and with colour back in his face , he was almost himselfagain , except for a limp where the wound on his hip had not yet mended ; and except , still , for his silence , and the sullen shadow of wariness in his face . He limped across and sat where I pointed . " You said you knew what else was in your grandmother 's letter to me besides news of the Queen ? " I asked him . " Yes . " " Then you know she sent you to take service with me , because she feared the King 's displeasure . Did the King himself give you any reason to fear him ? " A slight shake of the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fear him , no . But when the alarm came of a Saxon landing on the south coast , and I asked to ride with his men , 42he would not take me . " His voice was sullen and furious . " Even though he took every other Cornishman who had fought against him at Dimilioc . But myself , who had helped him , he dismissed . " I looked thoughtfully at the bent head , the hot averted cheek . This , of course , was the reason for his attitude to me , the wary resentment and anger . He could only see , understandablyenough , that through his service to me and the King he had lost his place near the Queen ; worse , he had incurred his Duke 's anger , had been disgraced as a Cornish subject and banished from his home to a kind of service he disdained . I said : " Your grandmother tells me little except that she feels you had better seek a career for yourself outside Cornwall . Leave that for a moment ; you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But tell me , did the King ever say anything to you directly about the night of Gorlois ' death ? " A pause , so long that I thought he would not answer . Then he said : " Yes . He told me that I had served him well , and he  --  he thanked me . He asked me if I wanted a reward . I said no , the service was reward enough . He did n't like that . I think he wanted to give me money , and requite me , and forget it . He said then that I could no longer serve him or the Queen . That in serving him I had betrayed my master the Duke , and that a man who had betrayed one master could betray another . " " Well ? " I said . " Is that all ? " " All ? " His head jerked up at that . He looked startled and contemptuous . " All ? An insult like that ? And it was a lie , you know it was ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I did not betray the Duke ! " " Oh , yes , it was an insult . You ca n't expect the King to be level-headed yet , when he himself feels as guilty as Judas. 43He 's got to put the betrayal on someone 's shoulders , so it 's yours and mine . But I doubt if you 're in actual danger from him . Even a doting grandmother could hardly call that a threat . " " Who was talking about threats ? " said Ralf hotly . " I did n't come away because I was afraid ! Someone had to bring the message , and you saw how safe that was ! " It was hardly the tone a servant uses . I hid my amusement and said mildly : " Do n't ruffle your feathers at me , young cockerel . No one doubts your courage . I 'm sure the King does not . Now , tell me about this Saxon landing . Where ? What happened ? I 've had no news from the south for over a month now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was in May . They landed south of Vindocladia . There 's a deep bay there , they call it Potters ' Bay . I forget its real name . Well , it 's outside federated territory , in Dumnonia , and that was against all the agreements the Federates made . You would know that . " I nodded . It is hard to remember now , looking back down the years to the time I write of , Uther 's time , that today men hardly remember even the name of Federate . The first of the Federated Saxons were the followers of Hengist and Horsa , who had been called in by King Vortigern as mercenaryhelp to establish him on his stolen throne . When the fighting was done , and the rightful princes Ambrosius and Uther had fled to Brittany , the usurper Vortigern would have dismissed his Saxon mercenaries ; but they refused to withdraw , demanding territory where they could settle , and promising , as federated settlers , to fight as Vortigern 's allies . So , partly because he dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might need them again , Vortigern gave them the coastal stretches in the south , from Rutupiae to Vindocladia  --  the stretch that was called the Saxon Shore. 44In the days of the Romans it had been so called because the main Saxon landings had been there ; by Uther 's time the name had taken on a direr and truer significance . On a clear day you could see the Saxon smoke from London Wall . It had been from this secured base , and from similar enclavesin the north-east , that the new attacks had come when my father was King . He had killed Hengist and his brother , and had driven the invaders back , some northwards into the wild lands beyond Hadrian 's Wall , and others behind their old boundaries , where once again  --  but this time forcibly  --  they had been bound by treaty . But a treaty with a Saxon is like writing in water : Ambrosius , not trusting to the prescribed boundaries , had thrown up a wall to protect the rich lands which marched with the Saxon Shore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had held them , nor had they openly joined in the attacks led by Hengist 's son Octa and Rosa his kinsman in the early days of Uther 's reign ; but they were uneasy neighbours : they provided a beach-head for any wandering longships , and the Saxon Shore grew crowded and still more crowded , till even Ambrosius ' Wall looked frail protection . And everywhere along the eastern shores raiders came in from the German Sea , some to burn and rape and sail again , others to burn and rape and stay , buying or extortingnew territory from the local kings . Such an attack , now , Ralf was describing to me . " Well , of course the Federates broke the agreement . A new war-band  --  thirty ships it was  --  landed in Potters ' Bay , well west of the boundary , and the Federates welcomed them and came out in force to help them . They established a beach-head near the river 's mouth and started to push up towards Vindocladia . I think if they had once got to Badon I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring at me . There was amazement in his lace , and a touch of fear. 45 " Nothing , " I said . " I thought I heard something outside , but it 's only the wind . " He said slowly : " You looked for a moment the way you did that night at Tintagel , when you said the air was full of magic . Your eyes went strange , all black and blurred , as if you were seeing something , out there beyond the fire . " He hesitated . " Was it prophecy ? " " No . I saw nothing . All I heard was a sound like horses galloping . It was only the wild geese going over in the wind . If it was prophecy , it will come again . Go on . You were speaking of Badon Hill . " " Well , the Saxons ca n't have known that King Uther was in Cornwall , with all the force he 'd brought down to fight Duke Gorlois . He gathered his army and called on the Dumnoniansto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He paused , compressing his lips , then finished briefly : " Cador went with him . " " Did he indeed ? " I was thoughtful . " You did n't happen to hear what had passed between them ? " " Only that Cador had been heard to say that since he could n't defend his part of Dumnonia alone he did n't mind fighting alongside the Devil himself , as long as the Saxons could be cleared from the coast . " " He sounds a sensible young man . " Ralf , hot on his grievance , was not listening . " You see , he did n't exactly make peace with Uther  --  " " Yes . One gathers that . " "  --  but he did march with him ! And I could not ! I went to him , and to my lady , and begged to go , but he would n't take me ! " " Well , " I said , reasonably , " how could he ? " That stopped him . He stared at me , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you think me a traitor  --  " " You 're the same age as Cador , are n't you ? Then try toshow as much common sense . Think . If Cador was to go into battle beside the King , then the King , for your sake , could hardly take you . Uther may suffer a few pangs of conscience when he lays eyes on you , but Cador must see you as one of the causes of his father 's death . Do you think he would bear you near him , however much he may need the King and his legions ? Now do you see why you were left at home , and then sent north to me ? " He was silent . I said , gently : " What 's done is done , Ralf . Only a child expects life to be just ; it 's a man 's part to stand by the consequence of his deeds . As we both shall , believe me . So put all this behind you , and take what the gods send . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court , or even because you have had to leave Cornwall . " There was a longer silence . Then he picked up his empty bowl and mine and got to his feet . " Yes , I see . Well , since for the moment I ca n't do much else , I 'll stay and serve you . But not because I 'm afraid of the King , or because my grandmotherwants to get me out of Duke Cador 's way . It 's because I choose . And indeed "  --  he swallowed  --  " I reckon I owe it to you . " His tone was neither grateful nor conciliatory . He stood there like a soldier , stiffly , the bowls clutched to his ribs . " Then start paying your debt and wash the supper dishes , " I said equably , and picked up a book . He hung on his heel a moment , but I neither spoke nor looked up . He went then , without another word , to draw water from the spring outside. 5Bruises on the young heal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insistent that he no longer needed doctoring . The wound on his hip , however , gave some trouble , and left him limping for a week or two . In " choosing " to stay with me , he had made the best of a bad job , since for the time being he was tied to the cave by his injury and by the loss of his horse , but he served me well , mastering what resentment he might yet feel towards me and his new position . He was silent still , but this suited me , and I went quietly about my affairs , while Ralf gradually fell into my ways , and we got along tolerably well together . Whatever he thought of my quarters in the cave , and the menial tasks which between us we had to do , he made it clear that he was a page serving a prince . Somehow , through the days that followed , I found myself relieved , bit by bit , of burdensome work which I had begun to take for granted ; I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicines , even to make music . It was strange at first , and then in some way comforting , to lie wakeful in the night and hear the boy 's untroubled breathing from the other side of the cave . After a while , I found I was sleeping better ; as the nightmares receded , strength and calmness came back ; and if power still withheld itself , I no longer despaired of its return . As for Ralf , though I could see that he still fretted against48his exile  --  to which , of course , he could see no clear end  --  he was never less than courteous , and as time went on seemed to accept his banishment with a better grace , and either lost or hid his unhappiness in a kind of contentment . So the weeks went by , and the valley fields yellowed towards harvest , and the message came at last from Tintagel . One evening in August , towards dusk , a messenger came spurring up the valley . Ralf was not with me . I had sent him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Abba , lived all summer . I had been treating Abba 's son Ban , who was simple , for a poisoned foot ; this was almost healed , but still needed salves . I went out to meet the messenger . He had dismounted below the cliff , and now clambered up to the flat alp in front of the cave . He was a young man , spruce and lively , and his horse was fresh . I guessed from this that his message vas not urgent ; he had taken his time , and come at his ease . I saw him take in my ragged robe and threadbare mantle in one swift , summing glance , but he doffed his cap and went on one knee . I wondered if the salute was for the enchanter , or for the King 's son . " My lord Merlin . " " You are welcome , " I said . " From Tintagel ? " " Yes , sir . From the Queen . " A quick upward glance . " I came privily , without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or you would have borne her badge . ( yet up , man . The grass is damp . Have you had supper ? " He looked surprised . It was not thus , I reckoned , that most princes received their messengers . " Why , no , sir , but I bespoke it at the inn . " " Then I wo n't keep you from it . I 've no doubt it will be better than you 'd get here . Well then , your business ? You 've brought a letter from the Queen ? " 49 " No letter , sir , just the message that the Queen desires to see you . " " Now ? " I asked sharply . " Is there anything wrong with her , or with the child she bears ? " " Nothing . The doctors and the women say that all is well . But "  --  he dropped his eyes  --  " it seems she has that on her mind which makes her want to talk with you . As soon as possible , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my voice as carefully neutral as his : " Where is the King ? " " The King plans to leave Tintagel in the second week of September . " " Ah . So any time after that it will be possible ' for me to see the Queen . " This was rather more frank than he cared for . He flashed me a glance , then looked at the ground again . " The Queen will be pleased to receive you then . She has bidden me make arrangements for you . You will understand that it will not do for you to be received openly in the castle of Tintagel . " Then , in a burst of candour : " You must know , my lord , there is no man 's hand in Cornwall but will be against you . It would be better if you came disguised . " " As for that , " I said , fingering my beard , " you will see that I 'm half disguised already . Do n't worry , man , I understand ; I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gave no reason for this summons ? " " None , my lord . " " And you heard nothing  --  no gossip from among the women , things like that ? " He shook his head , then , at the look in my face , added quickly : " My lord , she was urgent . She did not say so , but it must concern the child , what else ? " " Then I will come . " I thought he looked shocked . As he lowered his eyes , I said , sharply : " Well , what did you 50 expect ? I am not the Queen 's man . No , nor the King 's either , so there 's no need to look scared . " " Whose , then ? " " My own , and God 's . But you can go back to the Queen and tell her I will come . What arrangements have you made for me ? " He hurried , relieved , on to his own ground . " There is a small inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley about five miles from Tintagel . It is kept by a man called Caw . He is a Cornishman , but his wife Maeve was one of the Queen 's women , and he will keep his counsel . You can stay there without fear ; they will expect you . You may send messages to Tintagel , if you will , by one of Maeve 's sonsitwould not be wise to go near the castle until the Queen sends for you . Now for the journey . The weather should still be fine in mid-September , and the seas are usually calm enough , so  --  " " If you are about to advise me that it is easier to go by sea , you 're wasting your breath , " I said . " Has no one ever told you that enchanters ca n't cross water ? At least , not with any comfort . I should be seasick did I so much as cross the Severn River in the ferry . No , I go by road . " " But the main road takes you past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then the bridge at Glevum is guarded by King 's troops . " " Very well . I 'll take the river crossing , but make it a short one . " I knew that he was right . To go by the main road through Caerleon and then by the Glevum Bridge would , even without the prospect of discovery by Uther 's troops , put several days on my journey . " I 'll avoid the military road . There 's a good track along the coast through Nidum ; I 'll go that way , if you can bespeak me a boat at the mouth of the Ely River ? " " Very well , my lord . " And so it was arranged . I would5 ' a good warrior , as a man would have to be to keep that country in the wake of the great Magnus Maximus. j Another descendant of Cunedda still held the Votadini country : a young king , Lot , as fierce and as good a fighter as Maelgon ; his fortress lay near the coast south of Caer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was he who had faced and beaten off the latest attack of the Angles . I Ic had been given his command by Ambrosius , in the hope that with him the kings of the north  --  Gwalawg of Elmet , ' Urien of Gore , the chiefs of Strathclyde , King Coel of Rheged  --  would form a strong wall in the north and east . But Lot , it was said , was ambitious and quarrelsome ; and Strathclyde had sired nine sons already and ( while they fought like young bull seals each for his square of territory ) was cheerfully siring more . Urien of Gore had married Lot 's sister and would stand firm , but was , it was said , too close in Lot 's shadow . The strongest of then was still ( as in my father 's time ) Coel of Rheged , who held with a light hand all the smaller chiefs and earls of his kingdom , and brought them together faithfully against the smallest threat to the sovereignty of the High Kingdom . Now , the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Ector of Galava and Ban of Benoic , had joined with I.ot and Urien to clear the north of trouble , and for the time ( being they had succeeded . On the whole the news was cheering . The harvest had been good everywhere , so hunger would not drive any more Saxons across before winter closed the seaways . We should have peace for a time ; enough time for Uther to settle any unrest caused by the quarrel with Cornwall and his new marriage , to ratify such alliances as : nbrosius had made , and to strengthen and extend his system of defenses . At length the messenger took his leave . I wrote no letters , cross from the Ely to the mouth of the Uxella in the country of the Dumnonii , and from there I would find my way south-west by the tracks , avoiding the roads where I might fall in with Uther 's troops or Cador 's men . " Do you know the way ? " he asked me . " For the last part , of course , Ralf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . But I can find it . I 've been through that country before , and I have a tongue in my head . " " I can arrange for horses  --  " " Better not , " I said . " We agreed , did we not , that I would be better disguised ? I 'll use a disguise that has served me before . I 'll be a travelling eye doctor , and a humble fellow like that does n't expect to post with fresh horses all the way . Have no fear , I shall be safe , and , when the Queen wants me , I shall be there . " He was satisfied , and stayed for a while longer answering my questions and giving me what news there was . The King 's brief punitive expedition against the coastal raiders had been successful , and the newcomers had been pushed back behind the agreed boundaries of the Federated West Saxons . For the moment things were quiet in the south . From the north had come rumours of tougher fighting where Anglian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alaunus River in the country of the Votadini . This is the country that we of Dyfed call Manau Guotodin , and it is from here that the great King Cunedda came , invited a century ago by the Emperor Maximus , to drive the Irish from Northern Wales and settle there as allies to the Im- perial Eagles . These were , I suppose , the first of the Federates ; they drove the Irish out , and afterwards remained in Northern Wales , which they called Gwynedd . A de- scendant of Cunedda held it still ; Maelgon , a stark king and 5253but sent news of Ralf to his grandmother , and a message of compliance to the Queen , with thanks for the gift of money she had sent me by the messenger 's hand to provide for my journey . Then the young man rode off cheerfully down the valley towards the good company and the better supper that awaited him at the inn . It remained now for me to tell Ralf . This was more difficult even than I had expected . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he looked eagerly about for the man , seeming very disappointed when he found that he had already gone . Messages from his grandmotherhe received almost impatiently , but plied me with questions about the fighting south of Vindocladia , listening with such eagerness to all I could tell him of that and the larger news that it was obvious that his forced inaction in Maridunum fretted him far more than he had shown . When I came to the Queen 's summons he showed more animation than I had seen in him since he had come to me . " How long before we set out ? " " I did not say we ' would set out . I shall go alone . " " Alone ? " You would have thought I had struck him . The blood sprang under the thin skin and he stood staring with his mouth open . Eventually he said , sounding stifled : " You ca n't mean that . You ca n't . " " I 'm not being arbitrary , believe me . I 'd like to take you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why not ? You know everything here will be perfectly safe ; in any case , you 've left it before . And you ca n't travel alone . How would you go on ? " " My dear Ralf . I 've done it before . " " Maybe you have , but you ca n't deny I 've served you well since I 've been here , so why not take me ? You ca n't just go to Tintagel  --  back to where things are happening  --  and leave me here ! I warn you "  --  he took a breath , eyes blazing , allhis careful courtesy collapsing in ruins  --  " I warn you , my lord , if you go without me , I sha n't be here when you come hack ! " I waited till his gaze fell , then said mildly : " Have some sense , boy . Surely you see why I ca n't take you ? The situa- tion has n't changed so much since you had to leave Corn- wall . You know what would happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone knows you round about Tin- tagel . You 'd be seen , and the word would go round . " " I know that . Do you still think I 'm afraid of Cador ? Or of the King ? " " No . But it 's foolish to run into danger when one does n't need to . And the messenger certainly seemed to think there was still danger . " " Then what about you ? Wo n't you be in danger , too ? " " Possibly . I shall have to go disguised , as it is . Why do you think I 've been letting my beard grow all this while ? " " I did n't know . I never thought about it . Do you mean you 've been expecting the Queen to send for you ? " " I did n't expect this summons , I admit , " I said . " But I know that , come Christmas , when the child is born , I must be there . " He stared . " Why ? " I regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth of the cave , against the sunset , just as he had come in from his trip across the hill to the shepherd 's hut . He was still clutching the osier basket which had held the salves . It held a small bundle now , wrapped in a clean linen cloth . The shepherd 's wife , who lived across in the next valley , sent bread up weekly to her man ; some of this Abba regularly sent on to me . I could see the boy 's fists clenched bone-white on the handle of the basket . He was tense , as angry and fretting as a fighting dog held back in the slips . There was54 55something more here , I was sure , than homesickness , or disappointmentat missing an adventure . " Put that basket down , for goodness ' sake , " I said , " and come in . That 's better . Now , sit down . It 's time that you and I talked . When I accepted your service , I did not do so because I wanted someone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife on baking day .

We have fled from danger , both of us , and healed our hurts , and now there is nothing to do but wait . " " For the Queen 's childbed ? Why ? " " Because as soon as he is born , the Queen 's son will be given to me to care for . " He was silent for a full minute before he said , sounding puzzled : " Does my grandmother know this ? " " I think she suspects that the child 's future lies with me . When I last spoke with the King , on that night at Tintagel , he told me he would not acknowledge the child who would be born . I think this is why the Queen has sent for me . " " But . . . not to acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ? Will the Queen agree ? A baby  --  surely they would never send it to you ? How could you keep it ? And how can you even know it will be a boy ? " " Because I had a vision , Ralf , that night in Tintagel . After you had let us in through the postern gate , while the King was with Ygraine , and Ulfin kept guard outside the chamber , you diced with the porter in the lodge by the postern . Do you remember ? " " How could I ever forget ? I thought that night would never end . " I did not tell him that it had not ended yet . I smiled . " I think I felt the same , while I waited alone in the guardroom . It was then that I saw  --  was shown  --  for certain why God had required me to do as I had done , shown for sure that my prophecies had been true . I heard a sound on the stairs , and went out of the guard-room onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down the steps towards me from the Queen 's room , carrying a child . And though it was only March , I felt the chill of midwinter , and then I saw the stairs and the shadows clear through her body , and knew it was a vision . She put the child into my arms and said , Take care of him . ' She was weeping . Then she vanished , and the child too , and the winter 's chill went with her . But this was a true picture , Ralf . At Christmas I shall be there , waiting , and Marcia will hand the Queen 's son into my care . " He was silent for a long time . He seemed awed by the vision . But then he said , practically : " And I ? Where do I come into this ? Is this why my grandmother told me to stay with you and serve you ? " " Yes . She saw no future for you near the King . So she made sure you would be near his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was blank . He sounded horrified , and far from flattered . " You mean that if the King wo n't acknowledge the child , you 'll have to keep it ? I do n't understand . Oh , I can see why my grandmother concerns herself , and even why you do , but not why she dragged me into it ! What sort of future does she think there is in looking after a king 's bastard that wo n't be acknowledged ? " " Not a king 's bastard , " I said . " A king . " There was silence but for the fluttering of the fire . I had not spoken with power , but with the full certainty of knowledge . He stared , open-mouthed , and shaken . " Ralf , " I said , " you came to me in anger , and you stayedIC. 56from duty , and you have served me as well and as faithfully as you knew how . You were no part of my vision , and I do n't know if your coming here , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God 's plan ; I have had no message from my gods since Gorlois died . But I do know now , after these last weeks , that there is no one I would sooner choose to help me . Not with the kind of service you have given till now : when this winter comes it is n't a servant I shall need ; I shall need a fighting man who is loyal , not to me or to the Queen , but to the next High King . " He was pale , and stammering . " I had no idea . I thought ... I thought ... " " That you were suffering a kind of exile ? In a way , we both were . I told you it was a waiting time . " I looked down at my hands . It was dark now outside the cave ; the sun had gone , and dusk drew in . " Nor do I know clearly what lies ahead , except danger and loss and treachery , and in the end some glory . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my thoughts and smiled at him . " So now , perhaps , you will accept that I do n't doubt your courage ? " " Yes . I 'm sorry I spoke as I did . I did n't understand . " He hesitated , chewing his lip , then sat forward , hands on knees . " My lord , you really do n't know why the Queen has sent for you now ? " " No . " " But because you know that your vision of the birth was a true one , you know that you will go safely this time to Cornwall , and return ? " " You could say so . " " Then if your magic is always true , might it not be because I go with you to protect you that you make the journey safely ? " I laughed . " I suppose it 's a good quality in a fighting man , never to admit defeat . But ca n't you see , taking you would only be taking two risks instead of one . Because my bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that you will . " " If you can be disguised , so can I. If you even say that we must go as beggars and sleep in the ditches . . . whatever the danger . . . " He swallowed , sounding all at once very young . " What is it to you if I run a risk ? You are to be safe , you told me so . So taking me ca n't endanger you , and that 's all that matters . Wo n't you let me take my own risks ? Please ? " His voice trailed away . Silence again , and the fire flickering . Time was , I thought , not without bitterness , when I would only have had to watch the flames to find the answer there . ' Would he he safe ? Or would I carry the burden of yet another death ? But all that the firelight showed me was a youth who needed to find manhood . Uther had denied it to him ; I could not let my conscience do the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once that men must stand by their own deeds . I suppose that means I have no right to stop you taking your own risks . Very well , you may come . . . . No , do n't thank me . You 'll dislike me thoroughly enough before we 're done . It will be a damned uncomfortable journey , and before we set out , you 'll have work to do that wo n't suit you . " " I 'm used to that , " he said , and straightened , laughing . He was shining , excited , the gaiety that I remembered back in his face . " But you do n't mean you 're going to teach me magic ? " " I do not . But I shall have to teach you a little medicine , whether you like it or not . I shall be a travelling eye doctor ; rt 's a good passport anywhere , and one can pay one 's way : asily without spending the Queen 's gold abroad where luestions might be asked . So you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means learning to mix the salves properly . " 59 " Well , if I must , but God help the patients ! You know I ca n't tell one herb from the other . " " Never fear , I would n't let you touch them . You can leave me to select the plants . You 'll just prepare them . " " And if any of Cador 's men show signs of recognizing us , just try some of my salves on them , " he said buoyantly . " Talk about magic , it 'll be easy . The eye doctor 's skilled assistant will simply strike them blind . " 6oWe came to the inn at Camelford two days before the middle of September . The Camel valley is winding , with steep sides clothed with trees . For the last part of the way we followed the track along the waterside . The trees were closely crowded , and the path where we rode was so thickly padded with moss and small , dark-green ferns that our horses ' hoofs made no sound . Beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that glittered in the sun . Around and above us the dense hangers of oak and beech were turning yellow , and acorns crunched among the dead leaves where the horses trod . Nuts ripened in the thickets ; the willows trailed amber leaves in the tugging shallows ; and wherever the bright sun splashed through the boughs it shimmered on the spiders ' webs of autumn furred and glittering , sagging deep with dew . Our journey had been uneventful . Once south of the Severn and beyond hourly danger of recognition , we had ridden at ease , and in pleasant stages . The weather , as so often in September , was warm and bright , but with a crisp feel to the air that made riding a pleasure . Ralf had been in high spirits all the way , in spite of poor clothes , an undis- tinguished horse ( bought with some of the Queen 's gold ) and the work he had had to do for me making the washes and ointments with which I largely paid our way . We were only questioned once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on us just short of Hercules Point . Uther kept the old Roman camp there garrisoned as a strongpoint , and by the purest6imischance we fell foul of a scouting party which was makingits way home by the moorland track we followed . We were taken to the camp and questioned , though it seemed this was merely a matter of form as , after a cursory look at our baggage , my story was accepted . We were sent on our way with our flasks refilled with the ration wine , the richer for a copper coin given me by a man off duty who followed us out of camp and begged a pot of salve from me . I found the men 's vigilance interesting , and would have liked to know more of the state of affairs in the north , but that would have to wait . To have asked questions here would have attracted attention I did not want . No doubt I would find out what I wished to know from the Queen herself . " Did you see anyone you knew ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brisk canter away from the gate of the camp . " None . Did you ? " " I 'd met the officer before , a few years ago . His name is Priscus . But he gave no sign of recognizing me . " " I would n't have known you myself , " said Ralf . " And it is n't just the beard . It 's the way you walk , your voice , everything . It 's like that night at Tintagel , when you were disguisedas the Duke 's captain . I 'd known him all my life , and I 'd have sworn you were he . It 's no wonder folks are talking about magic . I thought it was magic myself . " " This is easier , " I said . " If you carry a trade or a skill with you men think about that , instead of looking at you too closely . " Indeed , I had troubled very little with disguise . I had bought a new riding cloak , brown , with a hood which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the accent of Brittany . This is a tongue close to the Cornish one , and would be understood where we were going . This , with the beard , and my humble tradesman 's bearing , should keep any6zbut my intimates from knowing me . Nothing would part me from the brooch my father had given me , with its royal cipher of the Red Dragon on gold , but I wore it clipped inside the breast of my tunic , and had threatened Ralf with every fate in the Nine Books of Magic if he called me " my lord " even in private . We reached Camelford towards evening . The inn was a small squat building of daubed stone built where the coast road ran down into the ford . It was at the top of the bank , just clear of flood level . Ralf and I , approaching by the country track along the river , came on it from the rear . It seemed a pleasant place , and clean . Someone had given the stones a wash of red ochre , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked about among the ricks at the edge of a swept yard . A chained dog dozed in the shade of a mulberry tree heavy with fruit . There was a tidy stack of firewood against the byre , and the midden was fully twenty feet from the back door . As luck would have it , the innkeeper 's wife was out at the back with a maidservant , taking in bedding which had been spread over the bushes in the sun . As we approached the dog flew out , barking , at the length of his chain . The woman straightened , shading her eyes against the light , and staring . She was a young woman , broadly built and lively looking , with a fresh , high colour and prominent light-blue eyes . Her bad teeth and plump figure gave away a rash passion for sweetmeats , and the lively blue eyes spoke even more clearly of other pleasures . They ran now over Ralf , who rode ahead of me , appraised him as likely , but young for it ; then , more hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely , and probably too poor to pay my shot anyway . Then , as her gaze returned to Ralf , I saw her recognize him . She stiffened , looking quickly back at me . Her mouth fell open , and I63thought for an anxious moment that she was going to curtsy , but then she had command of herself . A word sent the maid packing indoors with an armful of bedding , a shrill bidding to the dog drove him back , ears down and growling , into the mulberry shade , then she was greeting us , smiling widely , eyes curious and excited . " You 'll be the eye doctor , likely ? " We drew our horses to a halt in the dust of the yard . " Indeed , mistress . My name is Emrys , and this is my servant Ban . " " We 've been expecting you . Your beds is bespoke . " Then under her breath as she came close to my horse 's shoulder : " You be very welcome , my lord , and Ralf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than when I seen him last . Will you be pleased to come in ? " I dismounted and handed the reins to Ralf . " Thank you . It 's good to be here ; we 're both weary . Ralf will look after the horses himself . Now before we go in , Maeve , give me the news from Tintagel . Is all well with the Queen ? " " Yes , indeed , sir , praise be to all the saints and fairies . You need have no worries there , surely . " " And the King ? He 's still at Tintagel ? " " Aye , my lord , but the word goes that he 'll ride out any day now . You 'll not have long to bide . You 're as safe here as anywhere in Cornwall . We 'll have good enough warning of troops moving , and you can hear them on this road a mile off . And never worry about Caw  --  that 's my husband ; he 's a Duke 's man , sure enough , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides , he always does as I tell him . Leastways , not always . There 's some things he do n't do near often enough for my liking . " This with a burst of cheery laughter . I saw Ralf grinning as he led the horses away , then Maeve , talking loudly about beds and supper-time , and the sore eyes of her64youngest which could do with looking at , led me through the back door of the inn . When I saw her husband later that evening I knew that I need have no fears for his discretion . He was a dry stick of a man , and silent as an oyster . He came in as we were sitting down to supper , stared at Ralf , nodded at me , then went about his business of serving wine without a word spoken . His wife treated him  --  and all comers  --  with the same rough , frank kindliness , and saw to it without fuss that we were well served and comfortably housed . It was as good a house of its kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was excellent . Understandably , the inn was always busy , but there was little danger of our being recognized . My character as a travelling healer was not only my pass to people 's incurious acceptance ; it gave Ralf and me the excuse to be abroad in the countryside . Each day early we would take food and wine with us , and make our way up by one of the deep , densely wooded glens that fed the Camel valley , to the windy upland that lay between Camelford and the sea . Ralf knew all the ways . We would separate , more often than not , and each choose some hidden point of vantage from which he could watch the two roads which Uther and his men might take out of Tintagel . He might turn north-east along the coast for Dimilioc and the camp near Hercules Point , or  --  if he was making straight for Winchester or the trouble centersalong the Saxon Shore  --  he would follow the valley tracks through Camelford and from there climb south-east to the military road which ran along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest thins , and there are great tracts of broken moorland treacherous with bog and watched over by strange stony hills . The old Roman road , crumbling fast in that wild country , but still serviceable , runs straight through Isca , into the kinder lands be-65hind Ambrosius ' Wall . It was my guess that this latter was the way that Uther would take , and I wanted to see who rode with him . Ralf and I gave it out that I was searching for plants for my medicines , and indeed I came back each evening to my meeting-place with him with a pouch full of roots and berries which did not grow at home , and which I was glad to have . Luckily the weather continued fine , and no one wondered to see us ride abroad . They were too glad to have a doctor staying there who , each evening , would treat any who came to him , and ask no more than they could afford to pay . So the days went by , serene and still , while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send word . It was a week before he rode out . He went the way I had expected , and I was there watching . There is a place where the track from Tintagel to Camelfordruns straight for some quarter of a mile along the foot of a steeply wooded bank . For the most part the wood is too steep and thickly grown to penetrate , but there were places at the wood 's edge open to the sun , stony banks deep in ferns and drifting thistledown , where brambles and bracken grew in thickets over the rocks . The blackthorn bushes were high , and glinting with fruit . Some of the little sloe-plums were still greenish , but most were ready ; black bloomed over pale blue with ripeness . There is an extract one can make of the fruit which is sovereign for a flux of the bowels : one of Maeve 's children had been suffering in this way , and I had promised a draught that night . It would need no more than a handful , but the fruit was ripe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering . If the berries are crushed and added in a certain way to juniper-wine they make a good drink , rich , astringent and powerful . I had told Maeve of it , and she wanted to try it . My bag was almost full when I heard , like a soft thunder66in the distance , horses coming steadily along the track below me . I withdrew quickly into the edge of the wood , and watched from hiding . Soon the head of the column came in sight ; then the long train of dust , filled with the beat of trotting hoofs , the clash of mail , the coloured glint of pennants , rolled past along the foot of the slope . A thousand , perhaps more . I stood stone-still in the shadow of the trees , and watched them go by . A horse 's length to the front the King rode , and behind him , on his left hand , his standard-bearer carried the Red Dragon . Other colours showed through the dust , but there was no wind to move the banners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the column , I could not swear to most that I saw . Nor did I glimpse the one I was watching for , though it might well have been there . I waited till the last horseman disappeared at a smart trot round a bend in the road , then I made my way to the place where I had arranged to meet Ralf . He met me halfway , panting . " Did you see them ? " " Yes . Where were you ? I sent you to watch the other road . " " I was watching . There was nothing stirring there , nothing at all . I was on my way back here when I heard them , so I ran . I almost missed them  --  only saw the tail end . It was the King , was n't it ? " " It was . Ralf , could you pick out the devices ? Did you see any that you knew ? " " I saw Brychan , and Cynfelin , but no others from Dyfnaintthat I recognized . The men from Garlot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others I thought I knew , but there was too much dust to make sure . They were round that bend before I could get a good sight of them . " " Was Cador there ? " " My lord , I 'm sorry , I did n't see . " 67 " No matter . If the others were there from Cornwall , you may be sure he would be . No doubt they 'll know at the inn . And had you forgotten that you were not to call me my lord , ' even when we were alone ? " " I 'm sorry . . . Emrys . " It was a measure of our new , easier relationship that he should add , with a suspicious meekness : " And had you forgotten that my name is Ban ? " Then , laughing as he dodged my cuff at his head : " Do you have to call me after the half-wit ? " " It 's the first name that came into my head . It 's a king 's name too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your choice which was your sponsor . " " Benoic ? Where 's that ? " " In the north . Come now , we 'll get back to the inn . I doubt if the Queen will send before tomorrow , but I 've a draught to make tonight , and it 's a decoction that takes time . Here , carry these . " I was right ; the messenger came next morning . Ralf had gone out down the road to watch for him , and the two of them came back together , with the news that I was to ride to Tintagel immediately for my audience with the Queen . I had not confessed it to Ralf , nor even hardly admitted it to myself , but I was apprehensive about the coming interview with Ygraine . On that night at Tintagel when the child was conceived I had been certain , in every way a seer can be certain , that the boy who was to be born would be given to me to foster , and that I should be the guardian of a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Gorlois ' death , had sworn to reject the " bastard " he had begotten , and from Marcia 's letter I knew he was still of the same mind . But in the six long months since that March night I had had no direct message from Ygraine , and no means of knowing whether she would obey her husband , or whether as the time drew near she would find it impossible to face separa-68tion from her child . 1 had gone over in my mind a hundred times all the arguments I might bring to bear , remembering half incredulously the sureness with which I had spoken to her before , and to the King . Indeed my god had been with me then . And in truth , and how bitterly , was he gone from me now . There were even times when , lying wakeful in the night , I saw my sure visions in the past as chances , illusions , dreams fed by desire . I remembered the King 's bitter words to me. " 1 see now what your magic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but human trickery , an attempt at statecraft which my brother taught you to like and to play for , and to believe was your mystery . You use even God to gain your ends . It is God who tells me to do these things , it is God who exacts the price , it is God who sees that others should pay . . . ' For what , Merlin ? For your ambition ? And who is it pays this debt to God for carrying out your plans ? Not you . The men who play your game for you , and pay the price . But you pay nothing . " When I listened to such words as these , heard clearly in the nights when nothing else spoke to me , I wondered if I had read my vision of the future aright , or if everything I had done and dreamed of had been a mockery . Then , thinking of those who had paid with death for my dream , I would wonder if that death had not been kinder than this desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for even the smallest of my gods to speak to me . Oh , yes , I paid . Every night of those nine long months I paid . But now it was day , and I would soon find out what the Queen wanted with me . I remember how restlessly I fidgeted around while Ralf saddled my horse and made ready . Maeve was with the maids in the kitchen , washing the sloes for the wine-making . A pan of them was on the stove , coming to the simmer . It seemed a strange memory to take with me on my visit to the Queen , the smell of sloe wine . Suddenly I found69the pungent sweetness intolerable , and made , choking , for the air outside . But then one of the girls came running to ask something about the mixing , and in answering her I forgot my sickness , and then all at once Ralf was at my elbow to summon me , and the three of us  --  Ralf , the messenger and I  --  were heading for Tintagel at a hand-gallop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months since I had last seen Ygraine , but she seemed very much changed . At first I thought this was only the pregnancy ; her once-slim body was greatly swollen and , though her face was full of the bloom of health , she had that pinched and shadowy look that women get around the eyes and mouth . But the change was deeper than this ; it was in the expression of her eyes , in her gestures , the way she sat . Where before she had seemed young and burning , a wild bird beating her wings against the wires of the cage , now she seemed to brood , wings clipped , gravid , a creature of the ground . She received me in her own chamber , a long room above the curtain wall , with a deep circular recess where the turret stood at the north-west corner . There were windows in the long wall facing south-west , and through these the sunlight fell freely , but the Queen was sitting by one of the narrow turret windows , through which came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal noise of the sea on the rocks below . So much was still here , then , of the Ygraine I remembered . It was like her , I thought , to choose the wind and the sea sounds , rather than the sunlight . But even here , in spite of the light and air , one got the feeling of a cage : this was the room in which the young wife of Gorlois the old Duke had passed those pent years before the fateful trip to London where she had met the King . Now , after that brief flight , she was penned again , by her love for the King , and by the weight of his child . I never loved a woman , 71except one , but I have pitied them . Now , looking at the Queen , young , beautiful , and with her heart 's desire , I pitied her even as I feared her for what she might say to me . She was alone . I had been led by a chamberlain through the outer room where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me in momentary curiosity , and the chattering was stilled , only to begin again as soon as I had passed . There was no recognition in their faces , only perhaps here and there some disappointment at the sight of so ordinary and humble a fellow . No diversion here . To them I was a messenger , to be received by the Queen in the King 's absence ; that was all . The chamberlain rapped on the door of the inner chamber and then withdrew . Marcia , Ralf 's grandmother , opened the door . She was a grey-haired woman with Ralf 's eyes in a lined and anxious face , but in spite of her age she bore herself as straight as a girl . Though she was expecting me , I saw her eyes rest on me for a moment without recognition , then with a flicker of surprise . Even Ygraine looked startled for a moment , then she smiled and held out her hand . " Prince Merlin . Welcome . " Marcia curtsied to the air somewhere between me and the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss the Queen 's hand . " Madam . " She raised me kindly . " It was good of you to come so quickly for such a strange summons . I hope the journey was easy ? " " Very easy . We are well lodged with Maeve and Caw , and so far no one has recognized me , or even Ralf . Your secret is safe . " " I must thank you for taking so much care of it . I promise you I 'd not have known you until you spoke . " I fingered my chin , smiling . " As you see , I 've been preparing for some time . " 72 " No magic this time ? " " As much as there was before , " I said . She looked at inc straightly then , the beautiful dark-blue eyes meeting mine in the way I remembered , and I saw that this was still the old Ygraine , direct as a man , and with the same high pride . The heavy stillness was just an overlay , the milky calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stillness , the placidity , was the old fire . She spread her hands out . " Looking at me now , do you still tell me that when you spoke to me that night in London , and promised me the King 's love , there was no magic there ? " " Not in the ruse that brought the King to you , madam . In what happened after , perhaps . " " Perhaps ' ? " There was a quick lift to her voice that warned me . Ygraine might be a Queen , with mettle as high as a man 's , but she was a woman nearing her seventh month . My fears were my own , and must stay my own . I hesitated , searching for words , but she went on quickly , burningly , as if to convince herself across my silence : " When you first spoke with me and told me you could bring the King to me , there was magic there , I know there was . I felt it , and I saw it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from God , and that in obeying you I was God 's creature , even as you were . You said that because of the magic that would bring Uther to me , the kingdom should have peace . You spoke of crowns and altars . . . . And now , see , I am Queen , with God 's blessing , and I am heavy with the King 's child . Dare you tell me now that you deceived me ? " " I did not deceive you , madam . That was a time full of visions , and a passion of dreams and desires . We are quit of those now , and we are sober , and it is daylight . But magic is here , growing in you , and this time it is fact , not vision . I lc will be born at Christmas , they tell me . " " He ' ? You sound very sure . " 73 " I am sure . " I saw her press her lips together as if at a sudden spasm of pain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands which lay folded across her belly . When she spoke , she spoke calmly , straight to her hands , or to what they covered . " Marcia told me of the messages she sent to you in the summer . But you must have known , without her telling you , the way my lord the King thinks of this matter . " I waited , but she seemed to expect an answer . " He told me himself , " I said . " If he 's still of the same mind now as he was then , he wo n't acknowledge the child as his heir . " " He is still of the same mind . " Her eyes came swiftly up to mine again . " Do n't misunderstand me , he has not the faintestdoubt of me , nor ever had . He knows that I was his from the first moment I saw him , and that from that moment , on one excuse or another , I never lay with the Duke . No , he does not doubt me ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high speech "  --  there was the glimmer of a smile , and suddenlyher voice was indulgent , the voice of a woman speaking of her child or of a loved husband  --  " and for all his rough denials , he knows your power and fears it . You told him a child would come out of that night , and he would trust your word , even if he could not trust mine . But none of this alters the way he feels about it . He blames himself  --  and you , and even the child  --  for the Duke 's death . " " I know . " " If he had waited , he says , Gorlois would still have died that night , and I would have been Queen , and the child conceived in wedlock , so that no one could question his parentageor call him bastard . " " And you , Ygraine ? " She was silent for a long time . She turned that lovely head of hers and gazed out of the window , where the sea birds swung and tilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not surehow , that her calm was that of a soldier who has won one battle , and rests before the next . I felt my nerves tighten . I did not hold Ygraine lightly , should the battle be with me . She said , very quietly : " What the King says may well be true . I do n't know . But what 's done is done , and it is the child who must concern me now . This is why I sent for you . " A pause . I waited . She faced me again . " Prince Merlin , I fear for the child . " " At the King 's hands ? " I asked . This was too straight , even for Ygraine . Her eyes were cold , and her voice . " This is insolence , and folly , too . You forget yourself , my lord . " " I ? " I spoke as coldly . " It is you who forget , madam . If my mother had been wed to Ambrosius when he begot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would I have helped him to your bed to beget the child you carry . There should be no talk of insolence or folly from you to me . I know , who better , what chance there is in Britain for a prince conceived out of wedlock and unacknowledged by his sire . " She had flushed as red as she was pale before . Her eyes dropped from mine , their anger dying . She spoke simply , like a girl . " You are right , I had forgotten . I ask your pardon . I 'd forgotten , too , what it was like to talk freely . There is no one here besides Marcia and my lord , and I can not talk to Uther about the child . " I had been standing all this while ; now I turned aside to bring up a chair and set it near her in the turret embrasure . I sat down . Things had changed between us , suddenly , as when a wind changes . I knew then that the battle was not with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was watching me now as a woman in pain watches her doctor . I said gently : " Well , I am here . And I am listening . What did you send for me to tell me ? " She drew in her breath . When she spoke her voice was74 75calm , but no more than a whisper . " That if this child is a boy , the King will not allow me to rear him . If it 's a girl I may keep her , but a boy so begotten can not be acknowledged as a prince and legitimate heir , so he must not remain here , even as a bastard . " Visibly , she steadied herself . " I told you , Uther does not doubt me . But because of what happened that night , my husband 's death , and all the talk of magic , he swears that men may still believe that the Duke and not himself begot this child . There will be other sons , he says , whose begetting no man will question , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingdom . " " Ygraine , " I said , " I know what a heavy thing it is  --  howeverit happens  --  for a woman to lose her child . Perhaps there is no heavier grief . But I think the King is right . The boy should not remain here to be reared as a bastard in times so wild and uncertain . If there should be other heirs , declared and acknowledged by the King , they might count him a danger to themselves , and certainly they would be a danger for him . I know what I 'm talking about ; this is what happened in my own childhood . And I , as a royal bastard , found fortune as this prince may never find it ; I had my father 's protection . " A pause . She nodded without speaking , her eyes once again on the hands that lay in her lap . " And if the child is to be sent away , " I said , " it 's better that he should be taken straight from the birth chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Believe nee "  --  I spoke quickly , though she had not moved  --  " this is true . I 'm speaking now as a doctor . " She moistened her lips . " Marcia says the same . " I waited a moment , but she said no more . I started to speak , found my voice come hoarsely , and cleared my throat . In spite of myself , my hands tightened on the arms of my chair . But my voice was calm and steady as I came to thecore of the interview . " Has the King told you where the child is to be fostered ? " " No . I told you it was n't easy to talk to him about it . But when he last spoke of it he said he would take counsel ; and he spoke of Brittany . " " Brittany ? " For all my care , the word came out with a cutting edge . I fought to recover my calm . My hands had clenched on the chair , and I relaxed them and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oddly enough , the knowledge hardened me . If I must fight the King as well as Ygraineyes , and my Delphic gods as well  --  then I would do so . As long as I could see the ground to fight from . . . " So Uther will send him to King Budec ? " " It seems so . " She seemed to have noticed nothing strange in my manner . " He sent a messenger a month ago . That was just before I sent to ask you to come . Budec is the obvious choice , after all . " This was true . King Budec of Less Britain was a cousin of the King 's . It was he who , some thirty years ago , had taken my father and the young Uther under his protection when the usurper Vortigern murdered their elder brother King Constans , and in his capital of Kerrec they had assembled and trained the army which had won the High Kingdom back from Vortigern . But I shook my head . " Too obvious . If anyone should look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where to go . Budec ca n't protect him all the time . Besides- " " Budec can not care for my child as he should be cared for ! " The words came forcibly , stopping me short , but the interruption was not uncivil . It came almost like a cry . It was plain that she had not heard a word I had said . She was fighting herself , choosing words . " He is old , and besides , Brittany is a long way off , and less secure even than this Saxon-ridden land . Prince Merlin , I  --  Marcia and I  --  we think that you  --  " The hands suddenly twisted together in herlap . Her voice changed . " There is no one else we can trust . And Uther  --  whatever Uther says , he knows that his kingdom , or any part of it , would be safe in your hands . You are Ambrosius ' son , and the child 's closest kinsman . Everyone knows your power , and fears it  --  the child would be safe with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take him , Merlin ! " She was begging me now . " Take him safe , somewhere away from this cruel coast , and rear him for me . Teach him as you were taught , and rear him as a King 's son should be reared , and then when he is grown , bring him back and let him take his place as you did , at the next King 's side . " She faltered . I must have been staring at her like a fool . She fell quiet , twisting her hands . There was a long silence , filled with the scent of the salt wind and the crying of the gulls . I had not been aware of rising , but I found myself standing at the window with my back to the Queen , staring out at the sky . Below the turret wall the gulls wheeled and mewed in the wind , and far below , at the foot of the black cliff , the sea dashed and whitened . But I saw and heard nothing . My hands were pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when at length I lifted them and straightened they showed a mottled bar of bloodless flesh where the stone had bitten in . I began to chafe them , only now feeling the small hurt as I turned back to meet the Queen 's eyes . She too had hold of herself again , but I saw strain in her face , and a hand plucked at her gown . I said flatly : " Do you think you can persuade the King to give him to me ? " " No . I do n't think so . I do n't know . " She swallowed . " Of course I can talk to him , but  --  " " Then why send for me to ask me this , if you have no power to sway the King ? " She was white , and her lips worked together , but she kept78her head up and faced me . " I thought that if you agreed , my lord , you could  --  you would  --  " " I can do nothing with Uther now . You should know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Or did you send for me as you did last time , hoping for magic to order , as if I were an old spell-wife , or a country druid ? I would have thought , madam  --  " I stopped . I had seen the flinching in her eyes , and the drawn pallor round her mouth , and I remembered what she carried in her . My anger died . I turned up a hand , speaking gently : " Very well . If it can be done , Ygraine , I will do it , even if I have to talk to Uther myself to remind him of his promise . " " His promise ? What did he promise you , and when ? " " When he first sent for me , and told me of his love for you , he swore to obey me in anything , if only he could have his way . " I smiled at her . " It was meant as a bribe rather than a promise , but no matter , we 'll hold it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank me , but I stopped her . " No , no , keep your thanks . I may not succeed with the King ; you know how little he loves me . You were wise to send secretly , and you 'll be wiser not to let him know we talked of this together . " " He sha n't know from me . " I nodded . " Now , for the child 's sake and your own , you must put your fears aside . Leave this to me . Even if we ca n't move the King , I promise you that wherever the child is fostered , I shall make it my business to watch over him . He will be kept safely , and reared as a King 's son should be reared . Will that content you ? " " If it has to , yes . " She drew a long breath then and moved at last , rising from her chair and , still gracefully in spite of her bulk , pacing down the long room to one of the far windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for a while with her back to me , in silence . When at length she turned , she was smiling . She lifted a hand to beckon me and I went to her . " Will you tell me one thing , Merlin ? " " If I can . " " That night when we spoke in London , before you brought the King to me here . You talked of a crown , and a sword standing in an altar like a cross . I have wondered so much about it , thinking . . . Tell me now , truly . Was it my crown you saw ? Or did you mean that this child  --  this boy who has cost so much  --  that he will be King ? " I should have said to her : " Ygraine , I do not know . If my vision was true , if I was a true prophet , then he will be King . But the Sight has left me , and nothing speaks to me in the night or in the fire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , and take the time on trust . But there is no going back . God will not waste all the deaths . " But she was watching me with the eyes of a woman in pain , so I said to her : " He will be King . " She bent her head and stood silent for a few moments , watching the sunlight on the floor , not as if thinking , but as if listening to what stirred within her . Then she looked up at me again . " And the sword in the altar ? " I shook my head . " Madam , I do n't know . It has not come yet . If I am to know , I will be shown . " She put out a hand . " One more thing . . . " From something in her voice , I knew that this mattered most to her . Not knowing what was coming , I braced myself to lie . She said : " If I must lose this child . . . Shall I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have asked me , Ygraine . " " You wo n't answer ? " 8oI had spoken only to gain time , but at the flash of fear and doubt in her eyes I was glad to tell her the truth . " I would answer you , madam , but I do not know . " " How is that ? " she asked sharply . I lifted my shoulders . " That again I can not answer . Furtherthan this boy you carry , I have not seen . But it seems probable , since he is to be King , that you will have no other sons . Girls , maybe , to bring you comfort . " " I shall pray for it , " she said simply , and led the way back to the embrasure . She gestured me to sit . " Will you not take a cup of wine with me now , before you leave ? I 've received you poorly , I 'm afraid , after asking such a journey of you , but I was in torment until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me now for a little while , and tell me what the news is with you ? " So I stayed a short while longer and , after I had given her my meager news , I asked where Uther was bound with his troops . She told me that he was heading , not for his capital at Winchester as I had supposed , but northwards to Viroconium , where he had called a council of leaders and petty kings from the north and north-east . Viroconium is the old Roman town which lies on the border of Wales , with the mountains of Gwynedd between it and the threat of the Irish Shore . It was still at this time a market center , and the roads were well maintained . Once out of the Dumnonian Peninsula , Uther could make good speed north by the Glevum Bridge . He might even , if the weather stayed fair and the country quiet , be back for the Queen 's lying-in . For the moment , Ygraine told me , the Saxon Shore was quiet ; after Uther 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the federated tribes . There was no clear news from the north , but the King ( she told me ) feared some kind of concerted action there in the spring between81the Picts of Strathclyde and the invading Angles : the meet- ing of the Kings at Viroconium had been called in an attempt to thrash out some kind of united plan of defense . " And Duke Cador ? " I asked her . " Does he stay here in Cornwall , or go on to Vindocladia to watch the Saxon Shore ? " Her answer surprised me . " He is going north with the King , to the council . " " Is he indeed ? Then I 'd better guard myself . " At her quick look I nodded . " Yes , I shall go straight to the King . Time grows short , and it 's luck for me that he 's travelling north . He 's bound to take his troops by the Glevum Bridge , so Ralf and I can cross by the ferry and get there before him . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show him that I ever left Wales . " Soon after that I took my leave . When I left her she was standing by the window again . Her head was held high , and the breeze was ruffling her dark hair . I knew then that when the time came the child would not be taken from a weeping and regretful woman , but from a Queen , who was content to let him go to his destiny . Not so with Marcia . She was waiting for me in the ante- room , bursting with questions , regrets , and anger against the King which she barely smothered into discretion . I reas- sured her as best I could , swore several times on every god in every shrine and hollow hill in Britain that I would do my utmost to get possession of the child and keep him safe , but when she started to ask me for spells for protection in child- bed , and to talk of wet-nurses , I left her talking , and made for the door . Forgetting herself in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And did I tell you ? The King says she must have his own physician , a man he can trust to put the right stories about afterwards , and say nothing about where the poor mite goes for fostering . As if it was n't more importantthat my lady should be properly looked after ! Give any doctor enough gold , and he 'd swear his own mother 's life away , everybody knows that . " " Certainly , " I said gravely . " But I know Gandar well , and there 's no one better . The Queen will be in good hands . " " But an army doctor ! What can he know about child-birth ? " I laughed . " He served with my father 's army in Brittany for a long time . Where there are fighting men , there are also their women . My father had a standing army in Brittany of fifteen thousand men , encamped . Believe me , Gandar has had plenty of experience . " With that she had to be content . She was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the inn that night , cloaked and hooded , and riding straight as a man . Maeve led her to the room her family shared , drove out everyone  --  including Caw  --  who was still awake , then took Ralf in to talk to his grandmother . I was in bed before she left . Next morning Ralf and I set out for Bryn Myrddin , with a flask or two of sloe wine to cheer us on our way . To my surprise , Ralf seemed every bit as cheerful as he had been on the way south . I wondered if , after the brief spell back in the scene of his childhood , service with me had begun to look like freedom . He had heard all the news from his grandmother ; he told it me as we rode ; most of it was what I had learned already from the Queen , with some court gossip added which was entertaining but hardly informative , except for the talk which was inevitably going round about Uther 's rejection of the child . Ralf , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to get custody of the baby. 83 " If the King refuses , what will you do ? " " Go to Brittany to talk to King Budec . " " Do you think he 'll let you stay with the prince ? " " Budec is my kinsman too , remember . " " Well , but would he risk offending King Uther ? Would he keep it secret from him ? " " That I ca n't tell you , " I said . " If it had been Hoel , now  --  Budec 's son  --  that would be different . He and Uther alwaysfought like dogs after the same bitch . " I did not add that the description was in fact more accurate than was decent . Ralf merely nodded , chewing ( we had stopped on a sunny hillside to eat ) , and reached for a flask . " Have some of this ? " He was offering me the sloe wine . " God of green grapes , boy , no ! It wo n't be ready to drink for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open it then . " But he insisted , and unstoppered the flask . It certainly smelled odd and , he admitted , tasted worse . When I suggested , not unkindly , that Maeve had probably made a mistake and given him the medicine for the flux , he spat the mouthful out on the grass , then asked me a little stiffly what I was laughing at . " Not at you . Here , let me taste the stuff . . . . Well , there 's nothing in it that there should n't be ; but I must have been thinking of something else when they asked me about the mixing . No , I was laughing at myself . All these months  --  these years , even  --  hammering at heaven 's doors to get what ? A baby and a wet-nurse . If you insist on staying with me , Ralf , the next few years will certainly bring new experiences for both of us . " He merely nodded ; he was busy pursuing present anxieties . " If we have to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this ? For years ? " He flicked with a contemptuous finger at the coarse stuff of his cloak . " That will depend . Not quite like this , I hope . Hold step till you reach your bridges , Ralf . " His face showed me that this was not how enchanters were expected to talk . They built their own bridges , or flew across without them . " Depend on the King , you mean ? Must you seek him out ? My grandmother says , if it 's put about that the baby 's stillborn , it could be handed to you secretly , and the King never know . " " You forget . Men must know if a prince is born . How else , when Uther dies , can they be brought to accept him ? " " Then what are you going to do , my lord ? " I shook my head , not answering . He took my silence for refusal to tell him , and accepted it with no more questions . For my part , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was waiting to see a way over . With the Queen won , the harder half of the game was played ; now I must plan how best to deal with the King  --  whether to seek his consent openly , or go first to Budec . But as we sat finishing our meal I was not thinking overmuch about Brittany , or the King , or even the child ; I was content to rest in the sun and let the time go over . What had just happened at Tintagel had happened without my contriving . Something was moving ; there was a kind of breathing brightnessin the air , the wind of God brushing by , invisible in sunlight . Even for men who can not see or hear them , the gods are still there , and I was not less than a man . I had not the arrogance  --  or the hardihood  --  to test my power again , but I put on hope , as a naked man welcomes rags in a winter storm. 84 85The weather held , so we went easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels of Uther 's force ; if we were caught west of the Uxella marshes  --  or indeed south of the Severn at all  --  it would be only too obvious where we had been . Uther usually moved fast , and there was nothing to delay him here in settled country , so we followed cautiously , wait- ing until his army should be clear of the southern end of the Severn ferry . If we were lucky with the ferry and , once we were across the Severn , made good speed northwards , we should be able ( having apparently just come innocently for the purpose from Maridunum ) to fall in with the troops on their way up the Welsh border , and try to have speech with the King . On the way south we had avoided the main road , but had used the pack tracks which run near the coast , winding in and out of the valleys . Now , since we dared not fall too far behind Uther , we kept as closely as we dared to the straight route along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations might be left guarded in the army 's wake . We were even more careful than we had been formerly . After we had left the shelter of Maeve 's roof we sought out no more inns . Indeed , the ways we went boasted of no inns even had we looked for them ; we lodged where we could  --  in wood-cutters ' cabins , sheep shelters , even once or twice in the lee of a stack of bracken cut for bedding  --  and blessed the mild weather . It was wild country through which we went . There are high ridged stretches of moorland , where heather grows among the granite tors , and the land is good to feed nothing except the sheep and the wild deer ; but just below the rocky spine of the land the forest begins . On the uplands the trees grow sparsely , raked by the wind , already in early autumn half scoured of leaves . But lower , in every dip and valley , the forest is dense , of trees crowded and hugely grown , impassable with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here and there , unnoticed until you stumble across them , are crags and bouldered screes of rock thickly clothed with thorn and creeper , invisible and deadly as a wolf trap . Even more dangerous are the stretches of bog , some black and slimy , some innocent and green as a meadow , where a man on horseback can sink from sight as easily and almost as quickly as a spoon sinking into a bowl of gruel . There are secret ways through these places , known to the beasts and the forest dwellers , but mostly men shun them . At night the soft ground flickers with marshlights and strange dancing flames which , men say , are the souls of the wandering dead . Ralf had known the ways in his own country , but once we struck the low-lying marshy forests through which the Uxella and its tributaries flow towards the Severn we had to go more cautiously , relying on information from the people of the forest , charcoal-burners and woodmen , and once or twice a solitary hermit or holy man who offered us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ralf seemed to enjoy the rough travel and rougher lodging , and even the danger that seemed to lie . about us in forest and track , and the threat of the army so few miles ahead . Both of us grew daily more unkempt and more like the roles we had assumed . It might be said that our disguise was more necessary here even than in Tintagel ; woe betide the King 's messenger or merchant who rides off the guarded road in these parts , but the poor are received kindly , vagrants or holy men with87nothing to steal , and Ralf and I , as poor travelling healers , met welcome everywhere . There was nowhere we could not buy food and shelter with a copper penny and a pot of medicine . The marsh folk always need medicine , living as they do at the edge of the fetid bogland , with agues and swollen joints and the fear of fever . They build their huts right at the borders of the scummed pools , just clear of the deep black mud at the edge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . The huts crack and rot and fall to pieces every year , and have to be patched each spring , but in spring and autumn the flocks of travelling birds fly down to drink , in summer the waters are full of fish and the forest of game , and in winter the folk break the ice and lie in wait for the deer to come and drink . And always the place is loud with frogs ; I have eaten these many times in Brittany , and it is true that they make a good meal . So the folk of the marshes cling to their stinking cabins , and eat well and drink the standing water , and die of the fever and the flux ; nor do they fear the walking fires which haunt the marsh at night , for these are the souls of men they knew . We were still twelve miles short of the ferry , and it was growing dusk , when the first hint of trouble came . The oak forests had given way to a lighter woodland of birch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the track that we had to lie low on the horses ' necks to avoid the whipping branches . Though there had been no rain the ground was very soft , and now and again our horses ' hoofs splashed deep in the black mire . Soon , somewhere near us , I smelled the marsh , and before long through the thinning trees we could see the dull glimmer of the bog pools reflectingthe last light from the sky . My horse stumbled , floundering , and Ralf , who was riding ahead of me , checked and put a quick hand to my rein . Then he pointed ahead . Ahead of us , a different light pricked the dusk : the steady , 88dull yellow of candle or rushlight . The hut of a marsh dweller . We rode towards it . The dwelling was not set over the water , but the ground was very wet , and was no doubt flooded in bad weather , for the hut was raised on piles , and approached by a narrow causeway of logs sawn short and jammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barked . I could see a man , a shadow against the dully lit interior of the hut , peering out at us . I hailed him . The marsh dwellers speak a tongue of their own , but they understand the Celtic of the Dumnonii . " My name is Emrys . I 'm a travelling doctor , and this is my servant . We 're making for the ferry at Uxella . We came by the forest because the King 's army is on the road . We 're looking for shelter , and can pay for it . " If there was one thing the poor folk of these parts understood , it was the need for a man to keep out of the way of troops on the march . In a few moments a bargain was struck , the dog was hauled back into the hut and tied up , and I was picking my way gingerly across the slippery logs , leaving Ralf to tend the horses and tether them on the driest piece of ground he could find . Our host 's name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black hair and a black bristle of beard . His shoulders and arms looked immensely strong , but he limped badly from a leg which had been broken , then set by guessworkand left to knit crooked . His wife , who was probably little more than thirty , was white-haired and bent double on herself with rheumatism ; she looked and moved like an old woman , and her face was drawn into tight lines round a toothless mouth . The hut was cramped and foul-smelling , and I would rather have slept in the open , but the evening had turned chilly , and neither Ralf nor I wished to spend a night out in the sodden forest . So when we had had our89fill of black bread and broth we accepted the space of floor offered us , and prepared to lie down wrapped in our cloaks , and take what rest we could . I had mixed a potion for the woman , and she was already asleep , huddled against the other wall under a pile of skins , but Nidd made no move to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again into the night , as if expecting someone . Ralf 's eyes met mine , and his brows lifted ; his hand moved towards his dagger . I shook my head . I had heard the light , quick footsteps on the causeway . The dog made no sound , but his tail beat the floor . The curtain of rough-tanned deerhide was pushed aside from the doorway , and a boy came running in , his mouth one huge grin in a filthy face . He stopped short when he saw Ralf and me , but his father said something in patois and the boy , still eyeing us curiously , dumped the bundle of faggots he carried on the table and undid the thong that held it together . Then , with a swift wary look at me , he pulled from the middle of the faggots a dead fowl , a few strips of salted pork , a bundle which he shook out to reveal a pair of good leather trews , and a well-sharpened knife of the kind issued to the soldiers of the King 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . The man stood watchful , but made no move , and after a moment the boy dropped the knife into my palm . I weighed it in my hand , considering . Then I laughed and dropped it point down , to the table . It stuck there beside the fowl , quivering . " You 've had good hunting tonight , have n't you ? That 's easier than waiting for the wild duck to flight in at dawn . So , the King 's army lies nearby ? How near ? " The boy merely stared , too shy to answer , but with the help of his father I got the information bit by bit . It was not reassuring . The army had made camp barely five miles away . The boy had lurked in a tree at the forest 's edge , watching his chance to steal food , and had overheard90scraps of talk among the men who had gone in among the trees to relieve themselves . It seemed , if the boy had rightly understood what he had heard , that though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its way in the morning , a troop was to be detached and sent directly to Caerleon , with a message for the commander there . They would obviouslygo by the quickest way , the river crossing . They would certainly commandeer whatever boats were available . I looked at Ralf . He was already fastening his cloak . I nodded , and turned to Nidd . " We must go , I 'm afraid . We must get to the ferry before the King 's troops , and no doubt they 'll ride at first light . We 'll have to leave now . Can the boy guide us ? " The boy would do anything , it seemed , for the copper penny I gave him , and he knew all the ways through the marsh . We thanked our host , left the fee and medicines we had promised , and were soon on our way , with the boy  --  whose name was Ger  --  at my horse 's head . There were stars , and a quarter moon , but hazed over with fitful cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy never hesitated . He seemed able to see even in the dark under the trees . The beasts trod softly enough on the forest floor , but the boy made no sound at all . It was difficult to tell , what with the dark , the bad going and the winding track , what kind of distance we were covering . It seemed a long time before the trees dwindled and thinned , and the way stretched clearer ahead of us . As the moon grew stronger , the clouds diffusing her pale light , I could see more clearly . We were still in the marsh ; water gleamed on either hand , islanded with blackness . Underfoot mud pulled and sucked at the horses ' hoofs . Rushes swished and rustled shoulder high . There was a noise of frogs everywhere , and now and again a splash as something took to the water . Once , with a clap and a call and a flash of white , 91a feeding bird shot off not a yard in front of my horse 's hoofs , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reins , I must have been unseated and thrown into the water . After that my horse picked his way nervously , starting even at the faint sucking sounds from the pools where the marshlights flickered and bubbles popped under the wisps of vapour which hung and floated over the water . Here and there , sticking up black out of the bog , was the stripped skeleton of a tree . It was a strange , dead-looking landscape , and smelling of death . From Ralf 's silence , I knew that he was afraid . But our guide , at my horse 's head , plodded on through the wanderingmists and the wisps of fire that were the souls of his fathers . The only sign he gave was when , at a fork in the track , we passed a hollow tree , a thick trunk twice the height of a man , with a gaping hole in the bark , and inside this a greenish glow that , with the help of the moonlight , faintly lit a crouching shape of eyes , mouth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the NamelessOne , who sits staring from her hollowed log like the owl who is her creature ; and in front of her , decaying with the greenish glow that folk call enchanter 's light , an offering of fish , laid in an oyster shell . I heard Ralf 's breath go in , and his hand flickered in a defensive gesture . The boy Ger , without even looking aside , muttered the word under his breath , and held straight on . Half an hour later , from the head of a rise of solid ground , we saw the wide , moonlit stretch of the estuary , and smelled salt on the clean and moving air . Down by the shore where the ferry plied there was a red glimmer of light , the flame of the cresset on the wharf . The road to it , clear in the moonlight , crossed the ridge not far from us and ran straight downhill to the shore . We drew rein , but when I turned to thank the boy I found that he had already vanished , melting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandering marshlights fading . We headed our weary horses down towards the distant glimmer . When we reached the ferry we found that our luck had deserted us as swiftly and as decisively as our guide . The cresset burned on its post at the strip of shingle where the ferry beached , but the ferry was not there . Straining my ears , I thought I heard , above the ripple of water , the splashing of oars some way out on the estuary . I gave a hail , but got no reply . " It looks as if he expects to come back to this side soon , " said Ralf , who had been exploring . " There 's a fire in the hut , and he 's left the door open . " " Then we 'll wait inside , " I said . " It 's not likely the King 's troops will set out before cock-crow . I ca n't imagine his message to Caerleon is as urgent as that , or he 'd have sent a rider posting last night . See to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The ferryman 's hut was empty , but the remains of a fire still glowed in the ring of stones that served for a hearth . There was a pile of dry kindling beside it , and before long a comforting tongue of flame licked up through the wood and set the turf glowing . Ralf was soon dozing in the warmth , while I sat watching the flames and listening for the return of the ferry . But the sound that roused me was not the sound of a keel grating on shingle ; it was the soft and distant thudding of a troop of horse coming at the canter . Before my hand could reach Ralf 's shoulder to shake him awake , he was on his feet . " Quick , my lord , if we ride fast along the shingle  --  the tide 's not full yet  --  " " No . They 'd hear us , and in any case the horses are too tired . How far away would you say they were ? " He was at the door in two strides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile . Less . They 'll be here in a few minutes . What are you going to do ? We ca n't hide . They 'll see the horses , and the country 's open as a map in the sand . " This was true . The road down which the horsemen were coming ran straight up from the shore to the head of the ridge . To right and left of it lay the marshlands , glinting with water , and white with mist . Behind us the estuary stretched glimmering , throwing back the moonlight . " What you ca n't run from , you must face , " I said . " No , not like that "  --  as the boy 's hand went to his sword  --  " not against King 's men , and we would n't stand a chance anyway . There 's a better way . Get the bags , will you ? " I was already stripping off my stained and ragged tunic . He threw me a doubtful look , but ran to obey . " You wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't intend to try . When fate forces your hand , Ralf , go with it . It looks as if I may get to see the King sooner than I 'd hoped to . " " Here ? But you  --  he -- the Queen  --  " " The Queen 's secret will be safe . I 've been thinking how to deal with this if it happened . We 'll let them think we 've just come south from Maridunum , hoping to see the King . " " But the ferryman ? If they check with him ? " " It could be awkward , but we 'll have to chance it . Why should they , after all ? Even if they do , I can deal with it . Men will believe anything of the King 's enchanter , Ralf , even that he could cross the estuary on a cloud , or ford it knee high at flood-tide . " While we were talking he had unstrapped one of the saddle-bags and pulled out of it the decent dark robe and stitched doeskin boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I bent over the bucket of water by the door and swilled the weariness of the journey and the stench of the marshlander 's hut off my face and hands . Whenfate forces you , I had said to Ralf . I felt my blood running fast and light with the hope that this stroke  --  ill luck we had thought it  --  might be the first cold , dangerous touch of the god 's hand . When the troop rode up , halting with a clatter and slither of shingle in front of the ferryman 's hut , I was standing waiting for them in the open doorway , with the firelight behind me , and the bright moonlight catching the royal Dragon at my shoulder . Behind me in the shadows I heard Ralf mutter thankfully : " Not Cornwall 's men . They wo n't know me . " " But they 'll know me , " I said . " That 's Ynyr 's badge . They 're Welshmen from Guent . " The officer was a tall man , with a thin hawk face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not remember him , but he stared , saluted , and said : " By the Raven himself ! How came you here , sir ? " " I must have words with the King . How far away is his camp ? " As I spoke , a kind of ripple of movement went among the troop , horses fidgeting and one suddenly rearing as if curbed too nervously . The officer snapped something over his shoulder , then turned back to me . I heard him swallow before he answered me . " Some eight miles off , sir . " There was something more here , I thought , than surprise at finding me in this deserted place , and the awe that I was accustomed to meeting among common men . I felt Ralf move up close behind me to my shoulder . A half-glance showed me the sparkle in his eyes ; show Ralf danger , and he came alive . The officer said abruptly : " Well , my lord , this has saved us something . We were on the way to Caerleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bring you to him . " 9495 I caught the sharp intake of Ralf 's breath . I thought fast , through a sudden quickening of the heart . This explained the soldiers ' reaction ; they thought the King 's enchanter must have had magical foreknowledge of the King 's will . On a plainer level , it settled the matter of the ferryman ; if this troop was an escort for me , they would not now need to cross the ferry . Ralf could buy the man 's silence when I had gone with the troops . I would not risk taking the boy back within reach of Uther 's displeasure . There was no harm in driving the point home . I said pleasantly : " So I have saved you the trip to Bryn Myrddin . I 'm glad . Where did the King plan to receive me ? At Viro- conium ? I did n't think he meant to lie at Caerleon . " " Nor does he , " said the man . I could hear the effort of control , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You  --  you knew the King was travelling north to Viro- conium ? " " How not ? " I asked him . From the edge of my eye I saw the nods and head-turning among the men that also asked How not ? " But I had a mind to talk to him sooner than that . Did he charge you with a letter for me ? " " No , sir . Instructions to take you to him , that was all . " He leaned forward in the saddle . " I think it was on account of the message he got last evening from Cornwall . Ill news , I think , though he told no one what it was . He seemed angry . Then he gave the order to fetch you . " He waited , looking down at me as if I would be sure to know the contents of the message . I was only too afraid that I did . Someone had recognized us , or made a guess , and sent to tell the King . The messenger could easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to happen between Uther and myself , I had to get Ralf out of danger first . And although I was not afraid for the Queen at Uther 's hands , there were others  --  Maeve , Caw , Marcia , the child himself . . . . The skin on my nape stung and roused 9697like a dog 's that smells danger . I took a long , steadying breath and looked about me . " You have a spare horse ? My beast is weary and must be led . My servant will rest here , and go back at first light with the ferry , to make ready for me at home . The King will no doubt see me escorted there when my business with him is done . " The officer 's voice , apologetic but definite , cut across Ralf 's furious whisper of dissent . " If it please you , sir , you will both come . Those were my orders . We have horses . Shall we ride ? " At the lift of his hand the men were already moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . He had his orders , and I would risk more by arguing than by obeying . Besides , every minute 's delay might bring the ferry back . I had heard nothing , but the fellow must have seen the soldiers ' torches , and might even now be heading back for custom . A trooper came up with the spare horses and took our own beasts in hand . We mounted . The officer barked an order , and the troop wheeled and fell in behind us . We were barely two hundred paces from the shore when I heard , clear behind me , the sound of a boat 's bottom grating on shingle . No one else paid any attention . The officer was busy telling me about the council to be held in the north , and behind me I could hear Ralf 's voice , gay and amused , promising the troopers " a skin of sloe wine , the best stuff you ever tasted . A recipe of my master 's . It 's what they give you with the rations now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what comes of sending messages for a wizard , who knows everything that 's happened before it 's even happened at all . . . . " The King was abed when we arrived at the camp , and we were lodged  --  and guarded  --  in a tent not far from his . We said nothing to each other that could not be overheard . And , danger or no danger , it was the most comfortable lodging we had had since we left the inn at Camelford . Ralf was soon asleep , but I lay wakeful , watching the empty dark , listening to the little wind which had sprung up throwing handfuls of rain against the walls of the tent , and telling myself : " It must happen . It must happen . The god sent me the vision . The child was given to me . " But the dark stayed empty , and the wind swept the tent walls and withdrew into silence , and nothing came . I turned my head on its uneasy pillow , and saw dimly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned over withoutspeaking , and soon his breathing slackened again into sleep . The King received me alone , soon after dawn . He was armed and ready for the road , but bareheaded . His helmet with its gold circlet lay on a stool beside his chair , and his sword and shield stood propped against the box which held the travelling altar of Mithras that he always carried with him . The tent was hung with skins and worked curtains , but it was chilly , and draughts crept everywhere . Outside were the sounds of the army breaking camp . I could hear the snap and flutter of the Dragon standard by the entrance . He greeted me briefly . His face still wore the bleak ex- pression I remembered , empty of friendliness , but I could see neither anger nor enmity there . His look was cool and summing , his voice brisk . " You and your Sight have saved me a little trouble , Merlin . " I bent my head . If he asked no questions I need answer none . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me ? " " Last time we spoke together I was harsh with you . I have since thought that this was perhaps unworthy of a king to whom you had just done a service . " " You were bitter at the Duke 's death . " " As to that , he fought against his King . Whatever the circumstances , he raised a sword to me , and he died . It 's done , and it is past . We , you and I , are left with the future . This is what concerns me now . " " The child , " I said , assenting. 98 99The blue eyes narrowed . " Who sent you the news ? Or is this still the Sight ? " " Ralf brought the news . When he left your court , he came to me . He serves me now . " He considered that for a moment , his brows drawing together , then smoothing as he found no harm in it . I watched him . He was a tall man , with reddish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made him look younger than his years . It was just over a year , I thought , since my father had died and Uther had lifted the Pendragon standard . Kingshiphad steadied him ; I could see discipline in his face as well as the lines drawn there by passion and temper , and kingship along with his victories clothed him like a cloak . He moved a hand , dismissively , and I knew that Ralf need fear him no longer . " I said the past was past , but there is one thing I must ask you . On that night in Tintagel when this child was begotten , I bade you keep away from me and trouble me no more . Do you remember ? " " I remember . " " And you replied that you would not trouble me again , that I should not need your service again . Was this foresight , or only anger ? " I said quietly : " When I spoke , I spoke the words that came to me . I thought they were foresight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout that night I took as if they came straight from the gods . Why do you ask ? Have you sent for me now to command service of me ? " " To ask it , rather . " " As a prophet ? " " No . As a kinsman . " " Then I 'll tell you , as a kinsman , that it was not prophecy that night , nor was it anger , sir , but only grief . I was grieving for my servant 's death , and for the deaths of Gorlois and hisI00companions . But now , as you say , the past is past . If I can serve you , you have only to command me . " But , I thought , as I waited for him to speak , if it was no prophecy , then none of that night was God 's and He never spoke to me . No , I had told the truth when I said that Uther would have no need of my service ; it had not been Uther whom I served that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remembered the words of the other King , my father : " You and I between us , Merlin , we will make such a king as the world has never known . " It was the dead King , and the one still unborn , who commanded me . If there had been any hesitation in my manner , Uther had not noticed it . He nodded , then set his elbow on his knee and his chin on his fist and thought for a while , frowning . " There is one other thing I said that night . I told you that I would not acknowledge the child begotten then . I spoke in anger , but now I speak coldly , after taking thought and counsel , and I tell you , Merlin , that I 'm still of the same mind . " He seemed to expect an answer , but I was silent . He went on , half irritably : " Do n't misunderstand me , I do n't doubt the Queen . I believe her when she tells me that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The child is mine , yes , but he can not be my heir , nor can he be reared in my house . If the child is a girl , then none of this matters , but if it is a boy it would be folly to rear him as heir to the High Kingdom , when men will only have to count on their fingers to say that Gorlois begot him of his wife Ygraine , half a month before the High King married her . " He looked at me . " You must know this as well as I do , Merlin . You have lived in kings ' houses . There will always be those who doubt his birth , so there will always be those who would try to pull him off the throne in favour of men with a betterIOIclaim , ' and God knows there will always be claims in plenty . And the best claims will be those of my other sons . So , even brought up as my bastard at my court , the child is dangerous . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my other children . By the Light , this is not unknown . I will not have my house a battleground . I must beget myself anotherson , an undoubted heir , conceived in wedlock to the satisfaction of all men , and reared at my side when the kingdomis settled and the Saxon wars are over . Do you accept this ? " " You are the King , Uther , and the child 's father . " It was hardly an answer , but he nodded as if I had agreed . " There is more . This child is not only dangerous , he 'll be a victim of danger . If men can say that he was not mine , that he must have been begotten by Gorlois on Ygraine his wife , then it follows that he is the true son of the Duke of Cornwall , with a claim on the younger son 's portion of the lands which Cador holds , now that I 've confirmedhim as Duke in his father 's place . You see ? King 's son or Duke 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there are some who 'd follow him quickly enough . " " Is Cador loyal to you ? " " I trust him . " He gave a short laugh . " So far . He 's young , but hard-headed . He wants Cornwall , and he wo n't risk anything that could lose it  --  yet . But later , who knows ? And when I am gone . . . " He let it hang . " No , Cador is not my enemy , but there are others who are . " " Who ? " " God knows , but what king was ever without them ? Even Ambrosius . . . they 're still saying he died of poison . I know you told me this was not true , but even so I have Ulfin taste my food . Ever since I took Octa and Eosa prisoner , they 've been the storm center for every disaffected leader whoIO2thinks he can see his way to a crown like Vortigern'sbacked. with Saxon forces , and paid for with British lives and lands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to raise the Federates against me ? Or kill them , and give their sons in Germany a grievance to be wiped out in blood ? No , Octa and his cousin are my hostages . Without them , Colgrim and Badulf would have been here long since , and the Saxon Shore would have burst its bounds and be lapping at Ambrosius ' Wall . As it is , I 'm buying time . You ca n't tell me anything , Merlin ? Have you heard anything , or seen ? " He was not asking for prophecy ; Uther looked askance and white-eyed at things of the Otherworld , like a dog that sees the wind . I shook my head . " Of your enemies ? Nothing , except that when Ralf came to me after leaving your court , he was set upon , and nearly killed . The men had no badge . They may have thought he was your messenger , or perhaps the Queen 's . Troops from the barracks hunted the woods , but found no trace of them . More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if I ever learn anything I will tell you . " He gave a brief nod , then went on , slowly , choosing his words . His manner was abrupt , almost reluctant . For myself , my mind was spinning , and I had to fight to hold myself calm and steady . We were coming now onto the battleground , but it must be a very different battle from the one I had planned for . " You and I , " he had said . He would hardly have sent for me unless I was to have some concern in the child 's future . He was going over the same ground that Ygraine and I had covered . " . . . so you see why , if the child is a boy , he can not stay with me , yet if I send him away , he is beyond my power to protect . But protection he must have . Bastard or no , he is my child and the Queen 's , and if we have no103other sons he must one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned up a hand . " You see where this leaves me . I must consign him to a guardian who will keep him in safety for the first few years of his life . . . at least until this torn kingdom is settled and safe , and in the hands of strong and loyal allies , and my own declared heirs . " He waited again for my agreement . I nodded , then said , carefully neutral : " Have you chosen this guardian ? " " Yes . Budec . " So the Queen had been right , and the decision was made . But still he had sent for me . I held myself still and said , so flatly that it sounded indifferent : " It was the obvious choice . " He shifted in his chair and cleared his throat . I saw with some surprise that he was uneasy , nervous even . He even looked half pleased at my commendation of his choice . The knowledge steadied me . I realized that I had been so singleminded  --  sowrapped in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate  --  that I had seen Uther falsely as the enemy . He was not so concerned : the plain fact was that Uther was a war-leader harassed perpetually by the strife in and around his borders , working desperately against time to patch a dam here , a sea-wall there , against the piling floodwater ; and to him this affair of the child , though it might prove one day vitally important , was now little but a rub in the way of major issues , something he wanted out of the way and delegated . He had spoken without emotion , and indeed had set the thing out fairly enough . It was possible that he had sent for me , genuinely , to ask my advice , as his brother had been used to do . In which case . . . I wetted dry lips , and schooled myself to listen quietly , an adviser with a man beset by trouble . He was speaking again , something about a letter . The message which had come yesterday . He pointed to the stool beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down in anger . " Did you know about this ? " I picked the letter up and smoothed it out . It was brief , a message from Brittany , that had been sent to the King at Tintagel and brought here after him . King Budec had fallen sick of a fever , it said , during the summer . He had seemed on the way to recovery , then , towards the end of August , he had quite suddenly died . The letter finished with protestationsof formal friendship from the new king , Hoel , Uther 's " devoted cousin and ally ... " I looked up . Uther had sat back in his chair , shifting a fold of the scarlet mantle over his arm . Everything seemed quite still . Outside , the wind had dropped . The sounds of the camp came from far away , faintly . Uther 's chin was sunk on his chest , and he was watching me with a mixture of worry and impatience . I was noncommittal . " This is heavy news . Budec was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , even if it had not destroyed my plans . I was preparing to send messages even when this letter came . Now I ca n't see my way clear . Have they told you that I go to a council of kings at Viroconium ? " " Audagus told me . " Audagus was the officer who had escorted us from the ferry . He threw out a hand . " Then you see how much I want to turn aside to deal with this . But it must be dealt with now . This is why I sent for you . " I flicked the seal with a forefinger . " You wo n't send the child to Hoel , then ? He swears himself your devoted cousin and ally . " " He may be my devoted cousin and ally , but he 's also a  --  " Uther used a phrase that became a soldier rather than a king in council . " I never liked him , nor he me . Oh , Mithras knows he would never mean harm to a son of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he might not be able to protectI05the boy from his ill-wishers . No , I 'll not send him to Hoel . But what other court can I send him to ? Reckon it for yourself . " He told over a few names , all powerful men , all of them kings whose lands lay in the southern part of the country , behind the Wall of Ambrosius . " Well ? Do you see my problem ? If he goes to one of the nobles or petty kings here in safe country he could still be in danger from an ambitiousman ; or worse , become a tool of treachery and re-bellion . " " So ? " " So I come to you . You are the only man who can steer me between these clashing rocks . On the one hand , the child must be sworn and acknowledged my own , in case there is no other heir . On the other , he must be taken away out of danger for himself and the kingdom , and brought up in ignorance of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He turned over a hand on his knee and asked me as simply as he had asked me once before : " Can you help me ? " I answered him as simply . The bewilderment , the confusedwhirl of thought , settled suddenly into a pattern , like coloured leaves blown down into a tapestry on the grass when the spinning wind drops still . " Of course . You need wreck no part of your kingdom on either of these rocks . Listen , and I will tell you how . You told me you had taken counsel . ' Other men , then , know of your plans to send the boy to Budec ? " " Yes . " " Have you spoken to anyone of this letter , and your doubts of Hoel ? " " No . " " Good . You will give it out that your plan stays as formerly , and that the boy will go to Hoel 's court at Kerrec . You will write to Hoel requesting this . Have someone makeIo6all arrangements to send the boy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See that it is given out that I will accompany him there myself . " He was frowning , intent , and I could see protest in his face , but he made none . He said merely : " And ? " " Next , " I said , " I must be at Tintagel for the birth . Who is her physician ? " " Gandar . " He seemed about to say something more , then changed his mind and waited . " Good . I 'm not suggesting I should attend her . " I smiled . " In view of what I shall suggest , that might lead to some rather dangerous rumours . Now , will you be there yourself for the lying-in ? " " I shall try , but it 's doubtful . " " Then I shall be there to attest the child 's birth , as well as Gandar and the Queen 's women , and whoever you can appoint . If it is a boy , the news will be sent to you by beacon , and you will declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ default of a son begotten in wedlock , your heir until another prince shall be born . " He took some time over that , frowning , and obviously reluctant to commit himself . But it was only the conclusion of what he had himself said to me . Finally he nodded and spoke a little heavily : " Very well . It is true . Bastard or not , he is my heir until I get another . Go on . " " Meantime the Queen will keep her chamber , and once he has been seen and sworn to , the child will be taken back to the Queen 's apartments and kept there , seen only by Gandar and the women . Gandar can arrange this . I myself will leave openly , by the main gate and the bridge . Then after dark I shall go down secretly to the postern gate on the cliff , to receive the child . " " And take him where ? " " To Brittany . No , wait . Not to Hoel , nor by the ship107which everyone will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall take him to someone I know in Brittany , on the edge of Hoel 's kingdom . He will be safe , and well cared for . You have my word for it , Uther . " He brushed that aside as if there had been no need for me to say it . He was already looking lighter , glad to be relieved of a care that must , among the weighty cares of the kingdom , seem trivial , and  --  with the child still only a weight in a woman 's womb  --  unreal . " I 'll have to know where you take him . " " To my own nurse , who reared me and the other royal children , bastard and true alike , in the nurseries at Maridunum . Her name is Moravik , and she 's a Breton . After the sack by Vortigern she went home to her people . She has married since . While the child is sucking , I can think of no better place . He wo n't be looked for in such a humble home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he will be hidden and unknown . " " And Hoel ? " " He will know . He must . Leave Hoel to me . " Outside a trumpet sounded . The sun was growing stronger , and the tent was warm . He stirred , and flexed his shoulders , as a man does when he lays off his armour . " And when men find that the child is not on the royal ship , but has vanished ? What do we tell them ? " " That for fear of the Saxons in the Narrow Sea the prince was sent , not by the royal ship , but privily , with Merlin , to Brittany . " " And when it is found he is not at Hoel 's court ? " " Gandar and Marcia will swear to it that I took the child safely . What will be said I ca n't tell you , but there 's no one who will doubt me , or that the child is safe as long as he 's under my protection . And what my protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enchantments andIo8vanishings , and wait for the child to reappear when my spells are lifted . " He said prosaically : " They 're more like to say the ship foundered and the child is dead . " " I shall be there to deny it . " " You mean you wo n't stay with the boy ? " " I must not , not yet . I 'm known . " " Then who will be with him ? You said he would be guarded . " For the first time I hesitated fractionally . Then I met his eyes . " Ralf . " He looked startled , then angry , then I saw him thinking back past his anger . He said slowly : " Yes . I was wrong there , too . He will be true . " " There is no one truer . " " Very well , I am content . Make what arrangements you please . It 's in your hands . You of all men in Britain will know how to protect him . " His hands came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is settled . Before we march today I shall send a message to the Queen telling her what I have decided . " I thought it wise to ask : " Will she accept it ? It 's no easy thing for a woman to bear , even a queen . " " She knows my decision , and she will do as I say . There 's one thing , though , where she 'll have her way ; she wants the child baptized a Christian . " I glanced at the Mithras altar against the tent wall . " And you ? " He lifted his shoulders . " What does it matter ? He will never be King . And if he were , then he would pay service where he had to , in the sight of the people . " A hard , straight look . " As my brother did . " If it was a challenge I declined it , saying merely : " And the name ? " 109 " Arthur . " The name was strange to me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before . Perhaps there had been Roman blood in Ygraine 's family . . . The Artorii ; that would be it . But that was not where I had heard the name . . . . " I 'll see to it , " I said . " And now , with your permission , I 'll send the Queen a letter , too . She 'll lie the easier for being assured of my loyalty . " He nodded , then stood up and reached for his helmet . He was smiling , a cold ghost of the old malicious smile with which he had baited me when I was a child . " It 's strange , is n't it , Merlin the bastard , that I should talk so easily of trusting the body of my own ill-begotten son to the one man in the kingdom whose claim to the throne is better than his ? Are you not flattered ? " " Not in the least . You 'd be a fool if you did n't know by now that I have no ambitions towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastard any , will you ? " He turned his head , shouting for a servant , then back to me . " And none of your damned magic , either . " " If he 's your son , " I said dryly , " he wo n't take very kindly to magic . I shall teach him nothing except what he has the need and the right to know . You have my word on it . " On that we parted . Uther would never like me , nor I him , but there was a kind of cold mutual respect between us , born of our shared blood and the different love and service we had given to Ambrosius . I should have known that he and I were linked in this as closely as the two sides of the same counter , and that we would move together whether we willed it or not . The gods sit over the board , but it is men who move under their hands for the mating and the kill . I should have known ; but I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stars that I had forgotten to listen for it in the counsels of nmen . Ralf was waiting , alone in the guarded tent . When I told him the result of my talk with the King , he was silent a long time . Then he said : " So it will all happen , just as you said it would . Did you expect it to come like this ? When they brought us here last night , I thought you were afraid . " " I was , but not in the way you mean . " I expected him to ask how , but oddly , he seemed to understand . His cheek flushed and he busied himself over some detail of packing . " My lord , I have to tell you . . . " His voice was stifled . " I have been very wrong about you . At first I  --  because you are not a man of war , I thought  --  " " You thought I was a coward ? I know . " he looked up sharply . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obviously , was almost as bad as cowardice . I smiled . " When I was a child among budding warriors , I grew used to it . Besides , I have never been sure myself how much courage I have . " He stared at that , then burst out : " But you are afraid of nothing ! All the things that have happened  --  this journeyyou'dhave thought we were riding out on a summer morning , instead of going by paths filled with wild beasts and outlaws . And when the King 's men took us  --  even if he is your uncle , that 's not to say you 'd never be in danger from him . Everyone knows the King 's unchancy to cross . But you just looked cold as ice , as if you expected him to do what you wanted , just as everyone does ! You , afraid ? You 're not afraid of anything that 's real . " " That 's what I mean , " I said . " I 'm not sure how much courage is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '  --  knowing they wo n't kill you . But foreknowledge hasIIIits own terrors , Ralf . Death may not lie just at the next corner , but when one knows exactly when it will come , and how ... It 's not a comfortable thought . " " You mean you do know ? " " Yes . At least , I think it 's my death that I see . At any rate it is darkness , and a shut tomb . " He shivered . " Yes , I see . I 'd rather fight in daylight , even thinking I might die perhaps tomorrow . At least it 's always perhaps tomorrow , ' never now . ' Will you wear the doeskin boots for riding , my lord , or change them now ? " " Change them . Thank you . " I sat down on a stool and stretched out a foot for him . He knelt to pull off my boots . " Ralf , there is something else I must tell you . I told the King you were with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . " He looked up at that , struck still . " You told him that ? What did he say ? " " That you were a true man . He agreed , and approved you . " He sat back on his heels , my boots in his hands , gaping at me . " He has had time to think , Ralf , as a king should think . He has also had time  --  as kings do  --  to still his conscience . He sees Gorlois now as a rebel , and the past as done with . If you wish to go back into his service he will receive you kindly , and give you a place among his fighting men . " He did not answer , but stooped forward again and busied himself fastening my boots . Then he got to his feet and pulled back the flap of the tent , calling to a man to bring up the horses . " And hurry . My lord and I ride now for the ferry . " " You see ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given . And yet who can say it is not as much a part of theII2pattern as the chance ' of Budec 's death ? " I got to my feet , stretching , and laughed . " By all the living gods , I 'm glad that things are moving now . And gladder for the moment of one thing more than any other . " " That you 're to get the child so easily ? " " Oh , that , of course . No , I really meant that now at last I can shave off this damnable beard . " 11310 By the time Ralf and I reached Maridunum my plans , so far as could be at this stage , were made . I sent him by the next ship to Brittany , with letters of condolence to Hoel , and with messages to supplement the King 's . One letter , which Ralf carried openly , merely repeated the King 's re- quest that Hoel should give shelter to the baby during his infancy ; the other , which Ralf was to deliver secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the charge of the child , nor would we come by the royal ship or at the time ostensibly fixed . I begged his assistance for Ralf in all the arrangements for the secret journey at Christmas that I planned . Hoel , easy-going and lazy by nature , and less than fond of his cousin Uther , would be so relieved , I knew , that he would help Ralf and myself in every way known to him . With Ralf gone , I myself set out for the north . It was obvious that I would not be able to leave the baby too long in Brittany ; the refuge with Moravik would serve for a while , till men 's interest died down , but after that it might be dangerous . Brittany was the place ( as I had said to the Queen ) where Uther 's enemies would look for the child ; the fact that the child was not  --  had never been  --  at his publicly declared refuge at Hoel 's court might make them believe that the talk of Brittany had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no real trail would lead them to Moravik 's obscure village . But this was only safe as long as the boy was an infant . As soon as he grew and began to go about , some query or rumour might start . I knew how easily this could happen , and for the child of a poor house to be so cared for and guarded as must happen here , it would be very easy for some question to start a rumour , and a rumour to grow too quickly into a guess at the truth . More than this , once the child was weaned from women and the nursery , he would have to be trained , if not as a young prince , then as a young noble and a warrior . It was obvious that Bryn Myrddin , on no count , could be his home : he must have the comfort and safety of a noble house around him . In the end I had thought of a man who had been a friend of my father 's , and whom I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Galava , one of the nobles who fought under King Coel of Rheged , Uther 's most considerable ally in the north . Rheged is a big kingdom , stretching from the mountainous spine of Britain right to the western coast , and from the Wall of Hadrian in the north clear down to the plain of Deva . Galava , which Ector held under Coel , lies about thirty miles in from the sea , in the north-west corner of the kingdom . Here there is a wild . and mountainous tract of country , all hills and water and wild forest ; in fact , one of the names it goes by is the ' Wild Forest . Ector 's castle lies on the flat land at the end of one of the long lakes that fill these valleys . There was in past time a Roman fortress there , one of a chain on the military road running from Glannaventa on the coast to join the main way from Luguvallium to York . Between Galava and the port of Glannaventa lie steep hills and wild passes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . When Uther had talked of fostering the child in some safe castle he had thought only of the rich , long-settled lands inside Ambrosius ' Wall , but even without his fears of the nobles ' loyalty , I would have counted that country dangerous ; these were the very lands that the Saxons , immuredI4 I15along the Shore , coveted most dearly . It was these lands which , I guessed , they would fight for first and most bitterly . In the north , in the heart of Rheged , where no one would look for him and where the Wild Forest itself would guard him , the boy could grow up as safely as God would allow , and as freely as a deer . Ector had married a few years back . His wife was called Drusilla , of a Romano-British family from York . Her father , Faustus , had been one of the city magistrates who had de- fended the city against Hengist 's son Octa , and had been one of those urgent to advise the Saxon leader to yield himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father 's army . It was in York that he had met Drusilla , and had married her . They were both Christians , and this was possibly why their paths and Uther 's had not often crossed . But I , along with my father , had been to Faustus ' house in York , and Ambrosius had there taken part in many long dis- cussions about the settlement of the northern provinces . The castle at Galava was well protected , being built on the site of the old Roman fort , with the lake before it , and a deep river on the one hand , and the wild mountains near . It could be approached only from the open water , or by one of the easily watched and defended valley passes . But it did not have the air of a fortress . Trees grew near it , now rich with autumn , and there were boats out and men fishing where the river flowed deep and still through its sedgy flat- lands . The green meadows at the waters ' head were full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castle walls as there had been in the Roman Peace . Two full miles beyond the castle walls lay a monastery , and so secluded were the valleys that right up on the heights above the tree-line , where the land stretched bare of all but short grass and stones , one saw the strange little blue-fleeced sheep that breed in Rheged , with some shepherd boy cheerfully braving the wolves and 116 fierce hill foxes with the protection of a stick and a single dog . I travelled alone , and quietly . Though the hated beard had gone , and with it the heavy disguise , I managed the journey unnoticed and unrecognized , and came to Galava towards late afternoon on a bright , crisp October day . The great gates were wide open , giving on a paved yard where men and boys were unloading a wagon of straw . The oxen stood patiently , chewing their cud ; near them a lad was watering a pair of sweating horses . Dogs barked and skirmished , and hens pecked busily among the fallen straw . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps up to the main door someone had planted beds of marigolds , which blazed orange and yellow in the late sunshine . It looked like a prosperous farm rather than a fortress , but through an open door I could see the rows of freshly burnished weapons , and from behind one of the high walls came shouted orders and the clash of men drilling . I had barely paused between the posts of the archway when the porter was barring my way and asking my business . I handed him my Dragon brooch , wrapped in a small pouch , and bade him take it to his master . He came hurrying back to the gate within minutes , and the chamberlain , puffing in his wake , showed me straight in to Count Ector . Ector was not much changed . He was a man of medium height , growing now into middle age ; if my father had lived they would have been of an age now , I reckoned , which made him something over forty . He had a brown beard going grey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His wife was more than ten years younger ; she was tall , a statuesque woman still in her twenties , reserved and a little shy , but with smoky-blue eyes that belied her cool manner and distant speech . Ector had the air of a contented man . He received me alone , in a small chamber where spearsI17and bows stood stacked against the walls , and the hearth was four deep in deer-hounds . The fire was heaped as high as a funeral pyre with pine logs blazing , and small wonder , for the narrow windows were unglazed and open to the brisk October air , and the wind whined like another hound in the bowstrings that were stacked there . He gripped my arms with a bearlike welcome , beaming . " Merlinus Ambrosius ! Here 's a pleasure indeed ! What is it , two years ? Three ? There 's been water under the bridge , aye , and stars fallen , since we last met , eh ? Well , you 're welcome , welcome . I ca n't think of any man I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a name for yourself , have n't you ? The tales I 've heard tell . . . Well , well , but you can tell me the truth of it yourself . God 's sweet death , boy , you get more like him by the day ! Thinner , though , thinner . You look as if you 've seen no red meat for a year . Come , sit down by the fire now , and let me send for supper before we talk . " The supper was enormous and excellent , and would have served me ten times over . Ector ate enough for three , and pressed me to finish the rest . While we ate we exchanged news . He had heard of the Queen 's pregnancy , and spoke of it , but for the moment I let it go , and asked him instead what had happened at Viroconium . Ector had attended the King 's council there , and was but newly returned home . " Success ? " he asked , in reply to my question . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coel of Rheged , of course , and all from these lands "  --  he named half a dozen neighbours  --  " except Riocatus of Verterae , who sent to say he was sick . " " I gather you did n't believe it ? " " When I believe anything that jackal says , " said Ector forcibly , " I 'm a spit-licker too . But the wolves were there , all of them , so the scavengers hardly matter . " " Strathclyde ? " " Oh , aye , Caw was there . You know the Picts in theII8western half of his land have been giving trouble  --  when have n't they given trouble , come to that ? But for all Caw 's Pictish himself , he 'll co-operate with any plan that 'll help him keep control of that wild territory of his , so he was well disposed to the idea of the council . He 'll help , I 'm sure of it . Whether he can control that pack of sons he 's sired is another matter . Did you know that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old enough ( you 'd have thought ) to lift a spear , took one of Morien 's girls by force last spring when she was on her way to the monastery her father had promised her to since birth ? He lifted his spear to her easily enough ; by the time her father got the news she was over the border with him , and in no condition for any monastery , however broad-minded . " IIe chuckled . " Morien cried rape , of course , but everyone was laughing , so he made the best of it . Strathclyde had to pay , naturally , and he and Morien sat on opposite benches at Viroconium , and Heuil was n't there at all . Ah , well , but they agreed to sink their differences . King Uther managed it well enough , so what between Rheged and Strathclyde , there 's half the northern frontier solid for the King . " " And the other half ? " I asked . " What about Lot ? " " Lot ? " Ector snorted . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined if it would get him a few more acres for himself . He cares no more for Britain than that hound by the hearthstone . Less . He and his wild brood of brothers sitting on that cold rock of theirs . They 'll fight when it pays them , and that 's all . " He fell silent , scowling at the fire , poking with a foot at the hound nearest him ; it yawned with pleasure , and flattened its ears . " But he talks well , and maybe I 'm blackguarding him . Times are changing , and even barbarians like Lot ought to be able to see that unless we band together with a strong oath , and keep it , it 'll be the Flood Year all over again . " I19He was not referring to an actual flood , but to the year of the great invasion a century ago , when the Picts and Saxons , joined with the Scots from Ireland , poured across Hadrian 's Wall with axe and fire . Maximus commanded then , in Segontium . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain a time of peace , and for himself an empire and a legend . I said : " Lothian is a key to the defense that Uther 's planning , even more than Rheged or Strathclyde . I 'd heard tell  --  I do n't know if it 's true ?  --  that there are Angles settledon the Alaunus , and that the strength of the Anglian Federates south of York along the Abus has doubled since my father 's death ? " " It 's true . " He spoke heavily . " And south of Lothian there 's only Urien on the coast , and he 's another carrion crow , picking at Lot 's leavings . Nay , that may be another one I 'm doing an injustice to . He 's married to Lot 's sister , when all 's done , so he 'd be bound to cry the same way . Talking of which  --  " " Talking of what ? " I asked , as he paused . " Marriage . " He scowled , then began to grin . " If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You knew Uther had a bastard girl , I forget her name , she must be seven or eight years old ? " " Morgause . Yes , I remember her . She was born in Brit-tany . " Morgause was a sideslip of Uther 's by a girl in Brittany who had followed him to Britain hoping , I suppose , for marriage , since she was of good family , and the only woman , so far as anyone knew then for certain , who had borne him a child . ( It had always been a matter of amazement , and a good deal of private and public conjecture among Uther 's troops , how he managed to avoid leaving a train of bastardsI20in his wake like seedlings following the sower down a furrow . But this girl was , to public knowledge , the only one . And I believe to Uther 's knowledge , too . He was a fair man and a generous one , and no girl had suffered any loss worse than maidenhead through him . ) He had acknowledged the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , and after the mother 's marriage to a lord of his household , had taken the girl into his own . I had seen her once or twice in Brittany , a thin pale-haired girl with big eyes and a mouth folded small . " What about Morgause ? " I asked . " Uther was casting out feelers for marrying her to Lot , come the time she 'll be ready for bedding . " I cocked an eyebrow at him . " And what did Lot think about that ? " " Eh , you 'd have laughed to watch him . Black as a wolverineat the suggestion that Uther 's byblow was good enough , but careful to keep his talk sweet in case there 's no other daughter born in the right bed now the King 's wedded . Bastards  --  and their mates  --  have inherited kingdoms before now . Saving your presence , of course . " " Of course . Lot casts his eyes as high as that , then ? " He gave a short nod . " High as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " I digested that , frowning . I had never met Lot ; he was at this time scarcely older than myself  --  somewhere in his early twenties  --  and though he had fought under my father , his path and mine had not crossed . " So Uther wants to tie Lothian to him , and Lot wants to be tied ? Whether it 's for his own ambition or not , it means surely that Lot will fight for the High King when the time comes ? And Lothian is our main bulwark against the Angles and the other invaders from the north . " I2I " Oh , aye , he 'll fight , " said Ector . " Unless the Angles offer him a better bribe than Uther does . " " Do you mean that ? " I was alarmed . Ector , for all his bluff ways , was a shrewd observer , and few men knew more about the changing shifts of power along our shores . " Maybe I was putting it a trifle high . But for my money Lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that spells danger to any overlord who ca n't placate him . " " How is he with Rheged ? " I was thinking of the child to be lodged here perhaps at Galava , with Lot east by north across the Pennines . " Oh , friends , friends . As good friends as two big hounds each with his own full platter of meat . No , it 's not yet a matter for concern , and may never be . So forget it , and drink up . " He drank deeply himself , set down his cup and wiped his mouth . Then he fixed me with a sharp and curious eye . " Well ? You 'd better get to it , boy . You did n't come all this way for a good supper and a brattle with an old farmer . Tell me how I can serve Ambrosius ' son ? " " It is Ambrosius ' nephew you will be serving , " I said , and told him the rest . He heard me out in silence . For all his warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had been a cold-brained and calculatingofficer ; a valuable man in any circumstance , from a pitched fight to a long and careful siege . After a sharp glance of surprise and a lift of the brows when I spoke of the King 's decision and my guardianship of the child , he listened withoutmoving and without taking his eyes off me . When I had finished , he stirred . " Well . . . I 'll say one thing to start with , Merlin ; I 'm glad and proud you should have come to me . You know how I felt about your father . And to tell you the truth , boy "  --  he cleared his throat , hesitated , then looked away into the fire as he spoke  --  " it always sorrowed my heart that you yourself were a bastard . And122that 's between these four walls , I do n't have to tell you . Not that Uther 's made a bad shot at being High King  --  " " A far better shot than I 'd ever have made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that Uther and I , between us , shared out some of the qualities of a good king . It was a dear dream of his that some day , between us , we might fashion one . And this is the one . " Then , as his head went up , " Oh , I know , a baby not yet born . But all the first part has happened as I knew it must happen : a child begotten by Uther and given to me to raise . I know this is the one . I believe he will be such a king as this poor country has never had before , and may never see again . " " Your stars tell you this ? " " It has been written there , certainly , and who writes among the stars but God ? " " Well , God grant it is so . There 's coming a time , Merlin , maybe not next year , or for five years , or even for ten , but it is coming  --  when the Flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time there 's a king here to raise the sword of Maximus against it . " He turned his head sharply . " What 's that ? That sound ? " " Only the wind in the bowstrings . " " I thought it was a harp sounding . Strange . What is it , boy ? Why do you look so ? " " Nothing . " He looked at me doubtfully for a moment longer , then grunted and fell silent , and behind us the long humming stretched out , a cold music , something from the air itself . I remembered how , as a child , I had lain watching the stars and listening for the music which ( I had been told ) they made as they moved . This must , I thought , be how it sounded . A servant came in then with logs to replenish the fire , and the sound died . When he had gone , and the door had shut123behind him , Ector spoke again in quite a different tone . " Well , I 'll do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ; in the next few years I ca n't see that Uther will have much time for him , and for that matter he 'd be hard put to it to keep the child safe . Tintagel might have done , but as you say , there 's Cador there . . . Does the King know that you 've come to me ? " " No . Nor will I tell him , yet . " " Indeed ? " He thought it over for a moment , frowning a little . " Do you think he 'll be content with that ? " " Possibly . I do n't know . He did n't press me too hard about Brittany . I think that just now he wants as little to do with it as need be . The other thing is "  --  I smiled a little wryly  --  " the King and I have a truce declared , but I would n't bank on its staying that way ; and out of sight , out of mind . If I 'm to have anything to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at a fair distance from the High King . " " Aye , I 've heard that , too . It 's never a wise thing to help kings to their heart 's desire . Will the boy be a Christian ? " " The Queen wants it , so he 'll be baptized in Brittany if I can arrange it . He 's to be called Arthur . " " You 'll stand for him ? " I laughed . " I believe the fact that I was never baptized myselfputs me out of the running . " His teeth showed . " I forgot you were a pagan . Well , I 'm glad to hear about the boy . There 'd have been a peck of trouble else . " " Your wife , you mean ? She 's so devout ? " " Poor lass , " he said , " she has nothing else since our second died . There 'll be no more , they say . In fact it will be God 's mercy if we take this boy into our house ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's only three , and the women spoil him . It will be good to have the second child . What did you say his name was to be ? Arthur ? You 'll leave124this with me to talk over with Drusilla ? Though there 's no question , she 'll be as glad as I am to have him . And I can tell you that she 's close-mouthed enough , for all she 's a woman . He 'll be safe with us . " " I was sure of it . It does n't need the stars to tell me that . " But when I began to thank him , he cut me short . " Well , then , that 's settled . We can talk over the details later . I 'll speak with Drusilla tonight . You 'll stay a while , of course ? " " Thank you , but I ca n't  --  no longer than it takes to rest myself and my horse . I have to be at Tintagel again in December , and before that I must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot to be arranged . " " A pity . But you 'll be back . I 'll look forward to it . " He grinned , stirring the hounds again . " I 'll enjoy seeing you installed as tutor to the household , or whatever you think will give you some claim on the boy . And I own I should like to see Cei licked into shape . Maybe he 'll mind his manners with you , if he thinks he can be turned into a toad for disobeying you . " " Bats are my speciality , " I said , smiling . " You are very good , and I 'll never be out of your debt . But I 'll find a place of my own . " " Look , boy , Ambrosius ' son does n't wander the countrysidelooking for a home while I have four walls and a fireplaceto offer him . Why not here ? " " Because I might be recognized , and where Merlin is for the next few years , men will look for Arthur near him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as big as this is too risky , and , with all my thanks to you , four walls are not always the best shelter for such as me . " " Ah , yes . A cave , is n't it ? Well , there are a few hereabouts , they tell me , if you turn the wolves out first . Well , you know your own business . But tell me , what of the125Queen ? You did n't say where she stood in this ? What woman would let her first child be taken from the bed where she bore him , and never try to see him again or make herself known to him ? " " The Queen herself sent for me secretly , and asked me to take him . She has suffered , I know , but it 's the King 's will , and she knows that it 's more than a whim born of anger ; she sees the dangers as well as he . And she is a queen before she is a woman . " I added , carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman for a family , any more than Uther is a family man . They are man and woman for each other , and outside their bed they are King and Queen . It may be that in the future Ygraine will wonder , and ask questions ; but that is with the future . For the moment she is content to let him go . After this we talked on , late into the night , arranging as far as we could the details of the time ahead . Arthur would be left in Brittany until he was three or four years old , then at a safe time of year Ralf would bring him across from Brittany to Ector 's home . " And you ? " asked Ector . " Where will you be ? " " Not in Brittany , for the same reason that I ca n't live here . I shall vanish , Ector . It 's a talent that magicians have . And when I do appear again , it will be somewhere that draws men 's eyes away from Brittany and Galava . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to enlighten him . " Truth to tell , my plans are not yet fixed . Now , I 've kept you out of your bed for long enough . Your wife will be wondering what sort of mystery man you have been closeted with all these hours . I 'll make my apologies when you presentme in the morning . " " And I 'll make my own now , " he said , getting to his feet . " But that 's one apology I enjoy making . You miss a lot , you know , Merlin  --  but then you ca n't know . " 126 " I know , " I said . " You do ? Then you must think it 's worth it , life withoutwomen ? " " For me , yes . " " Well , then , come this way to your cold bed , " he said , and held the door for me . I2711The boy was born on the eve of Christmas , an hour before midnight . Just before the birth I and the two nobles appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Gandarattended with Marcia and other women of the Queen 's household . One of these was a girl called Branwen who had lately been brought to bed of a dead child ; she was to be the child 's wet-nurse . When all was done , the baby washed and swaddled , and the Queen sleeping , I took my leave and rode out of the castle and along the track towards Dimilioc . As soon as the lights of the gate-house were out of view I turned my horse aside down the steep path into the valley which runs from the high fields above the headland down to the shore . The castle at Tintagel is built on a promontory of rock , or near-island , a crag jutting up out of the fearsome seas , which is joined to the cliffs of the mainland only by a narrow causeway . To either side of this causeway the cliffs drop away sheer to small bays of rock and shingle tucked in under the cliff . From one of these a path , narrow and precarious , and passable only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cliff to a small gate let into the roots of the castle wall . This is the postern , the secret entrance to the castle . Inside is a narrow stairway of stone leading up to the private door of the royal apartments . Halfway up the steep stairway was a broad landing , and a guard-room . Here I was to wait , until the child was judged128fit to be taken abroad into the winter 's cold . There were no guards : months past , the King had had the postern sealed , and the guard-room 's other door , giving on the main part of the castle , had been built up . For tonight the postern gate had been opened , but no porter manned it ; only Ulfin the King 's man , and Valerius , his friend and trusted officer , waited there to let me in . Valerius took me up to the guardroom , while Ulfin went out down the path into the bay to take my horse . Ralf was not with me . He had gone to ensure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was also to bring horses and to keep watch each night in the bay below the secret path . I waited for two days and nights . There was a pallet in the guard-room , and Ulfin himself had kindled a fire to banish the disused chill of the place , and from time to time brought food and fuel , and the news from above stairs . He would have waited on me if I had let him ; he was grateful still for some kindness I had shown to him in the past , and I think the King 's disfavour had distressed him . But I sent him back to his post at the Queen 's door , and spent the waiting time alone . At the other side of the landing , in the outer wall of the castle and opposite the guard-room door , was another door leading out onto a narrow , level platform skirted waist-high by a battlement . It was not overlooked by any of the castle windows , and below it , between the castle wall and the sea , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheer cliffs . In summer the place was alive with nesting sea birds , but now , in midwinter , it was barren and crisp with frost . From below , incessantly , came the suck and hush and thud of the winter sea . Each day , at dawn and sunset , I walked out to this platform to see if the weather had changed . But for three days there was no change . The air was cold , and below me the grass , 129grey with rime , was barely distinguishable in the thick mist that held the whole place shrouded , from the invisible sea below the invisible cliffs to the pale blur where the winter sun fought to clear the sky . Below the blanket of mist the sea was quiet , as quiet as it ever is on that raging coast . And every midnight , before I slept , I went out into the icy dark and looked upwards for the stars . But there was only the blank pall of the mist . Then on the third night , the wind came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the battlements and in under the doors and set the flames fluttering blue round the birch logs . I stood up , listening . I had a hand to the latch of the door when I heard a sound , in the quiet , from the head of the stairway . The door to the Queen 's apartments had opened and shut again , gently . I opened the door and looked upwards . Someone was coming softly down the stairs ; a woman , shrouded in a mantle , carrying something . I stepped out onto the landing , and the light from the guard-room door came after me , firelight and shadow . It was Marcia . I saw the tears glisten on her cheeks as she bent her head over what lay in her arms . A child , wrapped warm against the winter night . She saw me and held her burden out to me . " Take care of him , " she said . " Take care of him , as God loves him and you . " I took the child from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth of gold . " And the token ? " I asked . She handed me a ring . It was one I had often seen on Uther 's hand , made of gold , enclosing a stone of red jasper with a dragon crest carved small . I slipped it on my own finger , and saw her instinctive movement of protest , stilled as she rememberedwho I was . I smiled . " For safekeeping only . I shall put it away for him . " " My lord prince . . . " She bent her head . Then she threw130a quick glance over her shoulder to where the girl Branwen , hooded and cloaked , was coming down the stairway , with Ulfin behind her carrying a pack with her effects . Marcia turned back to me swiftly and laid a hand on my arm . " You will tell me where you are taking him ? " It was a plea , whispered . I shook my head . " I 'm sorry . It 's better that no one should know . " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Very well . But you promise me that he will be safe ? I 'm not asking you as a man , or even as a prince . I 'm asking you from your power . He will be safe ? " So Ygraine had said nothing , even to Marcia . Marcia 's guess at the future was still only a guess . But in the days to come both these women would feel the bitter need for each other 's confidence . It would be cruel to leave the Queen isolated with her knowledge and her hopes . It is not true that women can not keep secrets . Where they love , they can be trusted to death and beyond , against all sense and reason . It is their weakness , and their great strength . I met Marcia 's eyes full for a moment . " He will be King , " I said . " The Queen knows it . But for the child 's sake , you will tell no one else . " She bent her head again , without replying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward gently and drew back a fold of the shawl from the child 's face . The baby was sleeping . The eyelids , curiously full , lay over the shut eyes like pale shells . There was a thick down of dark hair on his head . Marcia stooped and kissed him lightly on the head . He slept on , undisturbed . She pulled the fold of wool back to shelter him , then with gentle expert hands settled the bundle closer into my arms . " So . Hold his head so . You will be careful going down the path ? " " I will be careful . " 131 She opened her mouth to speak again , then shook her head quickly , and I saw a tear slide from her cheek to fall on the child 's shawl . Then she turned abruptly away , and started back up the stairs . I carried the baby down the secret path . Valerius went ahead , with his sword drawn and ready , and behind me , with Ulfin 's arm to help her , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grating pebbles , Ralf 's shadow detached itself from the immense darkness of the cliffs , and we heard his quick , relieved greeting , and the tread of hoofs on the shingle . He had brought a mule for the girl , tough and sure-footed . He settled her in the saddle , then I handed the baby up to her , and she folded him close in the warmth of her cloak . Ralf vaulted to the back of his own horse and took the mule 's rein in hand . I was to lead the pack-mule . This time I planned to travel as an itinerant singer  --  a harper is free of kings ' courts where a drug-peddler is not  --  and my harp was strapped to the mule 's saddle . Ulfin gave me the lead-rein , then held my gelding for me ; it was fresh , and anxious to be moving and warm itself . I said my thanks and farewells , then he and Valerius started back up the cliff path . They would seal the postern again behind them . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the girl had already put their mounts to the bank . I saw the dim shapes pause above me , waiting , and the pale oval of Ralf 's face as he turned back to watch me . Then his arm went out , pointing . " Look ! " I turned . The mist was lifting , drawing back from a sparkling sky . Faintly , high over the castle promontory , grew a hazy moon of light . Then the last cloud blew clear , billowing before the west wind like a sail blowing towards Brittany , and in its wake , blazing through the sparkle of the lesser stars , grew the great star that had lit the night of Ambrosius ' death , and now burned steady in the east for the birth of the ChristmasKing . ' We set spurs to our horses and rode for the ship. 132 13312The wind stayed fair for Brittany , and we came in sight of the Wild Coast at dawn on the fifth day . Here the sea is never quiet ; the cliffs , high and dangerous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth of the sea gnawing white at the base ; but once round Vindanis Point the seas flattened and ran calmer , and I was even able to leave my cabin in time to watch our arrival at the wharf south of Kerrec which my father and King Budec had built years back when the invasion force was being assembled here . The morning was still , with a touch of frost and a thin mist pearling the fields . The country hereabouts is flat , field and moorland stretching inland where the wind scours the grass with salt , and for miles nothing grows but pine and wind-bitten thorn . Thin streams wind between steep mudbanksdown to the bays and inlets that bite everywhere into the coast , and at low tide the flats teem with shellfish and are loud with the cries of wading birds . For all its dour seeming it is a rich country , and had provided a haven not only for Ambrosius and Uther when Vortigern murdered their brother the King , but for hundreds of other exiles who fled from Vortigern and the threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the country already peopled by the Celts of Britain . When the Emperor Maximus , a century before , had marched on Rome , those British troops who survived his defeat had straggled back to the refuge of this friendly land . Some had gone home , but a great many had remained to marry and settle ; my kinsman , King Hoel , came of one such family . The British had indeed settled in such134111numbers that men called the peninsula Britain also , dubbing it Less Britain , as their homeland was known as Greater Britain . The language spoken here was still recognizably the same as that of home , and men worshipped the same gods , but the memories of older gods still visibly held the land , and the place was strange . I saw Branwen gazing out over the ship 's rail with wide eyes and wondering face , and even Ralf , who had travelled here before as my messenger , had a look of awe as we drew nearer the wharf and saw , beyond the huts and the piles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones . These line the fields of Less Britain , rank on rank , like old grey warriors waiting , or armies of the dead . They have stood there , men say , since time began . No one knows why , or how they came there . But I had long known that they were raised , not by giants or gods or even enchanters , but by human engineers whose skill lives on only in song . These skills I learned , when as a boy I lived in Brittany , and men called it magic . For all I know they may be right . One thing is certain , though men 's hands lifted the stones , and are long since dust under their roots , the gods they served still walk there . When I have gone between the stones at night , I have felt eyes on my back . But now the sun was up , gilding the granite surfaces , and throwing the shadows of the stones slanting blue across the frost . The wharf-side was already busy ; carts stood ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of tying up and unloading the ship . We were the only passengers , but no one cast more than a glance at the travellers in their decent , sober clothes ; the musician with the harp in his baggage and his wife and baby beside him , with his servantin attendance . Ralf had lifted the baby from Branwen 's arms , and supported her as she trod gingerly down the gangplank . She was silent and pale , and leaned heavily on him . I saw , as he bent over her , how  --  suddenly , it seemed  --  he had135grown from boy to man . He would be turned sixteen now , and though Branwen was perhaps a year older than he , Ralf might well be taken for her husband , rather than I. He looked brisk and bright , sleek as a springtime cockerel in his neat new clothes . He was the only one of our party , I thought sourly , feeling the wharf tilt and sway under me as if it had still been the heaving deck , who had weathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for us . Not the escort of troops which King Hoel had wanted to provide , but simply a mule litter for Branwen and the child , with a muleteerand one other man , who had brought horses for Ralf and myself . This man came forward now to greet me . From his bearing I judged him to be an officer , but he was not in uniform , and there was nothing to show that the escort came from the King . Nor apparently had the officer been told anything about us , beyond the fact that we were to be led into town and housed there until the King should send for us . He greeted me civilly , but without the courtesies of rank . " You are welcome , sir . The King sends his greetings , and I am here to escort you into town . I trust you had a good voyage ? " " They tell me so , " I said , " but neither I nor the lady are inclined to believe them . " He grinned . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she feels . I 'm not a great one for the sea , myself . And you , sir ? Can you ride as far as the town ? It 's little more than a mile . " " I can try , " I said . We exchanged courtesies while Ralf helped Branwen into the litter and drew the curtains against the morning chill . As she settled herself into the warmth the baby woke and began to cry . He had very good lungs , had Arthur . I suppose I must have winced . I saw a gleam of amusement in the officer 's face , and said dryly : 136 " Are you married ? " " Yes , indeed . " " I used to think sometimes what I might be missing . Now I begin to know . " He laughed at that . " One can always escape . It 's the best reason I know for being a soldier . Will you mount , sir ? " He and I rode side by side on the way into the town . Kerrec was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walled and moated , clustered round a central hill where the King 's stronghold lay . Near the ramp which led up to the castle gate was the house where my father had lived during his years of exile , while he and King Budec assembled and trained the army which had invaded Britain to claim it back for him , her rightful King . And now , perhaps , her next and greater King was here at my side , still yelling lustily , muffled in a litter , and being carried over the wooden bridge that spanned the moat , and in through the gate of the town . My companion was silent beside me . Behind us the others rode at ease ; they chatted among themselves , the sound of their voices and the sharp clop of the horses ' hoofs on the cobbles and the jingling of bits sounding loud in the still and misty daybreak . The town was just waking . Cocks crowed from yards and middens ; here and there doors were opened and women , shawled against the cold , could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day 's work . I was glad of my companion 's silence as I looked about me . Even in the five years since I had left it the place seemed to have changed completely . I suppose one can not pull a standingarmy out of a town where it has been built and trained for years , and not leave an echoing shell . The army , indeed , had been mainly quartered outside the walls , and the camps had long since been dismantled and gone back to grassland . But in the town , though King Budec 's own troops remained , 137the orderly bustle and the air of purpose and expectancy which had characterized the place in my father 's time had gone . In the street of the engineers , where I had served my apprenticeship with Tremorinus , there were a few workshopsopen and already clanging in the early dawn , but the air of high purpose had gone with the crowd and the clamour , and something almost like desolation had taken its place . I was glad that the way to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lodged with a decent couple , who made us welcome ; Branwen and the baby were carried straight off to some women 's fastness , while I was shown to a good room where a fire blazed and breakfast was spread waiting beside it . A servant carried the baggage in , and would have stayed to wait on me , but Ralf dismissed him and served the meal himself . I bade him eat with me , and he did so , cheerful and brisk as if the last week or so had been spent holidaying , and when we had done asked if I wanted to go out to explore the town . I gave him leave , but said that I would stay within doors . I am a strong man , and do not readily tire , but it takes more than a mile on dry land and a good breakfast to dispel the grinding sickness and exhaustion of a winter voyage . So I bade Ralf merely see to it that Branwen and the child were comfortable , and , after he had gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summons . It came at lamplighting , and Ralf with it , wide-eyed , witha robe over his arm of soft combed wool dyed a rich darkblue , with a border worked in gold and silver thread . " The King sent this for you . Will you wear it ? " " Certainly . It would be an insult to do anything else . " " But it 's a prince 's robe . People will wonder who you are . " " Not a prince 's , no . A singer 's robe of honour . This is acivilized country , Ralf , like my own . It 's not only princesand soldiers who are held in high esteem . When will KingHoel receive me ? " 138 " In an hour 's time , he says . He will receive you alone , before you sing in the hall . What are you laughing at ? " " King Hoel being cunning from necessity . There 's only one catch about going as a singer to Hoel 's court ; he happens to be tone deaf . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get his news . So he receives me alone . Then if the barons in his hall want to hear me , he does n't have to sit through it . " " He sent that harp along , though . " Ralf nodded to the instrument which stood shrouded near the lamp . " He sent it , yes , but it was never his ; it 's my own . " He looked at me in surprise . I had spoken more curtly than I had meant to . All day the silent harp had stood there , untouched , but speaking to me of memories , of most , indeed , that I had ever had of happiness . As a boy here in Kerrec , in my father 's house , I had played it almost nightly . I added : " It was one I used here , years ago . Hoel 's father must have kept it for me . I do n't suppose it 's been touched since I last played it . I 'd better try it before I go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door then heralded a slave with a ewer of steaming water . While I washed , and combed my hair , then let the slave help me into the sumptuous blue robe , Ralf uncoveredthe harp and set it ready . It was bigger than the one I had brought with me . That was a knee harp , easy to transport ; this was a standing harp , with a greater range and a tone which would reach the corners of a King 's hall . I tuned it carefully , then ran my fingers over the strings . To remember love after long sleep ; to turn again to poetry after a year in the market place , or to youth after resignation to drowsy and stiffening age ; to remember what once you thought life could hold , after telling over with muddied and calculating fingers what it has offered ; this is music , made after long silence . The soul flexes its wings , and , clumsy as any fledgling , tries the air again . I felt my way , groping back139through the chords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exploring , testing as a man tests in the dark ground which once he knew in daylight . Whispers , small jags of sound , bunches of notes dragged sharply . The wires thrilled , catching the firelight , and the long running chords lapsed into the song . There was a hunter at the moon 's dark Who sought to lay a net of gold in the marshes . A net of gold , a net heavy as gold . And the tide came in and drowned the net , Held it invisible , deep , and the hunter waited , Crouching by the water in the moon 's dark . They came , the birds ( lighting the dark , Hundred on hundred , a king 's army . They landed on the water , a fleet of ships , Of king 's ships , proud with silver , silver masted , Swift ships , fierce in battle , Crowding the water in the moon 's dark . The net was heavy beneath them , hidden , waiting to catch them . But he lay still , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your net . Your children will eat tonight , And your wife will praise you , the cunning hunter . He drew in his net , the young hunter , drew it tight and fast . It was heavy , and he drew it to shore , among the reeds . It was heavy as gold , but nothing was there but water . There was nothing in it but water , heavy as gold , And one grey feather , From the wing of a wild goose . They had gone , the ships , the armies , into the moon 's dark . And the hunter 's children were hungry , and his wife lamented . But he slept dreaming , holding the wild goose feather . King Hoel was a big , thick-bodied man in his middle thirties . During the time I had spent in Kerrec  --  from my twelfth to my seventeenth year  --  I had seen very little of him . He had been a lusty and dedicated fighting man , while I was only a youth , and busy with my studies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father 's troops in Greater Britain , and there we had come to know and to like one another . He was a man of big appetites and , as such men often are , good natured and tending to laziness . Since I had last seen him he had put on flesh , and his face had the flush of good living , but I had no doubt he would be as stalwart as ever in the field . I started by speaking of his father King Budec and the changes that had come , and we talked for a while of past times . " Ah , yes , those were good years . " He stared , chin on fist , into the fire . He had received me in his private chamber , and after we had been served with wine , had dismissed the servants . His two deer-hounds lay stretched on the skins at his feet , dreaming still of the chase they had had that day . His hunting spears , freshly cleaned , stood against the wall behind his chair , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , and spoke wistfully . " I wonder , when will such years come again ? " " You are talking of the fighting years ? " " I am talking of Ambrosius ' years , Merlin . " " They will come again , with your help now . " He looked140 141puzzled , then startled , and uneasy . I had spoken prosaically enough , but he had caught the implications . Like Uther , he was a man who liked everything normal , open and ordinary . " You mean the child ? The bastard ? After all we 've heard about it , he 'll be the one to succeed Uther ? " " Yes . I promise you . " He fidgeted with his cup , and his eyes slid away from mine . " Ah , yes . Well , we shall keep him safely . But tell me , why the secrecy ? I had a letter from Uther asking me openly enough to care for the boy . Ralf could n't tell me much more than was in the letters he brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can , but I do n't want a quarrel with Uther . His letter to me made it pretty clear that this boy 's only his heir in default of a better claim . " " That 's true . Do n't be afraid , I do n't want a quarrel , either , between you and Uther . One does n't throw a precious morsel down between two fighting-dogs and expect it to survive . Until there is a boy with what Uther calls a better claim , he 's as anxious as I am to keep this one safe . He knows what I 'm doing , up to a point . " " Ah . " He cocked an eye at me , intrigued . I had been right about him . He might be well disposed towards Britain , but he was not above doing a quietly back-handed turn to Britain 's King . " Up to what point ? " " The time when the baby is weaned , and grown enough to need men 's company and to be taught men 's arts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall take him back from you , and he must go home to Britain . If Uther asks where he is , he will have to be told , but until he does  --  well , there 's no need to seek him out , is there ? Myself , I doubt if Uther will question you at all . I think he would forget this child if he could . In any case , if there is blame , it is mine . He put the boy in my charge , to rear as I thought fit . " " But will it be safe to take him back ? If Uther 's sending him here now because of enemies at home , are you sure it will be better then ? " " It 's a risk that will have to be taken . I want to be near the child as he grows . It should be in Britain , and therefore it must be in secret . There are bad times coming , Hoel , for us all . I can not yet see what will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this bastard if you like  --  will have enemies , even more than Uther has . You call him bastard ; so will other men with ambition . His secret enemies will be more deadly even than the Saxons . So he must be hidden until the time comes for him to take the crown , and then he must take it with no cast of doubt , and be raised King in the sight of all Britain . " " He must be ? ' You have seen things , then ? " But before I could answer he shied quickly away from the strange ground , and cleared his throat . " Well , I 'll keep him safe for you , as well as I may . Just tell me what you want . You know your own business , always did . I 'll trust you to keep me right with Uther . " He gave his great laugh . " I remember how Ambrosius used to say that your judgment in matters of policy , even when you were a youngling , was worth ten of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had said no such thing , and in any case would hardly have said it to Hoel , who had a fair reputation himself as a lover , but I took it as it was intended , and thanked him . He went on : " Well , tell me what you want . I confess I 'm puzzled . . . . These enemies you talk of , wo n't they guess he 's in Brittany ? You say Uther made no secret of his plans , and when the time comes for the royal ship to sail and it 's seen that you and the child are n't on it , wo n't they simply think he was sent over earlier , and search first for him here in Brittany ? " " Probably . But by that time he 'll be disposed of in the143place I 've arranged for him , and that 's not the kind of place where Uther 's nobles would think of looking . And I myself will be gone . " " What place is that ? Am I to know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near your boundary , north , towards Lanascol . " " What ? " He was startled , and showed it . One of the hounds stirred and opened an eye . " North ? At the edge of Gorlan 's land ? Gorlan is no friend to the Dragon . " " Nor to me , " I said . " He 's a proud man , and there is an old score between his house and my mother 's . But he has no quarrel with you ? " " No , indeed , " said Hoel fervently , with the respect of one fighting man for another . " So I believed . So Gorlan is n't likely to make forays into the edge of your territory . What 's more , who would dream that I would hide the child so near him ? That with all Brittanyto choose from , I 'd leave him within bowshot of Uther 's enemy ? No , he 'll be safe . When I leave him , I 'll do so with a quiet mind . But that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I smiled at him . " Even the stars need help at times . " " I 'm glad to hear it , " said Hoel gruffly . " We mere kings like to think we have our parts to play . But you and your stars might make it a bit easier for us , perhaps ? Surely , in all that great forest north of here , there must be safer places than the very edge of my lands ? " " Possibly , but it happens that I have a safe house there . The one person in both the Britains who 'll know exactly what to do with the child for the next four years , and will care for him as she would for her own . " " She ? " " Yes . My own nurse , Moravik . She 's a Breton born , and after Maridunum was sacked in Camlach 's war she left South Wales and went home . Her father owned a tavern north of144here at a place called Coll . Since he 'd grown too old for work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brand 's wife was dead , and soon after Moravik returned home she and Brand married , just to keep things right in the sight of God . . . and , knowing Moravik , I 'm not just talking about the inn 's title deeds They keep the place still . You must have passed it , though I doubt if you 'd ever stop there  --  it stands where two streams join and a bridge crosses them . Brand 's a retired soldier of your own , and a good man  --  and in any case will do as Moravik bids him . " I smiled . " I never knew a man who did n't , except perhaps my grandfather . " " Ye  --  es . " He still sounded doubtful . " I know the village , a handful of huts by the bridge , that 's all . . . . As you say , hardly a likely place to hunt a High King 's heir . But an inn ? Is n't that in itself a risk ? With men  --  Gorlan 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming and going from the road ? " " So , no one will question your messengers or mine . My man Ralf will stay there to guard the boy , and he 'll need to stay abreast of news , and get messages to you from time to time , and to me . " " Yes . Yes , I see . And when you take the child there , what 's your story ? " " No one will think twice about a travelling harper plying his trade on a journey . And Moravik has put a story round that will explain the sudden appearance of Ralf and the baby and his nurse . The story , if anyone questions it , will be that the girl , Branwen , is Moravik 's niece , who bore a child to her master over in Britain . Her mistress cast her from the house , and she had no other place to go , but the man gave her money for the passage to her aunt 's house in Brittany , and paid the travelling singer and his man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanwhile , will decide to leave his master and stay with the girl . " " And the singer himself ? How long will you stay there ? " 145 " Only as long as a travelling singer might , then I 'll move on and be forgotten . By the time anyone even thinks to look farther for Uther 's child , how can they find him ? No one knows the girl , and the baby is only a baby . Every house in the country has one or more to show . " He nodded , chewing it over this way and that , and asked a few more questions . Finally he admitted : " It will serve , I suppose . What do you want me to do ? " " You have watchers in the kingdoms that march with yours ? " He laughed shortly . " Spies ? Who has n't ? " " Then you 'll hear quickly enough if there 's any hint of trouble from Gorlan or anyone else . And if you can arrange for some quick and secret contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Easy . Trust me . Anything I can do , short of war with Gorlan . . . " He gave his deep chuckle again . " Eh , Merlin , it 's good to see you . How long can you stay ? " " I 'll take the boy north tomorrow , and with your permissionwill go unescorted . I 'll come back as soon as I see all is safe . But I 'll not come here again . You might be expected to receive a travelling singer once , but not actually to encourage him . " " No , by God ! " I grinned . " If this weather holds , Hoel , could the ship stay for me for a few days ? " " For as long as you like . Where do you plan to go ? " " Massilia first , then overland to Rome . After that , eastwards . " He looked surprised . " You ? Well , here 's a start ! I 'd always thought of you being as fixed as your own misty hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . Where do ideas come from ? I have to lose myself for a few years , till the child needs me , and this seemed to be the way . Besides , there was something I heard . " I did not tell him that it had only been the wind in the bowstrings . " I 've had a mind lately to see some of the lands I learned about as a boy . " We talked on then for a while . I promised to send letters back with news from the eastern capitals , and , as far as I could , I gave him points of call to which he would send his own tidings and Ralf 's about Arthur . The fire died down and he roared for a servant . When the man had been and gone " You 'll have to go and sing in the hall soon , " said Hoel . " So if we 've got all clear , we 'll leave it at that , shall we ? " He leaned back in his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed against his knee , asking for a caress . Over the sleek head the King 's eyes gleamed with amusement . " Well now , you 've still to give me the news from Britain . And the first thing you can do is to-tell me the inside story of what happened nine months ago . " " If you in your turn will tell me what the public story is . " He laughed . " Oh , the usual stories that follow you as closely as your cloak flapping in the wind . Enchantments , flying dragons , men carried through the air and through walls , invisibly . I 'm surprised , Merlin , that you take the trouble to come by ship like an ordinary man , when your stomach serves you so ill . Come now , the story . " It was very late when I got back to our lodging . Ralf was waiting , half asleep in the chair by the fire in my room . He jumped up when he saw me , and took the harp from me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north in the morning . No , thank you , no wine . I drank with the King , and they made me drink again in the hall . " " Let me take your cloak . You look tired . Did you have to sing to them ? " " Certainly . " I held out a handful of silver and gold pieces , 146 147and a jewelled pin . " It 's nice to think , is n't it , that one can earn one 's keep so handsomely ? The jewel was from the King , a bribe to stop me singing , otherwise they 'd have had me there yet . I told you this was a cultured country . Yes , cover the big harp . I 'll take the other with me tomorrow . " Then as he obeyed me : " What of Branwen and the baby ? " " Went to bed three hours since . She 's lying with the women . They seem very pleased to have a baby to look after . " He finished on a note of surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Not for an hour or two . They did n't seem to mind that , either . " " Well , no doubt he 'll start again at cock-crow , when we rouse them . Now go to bed and sleep while you can . We start at first light . " 14813There is a road leading almost due north out of the town of Kerrec , the old Roman road which runs straight as a spearcastacross the bare , salty grassland . A mile out of town , beyond the ruined posting station , you can see the forest ahead of you like a slow tidal wave approaching to swallow the salt flats . This is a vast stretch of woodland , deep and wild . The road spears straight into it , aiming for the big river that cuts the country from east to west . When the Romans held Gallia there was a fort and settlement beyond the river , and the road was built to serve it ; but now the river marks the boundary of Hoel 's kingdom , and the fort is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king runs far into the forest , which stretches for countless hilly miles , covering the rugged center of the Breton peninsula . What traffic there is keeps to the road ; the wild land is served only by the tracks of charcoal-burners and wood-cutters and men who move secretly outside the law . At the time of which I write the place was called the Perilous Forest , and was reputed to be magic-bound and haunted . Once leave the road and plunge into the tracks that twist through the tangled trees , and you could travel for days and hardly see the sun . When my father had held command in Brittany under King Budec , his troops had kept order even in the forest , as far as the river where King Budec 's land ended and King Gorlan 's began . They had cut the trees well back to either side of the road , and opened up some of the subsidiary tracks , but this had been neglected , and now the saplings and the bushes had149 crowded in . The paved surface of the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there it crumbled off into patches of iron-hard mud that in soft weather would be a morass . We set out on a grey , cold day , with the wind tasting faintly of salt . But though the wind blew damp from the sea it brought no rain with it , and the going was fair enough . The huge trees stood on either hand like pillars of metal , holding a weight of low , grey sky . We rode in silence , and after a few miles the thickly encroaching growth of the underwood forced us , even on this road , to ride in single file . I was in the lead , with Branwen behind me , and Ralf in the rear leading the pack-mule . I had been conscious for the first hour or so of Ralf 's tension , the way his head turned from side to side as he watched and listened ; but we saw and heard nothing except the quiet winter life of the forest ; a fox , a pair of roe deer , and once a shadowy shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . Nothing else ; no sound of horses , no sign of men . Branwen showed no hint of fear . When I glanced back I saw her always serene , sitting the neat-footed mule stolidly , with an unmoved calm that held no trace of uneasiness . I have said little about Branwen , because I have to confess that I remember very little about her . Thinking back now over the span of years , I see only a brown head bent over the baby she carried , a rounded cheek and downcast eyes and a shy voice . She was a quiet girl who  --  though she talked easily enough to Ralf  --  rarely addressed me of her own will , being painfully in awe of me both as prince and enchanter . She seemed to have no inkling of any risk or danger in our journey , nor did she seem stirred  --  as most girls would have been  --  by the excitement of travelling abroad to a new coun- try . Her imperturbable calm was not due to confidence in myself or Ralf ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point of stupidity , and her devotion to the baby was such as to blind her to all else . She was the kind of woman whose only life is in the bearing and rearing of children , and without Arthur she would , I am sure , have suffered bitterly over the loss of her own baby . As it was , she seemed to have forgotten this , and spent the hours in a kind of dreamy contentment that was exactly what Arthur needed to make the discomforts of the journey tolerable . Towards noon we were deep in the forest . The branches laced thick overhead , and in summer would have shut out the sky like a pitched shield , but above the bare boughs of winter we could see a pale and shrouded point of light where the sun struggled to be through . I watched for a sheltered place where we could leave the road without showing too many traces , and presently , just as the baby woke and began to fret , saw a break in the undergrowth and turned my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding , but in the sparse growth of winter it was passable . It led into the forest for a hundred paces or so before it divided , one path leading on deeper among the trees , the other  --  no more than a deer-trod  --  winding steeply up to skirt the base of a rocky spur . We followed the deer-trod . This picked its way through fallen boulders tufted with dead and rusty fern , then led upwards round a stand of pines , and faded into the bleached grass of a tiny clearing above the rock . Here , in a hollow , the sun came with a faint warmth . We dismounted , and I spread a saddle-cloth in the most sheltered spot for the girl , while Ralf tethered the horses below the pines and threw down feed from the hay nets . Then we sat ourselves down to eat . I sat at the lip of the hollow , with my back against a tree , a post from which I could see the main path running below the rock . Ralf stayed with Branwen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken our fast , and we were all hungry . TheI5 ' baby , indeed , had begun to yell lustily as the mule scrambled up the steep path . Now he found his cries stifled against the girl 's nipple , and fell silent , sucking busily . The forest was very quiet . Most wild creatures lie still at noon . The only thing moving was a carrion crow , which flapped heavily down onto a pine above us , and began to caw . The horses finished their feed and dozed , hip-shotten , heads low . The baby still fed , but more slowly , drowsing into milky sleep . I leaned back against the stem of the tree . I could hear Branwen murmuring to Ralf . He said something , and I heard her laugh , then through the murmur of the two young voices I caught another , distant , sound . Horses , at the trot . At my word the boy and girl fell abruptly silent . Ralf was on his feet in the blink of an eye , and kneeling beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay where she was . I need not have troubled ; she had turned a wonderinglook on us , then the baby hiccupped , and she held him to her shoulder , patting him , all her attention on him again . Ralf and I knelt at the edge of the clearing , watching the path below . The horses  --  there were two of them by the sound of it  --  could not be wood-cutters ' beasts nor the slow train of the charcoal-burners . Trotting horses , in the Perilous Forest , meant only one thing , trouble . And travellers who carried , as we did , gold for the baby 's keep were quarry for any outlaws and disaffected men . Hampered as we were by Branwen and Arthur , both fighting and flight were impossible . Nor was it easy , with the baby , to keep silent and let danger pass by so closely . I had made it clear to Ralf that whatever happened he was to stay with the girl and , at the least hint of danger , leave it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ralf had protested , mutinied , then finally seen the sense of it and sworn to obey. 152So now when I whispered , " Only two , I think . If they do n't come up this way , they 'll not see us . Get to the horses . And for God 's sake tell the girl to keep the baby quiet , " he merely nodded , melting back from my side . He stooped to whisper to Branwen , and I saw her nod placidly , shifting the child to her other breast . Ralf slipped like a shadow among the pines where the horses stood . I waited , watching the path . The riders were approaching . There was no other sound except the crow , still cawing high in the pine tree . Then I saw them . Two horses , trotting single file ; poor beasts , heavy bred and none too well fed by the look of them , careless how they put their feet , and having to be hauled up by their cursing riders at every hole or root across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men were outlaws . They were as unkempt as their beasts , and looked half savage , and dangerous . They were dressed in what looked like old uniforms , and on the arm of one of them was a dirty badge , half torn away . It looked like Gorlan 's . The fellow in the rear rode carelessly , lolling in the saddle as if half drunken , but the man in front pricked at the alert , as such men learn to do , his head moving from side to side like that of a questing dog . He held a bow at the ready . Through the rotten leather of the sheath at his thigh I saw the long knife , burnished to a killing point . They were almost below me . They were passing . There had been no sound from the baby , nor from our horses , hidden among the pines . Only the carrion crow , balancing high in the sunshine , scolded noisily . I saw the fellow with the bow lift his head . He said somethingover his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He grinned , showing a row of rotten teeth , then lifted his bow , notched it , and sent an arrow whizzing into the pine . It hit . The crow shot upwards off the bough with a yell , then153fell , transfixed . It landed within two paces of Branwen and the child , flapped for a second or two , then lay still . As I dodged back and ran for the pines I heard both men laughing . Now the marksman would come to retrieve his arrow . Already I could hear him forcing his beast through the underbrush . I picked up the arrow , crow and all , and flung it out over the edge of the hollow . It landed down among the boulders . From the path the man could not have seen where the bird fell ; it was a chance that he might be- lieve it had fluttered there , and would ride no farther . I saw Branwen 's eyes , startled and wondering , as I ran past her . But she did not stir , and the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was meant to convey reassurance , approval , and warning all in one , and ran for my horse . Ralf was holding the beasts quiet , heads together , muffling eyes and nostrils with his cloak . I paused beside him , listen- ing . The outlaws were coming on . They must not have seen the crow ; they came on without pausing , making for the pines . I seized my sorrel 's bridle from Ralf , and turned it to mount . The horse circled , treading the dry stalks and snap- ping twigs . I heard the sudden clatter and tramp as the outlaws dragged their beasts to a standstill . One of them said , " Listen ! " in Breton , and there was the rasp of metal as weapons came hissing out . I was in the saddle . My own sword was out . I pulled the sorrel 's head round , and had opened my mouth to shout when I heard another cry from the path , then the same voice yelling " Look ! Look there ! " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing broke out of the bushes beside me and went by so close that it almost brushed my leg . It was a hind , white against the winter forest . She scudded through the pines like a ghost , bounded along the top of the hollow where we had lain , stood poised for a moment in viewat the edge , then vanished down the steep , boulder-strewn slope , straight into the path of the two outlaws . I heard shouts of triumph from below , the crack of a whip , the sudden thud and flurry of hoofs as the men wrenched their horses back to the path and lashed them to a gallop . They were giving hunting calls . I jumped from the saddle , threw the sorrel 's reins to Ralf , and ran back to my place above the rock . I reached it in time to see the two of them going back full tilt the way they had come . Ahead of them , dimly seen for a moment , like a scud of mist through the bare trees , fled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hammer of hard-driven horses , echoed plunging back through the forest , and was gone. 14The river which marks the boundary of Hoel 's kingdom flows right through the heart of the forest . In places it cuts a deep gorge between overhanging banks of trees , and everywherein the central part of the forest the land is seamed by small , wild valleys where tributary streams wind or tumble into the main . But there is a place , almost in the center of the forest , where the river valley is wider and more gentle , forminga green basin where men have tilled the fields , and over the years have cut back the forest to make grazing land round the small settlement called Coll , which in Breton means the Hidden Place . Here there had been , in past times , a Roman transit camp on the road from Kerrec to Lanascol . All that remained of this now was the squared outline where the original ditch had been dug beside the tributary . Here lay " the village . On two sides of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest , the Roman ditch had been cleared and widened , and filled with water . Inside this were steep defensive earthworks , crowned with palisades . The bridge had been a stone one in Roman times ; the piles still stood and were spanned now with planking . Though the village lay near Gorlan 's border , it was accessible from it only through the narrow pass cut by the river , and there the road had crumbled almost back to the original rocky path that wolves and wild men had used before the Romans ever came . Coll was well named . Brand 's tavern lay just inside the gate . The main street of the village was little more than a dirty alley floored unevenly156with cobbles . The inn stood a little way back from this , on the right . It was a low building , roughly built of stone , with mortar slapped haphazardly into the gaps . The outbuildings round the yard were no more than wattle huts , daubed with mud . The roof was newly thatched , with good close work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy stones . The door was open , as the door of an inn should be , with a heavy curtain of skins hung across the opening to keep the weather out . Through the chimney hole at one end rose a sluggish column of smoke that smelled of peat . We arrived at dusk when the gates were closing . Everywheremingled with the peat smoke came the smells of supper cooking . There were few people about ; the children had been called in long since , and the men were home at their supper . Only a few hungry-looking dogs skulked here and there ; an old woman hurried past with a shawl held over her face and a fowl squawking under her other arm ; a man led a yoke of weary oxen along the street . I could hear the clink of a smith 's anvil not far away , and smell the sharp fume of burned hoofs . Ralf eyed the inn dubiously . " It looked better in October , on a sunny day . It 's not much of a place , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No one will come looking in a place like this for the son of the King of Britain . Go in now and play your part , while I hold the horses . " He pushed aside the curtain and went in . I helped Branwen dismount , and settled her on one of the benches beside the door . The baby woke , and began to whimper , but almost immediately Ralf came out again , followed by a big , burly man and a boy . The man must be Brand himself ; he had been a fighting man and still bore himself like one , and I saw the puckered seam of an old wound across the back of one hand . He hesitated , uncertain how to greet me . I said quickly : " You 'll be the innkeeper ? I 'm Emrys the singer , who was to157bring your wife 's niece along with us , with the baby . You 're expecting us , I believe ? " He cleared his throat . " Indeed , indeed . You 're most welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . " He saw the boy staring , and added sharply : " What are you waiting for ? Take the horses round the back . " The boy darted to obey . Brand , ducking his head at me and indicating the door of the inn with a gesture that was half invitation , half salute , said : " Come in , come in . Supper 's cooking . " Then , doubtfully , " It 's mighty rough company we get here , but maybe  --  " " I 'm used to rough company , " I said tranquilly , and preceded him through the door . This was not a time of year for much coming and going on the roads , so the place was not crowded . There were some half-dozen men , dimly seen in a room lit only by one tallow candle and the light from the peat fire . The talk hushed as we went in , and I saw the looks at the harp I carried , and the whisper that went round . Nobody spared a glance for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too quickly : " On through there . That far door , behind the fire . " Then the door shut behind us , and there in the back room stood Moravik , fists on her hips , waiting to greet us . Like everyone else whom one has not seen since childhood , she had shrunk . When I had last seen her I had been a boy of twelve , and tall for my age . Even then she had seemed much bigger than I was , a creature of bulk and commanding voice , surrounded by the aura of authority and infallible decisions left over from the nursery . Now she came no higher than my collar-bone , but she still had the bulk and the voice , and  --  I was to find  --  the authority . Though I had turned out to be the favoured son of the High King of all Britain , I was still , obviously , the wayward small boy from her first nursery. 158Her first words were characteristic . " And a fine time of night to come , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that forest all night , and a precious lot there 'd have been left of you by morning , what with the wolves , and worse , that lives out there . And damp , too , I should n't wonder  --  sweet saints and stars preserve us , look at your cloak ! Get it off this minute , and come to the fire . There 's a good supper cooking , special for you . I remember all the things you like , and I never thought to see you sitting at my table again , young Merlin , not after that night when the place burned down round you , and there was nothing to be found of you in the morning but a few burned bones in your room . " Then suddenly she came forward with a rush and had hold of me . There were tears on her face . " Eh , Merlin , little Merlin , but it 's good to see you again . " " And you , Moravik . " I embraced her . " I swear you must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now you 're putting me in your debt again , you and your good man here . I 'll not forget it , and neither will the King . Now , this is Ralf , my companion , and this "  --  drawing the girl forward  --  " is Branwen , with the child . " " Eh , the baby ! The good Goddess save us all ! What with seeing you , Merlin , I 'd forgotten all about him ! Come near the fire , girl , do n't stand there in the draught . Come to the fire , and let me see him . . . Eh , the lamb , the bonny lamb . . . . " Brand touched my arm , grinning . " And now , what with seeing him , she 'll forget everything else , my lord . It 's lucky she got the supper ready for you before she got a sight of the baby . Sit you down here . I 'll serve you myself . " Moravik had made a rich mutton stew , satisfying and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good even as anything we get in Wales . There were dumplings with the stew , and good new bread hot from the oven . Brand brought **26;279;TOOLONG Beauty 40 " I doubt it . I thought of trying her uncle 's place in Bel-Air . What 's his name  --  Somerville ? " " Captain Benjamin Somerville . He 's a retired Navy captain who married her father 's sister . His phone number is unlisted , but I can give you his address . " She copied it out of an address book and followed me to the door . " Have you known Laurel long ? " " We met on the beach this afternoon . " She did n't ask me how , which was just as well . I might have had to tell her that I had followed Laurel , just as Tom Russo had followed her out of the drugstore in his white coat . VIIIThe darkness in Bel-Air was almost thick enough to lean on . I drove around in it for a while and eventually found a mailbox with " Capt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in white . There were several bullet holes in the mailbox . I went up the asphalt driveway . The house and its outbuild- ings sat on the hilltop under an unobstructed sky . I could see stars overhead , and below them the night fields of the city looking as if they had been fenced with light and seeded with more stars . There was no visible light in the large one-storied house . I knocked and waited , and after a while knocked again . The hushed sound of feet approached the other side of the door . In the overhang above me and all around the house , lights went on . The door was opened about five inches on a chain. 41Dark eyes looked out at me from a dark face . " What is it you want ? " " I 'd like to see Captain Somerville . " " There 's nobody home . " The black man 's voice was flat and toneless . " You are . " " That 's true . But I do n't know you . " And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a fairly detailed account of who I was and how I had happened to come there . He interrupted me and asked to see my license . I showed it to him through the five-inch opening . Even then he did n't let me in . He unhooked the chain and stepped outside , closing the door behind him , then testing it to see if it was locked . He had keys in his hand , and he dropped them into his pocket . His other pocket sagged with the weight of what looked like a gun . He was a big man about my age . His face was unreadable . He had on a faded blue shirt and pants which resembled a uniform . His left arm appeared to be crippled , and I noticed that the hand remained half closed . His voice was low and impersonal . " Captain Somerville 's niece has n't been here tonight . I 've been here all night , and I can guarantee it . I understand she 's staying with her grandmother in Pacific Point . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come here ? " " She used to come here often enough when she was younger . But not so much any more . " " What about Captain Somerville ? " " This is where he lives , man . He 's lived here nearly thirty years . " " I mean where is he now ? " " I 'm not supposed to say . We 've had some bad calls in the last couple of days . " " About the oil spill ? " Sleeping Beauty 42 " That was the idea . The Captain 's the executive vice-presidentof the company . Naturally he gets the blame , even if he 's clean as the driven snow . " " I noticed bullet holes in the mailbox . " " That 's right . Some people just are n't happy unless they 're shooting up other people 's property . " " Was that another protest against the oil spill ? " " They did n't stop to say . They came here on motorcycles . I think they were just trigger-happy , looking for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , then turned and gave me a long appraising look . " But you did n't come out here to talk to me about the motorbike boys . " " They interest me . When were they here ? " " Last night . They roared up the hill and fired a few rounds and roared away again . Captain Somerville was n't here at the time . Fact is , I was in the house watching him on TV when it happened . The Captain and young Mr. Lennox  --  Laurel 's father  --  were on the ten o'clock news explaining the oil spill to the people . " " How did they explain it ? " " They said it was an act of God , mainly . " There may have been some irony in his voice but I could detect no trace of it in his face . " They said that every now and then nature lets them down and all they can do is clean up after her . " " Is n't that a little rough on nature ? " " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath of the sweet-smelling night air . " I look after the Captain 's place for him and that 's about all I know . " He looked and talked like a man who knew a good deal more . " Have you worked here long , Mr.  --  ? " " Smith . My name is Smith . I 've worked for him over twenty-five years , ever since me and the Captain retired from the Navy , and before that . I was his special steward when he had his last sea duty . We were at Okinawa together . That 's where the Captainlost his ship . And where I got this . " He touched his crippled left hand with his right. 43He seemed ready to unload his war reminiscences . I warded them off : " So you 've known Laurel since she was a little girl ? " " Off and on , I guess you could say that . I knew her better when she was a little girl than I have since . After the war , her parents used to live in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And they used to drop her off here when they needed a baby-sitter . She was a sweet little thing , but also a handful sometimes . " " What did she do ? " " She used to run away , just like she did on you . Sometimes I 'd spend a couple of hours looking for her . If she 'd been doing it for fun , it would n't have been so bad . But she was n't . She used to be really scared . You 'd think I spent a lot of time beating on her . But I never raised a hand to the little tyke . I was fond of her . " His voice and eyes had softened . " What was she scared of ? " " Just about everything . She could n't stand any kind of trouble  --  anybody lifting his hand or raising his voice in anger . If a bird flew into the window glass and got killed , it used to shake her up for half a day . I remember once I threw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't aiming to hit him , just scare him off . But I hit him and he let out a yowl and Miss Laurel saw it happen . She went and hid for the rest of the afternoon . " " Where would she hide ? " " She had several places . She kept changing them on me . The room back of the garage . The pool house . The storage shed . Those were some of them . " " Show me the places , will you ? " " Tonight ? " " She may not last till morning . " He looked closely into my face . " You honestly think she could be holed up around here ? " " It 's a possibility . Sometimes when people are badly shaken they go back to childish patterns . " He nodded . " I know what you mean . I 've done it myself . " He led me around the house to the garage and unlocked theSleeping Beauty 44door . The building contained three cars  --  a middle-aged Continental , a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no space for another car . That made me wonder if Captain Somerville was n't at home after all . Laurel was n't in any of the cars , or in the toolroom or the half-bathroom behind the garage . Smith picked up a flashlight in the toolroom . We went down the hillside through trees , bumping our heads on unripe oranges . He opened the door of the storage shed . It was built of roughly finished redwood , now weathered light , and filled with the random accumulations of years : old furniture , shelves of fading books , dusty luggage covered with foreign labels , a rusted filing cabinet , garden tools and insecticidesand rat poison . No Laurel . Smith 's flashlight beam probed the dark corners for her . He let the beam rest for a moment on a wooden sea chest painted blue and stenciled in red with the Captain 's name and rank and the name of a U.S. Navy vessel , Canaan Sound . Then he raised the light to a picture that hung on the rough wall above the chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man in a captain 's hat smiled through cracked dusty glass . " That was the Captain before he lost his ship , " Smith said . He kept his light on the picture while I studied it . The Captainhad been handsome and confident , though his half-smilingmouth could hardly support the boldness of his eyes . When we went outside , I said , " Are you sure the Captainis n't home tonight ? " " What makes you think he is ? " " You 're showing me everything but the inside of the house . " " Those are my orders . Nobody is allowed in the house . " We went along a flagstone path to the pool house . The pumpinside was breathing like a marathon runner . Under that noiseI could hear the scurrying sounds of a small animal . Smith handed me the flashlight and took the gun from his pocket . It looked like a .38 with a two-inch barrel. 45 " What are you going to do with that ? " " I hear a rat in there . Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door open with his crippled hand . The pool house was full of faint moving lights from the heater . I turned the flashlight on the cement floor , fearful for an instant that Laurel might be in there and be accidentally shot . A bright-eyed rat was caught in the light . He ran for the drainage hole . Before he got there , the gun went off beside me . The rat fell in a red blur , twitched , and lay still . IXAs if the sound of Smith 's gun had been a prearranged signal , a phone began to ring somewhere uphill from us . It rang three times , and stopped . By that time , Smith was at the top of the hill and I was close behind him . We paused on the concrete pool deck at the side of the house . I could hear a man 's voice , hoarse and strained , talking inside . " The Captain 's at home , is n't he ? " I said . " That 's right . I had orders not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been disturbed , will you let me see him ? " " What about ? " " Laurel . " " She is n't here . You saw that for yourself . " " That could be Laurel on the phone now . " " I 'll ask him . " He unlocked a sliding glass door and went into the house , leaving me outside . I walked up and down on the deck , trying to lose my feeling of frustration . All I had to show for mySleeping Beauty 46evening 's work was a dead rat and a persistent vision of Laurel lying somewhere with an empty vial beside her . Inside the house , the Captain 's intermittent voice continued like a voice in a dream , just beyond the range of comprehension . Then I heard Smith 's voice . He came to the sliding glass door and opened it exactly wide enough to admit me . " The Captain says he 'll see you . Do n't keep him too long . He has n't had any real sleep for two nights . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study . He was gray and haggard . In the collapsing structures of his face I could barely recognize the younger man whose picture hung in the storage shed . There were no pictures at all on the walls of his study . He stood up and gave me a brisk handshake which failed to convey an impression of energy . " I understand you 're a private detective , Mr. Archer . It is n't clear to me who you 're working for . " " Tom Russo , your niece 's husband . " " Where is my niece ? " " I do n't know . She took off with a tube of Nembutal cap-sules  --  " His voice cut in on mine : " Where and when ? " " From my apartment in West Los Angeles , sometime before eight tonight . " " Who did she leave with ? " " She was alone . " " Are you sure ? " His eyes probed at me from his sun-scarred face . " She may have been picked up on the street , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ? " " I 'm saying it could have happened . " " Who picked her up ? " " I do n't know . I do n't know that she was picked up . " He turned and walked the short distance to the end of the room . His bare feet made no sound at all on the carpet . He47turned and came back toward me with his finger pointing at me like a prosecutor 's . " Why did you come here ? " " I 've been trying various places she might be . Her husband 's house . Her friend Joyce Hampshire 's place . I 've talked to her parents . " " How long ago ? " I looked at my watch . It was past eleven o'clock . " Within the last couple of hours . I do n't get the point of all these questions you 're asking . " " Do n't you ? " The Captain raised himself on his toes . He was the shortest man of the three of us . Smith towered over him but held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should have dissolved in history long since . " You 're being rather mysterious , Captain . " " Then I 'll be plain . Before I talk to you any further , I want the name of someone who will vouch for you . Someone known to me personally or by reputation . " " That 's a little tough at this time of night . " " This is a tough situation , " he said . " All right . Do you know John Truttwell in Pacific Point ? " " Yes . I know him slightly . I know his former associate EmersonLittle better . Little happens to be my mother-in-law 's attorney . " " Ask him about me . " The Captain sat down at his desk , made the call , and got Emerson Little at home . After a few preliminaries , he asked Little for his opinion of me . He listened to what Little had to say without any visible change in his expression . Then he thanked him and hung up . " He gives you a clean bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about . " " I hope he does . " " My niece 's life may be in danger . " Sleeping Beauty 48 " I 've been working on that assumption . " His face closed up like a fist , which he thrust at me . " Did you know that she 's been abducted ? " " No . " " She has been . Her father received a ransom demand shortly after he got home tonight . " " In writing or by phone ? " " I understand by phone . The amount is quite large  --  a good deal more than he has available . " " How much ? " " A hundred thousand dollars , in cash . Since Jack and Marian do n't have the money themselves , they appealed to his mother . It was his mother  --  Laurel 's grandmother  --  who phoned me just a few minutes ago . Jack asked her not to tell anyone , but she decided that she 'd better consult with me . I 'm the active head of the family , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage . " There was a streak of vanity in him , I noticed , which went a little strangely with his concern for his niece . His niece by marriage . I said : " How soon does the money have to be available ? " " They asked for it tonight . But of course that is n't possible , since they 're demanding cash . They 've got to give us more time . " " Are they going to call back ? " " I understand they are , sometime in the course of the night . Jack will try to put them off until tomorrow noon at least . " " Is he going to call the police ? " " I do n't think so ; they warned him not to . You understand I have n't talked to Jack . I 've only heard from my mother-in-law . Sylvia 's naturally very upset and not too coherent . " " Is she willing to provide the money ? " " Of course she is . Sylvia is extremely fond of Laurel . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There may be other problems . Before the family pays it , 49make sure that the person or persons paid actually have her . And make sure that she 's alive . " Somerville looked at me in alarm . " I ca n't assume that responsibilitymyself . I have my hands full with the blowout . " " Do you think the blowout had anything to do with what 's happened to your niece ? " " I do n't quite understand . You mean some environmentalist maniac is responsible ? " " I was n't suggesting that . I 'm a bit of an environmentalist myself . So was  --  " I realized as I caught myself that I half believed Laurel was dead . " Your niece is , too . " " Then what exactly did you mean ? " he said . " The family 's been getting a lot of publicity this week , some good , some bad . You and her father were on television last night . His picture was in the paper . " " But not Laurel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . And she 's the one who got taken . " A woman 's voice said from the hall , " Who got taken ? " She brushed past Smith in the doorway , a well-made woman who looked as if she had dressed in a hurry and had n't brushed her blond hair . Captain Somerville got to his feet . " Laurel was kidnapped tonight . " He gave her a few of the details : the amount of the ransom , the fact that Sylvia was willing to pay it . Then he turned to me . " Mr. Archer here is a private detective . I was about to ask him if he could help us in this matter . He saw Laurel earlier this evening . " The woman gave me a long look , then her hand . " I 'm ElizabethSomerville , Laurel 's aunt . " I could see a resemblance to her brother Jack in the handsomebones of her face . But her eyes were different , and they were her best feature . They were blue and candid , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How did you happen to see Laurel ? " I told her , not omitting the sleeping pills . Sleeping Beauty 50 " Poor Laurel . Can you help her , Mr. Archer ? And help us ? " " I can try . I 'll need your brother 's cooperation . " " I 'm sure you 'll have that . " She was wrong . When Somerville called her brother 's house in Pacific Point , Jack Lennox refused to listen to him . The rest of us in the study could hear Jack shouting over the line . Somervilleslammed the receiver down . " Jack wo n't talk to me . He said he 's got to keep his house line open . He does n't want any interference . " " He 's going to get it , though , " Elizabeth Somerville said . " I do n't trust Jack to handle this by himself . He 's terribly upset  --  I could hear it in his voice  --  and when my brother gets that way he makes wrong decisions . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was querulous . " I 've had less than two hours ' sleep in the last forty-eight , and tomorrow is going to be a really tough day . We 're going to try and plug the leak tomorrow . " His wife was watching him with a mixed expression on her handsome face , part pity and part impatience , which made me realize that she was much younger than he was . " What about your company 's security people ? " I said . " Ca n't you use them ? " " It 's a possibility , " the Captain said . But his wife said , " No . It is n't a good idea . " I asked her why it was n't . " Because my father 's still the head of the company . The kidnapping would get back to him within a couple of hours , and I think it 's really important that it should n't . At least until it 's over and Laurel 's back safe . " " Is your father very old ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's already had one heart attack , a bad one . Will you drive me down to Pacific Point , Mr. Archer ? Jack will listen to me , and I 'm sure that he 'll cooperate with you . " I was n't so sure , after what I had seen of Jack , but I said that I 'd go with her. 51 " What about me ? " Captain Somerville said . " Go back to bed , " his wife told him . " Smith will look after you . Wo n't you , Smith ? " The black man in the doorway broke his silence . " Certainly will , Mrs. Somerville . " She looked at him intently . " What was that shot that woke me up ? " " There was a rat in the pool house , " he said with some embarrassment . " But I told you not to shoot them . Trap them if you have to . " " All right , Ma'am . I 'll try that . " " Do it , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice than he had been using . " I give the orders to Smith . Remember that , Elizabeth . " She offered no sign that she had heard him . The two men looked past her at each other . Each of them smiled faintly . I got the impression that their relationship was deeper and stronger than the marriage , and that it shut her out . Before we left , I tried to call Tom Russo . There was no answer at his house , and the drugstore was closed . XElizabeth Somerville came to the front door in a tourmaline mink which almost matched her blond head . It seemed to me she was overdressed , considering her errand . She may have caught my look , because she went back into the house and put on a plain dark coat . Sleeping Beauty 52 " My family , " she said in the car , " has a fatal gift for ostenta-tion . " " You look even better in that coat . " " Thank you  --  thank you very much . " Her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliment for some time . We rode in unstrained silence down the dark hill . I had liked the woman at first sight , just as I had liked Laurel , and for some of the same reasons : their honesty and passionate directness , their concern . But Laurel was a troubled girl , and the woman beside me seemed to have everything under control . Except perhaps her marriage , which seemed to be on her mind : " I 'm not about to explain or apologize for anything . But you must have gotten a rather odd view of us . This dreadful oil spill has thrown the family into a crisis . And now with what 's happened to Laurel  --  " She took in a deep breath and let it out . I turned onto the lighted boulevard , heading for the San Diego Freeway . " I know how you feel . " " How could you possibly ? " " In a situation like this , people get to know each other in a hurry . That is , if the components are present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideways at her face . She was smiling in a slightly feline way . I said : " I do n't think you and I are going to have an explosion . Do n't misunderstand me  --  I 'm sure you 're highly explosive , just as Laurel is . " " Really ? You think I 'm like Laurel ? " She sounded both complimentedand dismayed . " They do say an aunt and a niece have about thirty percent of the same genes  --  almost as close a relationas mother and daughter . And I feel that way about her . " She leaned toward me . " What happened to Laurel ? " " I do n't know . I think she was ready for almost anything , and very close to the edge of emotional breakdown . I 'm not offering this as a theory , just an idea , but I would n't be surprised if the53kidnapping was a spur-of-the-moment thing . Perhaps somebody recognized her and saw she was vulnerable and picked her up on the street . It may have been someone she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're not suggesting that she 's a party to the extortion attempt ? " " No , but it 's not impossible . " I was thinking of what Joyce Hampshire had told me about the Las Vegas incident when Laurel was fifteen . I decided not to mention it to Elizabeth . She said , " But she 'd have no reason . Laurel does n't care about money . And if she did , she could always get it from my parents . " " Not her own ? " " Jack and Marian do n't have much money in the here and now . The company pays him a good salary , of course , but they live right up to it , and beyond . I do n't mean that they could n't or would n't raise money for Laurel if they had to . " " Money is n't always the main thing in these extortion attempts . The extortioner may think it is . But what he 's really after is some kind of emotional satisfaction . Some kind of revenge on life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do n't know . They 've certainly had a lot of trouble with her . And she with them , " Elizabeth added carefully . " Jack and Marian have had a troubled marriage . But all three of them really care about each other . I suppose it 's what they call a lovehaterelationship . Odi et amo . Excrucior . " " What does that mean ? " " I hate you and I love you . And it hurts . ' That 's my own translation from Catullus . They printed it in the annual at River Valley School . " " The same school Laurel went to . " " Yes . You know quite a lot about her . " " Not nearly enough . I did n't have much of a chance to questionher husband . He was at work . " Sleeping Beauty 54 " He would n't be able to tell you much , anyway , " she said with faint contempt . " Why do you say that ? " " He does n't really know Laurel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent some time with them , and if ever I saw an unreal marriage  --  " " Tom seems to be in love with her . " " Whatever that means , " she said . " As far as Tom is concerned , she 's a creature of romantic fantasy . He treats her as if she were a fairy princess . Laurel really deserved something better than that . " Her voice was surprisingly bitter . I wondered if she was talking about her own marriage as well as Laurel 's . " How did  --  how does Laurel feel about him ? " And how do you feel about your husband , Mrs. Somerville ? " I think she loved him , in a way , and she was grateful to him . It is n't easy for Laurel to be intimate with anyone , certainly not with a man . But she really should have had something more than Tom Russo . She 's a remarkable young woman . If she had met her match in life , this dreadful thing would n't have happened . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . " She shook her head . Her hair fluffed out , and caught the light of a car coming up behind us . " After what you said about her possible complicity , I do n't think I ought to speculate about it . " " I was speculating . " " You certainly were . " " But I thought the question ought to be raised . I 'm not suggestingthat Laurel originated the idea . At worst , she simply went along with it . " " Why would she ? " " She wanted out , and she was so desperate that any out would do . Assume she did go with someone , and that someone made the extortion call to her parents , with or without her55knowledge  --  it does n't follow that Laurel is out of danger . In fact , it works the other way around . " " You mean if she knows who she 's with , he 's just as likely to kill her ? " " That 's what I mean . He or they . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said with synthetic scorn . " What else can I do ? I said I was n't offering you a theory , just some possibilities . You seem to take them seriously . So do 1 . Remember , I spent some time with Laurel just before she took off . She was wide open to possibility , ready for anything to happen . And if she ran into someone else in the same condi-tion  --  " " The nuclear components would come together ? " Her voice was sober . We climbed the ramp onto the midnight freeway . I was keenly aware that I 'd brought Laurel this way a few hours before . " Speaking of nuclear bombs , " Elizabeth said , in the tone of someone hoping to change the subject , " this is n't the first time tonight that they 've come up . My husband was talking about bombing earlier this evening , before I persuaded him to go to bed . I know men are n't supposed to have hysterics , but he was pretty close to it . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have , particularly in the last couple of days . I have to make allowances for that , and for the fact that he 's older . " She seemed to be having a quiet debate with herself on the subject of her husband 's manhood . " What did he have to tell you about bombing ? " " Nothing worth hearing , really . If anyone but Ben had said it , I would have laughed in his face . He had the wild idea that perhaps our oil well started leaking because some enemy had planted a small nuclear device in the sea floor . Of course , he was very tired , and he ca n't drink  --  " " Some enemy of the United States ? " " He did n't go quite that far . Some personal enemy , or enemySleeping Beauty 56of the company . Or someone trying to make the oil industry look bad . " " It is n't possible , is it ? " " No . " Her voice was definite . " I think my husband may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a sensitive man , and I know he feels terribly guilty . He told me once himselfthat he was too emotional to be a naval combat officer . He said he realized it when he saw the official photographs of the fire-bombing of Tokyo . He was appalled by them . " " Did he have something to do with the Tokyo bombings ? " " No . I did n't mean that . But this oil thing is n't his first disaster . It 's the second one that he  --  that he was made to feel responsible for . His ship the Canaan Sound was disabled by fire at Okinawa , and some of his men were lost . " " Was it his fault ? " " He was the Captain . He naturally assumed responsibility . But Ben has never talked about it . Neither has Jack . I do n't think either of them knows how the fire started . " " Was your brother Jack aboard the Canaan Sound ? " " Yes . Jack was a young officer just out of Communications School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be under his wing . It was n't a very protective wing , I 'm afraid . Jack was n't on the carrier for more than a week or two when it was ordered to Okinawa , and then burned . That was the end of Jack 's sea duty , and the end of my husband 's naval career . " " You mean they fired him out of the Navy ? " " Not exactly . They gave him shore duty at Great Lakes . Ben hated it . So did I. But it was much harder on him than it was on me . When I married him , he was terribly ambitious . He used to talk about someday becoming CINCrnC . The job at Great Lakes led nowhere , and was n't intended to . As soon as the war was over , Ben resigned from the Navy . Fortunately he was married to me , and my father took him into the company . " Her voice had dropped into the half-conscious rhythm of memory . She was aware of my presence , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . She was telling herselfabout her life , and finding out how it sounded . " Is this the end of your husband 's career in the oil business ? " " I do n't know . It feels like the end of a lot of things to me . " Her voice dropped out of hearing , but I sensed its quiet rhythms continuing in her mind . Then it was audible again : " I 'm afraid my father has turned his back on us . We disappointed him by having no children . Now he 's got himself a woman named Connie Hapgood . She used to be a teacher at River Valley School , and she 's actually younger than I am . Younger than I ever was , " she added in a flash of wry and angry wit . " Father is in his seventies , but he plans to marry her as soon as his marriage to Mother is dissolved . He 's even talking about having another family . " " Talking will do no harm . " " He means it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that woman 's help , that he can have a second life . And of course she 'll do her best to get Ben fired and put her own people in . There were rumors of it even before the blowout , and now that it 's happened I 'm afraid Ben 's finished . " " But the blowout was pure accident , was n't it ? " " It must have been . Of course . But Father will blame Ben . Father has always had to have someone to blame . " The sentence came out heavy and cold , like a capsule history of her early life . After a while , she added : " One of the planets  --  I forget which one  --  takes something like a hundred and sixty-five years to revolve around the sun . It makes for a long long year . And that 's the kind of a year our family seems to be having . " " Neptune ? " " It may be Neptune . He 's the god of the sea , is n't he ? Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But please do n't suggest that possibility to my husband . He 'd be only too willing to believe it . " XIWe rode in silence , like companions on a journey to inner space , until we left the freeway at Pacific Point . Elizabeth told me how to find her brother 's house , just south of the city limits in the suburb of Montevista . As we turned down the driveway , the night sky was blacked out by overarching trees . Then it opened out ahead of us , flooded by moonlight , floored by the glittering sea . In that perspective , the house which clung to the edge of the cliff looked small and low . All its windows were lit . I parked by a masonry wall on the left side of the driveway . " Let me do the talking , " Elizabeth said . " All right . But I want to come in . " She looked into my face . " Why ? It will be easier for me to talk to Jack and Marian alone . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I did n't come along for the ride . " " Very well . Come in if you like . " " I do n't like . I 'd rather be home in bed . But I will if you insist . " She drew in her breath in a little gasp of irritation , which she controlled . Her gloved hand pressed my arm . " Do n't get angry , Mr. Archer . Jack is about all I can handle at any one time . " As if to demonstrate the truth of this , Jack Lennox came out through a gateway in the stone wall . He carried a rifle with a59telescopic sight , and before I guessed his intention he was beside the car and pointing it at my head . I froze , half out of the car . The fear of death thrilled through me . I said carefully : " Put it down , Mr. Lennox . Do n't you recognize me ? " He glared along the barrel for an instant . He did n't seem to care who I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer pointed at me . I straightened up . Cold fear and anger boiled up in my head like liquid air . I wanted to take the rifle out of his hands and throw it cartwheelingover his house , far out over the cliff , into the sea . His sister felt the violent possibility of the scene . She hurried around the car and came between us , speaking to him in a voice that adults use on children . " Give me that , Jack . You do n't need it . Mr. Archer came here to help you . " " I do n't want his bloody help . " His voice was thick with alcohol and passion . " Come on , Jack . Straighten up now . I know you 're under bad strain but the rifle just makes it worse . " He was holding it pointed approximately at the moon , which floated low like a target balloon . The woman reached for the gun . They wrestled for a second , more with their wills than their muscles . Her will won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he let her . Without it he looked strangely empty-handed . He was one of those men who need a gun to complete themselves . The three of us moved awkwardly to the house . Marian Lennox was waiting just inside the front door , as if she had been afraid to come out . " I told you it was Elizabeth , " she said to her husband . Her voice was monotonous and her movements limp , as if her nerves had been strained too far and gone slack . But she took the rifle from her sister-in-law and stood it in a corner of the hallway . Jack Lennox scowled at the two women , and turned the same face on me : Sleeping Beauty 6o " You had no right to come here . You 'll ruin everything . " He was full of grief and anger , and spoiling for a fight . I was n't . I said : " Your sister asked me to come . I think it was a good idea . People should n't try to handle these things by them-selves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said without conviction . " Have you had a second call yet from the kidnappers ? " " No . " " Exactly what was said in the first call ? " He looked at me with suspicion . " What do you want to know for ? " " I 'd like to get some idea of who we 're dealing with  --  whether they 're amateur or pro  --  " " You 're not doing the dealing . We are . " " I understand that . I 'm not trying to interfere . " " Of course you 're trying to interfere . You walked into my house uninvited and unwanted . You do n't give a damn about us , or about what happens to my daughter . " " I do , though . That 's why I 'm here . " He shook his head . " You 're spying for Tom Russo , are n't you ? How do I know he is n't involved in this ? And maybe you are , too , for all I know . " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk for him . I did n't know how seriously to take him . The gun was still resting upright in the corner . The two women were standing , as if by design , between the gun and him . It seemed to me that I had already spent a long time in the hallway with Jack Lennox and his sister and his wife and his bloody gun . It was an ugly cold dark room without any furniture , like a holding cell for prisoners waiting for paroles that never came . His wife approached him with one hand stretched out . She was pale and enormous-eyed and awkward in her movements , as if she had been in solitary for years . Her hand paused in the air before it touched him. 6i " You must n't get so excited , Jack . You said that yourself . We 've got to keep a clear head or the family will never get through this alive . He 's liable to phone now any time . " " Has he threatened to kill your daughter ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His wife took hold of his raised right arm . He flung her away from him , and she almost fell . " For God 's sake , Jack , " Elizabeth said , " calm down . " " Then take this spying bastard out of here . " She moved past him to the door and opened it . " Out , Mr. Archer , please . " The heavy door clicked shut behind me . The air was cool on my face . The moon soared above the sea . In the middle distance , a screech owl made small weird grouchy noises like nature talkingback to the world of men . But I was n't interested . I wanted to be inside the house , in the cell with the prisoners , waiting for the second telephone call . I waited for nearly an hour . It seemed to stretch out like time on the planet Neptune . The screech owl spoke occasionally . I had nothing to say in return . Then the telephone rang in the house , once . It required an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly responsible for the danger Laurel was in , and I did n't trust her father to get her out of it . I reached for a cigarette . I had n't smoked a cigarette in several years , but I felt defrauded when I could n't find one . I sat and bit my lips and listened to the slow ponderous clock of the waves at the foot of the cliff . Elizabeth came out alone . She walked very slowly toward my car , as if the house behind her exerted a magnetic influence . I got out and opened the car door for her . In the light of the moon , she looked pale and subdued . " Did the kidnappers phone again ? " " Yes . Jack talked to one of them . A man . " Sleeping Beauty 62 " What did the man say ? " " Jack asked me not to discuss it with you . He wants to handle it alone . That 's his way , especially where Laurel is concerned . " " He 's making a mistake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well have been talking to that wall . " She pointed toward the stone wall that enclosed the house . " I 'm afraid he does n't trust you . He does n't trust anyone , not even me . " " Has he always been like that ? " " Not really . I think he 's breaking down under the strain . " She was silent for a moment ; then she shook her head in denial . " That 's really unfair to Jack . He 's terribly eager to do the right thing and do it all by himself . He has n't been the best and most understanding father in the world , and there 's been a lot of trouble between him and Laurel . I 'm sure he feels that if he can save her now , and show her how much he loves her  --  " Her voice dropped again , as if she could n't imagine the sequel to this . " It 's a poor time for grandstanding . Her life is in danger . She may be dead now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ? " " I do n't know . " " Did he ask to talk to her ? " " I do n't know , " she repeated . " He took the call in his study , and kept the door closed . He promised to deliver the hundred thousand tomorrow . That was all he told me about the conversation . " When tomorrow ? " " Early in the afternoon , I gather . Jack said he 'd need the money around noon . " " Would there be any point in trying to talk to him now ? " " For you to try ? " " Either of us . Or both . " She considered the idea . " I 'm afraid not , Mr. Archer . It 's better not to press Jack when he 's feeling like this . Perhaps tomorrow  --  " 63I turned the key and started the car . As I was backing away from the wall , the front door opened . Marian Lennox came toward us , stumbling on the flagstone walk and waving . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both got out to meet her . Elizabeth said in a slightly bedside manner : " What is it , Marian ? " " Jack had a dizzy spell . I got him to lie down . " " He has n't had a heart attack ? " " No . He 'll be all right . " " Do you think we should call a doctor ? " " I 'm afraid that would only upset him . " Elizabeth put her arm around the other woman 's shoulders . " I 'll stay with you if you like . " " No . You 're awfully kind . But Jack and I have to do this by ourselves . It 's the way Jack wants it . " " What about you ? " " I 'm willing to do whatever Jack says . He 's the strong one . " " I think you 're showing a lot of strength , Marian . " Marian shook her head and drew away , ending their moment of affection . " I 'm only doing what I have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvia gets hold of the money by noon . That 's all we 're asking of you . " " Do n't worry , dear . " Marian Lennox turned to me before she went inside . Her face was like a clay mask in the moonlight : " I 'm sorry , Mr. Archer . After coming all this way , you should have been given a better reception . " " That 's all right . " " You will let us know if you find out anything ? " I said I would . She moved back toward the house as if she dreaded both what was ahead of her and what was behind her . She let herself in at the front door . " Poor Marian , " Elizabeth said . " Poor both of them . I wish I could help them . " Sleeping Beauty 64 " Has your brother ever had a heart attack ? " " No , but my father almost died of one a few years ago . " She added after a thinking pause , " That was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly realized that he was mortal , and he decided to make the most of the life he had left . So when he was physically able he took up with Connie Hapgood . " Mother 's a proud woman . Also she has some money of her own . She moved out of the old house in El Rancho and bought a house on the beach here . " " Is that where we 're going now ? " " Yes . It 's only a mile or so from Jack 's house . " She gestured toward the south . " Which was the big attraction for Sylvia , I suppose . Jack was always her favorite . " Her voice was cold without being bitter . " She should have stayed and fought it out with Connie . She could have held on to Dad if she 'd wanted to . But she did n't care . She left him to that woman . And now she 's letting him dissolve the marriage without even putting up a fight . " " Why does it matter so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not going to live forever . And if Connie inherits the company , or even a major part of it , that will be the end of the Lennox family . Money is the glue that holds us all together  --  money and oil . " I turned south along a dark tree-lined road which paralleled the shore . A barn owl flew across the space of sky between the trees , moving as silently as a fish under water . The woman was almost as quiet for a while . Finally she said in an unwilling voice , " Dad loves Laurel , you know . She 's his only grandchild . And if Jack is covering up for her in some way , you can understand why . Laurel is his ace in the hole . " " Are you telling me that you think Laurel may not have been kidnapped after all ? " " I guess I am . At least I 'm admitting the possibility . " " What made you change your mind about it ? " " I do n't really know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a feeling there 's something funny going on . There 's a queer atmosphere in Jack and Marian 's house tonight  --  what you might call an atmosphere of complicity . " " You think they know that Laurel 's trying to take them ? " " I think they know something like that , or at least Jack does . It would n't be the first time that he 's covered up for Laurel . " " Tell me about the other times . " " I do n't think I 'd better , " she said . " You would n't see them in context , and I do n't want to turn you against her . She may need your help . We all may . " " Good . What was the context ? " She thought about the question , and answered in general terms : " When there 's trouble in a family , it tends to show up in the weakest member . And the other members of the family know that . They make allowances for the one in trouble , try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're implicated themselves . Do you follow me ? " " I learned it long ago in the course of my work . Where did you learn it , Elizabeth ? " " From my family . Yes , do call me Elizabeth , please . " XIIWe turned right on Seahorse Lane , which dipped toward the sea , and turned again at Mrs. Lennox 's mailbox . Her name was painted on it in new black lettering : " SYLVIA LENNOX . " The house at the end of the cypress-haunted lane was single-storied , and sprawled like a stucco labyrinth along the edge of the sea . A young man came out across the lighted courtyard to meetSleeping Beauty 66us . He was of normal size but he gave the impression of being dwarfed by his surroundings . He walked on his toes like a dancer , ready to move in any direction . His moist brown eyes looked rather eager to please . " How are you , Mrs. Somerville ? " " I 'm fine , " she said in a tone that denied it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is Tony Lashman , my mother 's secretary . " We shook hands . He told Elizabeth that her mother was waiting in her room to see her , and she excused herself . From the window of the front room where Lashman took me , I could look out across the beach and the water and see the lighted oil platform . I could n't tell how close the oil had come to shore , but I could sense its odor invading the house . The young man sniffed . " Filthy stuff . " " How does Mrs. Lennox feel about it ? " " She 's pretty ambivalent . " He gave me a quick sharp look to see if I understood what he was saying . " After all , she 's been married to an oilman most of her life . " " Do you know old Mr. Lennox ? " " As a matter of fact , I 've never met him . I 've only been with Mrs. Lennox since she and her husband agreed to separate . " He ran his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much a temporary thing for me . I 'm going back to college in the fall . Or else to photography school . I have n't decided . I only took this job to help Mrs. Lennox out . " " I understand her granddaughter has been staying here . " " That 's right , she 's been using the guesthouse . " He turned to face me . " I heard she 's missing . " " Yes . " " I 'm not surprised . She was n't too happy here . Or anywhere else , for that matter . I did my best to cheer her up , but it did n't do too much good . " His eyes reflected a facile sympathy , but it soon faded . There seemed to be a restless movement behind them , a constant turning in his head like an occulting light. 167 " How did you cheer her up ? " " We played a lot of tennis  --  she plays a fairly good game of tennis . And we had some good old heart-to-heart talks , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the same way myself  --  creative . Laurel and I have quite a lot in common . I went through a marriage that did n't work out myself . " " Her marriage did n't work out ? " " I did n't mean to say that , exactly . " He touched his mouth with his fingers . " Laurel had n't really made up her mind about it , but I could tell which way it was likely to go . It 's hard to imagine her married to a druggist . " " Why ? " I said . " You know , a girl with all that charm and class . And all that money in the background . " He made an inclusive gesture toward the contents of the room . The heavy dark furniture , devoid of charm , failed to support him . There was money there , I thought , but it had n't been wholly humanized . " How much rnoney is there in the background ? " " Millions and millions . " The thought of the money seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unrequited passion . I doubted that Laurel was . He became aware that Elizabeth had come into the room . As if the light had altered , embarrassment changed his face and made it almost ugly . But if she had overheard him talking about her family 's money , she gave no sign . " My mother would like to see you , " she said to me . She led me through another wing of the house , to a closed white door which she opened . " Mr. Archer is here , Mother . " Sylvia Lennox was a thin elegant woman sitting on a canopied bed . A round be.dside table held a pink telephone , a glass of water , and two red pills . She lifted her head at a consciously attractive angle . But in spite of her silk cap and robe , and theSleeping Beauty 68room that surrounded her like the interior of a pink cloud , she looked rather like an aging boy . " My lawyer , Emerson Little , tells me that you know John Truttwell . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He seems to have a high opinion of you . " " I 'm glad to hear that . I 'm also glad you 've been in touch with your lawyer . " " Yes . Emerson will make the arrangements in the morning . " She turned to her daughter . " May I talk to Mr. Archer alone for a minute ? " " Certainly , Mother . " Elizabeth was a little awkward in her presence . " Could you possibly not call me Mother , dear ? I 've asked you to call me Sylvia . " " Yes , Sylvia . " Elizabeth went out , shutting the door a little harder than necessary , but not quite hard enough to upset the wary balance beween her and her mother . Mrs. Lennox waved me into a chair beside her bed . " I love my daughter dearly , " she said without heat , " but she 's terribly conscious of the generations . I suppose a woman gets that way when she marries an older man . When Elizabeth met Captain Somerville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1944 , when they were married , she was just out of Vassar and barely twenty-one . She thought it would be romantic to be married to a Navy captain , and my husband arranged the marriage . Of course he was thinking of the future of the company  --  he always had two reasons for doing any one thing he did . " There was acid in her voice , and it etched lines in her face . " But , " she added a little belatedly , " you 're not interested in our family history . " " I am , though . You and your daughter are very candid . " " I taught her that , if not much else . She was her father 's daughter . " Her experienced blue eyes came up to the level of69mine and rested there coolly . " What did Elizabeth have to say about me ? " I decided to match her candor . " That you 'd left your husband , for cause . That you had money of your own . That you were very fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . She 's my only grandchild . " A fine nest of wrinkles had formed around her eyes , and her look was partly quizzical , partly wincing . " You sound as if you 're interested in my money . I do n't mean that as an accusation . Most people are . " " I 'm not particularly . Older people 's money can be expensive to buy . " Her head came up as if I had insulted her . But she seemed to see in my face that that had n't been my intention , and she subsided . " I 'm interested in your money to this extent , " I said . " I understand you 're putting up the ransom for Laurel . " " Yes . I ca n't afford it , but I 'm willing . If Laurel needed it , she could have everything of mine . " She moved her thin arm in a gesture which seemed to take in the house and everything it contained . " You 're very generous . " " Not really . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Laurel . But if she were gone permanently , I would n't have much reason to go on living . " She leaned toward me with restrained eagerness . " Elizabeth mentioned that you saw her tonight . " " Yes . " I told her quickly what had happened between Laurel and me . " I should n't have let her get away from me . I knew she needed help , but I did n't want to admit it to myself . I was n't prepared to give it , I suppose . " She reached for me with her narrow brown hand and touched me on the knee . " You 're fond of her , too , are n't you ? " " Fond is n't quite the word . She made a deep impression on me , and I 'm concerned about her . " Sleeping Beauty 70 " What sort of an impression ? " " Dark and troubled , " I said . " At the same time quite strong , in her way , and valuable , even beautiful . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening out on the ocean here seemed to affect her as if it was happening to her own body . " The old woman nodded . " You put it very well . She has so much empathy it 's virtually psychotic . And I think it was this oil spill , with her own family involved in it , that set her off . " " Is she psychotic ? " " One or two doctors have thought she had psychotic tenden- cies . One of them came up with the opinion  --  this was several years ago , some time before Laurel got married , and she was going through a particularly bad spell  --  I was afraid she might kill herself , in fact  --  " Her blue eyes widened and filled up with fear which turned inward , away from me . After a blank time , she said , " What was I saying ? " " You were going to tell me about the doctor 's opinion . " " Yes , I remember now . He thought that Laurel had been frightened or shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left her permanently shaken . He could n't get at the source of it  --  her memory had blanked out . " " Was he a psychiatrist ? " " Yes . Laurel has seen several psychiatrists . But she did n't stay with any of them long . This may seem a strange thing to say about a girl who has suffered as much as Laurel and made so many mistakes . But I do n't think she wants to be any different . And of course she 's had her good times . She seemed quite con- tent this last week here with me . " " I 'd like to look at her room . " " Of course . Elizabeth will show it to you . Laurel spent her nights in the guesthouse . Apparently she liked the isolation . " " What did she do in the daytime ? " " Her days were quite full , actually . She read , listened to music , walked on the beach  --  " " Alone ? " 71 " So far as I know . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal interest in him , I 'm sure . She 's still in love with her husband ; she told me so herself . " " Then why did she leave him ? " " He got on her nerves , she told me . She could n't bear to live in such intimacy , especially in that dreary little house . I would have been glad to help them buy another house , but her husband would n't hear of it . He 's very much attached to that awful house of his . Apparently he 's lived in it all his life . " " He 's very independent . " " Yes . I suppose it 's a virtue in a man . " " Not in a woman ? " " I do n't know . I 've always been a little too independent myself . And I 've ended up quite alone in the world . " The wincing , quizzical look was pinching her eyes again . " Now I 'm starting to complain about my lot , and that means it 's time to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . Would you be good enough to hand me my sleeping pills ? " " In a minute . Was Laurel on barbiturates ? " " No . " " Has she ever been ? " " Not to my knowledge . " " What about other drugs ? " " She 's always been quite careful about drugs . I taught her that . I 've never believed in them . I only started taking Seconal because I was waking up so terribly early . I 'd wake up long before dawn and listen to the seconds of my life ticking away and wonder what I could do for Laurel . " She moved restlessly . " Well , now there is something I can do . " " You mean the money . " " Yes . I mean the money . I want you to see that Jack delivers it properly . My son has many good points , but he does tend to get excited in emergencies . " " I 've noticed that . " " Will you go along with him when he delivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking me to take quite a responsibility , Mrs. Lennox . " " Elizabeth says that you 're a responsible man . " " Jack may not think so . " " I 'll talk to him in the morning . I 'll make it a condition thatyou go along . We do n't want any slip-ups . Are you willing ? " I said I was , but I added , " Before we go any further , there'sone thing we ought to consider . " " About Jack ? " " About Laurel . I 've been told that when she was fifteen or so , she went to Las Vegas with a boy . They ran out of money and faked a kidnapping situation . I understand they collected a thousand dollars from her parents . " Her face hardened . " Did Jack and Marian tell you this ? " " No . I got it from another source . " " I do n't believe it . " " I do , Mrs. Lennox . " " Who was your source ? " " It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same trick is being repeated now , on a larger scale . " She looked at me with distaste . " My granddaughter is not a criminal . " " No , but sometimes people do things to their families that they would n't think of doing to anyone else . Especially a young woman who 's under the influence of a man . " " What man ? There is no man . " " It was a man who called your son tonight and asked for the money . " She lay back against her pillows and absorbed the implications . They seemed to shrink her body and her face . She said in a diminished voice : " I simply do n't believe it . Laurel would n't do such a thing to me . " " She does n't know you 're involved . " " Laurel would n't do it to her parents either . " " She did once . " Mrs. Lennox waved the fact away . " If what you heard is true73  --  which I seriously doubt . Even if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . She 's grown up since , and she 's really quite fond of her parents . Why , she went to visit them this very day . " She was tired and hurt and suddenly quite old . I rose to go . She stretched out a hand toward me : " Give me my pills , will you , please ? And a sip of water ? It must be terribly late , and I wake up so early . " I offered her the red pills in the palm of my hand . Her fingers pecked them up and placed them on her pale tongue . She drank the water as if it was hemlock . " Anyway , " she said , " I do n't care what she 's done , I want her back . I 'm willing to pay the money for her , sight unseen . " XIIII found Elizabeth in the big front room . " How did you get along with Mother ? ' . ' she said . " All right . She answered my questions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " There was a slight edge on her voice . I wondered if she was self-conscious about telling me so much about her life . " I 'm tired now , " I said . " But I 'd rather ask questions than have to answer them . " She looked at me with bright interest , as if I 'd revealed a weakness in myself . " I 'll remember that . Now , what about tomorrow ? " I told her what the plans were . " Jack wo n't want you to go along . You know that . " Sleeping Beauty 74 " Jack may have to put up with me , " I said . " Right now , I'dlike to have a look at the guesthouse where Laurel was staying . " She looked at the watch on her wrist . " It 's nearly two o'clock . " " I know that . It 's the only time I have . " She turned on an outside light and led me out through a slidingdoor onto a breezeway which deserved its name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over us from the sea . Several miles offshore , the platform that marked the source of the oil blazed like a Christmas tree . The guesthouse was a new-looking flat-roofed building which projected on pilings over part of the beach . The tide had gone out , and at the foot of the beach I could see the surf breaking white and sliding back into darkness . It looked as if the oil had n't reached shore yet . Elizabeth turned on the lights as we went in . The interior of he guesthouse was divided into living and sleeping quarters . The bed was unmade ; the twisted sheets looked like something that a prisoner had escaped from . Some dresses and a coat hung in the closet above a single empty pair of shoes . There was a sweater and some stockings and panty hose in the chest of drawers . Neither here nor in the bathroom could I find any drugs , legitimate or illegitimate . The only personal thing I found was a letter folded into a book of stories entitled Permanent Errors . The letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I stood under the light and read it through while Elizabeth watched me . Dearest Laurel : Business is good at the drugstore . It keeps me busy . I do not have much reason to go home these nights , and I have been taking over some of their night shifts from the other pharmacists . I would just as soon work at night than go home to an empty house . The days are not so had , it is the night that gets me down . After we got married and you were with me , I used to lie beside you when you were sleeping and feel like the luckiest man in the world . I used to lie there and count your breathing . I felt like a king. 75But sometimes I thought your breathing stopped and I would go into a panic until I could hear it again . Just for you to go on breathing was the most important thing in my life . It still is , Laurel . If you ca n't live in this house , all right , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market today , just say the word . We 'll move into an apartment or buy wherever you say . We do not have to go on living in L.A. if you do not want to . With my record of employment here at Save-More , I can get a job someplace else . And I will do it if you come back to me . You do not have to give me an answer right away , Laurel . Take your time . All I want is for things to work out for you . If you include me , I will be the luckiest man in the world . I will feel like a king again . All my love , TomI handed the letter to Elizabeth . She read it through . There were tears in her eyes when she had finished . She wiped at them ineffectively with her fingers , and turned away . " What 's the matter ? " " I feel so sorry for them . " " I thought you did n't approve of Tom . " " As a husband for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Laurel is so complex . " " That combination can make a match . " " I know it can . But in this case it has n't been working . He thinks he can bring her back , and close the gap between them , by moving to another house , or getting a job somewhere else . " " He 's a willing man , " I said , " more willing than I realized . If I had been half as willing , I could have held on to my own wife . " She gave me a direct bright look which went strangely with her tears . It passed through me like a laser beam assaying an unidentified object . My heart accelerated a little , and I wondered if her tears had been for herself as well as for Tom . She turned the letter over . " There 's something written on the back . It 's Laurel 's handwriting . " She read aloud : " You 're a sweet boy , and I do love you . ISleeping Beauty 76think I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And we will get another house . Or an apartment if we ca n't afford a house . And maybe we 'll have a child , after all . But you have to give me some time , Tom . I get these terrible dark depressions and then I do n't want to live in the world at all . Even with you . But I 'm fighting it . ' " Elizabeth 's voice broke . Her eyes were wet again . " I have n't cried for years , " she said . " What 's the matter with me ? " " You 're turning out to be human , after all . " She shook her head in short quick arcs like a child . " Do n't laugh at me . " " It 's better than crying . " " Not always . Not if you 've got something to cry about . " She turned her back on me and went to the window . Touched by emotion , her back was beautiful . The narrow waist blossomedout into strong hips , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond her on the water , the lights of the platform blazed cold . " It looks like a burning ship . " She sounded like a child recognizingsomething for the first time . Later she said in a colder , adult voice , " It 's a recurring theme . Other people burn their bridges behind them . We do things on a grander scale in our family . We burn ships and spill oil . It 's the all-American way . " She was losing the feeling stirred in her by Tom 's letter and Laurel 's unsent answer , dissipating it in irony . I moved up close behind her , not close enough to touch . " You 're taking this oil spill very hard . " " I suppose I am . " " Laurel did , too . " " I know that . " But it was n't Laurel she wanted to talk about . " It 's really made me take a look at my life . I was brought up to think in terms of gain . Not just financial gain  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you do in tennis . Make good77grades in school , have more friends than anyone , marry the most eligible man , and so on . But it really does n't work out too well if your gain has to be someone else 's loss . Or if the rules of the game turn out to be different from what you thought . " " I do n't quite follow that . " " I mean you might think you 're gaining , and be a loser . I am , and I knew it long ago , but I did n't have the courage to act on the knowledge . I 'd given up a boy I met in New York who probably would have married me if I 'd waited . But there were no points to be gained there  --  we were merely in love with each other . I married Ben because there was a war on  --  he was CaptainWar himself , going to be Commander-in-Chief Pacific someday . Also because my father wanted me to . He was in the oil business , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Navy . It was what they used to call a dynastic marriage , based on mutual gain . But I was the one who lost . " " What did you lose ? " " My life . I stayed with Ben and let it slip away from me . I should have left him in the first year of our marriage . But I was ashamed to admit that I was a loser . I was afraid that my father would turn against me . Now my father has turned around and done what I should have done . " " What happened in the first year of your marriage ? Do you mean the loss of your husband 's ship ? " " It was part of it , but the crucial thing happened before that . I lost Ben , or knew I 'd lost him , before he lost his ship . I never had him , really . He had a mistress at the same time that he was courting me , and he did n't even break with her when he married me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masculine point of view , but I was appalled by her . She could n't even speak grammatical English . " " You knew her ? " " I met her once . She came to see me in our new house in Bel-Air . Ben was at sea , and I was living there by myself . She came to the door one day , with her little boy , and told me sheSleeping Beauty 78needed money  --  just like that . When I asked her who she was , she explained to me that she was Ben 's girl . She was so matterof-factabout it I could n't be angry with her  --  at least not with the little boy there . I gave her some money and she drove away in her old beat-up car . " It was afterwards that I had the bad reaction . I could n't bear to live in the house any more . I wanted to burn it down . One night , I took a can of gasoline into Ben 's study . I intended to sprinkle it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set fire to it . At the last minute , I changed my mind . " But I decided I could n't go on living there . I went home to live with my parents and lent the house to Jack and Marian . Jack had just graduated from Communications School in the East , and he was waiting on the West Coast to join Ben 's ship . Everything happened so quickly in those days . The ship came into Long Beach Harbor in a few weeks , stayed for a night or two , and then went out again , with both my husband and my brother aboard . And then the ship caught fire off Okinawa , and that was the end of Ben 's career in the Navy . It was hardly more than a month between the time I carried the gasoline can into his study and the time his ship caught fire . I used to make a connection between the two things . " " You mean you imagined that you set fire to the ship ? " " Not exactly , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that woman came to see me , with her little boy , I think I must have been a little out of touch . For all I knew , he was Ben 's illegitimate son , though she said he was n't . " She was gazing at the lighted platform as if its cold blaze on the contaminated sea might be a symbol of her life and its meaning . She moved back against me . Then she stood very still as if she had frightened herself . I put my hands on her . " Do n't do that , " she whispered urgently . " Why not ? It 's better than burning ships and spilling oil . Or setting fire to houses . " XIVI dreamed I was sleeping with Laurel , and woke up guilty and sweating in her bed . Dawn was at the window , and so was Beth . Leaning into the cold marine morning , her unclothed body looked like a carved figurehead . I threw off the blanket she had covered me with . She turned with a start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " " What 's he doing ? " " Floating in the water . " I knotted a bath towel around my waist and went out . The man was spread-eagled on the surface beyond the place where the waves were breaking . He lay face down as if he was studyingthe bottom , and moved as the waves moved under him . I waded in through the surf . It rose like liquid pain around my body . It was bitterly cold and tinged with brown . Farther out , the oil lay on the water like a blotched undulating skin . I swam with my head and face held out of the water . When I got close to the floating man , I seemed to enter a special zone of cold . I tried to grasp him by the hair , but my hand slid off his scalp . It was dark with oil and almost hairless . Facing him and kicking hard , I took hold of him by the arms and turned him over . One of his arms flopped like a broken wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how badly , because he was in blackface from the oil . I got hold of him by the shirt collar and towed him in towardSleeping Beauty 8oshore . A wave broke over us and sucked him out of my grasp . He slid away from me in the brown surf , turned as he struck the sand , and rolled over and over . Beth was waiting for him just above the farthest reach of the waves , fully clothed except for her bare feet . She ran and held the dead man until I could reach him . Each of us took an arm , and we dragged him up the beach onto dry sand , as if either water or oil could do any further damage to him or his soaked tweed suit . I wiped his face with a corner of my towel . It was badly damaged : one eye socket was caved in . There were crinkled marks that looked like burn scars on one side of his face and on his scalp . The scars were not recent . " What do you suppose happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fallen off the oil platform ? " " It 's possible . But the platform 's quite a long way out  --  three or four miles . I do n't think he 's been in the water that long . And he is n't wearing working clothes . He may have fallen off a boat , or been caught and rolled by a high wave on the beach . He looks pretty frail . " As I said that , I remembered him in life . He was the bald uncertain little man I 'd seen with the younger man in Blanche 's Seafood Restaurant on the wharf . " Do you know him , Beth ? " She leaned over to look at him . " No . I never saw him before . He has nothing to do with us . " She straightened up , and turned . Her mother had come out of the house and started down the steps to the beach . Beth said to me in a low monotone , " Do n't call me Beth in front of Mother , please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not that , either . Please . Call me Mrs. Somerville if you have to call me anything . " Sylvia came up beside us , wrapped in a heavy wool robe which made her look androgynous and monklike . " Where did he come from ? " 81 " Mr. Archer was in the guesthouse . He saw the man in the water and swam out and brought him in . " Sylvia looked from her daughter to me , her eyes bright and dubious in her wrinkled boy 's face . " What do you suggest we do with him ? " " We 'd better call the police , " I said . " I really hate to do that , unless we know who he is , and what killed him . You know what the press and the news programs will make of this . Look at the fuss they 've been making about a few dead birds . " She bent over , her hands on her knees , and looked down at the ruined man as if he was a harbinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of death in her eyes . " Look . He 's got oil in his nostrils , oil in his mouth . That 's all they 'll need to ruin us . " " We ca n't just leave him lying here , " I said . " No . We 'll take him inside , into the guesthouse . " " Then you 'll really have trouble . It is n't a good idea , Mrs. Lennox . " She gave me a sharp look . " I did n't ask you for your opin-ion . " " But you 're getting it . Call the police . " " I think we 'd better , Mother . I 'll do it if you like . " They went toward the main house , the older woman 's feet dragging in the sand . There was a fresh morning wind blowing across the beach , and I was shivering so hard that I could n't see straight . The wet towel hung like a cold lead apron around my loins . I was lobster red in the trunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly . I searched the dead man 's clothes . The pockets of his tweed suit were empty . But inside the right breast pocket of the jacket , a label had been sewn by the tailor who made it : TAILORED FOR RALPH P. MUNGANJOSEPH SPERLINGSANTA MONICA , CALIF . DEC. 1955Sleeping Beauty 82Tony Lashman came out of the house and crossed the slantingbeach . He was fully dressed but his hair was uncombed and he was blinking in the morning light . He stopped blinking when he saw the dead man . Approachingwith a kind of unwilling fascination , he leaned above him and studied his damaged face . " Do you know him ? " I said . Lashman seemed to be startled by my question . He straightened up as if I 'd caught him in a compromising position : " No , I never saw him before . Who is he , anyway ? " " I do n't know . I just pulled him out of the water . " " What happened to his face ? " Lashman touched his own face , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He may have been struck with a blunt instrument . Or he may have gotten banged up on the rocks . " " You think he was murdered ? " " It 's a strong possibility . Are you sure you 've never seen him before ? " " Of course I 'm sure . " He backed away from the body as if death was a contagion . But he lingered not far away , and after a little time he spoke again . " You 're a private detective , is n't that right ? " " I work at it . " " What kind of money do you make ? " " A hundred a day and expenses . Why ? Does Mrs. Lennox want to know ? " " I was asking on my own account . I 've sometimes thought of going into the detective business myself . But I understood there was more money in it . " " There is for a few . But it 's not a way to get rich quick , if that 's what you 're looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What kind of background ? " " Most private detectives come out of police work . I used to be on the Long Beach force myself . " 83 " I see . " He gave me a discouraged look , and went back into the house . I stayed with the man 's body until the Sheriff 's deputies arrived . I told them I had seen him alive in Blanche 's Restaurant , but I did n't mention the tailor 's label sewn into the pocket of his suit . They could find it themselves if they looked . I went back into the guesthouse and took a hot shower . It failed to free me of the smell of oil or the chill that the dead man had left on me . I had more than one reason to take his death personally . I had pulled him out of the water ; and he was connected with the young man in the turtleneck who had frightened Laurel off the beach . XV-4:0-P4G4Before I got on the freeway to Santa Monica , I stopped at the harbor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . The floating oil had surged in with the morning tide and covered the surface of the enclosed water , coating the hulls of the boats lying at anchor and splashing the rocks and walls that lined the inner harbor . The black scene was barely relieved by a few white gulls with dirty feet . It was too early , and the front door of Blanche 's place was locked . There were violent noises somewhere in the back which sounded to my recently sensitized ears like somebody beating somebody else to death . It turned out to be a man in the kitchen pounding abaloneSleeping Beauty 84with a wooden mallet . I asked him through the screen door if Blanche was there . " Blanche never comes in this time in the a.m . She 's generally here by ten . " " Where does she live ? " He lifted his shoulders . " Do n't ask me . She likes to keep it a secret . She does n't give out her telephone number , either . Is it important ? " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night before as if the younger man accompanying the man in the tweed suit had asked Blanche a question , and she had pointed south along the beach . Possibly she could tell me where they had intended to go . I thanked the man and turned back toward land . Two cars had stopped in the restaurant parking lot , and several men got out . They wore business suits and hard hats , and they looked like engineers , or like publicity men trying to look like engineers . One of them was Captain Somerville . His face was closed and harried . I lifted my hand to him , but he did n't notice me , let alone recognize me . The Captain and his entourage headed past the restaurant to the landing area , where a truck was unloading heavy drums . On the way to Santa Monica , I listened to the morning news and learned that Lennox Oil was bringing in a wild-well team from Houston and preparing a major attempt to stop the spill . I switched off the radio and enjoyed the silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cars . Traffic was still fairly light , and the day was clear enough to see the mountains rising in the east like the boundaries of an undiscovered country . I lapsed for a while into my freeway daydream : I was mobile and unencumbered , young enough to go where I had never been and clever enough to do new things when I got there . The fantasy snapped in my face when I got to Santa Monica . It was just another part of the megalopolis which stretched85from San Diego to Ventura , and I was a citizen of the endless city . I found Joseph Sperling 's tailor shop in a side street off LincolnBoulevard . I remembered it as a pleasant street of shops , but the flow of time and traffic had eroded it . A real-estate office next to the tailor shop was standing empty , with photographs of unsold houses gathering dust in the window . The door of Joseph Sperling 's shop was locked . A cardboard clock with a movable hand hung inside the window and indicated that he would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I locked my car and went to a drive-in around the corner for breakfast . With the second cup of coffee , I finally warmed up and stopped shivering . When I went back to the tailor shop , Joseph Sperling was there . He was a small gentle-looking man with curly gray hair and bright eyes behind rimless spectacles . He looked at me as if he was estimating my measurements and planning a suit . " What can I do for you , sir ? " " Do you know Ralph P. Mungan ? " His eyes widened as if to register trouble , and narrowed down again in defense against it . " I used to know him quite well . Is Ralph in some kind of a jam ? " " The worst kind . " He leaned on a table , supporting himself on a bolt of fabric . " What does that mean , the worst kind ? " " He 's dead . " " I 'm sorry to hear it , very sorry . " " Were you close to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We have n't been close in a long time  --  not really what you could call close . But I knew Ralph in Fresno , where we grew up . I was a few years older than Ralph and Martha , and I came down here to the big city first . By the time they made the move , I owned the building next door as well as this one , and I rented it to them . " He looked a little afraid that I might not believe him . " Was this recently ? " Sleeping Beauty 86 " Not recently , no . It was over twenty years ago that they first came here . And nearly ten years since they left . What on earth happened to Ralph ? " " He drowned in the sea off Pacific Point . " Sperling 's face lost its color . " Are you from the police ? " " I 'm a private detective . " " Was it suicide ? " " I doubt it . Would you say Ralph was suicidal ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ralph was bitterly disappointed in his life  --  it had n't worked out the way he hoped . I do n't mean to insult the memory of a dead man , but Ralph did a lot of drinking in his day . He and his wife , Martha , used to drink and fight , fight and drink . Sometimes when I was sewing in the back "  --  he waved his hand toward an area behind a hanging green curtain  --  " I could hear them through two thicknesses of wall . " " I 'd like to talk to his wife . Have you seen her recently ? " " I 'm afraid I have n't . I have n't seen either of them in years . Anyway , I heard they went their separate ways . " " Divorced ? " " So I heard . Still , Martha will have to be told about this . I 'd rather you told her than have to do it myself . Or does she know ? " " I doubt it . It just happened last night or early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . " He gave me a sympathetic look . " I noticed you were a little blue around the gills . Why do n't you sit down ? I 'll see if I can find her number for you . " He pulled out a chair for me and left the room . The green curtain fell into place behind him . I sat and listened to the whisper and whir and stutter and roar of the boulevard . Sperling came back after a while with a memo pad in his hand . He tore off the top sheet and handed it to me . " Martha 's phone is n't listed , and neither is Ralph 's . But I got his number and address from a mutual friend in the real-87estate business . Ralph lives in Beverly Hills now  --  I mean he did live there . It looks as if he finally made it , after all . " I doubted it . The little old hairless man in Blanche 's Restauranthad looked as if he had never made it anywhere . But the address on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a very expensive city . " I suppose you could call his house , " Sperling said . " There may be somebody there who should be told . For all I know , Ralph may have married again . Some of us do and some of us do n't . But Ralph was the type who would , if you want my opinion . " Still I hesitated to place the phone call . I had the feeling that I had made a mistake , or was about to make one . " Can you tell me a little more about Ralph , Mr. Sperling ? " " What sort of thing do you mean ? " " Well , you made him a suit in 1955 . " " That 's right , I did . He could n't really afford it , but I gave it to him at cost for a birthday present . " He fell silent , and his sensitive eyes registered the implications of what I had said . " Was he wearing my suit when you found him ? "  --  . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost weight . The last time I set eyes on him , he was much too large in the waistline to get into that suit . We had a little joke about it at the time . He was too fat for his own good , but he still was a fine-looking man . " " Fine-looking ? " " I always thought so . So did Mrs. Sperling , when she was alive . " " How did he get the burns on his face and head ? " " Burns ? " " Yes . He was pretty badly disfigured . " " That must have happened since I saw him . " " How long ago was that ? " " A couple of years at least , more like three . I ran into him in Century Plaza . He was in a hurry , and we did n't spend muchSleeping Beauty 88time together . But he certainly had no burn marks on his head . I noticed what a fine head of hair he still had . " " Can you describe him for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he was middle-aged  --  he 'd be about fifty or so , with a tendency to stoutness , but Ralph was always light and fast on his feet . And always cheerful , except when he was drinkingand down in the dumps . " He looked past me at the light coming through the front window . " It 's hard to believe that Ralph is dead . " I did n't believe it myself . It was clear that there had been a mistake . I asked Sperling to let me use his phone . He took me into his back room , where suits in various stages of completion hung like the makings of artificial men ; then he delicately withdrewas I dialed the Beverly Hills number . A sedate woman 's voice answered : " This is the Mungan resi-dence . " " May I speak to Mr. Mungan , please ? " " Who shall I tell him is calling ? " I gave her my name and occupation . After a minute 's wait , he came to the phone . " Ralph Mungan speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " A private detective cooperating with the Orange County police . The body of a man came in with the tide this morning off Pacific Point . " " What man ? " " He was wearing a suit with your name sewn into it . " Mungan was silent for a moment . " I do n't like that . It makes me feel as if somebody walked on my grave . How could a thing like that happen ? " " I do n't know . I 'd like to come and discuss it with you . " " Why ? Is it somebody I know ? " " That 's possible . In any case , you may be able to help me identify him . May I come over , Mr. Mungan ? I wo n't take much of your time . " Reluctantly , he agreed . I left Sperling looking more cheerful . YVIRalph Mungan lived in a handsome Spanish house dating from prewar days . The lawn in front of it was green and smooth . There were waxwings on the pyracantha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating . I knocked on the front door and waited . I could see the tower of the city hall standing feudally against the sky . Mungan came to the door with his wife behind him . His fine dark head of hair was turning gray . He was short and heavy  --  so heavy that it was hard to imagine him wearing the same suit as the floating man . Mrs. Mungan had a face like ivory , smooth and hard , and a coil of black hair that probably was n't her own . The figure under her pink morning gown was n't all her own , either . In spite , or because , of these artifices , she looked a few years older than her husband . But her eyes were bright and interested . She led us into a sitting room where the three of us sat equidistant from each other on formal chairs . I could feel the lines of tension stretching like taut wires across the room . Without moving , Mungan gave the impression of squirming . " Well , " Mrs. Mungan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I told them about the man in the water . Sleeping Beauty 90She leaned toward me , baring part of her rib cage . " And it 's your theory , is it , that he was wearing Ralph 's suit ? " " It is n't my suit , " he said . " There 's some mistake . I never had a suit like that and I do n't know any man like that . " " Sperling the tailor said he made it for you . " His face swelled and darkened like a ripening plum . His wife looked at him , smiling rather intensely , and said in mock rail-lery : " What deep dark secret are you trying to cover up , dear ? " Mungan did n't respond right away . His gaze was inward , looking down the tunnel of the past . He made an effort which shook him to his foundations , and answered her smile with an equally ghastly one . " Okay , I confess . I murdered him myself . Now are you satis-fied ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jealousy , " he said . " What else ? He threatened to take you away from me , so I took him down and drowned him in the ocean . " Mrs. Mungan made a show of laughter , but she was n't happy with his answer . She gave him a quick insulted look , as if he had expressed a wish that she should be taken away from him , or drowned . She said : " We ca n't very well go to Palm Springs with this hanging over your head . Can we , Ralph ? " " There 's nothing hanging over my head . I was only kidding . " He grinned widely , toothlessly , mirthlessly . " I want to go to Palm Springs . I 've got golfing dates and business commitments . " " What business commitments ? " " We have an offer for the Palm Springs building , do n't for-get . " " I 've decided I do n't want to sell it . And I do n't want to go to Palm Springs . Go by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I would n't enjoy it . " " I would . Sometimes I think we see too much of each other . " He seemed appalled by the idea , as if she had suddenly pro-91posed a divorce . " Okay , we 'll give up the Palm Springs idea . I can call off my golf dates . As for the building , it 's bound to appreciate anyway . " " That does n't mean you ca n't go to Palm Springs . Go ahead . Do n't let me stop you . " " I do n't want to go to Palm Springs . I 'd be lonely . Lonely for you . " He gave her a lonely look which was still on his face when he turned in my direction . But he was n't lonely for either of us . I was getting impatient . " Did n't you own a real-estate office in Santa Monica ? " " I did n't own it . I rented the building . " " And Joseph Sperling had a tailor shop next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His face went through the motions of remembering , eyes widening and brightening with false pleasure . " Come to think of it , he did make me a suit at one time . That was way back in the fifties . " " A gray tweed suit ? " " That 's right . " " What happened to it ? " " I 'm sorry , I have n't the foggiest . I think I gave it to the SalvationArmy . " " When ? " " Just before we got married last year . I put on weight since that suit was made , and I realized I 'd never be able to wear it again . So I gave it to the Salvation Army . " I did n't believe him . Neither did his wife . She said gaily , " Are you sure you did n't drown the man , after all ? " " How could I ? I was home in bed with you . " Her eyes narrowed , as if he had offered her a further insult or threat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat on the outside . I stood up . " If you remember anything else , let me know . I 'll leave you a number to call . " " All right . " I gave Mungan the number of my answering service . HeSleeping Beauty 92wrote it down . Then he followed me to the door , and stepped outside . As soon as the door closed , he looked once behind him and moved along beside me , talking in a changed low anxious voice . " I remember something else . I do n't know whether I ought to tell you or not . I mean , can you promise it wo n't get back to my wife ? " " I ca n't promise that . It depends on what it is . " " You 're really putting me in a bind . " " I 'm sorry , but it is n't me doing it . The regular police should be here before long . And if you think you can avoid publicity by covering up evidence  --  it 's the surest way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face with both hands and looked at me between his fingers . " Do n't say that . It would really wreck my marriage . " " If your marriage is important to you , you better level with your wife and me . " He nodded heavily , and his head stayed down . " Yeah . I know . Sometimes it is n't so easy . " " Did you have anything to do with the man 's death ? " " Of course not . Of course I did n't . What do you think I am ? " " I 'll tell you when I know more about you , " I said . He dropped his hands , spreading them wide . He was a salesman , or an ex-salesman , who could n't bear to be disliked . " Look , " he said . " Could you and I take a ride around the block ? I do n't know what I 'll tell Ethel , but I 'll think of some-thing . " " Why not tell her the truth ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in my life that Ethel does n't know about . " " Is n't it about time you told her ? " He turned beside the open door of my car and looked at me as if I had just offered to push him down an elevator shaft . " No ! It is n't possible . " 93 " Get in and tell me about it . " He climbed in and I slammed the door on him . We were halfway around the block before he spoke : " I 've been married before . Ethel does n't know about it . " " I do . Her name was Martha . " He made a miserable face at me . " Did somebody hire you to investigate me ? " " Somebody will if you go on like this . " " That sounds like a threat . " " It 's more of a prediction . " I parked at the curb in front of a house with a mansard roof which had an old black Rolls parked in the driveway . " Tell me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the man I found in the ocean ? " " I do n't know . Maybe she can tell you . I 'm pretty sure I left the suit in the house when I took off . " " How long ago ? " " Let 's see , it 'll be four years next month . " " And where does your ex-wife live ? " " The last I heard , she was managing an apartment house in Hollywood . The Excalibur Arms . " I knew where it was . " Just keep my name out of it , will you ? " Mungan said . " Why is that so important ? " " Because I tell you it is . I 'm cooperating with you . You should be willing to cooperate with me . " " It wo n't be easy . It does n't matter what I do , your name is on that suit . The police will find it , if they have n't already . And they 'll be beating a path to your door . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm in a bind . " " Because you 've been married before ? That 's common enough . " " You do n't know Ethel . She can be very vindictive . So can Martie . If the two of them ever get together , I 'm finished . " " There must be more to this than you 're telling me . " Sleeping Beauty 94 " Yeah . There is . " He looked apprehensively up and down the street . " I would n't be surprised if Martie did this to me . She 's never forgiven me for leaving her , I know that . " " You mean she killed a man and put your suit on him just to get back at you ? " " No . " He looked rather sheepish . " I guess even Martie would n't do that . " " Then what 's the rest of it , Mungan ? " " There is no rest of it . " " There has to be . What is it ? " He answered a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't heard before . " A man should be able to change wives without living in hell for the rest of his life . Martie gave me good reason to leave her . She was drunk most of the time towards the end . I had a problem , too , I admit that . But I wanted to quit , and get out of that life . " And you met an older woman with some money . Almost as if he had heard me , Mungan went on : " A man has a right to a second chance . I proved that when I quit drinking . And Ethel helped me . We have our troubles like any other couple . But Ethel 's been good for me . She turned my footsteps onto the higher path . " That sounded like a quotation , perhaps from Ethel . " And now you want to drag me back into that rotten life . " All I really wanted , by this time , was to get away from him . Even if he had quit drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-pity running through them . I started the car . He took it as a rejection , and cast about for some way to stop me . " There 's something I have n't told you . " " Tell me now . " I raced the engine a little . " I got a Mexican divorce from Martie . I 'm not absolutely certain that it 's legal . " " You mean you know darn well it is n't legal ? " " That 's right . I paid a lawyer in Tijuana two hundred and95fifty dollars , but I found out later that the divorce did n't take . I was already married to Ethel by that time . " " So to speak . " " Yeah , so to speak . But Ethel watches me like a hawk , and it 's tied my hands . So now you know the bind I 'm in . All I 'm asking you to do is not tell Martie where I 'm living and who I 'm living with . I got the divorce in good faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crook ? And Ethel and I were married by a minister in Vegas . So all I 'm really worried about is Martie and her vindictiveness . " His fingers scratched lightly at my elbow . " Do n't tell Martie , eh ? " I said I would n't . When I dropped him off at his house , Ethel was waiting for him out in front . XVIIThe Excalibur Arms was on a side street off Sunset Boulevard , not very far from my office . It had been there as long as I could remember . Its four-story facade stood in the diluted sunlight like an old woman with a powder-caked face surprised by morning . I found the manager 's apartment , Number i on the ground floor , and rang the bell . A middle-aged man in his shirt sleeves came to the door chewing . The look in his eyes suggested that what he was chewing was bitter . " We have no vacancies , " he said around his cud . " Thanks , but I 'm looking for Mrs. Mungan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time ago . " Sleeping Beauty 96 " Do you have a forwarding address ? " " We might have . " He turned and shouted into his apartment , " Do we have an address for Martha Mungan ? " A woman 's voice answered , " I 'll see . " The man leaned on the doorframe . " You would n't be a bill collector , would you ? " " No . I simply want to talk to her . " He looked at me as if he did n't believe me , had n't believed anyone for a number of years . He shouted back into his apartmentagain : " What 's the holdup , anyway ? " " Wait a minute , ca n't you ? It took me a while to find the address book . " The woman appeared behind him . She had a face matching his , with wary eyes and lines of discontent running down from the sides of her nose . " The last we heard of Mrs. Mungan , she was managing a place called Topanga Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highway . " I ca n't swear she 's still there . She drinks , you know . " " Do n't tell her who told you , " the man added . " We have enough enemies as it is . " I did n't go directly to Topanga Court . It was several days since I had been in my office , and time I paid it a visit . It was on the second floor of a two-story building on Sunset . I parked in my slot behind it and went up the back stairs . Girls were twittering in the modeling agency next door . The name and occupation on my door , " Lew Archer : Private Investigator , " looked rather strange to me , and I understood how they might look to a client . There was no sign of any . The scattering of mail under the slot in the outer office was mostly advertisements and bills . I took the mail into the inner office , discarded the advertisements , and mentally added up the bills . The total came to about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check in97my pocket . I still had a couple of hundred in my checking account , but that was earmarked for the rent . I was n't anxious , though the traffic below the window seemed to have a slightly anxious sound , as if it could n't wait to get where it was going . I told myself I was better off than usual . I was in the middle of a case , dealing with people who had plenty of money . But I did n't want to have to depend on those people . I decided to call Tom Russo and see where we stood . The cousin answered , " This is the Russo residence . " " Archer speaking . " She dropped her formal tone . " Hello , Mr. Archer . Are you having any luck ? " " I think I 'm making some progress . How are you , Gloria ? " " I 'm all right . I guess you want to talk to Tom , do n't you ? " " It 's what I had in mind . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got off work last night , he was out on the streets driving around for hours . It was nearly dawn when he got home , and he was in poor shape . He was talking about death and destruction . " " Exactly what was he saying ? " " I would n't want to repeat it over the phone . You never know who 's listening these days . Anyway , it did n't make too much sense . " I decided I still had a client , and it was time I paid him another visit . Gloria answered the door . Her dark hair was damp and spread to dry on her shoulders , which she had protected with a thick towel . " You did n't say you were coming or I would n't have washed my hair . " " I decided I better talk to Tom in person . " " He 's still asleep . Do you want me to wake him up ? " " I 'll wake him . " I wanted an intimate look at Tom . Gloria showed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beauty 98old wooden Venetian blinds were closed , and Tom was snoring in the gloom . I opened the blinds , and the light sliced in , but it did n't disturb the sleeper . The back yard outside the window was a jungle of pittosporum dotted with red geraniums which had grown up through it toward the light . Tom was huddled like a fetus under a light blanket , one fist against his chest , the other under his cheek . The lower part of his face was peppered with beard . The pillow crushed under his head was the only one on the bed , and I could n't see any signs of lipstick stains . I looked around at Gloria . As if she could read my thoughts , she said from the doorway : " I have n't been sleeping with him , if that 's what you think . " Her voice was quite matter-of-fact . " Laurel 's the only girl he can see , and anyway I have a boy friend of my own . " " Where do you sleep ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too late to go home . Anyway , my boy friend has the car . " Tom groaned and turned onto his back , using his fists to shield his eyes from the light . I took him by the wrists and shook him a little . His half-awakened face was full of grief , and there were tears in the hollows of his eyes . He sobbed very loudly and pulled away from me . " I tried to make her warm again , " he said . " But she was cold . Mummy was cold . " Gloria said , " He 's having another bad spell . You just have to wait it out . " " Shut the door , will you please ? " She gave me an insulted look , but she did as I asked her to . I stayed with Tom . " What made Mummy cold ? " I said . " I pushed her and she fell down . " His voice seemed to mimic the voice of a child . " I did n't mean to make her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die her . But the back of her head was all sticky . " He peered at his clean pharmacist 's hands . " And she was cold . I could n't warm her up . " 99 " People do n't turn cold right away when they die , Tom . " " Mummy did . " He rocked his head from side to side . " She would n't let me get in bed with them . She said I had to stay in the room with the little girl . She got out of bed and said she was going to spank me . The man said do n't , just get him out of here , but she said spank . She spanked me and I pushed her and she fell down on the floor and I could n't wake her up even by singing . " " What did you sing ? " " Jingle Bells . ' The bed made a noise like Jingle Bells . She called him that sometimes , and then they laughed . " " What did he look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Old or young ? " " I do n't know . " " What kind of clothes was he wearing ? " " I do n't know . " Tom looked at me anxiously , clutching at the bedclothes as if the strata of time were shifting under him and might bury him . " He said he 'd come back and fix me if I told on him . " " He wo n't be coming back , Tom . That was a long time ago . " He heard me , and seemed to understand me . I waited for him to come out of his half-waking dream . New tears formed like protective lenses in his eyes . Gradually they cleared , and he recognized me . " Archer ? Is Laurel dead ? I dreamed that she was dead . " " That does n't make it so , Tom . As far as I know she 's alive . " " Where is she , then ? " His voice was still distraught . " Apparently she 's been kidnapped . " " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand made on her parents . And they 're prepared to pay it . But there 's some indication that it may be a phony and Laurel may be making a play for the money herself . Do you think that 's possible ? " " But Laurel has plenty of money . " Sleeping Beauty zoo " Her family has . She does n't get on too well with them . And I understand she took them for some money with a fake kidnappingwhen she was in her teens . " He regarded me with such loathing that it silenced me . His eyes narrowed down to dark slits , his lower lip pushed out . There were flecks of premature gray in his beard , like the first seeds of age beginning to sprout in him . He was just about young enough to be my son , and just about the age that I had been when I lost my wife . " I read your letter to Laurel , " I said . " Which one ? " " The one you sent to her grandmother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back of it . But I guess she never got around to sending it . " " What did she say ? " " The general idea was that she cared about you . I think she means to come back to you , if she can . " " I hope she does . " But he spoke without real hope . He sat on the bed with his legs dangling , like a man who had been invalided in combat with nightmares . I left him barely holding the ground he had won . Gloria was waiting in the narrow hallway . I could n't help wondering if she hoped to inherit Tom , or if it might happen without her consciously wishing it . And I asked myself if my own unconscious wish might be to inherit Laurel . We moved into the kitchen , where it had been easy to talk the night before . " What happened to Tom 's mother , Gloria ? " She clasped her upper arms in her fingers and hugged herself as if she could feel a chill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom gets very upset when anybody talks about it . " " He does n't have to know . " " You expect me to talk behind his back ? " she said unreasonably. 107 . " Tom hired me to work for him , which probably means he trusts me . " " Maybe he does . He trusts a lot of people . That does n't mean I should tell them the family secrets . " " I think you better tell me , though . It could have some bearingon what happened to Laurel . " " What did happen to Laurel ? " " I do n't know that either . Was Tom 's mother killed ? " " Yes , she was shot . " The young woman 's eyes were dark with feeling . " I do n't think Tom remembers except when he 's dreaming  --  he has these nightmares . " " Does he have them often ? " " I do n't know how often . I do n't spend that much time here . I think he gets them in cycles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sets him back . " " Like Laurel 's taking off ? " She nodded . " And there was another thing that probably got him started . My mother brought up the subject of the killing again . " In front of Tom ? " She nodded . " I could n't stop her . Mother gets pretty emotionalsometimes , and she still thinks if she could get Tom to remember the shooting , really remember it , she might find out who did it . She has n't given up hope of finding the murderer , even after all these years . " " How many years ? " " Over twenty-five . It happened when I was just a tiny baby . " " Why did n't you tell me about this last night ? " " I could n't . We do n't even talk about it in the family , let alone outside the family . " " Who shot her ? " " Nobody knows . The killer was never brought to justice , anyway . I do n't know why I 'm telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard me . " She caught her breath . " I do n't really mean that . Mother would n't hurt anybody , let alone me . Sleeping Beauty 102She 's her own worst enemy . She would n't hurt a hair on anyone'shead . " Gloria stroked her damp hair absently . " What was her relation to Tom 's mother ? " " They were sisters , almost the same age , and very close at one time . I used to wonder why Mother was always so sad , until I found out she had a reason . " " Would she discuss it with me , do you think ? " " I doubt it . I certainly would n't want to ask her . " " Where is your mother ? " " I 'm not going to tell you . " There was a sudden note of obstinacy in her voice which made me wonder what she was covering up . " Are n't you interested in what happened to your aunt ? What was her name ? " " Aunt Allie . Alison Russo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to put my mother through it again . She has enough on her mind . " " So has Tom , " I said . " It might be a way of getting it off both their minds . " She shook her head . " It would n't work that way . I said the same thing to my boy friend when he got gung ho on the subject . In our family , the only way to do is let things lie , keep things quiet . " " You ca n't , though . Look at Tom . He 's having nightmares about his mother 's death . " " It 's better than daymares . " " How do you know ? " " I 've tried them both , " she said . " Has Tom ever talked to a psychiatrist ? " " Of course not . There 's nothing the matter with his head . " I looked at my watch . The morning was wasting , and I was due back in Seahorse Lane at noon . I thanked Gloria and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hope there 's no hard feelings because I would n't tell you certain things . " 103 " No hard feelings , " I said . " Take care of Tom . " I was out of the house before I realized that I had n't asked him to pay me anything more . Perhaps I did n't want to take his money . XVIIITopanga Court , where Martha Mungan lived , was a long step down from the Excalibur Arms . It was a collection of peeling stucco buildings huddled between the Pacific Coast Highway and the eroding cliff . An earth slide leaned against the cliff like sand in the bottom of an hourglass which had almost run out . I parked in front of the central building . A sign offered family accommodations by the day or week , some with kitchen . A bell jingled over the door when I opened it . Behind the archway which contained the desk there were television voices in a darkened room . A woman called out : " Who is that ? " An empty registration card lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lew Archer , thief catcher , corpse finder , ear to anyone . I said : " Do you know Joseph Sperling ? " " Joe ? You bet I do . How are you , Joe ? " I did n't answer her . I stood and listened to her slow footsteps as they approached the archway . Her face was closed and blind as she came through , a middle-aged woman wearing a harsh red wig and a kimono spilling colors down her front . She blinked against the light like a nocturnal animal . Sleeping Beauty 104 " You 're not Joe Sperling . Who are you trying to kid ? " " I did n't say I was . " I gave her my name . " Joe and I had a little talk this morning . " " How is Joe , anyway ? I have n't seen him in years . " " He seems to be all right . But I guess he 's getting older . " " Are n't we all ? " Her eyes came up to mine , surprisingly bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a talk with Joe . Aboutme ? " " About you and your husband . " A sluggish ripple of alarm moved across her face , leaving wrinkles behind it . " I do n't have a husband  --  not any more . " She took a deep sighing breath . " Is Ralph Mungan in some kind of trouble ? " " He may be . " " I 've been wondering . He dropped out of sight so completely , it made me wonder if he 's in jail or something . " " Something , " I said , to keep her interest alive . A loose and empty smile took over the lower half of her face . She let it talk for her while her experienced eyes studied me . " Would you be a copsie-wopsie by any chancie-wancie ? " " A private one . " " And you want some info on Ralph ? " I nodded . In the shadow world behind the archway , the daytimetelevision voices were telling their obvious secrets . I 'd love you but I have a fractured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you back but you resemble my father , who treated me rotten . " Where is Ralph ? " " I do n't know , " I lied . " What do you want him for ? " " Nothing very important . At least , I hope it is n't important . " She leaned across the counter , resting the burden of her breast on it . " Do n't play games with me , eh ? I want to know what it 's all about . And what does Joe Sperling have to do with it ? " 105 " Remember a tweed suit Joe made for Ralph 's birthday one year ? " Her eyes sharpened . " That was a long time ago . What about the suit ? " " It turned up in the ocean this morning . " " So ? It was just an old suit . " " Have you seen it lately , Mrs. Mungan ? " " I do n't know . After Ralph left , I threw out most of his things . I 've moved a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was wearing it ? " With her fingers clenched on the edge of the counter , she pushed herself upright . Something that looked like a wedding band was sunk in the flesh of the appropriate finger like a deep scar . " Somebody was wearing it ? " she said . " A little old man with burn marks on his head and face . Do you know him , Mrs. Mungan ? " Her face went blank , as if the impact of my question had knocked all sentience from her head . " I do n't know who it could be , " she said without force . " Did you say the tweed suit was in the ocean ? " " That 's right . I found it myself . " " Right off here ? " She gestured across the Coast Highway . " A few miles south of here , off Pacific Point . " She was silent , while slow thought worked at her face . " What about the man ? " she said finally . " The man ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were just telling me about . " " What about him ? " " Is he all right ? " " Why ? " I said . " Do you know him ? " " I would n't say I know him . But I may have given him that suit . " " When ? " Sleeping Beauty io6 " Answer my question first , " she said sharply . " Is he all right ? " " I 'm afraid not . He was in the suit when I found it in the water . And he was dead . " I was watching her face for signs of shock or grief , or possibly remorse . But it seemed empty of feeling . Her eyes were the color of the low city skies under which she had moved a lot . " How did you happen to give him the suit ? " I said . She was slow in answering . " I do n't remember too well . I do quite a lot of drinking , if you want the truth , and it washes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He came to the door one day when I was slightly plastered . He was just an old bum , practically in rags . I wanted to give him something to keep him warm , and that old suit of Ralph Mungan 's was all I had . " I studied her face , trying to decide among three main possibilities : either she was leveling , or she was one of those natural liars who lied more convincingly than they told the truth , or her story had been carefully prepared . " He came here , did he , Mrs. Mungan ? " " That 's right . He was standing where you 're standing now . " " Where did he come from ? " " He did n't say . I guess he was working his way along the beach . The last I saw of him , he was heading south . " " How long ago was this ? " " I do n't even remember . " " You must have some idea , though . " " A couple of weeks , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him ? A broad-shouldered man of thirty or so , about my height ? " " I did n't see any younger man . " But her look was defensive , and her voice had a whine in it . " Why are you asking me all these questions ? I was just being a good Samaritan to him . You ca n't blame a woman for being a good Samaritan . " " But you did n't remember about it at first . You thought you threw the suit out with Ralph Mungan 's other things . And then you remembered that you gave it to the dead man . " 107 " That 's just the way my mind works . Anyway , he was n't dead when I gave it to him . " " He 's dead now . " " I know that . " We faced each other across the counter . Behind her in the darkened room , the shadow voices went on telling the city 's parables : Daddy was n't the only one who treated me rotten . I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fractured part . The woman was long past her prime , her mind leached out by drinking , her body swollen . But I rather liked her . I did n't think she was capable of murder . No doubt she was capable of covering for it , though , if she had a guilty lover or a son . I left , intending to pay her another visit . XIX-Go- GJ4 4fiyIt was nearly noon when I got back to Pacific Point . The harbor was even blacker than it had been in the morning . Men wearing oilskins and hip boots were cleaning its rock walls with live steam . Other workers in small skiffs were scattering straw on the floating oil , then picking up the oil-soaked straw with pitchforks . Hundreds of bales of fresh straw had been trucked in from somewhere and were piled on the beach like barriers against a possible invasion . There were further changes on the wharf . A couple of dozen picketers were walking back and forth across its entrance . They carried homemade signs : " Do Not Patronize : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " Pollution ! " Most of the picketers were middleaged , though there were several long-haired youths among them . I recognized the hairy-faced young fisherman I had talked to the previous evening . He shook his sign at me  --  " Consider the Poor Fish "  --  and yelled good-naturedly as I drove past him onto the wharf . Blanche was watching the picketers from the almost empty parking lot of her restaurant . She recognized me as a customer and raised her voice in complaint . " They 're trying to put me out of business . I want to know , did they use any force on you ? Or threaten you ? " " No , they did n't . " " Too bad . " She shook her frizzy head . " The police said unless they use force or threats it 's legal and there 's nothing I can do . But it does n't look legal to me . I 'd like to toss ' em over the railing and give ' em a little taste of that oily water . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wharf . " " Is it really your wharf ? " " It is to all intents and purposes . I 've got it on long-term lease , and it gives me the right to rent space to the oil company . I intend to make a personal appeal to the Governor . " Blanche was flushed and breathing hard . She ran out of breath . " I had dinner in your restaurant last night . " " Sure , I remember . You did n't finish your red snapper . I hope it was all right . " " It was fine . I was n't too hungry . I noticed a couple of other customers while I was here  --  an older man with a young one . The old man was wearing a tweed suit , and he had burn scars on his head  --  " " I remember them . What about them ? " " I 'd like to get in touch with them . Do you have any idea where they belong ? " She shook her head . " I never saw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 109 " How do you know ? " " They asked me for directions . They wanted to know how to get to Seahorse Lane . " She pointed south along the beach in the direction of Sylvia Lennox 's house . " Did they say who they wanted to visit on Seahorse Lane ? " " No , but I wondered at the time . It 's a very high-priced development , right on the beach . And they were strictly from hunger  --  at least the old one was . I mean literally . You should have seen him eat . " I thanked her and started back to my car . A gray-haired man climbed out of another car and casually intercepted me . He had sensitive blue eyes which wore , like a transparent shield , the detachment of an observer . " You 're not a local man , are you ? " he said to me . " No . It 's a free country . " His face wrinkled in a self-deprecating smile which was almost a look of pain . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Lennox Oil ? " " No . I 'm a free lance . " " Exactly what does that mean ? " He was still smiling . " I 'm a private investigator . My name is Archer . " " Mine is Wilbur Cox . I write for the local paper . What crime are you investigating , Mr. Archer ? The crime of pollution ? " " I 'd certainly like to know what caused this oil spill . " He seemed happy to oblige . " The oil people say it was an act of God , and in the long run there 's some truth in that . The underseaformations here are naturally porous , delicate to fool with . You might say the area is blowout-prone . But in the short run the oil people are to blame . They did n't take the danger of a spill fully into account , and they did n't use the right preventive measures for drilling at this depth . The result is what you see . " He flung out his arm toward the platform which stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right preventive measures ? " " It costs money , " he said . " Oilmen are gamblers , most of them , and they 'd rather take a little chance than spend a lot of money . Sleeping Beauty iioOr wait for technology to catch up . " He added after a moment , " They 're not the only gamblers . We 're all in the game . We all drive cars , and we 're all hooked on oil . The question is how we can get unhooked before we drown in the stuff . " I nodded in agreement and started to move away toward my car . He drifted after me : " Are you the man who pulled a body out of the water this morning ? " I said I was . " Can you identify the victim ? " " Not yet . I 'm working on it . " " Do you want to give me a quote ? " " I 'm afraid I ca n't , Mr. Cox . Any publicity would interfere with my investigation . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detachment , the newsman 's eyes burned cold . " I honestly do n't know . I 'll see you later . " I did n't get far . The entrance to the wharf was blocked by a line of picketers facing landward . Beyond them was a big semitrailerloaded with tanks of drilling mud . The driver glared down at the picketers from his high seat and inched the truck forward . One of the young sign carriers sat down in front of the wheels . His face was pale and scared , as if he knew what a poor brake his body was to the heavy movements of the world . But he sat without moving as the double wheels turned almost on top of him . The driver spat an inaudible word and slammed on his brakes . He climbed down out of the cab , swinging a tire iron in his hand . I got out of my car at the same time and pushed through the line of picketers to face him . He was a flat-nosed young man with angry eyes . " Get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a delivery . " " Sorry , we do n't need a tire iron . " " You look as if you need one , right across the face . " " It would n't be a good idea , " I said . " Put it down , eh ? " 111 " When you get out of the way . I 'm on legitimate business . " " You do n't look so legitimate with that thing in your hand . " The driver glanced down at his weapon with some surprise . Perhaps he recognized that he was a threatening figure , and that he was a minority of one . The picketers were beginning to move around me . The driver climbed back into the cab of his truck and sat there glaring . Thirty or forty feet ahead of him , the newsman Wilbur Cox was leaning on the railing and taking notes . At the outer end of the wharf , beyond Blanche 's Restaurant , a large black car appeared and moved slowly toward us . It stopped just behind my car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved like the Captain 's shadow . Both men looked rather haggard , as if they had had a rough morning . It was threatening to get rougher . The picketers surged around the car , forcing the two men back against its side . Somerville looked grim . His companion was pale and frightened . " Stand back , " he said in an uncertain voice . " This is Captain Somerville . He 's the executive v.p. of Lennox Oil . " " We know that , " the young fisherman said . " When are you going to cap the oil spill , Cap ? " Somerville answered : " As soon as we possibly can . We made an attempt this morning . I 'm sorry to say it did n't succeed . We have to stockpile more drilling mud , and bring in some experts , and we 'll make another attempt by the end of the week . In the meantime I 'm asking you for your patience and cooperation . " The picketers groaned . One of them called out : " When are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't need it . " " The platform is there legally , " Somerville said in an unbendingtone , " with the approval of the U.S. Geological Survey . And when you stop our deliveries  --  which is what you 're doing now  --  you 're interfering with our attempts to stop the spill . " The crowd began to get noisier , its groan deteriorating into a growl . The driver sitting up in the cab of the truck had a restlessSleeping Beauty 112ook in his eye . I decided I had better make a move before he lid . I inched through the crowd to Somerville . " You better get iut of here , Captain . Get back in the car and follow my car , eh ? " Somerville . and his aide climbed into the front seat , the whiteacedyounger man behind the wheel . I said to the picketers : " Let them move out . Nobody wants any trouble . " " That 's right , " a middle-aged woman said . " We do n't want rouble . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a young man said . I said ; " It 's better than blood . " The crowd made assenting noises . They moved back slowly , sway from Somerville 's car . I got into mine , eased it past the emitrailer , and turned toward Seahorse Lane , with Somerville ) ehind me . I was sweating with relief . Twice in no more than ten minutes , he threat of violence in the air had come very near to being actualized . There were sirens in the distance like the sound of a further threat . XX-444 P44Several cars were already parked under the cypresses in ylvia Lennox 's courtyard . Captain Somerville 's car pulled up ) ehind mine . He got out and shook my hand , quite heartily , : hough his eyes were looking past me . " I have to thank you for your intervention . This is Leroy Willis , of our public-relations department . Let 's see , your name s Archer , is n't it ? " 113The younger man climbed out from behind the wheel and gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was close to my age  --  but was one of those middle-aging men who have never lost the mannerisms of youth . His eyes were damp and emotional . He smelled as if he had somehow managed to get hold of some whisky . " Leroy 's an old shipmate of mine . " Somerville spoke with rather forced nostalgia . " He was with me at Okinawa . Today was the most excitement we 've had since , was n't it , Leroy ? " Leroy said that it was . He seemed upset . and embarrassed , and I got the impression that the Captain , with a kind of affectionate sadism , was subtly needling him . The two men went inside , Leroy trailing behind . I waited a moment , listening to the pigeons talking in the cypresses . Tony Lashman appeared beside the garages . His face was pale and intent , and he moved like a man with a grievance . He gestured toward the house . " What 's going on in there ? " " I was going to ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of their family conferences . I 'm supposed to be Mrs. Lennox 's confidential secretary , but she told me to stay out . Are they letting you in ? " " I hope so . " I started toward the house , but Lashman stepped in front of me . He was beginning to turn into a nuisance . " Look , " he said . " I want to know what goes on in there . If you can give me the info , I 'll pay you for it . " " How much ? " " I do n't know how much . But it could be quite a lot  --  a lot more than a hundred dollars a day . " " And where would the money come from ? " He saw that I was trying to pump him , and it made him angry : " All right . I 'll handle it myself . " He turned on his heel and walked away from me . Emerson Little , the lawyer , was waiting for me at the door . Sleeping Beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes and an undertaker 's exaggerated poise . He gave me a soft hand and a hard look . " You 're a bit late , Mr. Archer . " " I know that . I 'm sorry . " " I had quite a time holding Jack Lennox in place . He 's a headstrong man . " " Where is he ? " " Inside with his mother . Sylvia Lennox is my client . She would n't release the hundred thousand until you got here , and I supported her in that . The essential point of this operation is to get her granddaughter back safely . The money is quite secondary . Still , we do n't want it wasted on a wild-goose chase . " " What form is the money in ? " " Unmarked twenties in a plain cardboard carton , as re-quested . " " And where 's the drop ? " " Jack Lennox wo n't divulge that . " Little 's bland face was moved by a spasm of irritation . " Well . We have to do our best with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the front room . Sylvia was there with her family . Captain Somerville sat by Elizabeth , his eyes distracted and remote . Elizabeth gave me a faint smile . Jack Lennox refused to look at me , and his wife Marian looked at me without appearing to see me . There were spatterings of oil on the windows . A brown cardboard box on the floor beside Sylvia 's chair drew attention like a ticking bomb . The old woman lifted her hand . " Come and sit down beside me for a minute , Mr. Archer . " Lennox said , " We 're wasting time , Mother . " " Please try to be patient , Jack . " She turned to me . " My husband  --  my ex-husband wants to see you and Jack in El Rancho after you 've delivered the money . I 'm afraid I needed115some help from him in raising it this morning . It gives William an interest in it , and he is n't one to let such an interest go un-used . " " It 's a natural interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his only grandchild . " Somerville turned and looked at Elizabeth as if perhaps she was criticizing his potency . " I 'm not suggesting that William 's interest in Laurel is unnatural , " Sylvia said dryly . " I 'm sure he has his hands full with that young woman of his . And I 'm afraid this business wo n't improve his feelings toward the rest of us . It 's too bad he had to find out about it . " " It does n't really matter , " Marian Lennox said . " What matters is getting my daughter back . Everything else is unimportant . " Her tormented gaze moved around the room as if daring anyone to contradict her . " I quite agree , " Emerson Little said . Jack Lennox rose half out of his chair . " Then why do n't we get moving ? " It was a nervous meeting , buzzing with unspoken thoughts . Before it broke up , I asked Sylvia Lennox if she had seen the man in the tweed suit or his companion the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not sure they were here . But if they were , it was probably around eight last night . " " I was out for dinner . Perhaps Tony Lashman saw them . You 'll probably find him sulking in his room . " " Sulking ? " " I had to put him in his place . He 's becoming much too inquisitiveabout my affairs . " She gave me a bright look . " You 're rather inquisitive yourself , are n't you ? " I did n't have to answer her . Jack Lennox stood up and looked at his watch dramatically : " Let 's get this show on the road , shall we ? " He was wearing a brown suede jacket , and the gun in hisSleeping Beauty 116side pocket was obvious . He turned and strode out toward the courtyard . I followed him , carrying the box of money . The man in the tweed suit would have to wait . " We 'll take my car , " Lennox said . " It has a telephone in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do the driving . " " All right . " He said impatiently , " I was n't asking your permission , I was stating my intention . I 'd prefer to go alone . But for some reason my mother insists that I take you along . Against my wishes . Is that clear ? " Under his impatience I could sense his deep fatigue . I was determined to go along with him . " You make it very clear . " I put the money on the seat between us . Lennox drove out of the courtyard on whining tires which seemed intended to let his family know that nobody cared as much as he did . I did n't speak until we were on the old highway heading south . " Where are we going , Mr. Lennox ? " " Sandhill Lake . It 's between the Point and El Rancho . " " Is n't there a hunting club on the lake ? " " There used to be . My father was one of the members in the old days . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's where I learned to shoot . " " Who picked Sandhill Lake ? " After another silence , he said , " I do n't understand your ques-tion . " " Did you or the kidnapper pick Sandhill Lake for the money drop ? " " He did , of course . " " That 's quite a coincidence , is n't it ? " " Where 's the coincidence ? " He sounded genuinely puzzled . I wondered how much drinkinghe had done in the course of the night , and how little sleeping . I said : " That he should pick a place you know . A club your father belonged to . " He answered after a while . " I see what you mean . " 117 " It suggests he knows your family . " Or at least knows Laurel , I thought . " I take it you talked to him on the phone yourself . " " When ? " " Last night . " " Yes . I did . " " Did you know him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He gave me an angry questioning look , and the black Cadillac swerved onto the shoulder . Lennox pulled it back onto the road without slackening speed . We were going about eighty . I did n't quite dare to answer him directly , that I suspected his daughter of conning him and the rest of the family . He had some of Laurel 's wildness in him  --  or she had some of his  --  and he was capable of going into a blank rage and wrecking the car . " I 'm only speculating , trying to get a lead on the people involved . " " There 's only the one , so far as I know . " " A man ? " " That 's right . " " But you did n't recognize his voice on the phone ? " " No , I did not . And while we 're on the subject , I do n't give a damn about nailing him , is that clear ? It is n't my money , anyway . It belongs to my father and mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to need . " " I realize the money is n't important . " " I 'm glad you do , " he said . " At least we 've got that straight . " " But even after the money is delivered , there 's still the question of getting Laurel back . Did he give you any idea of where she is ? " " Of course not . But there 's no problem . He gets the money , we get Laurel . " " What if you do n't get her ? " " We will , , though , " he said . " I 'm sure of it . " " Do you think he 's got Laurel with him at Sandhill Lake ? " He turned on me , his face suffused with blood . " How the hell do I know ? " The Cadillac had wandered out of its lane again , Sleeping Beauty 118as Lennox 's attention swerved to me . I took hold of the wheel with both hands , found the brake with my foot , and brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highway . " What do you think you 're trying to do ? " he said . " Not get killed . " " Then get out and walk . " " My orders are to go along with you . " " I 'm changing the orders . Get out . " I went on sitting where I was , beside the money . Lennox thrust his hand into his jacket pocket and pointed the pocket at me . " Out , " he said . I did n't think he 'd shoot me deliberately . But he seemed accident-prone , and his hand was hidden . All I needed was a bullet in the kidneys . I opened the door and climbed out and watched him drive away . Then I followed along on foot . The Cadillac climbed a long rise and disappeared over its crest . There were few cars on the old highway , and none of them stopped to pick me up . But it was a clear bright day , and I felt a certain pleasure in being alone and on foot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the top of the rise . Beyond it was a series of dunes which marched in giant rhythm along the shore . Sandhill Lake lay on their landward side , an irregular oval which looked like a spattering of sky . On its near side I could see the green buildings of the hunting club , with Lennox 's black Cadillac parked beside them . Farther away , at the end of the lake , was a wooden lookout tower with gray shingled sides . A dirt road ran from the main buildings to the tower . Jack Lennox was walking away from me along the dirt road , carrying the carton of money in his hands . He reached the tower and went inside . I heard a muffled explosion , and then another . Ducks rose from the lake , pintails and shovelers . They moved like visible echoes in wide expanding circles . Lennox came119out empty-handed and ran along the road and fell down and crawled and lay still . Another man emerged from the tower , carrying the brown carton of money in his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other direction and began to run , limping , toward a eucalyptus grove that stood between the tower and the highway . He moved like a young man , in spite of his limp , and he could have been the one I had seen at Blanche 's with the man in the tweed suit . He was too far away for me to be sure . I started to run down the highway , regretting the fact that I had no gun with me , and no binoculars . It was a long run . Before I reached the foot of the hill , the ducks had circled out over the sea and were coming back and dropping down to the lake again . As if to preserve some kind of natural balance which required live things to be in the air at all times , a flock of band-tailed pigeons exploded out of the eucalyptus grove . Then a small green car shot out of its far end and turned down the highway away from me . It was too far away for me to catch the license number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XXILennox was lying where he had fallen , unconscious but breathing . A .32 revolver was clenched in his hand , and its muzzle smelled as though it had been recently fired . A bullet had grooved the side of his head and snipped off the upper tipSleeping Beauty 120of his left ear . It did n't look like a fatal wound , but thick worms of blood ran down from it and coiled in the dust . I tied a handkerchief around his head to staunch the flow of blood . Then I left him where he lay and used the phone in his car to call an ambulance and the Sheriff 's men . I went back and waited with Lennox . But a funny irrational feeling grew on me that the lookout tower was watching us . I went to the half-open door and looked in . There was nothing inside but a drift of sand marked with footprints . A dilapidated ladder went up to the observation platform . I did n't climb the ladder , or even go in . There might be fingerprintson the rungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , the feeling of being watched had been dispelled . I leaned in the sun against the outside wall and watched the ducks fly up again when the ambulance and the Sheriff 's radio car arrived together . They strapped Lennox onto a stretcher and took him away . Two Sheriff 's officers remained with me , and I told them how Lennox had put me out on the road , and what I had seen and heard from the hilltop . The officers ' names were Dolan and Shantz . Dolan was a straight-backed captain with a clipped gray mustache and probingeyes . Shantz was a heavy-shouldered young sergeant who looked like a football player going to seed . Captain Dolan picked up Lennox 's revolver and spun the chamber . Only one shot had been fired from it . He let me see that , but made no comment . The three of us walked along a dirt lane toward the eucalyptus grove , avoiding the footprints left by the running man . Dolan bent over to examine one of the footprints . " He was losing blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe his shoe filled up with it and slopped over . " He turned to Shantz and me . " Take a look for yourselves . " We leaned over beside him . There was a paste of blood and sand in the footprint , and more in the footprints farther on. 121 " You did say you heard two shots , did n't you ? " Dolan looked at me as if there might be some hope for me , after all . " It looks like a double shooting that we have here . " " I think it was . Each man shot the other . " Following the bloody footprints , we walked in under the graygreeneucalyptus trees . The pigeons had n't come back , but there were warblers busy in the treetops . I caught myself wishing that we could live like the birds and move through nature without hurting it or ourselves . A pool of blood stood beside the deep tracks where the car had stood . I described the Falcon , and what I had seen of the man who had driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too bad you did n't get his license number , " Dolan said . " We better get the mobile lab out here and take some casts , and check the tower for prints . You want to call ' em , Shantzie ? " The younger man went back along the lane . Dolan leaned on a peeling eucalyptus trunk and folded his arms . His eyes were bleak and intent , and they looked at me like the eyes of a rifleman getting ready to fire . " This is an important case , you know , " he said quietly . " A double shooting , for starters . And then it 's got the Lennox name in it . They 've been all over the newspapers the last few days , and this will blow the headlines even bigger . It could make and break some reputations in this county . Including mine , " he added . " Let 's face it . " " It 's important , all right . " " You know it is . You know it better than I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to let down your inhibitions and tell me what it 's all about ? " " I wish I knew . " " Do n't give me that . I wish I knew what you know . This morning you pulled a body out of the water in front of Mrs. William Lennox 's beach house . Six or seven hours later , you turn up here at the scene of another crime . How do you account for that ? " Sleeping Beauty 122 " Just lucky , I guess . " Dolan frowned and bit his mustache . " I want a serious answer . Did you know that this shooting , or these shootings , were going to happen ? " " Certainly not . " " Okay , what brought you here ? " " Jack Lennox came here on private business . His family asked me to accompany him . " " Private business with the man who shot him ? " " I think so . " " What was the nature of the business ? " I would have liked to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved , I had to try to protect her . Even if she was an innocent victim , it would n't do her any good to blow the case wide open at this point . " I ca n't tell you that , " I said . " You mean you ca n't or you wo n't ? " " I 'd have to take it up with the Lennox family first . " " Maybe you better do that as soon as possible . " Dolan lookeddown at the ground between us . " It would n't be a blackmailpayment , by any chance ? " No . " It does n't have anything to do with that body you hauled out of the sea this morning ? " " It may . I do n't know what the connection is . " " Then how do you know there is one ? " " I do n't . But I saw two men together last night at Blanche 's on the wharf . One of them was the little man I pulled out of the water this morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating off Sylvia Lennox 's beach . " " That could be , " Dolan said . " He was in the water for eight or ten hours , and there 's a southward current that probably brought him from the direction of town . You say you saw him with another man on the wharf ? " " In Blanche 's Restaurant , last night about seven o'clock . The123other man was young , about thirty or so . Medium to tall in height , exceptionally broad shoulders . Dark hair and eyes . Dark turtleneck sweater . " Dolan stepped away from his tree . " Sounds like the man who drove away in the Falcon  --  the one with the blood in his shoe . " " I think it was . " XXIIThe keys were in Jack Lennox 's Cadillac , and I took it . Instead of turning north toward Pacific Point , I went south to El Rancho , where his father lived . Since I had last seen the place , an electronic gate had been installed at the entrance . The armed guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phoned William Lennox at his house . He came out of his kiosk wearing a respectful expression . " It 's okay , Mr. Archer . Mr. Lennox says you can come right out . Know where to find his place ? " " I 'm afraid I do n't . " He showed me a large-scale map attached to the wall of his office . " Turn left at the far end of the golf course . That will take you past River Valley School . Then turn sharp right up the hill , and you 'll see Mr. Lennox 's mailbox at the top . " I followed his directions , paying special attention to River Valley School . It was a scattering of weathered redwood buildingsdwarfed by the great native oak trees that surrounded it . Though I 'd never been inside it , the school had associations for me . Both Laurel and Elizabeth had been students there . ISleeping Beauty 124wondered what it had been like to grow up in the protective shadow of those trees . William Lennox 's mailbox was made of stone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean in both directions as far as I could see . In the fields beyond it , on either side of the lane that led to the house , there were horses grazing . They looked like racing stock , and one of them , a sorrel mare , was running in irregular circles , apparently for the fun of it . She came to an uncertain stop near the wall , about a hundred feet from me . Then I noticed the woman standing inside the wall . She was wearing a riding costume topped off with a Mexican hat , and held a long-handled whip upright in her hand . She flicked it harmlessly in the air . The mare started off on another circuit , arching her neck and swinging her head like a hammer from side to side . I got out and approached the woman . " Nice-looking horse . " She regarded me coolly over the stone wall . " She is n't bad . " She was a nice-looking woman , probably in her early forties , but holding hard to what she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a wide Western belt , looked as if I could span it with my two hands . Her dark eyes looked at me as if that might be a dangerous thing to try . " My name is Archer . I 'd like to see Mr. Lennox . " Her voice sharpened . " Is he expecting you ? " " Yes . " " Are you the detective ? " I said I was . She looked along the fence at the Cadillac . " Is that Jack Lennox 's car ? " " Yes . " " What happened to him ? " " He got shot . " " Fatally ? " " I do n't know . I doubt it . " 125She looked at me so impassively that I could n't tell if she was disappointed or relieved . Her eyes softened as the mare came running up to her , hoofs drumming . The woman leaned her whip against the wall and stroked the mare on the nose , then sent her trotting away into the field . The woman turned back to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " Her eyes hardened . " You do n't have to answer me in monosyllables . I 'm Mrs. Hapgood , and I have a serious interest in what 's happened . I 'm trying to protect my hus  --  Mr. Lennox . " " Your husband ? " " That was a slip of the tongue , " she said . " We 're not married yet . But I take my responsibility seriously . Believe it or not , I 'm trying to keep this family together . " " Why ? " " Because William wants it that way , " she said . " So what happened to Jack ? " I told her over the stone wall as we walked back toward the car . She climbed on a stile into the lane and got into the front seat beside me . " Jack 's always been wild and impulsive . He should n't have been the one to go . " " I know that . But he was determined . And Laurel 's his daugh-ter . " " Is she not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ? " " A very long time indeed , yes . But please do n't try to interrogateme . " " I was n't . " " Were n't you ? I think you were . But I 'm not your problem , or any part of it . " " Then maybe you 're part of the solution . " She gave me a flashing smile , like a knife gleaming briefly from concealment . " As a matter of fact , I think I am . Let 's getSleeping Beauty 126one thing straight . I love William Lennox . That 's more than you can say for the members of his family  --  certainly more than you can say for his wife . " I drove down the long lane , which was almost blocked at one point by a bulldozer pulled to the side . I maneuvered the Cadillac around it . The house stood on a rise above the beach . It was two-storied , white with a red tiled roof , and it stretched out for a hundred feet on either side of the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a medieval castle , with highbackedchairs and massive tables and couches too large for ordinary human use . She left me there and went to find Lennox . I stood by one of the great windows and looked out over the ocean . It was a clear day and I could see , almost halfway to the horizon , a flight of shearwaters like a scrap of dark chiffon blowingalong the blue surface . Off to the north , the color seemed to change from blue to brownish , and the sea seemed flat and inert . The oil slick was moving south with the current from Pacific Point . William Lennox and Mrs. Hapgood came into the room . They were n't touching , or even close , but they seemed to be very conscious of each other . They moved together with a certain pride . Lennox was n't a big man like his son , but he was one you would notice anywhere . He was wearing a white shirt with a green stone at the throat . He walked upright , with his white head held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstretchedto greet me . His hand was thin and frail , scrolled with enormous blue veins . His eyes peered at me from their wrinkles like blue lights shining through a screen . " Mr. Archer ? How are you ? " His handshake was firm . " Can I get you a drink ? " " Not when I 'm working , thank you . " " You 're very austere , " the woman said dryly. 127The old man cleared his throat . " Connie tells me that my son has been shot . Is it bad ? " " A bullet creased him just above the ear . It did n't look as if it penetrated the skull . I called an ambulance right away , and they took him back to the hospital in Pacific Point . The other man was shot , too , but he got away with the money . " " Jack shot him ? " " In the leg , apparently . " ! " Where were you when it happened ? " His voice was quiet and even , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " About half a mile up the road . " I explained why . Lennox 's face reddened slightly , and then grew pale . " The whole thing 's been bungled . I 'm not blaming you , Mr. Archer . I blame my wife and that stupid lawyer of hers . I should have gone there myself . " " And been shot ? " Connie Hapgood said . " I would have shot first . I would have blown his head off . " The woman touched his arm , reminding him that he was getting excited . He took a deep breath and turned away . He walked to the end of the room , stood facing the wall for a moment , and then came back . " Have the F.B.I . been called in ? " " No . " " Why not ? What 's Sylvia doing ? " " Trying to protect your granddaughter , I believe . " " This is a hell of a way to protect her . " He gave me a hot and narrow look . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of keeping them out , yes . I still have n't told the whole story to the police . " " Why not ? " " Do n't get excited , William , " the woman said . " Why do n't we all sit down and relax a bit ? " " I prefer to stand . " He turned to me . " I do n't understand your purpose in concealing evidence from the police and the F.B.I . " Sleeping Beauty 128 " You may not want to hear my reason . " " On the contrary , I insist on hearing it . " " Whatever you say . Do you want me to talk in front of Mrs. Hapgood ? " " Yes . Quit stalling , man . " " This may not be a kidnapping in the ordinary sense . It does n't feel like a kidnapping to me . " " What in hell does it feel like ? " " I ca n't say . But I found out last night that Laurel has been involved in a similar case before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to Las Vegas with a boy . The two of them asked Laurel 's parents for ransom money  --  a thousand dollars , I believe . And apparently they collected . " He squinted at me from a network of wrinkles . " I knew that she 'd run off that time , of course . But Jack never told me about the money angle . " " He would n't , " Connie Hapgood said . " He was n't going to tell you this time either . But Sylvia could n't raise the hundred thousand , so you had to be told . " He shook his head as if her words were insects attacking him . " I do n't believe that Laurel would do such a thing . She is n't a cheat . And if she needed money , she could have come to me directly . " " She 's afraid of you , " the woman said . " She always has been , since she was a girl in school . And remember it is n't the first time she 's played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe it . " He turned to me again . His shoulders were visibly bowed now and his arms were hanging loose , as if he 'd lost the principle that kept him controlled and upright . " I know that Laurel has had her emotional problems . But she would n't lie to me , or cheat her own family . She simply is n't that kind of a girl . " He seemed close to breaking down and crying ; then his grief changed back to anger . " Damn it to hell , if she did do it , somebody put her up to it . If it was that hus-129band of hers , I 'll blow his head off . What 's his name ? Russo ? " " It was n't Tom Russo . " But even as I said that , I realized that I could n't be quite sure . Tom had his problems , too ; death haunted his dreams and perhaps his waking life . The woman was watching Lennox with sharp attention . She may have realized that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , she had inadvertently driven it into him . She moved toward him and put her arm around him . " It 's time you took a rest , William . You 've had too much for one day . " " I ca n't rest . Who will look after things ? " He spoke with an old man 's querulousness . " Everything 's going to pieces . Jack is shot and Laurel 's missing and our new well blew out . And Sylvia sits up there and laughs about it . Damn Sylvia to hell . And damn Ben Somerville . Why did I have to surround myself with losers ? " The woman led him out of the room by the hand . As she passed me , she gave me a keen promising look which made me wait for her to come back . She was gone for some time . When she returned , she had changed her riding costume for a dress and was carrying a book in her hand . " I gave him a tranquilizer , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very hard on William . He lives in dreams , he always has . He came out here after the first war withSleeping Beauty 130the dream of founding an empire and a dynasty . All he had to start with was a few thousand dollars which he 'd saved and some experience in the Pennsylvania oil fields . And he made the dream come true . " Her eyes swept the room , which looked very much like a dream that had solidified around the dreamer . " Now it 's breaking up around him , and he ca n't stand it . " " You put it to him pretty strongly about Laurel . " " I have to , or he 'll go on dreaming about her . Men are so unrealistic where women are concerned . It 's been obvious for at least fifteen years that Laurel Lennox is a schizoid personality . But her family go on treating her as if she were perfectly normal , and being surprised and dumfounded when she turns out not to be . " " Are you a psychiatrist ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But she gave me a look which conveyed the idea that where Laurel was concerned I was just another dreaming man . " I have studied some psychology , and I know Laurel . " " You 've known her for fifteen years ? " " Longer than that . I started teaching at River Valley School eighteen years ago . I 've known Laurel since she was eleven or twelve . And she 's always lived in a world of her own , a not very happy world where not very nice things happen . " " That 's true of a lot of children . Ordinarily , though , we do n't blame them . " " I 'm not blaming her , for heaven 's sake . I 'm trying to inject a little realism into this situation . It would be a poor bargain for all of us if Laurel picked up a little money or a little loving at the expense of breaking her grandfather 's heart . I mean that liter- ally . He 's old enough , and vulnerable enough , and enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We do n't want that to happen , " I said , thinking of the power- ful reasons the woman had for keeping him alive . Her dark gaze probed at my face . " You 're not taking me quite seriously , are you ? " 131 " I take you very seriously , Mrs. Hapgood . I always will , " I added half seriously . She smiled , and her whole appearance changed , the way a young girl 's will when her feelings are touched . " Then I 'll show you something that may interest you . " It was in the book in her hands , a large thin volume with the title River Valley Annual printed across the front of the green cloth binding . She opened it on a refectory table which stood against the wall , and leafed through the pages as I looked over her shoulder . There were some stories and poems by the River Valley students , reports on soccer and girls ' hockey and the debating season , a message from the headmaster , and a double-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connie Hapgood herself , a girl in her twenties , with shaggy hair , wearing a bright appealing unfinished look . She lingered over her picture for a moment , as if the girl she had been had taken her by surprise . " I forgot I was in this book . " " You have n't changed much . " " Liar . That was fifteen years ago . Fifteen long years . " With visibly nervous fingers , she turned some more pages to the photographs of the graduating seniors . The pictures were captioned with the students ' names and predictions of their futures , evidently written by their classmates . Connie pointed out a rather fat-faced boy with an uneasy smile and dark angry dubious eyes . His name was Harold Sherry , and his prediction was : " World 's greatest gourmet . Seriously , when Harold discovershimself , it will be a major discovery ! " Connie read it aloud in a meditative tone , and added , " I wonder if Harold ever did discover himself . " " Is this the Harold who ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Harold . The school expelled him , of course , in addition to what the court did , and he never did graduate . Butit was too late to take his name and picture out of the yearbook . " " What did the court do ? " Sleeping Beauty 132 " Put him on probation for six years . " " That 's fairly stiff . " " I agree . All he did , after all , was run off with a girl who was perfectly willing to go along . Who may have instigated the Las Vegas trip , in fact . But nothing was done to Laurel , because she was two or three years younger than Harold . And things got worse for him . He broke probation and ran away , and they brought him back and put him in jail for a while . His father turned his back on him , which did him no good with the court . " " Who is his father ? " " Roger Sherry . He was an engineer , and he lived here in El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Sherry and his wife split up , I think over Harold . That little escapade in Las Vegas was really the end of the family . " I picked up the book and carried it to the window . Harold Sherry 's unformed face seemed vaguely familiar , and it grew more familiar as I studied it . Under the thick flesh which the boy had worn like a mask , I thought I could make out the facial structure of the broad-shouldered man I had seen at Blanche 's last night , and again at Sandhill Lake this afternoon . Both the boy and the man had the eyes of an angry dreamer . The woman came up behind me , so close that I could feel the movement of her breath in the still air : " Is Harold involved in this present mess ? " " He may be . " " You can speak frankly , " she said . " I 'm on Laurel 's side , whatever you may think . The split in the family is n't of my making . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right mind would want to get her back . " " Are Harold and Laurel together , Mr. Archer ? " " I do n't know . They may be . " " Does that mean that the kidnapping  --  the alleged kidnapping  --  isa put-up job , as it was the other time ? " " It 's possible , " I said . " But events never repeat themselves exactly , especially in crime . There are too many variables , and133the world has changed in the last fifteen years . It 's a good deal more dangerous . Harold may be , too . " " Did he shoot Jack ? " " Someone who looked like him did . " " You 're hedging , are n't you ? " " I saw the man who shot Jack from a long way off . I ca n't besure of the identification on the basis of that and a fifteen-yearoldpicture . " I closed the book and gave it back to her . " Do n't you want to know where his mother lives ? " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her house is on Lorenzo Drive . " She took me to the front door and pointed across the valley . " It 's a pink stucco house standing by itself on a knoll . I think the poor woman lives there alone . There are quite a few lonely women in this place . They move out here with their husbands and think they 'll be taken care of forever and ever . But then something happens and the whole illusion breaks down . " Her voice was full of feeling ; she might have been talking about herself . I could n't tell if she was a hard woman who had moments of softness , or a soft woman who could be hard on occasion . It was n't easy to tell , about any woman . I thanked her for her trouble and went out to the Cadillac . William Lennox was sitting behind the wheel out of sight of the front door , where Connie Hapgood lingered . He had changed his dude clothes for a dark suit and a homburg in which he looked very old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He regarded me truculently , but I got the impression that a light breeze would blow him over and that any kind of blow , physical or mental , would shatter him . " I want you to drive me into town , " he said . " Somebody has to pick up the pieces , and it looks as if I 'm elected . Jack 's out of the picture , and Ben Somerville is n't worth the powder to blow him to hell . He 's a born loser . He started out by blowing up his ship and he 's ending up by blowing up my oil business . " Sleeping Beauty 134His speech was sibilant and a little slurred , and his voice hurried as though he wanted to get it all out before he forgot what he intended to say . I wondered if it was the tranquilizer he had " he said . " I do n't have bloody all day . I want to see my son . Is he badly hurt ? " " I do n't believe so , Mr. Lennox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You better stay here with Mrs. Hapgood . " " But there are decisions to make . " " You can make them here . " His face reddened . " If you wo n't drive me , I 'll drive myself . This is my son 's car . " " It would n't be a good idea for you to drive . " He took off his homburg and punched it with his frail bony fist . " Dammit , do n't tell me what to do . I do n't allow it . Get out and I 'll drive myself . " His words were bold and angry , but his voice was uncertain . His white hair clung like smoke to his spotted scalp . His eyes kept moving , like water under wind . He seemed to be caught in an old man 's uncertainty , too weak to go but not content to stay . He looked both angry and grateful when Connie approached the car and spoke to him : " Mr. Archer is n't going into town . He has some investigative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rest now . " " Who needs a rest ? " " You need a rest . So do I. We both do . Come on , William , or I 'll get Dr. Langdale after you . " Her voice was maternal and seductive . He got out of the car and put his crumpled homburg on his head . She laughed at him and pushed it down so that his ears stuck out . He laughed , too , pleased and flattered by her horseplay . They walked back toward the house together , a pair of ill-matched comedians making the best of it . XXIVThe pink house on Lorenzo Drive had a slightly abandoned look . The shrubs and flowers around it were either overgrown or dying , and when I turned off the Cadillac 's engine there was a waiting stillness in the air . I went around to the back of the house and looked inside the garage . It contained an aging gray Mercedes , a woman 's bicycle , and a lot of gardening equipment . No green Falcon . No bloody footprints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the door . Mrs. Sherry was a long time answering . Eventually I heard her soft movements inside . A key turned over in the lock and the door opened on a chain . She was a faded woman who shaded her eyes from the light as if she had spent the day immured in darkness . " What do you want ? " " A chance to talk to you for a few minutes . " " Who are you ? " " I 'm a private detective . " I told her my name . " Is it about Harold ? " " I 'm afraid it is . May I come in , Mrs. Sherry ? " 135I thought as I drove downhill across the valley that there was something real there after all . No doubt they had made a kind of bargain : that she would stay with him and look after him until he died ; then his money would look after her until she died . Sleeping Beauty 136 " I do n't see much point in it . He does n't live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time ago to go our separate ways . " She sounded like a woman who had broken off an unhappylove affair , or barely survived an illness . " But you jumped to the conclusion that I came here on his account . " " I did ? " She sounded genuinely puzzled . " You must be mistaken . I had and have no idea why you came here . " " I 'd like to discuss it with you , though . May I come in , Mrs. Sherry ? " She hesitated . The skin tightened around her mouth and eyes . She seemed to be winding up her nerve to shut the door on me . " Harold 's been wounded , I think . " Shock struck her face a glancing blow . I guessed that she had been struck in that way many times before , and had learned the tricks of moral evasion . If you withdrew your spirit deep into yourself and out of sight , it could n't be completely destroyed . But it might go blind in the internal darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come in and tell me about it . " She held back her crucial questionuntil we were seated facing each other in her dim formal living room : " Is Harold going to die ? " " I do n't believe so . " " Where is he ? " " I do n't know that . I saw a young man who looked like him at Sandhill Lake this afternoon . He drove away in a green Falcon . " " It must have been someone else . My son does n't have a car like that . He does n't have any car . " " How do you know if you 're not in touch with him ? " " I did n't say that . I still hear from Harold . " She added withunexpected rigor , " When he wants something from me . " " Have you heard from him today ? " " Yesterday . " " What did he want ? " 137 " To borrow my car . I refused . " She looked at me with a certaindesperate hopefulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further pain . " Why did he want your car ? " " He did n't say . But I knew something was afoot . " " How did you know that ? " " I know my son . He sounded excited , as if he 'd had another one of his grand ideas . " Another phony kidnapping ? I almost said it out loud to her , but I held back . The world and I had been pressing her rather hard . I did n't want to hurt her deeply , and I did n't want to lose her . There was the further problem of identity , and the possibility that I had the wrong man and the wrong mother . She had recovered enough of her nerve to ask , " What happened at Sandhill Lake ? My husband  --  Harold 's father used to go shooting at the lake . " " There was some more shooting there today . A double shooting . Her hand went to her throat as if to hold back the question , but it came out : " Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . But before we go any further , I 'd like to see a picture of Harold . " She brightened . " You mean you 're not sure that Harold is involved ? " " Not absolutely sure . Do you have a recent picture ? " " I have one from a couple of years ago . It 's in my bedroom . " She brought it to me in hopeful trepidation , carrying it as if it was a bomb that needed defusing : a small photograph of a worried-looking young man who had lost some weight and gained some years since his picture was taken for the River Valley yearbook . It was certainly the man I 'd seen at Blanche 's , and almost certainly the one who had ambushed Jack Lennox in the tower at Sandhill Lake . " I 'm afraid he 's the one . " I put the picture down on a coffee table . " Who did he shoot ? " Sleeping Beauty 138 " Jack Lennox . " The life retreated from her face , leaving it vacant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head with her hands . She said : " It 's starting all over again , is n't it ? " " I do n't know what you mean . " " That terrible trouble with the Lennox family . Harold was only a boy when it started . He was n't the criminal they made him out to be . He was physically too mature for his years ; that was the main trouble with him . He wanted to marry Laurel . That 's why they went to Las Vegas  --  they thought they could get a preacher to marry them . But they ran out of money , and Laurel had the bright idea of pretending to her parents she 'd been kidnapped . It was Laurel 's idea , but Harold was the one who got the blame . Her father went to Las Vegas and searched them out and gave my son a terrible beating and threw him in jail . Harold was only eighteen , and he never recovered from the trauma . I 've got doctors who will swear to that in court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college graduates , but Harold never went back to school . " She sat up blinking , as if she had talked her way by a subterranean route back to the present . " Where is Harold now ? " " I wish I knew . " " But you said that he 'd been shot . " " He got away from the lake under his own power . Jack Lennox went in an ambulance . " " Is Mr. Lennox hurt badly ? " " I do n't know . He has a head wound . It looked fairly superficialto me , but I 'm not a doctor . " " Is Laurel involved in this , too ? " " I 'm afraid she is , Mrs. Sherry . Laurel 's been kidnapped again . Your son met her father at the lake to collect the ransom for her return . The ante has gone up since the other time in Las Vegas . This time it 's a hundred thousand dollars . " 139 " Harold is asking the Lennox family for that much money ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's already collected it , as I said . The delivery was made to him at Sandhill Lake earlier this afternoon , by Jack Lennox . Your son and Jack Lennox evidently shot each other . " She shook her head in a flurry of rejection . " I wish I had never given birth to a son . " But when she heard herself , she could n't stand the chill of loneliness . " Laurel put him up to it . Remember it was her idea the first time . " " Maybe it was . But that was a long time ago , and people change . This time it could be real . " " You think he kidnapped Laurel ? " " He claimed he did . He took money from her father . " " Is that what you want ? To get the money back ? " " I want Laurel back . I do n't really care about the money . Nobody does . If you can get that message to Harold , it might help . " " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she looked at me as an agent might look , willing to barter and trade with what knowledge she had . " You said he phoned you yesterday . " " Yes . He wanted my car . " " Where was he phoning from ? " " He did n't say . " " Was it a long-distance call ? " " I do n't really know . It only lasted a minute . When I refused to lend him my car , he got angry and hung up on me . " A flicker of pain crossed her face , as if the receiver had crashed in her ear again . " But I 'm glad I did n't let him have it . " " You knew something was afoot , you said . " " I did n't actually know anything . But he sounded excited  --  the kind of excitement I 've learned not to trust . My son is young for his years , and terribly excitable . " " Harold is at least thirty , is n't he ? " She looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fifteenSleeping Beauty 140years had somehow passed unnoticed . Her lips moved in calculation . " He 's thirty-three . " " That means he is n't a child . What does he live on ? " " I help him out . And of course he 's held a number of jobs . One thing you can say for Harold , he is n't lazy . " " What kind of jobs ? " " He 's been a busboy recently , while he 's looking for something better . " " Where does he live , Mrs. Sherry ? " " I do n't know . Somewhere on the beach . " " It 's a long beach , " I said , " from San Diego to Isla Vista . " " He was in Isla Vista at one time . But he came back to Los Angeles . I do n't know where he 's living now ; he has n't told me . Except when he wants something from me , he treats me as if I were his enemy . " " Does he have girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . He mentioned her the last time we talked . But I 've never seen her . I think Harold is ashamed of her . " " Why do you think that ? " " He refused to answer any personal questions about her . She may be a married woman . " " Laurel is married . Has Harold been seeing Laurel ? " She did n't answer me right away . " Has Harold seen Laurel recently ? " I said . " Yes , he has . Apparently he met her in Los Angeles , and she invited him to her house . I warned him not to go on seeing her . She 's always been a terrible influence on him . " " How do you know she invited him to her house ? " " He told me so . " " Yesterday ? " " A week or two ago . " " So you 've been in fairly continuous contact with him ? " " He comes to me for money . But I have n't been able to give him much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a trust , and the income does n't go as far as it used to . " 141 " When he mentioned Laurel , what was his attitude ? " " He was grateful , " she said with some scorn . " Grateful to her for inviting him to dinner . I told him he should have more pride , after what her family did to him . I told Harold he was demeaninghimself by accepting anything from Laurel Lennox . " " What was his reaction ? " " I do n't know . He did n't answer me directly . But I knew I 'd given him something to think about . " She sat in silence , trying to understand her life . Her body moved as if it was wrung by pain . I got the impression that there was an almost physical connection between her and her son , stretching like an umbilical cord from where she sat to where he was laying down his bloody footprints . " I do n't know what 's going to happen , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst has already happened . " She took this as an optimistic remark . " Yes . I 'm sure it has . And I 'm sure that he has n't  --  that nothing has happened to Laurel . " " I 've got to find her before something does . Where do I look , Mrs. Sherry ? " " I have no idea . " " Did n't he give you an address , or a phone number ? " " Yes . But he 's always kept moving on . I believe he 's moved again in the last week or so . " " Since he went to Laurel 's house for dinner ? " She considered the question . " Yes . " " What was his last previous address ? " " He was living someplace in Long Beach  --  I never actually knew where . I think he was living with a woman . " " How do you know ? " " His attitude toward me changes , " she said . " He always becomesso much more independent . But then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman ? " " No . " " Where would he go to have his wound looked after ? " Sleeping Beauty 142 " I do n't really know . " " Does he have a personal doctor ? " " He did have . I directed him to send his bills to me . They were very reasonable . His name was Dr. Lawrence Brokaw . " She stood up in sudden decision . " I 'll see if I can find his address for you . " Mrs. Sherry came back after a while carrying a sheet of notepaper , blue and deckle-edged , on which she had written Dr. Lawrence Brokaw 's office address in Long Beach . Her handwriting was small and elegant . She stood nervously beside me as I read it . " You wo n't have to tell Dr. Brokaw about this ? " " About what ? " " The kidnapping  --  the supposed kidnapping . After all , I 'm sure it was Laurel 's idea . There 's no reason why my son 's name should be dragged in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but had become so tense she was virtually chattering . I folded her sheet of notepaper and put it in my pocket . " A crime has been committed , perhaps a capital crime . A young woman is missing . Your son has collected ransom money for her , and he 's been shot . But all you 're worried about is bad publicity . " " I 'm worried about a lot more than that . But I know what bad publicity can do to a boy and his family  --  I 've seen it happen . Harold has never been the same , and neither have I. " " What happened to Harold 's father ? " " He worked as an engineer for the Lennox company . Naturallyhe lost his job , and he had a hard time getting another . The last I heard of Roger , he was living in Texas , somewhere on the Gulf Coast . With another woman , " she added bitterly . " Are you divorced ? " " Yes , I divorced Roger . He turned against his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Roger must be quite old by now . He 's quite a few years older than I am . And I 'm not young . " 143 " We 're all getting older . When I saw Harold in Pacific Point last night , he was with a little old man in a tweed suit . The man had lost most of his hair . It looked as if it had been burned off , and he had burn scars on his face and scalp . " She made a face . " He sounds horrible . " " He is n't , really . He was just a little old man who had seen his best days . Have you ever seen him with Harold ? " " No . " " Or have any idea who he might have been ? " " I have no idea . He was n't Harold 's father , if that 's what you 're thinking . Roger 's a big man with a lot of hair , and no scars of any kind . Anyway , he would n't be caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , I asked her to give me Harold 's picture , expect- ing that she would refuse . But she let me take it . I think she realized that Harold had to be found , and that I might be more likely than some others to bring him in alive . XXVWhen I passed Sandhill Lake on my way north , it was swarm- ing with uniforms . It looked like the scene of the annual picnic of the Sheriff 's Officers ' Benevolent Association . I did n't stop . I would have had to tell them about Harold Sherry . I drove directly to Seahorse Lane and found Elizabeth alone in what appeared to be an empty house . She greeted me without warmth and led me in silence into the big front room . Its front windows were now heavily smeared with oil . Through them ISleeping Beauty 144could see that the receding tide had left the beach dark and glistening , as if it had been covered with black oilcloth . " Where have you been ? " Her tone was faintly accusatory . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go there . " " It paid off , though not in the way I expected . Is your mother here ? " " She 's in her room . Mother is quite upset . " " About Jack ? " " It 's naturally hit her very hard . And now Tony Lashman is missing . It makes me wonder if he is n't involved in what 's happened to Laurel . Mother must be having the same idea . " " How did he leave ? " " Apparently he just walked away down the beach . He has no car . " " Where are the others ? " " My husband took Marian to the hospital , to be with Jack . " " How is your brother ? " " He 's surviving , that 's all I know . " She gave me a long cold look . " I 'm afraid I do n't understand what you were doing when Jack was shot . " The angry feeling in her voice was more pronounced . It seemed to be directed against the world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her probably reflected a change in her entire family . One of them had been taken , and one wounded , and they felt under siege . " I saw what happened at Sandhill Lake from a distance . " I explained to Elizabeth how that was . " I did n't actually witness the shooting of your brother but I 'm reasonably sure who did it . " I got the photo of Harold out of my inside pocket . " Do you recognize him ? " She held the picture close to one of the smeared windows . " It 's Harold Sherry , is n't it ? " " Yes . " 145 " I knew he was up to something . He came out to my house in Bel-Air and did some pretty wild talking . " " When was that ? " " Just last week . " " And what did he say , exactly ? " " I prefer not to tell you . " " I would prefer not to be here at all . " I realized as I said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a quiet way . We had been intimate the night before , not only in the physical sense . But the morning and the afternoonhad carried us far apart , and we seemed to blame each other for the distance . " You 're perfectly free to leave , " she said . " I did n't mean that . " " But I did . " I sat down facing her . " We 're both under strain . We both want to get Laurel back . That 's the main thing , is n't it ? " She took a deep breath . " I suppose you 're right . But where is she ? " " I 'm reasonably sure that Harold knows . " " Then where is Harold ? " " That 's the question . The things he said to you might bear on it . " She sat down , studying the photograph as if it was a mirror in which she could see that she had lost her looks . I said : " Was Harold in the habit of visiting your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen him in years . I did n't know who he was until he told me . He 's much better-looking than he was in his teens . But I 'm afraid he 's still the same old Harold . " " Exactly what do you mean ? " " He pretended to have come on a friendly visit , to get my forgiveness for the past or something of the sort . He 'd already been in touch with Laurel and she had forgiven him , or so he said . But I 'm sure he did n't come to see me for any friendly reason . " She paused , and her face turned quite bleak as sheSleeping Beauty 146remembered the conversation . " I got the impression that he was trying to ferret out the family secrets . " " What secrets ? " " You know one of them , " she said without meeting my eyes . " I should n't have told you what I did last night , about Ben and that young woman who came to our house with the boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't intend to . Was that one of the things that Harold was interested in ? " " Yes . But he had it wrong . Harold Sherry is one of those people who always get things wrong . He seemed to think that it was Jack who had been the woman 's lover . " She smiled very dimly . " I wish it had been . " " Are you sure it was n't ? " " Absolutely certain . Jack was still in the East attending Navy Communications School when the woman came to Bel-Air and talked to me . And it was definitely Ben she was talking about . " " Did Harold tell you where he got the information ? Or mis-information ? " " He 'd been in touch with Laurel , as I said . But it 's hard to imagine Laurel talking about her father in those terms . It 's possiblethat Harold heard the story from someone , and got it distortedin his own mind . He really hates my brother Jack , you know . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to say about Laurel . " She sat in silence for a while . Outside the house I could hear the dull surf measuring off its long-drawn-out intervals . " He said that they were friends again . He 'd had dinner at her house , and he liked her husband . " " Was he sincere , do you think ? " " It 's hard to say . A man like Harold is never completely honest . He does n't like himself enough really to like anyone else . And he 's always got more than one thing going on in his head . " 147 " What kind of things ? " " He did n't talk about them to me  --  at least not openly . But I can imagine the kind of things they are . Blackmail and fraud and what have you ? He 's a very mixed-up person . " " I know that . What I 'm trying to find out is this . Did Harold kidnap Laurel this time around , as he claims ? Or did the two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ? " " I simply ca n't believe that Laurel would do that . " " She did once . " " When she was a fifteen-year-old . She 's changed since then . Laurel 's really quite a well-intentioned person . She tries very hard . And she 's always been more of a victim than a victimizer . " We were back again at the riddle of Laurel . " Perhaps , " I said , " it does n't make so much difference whether she 's consciously one or the other . Harold is the one that makes the difference . He may have a kind of hex on her , going back to adolescence . I 've seen it happen to other girls , especially ones that do n't get along with their parents . " " I know what you mean . " She added thoughtfully , " Jack can be pretty hard to take . " " Tell me this . When Harold Sherry came to your house , did he say anything about where he was staying ? Or a phone numberwhere you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question . " No , he did n't . " " What kind of a car was he driving ? " " An old green compact . " There was a telephone in the room , and with Elizabeth 's permissionI used it to make a call to Dr. Lawrence Brokaw in Long Beach . The woman who answered said that Dr. Brokaw was with a patient . If I 'd leave my name and number , the Doctor would call me back . Sylvia Lennox had come into the room as I was talking . She peered at my face as if she was afraid of what she might find there . Sleeping Beauty 148 " What happened to my son , Mr. Archer ? " " He was wounded by a man named Harold Sherry . " I was sure of it now . " But I sent you with him to look after him . " " He needed more looking after than I could give him . He wanted to take care of the situation all by himself . " She did n't seem to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among her troubles . " And now Tony Lashman has deserted me . What do you think has happened to Tony ? " " I do n't know . When did you see him last ? " " This morning , when I put him in his place . " She moved between her daughter and me to the window . Her lean wrinkled face looked softer and more shapeless , as though the blows that had fallen on her had been physical . She said , in a thin and mournful voice which was shaken by gusts of fury : " All my life I 've tried to do my duty , and this is what it 's come to . My only son has been shot . My beach is covered with filth . My granddaughter is missing . And Tony left without even saying goodbye . " She turned from the window , her eyes wide , full of the dark scene . " I blame the men for this . " " What men , Mother ? " " All the men . I 've sat back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a woman , they take her . William did that . Ben put an oil well where no oil well belongs . Look at what he 's done to my beach . And Jack has been shot . I want to go and see him . " Elizabeth put an arm around her mother 's shoulders . " Stay here with me . You would n't like it at the hospital , Mother . " " I do n't like it here , either . " She turned to me and spoke in a more reasonable tone : " Did you say Harold Sherry shot Jack ? " " Yes . " The old woman nodded grimly . " I warned Jack to take it easy on that boy . I told him when a girl runs off with a boy , you can't149always blame the boy one hundred percent . But Jack was determined to destroy him . He would n't let the court give him juveniletreatment , and William used his influence to see that he was put in jail . And now the boy is striking back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want no part of it . I 'm opting out . Let the men handle it . It 's all their doing . " She turned and left the room , moving uncertainly . She had stumbled under the pressures of the day , and age had overtaken her . " Mother 's always felt like that , really , " Elizabeth said . " She 's never said it quite so explicitly , but it 's been her philosophy of marriage all along . Let the men go ahead and take the responsibility and make the mistakes . And then the women can sit back and feel superior . It 's not a very good kind of inno-cence . " " Any innocence may be better than none . " " I used to think so . But I 'm beginning to wonder . You 've got to use your innocence for something . You ca n't just keep it in a hope chest . " Her voice was low and very personal . She was talking about herself as well as her mother , and she sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Beth ? " Her head came up in response to her name . " It is n't what you think it is , exactly . The fact is I 've been giving my husband a very hard time generally  --  ever since Harold Sherry came and talked to me . I bitterly resented that young woman , whoever she was , and I took it out on Ben every way I could . And I wonder , if I 'd given him some peace  --  a chance to think  --  if he might not have made the mistake that blew the well . " " You 're reversing your mother 's philosophy , " I said , " and really reaching for a piece of guilt . " " Because it belongs to me . To the extent that Ben was responsible , then I 'm responsible , too . " " How do you know he was responsible ? " Sleeping Beauty 150 " He told me . He allowed the well to be drilled without adequatecasing , and even after there were signs of trouble he ordered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake in judgment . You ca n't make yourself responsible for it . " " I am , though , partly . " " You mean you want to be . " " I am , and I want to be . " The phone rang beside me . I picked it up : " Archer speaking . " " This is Dr. Brokaw . Did you call me ? " The voice was youngish , and a little breathy . " Yes . It 's about a patient of yours . " " What patient ? " " Harold Sherry . He 's in trouble . " There was a flat silence . " I 'm very sorry to hear that . Is it serious ? " " Just about as serious as it can get . He 's wanted for kidnapping . He was wounded by gunfire and dropped out of sight . I thought he might go to you . " " He has n't . Are you a policeman ? " " A private detective . Do you have an address for Harold ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me ? " There was another silence , divided into equal segments by his breathing . " I 'm afraid I ca n't give out patients ' addresses over the phone . " " Not even when a young woman 's been kidnapped ? " " You say you 're a private detective . If a woman 's been kidnapped , why have n't I heard from the police ? " " I 'm the one who has your name . I got it from Harold 's mother . If you want me to give it to the police  --  " " No . Look . Where are you now ? " " Pacific Point . " " Can you come here to my office ? I 'll be finished with my151other  --  with my patients by half past five . Then we can talk about Harold . " He hung up on me . Elizabeth moved across the room and stood above me with her fists clenched . " Wo n't he help ? " " I think he will . " " If he 's a local doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He is n't , though . He practices in Long Beach . And I 'll probably get further with him by myself . " Her general anger focused on me again . " You 're very selfconfident , are n't you ? Overconfident , perhaps , considering your failure to protect my brother . " " The only way I could have protected your brother was by putting him in irons . He did n't want me to go to Sandhill Lake with him . It looked as if he wanted to have a shoot-out . Anyway , he got one . And I 'm not taking any responsibility for it . Your brother pointed a gun at me and ordered me out of the77car . " Really ? " " I 'm not making this up . " " But why would he do a thing like that ? " " I do n't know , but I plan to ask him . I 'm going over to the hospital now . " Elizabeth did n't put up any further argument . Letting me out into the courtyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knob of an outside door between the back door and the garages . The door failed to open . I said : " What 's in there ? " " It 's Tony Lashman 's room . I keep hoping he 'll turn up . I 'm worried about him . " " Are you sure he is n't in his room ? " " I 'm not sure about anything . " The lock on the door was of the Yale type , easy to open with a plastic credit card . The room on the other side of it was large but rather makeshift , incompletely walled with knotty pine . Sleeping Beauty 152The single bed was unoccupied and unmade . There was no one under the bed and no one in the closet . The floor of the closet was piled with dirty clothes intermingled with sections of a black rubber wet suit . A windup alarm clock sat on the table beside the bed . It was n't ticking . It had stopped a few minutes short of midnight , or of noon . XXVII drove across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the front desk , that Jack Lennox was in a private room on the top floor . In the hallway outside his door , I found Sergeant Shantz sitting on a metal folding chair which his flesh overlapped . " Where have you been ? " he said . " I returned Jack Lennox 's car , and got involved with the family . How is he doing ? " " Okay . His wife is in there with him . " Shantz rose heavily , pushing his chair back against the wall . " If you 're going to be here for the next few minutes , I should make a phone call . The Sheriff asked me to let him know when Lennox was able to talk . " The Sergeant moved down the hall toward the elevators , and I went into the room . It was dim , with the curtains partly closed over the windows . Marian Lennox was standing in a protective attitude by the head of the bed . She looked rather resentful of my intrusion , as153if she valued this time alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a turban of bandage . " Archer ? " He tried to sit up . His wife pushed him gently back against the pillows . " Please , Jack . You 're not supposed to get up . " " Stop making like a nurse , for God 's sake . " He moved rebelliouslyunder her hands . " You 're not good at it . " " But the doctor says you need complete rest and quiet . After all , you 've been shot . " " Who shot me ? " " Do n't you remember ? " I said . " No . The last thing I remember is opening the door of the tower  --  the lookout tower at Sandhill Lake . " He groaned . " Why did you go there ? " " It 's where I was supposed to leave the money . " His voice was losing its force . " Who asked you to leave it there ? " " Nobody I knew . " He looked at his wife . " Do you know who it was ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him once , when he made the first call . I did n't recognize his voice . " " It hardly matters , anyway , " I said . " It was probably the same man who shot you . And I know who that was . " They waited in silence for me to tell them . When I gave them Harold Sherry 's name , Jack Lennox seemed blankly puzzledby it , as if the shot that had wounded him had driven all memory of Harold from his brain . But Marian 's face changed . She looked as if she could feel the recurrence in her body of an old illness . " Do n't you remember Harold ? " I said to him . " You shot him in the leg . " " I shot him ? You 've got to be kidding . " He sat up , balancing his head like a heavy weight . " Does that mean you 've captured him ? " " Not yet . " Sleeping Beauty 154 " What about the money ? The hundred thousand ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present . I 'm going to have to tell the police about the money . " Lennox seemed uninterested . He did n't ask me about his daughter Laurel . I wondered if he had perhaps forgotten her , too . He let out a long sigh and collapsed against his pillows . Marian interposed herself between us . " I 'm afraid Jack is exhausted . Could n't we talk outside ? " " Of course . " She pulled up her husband 's covers , pressed his shoulder , and followed me out . She seemed to be under better control than she had been earlier . Her face was strained but focused . It occurred to me that she was one of that disappearing species of women who live in their husbands ' shadow and can only step out of it when the husbands are out of action . She said , when the door had closed behind her : " You have n't said anything about Laurel , Mr. Archer . " " There has n't been any word on Laurel . " " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . The way to her is through Harold Sherry . " " He got his money . What more does he want ? " " I do n't know . He may want some assurance of personal safety . The money 's no good to him if he does n't live to spend it . Her gaze moved past me , pale and desolate , looking down the long arctic slope of the future . " Jack should n't have shot him . " " No . It upset the bargain . But Harold may have fired at your husband first . " A puzzled cleft appeared between her eyes . " Why would he do that ? " " I 'll have to ask him . " " Do you have any hope of finding Harold Sherry ? " " Some . I know the name of a doctor he 's gone to in the past . With his leg wound , he 'll be wanting to get to a doctor . " 155 " Would I know the doctor 's name ? " " I doubt it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a few people in Long Beach . " " But I do n't think I better mention his name to anyone , even you . He 's my only decent lead so far . The chances of getting Laurel back are n't quite as good as they were this morning . I guess you know that , Mrs. Lennox . " She shook her head . " I do n't know . Everything is so confused . It was a sorry day for Laurel  --  for all of us  --  when she met Harold Sherry . This is n't the first time he 's abducted her , did you know that ? He ran away with her when she was just fifteen . " " I 've heard about it . But I do n't understand his motive . " " He was always envious of our family . " " Was he attracted to Laurel ? " " Perhaps he was , in a sick way . I remember once he came to the house  --  this was before he took her to Las Vegas . He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father to intervene . " " Laurel asked your husband to intervene ? " " That 's correct . Jack threw him out of the house . " Her voice was cold and featureless , like a medium reciting words whose meaning was not clear to her . " My husband has always had a violent temper . " " I 've seen a few indications of that . Tell me , Mrs. Lennox , has his temper ever been turned against Laurel ? " " Of course it has . Many times . " " Recently ? " " Yes . They have n't been getting along at all well lately . Jack has n't been too happy about her marriage . In fact he 's done his best to break it up . " She overheard herself and gave me a worried look . " What do you suspect Laurel of doing ? " " There is a possibility that she threw in with Harold of her own free will . " " When they went to Vegas ? " Sleeping Beauty 156 " Then , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was genuinely kidnapped last night ? " " I do n't know what to think . " She looked at me suspiciously . " What are you getting at , exactly ? " " The possibility of collusion . There 's some evidence that Laurel and Harold have been seeing each other . " " Where did you get that story ? " " I 'm sorry , I ca n't name my source . " There was enough bad blood between Harold 's mother and the Lennox family . " Anyway , I do n't believe it , " she said . She turned away to go back into her husband 's room , and paused with her hand on the door . I could see how thin and vulnerable she was . Her graying hair , cut in a long shag , curled like wispy feathers at the nape of her neck . Her shoulder blades stuck out under her dress like unfledged wings . She had lost her daughter , and her husband had been shot . It was the kind of experience that used people up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attrition continued , she could be old and defeated like Sylvia . " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Lennox . I thought you should know some of the possibilities . " She turned quickly and almost lost her balance . " Yes , of course . You 're right . I want you to keep me informed . " " I 'll try to do that . " " If Laurel is involved with Harold Sherry  --  I do n't believe it , you understand , but if she is  --  I want to know about it before anyone else . Particularly before you tell the police . " " I understand you . " But I made no promises . XXVIIIt was a long day . When Marian Lennox left me , I sat down in Shantz 's folding chair , leaned back against the wall , and let my mind go loose . Black waves washed over it , carrying me in to a black shore . I sat up with a start . Shantz stepped out of the elevator . He came toward me quickly , his belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood out on his forehead . " Sorry I kept you waiting . There 's been another death at the beach . " " Whose death ? " " We do n't know yet . A young fellow with black hair . We 've got him downstairs in the pathology department . If you want to take a look at him , it 's on the first floor , to your right as you leave the elevator . Captain Dolan is there with the Sheriff . " The elevator Shantz had left was still waiting . I touched the first-floor button and leaned on the wall of the descending cubicle . I felt as if I was going down to the bottom of things . A Chicano girl in a nurse's-aide uniform leaned in through the door as it opened . " Is something the matter ? " Her soft black eyes were solicitous . " No . There 's nothing the matter . " " I 'm going up . Do you want to go up ? " " No . " " Are you a patient ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . I stepped out into the first-floor corridor and walked toward the " Pathology " sign unwillingly . There had been too much violence for one day . I hunched my mind around a little until my scar tissue was back in place . Then I knocked on the door and went in . A grimly maternal woman behind a fixed desk dispatched me down a further corridor , through what seemed like zones of deepening cold , to the room where the dead man lay . He was still strapped to the aluminum stretcher on which the Sheriff and Captain Dolan had brought him in . His body was enclosed in a transparent plastic bag which had been opened at the top to reveal his head . It was Tony Lashman , with oil in his eyes , oil in his open mouth . " This is Lew Archer , " Dolan said . " Sheriff Sam Whittemore , Lew . " We shook hands across the body . Whittemore had a jolting blue glance which came at you unexpectedly out of a lined and worried face . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room . I told him that the dead man was Sylvia Lennox 's secretary , and that I had seen him alive at noon . " Where did you find him ? " " Just down the beach from Sylvia Lennox 's house . You ca n't see it in that position , but the back of his head was bashed in , apparently by a rock . " " Did you find the rock ? " The Sheriff 's bright blue eyes came up to meet mine . " We did n't find the rock . There 're a million rocks , all of them covered with oil , around where he was lying . " He leaned toward me . " You know the Lennox family , do you ? " " I 've met most of them in the last twenty-four hours . " " Just off the top of your head , now , do you have any idea who 's doing these killings ? " " I 'm afraid I do n't . " " Or why ? " 159 " I 'm working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't see much light . " " Neither can we . " He added quickly , " Do n't quote me . " Captain Dolan took his turn . " Is this the fellow you saw at Sandhill Lake when Lennox got shot ? " " No . It is n't . " " Are you sure ? " " I 'm quite certain . This is Sylvia Lennox 's secretary . " " Why would somebody knock him in the head ? Was he involved in that deal at the lake ? " " I do n't know . " The Sheriff said , " What was the nature of that deal ? I never did get it straight . " " Jack Lennox was supposed to pay over some money . " " Pay the other man some money ? " " That 's correct . " " What happened to the money ? " " The other man took it away with him . " Dolan said , " Why did n't you tell me that before ? " " I had to check with the Lennox family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The Lennox family ? " " Yes . " " And who were the Lennox family paying off ? " I sat in silence for a while , trying to think of a way to leave Laurel out , and a way to preserve my sense of not being an auxiliary policeman . But Laurel was far beyond the reach of my protection , and there seemed to be no point in protecting Harold Sherry . I gave them Harold 's name , and told them where he came from and what he had been doing . The only thing I held back was Dr. Lawrence Brokaw 's name and address in Long Beach .
