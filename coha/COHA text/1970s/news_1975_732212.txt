txt Letters to the Editor pg . 42 Letters to the Editor U.S. Defense : The Weakened Posture To the Editor : President Ford 's abrupt dismissal of Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger is an ominous sign to those Americans who support a strong national defense posture for the United States . While President Ford claimed that his firing of Secretary Schlesinger does not indicate any change in his policy of maintaining a defense " second to none , " appearances indicate otherwise . During his 27 months in office , Secretary Schlesinger took many actions designed to increase our national defense by increasing the military 's efficiency . For example , the Army has begun a program designed to reduce its supply " tail " and increase the number of combat divisions from thirteen to sixteen . Also , Secretary Schlesinger has pushed a program of smaller , lessexpensive aircraft carriers for the Navy which would allow =more carriers to be built , thereby decreasing the risks that the Navy may be unable to keep our vital sea lanes open in time of war . With respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mutual assured destruction doctrine of previous Administrations that subjected American Presidents to an all-or-nothing choice of destroying the world or giving in in the face of serious Soviet provocation . To Kill a Bird To the Editor : The hunting season imposes an unfair restriction on the non-hunters and nature lovers by denying us the freedom of hiking just when the crisp , clear days of autumn are here . Those of us who enjoy nature and like to go out and observe our wildlife dare not walk on the beaches and marshes to watch the migrating birds or venture into the woods to walk amid the autumn foliage and enjoy its beauty . The non-hunters who live near the coastal regions and marshes are subjected to the horrible sound of gunfire day after day as the slaughter of birds takes place . Why should the non-hunting public have to put up with this just so the hunters can indulge in their lust for killing ? Hunting is a cowardly sport . It pits Instead , Secretary Schlesinger 's addition of a counterforce capability has given the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security by increasing the credibility of our deterrent . And in NATO , Secretary Schlesinger has pushed for needed reforms in the area of weapons standardization as well as taking a firm stand for continued vigilance and preparedness in the face of ever-increasing Soviet conventional forces in Eastern Europe and European Russia . Perhaps , as President Ford maintained , the firing of Secretary Schlesinger does not indicate a shift in defense . policies . However , when an effective advocate of a strong national defense posture is removed from office during a time of severe criticism of him by Congress and a Secretary of State that would rather base their policy for our future security more on Russia 's good intentions and less on our capabilities , one must wonder . After all , even if President Ford really means it about not shifting our defense policies , the appearances are to the contrary . And unfortunately , in the area of national defense , appearances , especially when they are of decreased capabilities , can be very dangerous . PATRICK J. ALLEN Oak Park , Ill. , Nov. 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can not fight him back . MARY JANVRIN Old Lyme , Conn. , Oct. 31 , 1975 ? Loaded Questionnaire To the Editor : As all poll-takers know , it is difficult to design a set of questions concerning a controversial issue which is completely neutral . Built-in bias is hard to avoid . Of course , if a predetermined response is desired , it is possible to ask questions which answer themselves . A recently received letter from the executive director of the National Rifle Association , Harlon B. Carter , enclosed computer-coded cards containing questions supposedly aimed at securing the respondents ' opinions as to the relation between gun control and crime . As might be expected , the N.R.A . questions are heavily loaded against legislation to restrict the sale of firearms . For example , the words " restrict " and " control " were not used . Instead , the terms " ban " and " ... prohibiting all ownership " were . used in the questions . Mr. Carter 's letter states that the tabulated results of this survey under the title of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the press , TV , radio , Congress and state legislatures . The public should be put on notice that , as a correct measurement of public opinion on the real issue of gun control , the N.R.A . questionnaire will be worse than useless , in fact , completely misleading . MORLEY AYEARST East Hampton , L. I. , Oct. 24 , 1975 Perilous Federal Aid To the Editor : I am appalled at hearing New York City 's political and wealthy civic leaders demand Federal aid and then call for a citizen-based movement to obtain that aid , which would inevitably result in Federal jurisdiction over the city and probable anti-citizen policies ( for example , a freeze on city employees ' wages or increased layoffs or the abolition of rent control ) . This is a marvelous and recurrent example of American participatory democracy manqu ? because the real consequences for the average citizen are being obscured by the leaders ' use of a populist movement .

( Assoc . Prof. ) JAMES D. WEAVER Dept. of Politics , Marymount College Tarrytown , N. Y. , Oct. 31 , 1975 ? Furloughs to Help the City To the Editor : Here is a suggestion that could save money for New York immediately , while avoiding some tragic layoffs of young people who are supporting families : Civil-service workers should be offered the opportunity to volunteer for three-to-six-month payless furloughs . Chances are that those who would volunteer would be older people who have some savings and who , if over 62 , can get Social Security payments for the months they are off the city payroll . There might also be some younger people , with no dependents , who could manage for a short time on unemployment-insurance benefits . Of the elder people , some might find it so agreeable that they will decide to retire , thus speeding the attrition the city has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and medical benefits , etc. , be continued during the furlough , and that retirement and seniority status be continued as if the volunteer were still on the job . Although this is admittedly a shortterm help , it would save some money now for the city , and it would avert instant misery , if new layoffs are as likely as they seem , for many of the young families New York must retain to have a viable future . J. COOPER Brooklyn , Nov. 3 , 1975 ? Of Tokens and Seniors To the Editor : Ms. Adler 's suggestion in a recent letter that senior citizens be permitted to pay 25 cents for a token rather than the full 50 cents and receive a return slip is quite impractical . First , there would be no assurance that the token is used during the prescribed hours . Second , dishonest agents would be enabled to deduct 25 cents from many of the 50-cent payments made by non-seniors , with no way to check on them .
