Braniff flight to Dallas/Fort Worth on Sat- urday morning was empty enough for stewardesses to slip wine from first class to economy with nobody caring . The girls were in pink from head to toe . Baby-pink tights , long-sleeved pink wool dresses with a flare to the skirt , pink bows in the hair , and a silver apron-tunic over them . Cotton candy , great big birthday lollipops wrapped in silver paper , delectable sweeties to lick all over . We arrived early at Dallas Love Field ; it was 88 degrees on November 8 , and a few teenage girls in red , white , and blue were wandering through the airport to greet Mss Teenage America contestants and chaperons . I said goodbye to my travel companion , a man with pepper ? and-salt hair and china-blue eyes who was separated from his model wife and worried that his teenage daughter , a student at Southern Methodist , was about to participate in the New Morality . I rode the flatlands to Fort Worth , more than thirty miles away , to the Sheraton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l'ageant were staying for at least a week . The CBS technical crew had been there a week already , with some members of the Pageant staff , and by the night before , according to the master plan , all rooms were " set and ready to go . " A red carpet ran from the entrance of the Sheraton across two streets . over an entire block and into the Convention Center . Donated by the Ashe Carpet Company ( who assured its quality as palatial ) , it was , at 350 square yards , " thought to be the largest piece of carpet ever placed on a sidewalk . " Cars passed over it and later in the week would wear it away , but now , for the moment of arrival , the red carpet was long , luxurious , spread to receive the steps of young women between thirteen and seventeen , local queens who hoped for national coronation . The girls arrived with their chaperons , randy , full-breasted wives of local sponsors , skinny , pinched ladies of the local TV or radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . coarser features aped the younger ones and whose faces contained their own resignation , but also now held shrill ambition ; faces that had turned harpy in spite of themselves , for the sake of their daughters . The women were put into a stagecoach driven bymen in Hollywood makeup and they came to the Tarrant County Convention Center , a huge round building that would , in a week 's time , present the fairest flowers of American maidenhood to an estimated . TV audience of forty million . At the Center , a band of volunteers played lustily , majorettes twirled batons , and cowboys shot of guns while local news photographers snapped the scene . The Welcome Dinner was held at the Fort Worth Country Club . There was no liquor anywhere , and none would be seen for the rest of the week where the girls were , but would porn down the old throats and stiff guts of CBS people and in the rooms of Pageant and PR people ; cocktails can only be bought in private clubs and vigilant bottles of scotch stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But at the Country Club , no liquor , and the food game began : if it 's gray , it 's meat ; if it 's brown , it 's sweet . From now till next week ( and for the reigning queen , for a year ) there would be nothing but Dr Pepper to drink , a cola concoction with cherry syrup ( though some said prune ) , which was everywhere given away free because Dr Pepper is national endorser of the Miss Teenage Pageant . and will have free use of the queen . I was at a table with Miss St. Louis , a chubby , plain , and friendly-looking high-school senior in a rhinestone dress , with small brown eyes , lank hair , and pudgy arms . Miss Tidewater , Virginia , had a long , preacher 's face that would soon become the picket fence of her family , keeping out disorder , dirt , and insubordination . Now she was still a little girl schoolmarm , in a navy dress with a white organza bow . Her voice was soft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , ma'am .

" Loneliness is the crutch of poetry , and intense feelings are the crutch of poetry . And I have them . " In her nasal voice , Miss Toledo continued a monolog . Horrendously verbal . bright , she was like a thirty-year-old frenzied New York Jewess. 96 But she goes to parochial school and her town is conservative , " because anywhere up in the North , where it 's industrial , people are buckling down and they 're working .

" ) zip through their happy , jingling songs of the West . The " ya-hoo l " s are like yodels and they present a medley of Texas songs . " Deep in the Heart of Texas " has everyone clapping ; there 's " The Yellow Rosc of Texas " and songs to Dallas : Houston , Austin , and other towns , " The Streets of Laredo , " and then " The Eyes of Texas Are Upon You .

The theme of the evening was the theme of the Pageant , " to show the world the qualities of American womanhood , " as one speaker put it .

An investment hanker , he ON ns Cedar Point in Sandusky , Ohio . an amusement park where 2.500 well-groomed young people service an enormous establishment and abide by company policy to refuse entrance to anyone who might be disruptive to the other guests . Mr. Legros actively demonstrates his philosophy : " Clean people hate dirty places . Dirty people hate clean places . If you have a clean place , you wo n't get dirty people . " Cedar Point is spotless and Mr. Legros , delighted by the outstanding young Americans who work for him , gave further proof of his faith by buying Miss Teenage America , Inc. , last spring .

Because , he points out , these dissenters " protest about schools and do n't go to school ; they protest working conditions and are too lazy to work : they protest the war and evade the draft . " The chairman of the board was endorsed by applause and Melissa Babish , Miss Teenage America 1969. rose to speak . She was cute , wrinkled her nose , and made gestures of childish , helpless femininity . All were he . gniled when she began her speech with a long orig .

Main speaker was Dr. Edrington , president of the Schriner Institute , a school for boys in Kerrville , Texas . He was articulate . witty , an historian who talked of the first beauty contest ever held ? in Arabia 2000 n.c. ? and led into Biblical parables of responsibility and duty . His theme was the Greater Cause and he ended his lecture with a personal story of World War II when he had been in the Navy : The Japs controlled a hill and our boys were being constantly repulsed . They could n't take the hill , however , even though the battleship Tennessee was at the ready , because the Army had been assigned to do it . But Edrington , through cleverness , contacts , and courage , got the Tennessee to shoot . " They turned their guns and just took off the top of that hill . It was the prettiest sight you 'd ever want to see . Of course , " he added , " it was n't a happy Mother 's Day for some Japs . " Q unday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before the judgings and rehearsals would begin . A trip to the Rex Caublc Ranch was planned and I could go along . I could do almost anything because . by fluke or design . I had been issued one of the seven " Honored Guest " badges and , except for directly contacting any of the girls , I had free scope . No one could contact the girls ex ? cept the official Pageant staff ; the hotel operators had orders to allow no other calls through , and no messages could be taken . The girls were minors and pure . They were valuable to America and the corporation . They could do nothing without their chaperons and no girl went to the ladies ' room alone . Candidates were now charges , the indispensable property of a million-dollar enterprise which would be beamed out across the land on Saturday , Novem -- her 15 , to ( according to available Nielsen ratings ) a bigger audience than any of its televised competitors . Even Miss America was second-rate compared to this ; and those involved with Miss Teenage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no beauty contest . Girls were chosen for a combination of talent , poise , appearance . high grades , and ability to handle themselves with decorum and responsibility . The winner would receive a $10.000 scholarship to college , but during her year 's reign would have to meet the demands of schoolwork and those of her endorsers . This year only forty-five girls came , fewer than for the past years of the nine-year-old Pageant . Except for seven candidates-at-large , all were sponsored locally by enterprises that had bought the $10,000 franchise from Miss Teenage America , Inc . Local Pageants had been conducted in the same way as the national one was now to be . In Los Angeles , for instance , $20,000 had been spent by Bullock 's stores . The local winner often received prizes of clothes or money , sometimes both . She was then available for publicity purposes , and in many towns local interests were promoted by the local girl who was most charmingly typical of , or exemplary for , her generation . When the girl and her chaperon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses . The women were housed for a week at the Sheraton-Fort Worth and given three meals a day . Some of these expenses were undertaken by the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce ; and the Sheraton itself , mindful of publicity value in a butelful of lovelies , offered cut-rate prices . CBS paid $150,000 for rights to televise . Their entire production budget was approximately one-third million dollars , but they received over $400,000 from advertisers . A total of $380,000 came from local franchises , Dr Pepper paid his fee , and associate endorsers ( clothing and shoe manufacturers ) paid theirs . The girls were thirteen to seventeen , though almost all were sixteen or seventeen . One thirteenyear-old , one fourteen-year-old . One Negro ( from Alexandria , Virginia ) and a Miss Puerto Rico , but no one from the states of New York , New Jersey , Connecticut , and several others . Five from Texas , two from California ? most in fact were from the West . These nubile Americans shared bad skin , bad taste in clothes ( most wore things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup . Every girl wore eye makeup , and blue shadow ran in Texas heat . Some wore pancake or foundation and blotches spread , islands of makeup holding up smaller islands of blusher or gleamer . Streaks of makeup ran into the hair , down the neck , across the forehead . Mothers wore less , chaperons had faces expertly covered ; most girls wore their hair loose , but the women carried immobile structures on their heads . At the ranch , under Texas skies and hot sun , we met Cutter Bill , the most famous cutting horse in the world . First Missy . Miss Teenage America , and then other girls were posed on the horse or beside him ; one small contestant spent the entire time in the bus because she was allergic to horses . Cowboys were friendly , dressed in Western garb , and cowgirls wore eyelashes and makeup when they rode . I went into the small saloon , through swinging wooden doors , into the set of a Western , with nickelodeon and old pictures . Girls and chaperons were drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said journalists were the best kind they drink most ) , and gave me a man-sized plastic cup of scotch . Mrs. Cauble , our hostess , entered dressed in orange , had her cup refilled , said next year they 'd , , ask Mr. Teenage America down ( I suggested Mr. Universe and she agreed , yes , that would be an improvement , but " there 's just one man I want to get out here . and that 's Joe Namath " ) . She did n't know how many horses they had because " we do n't count that way , we count in pastures . " She did n't know how many pastures either , and hated to spend a lot of time at the ranch because it bored her . Though they sold horses at $50,000 apiece , the main income was from cattle . She was n't going to go out in the sun to watch the rodeo because " I 've had two heart operations and a brain operation this year and I 'm not going . " I had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back for a refill after each number . With her , with other women . I found sweet , sudden sisterhood through the secret , communal vice of liquor . The band struck up , we sang " The Star-Spangled Banner , " and Mr. Cauble came out on Cutter Bill with a large flag . The Bishop was in attendance on high , gave an invocation , and we all watched the roping of steer , the ladies riding , the obstacle race . I sat next to Kathy , a Donatello madonna from Sioux Falls , South Dakota , with no makeup on translucent skin , who said her talent act was the recitation of " The Last Flower " by Thurber and , because it was a plea for peace , she had been advised not to use it . But Kathy , who writes poetry , is one of thirteen children , and has organized a teenage dramatic workshop with her friends , insisted on keeping her piece . She was missing rehearsals of Viet Rock , which the kids were doing at home . Earlier they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own money for costumes , set , and everything else they needed and sent a batch of tickets to the police department , but nobody came . She was , of course , different from the other girls . Around us bright faces cheered , hard little buttocks and breasts , even harder hearts , waited under the sun for the next act . Like the girl in the movie Last Summer , their hardness and tenseness protected them . Little girls out for the big time , unhampered by imagination or charity , they were altogether virgins ready to strangle someone on a bit of flesh . In the ring , small animals were chased by mer on horseback , brave studs performing , for young ladies , the men with Marlboros on their lips riding the flat Texas country , hoping to cop a feel of false breast ( one-third of the girls wore paddec bras ) or a tight hip ( many wore girdles ) .

The middle one had told her father she was living with a boy . She had , he said , become a hippie despite an orthodox upbringing with literal interpretation of the Bible . After her first few weeks of college , she had asked to be transferred because there were so many atheists around she could n't stand it . But she stayed , and a few months later the father was called to the college with his daughter in deep depression . She told him she no longer believed in anything . A few weeks ago , the girl had asked him whether she could participate in the October 15 Moratorium . He said no and she obeyed him . coming later to say he was marvelous , because he could hear the word " Moratorium " without becoming hysterical , as her mother would have . Father and Mother went to sensitivity sessions for five days , seven hours a day , and discovered they were basically different people . A girl who lives away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join the Peace March , and obeys when he forbids it . I was still new to Texas and did n't know about the faith that is above all faiths , the belief in America , the hatred of Communism , the complete acceptance of an international conspiracy to take over the world . Sex was only a misdemeanor ; virginal parents could come to accept promiscuity , even pregnancy . But dissent , the questioning of our universe and our good was the ultimate falling from grace ; it was despair , the only sin , and sooner murder your family than betray America . S unday night , back from the ranch , the girls had a pajama party . Their makeup had been reap . plied , their lashes were in order , and they wore elaborate costumes , American nights instead of Arabian ones , with peignoirs , prints , pajama boots , and roses . They let no man see them , rushed away from the elevator if a male approached , even though a policewoman was inside and had been riding up and down for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls looked tired already , but smiled for the CBS cameramen who filmed the impromptu party . They hugged their Teddy bears and cuddled with each other over autograph books and reproductions of great American scenes they 'd been given . Some girls had risen at four or four-thirty in the morning , though the Welcome Banquet had gone on till midi night , so that they could fix their hair and makeup , do all the necessary to present themselves to judging eyes at breakfast . In twenty-four hours , some were already defeated . Bitchiness was close to the surface and some had shed their layer of youthfulness for a coating of gloss , the itnitation of youth which would be too childish , too cute for anyone but forty million viewers to believe . They had learned to be wary ; anyone here might have influence , every eye took them in , every word they spoke might prejudice them . A. show of temper or individuality would disqualify them , so they smiled at each other and complimented all outfits and food and the room . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 parted from the singing PR crew and K was free must of the day . Exploration : Fort Worth is known as " cow town ... where the West remains .

It has a wax reproduction of " The Last Supper " on continual display , and in a souvenir store with 59-cent and $1.49 items , two small Negro children and I examined the string ties , rosaries , towels , small guns , and containers of Mace . Driving out , through the park . I came to the campus of Texas Christian University , where I saw almost no girl with virginal , unbleached hair . Cute Texas co-eds walked by in dresses an inch above the knee , blond hair sprayed and immobile , faces carefully painted and set . It was impossible to tell from a distance of thirty feet whether an approaching female was forty-five or eighteen . The natural look , the slouch and swinging hair , had n't come to TU. ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamburger joint proclaimed : " Let 's Get Out of Vietnam ... the President 's Way . " Tacked on a tree , a poster invited participation in the Moratorium . What night the party for the girls was a carnival , 1 with cotton candy , booths , and a little jail . Mr. Legros walked around happily , chaperons became avid gamblers with play money , and the CBS people stuck around for fun . I put Lorna , Miss Toledo , into jail before she could put me in , but then gave her my stash of money . " You know how you should do your article ? " said somebody . " Just pour a lot of Dr Pepper on the pages . " The grown-ups went to drink other things in other rooms . Tightness had set in and this was only Monday . Paul Levitan , producer of the show for CBS , was having problems . There was an edge on everything , the budget might be exceeded , the big family was growing apart and needed soldering . At three , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to bed . In one room , we 'd been talking about war and the strong young Texan who 'd come back from Vietnam said he could kill men , women , and children and then sit down to enjoy his breakfast . There was nothing wrong with killing , he said : it made you feel good and that 's what it was all about . " Why should we rebel against the structure when it 's good ? " a candidate asked the next morning . " The structure that this nation is built on is not bad at all . Look at it : justice , equality , happiness , peace for men ? I do n't consider these bad or evil or invalid at all . " From Puerto Rico came a voice of reason : " We 've had some riots . They burned the ROTC building of the university campus . They were having a hunger strike ... but one by one they were taken to the hospital because they were fainting . Blah . I hate them . They 're stupid . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was great to be here , they 'd already learned a lot . It was marvelous to be able to talk to girls from all parts of the country . It was an education , everyone was so nice , so interesting , everyone was like a sister . We all agree on things , there 's no generation gap , that 's silly , it 's much harder to get along with some other members of your own generation than with your parents . These hippies are awful . Who do these kids think they are , protesting the President ? What do they know , what does anybody know compared to him ? All day they came into the room adjoining the press room and my tape recorder caught the accents , the acts , the self-assurance . Missy talked about her year 's reign , how hard it was to keep up her A average , how many interesting people she had met , how she 'd developed her own style in dressing , and how , yes , she 'd met some of the minority teenagers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? which is true in a sense . " She meant ( though could n't tell me ) that in her year as Miss Teenage America her purpose had been to promote the products of her endorsers . She had flown to all parts of the country , had missed sleep , school , and friends for a reward not of self-knowledge but of education in public relations . By selling herself she sold the goods , and Missy 's laughter was now easy ; her little shoulders bobbed up and down in immediate appreciation , her smite was already there , and the eyes had learned to quickly evaluate response . " This year I found out a heck of a lot of things , " said Missy . " I believe in going up in change and not going down . The SDS are making the silent majority say , ' Hey , wait a minute . We 're not going to be silent anymore and we 're going to say what we want . ' People are getting united through this Moratorium , " she told me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , because I do n't know everything about it . And I ca n't say the war is good , because I do n't know everything about it . And until I do , I will not make that statement . " The war was a theme all week . There was no avoiding the fact that the Pageant would be held on the same day as the March on Washington : in Dallas , the wearing of black armbands had been declared illegal by a judge who said that though the ruling might he unconstitutional , it would be enforced . To wear red , white , and blue armbands was proper and patriotic . The Miss Teenage America Pageant was , for the first time , emphatically patriotic in theme . The opening number would show candidates in red , white , and blue singing " It 's a Grand Old Flag " and " Yankee Doodle Dandy . " Even the girls were aware that they were part of a planned response to the dissenting minority . Miss Wichita said , " I 'm glad it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would show to all America that there were other young people , good ones , in the land . Lorna said , " Youth is saying , we want more freedom , we want no wars , we want all types of freedom of mind and body . But they 're not communicating , they 're not coming through to the people because they 're being destructive about it . They 're trying to tear down the memories that an older generation has built up . And it 's taken them years to build up this memory of a life that they had , the good times that they had , the loves that they had , the heartbreaks they had . It 's just like a mammoth scrapbook that they 've compiled . And they think that youth is coming in and gasolining everything and tearing it up . This is the problem . " The destructive youth was going to be met head-on by constructive young people . A minor crusade was under way . and infidels would be crushed by the stern boot of higher truth . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a patriotic recitation ( prepared by her uncle ) to " The Star-Spangle Banner , " no one was surprised . Out of forty-five , eight would be chosen . The semifinalists would all have the chance to do their acts live to the largest audience of any TV spectacu ? lar . Out of the forty-five , most were bad . Youth could not compensate for lack of talent and taste . lessness . The black girl came out dressed in black 100 and screamed her original monolog : " My mother 's dead ! Mother , come back ! Mother , you 're the only thing I ever loved ! " and so forth . Miss Puerto Rico recited her original poem ( written in English for the occasion ) about discovering faith in God . She was on her knees a lot of the time , looking up . ' There were baton twirlers , singers , dancers , two acrobats , monologists , and musicians . Kathy from South Dakota came in a long white shift , hare . foot , holding a red flower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale-gold brocade culotte outfit by Valentina . Miss Colorado Springs , Sylvia , wore a long brown skirt and cream shirt . and belted a folk-type song called " Get Together , " inserting into it an original poem . " Society , Why Do You Weep ? " Her hair was a sleek black skullcap and she was too good , we were all afraid . to be considered amateur . She was something else , something like a woman , and her stage presence made us all think she was a personality . Lorna did a Spanish dance , but ran over the two minute limit ; two girls did the bedroom scene from Romeo and Juliet and Miss Newport , Rhode Island , began her song medley with " Happy Days Are Here Again . " Two days later , after breakfast , the eight were announced . Miss Colorado Springs was among them . ( Lorna stopped smiling for twenty-four hours , and Kathy seemed relieved . ) The other semifinal. ists wept with joy : Miss Odessa , Miss Dallas , Miss Jacksonville , Florida ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Passionelia ) , Miss Denver , Miss Seattle ( a cellist ) , Miss Indianapolis , and Miss Los Angeles , who began her act saying , " Art is my talent and fashion is my interest , " before showing her three drawings and then sketching a fourth onstage . T he morning after talent judging , rehearsals be- gan for the telecast , No longer in the safety of the hotel , girls and chaperons had to tread the red carpet every morning to the Convention Center . The first morning , Miss Oklahoma City arrived five minutes late . Mr. Meeker announced she was out of the Pageant . The girl wept , explained to sympathetic stagehands that she 'd been waiting in the room for her chaperon , who had gone out to shop , returning a few minutes late . The girl 's cause was championed and thirty minutes later she was reinstated . The girls were learning how to kick and twirl flags under the tutelage of Judith Houghton , vice president and general manager of the corporation . Bobby Van , the dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was practicing with them . 13y afternoon the singing cadets would arrive , forty-six young men from Texas A &; M who , with the girls , would be dressed in red , white , and blue for the opening number and who would , from now until the Coronation Ball after the Pageant , be the girls ' escorts and accompany them and their chaperons to all meals and events . Though their grand entrance was scheduled for 4:00 P.m. , the cadets were not in evidence . I heardthey were going to he fitted before they entered , and entrance could be any time in the next two hours . Unfortunately , I could n't wait . I had a clandestine rendezvous arranged by a young waiter from TCU , whose father is in the Air Force ; he said he knew some kids interested in peace .

They went off to change . In the elevator I did n't register five hippie kids until one , handing me the white dove on a field of blue , asked , " You want a button , ma'am ? " They were cautious at first , and the lady journal . ist from New York posed disinterested questions ( " How many young people here sympathize with you ? " ) . They brought out the papers and leaflets . Within a few minutes , the interview was abandoned ; we relaxed on the floor with beer and Cokes .

The others were also under twenty . Patti was a silent little girl who seemed younger than eighteen and wanted only to be there , embarrassed by direct questions . Greg and Ron spoke heatedly ; Greg was a born debater , with small steel-rimmed spectacles and august sideburns . Their long hair and clothes made them all targets . They were not served in cafeterias ; they were threatened and jeered at . I said that I would join them on the Friday march . Patti promised to pick me up .

Mr. and Mrs. Legros greeted me and said I must come ; five minutes later I was down again , dressed in gold , moving fast but overtaken by Miss Odessa and her chaperon . Miss Odessa wore a green chiffon Empire dress with a tiny rhinestone belt . In place of greeting , she asked me on the run , " Am I overdressed ? Do I look all right ? " Tensely , she fussed with herself without missing a step and rushed in front of me through the door . We were seated at the same table and throughout dinner Miss Odessa spoke to no one . She gave the nearest cadet a look of malevolence and held herself as though made of china . To turn her head , she rotated her entire body ( the glue was n't reliable ) and she ate like a marionette , her blond hair resting perfectly on her shoulders .

Things today have to be carefully said , because we live in that kind of world where the truisms sound cornball . And people do not take time to understand that the values of the human being have not changed very much ? in three , four thousand years ? and eventually we come back to them . Now , Miss Teenage America has had some very rough times that I believe would have sunk it , and I believe it has survived because from the first minute I have been a self-appointed guardian of its integrity .

The Center cost only $16 million , and the same thing in New Haven , Lou assures me. would have cost $75 million . It 's a cocktail party , most people are from New York , and no conversation gets going . I spend a few minutes talking to the young man who designed the set ? enormous flats with cheery pastel flowers for which he charged CBS $42,000 . At 2:30 A.m . I prevail on my hostess to lend me a bathing suit and I go for a swim in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone is tired , and on the way back , acrimony settles in and the oversmoked , overdrunk occupants of the car are silent or bitchy . Next morning , the eight semifinalists are announced , the only ones to do their acts on TV . They 'll have special costumes , pink rhinestoned gowns , while the others arc in black and white ( and the cadets in dress uniform ) , so the press conference takes place in the dressing room . The other reporters are new to the girls and ask about the generation gap , the Moratorium , and drugs . Miss Denver tells us , " Happiness is a state of mind . " Miss Dallas says she found God during this week 's Pageant activities . Miss Seattle always had Him ; He brought her here after performing a miracle on her by which she lost twenty pounds through Weight Watchers . Her ambition is to become a Weight Watcher lecturer and serve as inspiration to other girls . All girls but one are familiar with drugs , which circulate in their schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addicts , trying to rehabilitate them . and her pride is a boy who was on heroin . One of the semifinalists had false lashes , false hair , and false breasts . A few had acne . They had agreed that teenagers who rebel lack personal strength and are lost . Some said they lack the power of prayer , and some , that they miss familial love . For whatever reason , it was weakness that led a person to protest his society . W e 've had calls last night and this morning , " V said Patti on Friday . " They tell us there 's going to be violence and there will be guns . " At 9:30 on the morning of November 14 1 did n't want to die . I was for peace , yes , and all good things , but not enough to be killed for it . This was Texas , people had guns and protested against registering them . Black armbands were illegal , kids had been kicked out of school for wearing the small peace button with a dove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dead men 's names in their casket . I had more protection than any of the Texans planning to march : I was older , from Nen York , and one of the CBS men was a lawyer . I tok Patti to wait , ran to the Convention Center to tel someone where I was and ask her to start doing something if I had n't reported back by 2 : 30 . In the car , Patti gave me a black armband and na drove to Trinity Park . This was the last time AD would have use of the car . Her father had con demned her for what she was doing , said if she user the car today she 'd never be able to drive it again At the park , kids were shivering and trying ti make posters . The 39-degree temperature wit strong winds came as a blast from on high after day in the seventies and eighties . Around a small fire some kids were warming their hands and Mik brought his mother to meet me . Mrs. Reznikoff wa dressed properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creetly made up and her coat well-tailored. " 1 ke1 the kids Clean for Gene , " she said , " but it 's nc worth it anymore . They 've got to look the way the do , it 's part of what they 're saying . " I was n't so enthusiastic about McCarthy , but he was the only one who came down here . We asked Bobby Kennedy , and he would n't come . We asked McGovern and be would n't come either . They said the time was n't right . McCarthy came , and that was the only way we could organize . " Someone came around with a petition ? " Any eligible draft-age boys have n't signed yet ? " Only they could sign . I suggested another petition for those who supported draft resisters , which could carry at least twice as many names as the first . Patti said they had n't thought of it but would do it next time . I asked to carry a poster and was given one saying , " Stop War . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unduly . An elderly woman carried a sign of " Life Against Death " and was delighted that I 'd read the book . " It 's the same thing , really , " she explained . " Freud 's view of life is antimilitaristie . Militarism is a form of death . " Site and I , Mrs. Reznikoff , and a handful of other women were the only participants over twenty-one . There were no members of the clergy , no men , no educators . This , today , was the first demonstration of any kind staged in Fort Worth . The October Moratorium passed and no one did anything . Since then , the kids had gotten together , using their own money to buy peace buttons , trying to sell them at 25 cents apiece . often giving them away and collecting only a few coins . The police escort drove up , about half a dozen motorcycles , and we prepared to march to the Federal Building where the names of draft resisters would be given to the Selective Service Board . We would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of Texas cops frightened me more . We walked , two abreast , about two hundred of us , for twenty or twenty-five minutes . The marshals were very strict in keeping us to the side ; traffic was not impeded and we walked silently , a solemn march , trying to hold on to posters in the brutal wind , not singing , making no noise , giving the peace sign whenever we saw people in cars or buildings . Most did n't react ; a few gave half the peace sign back , but more returned it fully and smiled . When we neared downtown , a soft chant began : over and over and over again . hushed , the monotonous incantation as the religious procession slowly makes its way to the final altar , At the Federal Building a man and woman , each with an American flag attached to his clothes , were distributing papers . The marshals called out ( they had been unable to procure bullhorns ) : " You do n't have to take it . But if you take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARE YOU GUILTY OF TREASON ? " the paper asked , and opened with ; " The ultimate goal of International Communism is complete control of the world ! " Most of us took it , folded it neatly , put it away . Not one piece of paper fell to the ground . There was no breaking of ranks and we continued ou r chant while settling ourselves in a close group on the concrete . Some reporters were there and the local TV station filmed is sporadically . We sat , a couple of American flags in the crowd , a few small patches of red , white , and blue attached to black armbands . On our left , a small group of women shouted obscenities at us . Nobody answered . Mike huddled in an oversized jacket , and Greg the Orator in steel-rimmed spectacles stood in front and told us they had 367 signatures on the petition . They asked for some people from TCU to accompany them in and while the committee formed , the rest sang " We Shall Overcome . " Another song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads still bent : " For forty-five thousand dead , for forty-five thou . sand dead .... " A man walked through the crowd , shouting that we were traitors . Someone answered , " Get the hats out of your heart , " and the group called , " Peace brother . " Then the committee returned , said thei had given the petition to the Board , had been lob it would be forwarded to Washington , and the of fivers said they did n't make policy , they just en forced it . Greg gave a small speech , saying that th. present rate of withdrawal means the war shoulu be over in twenty years . He said we must make our selves heard , that in the North we were a majority but here nobody knew about us . Then we picked out selves up to walk back . The motorcycle cops stage . close by , though they had not been ordered to , b ( cause they seemed to like us and wanted to kee an avuncular eye On things . The kids were elated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single violent incident . They ha spent last night in a candlelight vigil and man were high from lack of sleep . They stroked parkin meters , laughed , and jeered happily at each other " Hey , you long-haired hippie , get a haircut ! " " Yo there , go take a bath . " " No good Commie . " " Hipp . Commie bastard . " At the park , everyone was pleased and eontaine . I congratulated Mike . Greg , and Bucky. thanked me and promised to take me along ne : day in the motorcade to Dallas for the rally in Ferr Plaza . Patti let me off at the Convention Center . I r moved my armband , replaced my peace button wi the Honored Guest badge , and entered during a fu dress rehearsal of " It 's a Grand Old Flag " wi cadets and candidates . I told my friend I was oka and walked out under the loudspeaker blaring , " I ' a Yankee Doodle Sweetheart . " In the red carpet , I was abducted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young president of corporation that had owned Miss Teenage Ameri until last year and another man , an assistant Jerre 's who used so many aliases that he was knot simply as Beau Brummell . They put me in the ba seat of the car and announced we were going Popsicles . After a few minutes , we arrived at club . I had a double gin immediately and ask what they had heard about this morning 's mar " Nothing , " they said . " Nobody was there . The cold was too much for them . " I had another double and took out my black armband . Silence ; heads slightly shaking . I laughed . " Here you are , a musical-comedy team , always bright and cheery and all I have to do is show you this and you 're scared . You 're all looking at me as though I 'm a Commie . " I did n't care at that moment whether I 'd be refused entrance to the Pageant or not . Tomorrow they 'd be in rehearsal all day and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show on television . I 'd already seen most of what would be in it except the selection of the new queen . I could afford to launch a discussion on dissenters . The Women 's Liberation Movement , they said , was a bunch of lesbians . The Peace Movement was just kids who had no place to go . We talked more and it became clear that all three would like to get out of Vietnam as soon as possible , but none had known what the others thought and none would let the others know . The small eddy I made by plopping in their midst would close again , the surface would be as calm as before , but we all knew that these guys would vote differently than they were expected to I if the ballot was secret ) , and that , if they could n't live , at least they 'd let live . We parted on good terms . N ext morning Patti did n't have the car and we rode into Dallas with another demonstrator whom I shall call Anne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made the peace sign . Other cars and trucks went by with rifles placed next to the drivel , just a slip away from his right hand . Anne did n't want to make the peace sign ; she wanted to give the fist . A former SDS girl , she had come to Fort Worth from Austin because there was more to be done here and people had to be organized . She has a black boyfriend and is in danger . She 's been threatened . her car has been shot at , her tires slashed , her phone service revoked . No calls could come through or go out and when she got a new phone the same thing happened . Only after months , when she threatened to take the company to court , did her phone become operative . We passed a car from which the driver jabbed two fingers up at us . " Is that peace or fuck you ? " I asked . " Fuck you , " said Anne mildly . " Does he want to ? Would he . if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all about ? " " I do n't know . " She considered a while . Around here the original plan for the Moratorium was impossible to carry out . No one could go from house to house talking about the war because they 'd get shot . I recoiled from this . " Do n't tell me people would shoot a young girl corning to their house . I do n't believe it . " Silent Patti nodded in back . Anne said , " First of all , they would n't let you in . And then they would n't shoot you in their living room , you 'd be shot on the way home . " We talked of other hatreds ? the niggers and Jews ? and knew sex was in it somewhere . The longhaired boys who came to your house were there to rape your wife and daughter ; the free-living girls shamed their sex and forced each man to protect his womenfolk . Big cocks grew on all minorities ; they had grown on Jews , on blacks , and now were bulging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car and accepted flowers from young girls , to be later placed on the casket . Everyone was hungry and Bucky had fainted the night before because he had n't eaten for three days . I bought ten hamburgers and ten cokes , Greg tried to pay me with funds they still had ( $2.381 , but finally accepted the donation . On the lawn of Ferris Plaza , fifteen of us shared the food and watched two men with dark glasses and swastika armbands parade their identical signs : " Death to Red Scum . " A cup in the center looked through binoculars up at the large Dallas Hotel , a high wall of windows but all blank . We shrugged , lay back in the sun , and listened to speeches . About five hundred were there , at most , representing an area with two million inhabitants . We had our flowers , our Cokes , our black armbands , and the words from the microphone lazily circled us . There was much talk about the spirit of Jesus and the true meaning of America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CND insigne . Many girls wore crosses around their necks . Nothing much happened . The speeches ended , and high-school girls were singing " Where Have All the Flowers Gone ? " into the mike while we came up one by one to place our daisies on an empty , flag-covered casket . At seven in the evening another rally was planned , but I 'd have to be back at the hotel earlier to get ready for the Pageant . A carload of Fort Worth people was going back and said I could come along . David , the only black in the group , was driving . He was an elegant six foot three with a slim stretch of body and almost movie-star face , marred by delicacy . I was in back next to a young blond man who looked ill . He was stoned , there was no doubt , but the pallor had turned greenish and his lips were bloodless . He sat between me and a pretty eighteen-year-old , holding both our hands . We left him at his parents ' ? they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned him in ? and went to the pad of one of the girls . We got some beer I I had to buy it because I was the only one of age I , and we nibbled on tacos. cheese , and hits of chicken . We spread out on the floor and talked . Robert , a mustachioed , burly young man , came from Odessa , Texas . " It 's a town of 100,000 , all rednecks . I 'm a freak because I went to California when I was thirteen and I could see what was going on . " All these kids were going to Tarrant County Junior College in Fort Worth . They were there because tuition was very low , because they were n't sure yet what they wanted to do and thought it would be good to have some time , see if you could make it , and know before committing yourself that this was what you wanted . David has never been out of Fort Worth . No other blacks are involved in the movement , he said , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved and it 's just been a few years since they could start moving into the middle class . David spoke only after long rumination . An idea put forth half an hour earlier would return , fleshed , from his lips . He was taking a course in theology and gave us a short lecture on violence in religion . At three , he went out to get me cigarettes and came back breathless . A car had passed him and the men inside shouted , " Nigger . Black nigger . " David showed them his middle finger and they got out of the car . He ran . When David drives up to a filling station , all other customers are served before him , and if he 's the only car left , he may get gas . Violence is inappropriate . There are no Black Panthers here , and none will come down . When David joins his friends going to their parents ' houses ( to pick up mail , for instance ) , they are not allowed to come in and sometimes not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that 's how parents are , The white kids talk the way Northern liberals did a few years ago : " I was going with a black chick and everybody liked her . They did n't mind , she was such a nice person . " Nigger-lovers have n't been heard of yet . They took me in , told me stories ( how the freaks invaded the local radio station , about the Texas pop concert , about themselves , their parents , drugs ) and wanted me to stay long enough to see their freak room at college , where all the freaks listen to music and lounge around . Robert wants to go into advertising and public relations . David wants to go into radio and television , he wants to be where it 's at , and he knows it 's at communications . Melody , a very pretty ex-drama student , wants to go into sociology and psychology . They 're all getting a house together , about nine kids in a big house with no furniture . Melody had to leave home a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I must have been crazy or something because I said something about the Moratorium . I 've never talked to her about anything like that before . So she said I was a traitor to my country , and I told her I do n't feel that way , I think I 'm a patriot and that 's why I do this . So she said , ' America ? love it or leave it . If you do n't like the way it is , get out . ' And I told her , ' America ? change it or lose it ' . " All of them came along to drive me back to the Sheraton . They did n't know if they 'd get to Dallas again in the evening because they were low on gas . I removed my armband , put on my badge , and left . Then the cadets serenaded the live audience o about five thousand : At nine the telecast began . Opening number , wit a huge flag of cardboard squares held together b cadets ; then each girl introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , from X " ) , and two were give the Friendship and Leadership Awards . The other candidates had voted for them ; the first , choosin a girl they 'd most like as sister : the second , wh they thought should become the first woman Pres dent of the United States . Dick Clark , Master of Ceremonies . spent a minus or two with each of the eight semifinalists , chattin about their lives or ambitions . Miss Denver sai she wanted to meet Neil Armstrong so she coul ask him how he felt when he went to the moon . The Bobby Van danced to " Give My Regards to Broa ? way . " Miss Teenage America 1969 came clown long ramp in a cream-colored culotte suit and o fered gratitude to everyone who had allowed her tl opportunity of showing what an American really i The talent acts followed and four of the eight we chosen as finalists .

The tenseness of tl week , this year , her life , suddenly erupted , causi violence to her body , and she received the kiss fr ( the old queen across years of longing that were ni fulfilled . Five minutes later she posed with Mr. Meeker 1 photographers , posed with the other finalists , w her parents , and with Dr Pepper people holdi opened bottles of Dr Pepper toward her .
