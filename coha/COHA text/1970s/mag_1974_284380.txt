Residents of the wooded resort country round Big Moose , N. Y. ( population about 150 ) , awoke one morning last May to find they had some new neighbors . In the predawn hours , a band of Indians had taken over a 612-acre former girls ' camp , now a forest preserve in New York 's Adirondack State Park . They claimed the camp land and , thinking big , some 9 million additional acres in New York and Vermont , as Ganienkeh-the Land of the Flint , an independent Indian nation . Since then , to the frustration of state authorities and the growing anxiety of Big Moose 's white settlers , the Indians have refused to budge . The squat-in is fast approaching a legal crunch , and TIME Cor respondent Don Sider recently visited the Indian camp . His report : <P> The land is much as it must have been in colonial times , when the Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy held most of northeastern New York and portions of Vermont , Ontario and Quebec . The trees still whisper in the chill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . Yet the primeval peace is reguarly broken now by the roar of a silver Porsche gunning out of the camp gate onto Big Moose Road , heading for the Food Town market or the Laundromat two miles away . These are 20th century Indians , fired by the militancy that prompted the occupations of Alcatraz in 1969 and Wounded Knee in 1973 . They ride in cars toward their encounters with the white man . Their warriors are lawyers , who fight with manifestoes and 200-year-old treaties . But their aim is to return to the old ways . To do that they demand their ancestral lands . <P> For a while , New York State did nothing about the invaders , hoping that the problem-and the Indians- would simply go away . Only in September did the state go into federal court seeking to evict the Indians , basing its case on the fact that the Mohawks had been pro-British belligerents during the Revolutionary War and had later signed away their lands . The Indians reject that claim . " The Mohawk land was lost by fraud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vermont constituted illegal usurpation , " charges the Ganienkeh Manifesto . <P> Through the summer , the white community waited with waning confidence for state or federal officials to act . Meanwhile , the Indians planted corn , beans , potatoes and tomatoes and moved in a dozen head of cattle , as well as rabbits , pigs , chickens , ducks and geese . They felled trees to block the snowmobile trails that cross the camp and erected a tall tepee near the old camp gate . They barred all non-Indian visitors , courteously but firmly escorting out occasional vacationers who strayed onto the site . Their numbers were , and are , a mystery . By some estimates , they are as few as 30 ; by others , 90 or more , including women and children .
