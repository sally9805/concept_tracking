FAKE THOUSANDS of other energetic matrons whose children have grown out from underfoot , Mrs. Gloria M. Segal began to dabble in real estate . Typically , such dabblers end up as partners in a small agency , selling a couple of split-levels a month . Not Mrs. S. To her own bemusement , she now finds herself serving as den mother of a new town ? unlike any venture ever attempted here or abroad ? that eventually may house thirty thousand people . The first 1,300 residents were moving in this spring , but to complete the town Mrs. Segal and her associates expect to spend up to $30 million a year over the next two decades , some of it their own money . If this large , economy-size dabble works out according to Mrs. Segal 's dream , it could change the life-style of millions of Americans . For Mrs. Segal hopes to create not only better homes but a new kind of urban environment , a potential model for much of the building this country must undertake during the next half-century . ( It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Jane Jacobs and the Rolling Stones should love it . ) Even if it falls short ? and the risks are high ? its failures will provide some useful lessons for every American city . If some things do go wrong , it will not be for want of vision . Mrs. Segal has enough vision to outfit Joan of Arc , Joan Baez , and all of the Brook Farm utopians . H ER DREAM is taking shape on a hundred acres of run-down real estate at the eastern edge of Minneapolis . It is called Cedar-Riverside , after the two main streets that intersect there . It is the first new-town-in-town to be undertaken under the federal New Communities program . In looks , physical workings , and social patterns it will be quite different from any project you have ever seen . Item : 14 rich and poor families will live together in the same building and in similar apartments with nothing to show which family pays the maximum $500 a month rent and which pays the minimum $50 . Item : the project already has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance groups , leather boutiques , coffeehouses , and alternative-culture hangouts than any community I know of between Greenwich Village and San Francisco . Mrs. Segal enjoys that kind of scene and has invested considerable money and ingenuity in fostering it . A little raffishness , she feels , helps make a city exciting . The plan calls for a high-density community , packing in more living units ( about 120 per acre ) than do some congested sections of Manhattan . Yet it will ( so the vision goes ) offer light , air , architectural distinction , playgrounds , and safety from muggers , automobiles , and suburban boredom , plus all the cultural amenities of a great city , from swimming pools to art galleries . The residents will be a rich mix of ethnic groups ( including Indians , who are Minnesota 's most troubled minority ) , middle-class professionals and poor people , artists and housewives , students and businessmen , the young and the elderly . Most of them are expected to walk to work at the universities , hospitals , and offices close at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Others will travel via the Twin Cities rapid transit system , now in the planning stage ; or perhaps by " people movers " or " horizontal elevators " ? still only a gleam in Mrs. Segal 's wide brown eyes . Unavoidable auto traffic will be completely separated from pedestrians , who will move through a complex of plazas , parks , and covered walkways linking all buildings at second- and third-story levels . For women residents especially , living habits will change . Unlike the suburban housewife who spends much of her day chauffeuring children to school , doctors , and playmates , the young mother in Cedar-Riverside will have day-care centers , schools , and playgrounds within strolling distance in her own " neighborhood . " ( The community will be divided into five such " neighborhoods , " each with its own grocery , drugstore , laundry , and similar services . The first is now close to completion . ) A twenty-four hour health service will also be available in neighborhood clinics , sponsored by the nearby hospitals . For major shopping and recreation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Main Street and the classic Greek agora , at about the middle of the project . It will incorporate some of the better old buildings still standing for example , a nineteenth-century firehouse now converted into a neighborhood social center , and Dania Hall , an abandoned clubhouse of the same vintage , with a ballroom and theater . Two-way television , for which conduits are being laid as the buildings go up , could also change life-styles . " If you are not feeling well , " Mrs. Segal explained , " you can flick on your TV and report to the local health station . And you might do your shopping the same way . You could make up your grocery order from a list on the TV screen , a computer would register it , and in due course a box would appear at your door . " The same circuits might also be used for a community forum , among families relaxing in their own living rooms , or for reporting prowlers , or for surveillance of problem areas . Other technological innovations are less far-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant , developed in cooperation with two local utility companies , that can serve up to four thousand dwelling units , at low cost and with little or no environment pollution . To some observers , including myself , a lot of this sounds , well , visionary . The plans and models reminded me a little of Piranesi 's dream-structures or of the anthill-like " arcologies " fantasized by Paolo Soleri . I am not at all sure that life in such a compacted environment will turn out to be as cozy and joyous as the Cedar-Riverside brochures suggest . There is some evidence , admittedly inconclusive , that personal stress and antisocial behavior tend to increase in step with population density and that crime rates in apartment buildings go up in rough accordance with their heights . ( Some of the Cedar-Riverside structures will run to thirty and forty stories . ) MoreTHE EASY CHAIR over , the first apartments put on display to potential renters struck me as smallish , at least for families with a couple of children , though they might be fine for young singles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are too narrow to hold even a single chair . And from my own scant experience with computers , I would confidently expect a televised grocery order for a head of lettuce to produce a dozen nibs ' feet and a case of champagne . Plenty of other questions , financial as well as architectural and social , can not be finally answered for years. * Yet Mrs. Segal and her associates might just bring it off . Already they have accomplished things that any-sensible land developer would consider impossible : in the assembly of their land , for example , the relocation of its occupants , and the manipulation of some thirty-five city , state , and federal agencies , not to mention bankers and investors . On the record so far , I would not bet against Gloria on anything she really wants to do . HE RECORD BEGINS IN 1962 when , I as Mrs. Segal says , " I was looking for a tax-sheltered investment . " ( She likes to come on as a hard-nosed businesswoman because , I suspect , she is afraid her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , that idealism is her greatest asset , and she really is n't capable of concealing it . ) Her husband Martin , a prosperous but by no means wealthy doctor , went along *Both crime rates and the behavior of residents also are strongly influenced by the way a building is designed and sited . How this works is brilliantly demonstrated in a recent book , Defensible Space ( Macmillan , $8.95 ) by Oscar Newman , director of the Institute of Planning and Housing at New York University . Certain types of buildings notablythose put up in many public-housing projects ? are open invitations to muggers , burglars , and vandals . Other types , no more expensive and at least as pleasing aesthetically , are far safer and more pleasant to live in . This holds true not only for low-income housing but also for " luxury " apartments . In view of Newman 's findings it is hard to imagine anyone ever again building one of those **38;2932;TOOLONG beloved by Corbusier and other celebrated architects of his school . I am not sure how thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'm confident that they will take them into account in the designs of at least the later stages of their new town . 16 cheerfully , as he had with her earlier enthusiasms for music and for Democratic politics . He has never taken an active part , however , in her real estate ventures . On the advice of a friend , Keith Heller , who taught accounting and tax law at the University of Minnesota business school , she used $19,000 of the family savings to buy an equity in an aging apartment house . Once refurbished and refinanced , it yielded a comfortable return . At about this time Mrs. Segal was annoyed because she had a hard time finding parking places near the university concert hall . Heller suggested that she buy a vacant lot in CedarRiverside ? then a semi-slum where land was dirt cheap , but still within easy walking distance of the university by footbridge over the Mississippi . She did , and vastly enjoyed her private parking lot . She also wondered why it had come so cheap . Cedar-Riverside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred years ago by Scandinavian and Eastern European immigrants . ( Mrs. Segal 's uncle ran a grocery store there . ) But gradually it turned into a honky-tonk district , infested with lumberjacks on a spree , alcoholics , whores , and assorted burns . Cedar Avenue became known as Snoose Boulevard , after the Swedish word for the tobacco juice that splattered its sidewalks . As die stable families moved out , the population fell from 20,000 to 4,000 ; many of the old one- and two-story frame houses stood empty ; shops , except for the shabby bars , were mostly boarded up . On the other hand , the district lies just between the business centers of Minneapolis and St. Paul , both expanding rapidly . It is bordered by two new interstate highways . On its outskirts are two small colleges , two hospitals , and the giant University of Minnesota ? which in 1959 began to reach across the river to establish a new West Campus in Cedar-Riverside . A little later the city designated it as an urban renewal area and announced plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Segal and Professor Heller smelled a bargain . They decided to buy up a few more of those cheap lots and build a small apartment building , for rental to students , faculty members , and employees of the neighboring hospitals . l i/THEN THEY CONSULTED Ralph Rapson , mem head of the university 's architectural school , he did n't think much of the idea . " Peanuts , " he said . Why not buy up still more of the land while the going was good , then tackle something big -- like a housing complex of architectural distinction and real social value ? So Mrs. Segal remortgaged her original apartment house and used the money to buy additional properties . By this time she and Heller were partners in Cedar-B iverside Associates , Inc. , and gradually they brought in other investors , now totalling about fifty-five . The firm rehabilitated some of the old homes it bought , rented and remortgaged them , and put the proceeds into still more acreage , until it owned or controlled about 85 percent of the privately held property in Cedar-Riverside : in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original vision was growing like the fairy-tale beanstalk . Instead of building one dinky apartment , or even a housing complex , the Associates were now bent on creating a whole new town . It seemed prudent , i then , to bring in somebody who knew something , about new towns ? and about copin'g with the multitudinous arms of goVernment that inevitably would become involved . They turned to Henry T. McKnight , a former state senator , a Republican ( to offset the known liberalism of the Segal-Heller combo ) , a noted conservationist , the father of the state park system , a friend of Hubert Humphrey , a successful land developer ? and , most significantly , the founder of Jonathan , a new town abuilding about twenty-five miles southwest of Minneapolis . McKnight became chairman of Cedar-Riverside Associates , with Heller I who had left his university job ) as president and Mrs. Segal as vice-president and cheerleader . From then on the enterprise proceeded as ' a curious partnership between the Associates and government . They never tried to fight city ball . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council passed twelve new ordinances on a single day , June 4 , 1971 , to loosen the straitjacket of zoning and building codes . To direct the planning . the Associates brought in Donald A. Jacobson , who had many years of similar experience with the Minneapolis Housing and Redevelopment AuthorTHE EASY CHAIR ity . A former mayor , Arthur Naftalin , became a consultant . Their know-how in dealing with government ? and McKnight 's ? made possible the intricate arrangements for financing the project . The key to it is a $24 million guarantee to private investors under the federal New Communities program , but the project also taps half a dozen other sources of public funds , local and national , including rent subsidies for low-income families . In similar fashion , every step in the planning is being worked out hand in hand with public agencies , from the state highway department to the university . I RBAN RENEWAL has become a hateful term in many cities , because it has so often meant the destruction of existing neighborhoods and the uprooting of thousands of poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of the sort would happen in Cedar-Riverside . Of the 150 people they have had to move so far , all but two have been resettled within the community ? in better quarters and with no increase in rents . This was possible because the Associates had bought up nearly all the old homes in the area , many of them vacant , and had rehabilitated them for this express purpose . By the time the last of them is torn down , twenty-five years from now , all the residents will have had a chance to move into the new buildings . Meanwhile they are being handled with extraordinary tact . A case in point is that of the Sixteen Old Men . They had lived together for years in an old frame house . When its site had to be cleared , they were offered apartments in a housing project for elderly people that already had gone up a few blocks away . " Hell , no , " they said in effect . " We do n't want to move into that coop full of chattering old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are used to each other , and we are used to our own home , such as it is . " So Mrs. Segal came up with an alternative plan that they accepted with gratitude . One night they all went to a hotel for dinner , a party , and an overnight stay , at the Associates ' expense . Next morning they went back to their old house , where they found everything in its accustomed place , down to the last beer bottle . But the house had been moved during the night to new foundations on a vacant lot a few hundred feet down the street ; for them the only change was the view . Such delicacy perhaps accounts for the fact that the Associates , landlords for four thousand people , have never had a rent strike or used a rent collector . " All rents come in over the counter or in the mail , " Mrs. Segal said , " and we have less than 1 percent uncollected . That 's fantastic . " Another reason for their comfortable relationship with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have made thernse/ ? es part of the community . Their unpretentious office is in the middle of it , in what used to be an ice-cream factory . Mrs. Segal is accessible to anybody with a question , a gripe , or an idea for the project ; and many of her evenings are spent discussing plans and problems with neighborhood groups . If a student commune wants to repaint its house with purple flowers and green peace symbols ? as several of them have ? she comes up with paint and brushes the next morning . T HE BEST OMEN for the future of the project is the quality of its planning . In the early stages Mrs. Segal visited many new towns in Europe . At Tapiola in Finland , one of the most widely praised new communities , she snared its founder , Heikki von Hertzen , to serve as a part-time consultant . Gradually she added to the planning team a dozen other firms and individual consultants ? specialists in engineering , architecture , environmental design , economics , energy systems , and sociology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but competent , they have produced an extraordinarily imaginative basic plan . To judge from scale models and the construction already under way , it will he visually exciting , with none of the sterile monotony that deadens so many other large-scale housing enterprises , such as Co-op City in New York . It incorporates novel and apparently farsighted solutions for many urban problems , ranging from the best use of a river hank to ( in Mrs. Segal 's phrase ) " the psychological effect of planting ten thousand tulip bulbs . " Although people like me , who crave a good deal of soliclaustrophobic , I am sure that for others Cedar-Riverside will be both stimulating and conducive to a sense of community . Mrs. Segal herself believes that its appeal will vary at different stages in a person 's life . Single and young married people may especially enjoy its teeming social life . When their children conic along , they may prefer to move to Jonathan or sonic other suburban environment ; and when they near retirement , they may want to move back to Cedar-Riverside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of somber omens too.One of them was the Nixon Administration 's cutback last January of federal housing and rent-subsidy programs . It probably will not much affect the present stage of the Cedar-Riverside development , for which funding is already committed , but unless new government money begins to flow again within a year or so , the future stages may be hard to finance . Another was the death last winter of Henry McKnight , after a brain-tumor operation . I ca n't judge what his loss as chairman will mean to the Associates , but his special combination of business and political acumen obviously will be missed . How the project will turn out as a business venture is another open question . Informed outsiders told me that Mrs. Segal 's equity is now probably worth something more than $1 million : an adequate , shall we say , rate of growth from her original $19,000 investment eleven years ago . On the other hand , it will be decades ? " perhaps not in my lifetime , " as she says ? before it begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on such imponderables as the occupancy rate and operating costs . So too with the value of the physical investment . If building costs continue to escalate at 12 percent a year every brick laid today could look golden in twenty years ? provided , of course , that thirty thousand people actually will want to live in Cedar-Riverside when it is completed . Mrs. Segal gave me the impression that she could n't care less about how much money she stands to make . Her real reward is the glorious fun she is having right now , in building a laboratory for urban living . Its lessons , for good or bad , will begin to flow long before the cash return .
