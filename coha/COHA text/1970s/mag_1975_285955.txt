" Who steals my purse steals trash , " said Shakespeare , but who steals my trash-ah , that can be a treasure of sorts , at least for the imaginatively trashy National Enquirer . Under orders from his editors , Reporter Jay Gourley , 27 , lifted five green plastic bags of refuse from in front of the Georgetown home of Nancy and Henry Kissinger and put them in the trunk of his 1968 Buick . Alert Secret Service agents and police promptly swooped down on him , and it took 21/2 hours of argument before Gourley convinced them that the trash by law constituted abandoned property and was there for the taking . <P> Gourley later sorted his haul and deduced that Henry or Nancy or both 1 ) smoke Marlboros , 2 ) use patent medicines , and 3 ) sometimes throw away the New York Times unopened . He is saving other weighty conclusions for a treatise the Enquirer is doing this week . Says Gourley , " There are things in Kissinger 's trash that I think he would rather people did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive material from the Secretary 's Georgetown jetsam before it reaches the curb . The State Department , however , announced that Nancy was " anguished " and the Secretary " really revolted . " The home-town Washington Post decried Gourley 's trash-can investigation as " indefensible-both as journalistic-practice and as civilized behavior . " Later in the week a Palm Beach , Fla. , Post reporter pawed through garbage bins at the National Enquirer 's headquarters in nearby Lantana and came up with a revealing two-year-old memo from Publisher Generoso Pope Jr . exhorting his troops : " Prod , push and probe the main characters in the story . Help them frame their answers . Ask leading questions like ' Do you ever go into the corner and cry ? ' "
