CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA <P> by GEORGE BERNARD SHAW <P> Caesar and Cleopatra is afflicted by the mummy 's curse . Despite two or three of the best scenes in the Shavian canon , the play itself may be unworkable : lines by Shaw but construction by Rube Goldberg . Offstage there are battles , mob scenes and the endless clumping of Roman legions . Onstage there are only words ; even in this finger exercise for Pygmalion Shaw seemed to be heading toward what he later called playwriting as a " platonic exercise . " <P> An imaginative production might have rescued the good and masked the bad in this 80-year-old drama . Director Ellis Rabb reverses that equation , how ever ; his Caesar and Cleopatra is as dull as it is dutiful . Scenes change with astonishing rapidity , but the action seems regulated by an hourglass - an illusion whose secret is best left with Rabb and the Sphinx . Ironically , the one liberty the director has taken , a vigorous pruning to keep the play within two hours , makes Shaw 's needlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costumes , which cost $300,000 , are a dazzling plus . But the acting is , surprisingly , no more than competent . Elizabeth Ashley is a vital Cleopatra - half alley cat , half Queen - but more Shakespeare 's lady of the Nile than Shaw 's . Rex Harrison 's Caesar is a burnt-out case who does not seem to remember what it was like to be warm - let alone what it was like to be Caesar . Gerald Clarke
