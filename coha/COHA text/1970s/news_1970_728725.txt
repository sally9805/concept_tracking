txt A conference of young advisers to the Selective Service System recommended today that the draft age be lowered to 18 , that student deferments be eliminated and that an all-volunteer force ultimately be created . The proposals were included in a set of recommendations to Dr. Curtis W. Tarr , director of Selective Service . The suggestions were made by the National Selective Service Youth Advisory Committee at the end of five days of debate and deliberations here . On the committee were 109 advisers , including eight women , ranging in age from 16 to 26 . The advisers , generally clean-cut in appearance , had been selected by state draft directors and their youth advisory committees . Dr. Tarr told the young people in a brief response that he agreed with a number of their suggestions and had begun moving toward some of them . He said , for example , that a new memorandum on conscientious objectors was being prepared that would present no serious conflict with the committee 's recommendations on this subject . The committee proposed the establishment of a " registrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases . It also recommended that local boards do more research on the personal background and history of applicants . Later today , Dr. Tarr announced that the top limit for draft calls in August would be number 195 in the draft lottery . The number is only five higher than the limit set for July draft calls , and Dr. Tarr said it would not go much beyond that level the rest of the year . Dr. Tarr reaffirmed previous instructions to draft boards not to call men with numbers higher than 215 for pre-induction physicals . Most of the more significant proposals , such as creation of the all-volunteer force and elimination of student deferments , would require legislation . Other suggestions , however , such as lowering the draft age from 19 to 18 , could be ordered by the President . Dr. Tarr promised prompt consideration of the proposals , and a Selective Service spokesman said : " I think the attitude is that , if it is implementable and reasonable , we 'll do it . " Volunteer Force Backed Dr. Tarr reiterated his support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan might not enlist sufficient volunteers . Thus , he said , a stand-by draft might be required . On another topic of controversy , the conference opposed by a vote of 67 to 19 , with two abstentions , deferments on the basis of opposition to a specific war . " Granting such a deferment would be inconsistent with the standards and original purpose and defition of the C.O. classification , " the majority contended . Dr. Tarr later commented that it would be " virtually impossible to run a system of conscription together with a system of selective conscientious objection . " Charles Mathews. a 22-year-I old law student at Loyola Uni-I versity of Los Angeles . served as chairman of the conference . In presenting the recommendations , he said they had been arrived at after " considerable debate and some heated exchange . " He added , " we came here constructively to build , not to destroy . " The delegates included high school students , college students , Vietnam veterans and others . They were predominantly white and , according to a questionnaire filled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " blue collar " families . In the questionnaire , two delegates called themselves " radicals " and one was a self-styled " reactionary . " Most of the others called themselves either " liberals " or " middle-ofthe-roaders . " " I would not claim that they represent a really accurate cross section of American youth today , " a high Selective Service official said . Two Minority Reports Several conference delegates said the issue of selective conscientious objection had provoked the most acrimonious debate , as well as a minority report . Another minority report was filed on the endorsement of an all-volunteer force . The minority said that the majority position had been adopted after only 10 minutes of discussion in plenary session . In recommending elimination of student deferments , a step the Administration has proposed but that is stalled in Congress , the advisers ' report said the present situation favored the rich and intelligent . In urging a lowering of the age of draft vulnerability , the advisers proposed that the lottery drawing to determine who shall be drafted be applied to those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A man would then be aware of his sequence number at an earlier age so as to better enable him to plan his future , " the report said . The oung delegates also sug ? gested phasing out deferments for divinity students , because they said , religious objections to military service are protect . ed under conscientious objet tor regulations . Dr. Tarr said however , that it would be " very difficult " to get Congressionall approval for such a move . A certain impatience with potential draftees who try to defeat the system by " manipulating " it was reflected in a series of recommendations on " manipulation of the draft . " Generally , the proposals challenged the system to eliminate " loopholes in its laws " and asked for more intensive use of field attorneys to enforce the laws . They suggested , for example , that Selective Service require more positive proof of residence than just a mailing address before approving an application for transfer of induction .               @ @ @ @ @ @
