 | The Huskies -- and pick one A group of Washington oarsmen stood in front of a TV set last Saturday following the Pac 8 rowing championships in Seattle , cheering as they watched Affirmed win the Preakness . They were as excited about that as they had been all day , which seemed odd , because they had just beaten California in a thrilling race , the Huskies ' 24th win in 27 meetings with their archrivals over the past 11 years and a victory that capped their first undefeated season since back in 1973 . The reason for the comparative lack of exuberance over their own triumph , as stroke oar Mike Hess said , was that " We were expected to win . " Crew will never challenge the Preakness for network time , which in this case is in some ways unfortunate . Had the media paid a little more attention to rowing earlier in the day , Hess might have been less excited by the horse race and more by Washington 's rowing feat . A few thousand miles east of Seattle , on Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second biggest surprise of the 1978 collegiate rowing season . And that left Washington the only undefeated college crew in the country . Once , Dartmouth over Yale would have drawn a ho and a hum . But that was before 1978 , the season of Washington 's dominance in the West and chaos in the East . The story is complicated , and full of unexpected twists and turns . Early in April , Harvard , perennially a rowing colossus , had come West and finished fourth at San Diego in a race won by Washington . But because of the tough winter , the Crimson had trained hardly at all , and they went on to leave Syracuse , Brown , Princeton and Penn in their wakes , seemingly the Harvard of old . As always , the Crimson were peaking for the big one , the Eastern Sprints of two weeks ago , at which they were looking for their fifth straight victory . Fourteen other crews were waiting on Lake Quinsigamond at Worcester , Mass. ; second place would be a prize for any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-boat finals . But so was Yale , making it that far for only the second time in its last 10 tries . When the race was 20 strokes old , Yale was even with Syracuse and ahead of everyone else . At 400 meters the Yale boat had five seats on Harvard , and at 500 meters Eli coxswain Andrew Fisher called , @# " Take a concentration 10 , " a Yale term which means : for 10 strokes clear your mind . Fisher glanced anxiously to starboard , momentarily expecting to catch a glimpse of crimson shirts , but he saw none . At 1,000 meters , a crucial point in the race ? Fisher had said , " That 's when Harvard blew my freshman boat off the water " ? he saw Harvard edging up . " Oh God , here they come , " he kept thinking . But they did n't . A sudden gust of wind scudded into the Yale boat , and its rhythm faltered for a moment . Fisher , his eyes flickering sideward , called , " Relax , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stern and Harvard 's bow . The next 90 seconds , Fisher knew , might be worth recalling 50 years from now , if only he could keep his concentration . Yet it was impossible for him not to think of Harvard-Yale ? and all that meant ? and rowing , the oldest of American intercollegiate sports . The Elis had not beaten the Crimson in a heavyweight race for 15 years . The stroke watch read 35 at 1,500 meters . Fisher called , " Take it up one , " and at 1,750 , " Harvard 's coming on , take it to 37 . " But Harvard was a length back , and then three-quarters back as Yale crossed the finish line . There was some " fierce hugging , " as the Yalies put it , in the boat . Few college oarsmen ever felt better about themselves . As Washington was tops in the West , Yale was No. 1 in the East . The euphoria around New Haven lasted just one week . Was overconfidence responsible for the disaster thvertook the Elis at Syracuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be explained , " said Yale crew manager Steve Seifert . Dartmouth , which had failed to make the finals of the Eastern Sprints and had beaten only Wisconsin this year , left Yale two lengths behind in the morning race . In the afternoon the Eastern crew season continued true to form . Morning giant killer , Dartmouth , went out against Syracuse and lost . So , you figure out Eastern precedence . Back in Seattle , the Huskies were attending to business : covering phone receivers with shaving cream , treating vis-@#  | itors to their docks to unexpected swim in Lake Washington ? " Lake shots , " t call it ? and winning races : three of t five Pac 8 women 's events and all six the men 's that they entered . The Cal race was thrilling because it was so closely contested and because it could be watched from the two best places in the world to view a crew race , a bridge spanning the 200-foot-wide Montlake Cut 70 feet above the 1,700-meter mark , and from the Cut 's high banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the snow-cox - ered Cascade Mountains 50 miles to the east , and then enter the Cut for the last 750 meters . From the bridge , they appear to be exquisitely wrought toys . Cal , the lighter crew , got off to its usual fast start , rowing 40 strokes a minute for the first 500 meters . Entering the Cut . at 1,250 meters , Washington was fix e seats down . Approaching the bridge . with Cal barely ahead , Washington cox John Stillings suddenly seemed to go berserk , calling out , " Sprint now . . . up two ... open it up ... pull the cork ... , " all in rapid succession . As the Huskies emerged from under the bridge they had taken the lead , by a foot or so . Stillings let them know , yelling , " Half a seat . . . a seat . . . half a seat . . . a seat , " subtracting a little from the actual lead , afraid his crew might let up , even for an instant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second ahead of Cal and eight seconds in front of Oregon State . Mike Hess gasped , " Did we win ? " " Yes , " Stillings replied , and Hess fell backwards . He spent most of the next 20 minutes there , holding a wet towel to his head . " Everything was hurting , " he said later . " I was never so close to running on empty . " Washington Coach Dick Erickson. who is being called the Admiral these days , was puffing his ubiquitous pipe . drinking his endless stream of coffee and saying , " I 'm under a lot of strain . When you 're on top , you 've got to keep picking winning boats . " In July he will take his men back to England 's Henley Royal Regatta , where the Huskies are defending champions . California will go to next month 's IRA in Syracuse , which it won in 1976 . Wisconsin , which almost beat Harvard in the qualifying heats of the Eastern Sprints , could be tough there , too . As Erickson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sport . You just never know . "
