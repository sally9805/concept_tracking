txt On the ninth floor of a modern Washington building , Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski held a series of unusual meetings with top aides Monday , in his office . At the same time , lawyers for the six defendants in the coming Watergate cover-up trial planned a joint meeting , this newspaper has learned , to discuss legal strategy . This , too , shaped up as an unusual meeting , since each defendant has his own separate team of lawyers .  - -  5th meetings were being held as a direct response to President Ford 's sweeping pardon on Sunday of former President Nixon . At issue were several possible ramifications of the pardon : ? The Watergate cover-up trial of the six former top Nixon aides ? how would it be affected ? It is widely thought again to allow time for legal maneuvers by either prosecutors or defense attorneys . Originally scheduled to open Sept. 9 , the trial now is to begin Sept. 30 . On Sunday a spokesman for the prosecutor insisted the pardon would have no effect on the prosecution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to begin the trial Sept. 30 . By Monday morning , however , the prosecutor 's office would say only that there would be no comment on the subject . ? Would defense attorneys immediately petition President Ford for similar pardons for their clients , on grounds they merely had been carrying out Mr. Nixon 's orders and he has been pardoned ? One possibility being discussed in Washington was that defense lawyers might seek some form of blanket pardon for all six defendants . Presidential Counsel Philip W. Buchen insisted Sunday that so far as he knew President Ford had given no thought to pardoning these defendants , nor to pardoning others charged with Watergate-related crimes , or already serving jail sentences . Reports circulated Reports began to circulate around Washington that President Ford was unlikely to issue a blanket pardon , holding that aides to Mr. Nixon would have to be responsible for their own decisions ; these reports could not be confirmed . ? Will the pardon of the former president result in prejudicing the case against his six former aides ? It is widely believed such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who will charge that a pardon implies guilt by the former president and , by his association , guilt by his aides who are accused of similar cover-up activities . - Will Mr. Jaworski and his staff eventually draw up a public bill of particulars listing offenses they believe Mr. Nixon committed ? Such a list was drawn up in the case of former vice-president Spiro T. Agnew , as part of the agreement whereby Mr. Agnew resigned the vice-presidency. // *Watergate 6 ' strategy // In an initial reaction , a Jaworski aide Sunday did not anticipate such a list would be made . But later in the day , Mr. Buchen left the door open to one , saying that Mr. Jaworski could do anything he wanted regarding the former president ? except , of course , that he could not prosecute . ? Will Mr. Jaworski or his top aides react publicly to their having been shut out of the decisionmaking process which led to the pardon ? if so , what will they do ? Jaworski aides confirm that presidential counsel Buchen has said publicly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon , and that he was notified it would be granted only half an hour before the public announcement . Even then , say Jaworski aides , Mr. Jaworski was not asked his opinion , nor did he give it . Negotiations traced Mr. Buchen says that his office made the initial contact with the former president concerning a different subject ? ownership and control of the controversial Nixon tapes and other documents . At that time , Mr. Buchen said , he made it clear that if Mr. Nixon wanted to discuss other subjects ? such as possible pardon ? he would have to initiate such discussion . And he did . Pardon negotiations lasted one week , and were conducted between the Buchen office and the former president , Ronald L. Zeigler , and Nixon lawyer Herbert J. Miller . There was one go-between ? Washington attorney Benton L. Becker ; on behalf of Mr. Ford he went last Thursday to San Clemente to tell Mr. Zeigler and Mr. Nixon that President Ford probably would pardon his predecessor . This newspaper has confirmel reports that Mr. Becker himself has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? he says he is not guilty of wrongdoing . When news of Mr. Becker 's role in the pardon process became public over the weekend , the U.S. Attorney 's office in Washington , D.C. , sent the information accumulated on his case to the Justice Department , which would have to consider whether to prosecute . A source close to the President has told this newspaper that Mr. Ford " must have been all atone " in his decision to pardon Richard Nixon ? that all of the Ford inner circle of advisers were against such a move . This long-time Ford friend said : " I had just come off the golf course when I heard about it ? and I was appalled . I had been asked by the President to provide my views on the subject . I opposed pardon until court action had run its course ? and I had told Jerry how I felt . " Further , I know that all of the top Ford staff , including the Hartmanns , Buchens , Marshes , and others were opposed to this immediate pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the Lairds , the Byrnes , and the others . " Perhaps the old Nixon holdovers ? like Haig ? were for this action . But not the Ford staffers . " Therefore I can only conclude that the President decided this by himself . " Undoubtedly someone painted a dramatic picture of what all this was doing to Richard Nixon ? that there was no telling where his depression might lead ? and the President thought this was the compassionate thing to do . I do n't see how there could be any other explanation . " Elsewhere , from within the Ford staff , there were similar comments . " The timing of this Nixon pardon was so fantastically bad , " a presidential aide told this reporter , " that I could hardly believe it . " Big gamble ' seen " The President had to know there would be a widespread negative reaction . He had to know he was taking a terribly big gamble . " Why ? Why ? I kept asking myself when I heard this was coming a few hours in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President is being second-guessed today for his Nixon pardon by those who normaily are complete Ford loyalists . Meanwhile , the White House announced President Ford wants more time to consider the details on conditional amnesty for Vietnam draft dodgers and deserters . Mr. Ford still favors case-by-case review , but has been preoccupied for the last 72 hours with the pardon for Mr. Nixon , a spokesman said . Jerald F. terHorst , President Ford 's highly respected press secretary , backed up his protest of the pardon by resigning , asserting that the move violated his belief that no man should be above the law . // *Why Nixon pardon now .. . // But the Ford aides ' comments also underscored the big question here and across the nation : Why did the President take this step when ( a ) at vice-presidential confirmation hearings he had ruled out such action ( " I do n't think the public would stand for such a pardon " ) and ( I ) ) only a few days before he had indicated he would let the Nixonrelated legal charges run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationale for the action ? although , he too , had questions about the timing : " My inside information is that the Philip Buchen comment is correct ( Mr. Buchen Is counsel to the President . That is , if you know a man Is going to walk the plank and you know that you are going to keep him from jumping ? why not prevent the whole thing before the man has taken a single step ? " I think that the President , for reasons that he has stated healing the country and his conviction that Mr. Nixon could not get a fair trial decided that he would issue a pardon at some point . Then he decided ? why prolong the cruelty ? Why not issue a pardon right away ? " When this aide was asked : " But how about the President 's men who have been penalized or will be penalized by the courts for Watergate . related events ? Why did n't the President take them into consideration ? " The answer was : " I honestly do n't think he thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had . " Another sympathetic view of the President 's action focuses on the comment by Mr. Ford that the uncertainty over Mr. Nixon 's future was hurting his health . thus , the rationale for the Ford action goes like this : " He was persuaded by former President Nixon 's close associates that this Inwending court action was destroying Mr. Nixo ; ! ' s health ? perhaps even killing him . Thus , out of compassion , he acted ? and acted quickly . " The m ( 4t caustic assessment of the ? President 's action comes down hard on the view that there was a Ford-Nixon " deal " ? that Mr. Nixon would give Mr. Ford the presidency in return for a full pardon . Mrs. Martha Mitchell says she believes the whole thing had been prearranged : " I knew Nixon had something up his sleeve when he left the White House , " she says . Other criticism runs along the lines of " bad presidential judgement " ? stressing the inequity , as these critics see it , of Mr. Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must continue to face court action . Meanwhile , if the President hoped to put Watergate behind him with his decision , early reactions , both here in Washington and around the nation , were proving him wrong . Perhaps Mr. Ford should have anticipated there would be a tremendous stir : a new Newsweek magazine poll says 68 percent of Americans opposed amnesty for Mr. Nixon , with only 33 percent favoring it .
