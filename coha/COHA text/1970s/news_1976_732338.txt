txt Former Gov . Jimmy Carter of Georgia and Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana , two country boys grown into Presidential candidates , appeared to hold the lead today on the eve of Iowa 's Democratic precinct caucuses . In the final week of campaigning in this first test of strength of the 1976 campaign , in a state whose vast agricultural bounty helps to feed the nation and the world , both Mr. Bayh and Mr. Carter stressed their continuing ties to the soil . The Senator told a television interviewer here in northwest Iowa yesterday how much he missed his farm near Shirkieville , Ind . Earlier in the week , the former Governor explained in Fort Madison in southeast Iowa how he had learned " love // Carter and Bayh Appear to Hold Lead on Eve of Iowa 's Caucuses for Selection of Democratic Delegates No more than 10 percent of Iowa 's 455,000 registered Democrats are expected to participate , a circumstance that has led those who do not expect victory to denigrate the whole enterprise . Sargent Shriver , for example , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly clear indication of what Iowa Democrats feel , let alone the whole electorate . " But that has not prevented Mr. Shriver and five rivals ? Mr. Carter , Mr. Bayh , Representative Morris K. Udall of Arizona , Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington and former Senator Fred R. Harris of Oklahoma  --  from investing a total of 85 campaign days and $125,000 in their campaigns in the state . The candidates have answered endless questions from the voters in this politically sophisticated state , whose voting patterns have come to re Semble those of its northern neighbors , Wisconsin and Minnesota . In a single session , Mr. Carter fielded queries about Angola , gun control , abortion , inflation , early childhood devel-1 opment , grain sales , picketing , and marijuana . But no really deep cleavages1 have appeared , and the electorate seemed to focus more on personalities , even after the state Democratic Party mailed more than 20,000 copies of // of country , love of land , love of God , " back home in Plains , Ga . Tomorrow 's 2,530 caucuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Democratic National Convention  --  not a particularly large block  --  and they are only a first step . But they will provide some early clues to the standing of the candidates , with dividends in money , volunteers , morale and media attention for those who do well . Only 10% of Votes The New York Times/Dana Downie Senator Birch Bayh on the phone in Des Moines yesterday morning as his press secretary , Bill Wise , finished taking notes in the kitchen area of the Senator 's motel room . issue summaries to activists . Mr. Carter started earliest , visiting the state last February as an almost totally unknown quantity . Before the others knew what was happening , he built up a strong lead that he has never relinquished , in the view of Iowa politicians . Mr. Bayh , capitalizing on a network of trade union supporters , has closed the gap in recent weeks , winning straw polls in Sioux City and Waterloo . Mr. Carter has left the state but Mr. Bayh is still here ; he will be at a John Deere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be bunched well behind the leaders : Mr. Udall , the disappointment of the campaign , who once expected to win here ; Mr. Harris , who pulled things together in the final weeks , and Mr. Shriver , whose unfocused campaign was the most difficult to evaluate . " It 's a mile race , " said Toni Whitney , the state Democratic chairman . " Carter ran the first 440 all alone , and it 's hard to catch up if he does n't fall . He did n't fall . " But a victory for Mr. Carter here could prove hollow . Canvassers for all the candidates found as many as 60 percent of the Democrats undecided last week , and many politicians predicted an uncommitted vote well in excess of the 35.8 percent recorded in 1972 . If it is large enough , it could suggest that no candidates have caught on . Mr. Whitney , a handsome and energetic young professional who wants to run for governor , thinks most of those who are undecided will stay home , reducing the uncommitted vote . Noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither of whom gave much time to Iowa , and that there was no organized uncommitted movement this year like the one in 1972 , he estimated the uncommitted total at no more than 25 percent . In any event , it is clear that some of the candidates have reached people who have never before participated in the caucuses . Floyd Gillotti , a wheelhorse in Des Moines politics who has worked in 23 primaries there , tells of attending a Carter meeting at which he knew only 4 out of 160 people . Little G.O.P. Excitement No such excitement has been produced by the Republican caucuses , which will also take place tomorrow night . Republicans tend to remain uncommitted in the early stages of their delegate-selection process in Iowa , although a straw poll may give some indication of the relative standing here of President Ford and former Gov . Ronald Reagan of California . Mr. Ford , backed by most of the party hierarchy , has not campaigned in the state . Mr. Reagan spoke at a Des Moines airport rally before 250 people yesterday , flailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Mr. Carter , as dark a horse as any who ever ran , the Iowa campaign has already provided a measure of credibil-I ity . His success has been com-I pounded by support from the United Automobile Workers ; ' superb organizational work by Timothy Craft , his local coordinator ; his farm background , and a style that seems well suited to an era of pervasive cynicism about politics . His speeches all across Iowa have been peppered with phrases such as " I would n't want to mislead you , " " I wo n't ever lie to you , " and " I do n't pretend to know all the answers . " And he consistently reminds audiences that " there has n't been a farmer in the White House since Thomas Jefferson . " Support From Aunt The unusually religious character of this state has also played a role in his rise from obscurity . Mr. Carter 's aunt , 1Ruth Stapleton , who publishes an evangelistic news letter , has recruited substantial numbers of Democrats for the caucuses . The former Governor may also receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told The Catholic Mirror , the Des Moines diocesan newspaper , that he supported " a national statute " to prevent abortion  --  an ambiguous statement seemingly in conflict with his earlier comments opposing a constitutional amendment on the subject . Timothy McCarthy , executive director of the Iowa Catholic Conference , said that " Mr. Carter would be helped " if Catholic priests ' efforts to stir interest in the caucus suc ? ceeded . But in the longer run he may be hurt if the abortion episode erodes his reputation as a politician who talks straight . Mr. Bayh , who is trying to demonstrate his ability to restore the old New Deal coalition , said that his judgment of the race was that he " would win , if there were a few more days . " Seems on Defensive He has occasionally appeared to be on the defensive , as when he spoke in a union hall in Waterloo festooned with Carter posters . He admitted in an interview to being " frustrated " by the U.A.W. 's backing of the Georgian , whom he described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor issues . Yet his campaign , on this final weekend , was clearly the most active . Appearing on local television broadcasts . Senator Bayh showed himself a gifted performer , speaking squarely to the camera in well organized sentences about economic problems . And he benefited from the " Hoosier horde " - 200 Indianians who drove to Iowa on Friday to campaign door-todoor for the Senator . Out-of-State Volunteers Mr. Udall spent 12 days in the state , winding up with a six-day , 1,879-mile bus trip that had the earmarks of a last-gasp effort . But he never seemed to find a constituency , and his campaign manager , Norma Matthews , scaled her predictions down from first place last summer to " in the top two " this fall to " somewhere in the pack " the other evening . Even Mr. Udall 's 30-second television commercials seem to make little impact . After Mrs. Matthews said publicly that Mr. Carter " looks and sounds like Richard Nixon , " Mr. Whitney end other observers here said that the Udall campaign was " floundering . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the last two weeks here , pulled in volunteers from California , Colorado , New Jersey and Massachusetts for a final effort to put his antiprivilege campaign across in Iowa . After the voting , Mr. Hightower said , an analysis of the returns will show that Mr. Harris appeals to " more than the crazies . " Stephen J. Rapp , a lawyer and Congressional candidate in northeast Iowa , said the Oklahoman had already demonstrated that to him by " branching out from the nutballs to ordinary people like the farmers up in Chickasaw County . " Mr. Shriver , the only Roman Catholic in the race , apparently lost Catholic votes by his waffling on abortion , and his slack schedule puzzled politicians here . He also chose odd issues , such as a nebulous proposal to strengthen " the American family " that he put forward at a news conference in Des Moines . But he was still feared by the other contenders because of his charm as a campaigner , his name recognition and efforts by members of the Kennedy family on his behalf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two county chairmen last week that his supporters should vote uncommitted , in what seemed an effort to muddle the eventual results .
