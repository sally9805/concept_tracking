ZAIRE <P> For many of the eleven years that Mobutu Sese Seko , 46 , has ruled Zare , that huge central African country ( once known as the Belgian Congo ) has dined out on its promise of wealth . The country 's enormous , and still largely unexploited , deposits of copper served as a kind of collateral on which Zare managed to borrow extensively abroad . It now owes $2.9 billion , $800 million of which is due private lenders in the U.S. , Europe and Japan . But instead of achieving steady growth , Zare became a textbook example of how a Third World nation can dig itself into an economic hole . Today the country is all but bankrupt ; it has fallen badly behind in repaying its debts . Manhattan 's Citibank and other creditor banks have agreed to arrange a new $250 million loan , but first they imposed tough conditions under which Mobutu will in effect be forced to control his country 's economy strictly , under the eyes of experts at the International Monetary Fund . <P> Not Unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial as well as the developing world . " Zare 's folly is not so unique , " observes an American businessman in Kinshasa , the capital . Third World countries as a group have piled up a foreign debt that is estimated to be as high as $150 billion ; international conferences resound with cries for a moratorium or stretch-out of repayments on a large part of that debt . By mid-1976 U.S. banks alone had some $30 billion in outstanding loans to five nations-Argentina , Brazil , Mexico , Peru and Indonesia-that are considered potential problem debtors . The Zarian debacle increases doubts about how much of the Third World debt will continue to be repaid . <P> The troubles began five years ago when Mobutu , an autocrat who always carries a traditional tribal chieftain 's stick decorated with carved figures of birds and snakes , decreed an ambitious industrialization program . Instead of investing in agriculture-which would have increased food supplies and given many more Zarians jobs-Mobutu put $1 billion , much of it borrowed , into projects aimed at a vast expansion of copper exports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lost . During the world recession , copper prices plunged by 62% , and Zare 's copper revenues shrank from $934 million in 1974 to less than $600 million in 1975 . <P> As a result , three major projects have languished . A $500 million hydroelectric power transmission line that is supposed to snake over 1,200 miles of forest and bush from the Zare River ( once the Congo ) to the copper belt in Shaba ( formerly Katanga ) is far behind schedule . Construction of a huge addition to the state-owned Gcamines copper mine , financed by the World Bank , the European Investment Bank and the Libyan government , is 18 months late . Work has stopped on the giant new Tenke-Fungurume copper mine , and international backers are handing over $750,000 a month just for maintenance work on the site .
