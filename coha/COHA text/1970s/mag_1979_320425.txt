Venturesome companies bet big on " the rock that burns <P> Once again the turmoil in Iran emphasizes American dependence upon what Jimmy Carter calls the " thin line of oil tankers stretching halfway around the earth to one of the most unstable regions in the world . " The drive to gain some freedom from OPEC by developing domestic energy sources has never been more pressing . Last week the Senate easily adopted by a vote of 65 to 19 a $20 billion synthetic-fuel program that , among other things , would turn the nation 's vast coal deposits into oil and gas . But of all the old and new sources of petroleum now being freshly examined , none is more promising or as controversial as the oil-bearing rock known as shale . <P> Venturesome companies are betting millions on shale as they plunge deep into development projects that could soon foster a new energy industry . TIME Los Angeles Bureau Chief William Rademaekers reports from the heart of the U.S. shale country : <P> The dirt road running up Parachute Creek in western Colorado winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it deteriorates into first a stream bed and then a cliff-hugging path that passes a blackened ledge of shale rock that was struck by lightning two years ago and spouted flames for three days . The Indians once dubbed the magic mineral " the rock that burns . " <P> Finally , at an altitude of 8,200 ft. , the track breaks through onto a rolling plateau of sagebrush , juniper and pine . It is here , on this remote plateau , southwest of Rifle , Colo. , that Caterpillars of the Colony Development Operation have already cut 300 yds. into a mountain of shale . Near by , in another canyon , Union Oil engineers monitor a conveyor belt delivering a stream of shale into a giant funnel . Some 40 miles south , at Logan 's Wash , Occidental Petroleum miners have cut two mine faces into the sides of a shale mountain . Farther northwest lies another tract of shale land soon to be developed by Gulf Oil and Standard of Indiana . <P> This is the Piceance Basin , the heart of a geological formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Locked in the mottled rock is the energy equivalent of about 1.2 trillion bbl. of oil , or roughly 40 times the nation 's present proven reserves of liquid petroleum . <P> Actually , " shale oil " is neither shale nor oil . The rock is marl , a variety of limestone laced with a solid fossil fuel called kerogen . The kerogen was deposited 40 million years ago in the form of millions of tons of vegetable matter that collected on the bottom of a mammoth freshwater lake that then covered Utah , Wyoming and Colorado . But these lake-bed accumulations were never subjected to temperatures as high as 300 F and to extreme pressures that in time created underground deposits of readily usable liquid oil and natural gas . Now man must finish nature 's work .
