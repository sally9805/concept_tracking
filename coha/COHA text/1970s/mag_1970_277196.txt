EXCEPT for the unmistakably modern odor of tear gas and burning rubber , the southern Italian city of Reggio di Calabria could have passed for one of the fortified city-states that made up Italy before the nation was unified 100 years ago . For most of the week , towering barricades of tree trunks , paving stones and junk sealed the city off from the outside world while nearly 5,000 armed police and carabinieri laid siege to it . At one point , two columns of cops in full riot regalia , spearheaded by bulldozers and a construction crane , charged into a district that had styled itself an independent " republic " ; they were hurled back by a hail of bricks , bottles and Molotov cocktails . <P> As Reggie 's rebellion spread and cut off virtually the entire southern fifth of the country , Premier Emilio Colombo ordered troops to cope with a civil disturbance for the first time since 1946 . A force of 5,000 uniformed soldiers was moved into the area . For the second time in a tumultuous week , a Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face a gathering rebellion . <P> Citizens ' Revolt . The revolt of Reggio began last July , after Rome passed out the political fruits of the new decentralization program . Under the plan , 15 governmental regions were created and given their own administrative councils and a measure of local autonomy . As the biggest city ( pop . 160,000 ) in sere Calabria , Reggio seemed the obvious choice for the seat of the new regional government . The Reggini looked forward to the magic that a fat government payroll-and payola-could work on Reggio 's threadbare economy . <P> When the nod went instead to Catanzaro , a much smaller city ( pop . 82,000 ) 75 miles away , Reggio exploded . There were five days of street violence in July in which one civilian was killed and several policemen were injured . A bitter mood of rebellion grew against " the Bourbons " in Rome . Shopkeepers shuttered their stores and bankers locked their vaults . Schools were closed . <P> Though the government ordered state-owned TV to carry no news of the insurrection , the revolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Italy 's conservative C.I.S.L. labor union called a general strike in the Reggio area . Port workers , post office clerks and telephone and telegraph employees left their jobs . When railway workers followed last week , the 10 million people in Sicily and the toe of the Italian boot were virtually cut off from the rest of the ' ' country . Barricades and wrecked tracks forced trains from the north to halt two hours short of Reggio . The Highway of the Sun , Italy 's main north-south autostrada , was sealed off . With the port blocked , hundreds of trucks and freight cars stood idle on the other side of the Straits of Messina . <P> <P> Because Reggio is politically conservative , much of the Italian press reflexively labeled the demonstrators fascists and hooligans . Few fit the description ; the revolt has cut across class barriers . As Reggie 's aptly named Mayor Piero Battaglia declared , " This is a citizens ' revolt . "                   @ @
