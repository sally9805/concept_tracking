Though he has long since turned in his scalpel , ex-Surgeon Edgar Berman still knows how to be cutting . A few years ago , he touched off feminist outrage by suggesting that women might be unfit for the presidency because of their " raging hormonal influences . " Unchastened , the Maryland doctor-author , who limits his practice these days to a few old friends , including Senator Hubert Humphrey , * has now taken on a new adversary . In an outrageously satiric book titled The Solid Gold Stethoscope ( Macmillan ; $7.95 ) , he lays open the foibles and failings of his fellow doctors . <P> Beginning with what he calls the Hypocritic Oath ( " I swear by Midas , my malpractice insurance , the A.M.A ... " ) , Berman lets nary a branch of his calling escape his splenetic pen . To the vanishing , often bungling general practitioner , he says : " Good riddance . " His definition of what he believes surgeons regard as a " reasonable " fee : " All that the traffic can bear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit by rare flashes of brilliance such as transactional analysis and fornication therapy . " As for pediatricians , he asks : " What kind of intellect opts to spend the better part of its professional life with diaper rash as its most common challenge ? " <P> Aspirin or Ice Bag . With Swiftian hyperbole , Berman modestly proposes that " over 80% of the patients chancing the physician 's skills have little more wrong with them than what a considerate spouse , a kindly bartender or a hefty raise in salary could n't cure . " For most of the rest , he would prescribe nothing more exotic than milk of magnesia , aspirin , an ice bag or Preparation H. <P> Berman lampoons the growth of big , expensive hospitals- " Blue Cross Hiltons " - where you go " if you are deathly ill and want your body monitored by everything but a kind soul and a gentle hand . " He is merciless about medical greed : " Any M.D. who has to worry about his tax bracket after only six months in practice is a folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even socialized medicine could not bring back the house call , end unnecessary tonsillectomies or make $5,000 operations a thing of the past . For his resourceful fellow physicians would " never allow the manner of life to which they have become accustomed perish from these shores . " <P> Though the book has drawn predictable cries of outrage from many doctors and led one physician-reviewer to note that Berman seems to be trying to do for his profession what Jaws did for ocean bathing , others have been more generous . After reading the corrosive chapter on his own specialty , Heart Surgeon Denton Cooley , himself a target of a few Berman barbs , commented : " A lot of fun . " A plastic surgeon said that " anyone who is upset does not have a sense of humor . " Rockland State Hospital 's Dr. Nathan Kline , who is twitted along with other psychiatrists for pushing pills , perhaps provided the most perceptive analysis : while Berman 's book is " outrageously provocative " and sometimes " pure Paul Bunyan , " there is behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cure its flaws . In other words , Berman is repeating that most ancient admonition : physician , heal thyself . <P>
