T he first time I met Norman Rockwell was one frosty winter morning in a tiny New England village . There was a kind of blessing on the day that only a Charles Dickens could describe . And to make it almost supernaturally Rockwellian , I was accom  --  panied by a mere spit of a freckle-faced boy and a giant St. Bernard dog , who was self-elected to be our bodyguard . As we walked down the quiet , white Main Street , the only sounds the crunch and squeak of snow under our feet ( and paws ) , it seemed only fair to stop and cry halt- this - just-  can't- be there's-no-such-cast-o f-char- . - acters-ex cep t-on-a-Saturday  --  Even ing-Post-cover-stop-put  --  ting-me-on , but there it all was , just the same . For this was Norman Rockwell Country , Stock  --  bridge , Massachusetts , where nature copies art , and which gazetteers of the future might well refer to as Nor  --  man Rockville . It is his can  --  vas come to life . To face up to it here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as the old master was there to peer out of his stu  --  dio window , brushes in hand , to check on the north  --  ern light , and stand , instead , enraptured by the antics of a crow dancing on the branches of a tall pine , dis  --  lodging blobs and splashes of snow to create a three-dimensional pattern , white on white , on the frozen ground below . It was the perfect stage  --  perhaps the only stage  --  on which to meet Norman Rockwell , portraitist of country ways in America . This is Berkshire coun  --  try  --  not exactly mountainsas they would say it around the Tetons down Wyo  --  ming way , but still a flange of the Appalachians , with a wild look to the hills and every now and then a rocky peak , ancient and gnarled . This is handsome country , the peaks running in chains with deep val  --  leys between , fertile and firry and lush , curved to the oxbows of meandering streams and rivers . The blood of settlers tainted the brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own kind of welcome . Now , in the evening , the white frame houses light up the snow like Christmas cards , and Main Street is the model for a thousand dreams . The hills look down serenely on the " Happy Valley " as this is traditional  --  ly called , and the Housatonic River marks the edge of town , mirroring the birches on its banks . The town has been thus since 1739 , and its population has now swollen to 2,417 inhabitants . Molly and Norman Rock  --  well lived in a classic white frame house close to the road . Behind it is a red barn which was made into his studio . It overlooks a mead  --  ow which can not make up its mind whether it is a part of the Housatonic River or merely a shelf of land run  --  ning back from its west bank . The man whose autograph has been beseeched in Mo  --  roccan bazaars , French boites , and Italian gardens , whose paintings are cherish  --  ed by Americans above all others , opened his studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which seemed to say : " Goodness , could it be someone here to see me ? " The surprise was genuine . Norman Rockwell was unaf  --  fectedly humble . That morn  --  ing he had over 75 years behind him in which to dis  --  cover how superior he was to the rest of us ; all he had done was cultivate a respect for each of his fellow men . As aristocrat of creativity , his was the most democratic of hearts . Standing there making a small gesture of welcome in all his simple distinction , he seemed almost the Last Gen  --  tle Man of our time . Rockwell was all quiet charm . Slender in his years , he had still a tensile strength about him . The word " courtly " came to mind . His mother would have ap  --  proved of that , for she had named him after an En  --  glish ancestor of hers , Sir Norman Percevel , who , said Norman , " reputedly kicked Guy Fawkes down the stairs of the Tower of London after he tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was Norman Percevel Rockwell , a name he spent a lifetime trying to hide , having dropped the middle cognomen the minute he left home and his mother 's influence . But it is not altogether inappro  --  priate , considering that subtle aura of distinction which clung to him . Being able to paint as he did set Rockwell aside from other men . And in his case , the creative gift was fused with a personality happily amplifying it . His eye was that of a kindly philosopher . That is what makes his old men faintly comic while yet wearing crowns of dignity ; his old ladies fragile as Dresden china , but with a devil lurking somewhere inside ; his boys and girls , even while bearing clouds of glory from heaven , are still imps of mischievousness , never very far from needing either a good tanning or a kiss or both . The entire world and its inhabitants are Rock  --  well 's models . All this was packed away in that small frame , for al  --  though Rockwell was a giant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stature . Attempting to capture this quicksilver personality is a challenge . Certain words kept haunting me until I went back to Geoffrey Chau  --  cer and found them in his " Portrait of the Knight " penned some 500 years ago when our English language was very young : A Knight ther was , and that a worthy man , That fro the time that he first bigan To riden out , he loved chivalry e , Trouthe and honour , freedom and curteisye . And though that he were worthy , he was wis , And of his port as meeke as is a maide . He nevere yit no vilainye ne saide In al his lif unto no manere wight : He was a verray , parfit , gentil knight . Rockwell " takes five " at his easel to chat with the author . Both are native New Yorkers and graduate choir  --  boys from the Cathedral of St. John the Divine . Fro the time that he first bigan To riden out . , . how could Chaucer have ever known ? Molly and Norman Rockwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicycles every day they could in Stockbridge , and yet this publicist 's dream was taken for granted . Not a head turned . For the N. R. 's were part of their com  --  community , having earned that right by the New En glander 's traditional 20 years of residence . In 1972 the whole area was suddenly filled with vis  --  itors from all parts of the country , some of them recognizably household names in their own right , who had come to Stock  --  bridge to honor Norman Rockwell at the premiere of a TV special built around his life and career . At the first showing , I was happy to be there early , before the Rock-wells arrived . When they did , it was clear once again from his expression that he had no inkling of his own impor  --  tance  --  he started looking for a couple of seats in the back . .. that is , before the gather  --  ing in the Town Hall rose as one to applaud his entrance , and the couple was escorted to their front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the small figure , the conservative yet sporty clothes  --  moccasins , grey flannel slacks , navy blue jacket , button-down shirt , and inevitable small bow tie  --  but it was his gesture which made the moment so memorable . Surprised , pleas ed , quite flustered at the continuous applause , Nor  --  man made little waves of his hands over and around his head , as one wards off a swarm of yellow jackets , smiling the while at everybody , as if to apologize for his embarrassment at all the fuss . Afterwards at the party in his honor , he was his usual gracious self , thoughtful of everyone else 's comfort and enjoyment , and discussing with me what might be the earliest possible moment , within propriety , to escape the lionization and retire to the solitary pleasures of an evening at home . There you have Norman Rockwell . One who knew him well , Ben Hibbs , who worked with the artist over many years as editor of the Post , said , " somehow he himself was like a gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply American , varied in mood , but full , always , of the zest of living . " Zest is right . When a man has a place all to him self  --  studio or library or workshop  --  you can tell a lot about him by just looking around . Gaze with me back at his studio : a tiny gilt angel suspended from the high ceiling ; a ship model mounted far up on the wall . Here is his library of art books : Monet , El Greco , twentieth century art from the Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller Collection . Jack Levine is on the shelf in be  --  tween Caravaggio and the art treasures of the Louvre . This was a man of the world , virile and curious . There are weapons every  --  where : a Winchester rifle with his nameplate on it ; flintlocks and ancient pis  --  tols ; a curved creese ; a hol  --  ster and cartridge belt half filled with bullets ; spears from the Pacific ; noble hel  --  mets from the heavy cavalry of Napoleonic wars ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ webbing to protect the sides and back of the neck , that once adorn  --  ed a Saracen warrior . Pipes , the Rockwell trademark , are everywhere . There are dolls from all over the world : the Far East , Eskimo country , Russia , Africa . Sleigh bells on the door jingle as you en  --  ter . There 's a huge Russian samovar , filled with artist 's brushes . On the front of the studio , a high wall is filled with Rockwell paintings , a fresh one on the floor show  --  ing an animated scene at the Stockbridge firehouse . There are echoes from the past : a postcard from the Nassau Inn in Princeton , New Jersey , where Rock  --  well 's famous painting Yan  --  kee Doodle Went To Town adorns the wall of the tap  --  room behind the bar ; an up  --  to-the-second memento , a photograph of the crew of Apollo 11 inscribed to Nor  --  man Rockwell and signed by Edward E. Aldrin , Neil Arm  --  strong , and Michael Collins ; a mosaic sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from page 38 On the studio wall , a tiny card holds a few lines by Yeats : An aged man is but a paltry thing , A tattered coat upon a stick , unless Soul clap its hands and sing , and louder sing For every tatter in its mortal dress . That says it all in this wonderful place . Through the high skylight window , we look north toward the village through giant elms and birches . A tiny porch on the west side of the studio perches over the meadow , a deer 's leap below . If a man could paint well any  --  where , it would be here , Rockwell has been no stranger to the world of celebrities . Consider those who sat for his portraits  --  Ike Eisenhower , John F. Kennedy , Richard Nixon , Adlai Stevenson . At such times he inevitably emerged from their sessions as a friend of the model . He knew scores of famous actors and became friends with Bing Crosby and Gary Cooper as he sketched them . Once he even corrected Sam Goldwyn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one end of Hollywood to another , where if Goldwyn made a mistake , that made it right ! I guess one of the secrets of his mod  --  esty is the fact that he knew in his heart he had always done exactly what he had wanted to do with his art . It came as a surprise to him when what came so naturally began to shape up as both fame and fortune . " I paint what I like to paint , " Rock  --  well once said . " And somehow , for some reason , a good part of the time it coincides with what a lot of people like ; it 's popular . Which some ( the art critics , for instance ) would say makes me a low type , mediocre , slightly despicable , etc. , etc . And it may be true ( when I 'm de  --  pressed I think it is ) . After all , I 'm not exactly in the mainstream of art in our time . But there 's nothing really I can do about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the way I 'm made . I do n't do it for money or fame or any of the other degrading motives which are thought to be the source of popular art . I paint what I do the way I do because that 's how I feel about things . " The feelings go far back . Rockwell was born in uptown New York City , when it was a middle-class island enclave of respectability . He sang in the choir of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine . His parents took him to the country every summer where he lived surrounded by farm animals and the images of small-town living . Thesethings are important to an understand  --  ing of the Rockwell image of the world , and they are doubly important to this memoir  --  if you will forgive me  --  because I too was born in New York , sang at St. John 's , rode the trolley cars to West  --  chester and Rye Beach , and went away every summer to board on a farm to escape the city 's heat . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the city you are constantly confronted by unpleasantness . I find it sordid and unsettling . Against this image of the city  --  exaggerated and distorted as it is , I have never been able to get rid of it en  --  tirely  --  I set the country . " My family spent every summer until I was nine or ten years old in the coun  --  try at various farms which took in boarders . Those country boardinghouses were n't like the resorts of today . The advertisement in the New York papers would state : Tennis Court . But when you arrived , there would n't even be an old tennis ball kicking around on the floor , so you 'd ask , ' Say , where 's the tennis court ? ' And the farmer would re  --  ply , ' Oh , if you look under the hall stairs , you 'll find the net . You string it anywhere in the meadow you want . ' " Those boardinghouses were just farms . The grownups played croquet or sat in the high slat-backed rockers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do just about anything we want  --  ed . We helped with the milking , fished , swam in the river or the muddy farm pond , trapped birds , cats , turtles , snakes , and , one glorious morning , a muskrat ; we smoked corn silk behind the barn , fell off wagons , horses , out of lofts  --  did everything , in fact , that coun  --  try boys do except complain about the drudgery and boredom of the farm . " Of my winters in the city I have both a general impression  --  the sordid  --  ness , the filth , the drunks  --  and many memories of specific events and particu  --  lar people . But those summers , as Hook back on them , have become a collection of random impressions  --  sights , sounds , smells  --  outside of time , not connected with a specific place or event and all together forming an image of sheer bliss  --  fulness , one long , radiant summer . God knows , a country cur has just as many fleas as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I did , they were crowded out by the first sleepy cries of the whip  --  poorwills at dawn and long , lazy after  --  noons spent fishing for bullheads , the emerald dragonflies darting around our heads . ( We called them darning needles and endowed them with a deadly sting . ) Oh , it sounds corny enough when I tell it . But that 's the way I thought of the country then and stilt do in spite of myself . " Later on I came to realize ( reluc  --  tantly ) that ugly things happen in the Continued on page 104 Gentle Man continued from page 89 country as well as in the city . Still , that did n't change my ideas . I like the coun  --  try better . " Those blissful summers in the coun  --  try . I remember the farm horses , their long , shaggy manes hanging almost to the water as they drank , snuffling and blowing , after a day in the hay fields . The horse would raise his head for a mo  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop it again to the water so suddenly that I 'd slide right down his neck , kerplunk , into the stream , the horse stopping his drinking to look calmly at this sudden apparition splash  --  ing in the shallows . And the hot , heavy smell of the horses as we currycombed them in the barn afterward , stretching up on tiptoe to reach the broad expanse of their backs , watching with satisfaction as the harness marks disappeared . " I remember wrestling and tumbling in the mow until we collapsed , exhaust  --  ed , in the warm , fragrant hay and lay dazed , with the rough-hewn beams of the roof dark and immense above us and dust motes swirling in the shafts of late afternoon sunlight . I remember throw  --  ing off my shoes and socks to wiggle my bare toes in the cool , green grass on our first day in the country , then running off gingerly over the gravel road and hay stubble in the field to the river for our first swim . The hayrides , all the board  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good tenor ) as the horses trotted along the dark country lanes ; the excite  --  ment of eating lunch with the threshing crew at the long board tables ; hunting bullfrogs with a scrap of red silk tied to the end of a pole ; the turtles and frogs we carried back to the city in the fall , snuffling and crying on the train be  --  cause summer was over and we had to leave the country . I remember we 'd put the frogs and turtles in a bowl of water and feed them religiously every day . But invariably , two months later , we 'd find them floating dead in the bowl . And then that summer was dead , too . " Sentimental trash ? Maybe . But that 's how I saw the country . I actually lived the idealized version of the life of a farm boy in the late nineteenth cen  --  tury . I remember that , once in the coun  --  try , even I changed . In the city we kids delighted to go up on the roof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street below . But we never did things like that in the country . The clean air , the green fields , the thou  --  sand and one things to do , the raw  --  boned farmers , their faces burned a deep brick red by the sun and wind ( but with that circle of pure white skin just below the hairline where their hats shad  --  ed their foreheads ) , got somehow into us and changed our personalities as much as the sun changed the color of our skins . " I would not have dwelt so long up  --  on these summers I spent in the country as a child , except that I think they had a lot to do with what I painted later on . " The view of life I communicate in my pictures excludes the sordid and ugly . I paint life as I would like it to be . ( Somebody once said that I paint the kind of girls your mother would want you to marry . ) In 1951 I painted a Post cover for the Thanksgiving issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shabby railroad restaurant . The people around them were staring , some sur  --  prised , some puzzled , some remember  --  ing their own lost childhood , but all re  --  spectful . If you actually saw such a scene in a railroad station , some of the people staring at the old woman and the boy would have been respectful , some indifferent ( probably a majority ) , some insulting and rude , and perhaps a few would have been angry . But I did n't see it that way . I just naturally made the people respectful . The picture is not ab  --  solutely true to life ; it 's not a photo  --  graph of an actual scene but the scene as I saw it . " Frederic Remington painted the romantic , glamorous aspects of the West  --  cowboys sitting around a camp  --  fire , an attack on a stagecoach Any old-timer can tell you that the West was a lot more than that  --  that life in the Wild West was at times pretty drab . But Remington , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West as a tourist , did n't experience that drudgery and boredom  --  just as I missed the dullness of farm life . I doubt that I would have idealized the country if I had grown up as a farm boy . " I sometimes think we paint to fulfill ourselves and our lives , to supply the things we want and do n't have . I knew a real country yokel in art school . Five years later I met him again . He worespats , carried a cane , and kept his black derby on when he painted . He had be  --  come a famous fashion illustrator and cosmopolite . " Maybe as I grew up and found that the world was n't the perfectly pleasant place I had thought it to be I uncon  --  sciously decided that , even if it was n't an ideal world , it should be and so painted only the ideal aspects of it  --  pic  --  tures in which there were no drunken slatterns or self-centered mothers ; in which , on the contrary , there were only foxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fished from logs and got up circuses in the backyard . If there was sadness in this created world of mine , it was a pleasant sadness . If there were problems , they were humor  --  ous problems . The people in my pic  --  tures are n't mentally ill or deformed . The situations they get into are com  --  monplace , everyday situations , not the agonizing crises and tangles of life . " The summers I spent in the country as a child became part of this idealized view of life . Those summers seemed blissful , sort of a happy dream . But I was n't a country boy , I did n't really live that kind of life . Except ( heads up , here comes the point of the whole digres  --  sion ) later on in my paintings . " So here , in a way , is the Rockwell secret . Not unlike that in Citizen Kane where one word , " Rosebud , " spoken at the moment of death , becomes the miss  --  ing key to the multimillionaire 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( but never the characters in the movie ) only learns at the very end that " Rosebud " was the name stenciled on a sled he had treasured as a boy . Norman started sketching as a boy at home , putting down scenes from Dick  --  ens . He left school as a sophomore in high school and went straight into art . " Ever since I can remember , Rembrandt has been my favorite artist . Vermeer , Breughel , Velisquez , Canaletto ; Dfirer , Holbein as draftsmen ; Matisse , Klee  --  these are a few of the others I admire . During my student days I studied close  --  ly the works of Edward Austin Abbey , J.C . and Frank Leyendecker , Howard Pyle , Sargent , Whistler . " This is the other key to Rockwell 's work . These are not the words of a simple copyist . This is a sophisticated student of art talking , a man whose ad  --  miration for Picasso influenced much of his work , yet he was able to distill all of this knowledge into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing most  --  the ones we all know and love . It took years of hard work , of dedication , of failure , to achieve his monumental success . Rockwell had a soft and kindly eye , but there had to be iron in him , too  --  from the very be  --  ginning . The very success of Rockwell 's work tends to underestimate the artist behind the man who has achieved a public ac  --  ceptance unparalleled in our time . A case in point is a request from no less an eminence in aesthetics than the Metropolitan Museum in New York City , where the visitor contemplating the pictures on the wall begins to won  --  der if all the most famous canvases in history have not been brought together here . The request came from Robert Beverly Hale , curator of American painting at the Metropolitan . The story is told by Ken Stuart , who was the Post 's art editor during 18 years of Rockwell 's most productive work , from 1944 to 1962 , when the artist was producing an average of 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for one of Rockwell 's paintings for the Met . " What painting ? " asked Stuart . " Any one , " said Hale . " Well , why ? " " We feel that 2.000 years from now when visitors come to the Metropolitan , a Rock  --  well painting will reflect the way Americans of our day looked and liv  --  ed . " Stuart laughs trium  --  phantly at this . The point is that the Met , as the pinnacle of art in this country , is not about to hang anything on its walls short of a masterpiece  --  the word  --  ing of the request sug  --  gests that anything Rockwell paints will do for the ages . " Most artists gasp when they see what Rockwell can do , " says Stuart , a distinguished artist in his own right . " The peculiar thing is that most people think it takes him forever to do a cover painting . The fact is , he may spend six months on a painting ; on the other hand he could do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no telling , real  --  ly , in advance ... except that he was so marvelously obliging . There were times , on some Wednesday or Friday after  --  noon , when I could see the Post cover inventory beginning to hit bottom , and I would get in touch with Norman , tell him my problem , and that marvelous man never failed . I would have it Mon  --  day morning . " You never knew , either , what size Rockwell would bring in . He worked in all different sizes . Sometimes he 'd do something only about the size of the magazine itself . Then on occasion he 'd do something as big as a barn door . Onetime I asked him about that  --  it happen  --  ed to be a sketch he 'd made for his famous painting , the little boy and the old lady saying grace in the railroad sta  --  tion restaurant , surrounded by the other passengers ( it was immense ) ? and he said that sometimes he liked to be a part of a scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a part of it . I 'm right in the restaurant with the lady saying grace . ' " Norman worked with models only early in his career . But then art directors began to demand angles and perspec  --  tives that were difficult to achieve in a studio at a range of ten feet . It became necessarylor him to use photographs , if only to save time and get the models set precisely as he wanted them . Norman always insisted on no special lighting ef  --  fects . He wanted his light direct from the top . Then he 'd start that movie di  --  rector routine of his  --  he was a great mimic and actor , and he could put life into a situation . This photography , how  --  ever , followed a basic sketch in pencil or sometimes in oils to capture the mood and design of the picture . He 'd show that sketch or oil to me , we 'd agree or make a minor change here or there , then he 'd take the photographs to cor  --  respond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing , very meticulous in some cases , invariably large . If you look at one of those original charcoal sketches  --  the lady saying grace , for ex  --  ample  --  you 'll see some pinholes all over it . Norman would put the sketch over his canvas , then blow charcoal dust through the holes , so when he faced his canvas for the final version he 'd have his bearings , except that by now he knew by heart precisely what he was going to paint . His work was unbelievable in terms of care . " Norman was the easiest man in the world to work with . And generous . He did that famous portrait of Ike Eisen  --  hower in a half hour . That embarrassed him so at the price we were paying him that he did six more little sketches , five of Ike and one of Mamie , that were ab  --  solute gems . " Like Ken Stuart , everyone who knew Norman Rockwell finds it hard to re  --  strain the superlatives . But Rockwell 's own writings and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions . He admitted to many failures and even to apprehen  --  sion while waiting for the final verdict to come through from the Post after he had worked heart and soul over a paint  --  ing . In one mischievous painting , Rock  --  well once used a very hoity-toity " soci  --  ety " woman as a model for a lady cook . The lady never forgave him for her unhappy notoriety . Foibles , too , can make the man . Thus , Norman Rock  --  well has shown us his own , and our own , and added them all up into portraiture which bids fair never to be forgot  --  ten . But the amazing part of his feat is the per  --  sonal touch , the bridge he built between himself and his beholders . Can you remember who painted The Last Supper or the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel , for sure ? Norman would blush to be mentioned in such company , and perhaps rightly . But his achieve  --  ment was on his own level . As Ken Stuart puts it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prin  --  ciples . " And , of all painters great and small , perhaps he is supreme in one re  --  spect  --  regardless of the subject , a Rock  --  well is a Rockwell , and there are mil  --  lions of people today who can recognize one immediately , without benefit of any art background or insights . He ac  --  complished that in part through tech  --  nique . But it is the man who shines through , indissolubly one with his work , his idea as great as his rendering . The Rockwell legend is wholly unique in this encompassing respect . We can pretty safely say that there proba  --  bly will never be another like him ; our " parfit , gentil knight , " wise and witty , the reflection of our better selves . Be  --  cause , oddly enough , the thing which set him so completely apart was that he always believed that he was merely one of us . F :                   @ @
