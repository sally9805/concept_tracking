The rare snows have melted , and the record chill has receded in Florida . But the truck gardens in the far south of the state lay devastated , their tomatoes , lettuce and cucumbers wiped out by the cold . Some migrant workers are heading northward , searching for new crops to pick . There is work in the citrus groves of central Florida-hard , chilly work-as growers race to salvage what they can of an orange crop that was 30% to 40% destroyed by the Big Freeze . You can see the damage from the air-the telltale brownish gray of damaged trees edges out the green in the undulating groves near Orlando . <P> If the frost-kissed oranges , which turn dry and mealy , can be picked fast enough , they can still be used for concentrated orange juice . But the branches are brittle , the pickers ' fingers are numb , and an orange that falls may well be too damaged to ship as fresh fruit . <P> When the worst of the cold struck , some 40 migrant workers were taken from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and housed and fed at public expense for six days in a Ramada Inn . In the area as a whole , however , the crisis has heightened rather than eased the traditional tensions between growers and workers . Florida Governor Reubin Askew 's success in getting Carter to declare the region a disaster area is resented by the owners in conservative Lake and Orange counties-both of which voted for Gerald Ford in November . They are afraid that the federal funds will go mostly to pickers in the form of unemployment compensation , claiming that many workers will stop picking once the pay is available . " With your citrus worker , you put a check in his pocket and he 'll come right down off the ladder to spend it , " claims Owner George Karst . <P> Sudden Warmth . Thomas Credle , coordinator for the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration , disagrees . Said he : " There is no clear evidence that workers do seek federal funds instead of working . " Some $12.8 million has been allotted to Florida for special unemployment payments , but workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> On the job , the workers get between 35 and 55 for each 90-lb. box of oranges , and it takes a man , wife and couple of children a full week of hard work to make $125 . The migrant families average only between $2,000 and $7,000 a year . To qualify for regular unemployment compensation , the migrants must be employed for 20 weeks a year . " Trouble with this short season is there 's no way you can get your weeks in , " complains Willie McCree , 26 , who is now making only about $80 a week . <P> The full damage to the orange crop will not be known for several weeks . Unlike much of the frigid U.S. , Florida 's crop growers would actually like the chilly weather to continue . A sudden flood of warm sunshine would accelerate the rotting of damaged fruit and increase the loss far beyond the $125 million already estimated . " All we need is a few days in the 80s , " says Grower Karst , " and then you 'll see a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
