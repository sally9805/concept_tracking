Fire swept 80 percent of the venerable vessel Jan. 9 as she lay at anchor in Hong Kong harbor ? just as refitting work reportedly was reaching its latter stages .

Weighing in at more than 80,000 tons she still was one of the largest ships afloat ? and her former patrons and unofficial friends are worldwide . As twilight approached , fresh explosions and fires were heard and seen aboard the ill-fated vessel . Maritime experts expressed concern that the 31-year-old veteran might capsize and sink at her anchorage . Once it was reasonably certain that those aboard ? including crew and workmen as well as some company officials ? had been taken off or been rescued from the harbor waters in the early stages of the fire , firefighting operations almost ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already had taken so much water aboard she was in danger of capsizing . Her list was estimated at 15 to 20 degrees and increasing .

Ever since being sold by Britain 's Cunard Line as too elderly and unable to meet the competition of modern jet airliners , both the old Queen Elizabeth and her slightly older sister ship , the Queen Mary , have had their difficulties .

Soon upped to a " disaster alarm " by the fire department , the fire broke out while the luncheon party was en route across the harbor to see the improvement made aboard Seawise University . Only a few days ago , Tung officials admitted that costs were running far ahead of original estimates . They felt the final bill  --  covering everything from original purchase price of $3.2 million to finishing touches  --  probably would total between $11 million and $12 million .                 @ @ @ @
