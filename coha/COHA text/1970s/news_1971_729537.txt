txt More than three years ago , officials here announced plans to spend $105-million to expand Portland International Airport , which hugs the southern shore of the Columbia River not far from the jagged snowy crest of Mount Hood . Nearly two years ago , the Army Corps of Engineers authorized the Port of Portland , which owns the airport , to fill and dredge a one-square-mile section of the Columbia to provide acreage needed for the expansion . But the huge landfill project has never begun  --  and there are doubts here that it ever will . It has been blocked by three lawsuits brought by an alliance of conservationists and homeowners who live across the river in Washington , and inflation has added $40-million to the project 's original cost . The Impasse here is an example of what is rapidly becoming a pattern in this country  --  and in much of the rest of the world  --  when efforts are made to build new jetports or expand old ones . Yesterday in New York City , for instance , three towns filed a suit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force Base as a fourth major jetport for the New ' York metropolitan area . And elsewhere across the country virtually every major proposed jetport is under fire from one or more opposition groups . In a growing number of cities , opponents are proving to be highly successful in halting the project 's or delaying them for long periods , not only by legal action but also by invoking environmental protection // provisions of recent Federal legislation . With local variations , the kind of resistance that has thwarted the airport expansion ? Jere ls also blocking or delaying jetport projects in Atlanta , Boston , Los Angeles , Minneapolis-St . Paul , New.York , San Jose , Calif. , and St. Louis , among other cities . Citizens with sentiments much in common with those in Portland and Boston are also opposing projects in Tokyo , Zurich , Switzerland , find Dilsseldorf , West Germany . Environmental opposition led Britain recently to choose a site for London 's third airport 56 miles from the city on the English Channel , far from the populated areas where aviation interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airline and Government aviation specialists are warning that the increasing delays and rejection of airport projects could severely limit the nation 's air commerce , starting perhaps in 1975 but becoming serious after 1980 . F.A.A. Head Critical John H. Shaffer , administra ? tor of the Federal Aviation Administration , asserted recently that " public resistance to new airports has become almost paranoid . " He said that F.A.A. forecasts indicated the nation would need about 100 new commercial airports between now and 1981 . But he said the " odds of getting those airports , in time , are not favorable unless public antipathy and community apathy can be overcome . " In itself , opposition to jetports is not a new phenomenon . It began to surface more than a decade ago , when the first jet airliners began disturbing the quiet around airport communities . Starting in 1959 , New Jersey citizens successfully fought , efforts of the Port of New York Authority to build a jetport at several locations in their state , scoring the first victories of the type that are now spreading to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance to jetports has gained momentum recently for several reasons . It has been spurred by the nation 's over-all environmental movement that began to gather steam about two years ago . Not only airports , but also highways , bridges , power stations and other facilities that environmental , groups consider undesirable are being challenged in court and in legislative chambers . One of the first major victories of the anti-airport move ? ment beyond the New York area was the Department of Transportation 's decision last year halting work on a jetport in the Florida Everglades . Groups opposing jetports have been given added ammunition in two pieces of recent legislation . The Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires developers of any federally authorized project , such as an airport , to submit a statement defining what the adverse environmental impact would be and requiring analysis of possible alternatives . 1970 Act Goes Further The Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 ? which will provide up to $280-million , annually in Federal aid for airport construction  --  goes even further . It requires developers of airports to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their projects . It prohibits the Secretary of Transportation from authorizing projects if there would be adverse effect on natural resources or other aspects of the quality of life in a community unless he declares in writing there is no feasible or prudent alternative . Residents Oppose . Jets " Before , they could hold us up in court with delaying tactics , " the manager of a large West Coast airport said . " Now , they can require hearings and there will always be some people who will come out of the woodwork to oppose anything . A few people can make a lot of noise . So in the transcript it looks like everybody is against it . " The increasing confrontations between airport planners and citizens groups in some ways is a product of two national trends : growing obsolescence of airports built in the pre-jet age ; and the mushrooming growth of , suburbia around cities . Many airports erected 20 or 30 years ago on , barren farmland et the outskirts of a city are now crowded in by sub diyisions and apartments , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing more ribisy jets over their homes . 1For Marty years ; it was dogma among many . aviation leaders that one answer to the problem was to go again to the outskirts of town  --  to buy up a huge tract Of land far from the city and zone adjacent land to prevent residential developIment nearby . Recent events raised some questions about this . Los Angeles went more than 40 miles from its downtown center to select a 17,000-acre airport site in Palmdale , in dry , barren Antelope Valley . The Sierra Club is now suing to invalidate F.A.A. approval of the site . New York 's Metropolitan Transportation Authority wants to ' convert the , former Stewart Air Force Base , more than 60 miles from Manhattan , Into a jetport . But community opposition has been stirred up , rel suiting in the filing of a law , suit . Some conservationists in . Canada are opposing Montreal 's proposed ' new airport ? ' potentially the world 's largest ? which is to cover more than 80,00D acres , most of it zoned to restrict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as here Fernand , waterways provide the only , room for airports to grow . But efforts to disturb the scenic and recreational values and the wildlife ' of ' waterways inevitably , bring opposition of the kind that killed this year a plan to expand Kennedy International Airport into adjacent Jamaica Bay . A plan by Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago to build a new jetport in Lake Michigan is under attack from conservationists , as is , to lesser degree , a proposal in Cleveland . to build a new jetport in Lake Erie . - The Port of Portland contends that the present airport will be inadequate by 1980 at the latest , and that it needs land for additional runways to inorease the airport 's capacity to handle jets . It wants to remove two small islands in the river and part of a third , and fill in land along roughly a 5.5-mile stretch of the river . The Columbia rises in a glacier-fed lake in British Columbia 1,200 miles to the north passes through ' Portland , turns briefly to the north then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 miles away . Foes File Suit In 1969 , a suit was brought to prevent the dredging by the Sierra Club , the Citizens Committee for the Columbia River , and three sportsmen 's associations . The principal point argued by the opponents was a contention that the project involved the creation of dikes and causeways on the river : They cited an 1899 Federal law that prohibits such projects on ' rivers without the express consent of Congress . It was this law that environmentalists used to upset the controversial Hudson River Expressway . in New York . A Federal judge held that the five organizations did not have standing to sue . They have appealed this decision . Meanwhile , the suit was refiled in the names of seven families who live on the northern bank of the river in Washington and are suing as citizens . They also cite the 1899 law , and contend that the airport would cause " noise , water , air and visual pollution . " The opponents ' legal fight has so far cost about $24,000 and has been financed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Dr. Carl E. Petterson , a Van . couver , Wash. , physician , who is leading the opposition as president of the Citizens Committee for the Columbia River . He said appeals will be made to any future adverse court rulings . Attorneys for the Port of Portland estimate that it takes la minimum of five years to carry a case through the Circuit Court of Appeals . " And if something were wrong either with their side or yours , you 're back again and you start all over , " one attorney said . Similar interminable delays are expected to face many other airport projects if the present trend continues . Outlook Termed Dim J. Donale Reilley , executive vice president of the . Airport Operators Council International , an association of agencies that run airports , said in an interview that from his point of view the picture was not very promising .

" Someone , sometime has got Ito be given the final say ; it ca n't drag on forever , " he said .
