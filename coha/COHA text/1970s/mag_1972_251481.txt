It looked about like any other summer camp . Boys were kicking soccer balls , skimming Frisbees and grousing about the lack of girls . Then the public address system crackled , and all 100 of them-two selected by each state - rushed to the recreation hall to hear Dr. Isidore Adler of the Goddard Space Flight Center discuss the problems of mapping the moon . <P> At question time , the long-haired youths in jeans and sneakers fired away : Is the fission theory of the moon 's origin the most powerful one ? Is there life on other planets ? ( " I do n't believe in UFOs , " said Dr. Adler , " but I 'd be astounded if there was not life in some other solar system . " ) <P> This is a unique institution called the National Youth Science Camp , where 100 of the nation 's brightest 16-to 18-year-old male science students ( average IQ : 130-plus ) gather for a free three weeks of serious talk and relaxation . West Virginia originally founded the camp in the Monongahela National Forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly to enhance the state 's backward image ( annual cost : $80,000 ) . After ten summers , the 15-acre camp has become a nationally respected meeting ground for young talent . IBM lends computer equipment ; the nearby National Radio Astronomy Observatory provides lecturers . The counselors are experts in such specialties as FORTRAN and high polymers . <P> Every morning , the campers get up at 7:45 , salute the flag and start hearing lectures , two to four a day . In addition , some 50 students are giving seminars on their own pet projects . Among them : micropaleontology and the effects of high-energy radiation on biochemical substances . <P> Almost everything at the camp is geared to study . A class in shop teaches the grinding of telescope lenses . Instead of just whacking at the local bugs commonly called " no-see-ums , " the campers scrutinize them under microscopes and discover that they are of the genus Culicoides . Even practical jokes are on the intellectual side . On one occasion , campers made a listening device out of materials found in the crafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office . <P> Much of the value of the camp comes not from the subjects taught , however , but simply from the encounter with the other campers . Says Director Joseph M. Hutchison Jr. , a professor at West Virginia University : " For the first time , many of the boys meet intellectual equals of their own age . Some even confess they 're not as smart as they thought they were . "
