We had installed enough missiles already to destroy New York , Chicago and the other industrial cities , not to mention a little village like Washington . I do n't think America had ever faced such a real threat of destruction . <P> THE moment in question was the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 , when the U.S. and the Soviet Union came closer to nuclear war than at any time before or since . The 13 days of that near-apocalypse are vividly recalled this week by one of the two men who could have given the actual orders to push the button : former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev . Khrushchev 's recollections , focusing on his years in power , are excerpted in LIFE and 19 foreign publications , and will appear shortly in the Little , Brown book Khrushchev Remembers . <P> Alarming News . Khrushchev says that in the spring of 1962 , at a meeting in the Kremlin , he spoke about how Cuba 's Fidel Castro had resisted the Bay of Pigs landing only a year earlier . " I said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be as badly planned and executed as the first . I warned that Fidel would crushed and said we were the only ones who could prevent such a disaster from occurring . " Khrushchev found another justification : " The Americans had surrounded our own country with military bases and threatened us with nuclear weapons , and now they would learn just what it feels like . " <P> Khrushchev began rushing intermediate-range nuclear missiles , launching equipment and Ilyushin-28 bombers to Cuba . President Kennedy 's dramatic response was to order a naval blockade of Cuba and to warn that the U.S. would take " whatever means may be necessary " to remove the missiles . Khrushchev grew alarmed . Seeking " to take the heat off the situation , " he suggested to other members of his government : " Comrades , let 's go to the Bolshoi Theater this evening . Our own people as well as foreign eyes will notice , and perhaps it will calm them down . " After he and Kennedy had begun exchanging secret personal messages , he recalls , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ministers offices in the Kremlin . I slept on a couch , and I kept my clothes on . I was ready for alarming news to come any moment . "
