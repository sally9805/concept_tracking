THE GREAT WALDO PEPPER <P> Directed by GEORGE ROY HILL Screenplay by WILLIAM GOLDMAN <P> Waldo Pepper is a young man who spends his brief life one step behind history , hurrying to catch up and never quite making it . The greatest natural flyer his World War I squadron leader ever saw , Waldo nevertheless came too late for the greatest days of aerial combat , particularly the chance to duel the German ace of aces , Ernst Kessler . Barnstorming in an aerial circus during the mid- ' 20s , he senses that the tide has once more turned against him . The aviation establishment is now interested in proving to the public that flying is a safe and reliable means of transportation , rather than in determining who will be the first nut to do an outside loop . Again , Smiling Waldo is too late with too much of the wrong kind of skill and spirit . <P> One must not think of Waldo ( Robert Redford ) as merely a daredevil , idly tempting fate . Rather , he is a distillation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their feeling was that the suddenly accessible sky offered not just a beauty and a freedom the earthbound could never know , but a purifying simplicity as well . In those early days , there were well known limits of performance against which one pressed , hoping through technique and aeronautical invention , to redefine them . There was also a direct correlation between talent and success ( which could be defined simply as survival ) that seemed unknown on the ground . A camaraderie grew among the handful of initiates in this new and glamorous mystery that was not to be found anywhere else either . <P> Dark Mood . The movie does not state this message directly . Instead , it sifts through a succession of exquisitely made thrill sequences . Early on , the mood is farcical : Waldo loosening the wheels of a rival barnstormer so that he must crash-land in a pond ; Waldo disastrously trying to perfect the crowd pleasing trick of transferring from moving car to low-flying plane by means of a suspended rope ladder . <P> Thereafter the mood darkens . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while testing a new plane , and Waldo is permanently grounded for buzzing the crowd that gawks at the man 's death by fire . In the end there is nothing left for Waldo but the ultimate commercialization of his love for his craft : stunt-flying in a Hollywood war movie . There , ironically , he finally gets his chance to fly against Kessler , and , by turning a fake dogfight into the real thing , to pass into legend himself . <P> Waldo Pepper is a flamboyant movie , eminently satisfying just as a spectacle . What transforms it into something more is the authenticity that Director Hill , whose avocation is flying antique airplanes , brings to it . He is obviously paying tribute to a spirit of gallantry that he believes in and admires . Fortunately , he has communicated his earnestness to Writer Goldman , whose humor is tempered by uncharacteristic restraint , and to an excellent cast , among whom Bo Brundin as Kessler stands out . As for Redford , this is his best work since Downhill Racer . Appealingly awkward when trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his most dashingly self-destructive mode when demonstrating the heights to which his passion drives him . All in all , The Great Waldo Pepper is popular entertainment of a very high order . Richard Schickel
