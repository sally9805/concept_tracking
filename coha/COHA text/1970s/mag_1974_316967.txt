In the minds of President Ford and his hard-line economic advisers , Public Enemy No. 1 is still inflation-not recession . That will be clear from the federal budget cuts that the Administration is expected to urge on Congress this week . Amid evidence of an economy sliding swiftly into deep recession and forecasts that unemployment will top 7% next year , Ford is still likely to ask for cuts of $4 billion to $5 billion , mostly in defense spending and social-welfare programs . <P> When he moved into the White House , Ford promised to get control of federal spending , which he regards as the principal engine of inflation . Although he originally talked about holding spending in fiscal 1975 to less than $300 billion , his own proposals for helping the unemployed , and such items as a further $1.5 billion increase ( to about $33 billion ) in interest on the mounting national debt , have since raised the budget target to somewhat more than $303 billion . The rapid deterioration of the economy since August has not at all shaken Ford 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is most reluctant to switch from a policy of inflation-fighting reduction to a policy of recession-fighting stimulation-but pressure is building to do just that . <P> Says Paul McCracken , a top Republican economist who advises Ford : " Paradoxical as it may seem , the cause of longer-run price stability makes some easing of policies urgent now . " McCracken believes that " if we do not get some easing now , the recession will be unnecessarily deep , and we would court the risk of a belated , massive swing to ease later that would set us off on another inflationary spiral by 1976 or 1977 . " McCracken still wants " a stern budget line , " but he also wants a substantial easing of monetary policy . <P> Try Harder . Other politicians and economists are clamoring for a loosening up of fiscal as well as monetary policy . Says Harvard 's Otto Eckstein , a member of TIME 'S Board of Economists : " By early 1975 , the recession is likely to be sufficiently severe that the moment for modest personal income tax reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living apt to rise another 8% next year , no one is urging a massive easing of either fiscal or monetary policy . But the Administration has been quietly pressing Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur Burns to try harder to increase the money supply . In the last two weeks , the money supply has moved upward again after nearly five months of no growth . Housing is usually last to benefit from an easing of credit conditions , but Burns is predicting that credit will relax enough so that large amounts of mortgage money will be available by next spring . Yet the Federal Reserve has no intention of breaching its 5% to 6% long-term target for expansion of the money supply . <P> What might make Ford agree to a tax cut ? First , his political advisers might simply persuade him to override the objections of Treasury Secretary William Simon and Chief Presidential Economist Alan Greenspan , the two of whom an insider describes as " the hardest of the hardliners " on budget control . Second , there could be signs that the economy might not bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it does , that a recovery would be weak and slow . <P>
