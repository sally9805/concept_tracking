txt Forget about the Mets or Jets , the hottest team in town this year is the New York Bets . Win , place , show , or finish last , any broken-down pony that limps thru a starting gate is a money-maker for a nearly bankrupt city as long as the race Is listed at the New York Off-Track Betting Corporations 's 148 branches . " Any season at all you can drop around , you can even call the New York Bets " goes the radio jingle before former jockey Eddie Arcaro breaks in with the news on that day 's races . " So come on in and join the crowd , " the jingle runs again as Arcaro 's voice fades away . " We 're not the New York Mets , we 're not the New York Nets , we 're not the Meta , not the Jets , not the Sets . We 're the New York Bets ! " YEA BETS ! CITY fathers are cheering them all the way to the bank  --  with $66,900,000 net profit for the Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 12-month period from July , 1974 , thru June , 1975 . " Off-Track Betting has been a success in a lot of ways , " says a proud OTB official , recounting its history from the opening in April of 1971 of two branches , one in Grand Central Station on 92d Street , the other in the Borough of Queens . " We 're a good neighbor  --  and we 're the ' only winning enterprise in the city . " Not all New Yorkers , of course , agree that the presence of your friendly Off-Track Betting parlor right around the corner is necessarily a good thing . " WE 'VE IIAD COMMUNITY opposition in eight of our locations , " said Jerry Sadofsky , manager of community relations for the OM and ' the immediate butt for all complaints , " but in all the areas we 've entered , we 've caused no difficulty . " One result of the complaints of citizens ' groups was passage of a bill by the state legislature empowering Mayor Abraham Beame to appoint a five-man " site selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hold public hearings on each one . " We want to open about 16 new sites , " says Sadofsky . " The state wagering board sets a minimum distance of 200 feet from schools , churches , or synagogs . We do n't feel we corrupt anything . There 's a lot of people who want to bet . Let 's not kid ourselves . " OFFICIALS do not entertain any illusions about the real impact of Off-Track Betting on the city 's multibillion-dollar budget dilemma . " That 's $66.9 million for the city is like a Band-Aid on cancer , " admits one OTB source , " but it 's not chicken liver either . " It 's enough , in fact , to have convinced all but the most diehard opponents of legal gambling that off-track betting on horses Is here to stay  --  and could benefit financially strapped state and local governments thruout the country . " You ask why the government should get into legal gambling , " says an OTB executive , " and I can ask you to show me the illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a hospital . " As long as " the money in betting is out there , " lie goes on , " why let a bookie make it all for himself ? Why not let all the people get a share ? " WHY NOT , INDEED ? While the city fights to pay off debts and salaries , 200,000 improvers of the breed every day do their bit , as it were , by betting an average of $12 apiece thru the OM . " Dedicated to the two-dollar bettor , " says a sign in the largest OTB shop near the entrance to Penn Station . " Neither rain nor snow nor sleet nor heat nor gloom of losing can stay this faithful fan from his action at OTB . Without him we would close our doors . " Mike Mentes , the manager of that particular branch , recognizes most of the bettors  --  and knows many of them by their first names . " Same guys come in here every day , every week , " he says . " They 're average guys from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few women . They just like to play the horses . It 's fun for them . " WHILE MIKE Is talking , a Catholic priest in clerical garb walks up to one of 15 windows which were taking bets for that day on five nearby tracks  --  Monticello , Yonkers , Roosevelt , Aqueduct , and Belmont . Somberly the priest picks up a chart listing the action at Monticello ? " It 's the race for the gold ! "  --  and at Roosevelt . " I 'm not doing too bad , " says the priest when asked how they 're running . " A few weeks ago I picked up $2,000 . ' OTB is sort of exciting and amusing . All you have to remember is not to go beyond your means . You should do everything in moderation . " ? THE GOOD FATHER , reluctant to give his name , smiles when asked if he prays for his choices at morning mass . " I pray for winners , " he says , " and ' sometimes my prayers are answered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half " of his winnings to his church . " It is better to have some charitable purpose in mind , " tie sasy , " it helps make it reasonable to bet . " No matter who wins , however , the city Inevitably is the biggest winner of all . The Off-Track Betting Corporation withdraws 17 per cent of the money from the pariinutuel pool on each race and divides it among state , city , and localcommunity governments as well as the racing industry . Thus last year the OTB distributed a total of $118 million  --  Sad million to racing and $17 million to the state besides $66.9 million to New York City . THE RESULT of this sytem Is that It attracts relatively small bettors while major operators still tend to place their money illegally with bookies . The OTI3 estimates that bookies in the city still take a billion dollars worth of bets a year  --  much of it for other sporting events for which It is not possible to bet legally under any circumstances . OTB officials complain , however , that their overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional five per cent tax on all winnings . It was largely for that reason , they say , that the handle for the past fiscal year was down $13 million from the year before  --  even tho the tax earned the city another few million dollars " It 's a tax upon a tax , " says Milton Gross , a regular bettor at the OTI3 branch in Penn Station . " That five per cent break pushes some of your average bettors back to the bookie . STILL , GROSS , who describes himself as a corporation president , comes in almost every day with his copy of the Daily Racing Form in hand to place his bets . " I do fairly well , " he says , " It 's an avocation with me . My only weakness is gambling , and I call it fun . I love it . I would n't miss it , win , lose , or draw . " Nor does Gross view the recession as a factor in discouraging bettors , " The recession 's been on for a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not seen any cutback in people coming in here . " Where they come from , God knows , but they all seem to have money . "
