txt About hal ! the eligible voters of America will render final judgment tomorrow in one of the most unusual election campaigns ever waged in the middle of a Presidential term . Unless that campaign has aroused more than the customary midterm interest  --  and the indications are that it has not ? the voters will number no more than 60 million . According to this year 's census , 124,018,000 . Americans have reached voting age . Experience ? suggests that . about 47 per cent of ' these . will cast ballots for . the House , of Representatives ' and " , a.  - -  . ' slightly ' larger number for higher offices ' where possible , The voters will fill all 435 seats of the House and 35 of the 100 seats in the Senate . They will elect Governors in 35 of the 50 states and legislatures in 45 states . Much Money Spent They will ? thus ? determine which Parties . ' and , to a lesser extent , ' *WO ' : ideologies control the national legislative process . They *ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the redrawing of political boundaries in most states . before the 1972 Presidential election . More indirectly , they will pass . judgment on some of the more important political techniques and personalities that are being consciously tested in tomorrow 's balloting . The contests for Congress and control of state governments cost more money , employed more television and tried to apply more manipulative technology than ever before in midterm . In the view of many voters and . some politicians , the battles . also generated more heat  --  sometimes called " mud " ? than light on the major problems confronting the nation . A probably portentous exchange of arguments on television between President Nixon and Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine concluded the campaign this evening. ? The two men are viewed at this moment as the most likely contenders for the Presidency in 1972 . Their separate appear ? - ances exemplified the attempt of the major parties to turn thousands of political races across the union into a kind of national referendum on the policies and attitudes of the Nixon Administration . But local issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local personalities and ? electoral oddities appeared to I be influencing the voters even more . Even the so-called national issues of social unrest and economic difficulty that have been pushed to the fore ? by the Republicans and DemoOrats , respectively , have be , ' come significant factors pri'inarily where they could be related to local concerns over things like the busing of school ohildren or unemployment . Democratic Gains Seen The best estimates of the pollsters and canvassers and politicians added up to predictions that the Democrats would retain control of Congress , perhaps by a smaller margin than the present 14 in the Senate and a slightly larger margin than the present 55 in the House . The Democrats were also expected to extend their holdings pf governorships from the present 18 , possibly by as many as six or seven . Citing divergent precedents , both parties were considered likely to claim success even with such a relatively Modest shift . The fact is there is little precedent for a mid , term contest in the case of a President who came to office a plurality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote ? and who failed to carry his party to power in either branch of Congress . There is also little precedent for a midterm contest in which a politically seasoned President like Mr. Nixon played , such a vigorous role , both in public and behind the scenes . With an eye on the future strength of his party and his own chances two years hence , . Mr. Nixon set out to win control of the Senate by capturing seven seats from the Democrats to pick up a few House i ' seats f possible for a big push in 1972 and to defend the key statehouses around which future campaigns will have to be built . The President wanted to demonstrate his political muscle by punishing legislators who opposed aspects of his Vietnam and defense policies and who twice refused to approve his effort to name a conservative Southerner to the Supreme Court . With the Court issue and others , Mr. Nixon had hoped to make major new gains for Republicanism in the Southern and border states , to be able to defend himself against , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace , of Alabama . And he hoped , by emphasizing social unrest , to wean away large numbers of working-class voters in : other parts of the country whose concern about crime and violence and forced integration of schools and neighborhoods had made them restive in their traditional Democratic faith . Assist From Agnew Toward this end , Mr. Nixon personally recruited many Republican candidates for the Senate , helped them find money and technical assistance and urged them to link their campaign themes to those of the President and Vice President . Vice President Agnew , attracting great but not always favorable attention with his hard-hitting assaults on " radical liberals " ? mostly Democrats ? visited 29 states in two months , fired up party rallies and raised more than $3-million for their war chests . In swift journeys over the last fortnight , Mr. Nixon himself visited 22 states , often dominating the headlines and television screens . Mrs. Nixon , the President 's daughters , his Cabinet and aides also hit the campaign trail , , more than offsetting the interstate efforts of the Democratic National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their own future bids for national office . In recent days , much , of the campaign centered on Democratic charges that the Republicans were resorting to foul tactics in holding that their opponents were somehow responsible for crime or violent dissent . Republicans replied that the Democrats were unfair in blaming them for inflation or unemployment . Political Effect Foremost From the perspective of ' the ordinary voter , these themes were struck even more sharply in the slick and costly television commercials that were turned out in unprecedented number by the new political management industry . Combining computer analyses and polls of voter attitudes with advertising techniques , these media experts pounded home messages that glorified their patrons and often vilified their opponents , at a cost that no one has tallied yet but that some estimate to have run to_the about $60-million . The nature of the campaign and the candidacies suggest that tomorrow 's results will have much more immediate effect on ' the political life of the nation than on the policies of the national Government . Mr. Nixon 's highest priorities on the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Regardless of the election returns , he is expected to keep drawing troops out of Vietnam at a controlled pace and to aim the economy toward rapid growth and full employment by mid-1972 . He will try to have mastered both situations in time for his own reelection campaign . Republicans as well as Democrats will continue to try to spend more for different projects than the ' President believes he can afford . Members of both parties will continue to give him ? difficulty on such things as welfare reform and trade restrictions . But ' the political style of the nation over the next two years may be seriously influenced by this election . The White House must decide whether the voters really re ' sponded to ' the strong dose of partisanship served up by Mr. Nixon and Mr. Agnew . And it will have to ? decide whether it can afford to continue alienating Republican liberals like Senator Charles E. Goodell and Mayor Lindsay of New York . New Democrats Sought The Democrats , in turn , will be looking over the appeal of their leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will have to devise new ways of holding the obviously vulnerable regions of i support in the South and the once wholly loyal working-class groups elsewhere . Both parties will thus be paying special attention to the new fashion in three-way races in which alienated candidates have been refusing to yield to twoparty discipline . Mr. Nixon and Mr. Lindsay triumphed in such triangular contests in 1968 and 1969 and there are three different ideological versions of them this year in the Senate races in New York , Connecticut and Virginia . Above all , the politicians and many other interested citizens will be assessing the styles and methods of campaigning . The costs ? per , vote have now been inflated much more than the taxes and the prices about which tire candidates are complaining . Though its value is far from demonstrated , the television blitz is simply too tempting to be restrained voluntarily , even if the voters testify , as they do in many parts of the land , that it tells them little of what they care to know . If the returns are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repaying the politicians tomorrow night
