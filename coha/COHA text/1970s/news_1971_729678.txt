txt The freeze on city building that had halted $280-million worth of construction of schools , libraries , police stations and other projects was lifted yesterday by Mayor Lindsay . The freeze was imposed seven months ago as a pressure tactic to force added racial integration upon construction trade unions . The Mayor said that one union , Local 28 of the Sheetmetal Workers , still refused to bow to the city pressure . But he said agreement had been reached with the Sheetmetal Contractors Association and expressed the hope that the union would go along . " Since we 've isolated this one union they 'll either agree willingly or we 'll pursue them in course , " a Mayoral aide explained . There was no immediate reply from the union . Telephone calls to its Manhattan headquarters were answered by a long tape-recorded announcement about future union acttivities . It was not clear what city officials expected would happen the first time the sheetmetal workers were required on a city project , Presumably the union could refuse to send anyone in unless it was exempted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Earlier , the City Commission on Human Rights filed formal charges of discrimination against the union in what a commission spokesman insisted was a " separate " action not prompted by the Mayor 's office . The charges were disclosed to newsmen late Friday but withheld from publication until the weekend . They had prompted a response by Mel Farrell , the union local 's president , that such charges were both " old hat " and inaccurate . The Mayor 's announcement ending the freeze was distributed at City Hall while he was in New Hampshire attending the wedding of a member of his staff . Court Action Hinted In his prepared statement Mayor Lindsay said that if the sheetmetal local interfered with the so-called " New York Plan , " which envisions putting some 800 members of minority groups to work as construction journeymen , it would " compel the city to seek immediate sanctions in the courts . " The plan is a complicated three-way compact worked out among government , industry and unions for training and placing minority group members on public construction projects .

Members of the Lindsay staff have been hinting for weeks that they expected the pressure from other unions , whose members might be losing work because of the combination of a national recession and the city 's freeze , to force the sheetmetal local to fall into line . Just as the unions have been under pressure from members who want work , city officials have been under pressure from communities that want new schools , libraries and so forth . The freeze , imposed in February , affected all new projects calculated to cost over $100 , - 000 . Milton Musicus , the Municipal Services Administrator , who is responsible for most city construction , said that the end of the freeze would not signal an immediate start on everything that had been stopped . " We ca n't possibly process it all at once , " he said .

Inquiry inn . Charges The Human Rights Commission , in announcing its complaint against Local 28 , charged " a pattern and practice of discrimination resulting in the virtual exclusion of blacks , Puerto Ricans and other minorities from the craft . " The commission chairman , Eleanor Holmes Norton , said that a formal complaint had been filed that would permit " a full and impartial inquiry to determine if the union 's practices are unlawful . " She called , the union 's record on minority membership " incredibly poor " and cited testimony at a state hearing in March by Mr. Farrell that the local 's 3,386 members included only 44 black and Spanishsurnamed journeymen . Mr. Farrell , asked about that when the city 's complaint was disclosed , offered some other numbers for consideration .
