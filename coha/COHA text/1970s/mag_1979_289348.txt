For 48 firms : $2.6 billion <P> S Ohio 's exasperation with the environmental protection bureaucracy in California was surely understood by executives at many other companies , where " the high cost of Government regulation " has become one of the most cited sources of corporate angst . How steep is the price of meeting the proliferating demands and standards imposed by regulators ? Estimates of the annual cost of federal regulation alone to U.S. industry have ranged from $79 billion a year ( by Republican Economist Murray Weidenbaum ) to $135 billion ( by the Office of Management and Budget ) . Some Congressmen have tossed off estimates of $150 billion or more . <P> Last-week the Business Roundtable , whose members are the chief executives of some 190 of the nation 's biggest corporations , issued its long-awaited report on regulation costs . The study , conducted by the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen , was a significant measure of the actual financial impact of regulation as experienced by companies . <P> A group of 48 Roundtable member firms , among them AT &T,; General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Eastman Kodak , were examined for the added costs caused in 1977 by just six federal regulatory agencies and programs . The total : $2.6 billion , which was equal to about 16% of the companies ' net profits , 10% of their capital expenditures and 40% of their R. &; D. budgets for the year . IBM Chairman Frank Gary , who supervised the study , reckoned that the $2.6 billion figure , extrapolated to cover the whole U.S. economy , would yield an overall cost of regulation that is " not inconsistent " with Weidenbaum 's $79 billion estimate . <P> The study found the Environmental Protection Agency responsible for 77% of all the added costs , while the much criticized Occupational Safety and Health Administration accounted for only 7% . Requirements imposed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission were responsible for 8% , the Department of Energy for 5% , the Employee Retirement Income Security Act for 2% and the Federal Trade Commission for 1% . <P> The study did not examine the benefits of regulation or secondary costs , like losses due to construction delays caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary , IBM 's Cary also noted that the study showed plainly that the resulting expenditures can " often be wasteful and nonproductive . " He urged that companies be given more latitude over how to achieve goals and argued that economic impact statements , in which the financial burden of new rules would have to be weighed against their benefits , " should become a way of life .
