The dog may well be urban man 's worst friend . The beast in the city jungle chews children , attacks joggers and howls into the night in a cramped apartment that makes it neurotic . When it does get out-twice a day , if its master can manage-it turns street and sidewalk alike into messy booby traps for pedestrians . The brassy blonde in the film Midnight Cowboy said it all when she coaxed her toy poodle : " Do it for mama . " <P> In cities throughout the world , dogs are fast becoming the most obnoxious minority group . There are 280,000 of them in Tokyo , 300,000 in Los Angeles , 500,000 in New York City , 700,000 in London , and more than a million in Mexico City ( including strays ) . And they are all " doing it " - on sidewalks and park lawns , against fire hydrants and defenseless city tree trunks . In Manhattan recently , one proud brownstone owner was on his knees watering his few flowers when he suddenly felt his bald pate being used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dog , its owner whipped out a police badge and threatened to arrest him for disorderly conduct . <P> Innocent Victims . The trouble is that cities are full of lonely people who rely on dogs as substitute friends , spouses and children . Many a furnished room contains a small human and a huge Great Dane or similar beast . Some homosexuals use exotic breeds as props for pickups . In Manhattan 's Riverside Park , one eccentric spinster used to talk incessantly to her aged dachshund while wheeling it about in a baby carriage . An indignant father once tried to embarrass her by having his toddler wear a dog muzzle , to no avail . <P> Beyond all that , city dogs are supposed to repel burglars and muggers ; high-crime areas now teem with Doberman pinschers and German shepherds . But who protects the innocent from the protectors ? Last year Tokyo recorded about 5,000 complaints of dog bites from newsboys , mailmen , salesmen and bill collectors . New York 's bite toll hit 25,000 . Britons are so worried about rabies that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The isolation period for the pets now in quarantine under old laws has been extended from six months to a year . Rabies is an even worse worry in Lima , Peru , which has as many dogs as it has people . Americans may soon face another problem . A new boom in " attack dogs " is creating protectors trained ( for as much as $4,000 ) to maim or kill marauders , but there are already cases of robbers using their own dogs to subdue victims . <P> Filth City . The most docile dogs irk city dwellers by tripping strollers with long leashes , muddying lobbies , preempting elevators and perpetually sniffing people . Dogs can give humans tuberculosis , create allergies and cause assorted eye and intestinal infections . New York Post Columnist Pete Hamill , a relentless dog baiter , speaks for many in labeling his town " Filth City . " As he puts it : " Nobody can tell me that all those piles left around the streets are good for us , no matter how many burglars are scared off when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , are not so much the dogs as their owners . Cities abound with curb-your-dog signs ; those near Manhattan 's U.N . building deliver the message in four languages . But who heeds them ? Owners know that cops are often too busy even to enforce the laws requiring leashes.
