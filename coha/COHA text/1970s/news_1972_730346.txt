txt Senator George stood firm today against mounting pressure from some of his supporters to drop his VicePresidential running mate , Senator Thomas F. Eagleton . I Although they denied vigorously that the replacement of the Missouri Senator was even under consideration , the Democratic nominee and his leading advisers both here at his Black Hills vacation retreat and in Washington were obviously seriously assessing the impact on their campaign against President Nixon of Senator Eagleton 's surprise disclosures yesterday . At a news conference at Sylvan Lake Lodge with Senator yesterday , Mr. Eagleton revealed that he had been hospitalized three times between 1960 and 1900 for nervous exhaustion and depression and had twice undergone electric shock treatment . Denies Reconsidering Angered at a ward service report that he interpreted as indicating that he might reconsider his initial decision to keep Mr , Eagleton on the ticket , Mr. issued s statement today declaring : " This is utterly Untrue , Z em 1,000 per cent for Tom Eagleton and have no intention of dropping him from the ticket . This is what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misunderstanding on my position . " Richard Dougherty , the press spokesman here , flatly denied a televised report that Senator had asked Senator Eagleton to withdraw from the ticket . Issue for G.O.P. The nominee 's strong statements , however , did not silence all of those who thought Senator Eagleton 's disclosures would hand the Republicans an issue and badly damage the Democrats ' chances in the fall . Among others urging Mr. Eagleton 's removal or withdrawal from the ticket was Matthew J. Troy Jr. , , the Queens Councilman and Democratic county chairman , who is also a top adviser . In a telegram from New York to the Missouri Senator , Mr. Troy contended that " your presence on the ticket could mean the difference between victory and defeat . " " As distasteful as this may seem coming from someone who admires you very much , " he continued , " I am now call // ing on you , despite Senator 's protestations to the contrary , to voluntarily resign your nomination and permit our party to put this issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether Senator would make a better candidate and not on whether you are qualified and capable to serve as Vice President . " While Senator spent what a spokesman described as a quiet day in his cabin at the lodge , there was some evidence that it was not entirely relaxed and carefree . Mr. Troy told newsmen in New York that he had received a call from Mr. asking his recommendations on the problem of the Eagleton candidacy . He said that the nominee was seeking advice from all members of his advisory staff on the situation . Mr. Dougherty said he could not confirm or deny this . At a news briefing , however , Mr. Dougherty did give some indication of the type of pressure that was being put on Senator . " We 've had ? reports from some of our financial people that this is dismaying news for the fund-raising , " he said in discussing the impact of the Eagleton revelations . " Senator thinks this will smooth out , " he added . Checks today among some traditional Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnesota or other primary candidates and are now being wooed by the people indicated that the Eagleton disclosures had made them even more cautious about aiding the national ticket . Mr. was also receiving some telegrams from grass - roots supporters and others urging him to remove Senator Eagleton from the ticket . Although staff members here said they had no count from their Washington office , sentiments were running about two to one against Mr. Eagleton in the 30 or so messages sent to Sylvan Lake . Wary of ' Credibility ' Typical of those in opposition was one that read : " Please drop Eagleton . His not revealing problems before selection tarnishing ticket credibility . " An editorial in the liberal New York Post echoed the same theme . It said that because of Mr. Eagleton 's failure to tell Mr. of his past health problems before his nomination , " his continued presence on the ticket can only produce cruel diversionary conflicts in a year when real issues should be sharply defined and debated . " The editorial went on to declare that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we believe that Eagleton should withdraw . " Meanwhile , at a breakfast with newsmen in Washington , Gary Hart , Senator 's national campaign manager , said that the question of Senator Eagleton 's leaving the ticket was " foreclosed . " But then he seemed to leave the door ajar a crack by saying that would be the case unless Mr. Eagleton decided that it was in his best interest and in the interest of the ticket to withdraw . In the event that Senator Eagleton should withdraw , members of the Democratic National Committee would be called into session to select a replacement . Each state would have votes to cast proportionate to its share of delegates to the recent national convention . Such an action has only happened once , in 1912 , when James S. Sherman , William Howard Taft 's Republican running mate , died on Oct. 30 . The Republican National Committee was hurriedly summoned and selected Nicholas Murray Butler , president of Columbia University , as a replacement . Taft lost the election to Woodrow I Wilson . Last-Minute Debate The rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hart or Frank Mankiewicz , national coordinator of the campaign . During discussions on the day the Missouri Senator was selected in Miami Beach , they were brought up at a staff meeting that was trying to narrow the field of Vice-Presidential possibilities . Gordon Weil , another aide , made some telephone inquiries at that time and reported back to the staff that the reports were without substance . Mr. Weil was said to have called newsmen who had covlered Senator Eagleton and po-1 litical leaders who had known l him well in the short time he had to check out the rumors about the candidate . Senator was also reported to have talked with Senate colleagues about the stories they had circulated about the Missourian . Both were said to have been convinced that there was nothing damaging in Mr. Eagleton 's past , a position that Mr. continues to maintain . Mr. Hart said today that ? there had been discussion in the top circles of the camIpaign up until the last two or three days as to whether Senator Eagleton should remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , he said , " what are the alternatives ? " He said that the staff and Mr. discussed all the alternatives including disclosure and that was an alternative " that all of us agreed on . " , Mr. Hart said that he did not think the campaign 's credibility had been impaired by the disclosure . However , he conceded that the case might have been different if news stories " had gotten out and we were in the posture of making comments about something in the public domain . " Senator Eagleton said at his news conference yesterday that one of the reasons for his disclosure of his past health problems had been increasing linquiries about them from I newsmen . He also said that while het had not told Senator ' of the problems when asked before his selection whether there was anything in his past that might cause difficulties , the nominee had been informed by the Monday after the Democratic National Convention . Today , a spokesman said that the two men had not discussed Mr. Eagleton 's health problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Mankiewicz had learned of them while vacationing in the Virgin Islands early last week . He and Douglas Bennett , an Eagleton aide , were said to have discussed them at that time . Mr. also was reported to have been told then of inquiries that were being made by newsmen . Robert Soya , Washington bureau chief of the Knight Newspapers , said today that his organization had received a tip on July 17 from a person he would not identify about Mr. Eagleton 's hospitalizations . The person , he said , identified himself as a supporter and said that he had also passed the word on to Mr. Hart and Mr. Mankiewicz . On Sunday , Mr. Boyd said , in an attempt to get comment from the camp he gave a memorandum to Mr. Mankiewicz detailing what had been learned of Mr. Eagleton 's medical past . The memorandum is understood to have been shown to Senator . However , Mr. said later that it was not until his breakfast session with Mr. Eagleton yesterday that he learned the complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was at that breakfast , he said , that the decision was made to disclose them immediately .
