Archaeologists long ago concluded that man first began to farm around 7500 B.C. in the Middle East 's Fertile Crescent . Other excavations have shown that he also acquired agricultural skills at roughly the same time in what is now Mexico and Central America . More recent discoveries by members of a University of Hawaii expedition in northern Thailand may well push the birth of agriculture even farther back . The Thai evidence suggests that peoples of Southeast Asia tilled the soil more than 2,000 years before anyone began to farm in the Middle East or the Americas . <P> Old Chestnuts . Clues to the existence of the ancient Asian farmers first came to light in 1965 when Chester Gorman , a Hawaii graduate student , poked into a cavern called Spirit Cave by the Thais : it had served as home for untold generations of farmers and was filled with relics of their handiwork . In a thorough excavation the expedition has since found crude Stone Age tools and a number of ancient seeds-peas , beans , cucumbers and Chinese water chestnuts - of a size and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Using radioactive dating methods based on the decay of the isotope carbon 14 , scientists have estimated the seeds to be as much as 11,700 years old ; the same tests on ancient grain samples found in the Middle East or Latin America show that none are more than 9,500 years old . Thus , says the director of the University of Hawaii expedition . Anthropologist Wilhelm G. Solheim II . Thailand 's ancient inhabitants may well have been the world 's first farmers . <P> Early Rice . Other scientists suggest that agriculture developed more or less simultaneously in widely separated regions of the world . Carbon-14 dating techniques , they note , can easily be off by as much as 1,000 years . But Solheim 's claim is at least indirectly supported by other evidence of Southeast Asia 's prehistoric culture . At the historic Thai village of Non Nok Tha , another University of Hawaii archaeological team has discovered a 3,500-year-old metal ax with a socket for a handle . The unusual implement may show that Thailand 's ancient people were able to make tools as sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably working with bronze at least 1,000 years before the Chinese-who were previously thought to have taught them the skill . <P> The Non Nok Tha team also discovered old pottery fragments imprinted with rice husk markings . The shards indicate that the inhabitants of the region were cultivating rice even earlier than 3500 B.C.-long before it was grown in either India or China . " The Chinese , " says Solheim. " have felt superior to the peoples beyond their borders . Now they will have to accept the fact that many of the peoples of Southeast Asia had a higher culture from which the Chinese borrowed for the foundations of their later civilization .
