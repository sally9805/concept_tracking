Since the contract was first awarded , the firm has grossed almost $2 million . When Daley was asked if he was upset about the disclosures , he answered , " Certainly , it would upset anyone to have a relationship with a man for 20 years and then find out something like this has been going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office to study the Dell contract to see if it can be terminated . Pressed for further comment on the Bush matter , Daley said , " It 's an unfortunate and sad incident , but there is an investigation going on and you know my policy since I 've been mayor .

The IRS then turned its files over to a special Corruptions Unit in the U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines that other federal statutes may have been violated by Bush . ? Bush originally recommended to a special city advisory committee that the Dell firm receive the contract without telling committee members of his connection with the company .
