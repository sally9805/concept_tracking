Before killing herself in 1969 , Takako Nakamura wrote : " The pains gnaw at my body . I want to throw out my stomach and intestines . " Read aloud to Japan 's hushed Diet last month , those words moved Prime Minister Eisaku Sato to tears . Takako Nakamura has become a symbol of the tragic results of Japan 's unchecked pollution . <P> At 18 , Takako became a lathe operator at a cadmium smelter near her home in Annaka , a city on the main island of Honshu . When she began suffering mysterious pains in 1961 , no one even thought to blame cadmium . As protection against the toxic metal , which is widely used for electroplating , she wore special rubber clothing . Doctors diagnosed her ailment as " intestinal ulcers . " But even eight years after she switched to clerical work , the pain continued .

Seeking clues , health officials finally exhumed Takako 's body last month and performed an autopsy . The results shocked the nation . By current Japanese standards , a reading of one part per million of cadmium is harmful to humans . Takako 's liver contained 4,540 p.p.m. , her kidneys 22,400 p.p.m . Scientists speculated that she breathed cadmium particles and fumes generated by the plant 's smelting process , and pointed out that a major symptom of such poisoning , decalcification of bones , is not detectable by X ray until the bones have lost about 30% of their calcium . <P> Spirit and Suicide . Prime Minister Sato has ordered health checks on all workers in the more than 1,000 Japanese plants that use cadmium-a crucial step , since only a handful of those plants take adequate safety precautions . Last week health officials reported that cadmium has tainted much of the country 's rice .

" I would like to stop using cadmium , " he said in a farewell note , " but I can not . I am assuming full responsibility and choosing death . " Some U.S. scientists now rank cadmium ahead of lead as a dangerous pollutant . It is a prime candidate for a list of toxic substances that the federal Environmental Protection Agency will publish this month and for which it will set emission limits .
