" Killer amendments " ahead ? <P> <P> After Jimmy Carter and Leonid Brezhnev sign the SALT II treaty next week , it goes before the Senate for a ratification debate that will range over the whole relationship between the world 's two superpowers . To help clarify some of the complex issues , TIME last week convened a panel of experts for an all-day conference in Manhattan . Among them were two of the key Senate staff members now polishing arguments for the showdown on the floor : Richard Perle , 37 , a former consultant to the Defense Department , adviser to SALT Critic Henry Jackson of Washington and widely considered to be the best informed opponent of SALT in Senate staff circles , and Larry Smith , 43 , for four years a strategic affairs specialist on the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee and now administrative assistant to SALT Supporter Gary Hart of Colorado . Their forceful views suggested an important conclusion : instead of a simple either/or verdict , the Senate outcome may well turn on whether amendments can be devised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of negotiations with the Soviets . Perle himself made it plain that the foes of SALT are likely to use amendments as the primary way to attack the treaty , with a reopening of negotiations as the ultimate goal . A summary : <P> Perle : We 're Falling Behind . The principal worry about SALT , Perle repeated over and over , is that the treaty as now drafted would permit the Soviets to continue their menacing strategic-arms buildup , while lulling the U.S. into a false sense of security that would prevent it from spending enough on defense . Said he : " In the last decade the Soviets have spent on strategic forces roughly $100 billion more than the U.S. has spent . We have seen an enormous shift in the strategic balance . In virtually every category in which the Soviets were behind a decade ago , they are now ahead . " SALT II , he believes , would do less to limit than to legitimize that buildup : " While it is true that the Soviets will in certain particulars be constrained from doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is enough freedom in the treaty to let them continue to invest in strategic forces at the rate at which they have been investing . " <P> On the U.S. side , he contends , " the legalistic interpretation of the treaty that says that all of our research and development programs can go forward misses the fundamental point . They are not going to go forward . We ca n't go to the country and ask for the kind of increase in effort that is required , after having gone to the country to explain that this arms-control agreement is going to stabilize U.S.-Soviet relations and bring the strategic competition under control .
