The news from Istanbul fell like a bomb on a gathering in Houston 's Rice Hotel last week . There the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America was holding a formal dinner as part of its 21st Biennial Clergy-Laity Congress . Archbishop Iakovos , Primate of North and South America , rose to give a scheduled speech about the Ecumenical Patriarch , then told the delegates in a breaking voice : " Athenagoras is not with us any more . He is with God . " The Patriarch 's death was especially poignant because the congress was celebrating a " Double Jubilee , " Athenagoras ' 50th year as a bishop and the 50th anniversary of the American archdiocese . The congress immediately adjourned in mourning , but it had already heard the most important message-a plea from Iakovos for Greek Orthodoxy in the Americas to take on a heroic new spiritual tone . <P> In its first half-century , the archdiocese has grown prosperous and large : twelve subordinate dioceses scattered through the hemisphere , some 480 parishes and an estimated 2,000,000 members ( 1.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address to the Congress , the soft-voiced , gray-bearded Iakovos , now 60 , sounded no note of triumph . Greek Orthodoxy in the Americas , he said , needs to add " truth and love " to the " enthusiasm , ambition and pride " that have been its " principal attributes " to date . It needs , he said , to return to the " meaning of Christianity , " to " become more of a church than we are . " <P> The Iakovos of Houston-evangelical , reformist , emphasizing his points with exhortations from the Apostle Paul - seemed something of a departure from the ambitious hierarch who has made himself so visible on the ecumenical circuit in his 13 years as Primate of the Americas . " I have not always talked this way , " he conceded in an interview with TIME 'S Mayo Mohs . For years his passion was ecumenism , his hope to lead a union of the Orthodox churches in the U.S. But now , says Iakovos , " the trend is not to fight for power and supremacy : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Cleansing Agent . Too many Greek Orthodox congregations have become what Iakovos admits are " social clubs labeled with the name of a saint , " a fact that many of his church members are beginning to recognize . In a survey of American-born parishioners last fall , Iakovos found , the " greatest need " cited by 87% of the respondents was for " more religious enlightenment and edification . " The Orthodox , says Iakovos , " must not be afraid to break away from the masses , " must become less secular , less materialistic , more concerned with the real meaning behind the formalities of their faith . <P> Iakovos wants Greek Orthodoxy to become a cleansing agent for a sick society . " Without spiritual strength and invincible faith , " he says , " I do n't think we can correct any of the ills of our society .
