THE DISINHERITED : Journal of a Palestinian Exile . tBy Fawaz Turki . Monthly Review Press . 156 pp. $5.95 . THE FACE OF DEFEAT : Palestinian Refugees and Guerrillas . By David PryceJones . Holt , Rinehart and Winston . 192 pp. $5.95 . LEONARD KRIEGEL little to lose but their boredom . Nor was it the fault of the Israeli soldiers , whose characteristically unmilitant reaction to their victories was movingly recorded in The Seventh Day . The process of adoption was simple enough . One merely exchanged the once fashionable cause of Jewish " redemption " for the current cause of Palestinian " redemption . " And one indulged in Maoist slogans , large generalizations , and a self-conscious cruelty in which the Zionist took the place of the Jew as the necessary pariah . ' And yet , even as one expresses con , tempt for those who are now dropping the Palestinians , for more fashionable The liberation of Western intellectuals from the uncomfortable burdens of philoSemitism , borne so uncomplainingly since the revelations about the final solution began , to filter out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Israeli military triumph now known as the Six Day War . , Israeli military power swept through the Western psyche almost as efficiently as it swept through the Sinai Desert , leaving behind a significant number of ' radicalized intellectuals in whom an amorphous philo-Semitism was now enveloped by an equally amorphous anti-Zionism . History has many cunning corridors ; some of them seem to have become echo chambers . Sartre did not have a Sovietized Poland in mind when he wrote of how the anti-Semite would be forced to invent the Jew if he did not have him . And even the most fervently anti-Zionist Jewish radical must be touched by the terror of memory when he hears of young German " revolutionaries " speaking about their need to get over " this Jewish thing . " Whether it is Israel that has made Jews once again unfashionable or the Jews who have made Israel , unfashionable seems to me a point warranting more discussion than it has yet received . In any case , soon after the Six Day War , the cause of the Palestinians had drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Palestinian refugees suddenly found themselves " mascots for the cause-mongers over their shoulders , for the cinema teams of modish young bullies , with fierce hair and girls in tailored denims , for the anonymous promoters who ride in cars with CD plates , the perpetual expense-account set , those who mount someone else 's cause on someone else 's money . " David PryceJones might have added that they have a habit of spilling someone else 's blood , too . In any case , it was not the fault of the refugees that they were embraced by the cinema-verite enthusiasts who had causes , the tragic dilemma which David Pryce-Jones describes as " the unbearable symmetry of one nation of refugees establishing itself on top of another " remains the legacy of Palestinian and Israeli alike . If the rhetoric grows increasingly hollow and the inhumanity of the " liberators " ' grows increasingly apparent ( " Do n't get me wrong , " pleads- The New Yorker staff writer after he has chortled over the fedayeen 's " success " at last year 's Olympic Games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anti-Semite . " ) , the ' camps and all that the camps represent transcend rhetoric . They are the reality with which all of us must deal . The fedayeen will continue to be praised by those for whom their impotence must remain a source of bewilderment . The paradox of people who call themselves Socialists trying to convince themselves that Yasser Arafat , his credentials established by the reactionary Moslem Brotherhood , is a " radical " leader as he goes begging to King Faisal of Saudi Arabia , makes sense only in a world in which the conservative board chairmen of major oil companies ally themselves with the stalwarts of the Third World in their antipathy to " Zionist Israel . " In the upside-down world of the Middle East , the Israelis have established a theocratic state , whereas ' Arafat Qaddafi and Faisal are apparently the true democrats . Still , by now it should be apparent even to journalists who breathe the rarified air of The New Yorker that Israel is not going to be defeated by the Palestinian guerrilla army . As Marx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital is to the profit ledger . If the Israelis are ever driven into the sea , it will not be because of the rhetoric of Ahmed Shukeiry or Yasser Arafat . Oil is to the world what cotton was to the ante-bellum Southern United States . That world has been savage to the Palestinians . Any book which seeks to clarify their situation must be welcomed . But the paradox of their situation is that it is difficult to see them as they see themselves . Both of these books deal with the Palestinians and their problems , but to read them together is to see again how easily the political mind is capable of self-deception . Fawaz Turki is a Palestinian , and his voice in The Disinherited is the voice of exile . David Pryce-Jonesis an English novelist and journalist , who brings to his work a refined eye and an obvious compassion for both sides in the Arab-Israeli struggle . He himself has no quick and easy solutions to the enormous Leonard Kriegel is the author of Edmund Wilson ( Southern dllinois University Press ) . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in that struggle . What we discover in The Disinherited and The Face , of Defeat are the same events seen from angles of vision which are not merely different but probably irreconcilable . Turki has been dispossessed and his anger at Nasser and his fellow " Arabs " is more scathing than his anger at Golda Meir and the Israelis . That is perhaps the sole perspective he and Pryce-Jones share . Fawaz Turki wishes to " isolate our problem from the Arab-Israeli dispute . " Pryce-Jones tells us that the problem is no longer even historical . The Arab-Israeli struggle has created its own mythology ; it is no longer " a matter ' for the record and may never be until it is as legendary as Moses ' crossing of the Red Sea and the drowning of Pharaoh 's chariots . " Truth and reality are not merely arguable  --  they are , in a manner of speaking , functionally nonexistent . " Propaganda , which may nonetheless be the truth , or may have become the truth or even more than truth , , appeals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . " Turki quotes Menachem Begin and bewails the fate of the Palestinians massacred at Deir-Yassin ; Pryce-Jones remembers Deir-Yassin but he also remembers Shukeiry 's threats and the massacres at Ben Jehuda Street or the Mandate massacre of the Jews of Hebron . Arafat is Turki 's living symbol of " the New Palestinians , " while PryceJones can scarcely contain his contempt for this " real now-man " who decorates " the cover of Time magazine . " When Fawaz Turki speaks directly about his life in The Disinherited , the book is a deeply moving document . He is another of the vast legion of the 20th century 's homeless and exiled . Tracing his descent into shame as he finds himself an outcast in the eyes of the world and a pariah in the eyes of his fellow Arabs , he discovers regeneration in recognizing himself as a Palestinian , The source of his dispossession is less important than its reality . Arguments about whether his family and his fellow Palestinians were driven out by Israeli armies or by the promises of Arab heads of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruitless and academic , just as the question of whether or not the Palestinians constitute a nation has become academic , A people becomes a nation when a consciousness of itself as a nation takes root . And the evidence in both of these books affirms that the Israelis are eventually going to have to make some accommodation with the Palestinians , whose own consciousness of themselves has taken on an increasingly " Zionist " tone , one that sometimes seems to have been lifted from the painful pages of Diaspora literature . Reading The Disinherited , one understands better what David Pryce-Jones means When he writes : Whatever the rights of the Israelis , Arabs once possessed Palestine . Whatever the rights of the Arabs , Israelis now possess it . Instead of ghettos , these camps . Instead of an identity , a diaspora . " Our hope is not yet lost to return to the land of our fathers . " So begins the Israeli national anthem but its sentiment is Palestinian . The subject revolves , ' like history itself , looking for a solution , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Identity alone proves to be insufficient . Solutions offered are already embalmed in revolutionary romanticism . The fedayeen and their supporters quote Mao and Che and Ho Chi Minh  --  himself once an admirer of the Israelis  --  but as PryceJones notes , and as even some fedayeen Will admit , in the deserts of Israel and Jordan , " Maoist theory has been tested and found wanting . " Golda Meir is not a Thieu , Dayan is not a Ky , and the Israeli population is not waiting to be " liberated . " Fawaz Turki concludes his book , Which is personal in its appeal , with a chapter title that repeats Lenin 's famous " What Is to Be Done ? " It is here that he is forced ' into a rhetorical eloquence Which , whether intentionally or not , disguises the fact that he is not on very solid ground . He remains a Third World revolutionary who does n't quite believe in that future he has outlined for himself and for others . It is the others , both Jew and Arab , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One wonders what his reaction is ' to the emergence of , ? uch oil-rich anachronisms as Faisal and Qaddafi in the Arab world . The problem of the guerrillas is that they have grown dependent upon such " spokesmen " even as men such as Turki condemn the " trap of racism and blind hate in which both Zionists and Arabs were caught . " There is an Israeli joke ? " If Moses had made a right instead of a left , we would have had the oil and they would have had the scenery " ? which Palestinians could quote with ironic approval . Within the Arab world , the Palestinians are essentially suppliants . To write , " The fate of the West Bank , the Gaza Strip , Jerusalem , and the national destiny of the Palestinian people is an exclusively Palestinian concern , " is one thing ; to create an atmosphere in which that " exclusive concern " is recognized by others is quite another . Concern in the 20th century remains the prerogative of power , and power , as Jewish history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of morality . For the present , the fedayeen are relatively ineffectual . As an armed force , they have been thoroughly beaten both by the Israelis and Hussein 's legions . The cause-mongers ' and the cinema teams have disappeared from their camps . They have made significant gains only in the area of world opinion , but , one of the other lessons of Jewish history is that world opinion is not all it is cracked up to be . After having created , at least in part , the Palestinian cause and kept it alive throughout the 1950s , the Arab states now suspect that the cause of the Palestinians may not be the cause of the Arabs . Jordan wants the West Bank for itself , not for an independent Palestinian state ; Egyptian rhetoric demands the liberation of Egyptian territory , not the handing over of Sinai to the dispossessed masses of Gaza ; and the Israelis , fearful of being sold out in the name of oil , and conscious of the realities of Jewish history , strive desperately to make themselves militarily self-sufficient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it haunts the entire Third World . Each of these books seems to me excellent , and each of them should be read by anyone who wishes to see the dimensions of a problem which has caused so many men of good will to give in to hopelessness and despondency . How did it come about that a whole nation found itself suddenly in exile and its two million people afflicted by defeat , hunger , and humiliation , repudiated by , men , despised by host countries and forgotten by the world , left to live as pariah refugees , their disinherited souls empty of hope and devoid of meaning ? How did it come about that they accepted with a stoic calm the vagaries of homelessness and the agonies of destitution ? How did it come about that , a versatile and ingenious people continued for many years to provoke , in their lifestyle and attitudes , identification with backwardness , illiteracy , stagnation , and an inability or , unwillingness to transcend their plight ? Why is it that they created a space around themselves which left no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or through it ? Fawaz Turki does not mean these sentences to be either . ironic or rhetorical . ' But how else can is Jew , no matter how sympathetic he may be to the Palestinian people , read them ? For me , and for so many Jews of my generation , both those who consider themselves Zionists and those at - variance with Zionism , the Holocaust is the central event of 20th-century history . It is not merely that it denies the liberal humanistic cliches we were brought up to believe but it created a condition into which we , rather than the rest of the world , were plunged . That is why the re-emergence of Russian anti-Semitism boomS so loudly in those historical corridors . For . Fawaz Turki , on the other hand , the , tiolocaust can be summed up in the phrase , " the tragedy of the concentration camps . " For Turki , the Holocaust can be only a statistic , for he can no more permit it to enter his mind as a reality than I can permit the spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Turki , Zionism is the Manichean creature of Theodore Herzl 's " European " mentality . In Amos Elon 's study , The Israelis , he notes how unreal the Arab inhabitants of Palestine were to those young Jewish Socialists who came not to a country ' but to a dream of redemption . In Zionist thought , the people without a land had returned . to their land without its people . Their blindness was to produce tragic consequences , but one can no more blame them than ' one can blame the second and the third genera , tion of Palestinian refugees who dream of recovering mythical estates in a land " stolen " from their fathers and grandfathers . A balance of terror may be provided by Palestinians and Jews , but one searches in vain for a balance of truth . The Israelis are now as ' unreal to the Palestinians as the Arabs were to the early Zionist settlers . And yet , one must somehOw get beyond the despair , the hopelessness , the excruciating ironies of Middle Eastern ' politics . The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made bearable . ' Those among us who claim to believe in the rights of all peoples to self-determination tend to create open-and-shut situations in our own minds . Politics imitates life in at least one particular  --  it is never quite so clear cut . Confronted by Israelis , Palestinians , Biafrans , Nigerians , all of them demanding what we are theoretically so willing to give , we squirm within our own confusions . Justice for one side turns out to mean oppression for the other . We are not helped by the hollowness of Third World rhetoric or its extravagant political gestures : Castro , now as much a beggar for Soviet largesse as Arafat is for Arab oil largesse , breaks relations with Israel  --  while , no doubt , from the air-conditioned luxury of his Third World nonaligned Algerian resort hotel , General Amin , that admirer of Hitler , applauds . One can only hope that ultimately the , voices of all " native sons " will be heard in the Middle East . Fawaz Turki can be heard in New York , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ever be heard in Cairo and Riyadh .
