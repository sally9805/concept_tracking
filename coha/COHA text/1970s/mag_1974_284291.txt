The economic news was about as bad as a party in power could imagine for a pre-election week . The U.S. unemployment rate in October climbed to 6% , the highest in almost three years and a rate exceeded only slightly and rarely since 1961 . The Government 's index of leading indicators-those that serve as clues to the future direction of the economy-fell 2.5% in September , its sharpest drop in more than 23 years .

But taken together , the week 's indicators sketched a distressingly clear picture of a rapidly weakening economy .
