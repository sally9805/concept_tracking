THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment FOR some time , we have been un- easy about the prayer services held on occasional Sundays at the ) , Vhite House . The sermon at the latest one was delivered by Billy Graham , and among the three hundred and fifty guests  --  described by the President as " an elite group " ? were Judge Clement Haynsworth , who was assured by Mr. Nixon that the revivalist preacher was " one of your supporters , " and Judge Julius Hoffman . Both the President 's use of a religious occasion to bring up the subject of one Supreme Court nomination while another was pending before the Senate and his implicit support of a judicial decision that is before the courts struck us as questionable extensions of Presidential power . A couple of days after the event , we learned from a black man who is a friend of ours that he had been even more troubled by the occasion , because he and his wife had been invited to attend it . Since a White House invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's command , he felt that it was proper to accept it , and did . Then , thinking over the propriety , or impropriety , of such services from both a general and a personal viewpoint , he decided that he had been wrong , and wrote to the President to explain his position . With his permission , we quote his letter : DEAR MR . PRESIDENT : This is written to explain my earlier acceptance but later refusal of the kind invitation which you and Mrs. Nixon tendered to my wife and to me to attend worship services at the White House on Sunday , March 15 . Clearly , in a civilized nation , - when the Chief of State asks a citizen to do anything , the citizen is not only flattered by the attention but is also anxious to respond in the most positive way . These feelings account for my acceptance when your social secretary tendered your invitation . However , on later reflection , two other , much more serious considerations seemed to me to outweigh my earlier impulse . The Erst is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state and I have had serious doubts as to the wisdom of holding worship services in the White House since you instituted that practice . My reservations on this matter alone are so strong that I am unable to participate in such a service . Secondly , the policies which have been pursued by your Administration with regard to the status of blacks in our society contravene most of what I have learned in my professional career and have come to feel as a black man living in the American society all my life . I believe that , for the most part , your policies are not only misguided , that they not only alienate great masses of black Americans , hut , worst of all , that they crush the hopes , the spirits , and the beliefs of millions of citizens of this Republic . Feeling strongly , as 1 du , it would he most hypocritical of me to accept your tender of hospitality . . hedge Dillard BETWEEN the time the Haynsworth controversy ended and the Carswell controversy began , another Southerner was appointed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ august than our Supreme Court  --  the . International Court of Justice , at The Hague , which , since it adjudicates disputes between sovereign nations , can he said to be the supreme supreme court On earth . The World Court is a branch of the United Nations , and the new judge , who was elected by the Security Council and the General Assembly , is Hardy Cross Dillard , James Monroe Professor and former Dean of the Law School of the University of Virginia , at Charlottesville . Judge Dillard recently started a nine-year term at The Hague , succeeding Judge Philip C. Jessup , an old friend of his . " Every-body in the field of international law knows everybody else , like tax lawyers and labor lawyers , " Judge Dillard told us the other day , when we got him aside for a chat during a trip he made to the city . He is a big , bluff , engaging man of sixty-seven , his face crosshatched with fine wrinkles . " I owe my nomination to a Czar of Russia . " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1899 , convened a meeting at The Hague out of which evolved the Permanent Court of Arbitration , a **25;3822;TOOLONG body , one of whose functions has been to nominate international judges . The United States has four men on the Court of Arbitration  --  former Attorney General Herbert Brownell , the former State Department legal advisers Herman Phleger and John Stevenson , and Professor Richard Baxter , of the Harvard Law School  --  and last summer they informed Judge Dillard that they were going to propose him for the World Court seat that the United States has customarily occupied . " I was astonished , " Judge Dillard told us . " I am the first to say that I can mime a dozen people who could do a better job than I could . Accordingly , I have approached the job in a spirit of exuberant humility . I have a lot to learn . " The appointment to The Hague is nonpolitical . Judge Dillard has only the most casual acquaintance with President Nixon , and , in fact , he is a Democrat . He was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardy Dil-lard , a classics scholar , after whom Dillard University , a New Orleans college fur Ne-groes , was named . Dillard pater was one of the first white Southerners to show concern about Negro education , He gave up being Dean of Tulane to run two foundations set up to further Negro education . " My father was a remarkable man , " the new judge told us . " I 've seen him do the Times Sunday crossword in fifteen minutes . When he left Tulane , his friends thought he was crazy . White people did n't understand Negroes then . It was a different world . We moved toChar-lottesville in 1914 , when I was twelve , and doubt if there was a Negro in town with a complete suit of clothes . " At sixteen , young Dillard entered the University of Virginia , a few miles from home . but after a year lie received an appointment to West Point and transferred . " I have no idea , really , why I applied in the first place , " he told us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kul . After I got a telegram notifying the I 'd been accepted , I called on Senator Carter Glass to try to get a postponement of my appointment . I rang his doorbell , and when he let me in I said , ' Sir , I 'm one of your constituents , and I just learned I 've been appointed to the Military Academy and I 'd like to talk to you about postponing my appointment . ' Young man , you get the hell up there , ' the Senator said , ' Fifty fellows in Virginia could have gone if you had n't prempted the spot ' So I went . " Judge Dillard has literan leanings  --  he has been chairman of the hoard of advisory editors of the Virginia Quarterly Review , and lie sometimes identifies obscure lines of poetry for stumped readers of the Times  --  which he attributes largely to a West Point professor , a Major Chilton , who , among other things , had his students convert selections from the Bible into iambic pentameter . Cadet Dillard was also impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy . So when he graduated , in 1924 , he decided to go to law school . The Armi did n't mind ; it then had more t ming officers hanging around than it had places for . Dillard returned to Charlottesville and enrolled in the University of Virginia Law School . He has been based at Charlottesville ever since , but has wandered off , at one time or another , to lecture on international law at The Hague , in West Germany , England , and Egypt , and at Columbia University . When he left Columbia , his students gave him a loving cup inscribed " We have met the enemy , and we are his . " Meanwhile , he got married , to a minister 's daughter who was an art student and a former apPrentice dancer with Isadora Duncan , and whom he met in Paris . " I sometimes say that I picked my wife up at the 1 ) eux-Magots , but that is n't really true , and , besides , she does n't like it , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international orientation  --  a son , who is with Pan American Airways , and a daughter , who is in the Peace Corps . At the start of the Second World INTar , their father was invited to rejoin the Army , as a major , and to organize a school of Military Government . Where should it he His wife proposed Charlottesville. thereupon got the president of his university to offer facilities and then drafted a letter , for the general in charge of Military Government , accepting them . During the war , he rose to the rank of colonel and directed the training of Military Government officers in England and China . He received the Bron7c Star and was twice awarded the Legion of Merit , After V-J Day , he accepted the civilian post of Director of Studies at the National War College , in Washington . As soon as Dillard was appointed to the World Court , he began honing up on its cases , many of which have involved complicated international treaties . He thinks it has a useful role to play in international affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . It reduces international fevers . " At Charlottesville , he conducted a seminar on legal philosophy , and last fall he had each of a dozen students analyze a different World Court ease , to help him try to figure nut how the other judges think . His new job pays thine thousand dollars a year , and he is entitled to diplomatic immunity , but he does n't rate a private secretary . " It does seem a bit lonely after being around a university all these years , " lie said . " Still , I like The Hague . The Dutch are agreeably strong on tradition , including the hot ' with his finger in the dike , and the place is within comfortable striking distance of Amsterdam and Paris . " He is living at the Hotel Wittehrug , in a suite that has been occupied by eminent American jurists in an unbroken line dating back to Charles Evans Hughes , who served on the old Permanent Court of International Justice . As we were bidding Judge Dillard goodbye , he said , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a traffic ticket in Bangkok , the Cam  --  rouns , or Nigeria , just let me know and I 'll fix it for you . " Russia by Russians " T T S.S.R. PHOTO ' 70 " is a huge ? show of photographs of Rus-sia by Russians . Its opening , at the New York Cultural Center , on Columbus Circle , was the occasion for a party , which we attended . We decided to look at all the pictures before talking to any-body , and we liked what we saw . There were pictures of Russian churches and birch trees and the like , which looked very much like the pictures of Russian churches and birch trees taken by good Western photographers . There were also hundreds of pictures of RusSian people , who looked , for a change , like people . They were not miserably waiting in line for inadequate consumer goods . They were not grimly overfulfilling their quotas . They were n't doing anything in particular , except living . Later on , we looked around for some people to talk to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar that was dispensing shots of Stolichnaya , a splendid Russian vodka . We talked first with Leslie Lewis , who is the president of Ivel Corporation , an outfit that arranges exhibits . Mr. Lewis told us he was impressed by " U.S.S.R. Photo , 711 . " " It 's a very professional piece- of work , " Mr. Lewis told us . " I 've worked with a lot of different foreign groups on exhibits , and the Russians are , frankly , the most like Americans of any people I 've worked with . They have a sense of inimor under stress , and , believe mu , that 's important in this business , where the tension is tremendous . There 's always something missing , even in a small show , and this one has seventy-one tons of material . Why , they 're the singingest , piano-playingest , joke-tellingest people I 've ever met . " We then introduced ourself to Donald Karshan , the director of the Center , and Yevgeny Ruzhnikov , the deputy director of the exhibit , who were chatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind " U.S.S.R. Photo ' 70 " was the finest collection of photographs since " The Family of Man . " " I think of this as a pioneering effort in the use of photography to educate people about people , " Mr. Karshan said . Mr. Ruzhnikov said , " Thank y Thank you for calling us pioneers . Good photographs are taken ht- people who look , who walk into life . " A r cheolo gist IRts CORNELIA LOVE , who recently announced her discovery of the great circular Temple of Aphrodite in Cnidus , first visited that Turkish seaport , originally Greek , in August , 1966 , in the company of Aakidil Akarca , granddaughter of the last Sultan of Turkel. and a fellow classical archeologist , who is on the faculty of the University of Istanbul . " I was teaching at C. W. Post that year , " Miss Love told us the other day . " I had spent nine summers acting as a jack-of-all-trades at the excavation of the ruins at Samothrace , and I felt that the future of classical archeology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Cnidus , and I fell in love with the city . It had declined gradually during its Byzantine period , and had probably not been inhabited after the seventh century . Long Island University invited nit to join its faculty , and suggested that if found a promising archeological site it would try to get me hacking to explore it . In March , 1967 , two of the university trustees  --  William Zeckenthirf , Sr. and J r. ? introduced me to Jakob Ishrandtten , the shipping man . I talked to him for half an hour about Cnidus . I described its medical school , which antedates Hippocrates , and its astronomical observatory , but it was n't until got to its harbor ( two bar-hors , really a naval one , for triremes , and a commercial one ) that he seemed genuinely interested . The entire Spartan navy wintered there during the Peloponnesian War ; the Athenians sank it off Cnidus in 394 B.C. told Mr. Isb ra n t se n that the trireme harbor had silted up but could be drained and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition , and we got some more money from the Old Dominion Foundation , the Ingram-Merrill Foundation , and a couple of archeological huffs , Win Nathanson and David Fromkin , and a little from Mother . " Mother is Mrs. Cornelius Ruxton Love , Jr. , a daughter of the late Admiral Louis M. Josephtha ? a stockbroker who used to cruise around New York Harbor on a yacht  --  and a granddaughter of Isaac Guggenheim . " We started that summer with thirty-five workmen and a staff of seven , " Miss Love continued . " We grew larger in 1968 , and List summer we had a hundred workmen and a staff of twenty-one : one surveyor , one photogra-pher , two archeologists , five cataloguers , ten site supervisors , one assistant field director , and one director  --  me . I recruited them  --  Long Island University gives me autonomy  --  from the faculties of N.Y.U. , Columbia , Chicago , Oxford , Cambridge , Zurich , London , Istanbul , Jerusalem , and Tel Aviv ; two of them were Israelis who had worked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , when the ground gets soft , and in the fall , when it is n't so hot , but because of the academic schedule we start in June . All in all , we 've actually dug fur four and a half months . We 've uncovered or identified a magnificent , really spectacular Byzantine church and eight other Byzantine churches , a council house , three temples and an excellent candidate for a fourth one , a theatre seating forty-five hundred people , and a monumental Doric- portico , and we 've begun to excavate a port and an agora with another large Doric portico . Everything that is found he-longs to the Turkish government . " We asked Miss Love what being a director entails , and she said , " Raising the money ( we start from scratch for each new expedition ) , writing the reports for the Department of Turkish Antiquities , and seeing to it that the objects reach the museums it designates . I take roll call , do payday , see that the water supply is not cut off , buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to provide three decent meals a day . The native poultry and goats are too emaciated for eating ; I bring in canned hamburgers and hot dogs . There 's plenty of fish in the Aegean , but nobody has time to fish . We live in tents , which periodically blow down . The nearest village is ten kilometres away . I have a Land-Rover , and sometimes I pick up the food myself  --  okra , peppers , tomatoes , melons , eggplant , grapes , figs . We get some wild hoar , which is delicious barbecued . I make a wonderful sauce for it from oranges , plus marmalade . I buy all the equipment . The Turks arc delightful people to work with  --  very dignified , with great strength , and so polite ! You can say good night to a Turk for twenty minutes . The area in which we work is arable  --  tobacco , sesame , cotton , pistachios , almonds , figs , corn  --  and the women who do the tilling there are still subservient to men . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a project could be a woman . They get around this by calling me Miediir Bey , which means Mr. Director . " Mr. Director smiled a girlish smile , and we asked her how she got started in her career . Well , her father , a retired stockbroker , is a considerable collector of Chinese , Greco-Buddhist , and Napoleonic art , she said , and she was brought up in a house on Park Avenue that looked , and felt , a good deal like o museum . Metropolitan Museum curators abounded at cocktail parties . Her governess , who had originally been her mother 's governess and who stayed on until Iris went to college , used to regale her with tales of ancient history . " I would eat only if she told me stories of ancient kings and batt14. ! s , " she said . " Vegetables had to he given a historical background for me to choke them down . I was told that Brussels sprouts originated , as a dish , with Charlemagne , one of my great heroes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Brearley , and being taken to museums here and abroad . After Brearley , I went to Smith , and I felt that my destiny was classical art and archeology . I spent my junior year at the University of Florence . As a child , I was fascinated by the three great statues of the Etruscan warriors at the Met , but I was struck by the fact that in other museums I never saw anything that looked like them , other than tiny statuettes . " Back at Smith , she discussed this striking fact with her classics professor , who advised her to write her B.A. thesis on the warriors . FI , r paper showed that at least two of them were fakes . " I decided not to publish it at the time , " she said . " Gisela M. A. Richter , the Met 's curator of Greek and Roman Art , had written them up as masterpieces and had spent years defending them . Five years later , New York University , where I now lecture at the School of Continuing Educadon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fine Arts publication Marsyas : Studies ira the History of .471 , and I agreed . I altered the paper slightly to include the third warrior , which I now realized was also a fake . ' Three months before the publication date  --  February 15 , 1960 I spoke with James Rorimer , the director of the Met and an old friend of my family , and told him that I was going to publish the paper . I offered to let him have it for the Museum to publish . He did n't take me up on it . I called him up in February and said the paper was to he published a week later . He invited me to lunch in his office , on a Thursday . He asked me a lot of questions , and then called in Joseph V. Noble , a vice-director . Joe , did you know that the Etruscan warriors arc forgeries ? ' he said . I 've thought they were fakes for a year , ' Mr. Noble said . Mr. Rorimer called Mother up Sunday night and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Tuesday , the day before it was published , the Museum announced the forgeries in the Times , with no mention of me . I called up Rorimer , and he apologi7cd . He said he 'd treated me rather shabbily . I 've never forgotten that . I may nut have been the first to think that the statues were fake , but I was the first to write it . " Leo Lerman , in his recent MetTHE NEW YORKER sponsored " The Museum : Onc Hundred Years iind the Metropolitan Museum of Art , " has covered this episode by writing , " Noble is ... a forgery detector , and it was he who proved that the Museum 's three Etruscan terra-cotta warriors and the Greek horse were impostors . " We mentioned this to Miss Love , and she said , " A number of authorities fee that the horse may well be genuine . However that may he , I have some other Metropolitan Museum fakes up my sleeve . I once thought of sending word of one to Jim Rorimer every St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valentine 's Day Massacre . " We asked for a list , but she told us she 'd prefer to conclude the interview on a different note . " I have great hopes  --  if the Turkish government renews my permit  --  of finding Ptaxiteles ' marble statue of Aphrodite next summer , " she said . " Pliny considered it the finest statue in the world . There are fifty-two copies of it two in the Vatican . " We wished her luck . Rally ON March 12th , an organization called the Fund for New Priorities in America staged a rally in Madison Square Garden to raise money for senatorial candidates who want to end the war in Vietnam and do something about racial and environmental pi1b ! ems at home .. Most of the Fund 's sponsors had been active in the Presidential campaigns of Senators McCarthy and Kennedy two years ago , and all felt ( in the words of a Fund letter to prospective contributors ) that " the Spirit of ' 68 can not and must not die . " We went to the tally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we Found that while the Spirit of ' 68 is indeed still alive , it is coexisting , not altogether comfortably , with the Spirit of ' 70 . Before the rally , we stopped m at the Penn Plaza Club , under the mez zanine seats , for a bite of buffet supper with the participants in the rally . Alan Alda , the actor , who apparently did n't have anyone to sit with , either , joined us , and we asked him what he 'd been up to . " I 've been working on getting draft counselling  --  we call it ' Selective Service education ' ? into the high schools in my town , in Bergen County , " he said . " It 's very simple and very concrete , and it 's as legal as tax counselling . Sometimes I think the energy expended on rallies like this might better he used for something like that . People go to rallies and nothing happens , and they get frustrated . My God , people are already throwing bombs , and we have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need money for campaigns , but I do n't know  --  it 's not like the old days , when rallies seemed like fr . " Mr. Alda left to rehearse a skit with Jack Gil ford , and we took our seat in the Garden . The rally got under way only about forty minutes behind schedule , and the program  --  songs , skits , and speeches  --  was reminiscent of the McCarthy rallies of two years ago . The entertainment was entertaining , but not so much because of anything that was said or sung as because of the novelty of seeing people like Gwen Verdun , Jackie Mason , Henry and Peter Fonda , Tom Lehrer , Ruby Dee , Robert Ryan , Gene Wilder , Richard Benjamin , Paula Prentiss , and the Voices of East Harlem all in one room . I. F. Stone , the independent-minded journalist , read a speech he had typed up on the hacks of mimeographed rally programs . " If some of our children have been driven to the edge of lunacy , it is because the established order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Stone said . " Our program must be first to end the war , then to cut the military down to size , and then to restore an atmosphere in which rational discourse and the hope of peaceful change become possible again . To the cleansing of that atmosphere , we of the left most make our own contribution . Within our own ranks , the new cult of violence , the cultivation of hysteria , the suicidal impulses which mask themselves as ideological purity , the self-hatred which projects itself as hatred of our own country are poisons in the body politic , too -- sure ways to alienate the silent majority we must win .
