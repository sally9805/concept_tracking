Both TIME 'S Middle East Correspondent Wilton Wynn and Athens Reporter Dean Brelis were with the Syrian forces as they drove toward Beirut last week . Excerpts from their eyewitness accounts : <P> The town of Sofar , 45 minutes ' driving time from Beirut in the cool Lebanon mountains , has long been a favorite summer resort , both for wealthy Lebanese and Arabs from neighboring lands . It was there last week that the advancing Syrians met their first real resistance . On Tuesday , reports Wynn , the town was battle-scarred . Along the Beirut-Damascus highway , corrugated shutters of shop after shop were curled up from the shelling . Many of the cypress trees that once sheltered vacationing strollers had been smashed to splinters . Testimony to the Palestinian resistance was provided by three burned-out tanks that lay beside the road . <P> On the highway and on the hills flanking it was a massive concentration of tanks , transport , bulldozers , communications vehicles and Jeeps . Along the route I saw at least 200 tanks , and no doubt many more were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beirut , I walked to a point where a phalanx of tanks lined the rim of a hill , their guns pointing down to another resort town , Bhamdoun . A Syrian officer stood atop one of the tanks , and , as we talked , machine guns mounted on the next tank began blazing away . Leftist forces still held Bhamdoun , and the Syrians were shooting at any suspicious movements to keep them off balance . <P> The Syrians were digging in just short of Bhamdoun , waiting for reinforcements and fresh supplies . I asked a major about their next move . " In three days , " he boasted , " I will be able to drive you to Beirut . " <P> The drive to Beirut is normally a pleasant three-hour trip , but there was a lonely feeling the morning I left Damascus , cabled Brelis . Once beyond the city limits , I began running into military convoys , also headed for Beirut . First glance suggested rear-echelon troops ; then several big trucks appeared hauling empty trailers-the type that haul out crippled tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the trucks . There was no singing , but some of the solemn young draftees looked as if they were enjoying their work ; others seemed locked in thoughts about other places they would rather be . <P> In the cold mountain passes across the border , Syrian infantrymen were bundled up in winter-issue overcoats . As I drove nearer to Beirut , the army seemed to be everywhere . Several damaged tanks-three bearing scars of rocket hits-were on flat-bed trailer trucks heading back toward the border ; Red Crescent ambulances raced by with wounded in the back . Scores of Russian T-62 tanks and artillery were dug in on ridges . Every so often the troops would turn up their transistor radios , and the sounds of popular Arabic songs brought smiles to tough expressions . The litter of empty shell casings stacked neatly by buildings showed that , when there had been fighting , it had been fierce , quick , terrible . <P> At the Syrian front line-roughly twelve miles from Beirut 's sea front when I visited it-there were no preparations for an assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone ahead precisely on schedule .
