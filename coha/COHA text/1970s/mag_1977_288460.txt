PETE 'S DRAGON <P> Directed by Don Chaffey <P> Screenplay by Malcolm Marmorstein <P> He 's gorgeous , in a ghastly sort of way : the fine-featured , thoughtful face of a moose , though greener than your normal moose ; little scrambly front legs and big thumping back legs ; a great , green , swaying belly and a proper thrashing tail ; all supported by demure pink wings set too far forward for really good aerodynamics , so that he flies with a waddle . He fulminates fire , of course , if he has remembered to change his flint , and , all in all , it 's just as well that he is invisible most of the time . His name is Elliott . <P> Elliott has an active sense of humor , and thereby hangs a scaly tale , amiably told and only slightly overproduced by the Disney organization in time for the Christmas trade . There is an orphan boy , of course , played by a cute , smudge-cheeked red-haired kid named Sean Marshall . An urchin of this description appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that Disney grows them on its own Devils Island , using the cute ones for films and chaining the ugly ones to drafting tables to paint animated green dragons , frame by agonizing frame . <P> Anyway , Orphan Pete is so appealing that you want to strangle him , and several loathsome backwoodsmen and one awful backwoodslady ( Shelley Winters ) are trying to do just that as the action begins . They are the Gogans-really superior villains , who sing an enchanting song about wanting to tie Pete screaming to a railroad track . They have bought the lad for $50 , to provide boypower for their farm . He has escaped , and they are about to catch him , when-WHAPP ! - loyal Elliott swings his invisible green tail and lofts them gracefully into a mudhole <P> Off Pete and his useful friend go to the next town , which is Passamaquoddy Me . Strange things happen there . Lam-pie , the hard-drinking lighthouse keeper ( played rumbustiously by Mickey Rooney ) , tells everyone that he has seen a dragon . The pompous mayor ( Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clammy and invisible . A large unseen , clawed foot steps accidentally-on-purpose on the petticoat of a prissy and disapproving schoolmarm ( the time seems to be the 1890s , when there were long petticoats , lighthouse keepers and plenty of nasty villains , but since there is no mention of the Pullman strike or the free silver issue , it is hard to be sure ) . <P> Elliott 's clowning around gets Pete into a lot of trouble , and what 's more the Passamaquoddy fishermen say the dragon scares away the cod . When a snake-oil pitchman named Dr. Terminus ( Jim Dale ) and his sidekick ( Red Buttons , in good form ) want to grind Elliott into powder and make patent medicine of him , most of the townspeople think it s a good idea .
