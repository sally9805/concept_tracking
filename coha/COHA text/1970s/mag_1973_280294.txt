It is a sign of the times that the White House list of " enemies " contained not a single Communist , nor even the U.S. Communist Party . No one would have appreciated that irony more than Earl Russell Browder , 82 , general secretary of the party from 1930 to 1945 , who died in his sleep last week . <P> Browder 's life was replete with such ironies .

He spent the last quarter-century of his life in bittersweet retirement , first with his Russian-born wife Raissa in Yonkers , N.Y. , and , after her death , with one of his three sons ( all are professors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his corncob pipe and games of chess , he had plenty of time to field queries from inquiring historians .
