South Viet Nam 's onetime leaders reflect on their defeat <P> Viet Nam wo n't go away . The war rages on in an extravaganza of movies ( The Deer Hunter ) , in novels and memoirs ( Dispatches ) , and now in the headlines about Viet Nam 's attack on neighboring Cambodia . Until recently , however , there was a major gap in all the public recollections : there was no systematic analysis by senior leaders of South Viet Nam of their country 's sudden and crushing defeat in 1975 . <P> Last week that gap was filled . In an impressively restrained but at times moving report entitled The Fall of South Vietnam , published by the Rand Corp. , 27 high-ranking former military officers and government officials who managed to escape from Saigon set forth their candid views on the disaster . The 131-page report was compiled and written by three senior Rand staffers , Stephen T. Hosmer , Konrad Kellen and Brian M. Jenkins , who hoped to fill out the record " before memories dimmed and mythology set in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Ambassador to the U.S. Bui Diem to 13 generals . One who refused to participate : former President Nguyen Van Thieu , who now lives quietly in a London suburb . <P> Thieu was wise to stay away . More than any other person , he emerges as the major scapegoat , a latter-day Marie Antoinette , water-skiing and playing tennis as Hanoi 's legions stormed toward Saigon . Instead of providing leadership , the report says , he was " so vague that on many occasions long meetings were held by the ministerial council just for the purpose of interpreting what Thieu might have meant . " Though the mistrustful Thieu lived in constant fear of a U.S.-sponsored coup against him and , during the final weeks , changed bedrooms every night , he apparently also believed unwaveringly that the U.S. would somehow rescue Viet Nam at the eleventh hour . <P> Thieu is especially blamed for the sudden and disastrous decision in mid-March 1975 to abandon the strategic cities of Kontum and Pleiku in the Central Highlands , a move that brought on a rout described by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal operations in the annals of military history . " Only 20,000 of the 60,000 troops who had set out on Route 7B from Pleiku made it to the coast , and only 100,000 of the 400,000 civilians . Exhaustion , desertion , capture and death accounted for the rest . <P> While criticizing Thieu , however , the South Vietnamese officials do not spare themselves . They frankly admit the marsh of corruption surrounding Saigon : the concubines supported by misappropriated funds , the " ghost soldiers " whose paychecks were pocketed by the senior officers . When oil was discovered off the Vietnamese coast , Thieu 's first reaction was to talk of increasing an order of limousines for state visitors from two to ten .
