txt Truth has to change hands only a few times to become fiction , which is what makes the current baseball players ' strike so difficult to evaluate . Who do you believe ? Here you have two men , Marvin Miller and John Gaherin , arguing in a sound-proof closet , while nobody outside of baseball really knows what is going on . Mr. Miller represents the players and Mr. Gaherin the owners . The issue , if you can believe the bold print , is a very simple one . The players want an increase in what is already a very lucrative pension plan , and the owners do n't want to give it to them . This prompts two questions : 1 . Are the players asking too much ? 2 . Can the owners , who are already operating under spiraling labor costs , afford to dump roughly $4.5 million into making the players more comfortable ? Four-year requirement Since nobody is about to open his books to the public , who can really tell ?

According to The Sporting News , the baseball weekly out of St. Louis , players ' salaries currently range from $13,500 to $160,000 ? with the average leveling off at $28,500 . If this were a truck strike or a picket line made up of coal miners or garbage men , the entire nation would be in trouble . But the world does n't even hesitate , let alone stop , when a ground ball skips off the second baseman 's glove into right field or Frank Howard takes all the air out of the , park with one of his mighty swings . Baseball is associated with fresh air , hot dogs , soda pop , and kids with freckles . But it is about as necessary to the U.S. economy as the mod Yo-Yo which glows in the dark .

Nobody in government is about to invoke the Taft-Hartley Law or call for all-night sessions at the White House .

Remember , the banker gets paid , no matter what ! Meanwhile , Mr. Miller says the amount of money he would like the owners to put into the players ' pension fund ( $850,000 ) is not really the decisive question . To him , the issue is how the money should be applied . Interest estimated Several months ago me Owners Mica cu the players an increase a $490.000 over last year , which Mr. Miller advised against .
