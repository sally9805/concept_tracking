THEY 'RE PLAYING OUR SONG Book by Neil Simon Music by Marvin Hamlisch Lyrics by Carole Bayer Sager <P> Broadway 's paladin of laughter is back . It almost seems like an act of chivalry for Neil Simon to bestow his tonic comic gifts on a season as arid as this one has been . Of course , he has able assistance in this musical that , according to a program note , is " loosely based on the real-life relationship between the show 's composer Marvin Hamlisch and its lyricist Carole Bayer Sager . " Perhaps that is why the sharp crackle of humor in They ' re Playing Our Song seems to emanate from a warming log fire of shared humanity . <P> Although Simon rarely deals with young people or with bright show-biz professionals , his tart and wacky one-liners are in perfect accord with the temperaments of his hero and heroine . The show is very New Yorky in mood , with an opening backdrop of the Manhattan skyline that is like a bas-relief of tinseled Christmas trees . A top-name pop composer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his luxury apartment where he first meets Sonia Walsk ( Lucie Arnaz ) , an aspiring lyricist much in awe of his success . When she picks up his solid-gold Oscar , she is astonished : " They 're lighter than I thought ! " Quips Vernon : " They 're chocolate inside . " <P> Sonia and Vernon fall in love , or are finessed into it by Simon 's engagingly backhanded ploys . They collaborate blissfully , move in together and then face a period of maladjustment . Away from his piano , Vernon is a bundle of neuroses and almost inarticulate about his deepest feelings . Candid beyond discretion , Sonia seems to be carrying a guttering torch for a phone nemesis named Leon who calls at all hours , preferably 3 a.m . After some murky psychologizing about the schizophrenic difficulties of living and working together , the pair split and , copybook fashion , kiss and make up . <P> This becomes believable because the personalities of Klein and Arnaz are so appealing that you root for them . Klein has a flair for light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage like a pirate sweeping a deck . Arnaz matches his strength , and she sings her lyrics in-depth with Streisand 's gift for matching feeling with meaning . She hurdles the barricade of being the daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz by imitating neither , but she has inherited their incomparable comic timing . <P> On a report card , Hamlisch 's music and Sager 's lyrics score no higher than Bs , but they possess a finger-snapping vitality that turns explosive in the title number . A well-earned A goes to Douglas W. Schmidt 's stunningly sophisticated sets , Tharon Musser 's evocative lighting and Ann Roth 's clever costumes . Great joy has come to Shubert Alley .
