txt Baku , U.S.S.R. Azerbaijan , a land of arid hills , oil aerricks , and swarthy people , is frantically trying to clean house . Economic mismanagement , private racketeering , and corruption led last year to a change in the party leadership of this tiny republic in the Soviet Transcaucasus . Now , a year later , the purge continues . Last week two more top leaders of the Azerbaijan party apparatus were ousted . Another high functionary was expelled from the party for " dishonesty , insincerity , and deceit of the party . " Recently several regional party leaders were dismissed for building resplendent private villas at state expense . Many officials have been tried and jailed for bribery . Countless others have been warned . High officials are reluctant to spell out the magnitude of the problem but they admit its existence and their concern . Azerbaijani First Deputy Premier Islam Ali ogly Ibragimov , himself a new appointee , told this correspondent : " We are not afraid to expose our shortcomings in order to root them out . Bribery and private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we have uncovered them and taken measures against them . " Targets not reached Behind the sweeping war on corruption clearly lies Moscow 's determination to breathe new life into the lagging economy of the region , which last year failed to meet its plan . Once the world 's largest producer of oil , Azerbaijan has been overtaken by other oil-bearing regions and now is in the throes of shifting the weight of its economy to other industries ? chemicals , textiles , machine building , metallurgy . Hence the need for more efficient and conscientious management . Apparently the anticorruption crackdown and leadership upheaval are beginning to bear fruit . Deputy Premier Ibragimov said that the economic plan for the first half of the year was fulfilled and that " things are going very well now . " Industrial output rose 10 percent above the same period last year , he added , labor productivity was up 8 percent , and farms overall met their targets . Close observers of the Azerbaijani scene believe the battle is far from won , however , and that persisting pressure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Problems reflected This sprawling industrial capital itself reflects some of the problems which beset Communist planners . Much has been done to modernize and beautify the city , where every tree must be carefully coaxed from the thirsty soil . But the town has the air of a vast , neglected construction site , as if it has taken too much upon itself . Many roads are torn up , with no one tending to them . Hotels which should have been completed by now are still under construction . Modern new apartment houses stand empty . // *Azerbaijan crackdown // One local resident , an Azerbaijani , complains that the Mayor is more interested in his pet project of building a kilometer-long roadway into the Caspian Sea with a restaurant at the end than in moving city dwellers into new housing . The visitor quickly gathers that there is plenty of activity but that it is often diverted to private ends . " Everyone is making something on the side , " remarked an Armenian factory worker . " With money you can do anything ? get a vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not easy to live honestly . " Examples of flagrant corruption are not hard to come by . A recently published decree detailing manipulations in the district of Lenkoran , for instance , cited the case of a collective farm brigade that paid out more than 900 rubles ( about $1,000 ) to each farmer for only one day 's harvesting and loading of tomatoes . Resident Russians , who comprise a large 33 percent of the city 's population of 1.2 million tend to blame this state of affairs on the capitalist instincts of the Turkic-speaking Azerbaijanis , who have a flair for commerce . " Fifty years of Soviet rule has not altogether changed their mentality , " com- mented one Russian who has lived here 25 years . " The Azerbaijanis themselves say if the Russians were n't around they would n't do anything . Just trade and make money . " Meanwhile , the anticorruption campaign is even reaching down to the grassroots level . On a sidewalk off one central square stands a bulletin board on which are posted about 20 photographs of hapless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ticket . Most are charged with using their official position to get away with a free ride . Around the display stands a crowd of silent , engrossed onlookers.
