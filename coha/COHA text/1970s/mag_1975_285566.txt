For years Valery Panov was the premier dancer in Russia . His wife Galina was a ballerina of exhilarating potential . Then , in March of 1972 , Panov , who is a Jew , and Galina , who is not , applied for permission to emigrate to Israel . Refusal was accompanied by stunning repercussions : Panov 's dismissal from Leningrad 's Kirov Ballet , his wife 's ignominious demotion , and subsequent denial of the couple 's right to dance at all . <P> Life became a minute-by-minute ordeal of persecution , torture and imprisonment that stirred world indignation . In the many months that followed , the Panovs emerged as a symbol of oppressed Soviet Jewry . Last summer , finally allowed to enter Israel , they began the delicate process of recovering their art . <P> Last week in Philadelphia , the Panovs presented their visiting card to the Western Hemisphere . Dance buffs looked forward to the couple 's debut with foreboding as well as anticipation . Two years ' enforced idleness could have seriously impaired 25-year-old Galina 's abilities . For Valery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The big question was : Can the Panovs still dance well ? The answer was a resounding yes . <P> They got off to a shaky start . <P> As an arena for hockey games and rock concerts , Philadelphia 's 19,500-seat Spectrum is attractive and ample . As a setting for a ballet performance , it provided a frenzy of flashing lights , hissing loudspeakers and cloudbursts of balloons that resembled nothing quite so much as Busby Berkeley 's lampoon of a dancer 's nightmare . <P> At one end of the auditorium , the Panovs performed on a small , bare platform . The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra played on a raised stage behind them , causing Conductor Robert Zeller to cast uneasy glances across his shoulder to check music-dance synchronization . Temporarily blinded by a megawatt supertrooper rock-show spotlight , Galina lost sight of her husband and missed a lift during the grand pas de deux from The Nutcracker . " ' Where are you , Valery ? ' I cried to myself , " she said later . However , in The Lady and the Hooligan , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic aerial twists and one-knee landings were expressed in sharp balletic syntax . <P> Their dancing continued to gain in strength and grace . By the time they arrived at the showy display of Riccardo Drigo 's Harlequinade , Panov 's springy jet and Galina 's whirlwind fouettes ( whipping one-leg turns ) were evidence enough that for them the two years had been stopped time , not lost time . <P> Right now Galina is overshadowed by her husband 's mature artistry . It was Panov the dancing actor rather than Panov the spectacular technician who stole the evening . As Petrouchka in Stravinsky 's tragicomedy celebrating the Russian Punch , Panov combined Chaplinesque humor with a mime 's mastery of the mysterious language of silence . A floppy puppet holding his heart and crying real tears , Panov shrugged his shoulders and , with a spineless collapse , fell to the floor in a human puddle . In that single movement he captured all the joy and anguish of the universal clown . <P> <P> Joan Downs             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
