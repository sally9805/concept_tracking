After half a century of war , after the Holocaust and ' the spread of terror as a means of government , there is increasingly among us a kind of writer for whom life and art can not be held separate , neither in conduct nor in judgment , and not for reasons narrowly personal but because in situations'directly political , existence and expression become conditions of each other . Solzhenitsyn is an example . But so too , in his quieter way , is Czeslaw Milosz , the Polish poet and man of letters who since 1951 has lived in the United States , and who has just received the 1978 Neustadt International Prize for Literature . In exile from a world which no longer exists ( he was born in Lithuania in 1911 ) , a Witness to the Nazi devastation of Poland and the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe , Milosz deals in his poetry , with the central issues of our impact time  --  the mpact of history upon moral being , the search for ways to survive spiritual ruin in a ruined world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1973 , is foremost a poetry of loss and aftermath . The new yolume , , Bells in Winter , gives us a poetry of recovery . Milosz 's work as a whole , that is to say , shows a development splendid in itself and crucial to us all . But what needs remarking first is simply the effect , for American readers , of Milosz 's kind of poetry . In his " Ars Poetica ? , " for example , the question mark in the title alerts us to the poem 's theme : that although no aesthetic principle is absolute or safe from abuse , some notions of poetic practice are better , more responsible , less dangerous , than others , especially in times as mad and unholy as ours . The poet should be careful of his power , which is greater than himself . Art should serve more than itself , and in an age of wreckage , with nations dispersed and loyalties divided , " The purpose of poetry is to-remind us / how difficult it is to remain just one person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Survivor : An Anatomy of Life in the Death Camps ( Oxford University Press ) . Milosz thus abjures modernism and pledges himself to values of " a time when only wise books were read / helping us to bear our pain and misery . " Such serious and demanding claims , for those schooled on modern poetry in , America , will sound old-fashioned and out of literary place , especially when measured against our own ' Ars Poetica , " which praises poems " dumb " and " silent , " and advocates the idea that " A poem should not mean / But be . " Be- ' tween poetry and life no commerce is expected , a ? rule recently amplified by a ! famous scholar-critic who declares that " the meaning of a poem can only be another poem , " and that " solipsism " is chief among poetic virtues . By solipsism is meant the poet 's resistance to everything outside the self  --  events , other selves , life as we live it  --  all of which counts for no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulas are more representative than They at first appear . In the main , American poetry does ignore history ; and even for a poet as obsessed with events as : Robert Lowell , the world 's agony is but mirror and emblem of his own internal torment . From Emerson and Dickinson onward , American poetry celebrates perception for perception 's sake , it focuses on the interior drama of wholly isolated selfhood , it posits destiny in solely individual terms . For a poet like Milosz , who saw Warsaw leveled and was among the handful to survive his generation 's murder , such attitudes must not only sound out of place but out of the world altogether . People , places , things , everything for Milosz is densely historical , and destiny is shared , it is human destiny . The value of experience depends on connection , or failure of connection , with others ; and our humanity remains tragically tied to the inhumanity we resist or , when overcome , simply endure . Memories of atrocity and betrayal forever haunt his poetry , a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captive Mind , he calls " the vision of the cobblestones " : A man is lying under machine-gun fire on'a street in an embattled city . He looks at the pavement and sees ' a very amusing sight . the cobblestones are standing upright like the quills of a porcupine The bullets hitting against their edges displace and tilt them . Such moments in the consciousness of a man judge all poets and philosophers . ' In this way , at least , Milosz would jUdge his own work . Death in itself is not the measure but ' rather the manipulation of death for dehumanizing purposes and what this does to human beings , as when those bullets , those machine-guns spraying random streets , make men and women crawl . At such moments , the innocence with which poetry would , . celebrate the world is lost , the - poet is stopped by ugliness too fierce for song to bear : The first movement is singing , ; A free voice , filling mountains and valleys . The first movement is joy , But it is taken away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know of no poet more driven to celebration , to sing of the earth in its plainness and glory , and therefore no poet more tormented ( " We , whose cunning is not unlike despair " ) by the terrible detour through history which must be taken if , in pursuit of joyous song , the authority of poetic affirmation is not to remain untested or open to the charge ' of ignorance . But after witnessing the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto , / after the Soviet betrayal of the Polish uprising , after the protracted Misery of the Baltic resettlement , the will to praise life meets hard objections . What is left to nourish and uphold ? Where is joy to take root ? Above all , as Milosz repeatedly says in the Selected Poems , how can we live with ourselves after the awful revelations of our own time : We learned so much , this you know well : how , gradually , what could not be taken away is taken . People , countrysides . And the heart does not die when one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bread on the table . The pain of memory is compounded by the anguish of self-revelation , as if one 's failure to embrace " the poor ashes of Sachsenhausen / with absolute love " were a terminal diminishment , a deformation of spirit severe enough to cancel our right to praise , our right to find life good . The burden of aftermath , for those who must bear it , would seem to be final . 742 And yet it is not . " You could scream / Because mankind is mad . / But you , of-all people , should not . " Thus the poet 's responsibility is defined in Bells in Winter : to behold " not out of sorrow , but in wonder . " In a short poem called " Proof , " Milosz writes : " You remember , therefore you have no doubt : there is a Hell for certain . " But in a companion poem called " Amazement , " he finds that the wholeness of the world is greater than its horror , that everything , not excluding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cranes , " goes on simultaneously and , as he ' concludes , that earth 's plenitude is " probably eternal . " The truth of a truism is thus revived by earning it anew , a procedure typical of Milosz , as is his use of " probably " : hope is real but abridged , faith remains open to question . , On first reading , many of the shorter poems in Bells in Winter seem slight . But let us not misread : these are poems of settlement , of provisional detente with the past , and As such they , are poems rooted in history , in a context of atrocity from which  --  if only for the poem 's duration  --  they manage to pull free . A deceptively simple poem entitled " An Hour ' - " serves both as illustration and as comment : Leaves glowing in the sun , Lealous hum of bumble bees , From afar , from somewhere beyond the river , echoes of lingering i ' voices - - And the unhurried sounds of a hammer gave joy not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and earlier than any beginning , They waited , ready , for all those who would call themselves mortals , 1 So that they might praise , as I do , life , that is , happiness What memory , itself afar , lingering , unhurried , do the first three lines pre- , serve ? With whom  --  a lover , a land , all of lis  --  is joy shared ? Memories , the senses , life 's endless small splendors  --  who is " T , ... , y " ? This is surely more than exercise in pastoral . To equate life with happiness an , d mean tt is an astonishing victory in our brute century . To recover rapport with existence " earlier , than any The Nation . beginning " is to regain that which was taken away : the first movement , joy . And the title , I think , can not be read as irony These mometits come , seldom and do not last , yet without them ( we are indeed lost . Slight as it appears , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world such as ours . And it argues something else also , a principle central to the kind of poetry Milosz writes ? to grasp this art in its fullness , it can not be separated from the world , it can not be detached from the circumstance of its birth In the case of poets like Milosz , literary f'ilfillment depends , on extra " literary consciousness , on knowing the historical situation to ' Which the poem implicitly responds , which is a kind of awareness the poem then incorporates back into itself . This is not a case of the famous " hermeneutic circle , " wherein poems grow in meaning by virtue of the interpretations they can be made to bear . Rather , we are dealing with on-. gins and context , a case of knowing where the poem came from , out of what wreckage , defeat , aftermath . This way of reading poems is not congenial to Americans but it is indispensable to much of the best poetry now coming out of other traditions , South American and Eastern European in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , " From the Rising of the Sun , " is also Milosz 's most anbitious andi perhaps his greatest work . It fills nearly half the pages of Bells of Winter , and as a poem not only about its own becoming but of Milosz 's development as a whole , ' it takes for the title of its culminating section the title of the book itself Replete with historical detail , this is nevertheless the most personal poem Milosz has written . It is nothing less than the poet 's attempt to pull together the fragmen6 of his abnormally scattered life , to see'himself whole , from his childhood in Lithuania , through his years as witness and exile , up to the present time  --  from a journey begun " one acrid morning , looking through the fences at gardens/And courtyards , where a black dog , barks , and someone December 30 , 1978 chops wood , " to that journey 's unlikely , destination . In the morning we were cutting logs with a chain saw And it is a strong , fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combustion . , Below , the bay , the playful sun , And the towers of San Francisco seen through rusty fog Descriptions of cities , events , and persons central to his life are juxtaposed with meditations Upon the historical significance of his experience , its representative character , its possible value within a realm transcendent and timeless . More than a little , this vast undertaking resembles T.S . Eliot 's " Four Quartets , " but with one crucial difference : where Eliot saw the world in terms of his own spiritual predicament , Milosz sees his life in terms of the world  --  a reversal which in his autobiographical book , Nati re Realm , he sums up this way : " Instead of thrusting the individual into the foreground , one can focus attention on the background , looking upon oneself as a sociological phenomenon . Inner experience , as it is preserved in the memory , will then be evaluated in the perspective of the , changes one 's milieu has undergone . " I And yet the aim of both Milosz and Eliot is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one 's own time on earth , to gather up the worst along with the best , integrate past and present into a culminating moment which transcends both , which embraces pain and joy together , the whole of a life and , a world redeemed through memory and art , a final restoration in spirit of that which-in historical fact has been forever lost . And when Milosz says , in the poem 's last line , " I was judged for my despair because I was unable to understand this , " we see hoW very far he has come . More than any modern poet I know ( and admitting that plenty of poets handle language with more precious craft ) , Milosz has earned , - through his work , a solution to the most pressing spiritual dilemma today : how to bear the burden of historical consciousness without despair . Morally , we must say No to life as ' it IS , because , terror and injustice are everywhere apparent and no one is immune or exempt . But just as much , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , because we can not live without some affirmation of our own existence . From the perspective of political responsibility , morality and mysticism clash fatally , or so I thought until I began to see what Milosz was struggling toward and what he has at last made good . The air is thick with horror and no one remains untouched . The air is thick December 30 , 1978 with horror and some part of the soul must stay ipviolate or the core of human worth wilLperish . These two positions are mediaQd , through the kind of poetry Milosz gives us , which I would now call " political ? " ik " the extended sense just described , ' to distinguish it from the kind of poetry which proceeds , after Auschwitz , after Hiroshima , as if between the world-in-the-self and the selfin-the-world /there were no tie or common ground . I began by contrasting Milosz 's example with the ? Emersonian tradition in American poetiy . The point is that Milosz is not alone in the kind of poetry he writes , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply by the pressure of their example , the dominion of American standards . The Polish poets - Thigniew Herbert and Tadeusz Rozewicz are as powerful as Milosz : Elsewhere from the East , poets like Anna Akhmatova , Nazim Vasko Popa and Yannis Ritsos ( respectively Russian , Turkish , Yugoslav , " Greek ) have produced work impossible to ignore . The same may be said of South American poets , Pablo Neruda , Nicaner Parra and Cesar Vallejo to name only , a , few . And on the whole , the humanity of this kind of poetry is enhanced ( rather than weakened , as is usually argued ) by its fund of historical sense . Rooted in direct response to political pressure , : , which is to say in despair and resistance , in ruin and recovery , this kind oyikerature yields a new aesthetics , principles which in Milosz 's case I have described as a poetics of aftermath . And apart from the inherent grandeur of the achievement itself , what most excites me its its possible influence upon the narrowing relevance ? Rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are among the exceptions  --  of poetry written in America now . This is less the coming of a crisis than arrival at a crossroads . For the first time in our literary history ( the French connection does not count because it was imported ) , , poetic practices governed by the forces of a single strong tradition have begun to clash with an exceedingly rich confluence of other traditions , a col-lision energized by the accelerating im-pact of history , the intense brutality of daily events , upon consciousness itself . I am not saying that we must take up arms and join the underground as Mi-losz did , or like him that we must endure the plunder a , nd dispersal of our nation , suffer exile and historical shame , before a poetry worth writing can emerge . The point is not direct participation but the confrontation , assessment , and assimi-lation of events in their aftermath , in their ? 4mprint upon reality , in their de-monic persuasiveness  --  which is simply a matter of knowing , of our rapidly inThe Nation . creasing and ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial to no people in its blind delivery of consequence , is bars . We know too much , we are assaulted daily by information about too many events at large . As Wordsworth said , himself in desperate grips with aftermath , the world is too much with us . Until recently , the domain of self , the egotistical sublime , has taken primacy over external events in American consciousness . But that was the happy accident of our own historical origins on a virgin continent which cost no more than minor ( by world standards ) genocide , and which , until the age : of the rocket , world markets and oil , was pro- , tected in its chastity by poor communications and pure distance . The war in Asia broke our claim to innocence , and our cherished myths pf the New Adam and Worlds Elsewhere have fallen into fast decay . History is the self 's other half , its boundary and nemesis , a foundation fearful , unstable yet essential , without which the poet sings thinly and can not claim the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art which . is our first vehicle of human communion . If American poetry does indeed stand at this crossroads , then some revision 743 seems imminent : no longer the word over the world , nor the world over the word either , but a union of the two not to be got without risk , but surely worth attempting . The virtue of Czeslaw Milosz , quite apart from his worldly intelligence , his will to stay sane amid madness , his modest steady voice  --  apart from these his virtue resides in his example .
