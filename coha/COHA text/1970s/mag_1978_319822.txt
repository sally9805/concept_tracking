When nine inches of rain pounded New Orleans in one day early last month , the downpour left behind containers and pools of stagnating water that were perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes . That was a bonus for the U.S. Department of Agriculture , which had already picked New Orleans as the site for the first extensive test of mosquito control not by chemical or hormonal means but by another kind of mosquito . <P> The predator mosquito that has raised the hopes of USDA scientists is a creature with the formidable name of Toxorhynchites rutilus rutilus . During its larval stage in stagnant water , the mosquito feeds on the larvae of more common , biting and disease-carrying cousins , like the Aedes aegypti , which also breeds in pools and water-filled containers . Although the Tx. rutilus is found from Florida to Canada and as far west as Texas , it is not very prolific by insect standards and does not exist naturally in numbers large enough to control the population of other mosquitoes . That deficiency presents no problem to USDA Entomologist Dana Focks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fla. , laboratory . Says Focks : " Toxorhynchites are found everywhere and are feasible to use in mosquito control everywhere . But we need to know how many are required and how much it will cost . " <P> To find the answers , Focks will set up in New Orleans two 40-hectare ( 100-acre ) sites , one as a control and one for experimentation . During this summer , he will release in the test area about 1,000 female Toxorhynchites , which will lay eggs that hatch into predatory larvae . Because the New Orleans mosquito control board has kept records on the Aedes aegypti for four years , any significant decrease in its numbers will be apparent . " We know the Toxorhynchites will be effective , " declares Focks , " and the cost could be only pennies per acre . " <P> But what happens after Tx. rutilus does in large numbers of the prey mosquitoes ? Does it turn , in its adult stage , to bigger meals-like man ? Fortunately , the bug 's proboscis can not penetrate the skin of animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on flower nectar and plant detritus . Thus for mosquito control , as Focks puts it , " the Toxorhynchites is a neat package . "
