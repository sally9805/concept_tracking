In West Africa it is known as dash , in Latin America as la mordida ( the bite ) , in Italy la bustarella ( the little envelope ) . By whatever name , bribery and associated tactics-outright payoffs to clerks and customs inspectors , " contributions " to political parties , the hiring of government officials as " consultants " - have long been accepted in many countries as the normal , natural way to get any business done . U.S. companies operating overseas must somehow adjust to that atmosphere . But the biggest scandal in American business right now is that too many seem to have become a part of it . <P> Remarkable Record . In recent months headlines have been filled with charges of payoffs overseas-and some damaging admissions . United Brands has admitted paying a $1.25 million bribe in Honduras to get a banana export tax reduced , and Gulf Oil conceded making illegal contributions of $4 million to South Korea 's ruling political party . Last week the Senate Subcommittee on Multinational Corporations took up the most eye-opening case of all , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has a remarkable record of selling warplanes to foreign governments . Its tiny , efficient F-5 Freedom Fighter is flying in 17 countries ; Chairman and President Thomas V. Jones foresees a global market for 2,500 Cobra II fighters , priced at $4 million to $5 million each . <P> The subcommittee amassed a wealth of information about payments that Northrop made overseas . Much of the information came from a 530-page report prepared by Northrop 's auditors , Ernst &; Ernst , which started to investigate to comply with a consent decree that settled a Securities and Exchange Commission suit against Northrop . In their testimony , Jones and Executive Committee Chief Richard Millar sought to justify most of the payments as legitimate . In many cases they failed to convince skeptical Senators , who expect similar revelations from other companies . One danger is that in the public view , innocent multinationals will be clobbered along with the not so innocent . Said Idaho Democrat Frank Church , chairman of the subcommittee , to the Northrop executives : " Your case is to be regarded as representative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northrop since 1971 may have spent as much as $30 million overseas for which it did not properly account . Ernst &; Ernst described 17 arrangements as questionable enough to warrant study . Some seem legitimate , but others are open to grave objections . They range from the petty-$4,400 to an Iranian tax assessor to settle " a minor tax matter " - to the serious . Some examples : <P> <P> &gt; Northrop passed to Adnan Khashoggi , a wealthy Saudi Arabian entrepreneur , $450,000 designated for two Saudi Arabian generals , Hashim Hashim and Asad Zuhair , who served at different times as chief of the nation 's air force . Khashoggi denies the generals were bribed to buy Northrop planes . Nonetheless , Northrop did not defend the payment . Millar apologized last week to the Saudi government " for any embarrassment caused by this matter . "
