THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment N recent weeks , the war in Vietnam / has led the United States into a new relationship with the rest of the world . When the terror bombing of Hanoi began , world opinion  --  that amorphous institution made up of whatever voices have the strength and the freedom to make themselves heard  --  seemed , after several years of silence , to reconstitute itself for the occasion . Heads of friendly countries voiced their objection to our bombing and to our whole war policy . The Canadian House of Commons voted unanimously to condemn the bombing . The governments of France , Denmark , and Finland arranged to send funds for medical supplies . So did many private organizations , including the World Council of Churches . Throughout Western Europe , the most highly respected publications likened our actions to those of the Nazis . Boycotts against American ships were proposed in several countries , and one was carried out in Australia . Harold Wilson cancelled a lecture tour of the United States because of " strong feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but almost none offered approval or support . As might have been expected , it was in the democratic , not the totalitarian , countries that the deepest revulsion was expressed . There had been waves of protest before , but this was something of greater weight than protest . The world appeared to have reached that degree of near-unanimity of feeling which makes up a prevailing historical judgment that will stand for decades to come . It was as though the war had lasted so long that historical judgment was delivered on it even before it was over . This shift of opinion was the end , not the beginning , of a debate . Decent men all over the world had declared that our war policy had moved beyond argument . There were several reasons this particular escalation of the war had such a decisive effect . In the first place , it had once been possible for an onlooker to suppose that our government believed that in fighting Vietnamese it was actually fighting " Communism , " a force that included such large and credibly menacing powers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friendly visits to Russia and China it became inescapably plain just who our adversary really was : it was only little Vietnam . The true disproportion of the war stood revealed . And since we had nothing to fear and nothing to gain from such a tiny , remote power , even self-interest no longer served as an explanation of the war . Vietnam began to look like a forsaken land where a lunatic giant appears and , having shot up everyone in sight , shoots himself . Also , whereas we had undertaken other escalations in response to real or imagined moves by our adversary , this one we took unilaterally and without any military pretext . We went from the smiles and jokes of the peace talks to the bombing with perfect nonchalance , like one of those teams of torturers who alternate between ingratiating themselves with their victim and beating him up . Finally , since we no longer had large numbers of troops in the Smith , the excuse that we were " protecting our withdrawal " could not be advanced . In short , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration , seeming almost to acknowledge that the debate had ended , and that any justification it offered could only add to the offense , offered no arguments or justifications . The war was now being fought not only without reason but without rationalization . In these circumstances , the world saw the bombing for exactly what it was . It was murder  --  murder with " no corn menu " But just at the moment when the world was finding its voice and uniting to express its horror at the war , the United States seemed to be slipping into a world of its own . In the past , if some Americans had been the world 's preeminent warmakers , other Americans had been the world 's preeminent protesters against the war . But at the moment when the world was awakening , the American people as a whole , who are supposedly in the driver 's seat of the machine that is crushing Vietnam , were nodding at the wheel . Then , as the Ninety-third Congress got tinder way , there came some stirrings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of decision  --  to be poised between a national life of full-time wakefulness and a national life of full-time somnolence . From the start , our war in Indo-China  --  even as it took millions of us to a land thousands of miles away , - has tended to cut us off from the world . It sent us running all over the world but held us paralyzed in isolation . It held us in a world of our own hal-lucinatory obsessions , which has now swollen to the point of blot-ting out the real world alto-gether . And the real world , for its part , watches in dis-may as the United States , which has only to look up for a moment to find , and to re-join , a world of eased ten-sions , returns with obsessive fury to hacking away at the bloody mess at its feet which is Vietnatil . We went to Vietnam to save the Vietnam-ese , but the Vietnamese we were sav-ing were imaginary . The real Viet-namese wanted us to leave them alone . Now we arc out to save the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " generation of peace . " This time our beneficiaries are the peoples of the entire world , and once again our beneficiaries do n't want out help . Our characteristic vice in the war years has been not so much to defy the world as to deny it , not to see it at all . Now when the Swedish government protests our actions we tell it not to send us its new ambassador . We put him , and his country , out of our ? ? sight . In the long run , a nation that encloses itself in a shroud of secrets and lies can not stand free intercourse with the walk ' . We started by blotting out the truth about our actions in the world , although some of our own people tried to get the message through . ( The trial of Daniel Ellsberg started last week . ) Now the entire world is trying to tell us the truth about ourselves , and it 's the world 's turn to he blotted nut . We ca n't make other people close their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear by firmly shutting our own eyes . A recent event at the Pentagon suggests how things can be blotted out . Mr. Jerry Friedheim , the Pentagon spokesman who had been saddled with the job of explaining the bombing to the nation , was asked about the reports that American bombs had hit the hospital of Bach Mai , in Hanoi . Elk " refused to confirm the report , and went as far as to question even the existence of the hospital . He said , " I do n't know what the other side ma ) refer to as the Bach Mai Hospital , if indeed there is one . " And he was right , of course . There vas no Bach Mai Hospital Two Gatherings THERE has been word of a black rock opera , the first black rock opera , and some days ago a lot of music-business people gathered in the Corinthian Room of the New York Sheraton Hotel to celebrate the news . The rock opera in question is called " nee the Black Man 's Chains ; " it is meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their chains , and it has n't really arrived yet , What has arrived is a record album called " Free the Black Man 's Chains , " by a group called the Afro-American Ensemble , and a promise that the loosely plotted songs in this album may one day be used in a rock opera . But the- promise of the possible arrival of the first black rock opera is cause enough for celebration , after all , so the gathering in the Corinthian Room was lively . There was some slightly lofty talk about the implications of the black rock opera ; there was some franker talk about promoting the album ; and there was gossip . We talked with Len Sachs , who is the vice-president of GSF Records , the nearly new independent record company that has issued the album made by the Afro-American Ensemble . He is a vigorous middle-aged man , who that night was wearing a gray suit with a windowpane check . He was standing close to the door of the Corinthian Room , greeting people . He continuid to greet people while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totalle involved with the Afro-American Ensemble for quite some time , " he said " After an evaluation and some negotiation , I brought the album and the project to GSF . Sid ! " Mr. Sachs moved forward to greet Sid Parties , the editor-in-chief of Record World . " I 'm sn glad you arrived . I 'm so glad you came . I dig vou . You know that . " Mr. Sachs returned to our side . " GSF is still voung . We have Lloyd Price , you know . And Eddie Holman and Garnet Mimms . We 're a genuine independent record company . I would n't want to say that we 're a rhythm-and-blues label . We just happen to have a lot of black product . Oh , there 's Iry Lichtman , of Cash Box . My first thought for ' Free the Black Man 's Chains ' was to tour black colleges in a concert version . The concert will help the record to sell . " We talked with Richard Gersh , who is an important public-relations man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Corinthian Room , and he was relaxed and friendly and smi'ing . " We 're going to do it this way , " he said . " First , G. Fitz Bartley , who is with Soul magazine , will present a plaque to Lenny Sachs . I know all about that  --  I wrote the plaque . Then the group will sing a few of the songs from the album . I just saw a man from the William Morris office . They hooked ' Jesus Christ Superstar . ' " We talked briefly with Bernard Purdie , the drummer , who told us that GSF Records was now distributing his jazz label , Encounter Records , and then , as Mr. Gersh had predicted , G. Fitz Bartley , of Soul , presented a plaque to Mr. Sachs . The plaque was given , Mr. Bartley said , " in recognition and appreciation of the great cultural service you have performed in offering the public ' Free the Black Man 's Chains , ' the first black rock opera . " We talked with the Reverend Carlton Coleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once was a disc jockey for WWRL . Mr. Coleman said he thought that a black rock opera was a good idea , because it was easier to get a message across in music than in a sermon . Then we talked with Sid Parnes , who said he was leaving . Then the Afro-American Ensemble performed . The music was energetic . Afterward , we talked with L. C. Grier , who is the lead singer of the Ensemble . " The group 's been together for about six months , " he said , " but I 've been stumblin ' down the road for years . " LTER , we went to the premiZre of the movie " Across 1 1 0 th Street , " at Locws Victoria Theatre . Loews Victoria is on 125th Street , and everyone at the premiere was saying that it was the first time there had been a world movie premiere in Harlem . There were black limousines double-parked along the street when we arrived , and there was a crowd behind police barriers watching people go in . An elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a small space between the limousines and handed out printed bills hearing a quote from Charles Kenyatta . It read , " Black ' Exploitation ' Premier : I call upon the people of the Harlem Community to drive these undesireable criminal element vultures out . Do not support these Cadillac Pimps who 'll do anything to keep from working . Es this another rip-off ? " The people behind the harriers did not acknowledge any distance between themselves and the people going into the theatre . They shouted to the people going in , and flattered them and insulted them and graded them . A woman wearing a black velvet hooded cloak went into the theatre quickly , ignoring the crowd . " Hey , Cinderella , take off the hood and let me see who you are ! " a young man shouted after her . There was some excitement over a very good-looking young man in a white suit , white coat , and white hat . A young kid in a black leather jacket and a " Super Fly " hat was the first to spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the kid in the " Super Fly " hat said . " Who is he ? " a companion asked . " Good-looking , that 's all , " said the kid in the hat . The man in white frustrated the crowd by staying across the street , where it could n't get a good look at him . " Here ! Come over here ! " several people shouted . When he still did n't come , some of the crowd turned against him . " He 's not anybody  --  just an outfit , " said the kid in the " Super Fly " hat " Who does he think he is ? Super Fly ' on credit ? " another kid said . Raven Chanticleer , the fashion designer , arrived with a footman in a horse-drawn carriage and let everybody admire his costume The footman carried a bag that was full of press releases , and handed them out left and right . One of Mr. Chanticleer 's releases said , " Celebrated Fashion Designer , Raven Chanticleer , Arrived at the benefit Wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maxi brown mink cape and tote bag . " Inside the theatre , ushers tried to get people to sit down , but they did n't have any success . Instead , people stayed in the mirrored lobby of the Victoria , talking to each other . It was an hour before the people in the mirrored lobby went into the theatre . When the they heard some speeches about the movie , about Anthony Quinn and Yaphet Kotto , two of the stars of the movie , and about the beneficiary of the premiere , an organization called the Manhood Foundation , which tries to find jobs for e ? .1-convicts . Then Anthony Quinn spoke . He was very serious . He said that " Across 1 1 0 t h Street " was a violent film by design , because desperation is violence . Until desperation is eradicated , Anthony Quinn said , there will he violence . After Mr. Quinn finished , other people were introduced . We talked with the woman in front of us , who was Arai Love , and who said she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm the girl screaming on the balcony , " she said . " I 'm what you call a dress extra in this picture , which means I wear my own clothes . I had extra business , which means I had one shut where they held the camera on me . " After talking with Miss Love , we watched the movie , which was , as Mr. Quinn had said , quite violent , placing a new emphasis on machine-gun battles . Later in the evening , there was a party given for the Manhood Foundadon at Big Wilt Small 's Paradise . At Small 's , we talked with a man named Sonni Malik , who told us what he thought of the film . " I liked it for three reasons , " he said . " Reason Number One , the black woman was righteous . She brought her man his medicine and died with him . Number Two , he took care of his business and took care of some of the police . Number Three , he left his money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to the little black children . " New New New 1/VE have been an admirer of the Wankel engine ever since we first saw an article about it in a news magazine , illustrated with a diagram of its peanut-shaped rotor chamber and a breakdown of the stages of intake , compression , ignition , and exhaust . It was mind-expanding to try to imagine the three-sided rotor as it whirled eccentrically inside the chamber . The Wan-kid , or rotary , engine has three essential moving parts , compared to many times that number in a piston engine . It is simple and relatively lightweight , and it is said to he more easily adapted than a piston engine to the emission-control devices that cars will have to have if people are to keep on breathing . It may eventually replace the piston engine in most new automobiles . One rotary-engine car  --  the Mazda , made by Toyo Kogyo  --  is now on the market , and we went over the other day to the one dealer in town that sells this car : Mazda Wolf Manhattan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have probably seen a Mazda on the streets , but if you have n't , it does n't matter , because the Mazda looks like just about every other compact car that has ever been made . A man in our apartment building owns one , and when we asked him once how he liked it , he said , with a big grin , " It 's great ! It 's got more acceleration than you can use ! " But he is a fairly . immature person , if you ask us , and we did n't believe him . We wanted to take a test drive for ourself . So there we were in a shiny automobile showroom on East Sixtieth Street . We kicked a tire or two , opened and shut a few doors , tried out the front and back seats , and chatted with a polite young salesman by the name of Hans Gillner . The Mazda operates just like an ordinary car . The only unusual instruments on the dashboard are a manual choke , a tachometer , and a switch for extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an option , and it costs eleven dollars extra , but Mr. Gillner said every car comes with one  --  you ca n't opt out of the option . We did n't complain about this , because it was fun to zip the antenna up and down , like a jet of water . Mr. Gillner had a test car brought out onto the street for us -- a green two-door cou ? and he sat hack in the passenger 's seat with remarkable composure as we accelerated away from the curb , We began to think it might even be nice to own a rotary-engine. car . Scarcely a hundred feet of asphalt had passed beneath our wheels before we had to stop behind a truck waiting for the light at the corner of York Avenue . We turned right on York and managed to get our Mazda into second gear before we had to fall in line behind a string of cabs heading downtown . We turned right again on Fifty-fifth Street and eventually reached the corner of First Avenue , where we delicately steered around a Telephone Company manhole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uptown amidst a heterogeneous pack of traffic . Another right turn , at Sixtieth , and there we were again , in front of Mazda Wolf Manhattan . The ride was over . " Would you like to go around again , with me driving ? " Mr. Gillner asked . " You were shifting the gears as if this were an ordinary car as soon as it reached two or three thousand r.p.m . " We had to admit that it had hardly seemed different from any other peppy car we had ever driven , so we were quite willing to go around again , this time in the passenger 's seat . Mr. Gillner , driving , took exactly the same route , and ran into  --  or nearly ran into  --  manv of the same obstacles , except that he managed to hit four thousand r.p.m. as he zoomed hack up First Avenue . It must have been as our car crawled around the Telephone Company manhole project the second time that we began to feel a certain depression , which comes over us every now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syndrome  --  or , the " I 've Got Too Many Things ! " Bit . We felt like withdrawing a little . We returned to the showroom with Mr. Gainer , and we stood with him in front of a poster showing some stripped-down engines , and as he was explaining how many fewer moving parts the rotary engine has , we thanked him , bade him goodbye , and slipped away . Pride AROVING friend who enjoys both music and schnapps reports that he was in the foyer of SYmphony Hall in Boston the other evening , admiring the two bars that now adorn the place . He extended his congratulations to one of the barmen . " Thank you , sir , " replied the barman . " The community has accepted the additional bat most graciously . "
