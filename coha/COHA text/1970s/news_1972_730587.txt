txt A maker of Magellans is waiting now for his own trip around the world . And he has waited a long time . Donald K. Slayton has been an astronaut for a quarter of his 48 years . No man has been one longer . Yet never has he felt the lurch of 7 million pounds of thrust under him or seen the magnificence of an earth turning beneath him . He has not been in orbit over a moonscape or ever kicked lunar dust . But he has seen to it that other men have . Deke Slayton was one of the original seven American Mercury astronauts . He was scheduled to fly the seventh manned flight UPI photo . Slay toff is tired.of waiting into space in the early sixties . But the space doctors said he had a heart murmur and he was taken off space flight status in August , 1959 . Given management job But he had a gift for management and a way with his fellow astronauts . So he was made director of flight crew operations for manned space flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manned flights it was Deke Slayton who said who would go Into space and who would n't , who would be the first man to step on the moon and who would be the last . But more than anything else on earth or in space , he wanted to go himself . And he never gave up hope . Finally last March , after 10 years of never giving the medical department any rest , he was found sound and put back on flight status Time , however , is fast running out on Deke Slayton , He has already named the nine astronauts who will fly the three Skylab earth orbiting missions beginning next April . He has already picked the astronauts who would test fly the first space shuttles at the end of the decade . // *Deke Slayton wants a ride // Only three unfilled seats remain on an American spaceship in his time . They are all on the mission to meet the Russians , when three astronauts will rendezvous in earth orbit with two Soviet cosmonauts . Deke never named those . In the mid-afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soyuz spaceship is to lift off toward orbit . Seven and a half hours later , when it is by then mid-afternoon in Florida , an Apollo spacecarft will also lift toward orbit . Within hours the two spacecarft will approach one another . With the Apollo spaceship doing the jockeying , the two will finally dock and lock together . The two crews will cross over to one another 's spacecraft ; and for two days the two craft and their five spacemen will float through space together . For the first time in history two tongues will address one another in space . But it wo n't be a babble . Entire corps eligible Deke Slayton , for one , the test pilot from Sparta , Wisc. , is already studying Russian . Nor is he the only one . Tom Stafford , another senior American astronaut , is speaking it and . has been the American astronaut in closestliaison with Russian cosmonauts in early negotiations for the mission . Thirty-nine astronauts , the entire corps , are eligible for this special mission , which is designed to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plow needed new ground in international rescue capability in space . Deke Slayton lets the world know in ways subtle and unsubtle that he wants a seat on that Apollo . He has told Christopher Columbus Kraft , director of the Manned Spacecraft Center , that he is through sending other men into space , that he wants to go himself . Dr Kraft will pick the astronauts early next year . Some have speculated grandly here that a trio of the nation 's most senior astronauts ? Deke Slayton , Tom Stafford , and Allan Shepard ? ought to go : one a shaper of the destiny of astronauts , another an ? Air Force general , the third a Navy admiral ? one who has never flown in space , two have flown to the moon . If indeed such a trio goes to meet the Russians , then the manned space program would see one of its most ironic anomalies . Deke Slayton , the maker of Columbuses , would be the rookie on the mission .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
