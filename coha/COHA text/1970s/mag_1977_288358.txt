World population growth-and how to slow it-continues to be a subject of great controversy . The planet 's poorest nations have yet to find effective ways to check their population increase-at least without restricting citizens ' rights and violating such traditions as the custom of having large families as insurance in old age . India 's new government , for example , has abandoned coercive birth control procedures , even though the country , with a population of 635 million , is growing by a million new people per month . The U.S. National Security Council has said that runaway population growth is " a threat to our national security . " Nonetheless , some analysts see cause for hope-if action is taken in time . Among them is World Bank President Robert S. McNamara , who examined the status of the Malthusian threat and what can be done about it in a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Excerpts : <P> Except for thermonuclear war , population growth is the gravest issue the world faces over the decades immediately ahead . In many ways it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it is less subject to rational safeguards , and less amenable to organized control . It is not in the exclusive control of a few governments , but rather in the hands of hundreds of millions of individual parents . The population threat must be faced-like the nuclear threat-for what it inevitably is : a central determinant of mankind 's future , one requiring far more attention than it is presently receiving . <P> Last year the world 's population passed 4 billion . Barring a holocaust brought on by man or nature , the world 's population right now is the smallest it will ever be again . How did it reach 4 billion ? For the first 99% of man 's existence , surprisingly slowly . For the last 1% of history , in a great rush . By 1750 , the total had reached only about 800 million . Then , as the Industrial Revolution gathered momentum , population growth began rapidly to accelerate . By 1900 , it had doubled to 1.6 billion ; by 1964 , it had doubled again to 3.2 billion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projected to double again to about 6.3 billion . Given today 's level of complacency in some quarters , and dis couragement in others , the likely scenario is for a world stabilized at about 11 billion . <P> The sudden population surge has been a function of two opposite trends : the gradual slowing down of the growth rate in the developed nations , and the rapid acceleration of the rate in the developing countries . The experience of the developed countries gave rise to the theory of the demographic transition . It holds that societies tend to move through three distinct demographic stages : 1 ) high birth rates and high death rates , resulting in near stationary populations ; 2 ) high birth rates but declining death rates , producing growing populations ; and finally , 3 ) low birth rates and low death rates , re-establishing near stationary populations . <P> The fundamental question is : What , if anything , can rationally and humanely be done to accelerate the demographic transition in the developing world ? Is that acceleration realistically possible ? It is.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
