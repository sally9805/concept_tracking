To win a pennant in the National League it seems a certain type of manager is required . He must be strong , quiet and patient . Some years he is named Walter Alston , others Red Schoendienst , Gil Hodges , Sparky Anderson , Johnny Keane or Danny Murtaugh. // So how docs Bill Virdon fit in as the new manager of the world champion Pittsburgh Pirates ? " There will be a difference between Murtaugh and Virdon , " says Pitcher Steve Blass . " Murtaugh was a man with a sense of humor . I remember the first time I ever pitched for him and he gave me the ball and said , ' Steve , go out there and pitch three innings or four hours , whichever comes first . ' Another time I was pitching in spring training and was wild as could be . Danny came to the mound and asked me what was the matter . I told him I just could n't seem to find the plate . ' Rather remarkable , ' he said . ' It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Nobody can judge what kind of humor Bill Virdon possesses until the Pirates go through their first losing streak , which may be never . If there is a problem , it could be the pitching . The biggest Pirate winner was Dock Ellis , the famed bed-measurer , with a record of 19-9 . But Ellis finished the season with a sore elbow and a shaky record of 5-6 following the All-Star break . Blass was 15-8 , Bob Moose 11-7 , Luke Walker 10-8 and Nelson Briles 8-4 , not bad but not overpowering . The relievers are better . Young Bruce Kison won plaudits for his relief performance in the Series , but still ranks behind Dave Giusti . Over the last two years Giusti has saved 56 games and won 14 others and that totals 70 . He also worked four games in the playoffs against San Francisco in addition to three against the Orioles . His ERA for those was 0.00. // Roberto Clemente needs only 118 hits to reach 3,000 . And there are all those other hitters : Manny Sanguillen , Richie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gene Clines , Willie Stargell . Stargell had an operation on his knee after last season and Pittsburgh needs a healthy Willie . // While the Pirates can dwell on then accomplishments of last year , the Chicago Cubs begin with their usual hangover . Dissension was rampant in the clubhouse , and near the end of the season Owner Phil Wrigley placed ads in the papers in support of Durocher . Time and excuses are running out on the Cubs . They are aging but , should certain things fall into place , they could win the division . Durocher 's future could be determined during the first two weeks when the Cubs meet Pittsburgh six times one-third of the seasonal total . A good showing in these games would bring Chicago to life ; a bad one will put Leo 's head on the block . // Much of the hope for a successful season lies in the knees of Randy Hundley , " He 's not only our catcher , " says Reliever Phil Regan , " he 's our leader . " From 1966 to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has only 82 games of work . Both of Hundley 's knees have undergone surgery . " Purely as a wild guess , " says the team doctor , Jacob Suker , " Randy may be able to catch 100 and some odd games . " // The major off-season maneuvers for the Cubs centered around building an outfield that could cope with the artificial surfaces in the league . Rick Monday came from Oakland and Jose Cardenal from Milwaukee and they will play center and right fields . Monday has now completed his military obligation and that should help him . Over the last five years he has averaged only 124 games a season . Harnessing Jose Cardenal has not been easy . If Durocher can draw the best from him , Chicago will have a very fast base runner with adequate power plus a hitter who can deliver runs . // With a splendid opportunity to win in 1971 , Chicago folded in August , and Durocher was criticized for not using his bullpen correctly . But his hitters were really to blame and the starters had to struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Award while Milt Pap-pas ( 17-14 ) had his winningest season . The failure of the team to hit hurt Bill Hands ( 12-18 ) more than any other pitcher . From the end of June to the middle of September , Hands was cuffed . He won only one game and lost 10 , and during the losses the Cubs scored only 14 runs . The fourth starter is Burt Hooton , the team 's No. 1 draft choice last June who has only 21 innings of big league experience . The last word on the Cubbies , of course , must come from Ernie Banks , now a coach . " Something old , something new , the Cubs will do in ' 72 , " said Ernie. // Montreal 's goal last year was lo play .500 ball . It missed by 10 wins but even so the Expos were fifth for the first time after consecutive last-place finishes . " We did finish ahead of the Phillies , " Manager Gene Mauch says , " but I really do n't know if we moved ahead of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lineup will be basically the same with Rusty Staub ( 19 HRs , 97 RBIs .311 ) the big man in the attack along with Bob Bailey ( 14 , 83 , .251 ) . // Pitching is Montreal 's big asset . Carl Morton was 10-18 following his fine 18-victory rookie season . " He had tenderness in his elbow , " Mauch says . Steve Renko won 15 games and Ernie McAnally was one of the better pitchers after the All-Star break with a 10-4 record following a 1-8 first half . But the best Montreal pitcher was Bill Stone-man ( 17-16 ) , a 28-year-old righthander. // Fans in Philadelphia are being asked to " Join the Vet Set " at Veterans Stadium as the Phillies try to scratch their way up from sixth place . There is some hope , but again this will be a year of development for a franchise trying to alter its image . Two fine things happened last year : the development of Willie ( The Phillie ) Montanez into an outfielder who can make things happen ( 30 HRs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best shortstop in the league . Over the last two seasons Bowa has made only 24 errors even though he had to make the adjustment from real grass to fake , and his .987 fielding average set a major league record . // The young Philly outfield has possibilities in one of those rare new ball parks where the home run is not an impossibility . Only Atlanta Stadium , with 186 home runs , provided a better target than Veterans Stadium ( 153 ) . Mike Anderson is up from Eugene , Ore. , where he and Greg Luzinski each had 36 . Roger breed was a huge disappointment ( only six homers , 37 RBIs ) but he hit .346 in the month of September . // Catcher Tim McCarver was three points above his lifetime average of .275 in 1971 and provides much of the spark for a team that needs all it can get . First baseman Deron Johnson had a good year with 34 HRs and 95 RBIs. // What does Manager Frank Lucchesi do about his pitching staff ? He prays for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a four-month , 11-game losing streak and Chris Short had a record of 7-14 . Woodie Fryman came out of the bullpen after the first half of the season lo produce a six-game winning streak and a 10-7 record . By getting Steve Carlton the Phils seem to be overdoing left-handed pitching . The Rick Wise-for-Carlton trade deprived Phillie fans of one of their favorites , and Carlton may hear those famous boos if he does n't get oil " to a smart start . // One of the good moves the organization made was to pick up Tommy Hutton from the Dodgers . Hutton , a fine fielding first baseman , hit very well in the minors and his .352 average , 117 runs scored , 46 doubles and 103 RBIs made him the MVP in the Pacific Coast League . // Seldom has a team been written out of a pennant race as quickly as the New York Mets . Such judgments could prove very wrong . New York thrives on its pitching and seems to die with its hitting ; at least that was the ease last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gave up two runs or less . Unfortunately , in 70 games the hitters produced two runs or less . ( Imagine the possibilities if Met pitchers got a whack at Met hitters. ) // Attempts to help the attack generated a trade with the California Angels that brought Jim Fregosi to New York as a third baseman . Fregosi , six limes the AL 's All-Star shortstop , hurt a thumb this spring and now must overcome the injury , learn to play a new position and adapt to National League pitching . // Beyond that , the basic east of characters is unchanged . With Fregosi or Wayne Garrett at third , the infield will be composed of Ed Kranepool , Ken Boswell and Bud Harrelson , hardly names to wake up any echoes of the 1929 Yankees . Still , the same cast played in a World Series . Jerry Grote will catch and is trying to alter his obstreperous reputation . Cleon Jones hit .319 but drove in only 69 runs , and Tommie Agee 's homer production dropped from 24 to 14 , although his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Milner will play right field . // One worry for Manager Gil Hodges prior to the opener was the condition of Tom Seaver 's arm . Seaver 's five-year record is 95-54 and any continuation of arm trouble might cause the franchise to slip into the muck of Flushing Bay . " Anytime you can run Seaver through the league 35 to 40 times you 've got a chance , " says Montreal 's Gene Mauch . Behind Seaver comes Gary Gentry , seemingly more mature but the holder of a lifetime record of only 34-32 . The Mets are still concerned about Jerry Koosman 's left arm . Following his first two seasons of 36-21 , the next two produced only 18-18 and the team wants him to use his fastball more than Koosman wants to use it . Tug McGraw and Damn Frisella formed one of the best bull pens in either league last year . // In many ways the second-place finish of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1971 was unexpected , both to the organization and the fans . Despite one horrendous month , June , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell from first place , 2 ? games in front , to fourth , nine games behind , the Cards rallied themselves and also broke four young players into frontline positions . // Reggie Cleveland ( 12-12 ) stepped in as a rookie and walked an average of only 2.15 batters every nine innings , while Jerry Reuss ( 14-14 ) proved to be the fourth winningest lefthander in the league despite his inconsistency and an ERA of 4.78. // The other two positions filled were center field , where Jose Cruz worked well and hit .274 , and catcher , where Ted Simmons hit .304 with 77 RBIs and produced 12 game-winning hits . St. Louis led the major leagues in hitting last year with .275 but its pitchers compiled an IRA of 3.85 , 22nd in the big leagues . Bob Gibson needs only five victories to become the team 's alltime winner and will be joined by Wise ( 17-14 with Philadelphia ) , Cleveland and Reuss to make up four of the five arms needed in Red Schoendienst 's pitching rotation . Finding the fifth pitcher proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sore spot in 1971 , should be improved . Finally , the Cardinals seem to have recovered the spirit so helpful in their winning years .
