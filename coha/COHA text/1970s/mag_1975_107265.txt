From the beginning it was a golf tournament that begged to be forgotten , one that was called everything from the Sauna Bath Classic to the Lost Ego Invitational , so it was probably appropriate that last Monday , on still another steamy afternoon in Chicago , a rather invisible journeyman professional named Lou Graham finally brought this U.S. Open championship to a merciful conclusion . Being the last human being alive out there on the damp , insufferably humid premises of the Medinah Country Club with all of its inconvenient forests , Graham became the Open winner by beating young John Mahaffey in an 18-hole playoff , doing it with the nonchalance and lack of bother that had accompanied his performance throughout the week . The best thing about Graham winning is that whenever he captures a tournament , as he has twice before , it gets canceled . And if the U.S. Open is now going to turn into the kind of event that was on display at Medinah , it might be better remembered as a relic of the past . // There can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a John Mahaffey got into the playoff in the first place , after tying over the regulation 72 holes with the uninspired three-over-par total of 287 , is that , if nothing else , they are straight hitters off the tee . Graham has a kind of flippy swing and just keeps hitting low shots out there a safe distance , never very far off line , except on rare occasions when he happens to remember he is in an Open . And Mahaffey , while being a slightly more stylish swinger , is nonetheless one of the PGA tour 's most accurate hitters. // In the Monday confrontation they each played exactly as they had during the previous four rounds . Steady , unspectacular golf . Down the fairway , on the green . After three holes they were tied at one over . Graham then made two straight birdies and after four routine holes he made another . So with eight holes to play he had a three-shot lead and it was only a question of whether he could keep forgetting this was the Open , because Mahaffey was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all week . // With a minimum of drama , Graham did exactly what he needed to do . Oh , he staggered a bit with a couple of bogeys on the last five holes , but he was headed for an even par 71 , and Mahaffey could do no better than a 73. // Graham is what you would call a " good old country boy " from Nashville . At 37 , and after 12 years on the tour , he had won only a thing in Minnesota and a Liggett &amp; Myers Open nobody saw , and both have since disappeared . // Mahaffey , by contrast , is one of the tour 's young turks who is going to be around a long time . He 's a University of Houston guy , an NCAA champion , a kid who swept out the shop for Jimmy Demaret and Jack Burke at Champions , and he has played in skin games with Ben Hogan and a few rich oilmen  --  and won . He is known as the " waggle leader " on the tee , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that there was much to mimic at Medinah. // " This course was never as difficult as the scores looked , " Mahaffey said . " I agree with everybody who said it was the easiest Open in history to have won . At least 10 guys could have won it by five shots if they 'd played golf . " // But in the end , as the pack of contenders  --  most notably Jack Nicklaus , Frank Beard , Tom Watson and Ben Crenshaw  --  collapsed , only Mahaffey and Lou Graham played golf at Medinah. // Why ? // In many ways it is fun to watch a group of 18-handicappers play a $100 Nassau , as much fun as there is in the annoying game of golf . You can laugh as they work their hooks around and through the trees , hot-line their sand shots into access roads and get headaches limping after their putts , which slide onward and downward away from the cup , or pull up woefully short . But to have witnessed it in the U.S. Open from a collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never  --  never , ever  --  have been that difficult was an experience not soon to be forgotten . // One reason for all the bumbling was that the event was the Open , which always tightens the throat and causes awkward and uncharacteristic things to happen , even occasionally to a Jack Nicklaus . But many of the stars who were so humiliated by Medinah last week have participated in scads of Opens that were held on tougher courses , Opens in which they performed well , if not brilliantly . So that alone was not the answer . // All right , then , let 's consider the fact that Medinah was a tight driving course , with those 4,000 or so trees out there on the outskirts of Chicago . Fine . It was narrow , which is one reason a couple of the tour 's straightest hitters wriggled their way into that playoff . But there have been tighter fairways in the Open , such as those at Oakland Hills in 1961 , or those that some veterans have seen at Olympic and Merion and Southern Hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they have played " fast , " as the pros say , meaning the ball would race through the target areas and into a deeper , more menacing rough than Medinah had . // One can only wonder what this distressed field of 1975 , which developed a simultaneous case of the yanks and yips , would have scored had Medinah played as hard as it might have without the rains early in the week that softened the greens and made it , by everyone 's admission , much easier . The softness made it possible for many a player to scramble his way to a par , or a bogey . With the greens holding just about anything golfers threw at them , a guy could put his tee shot off in the groves , chip out to the fairway , and then stick a rescue shot up there and make his putt and go on to the next tee . Ho hum , another routine four . On the normal Open premises he would have been struggling simply to stay alive . // Nobody even suggested that Medinah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " easiest " Open course he could remember playing , but he played poorly nearly all the way through the four rounds except for that one steady surge that put him into contention on Sunday . Even then he saved his poorest play for the moments immediately thereafter when he could easily have won . Namely the last three holes , when Sam Sausage could have spotted him two-up and won Golden Bear , Inc. // So what did it all mean ? If the course was n't that much of a monster , why did the game 's best players provide the record crowds of Medinah and millions more watching television some of the most atrocious exhibitions of non-golf within anyone 's memory ? // Over and over , a competitor of grand repute would step up on a tee , remove some sort of club from his bag and hit some kind of shot that would look as if it was doing stunts in the air . The high , disappearing hook became a trademark for Nicklaus , and it was that all along for the scrambling but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmare for Watson , who had dominated the play for two days with rounds of 67 and 68 , tying the 36-hole Open record . When Beard took command after a 67 on Saturday , he quickly reverted back to his old ways of hooking everything down to the putter . As Beard gradually let his game erode on Sunday , his old friends were reminded of what he always said of himself : " My fade only hooks 20 yards . " // The plain fact of the matter is that last week at Medinah all the best players , the favorites , played pretty awful , and the guys who stayed in contention , including the two who managed to give the Open its 26th playoff in 75 years , shot just about what they normally might have been expected to shoot . // Johnny Miller , for example , was never the remotest factor in the tournament . Gary Player 's name was never mentioned . Lee Trevino 's was for a couple of days , but on Saturday , when he and Nicklaus needed to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogeys between them on an ideal day for scoring . Trevino managed to do even worse on Sunday , when he shot 79. // Saturday was the day the tournament had the youthful glamour of a Watson-Crenshaw pairing , with 25-year-old Watson holding a lead and supposedly having cured himself of blowing tournaments as he had so often in the past . And here was 23-year-old Crenshaw , back from a terrible slump . The wave of the future . Terrific . // What they did in 18 holes was to make one birdie between them as Watson fumbled it away again with a 78 and Crenshaw shot 76 . Watson almost four-putted the first green from about 20 feet as his knees buckled , and Crenshaw hit his occasional " looking for Jane " drive , meaning that he sometimes drives into Tarzan 's part of the jungle . Later that night , when Crenshaw was asked if he and Watson had much to say to each other during the round , Ben laughed . // " We never saw each other , " he said . // This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 67 to move past nine players in the field and pick up 11 strokes on Watson , taking a three-stroke lead . // " This course is n't that hard , " Beard said . " Being where I am with a 67 is the greatest ripoff since Riggs and King . " // Let us now ponder the various ways this Open was lost by so many people on Sunday . For Beard it can be said that he simply let it slide slowly away because his confidence left him . Being a negative thinker anyway , Beard just sort of strolled along , looking at every shot and putt as if to say , " It figures . " // Watson will have a harder time living with his performances of Saturday and Sunday , especially since they follow so many others of the past , the sort of thing he is supposed to be overcoming by now . Watson is from Stanford . Perhaps he thinks too much . // Crenshaw was far from as upset as one might have thought him to be . He was tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was in fact hitting the ball better than he had on the previous days . Finally , after a long wait on the 17th tee , he hit a two-iron not quite hard enough to clear the water on Medinah 's postcard hole . The result was a killer double bogey on a hole he had played perfectly for three rounds . // " I ca n't complain , " Ben said . " I got away with murder for a couple of days . I had a super putting week . It was really great to be in there and find out what it 's like . " // As for Pat Fitzsimons , or Peter Oosterhuis , or any of those other people who perhaps had fleeting thoughts of winning , they went the way that most players go in the Open who wear wrinkled pants and appear to have their wallets in their hip pockets , as Fitzsimons did , or who stand 6 ' 5 " and look silly in a cap , as Oosterhuis did . // The most truly amazing thing of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods and creeping back . Hale Irwin , the defending champion , and Bob Murphy finished early with four-over-par 288s , well off the lead , yet eventually missed the playoff by only one stroke . Even more amazing was how Nicklaus , with the leaders all but handing him the Open  --  with the entire city trying to give it to him  --  played the final three holes . Nicklaus was two under par for the day , working on a 69 , when he went to the 16th tee . He was also one stroke off the pace , but , as everyone figured , a finish of par-par-par would win him his fourth Open as surely as there was a Shriner in Medinah 's membership . // Probably not even Graham or Mahaffey would have bet against Jack at this point . But what Nicklaus did was hit as glorious a hook from the 16th tee as anyone is humanly capable of hitting . He bogeyed that one . Then he went to the 17th and put an iron over the green , right of the hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could pull off a decent chip shot . A chip ? Nicklaus ? Who was kidding whom ? He did n't get it on the green , and when he finally did , he had to sink a 20-foot putt just to make a bogey . // Now then , as bad off as Nicklaus was , things were getting worse behind him , and had he somehow been able to birdie the 18th he would have wound up in a tie . But just to cap off this splendid display , Jack hooked his drive on 18 , hit his second into a bunker , and then played an uninspired sand shot and missed the putt , finishing up with the hat trick . His final score was 289 , two strokes behind Graham and Mahaffey , one behind Crenshaw , Beard , Murphy and Irwin , and one stroke ahead of Watson . // " The soft course in the first two rounds forced me to hit shots I do n't like to hit , " Jack said . " I thought I 'd play well on Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of artificial swing , because I have to hit so many right-to-left shots on this course . What happened on the last three holes ? I think you can say the artificial swing caught up with me. " // One of the more astonishing things about the finish is that the last two hours of the tournament proper produced only one birdie . This was a putt that Graham managed to squeeze into the cup out on the 14th hole . That against a score of bogeys. // After all of the gory things that went on during the final round , the 1975 Open ended up like so many old-fashioned Opens did , with one guy  --  Mahaffey  --  waiting around the clubhouse to see if anybody could stay alive long enough to tie him . And it took another guy , Graham , to make a bogey to do it . // Some folks thought it might have provided the most Open thrills since 1899 , when Willie Smith won by 11 with a closing 77.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
