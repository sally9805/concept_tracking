txt Iran , where civilization flourished while Europe was barbarian , is today a country that can not feed itself . The ruler , Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi , promises greatness , but 70 per cent of the people are illiterate and 60 per cent live at subsistence levels . Hundreds of villages are without doctors although oil revenues are flowing into the national treasury . Despite the harsh statistics , however , the Government says that.it has begun to eliminate ignorance and poverty . The per , capita income of $1,000 is less than half of that in many provincial regions , Indeed , incomes are rising in Teheran , where there seem to he more young men on motorcycles than there are beggars . Some of the educated and affluent Iranian expatriates abroad for years are said to be thinking of coming home . And to offer hope to those who never left , the Shah and his Government announce almost daily that they will spend more and more and more above the $32-billion originally allotted for the five-year development plan . that began last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had the plans to rebuild his country . Now , apparently , he has the money , and the problem of pumping it into the economy without causing disastrous inflation . And with authoritarian control of Iran and her growing oil income , the monarch has begun a radical revision of his Government and of the scope of his ambitious programs for this rich but underdeveloped nation . The purpose of the restructuring is to accelerate and expand the social and economic plans that the Shah says will lead Iran to " great civilization . " The Shah 's vision for Iran , through the programs he calls " the Shah- people revolution , " is to press the country first into dominance in the Middle East and southern Asia , and later into the forefront of international affairs as a major world power . Meanwhile , Iran must import staple foods , machinery , engineers and technicians , and planes , tanks , artillery and warships . The Shah 's revolution is a collection of plans that he acknowledges has a socialist orientation , but he asserts that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reshaping of the Government and the plans include proposals to give regional officials more power to put Government decisions into effect as they see fit . But this does not imply that the Shah will relax his unchallenged grip on national affairs . As constitutional monarch , with the legal and political power to dissolve Parliament and to remove the Premier , he is expected to retain virtually absolute control . The Shah 's critics say he is an oppressive ruler who jails and executes his political opponents . The monarch replies that only dangerous plotters are jailed and only terrorists executed . Hope and Awe Iranians are responding to the Shah and his programs with new hope and traditional awe . These attitudes are tempered by the realization that , barring unforeseen disruptions , the Shah 's way is the only way in Iran . He has been monarch for 33 years and survived at least two reported assassination attempts . In addition to his political power , he is considered by devout Iranians the caretaker of Iranian life under the tenets of Shiism , the predominant Moslem sect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , known by the Iranian acronym Savak . This state force is reliably reported to permeate all levels of Iranian lite and to keep close surveillance on those considered potential dissidents . For these reasons , Iranian intellectuals , students , businessmen and Government officials rarely discuss possible misgivings about the Shah with anyone but their most trusted friends . and virtually never with foreigners . And the Shah himself seems to be watching . His picture hangs ubiquitously on office walls , in shop windows , behind counters , in restaurants and hotels , showing him standing on a hill with clouds behind his head , posing in a Boy Scout uniform , smiling proudly with his family . His image is easily more visible in Teheran than Lenin 's is in Moscow or President Nixon 's is In American post offices . ' Shah Runs the Show ' " The . Shah runs the show , " said a businessman in Teheran . An Iranian Government official , politely telling , a foreigner that Iranian . Government officials do not criticize the Shah and his work , said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things ' we can talk about . Perhaps carpets . " , . Since the early nineteensixties , when there were riots in the streets of Teheran , the Shah has tightened his control to the extent that there is not a public squeak of dissidence . The mullahs , or Moslem religious leaders , who do not like his reforms ? especially those that threaten their real .. estate holdings ? helped stimulate the opposition in the ' nineteen-sixties : Today their opposition has been reduced , according to knowledgeable diplomats , to grurnblings in the provinces . Student dissent is also muffled to inaudibility . While Iranian students abroad protest and demonstrate against the . Shah , their brothers and cousins at home are carefully controlled . in the heart of Teheran , the national university is surrounded by. , a wall only a . commando could . clithb . The ? gates are guarded and visitors must have Government , passes to enter . " The last place to find out what students have on their minds is Teheran University , " said one Western diplomat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her cities , is getting rich . In Teheran , new office and apartment buildings sprout in gray and tan , limited only by the world cement shortage . The new affluence also takes other forms , such as streets cluttered with erratically driven cars that have made motorcyclists ride , at slightly reduced speeds , on sidewalks among pedestrians . There are expensive continental restaurants and cabarets with singers and dancers all the way from England and America , There are European opera and ballet and chamber music and the violence , dubbed into Persian , of Western adventure movies . There are elaborate plans to renovate the slums of south Teheran . Along the bumpy , narrow , perilous road from Teheran to Isfahan , which thrived as the Persian capital two centuries ago , many people in the towns still live in bakedearth houses and huts . There is an occasional television aerial . But the predominant physical features of life between the cities are parched , Cam emu The Shah of Iran brown hills and desert that lead to a great salt lake . In Isfahan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short walk from the exquisite blue of the tiled mosques and the expensive blue of the turquoise , set in gold , that is in shop windows waiting for tourists , most of them Iranians . Widespread hopes for a richer future here are tied to the money that been arriving since oil prices were raised late last year . Iran now collects about $1-billion a month from her oil customers . Although the money has made the Shah 's planned revisions possible , it has also aggravated the problem of balancing progress against inflation . The new money  --  national income of $4-billion last year is expected to grow to $20-billion  --  has created an urgent need for a bureaucracy that is almost infinitely more efficient than Iran is used to . For decades , the middle , lower and sometimes higher levels of Government have been cluttered with well-connected people who do too little and take too long to do it . In an effort to change this , the Shah has replaced seven Cabinet ministers , transferred others and added several new ones . He has aso apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dismissal last month of the commandant and two other generals of the provincial police , reportedly for graft . The new order of Government also includes decentralization , tightening of fiscal planning and management and the realignment of overlapping and underlapping ministries and departments . New Catalyst The chief new catalyst in the Government , taking his directions from the Shah and Premier Amir Abbas Hoveida , is Dr. Jamshid Amouzgar , the former Finance Minister and Iran 's principal official in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . Dr. Amouzgar , who has a reputation as an excellent administrator , was educated at Teheran University and at Cornell . As the new Interior Minister , he is charged with streamlining the bureaucracy ; supervising local and parliamentary elections and putting decentralization proposals into effect . As Premier Hoveida , who has held his post for nine years , tries to stimulate the Government to action , the Shah travels about his arid , dusty land  --  about as large as the European Common Market nations combined ? urging the 33 million citizens to work for the goals he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarch reminds Iranians of past grandeur ; 2,500 years ago the Persian Empire stretched from the Asian subcontinent to North Africa and southeastern Europe . And ? he promises them more of virtually all good things . But he also warns that Iran 's industrial base must be built now , because her oil reserves will not last forever . The Shah estimates that they will last 30 to 60 years . While his promises do not herald the coming of paradise  --  the word is an old Persian one originally meaning the King 's preserve ? they do specifically envision more food , hospitals , housing , consumer goods and general amelioration ' of the country 's ills . In a speech recently to ' a national committee studying Iran 's problems , the Shah said : " By the time the oil reserves are depleted , we will have been in the great civilization for years . Everyone must contribute his own share , especially in production , Failure to produce will lead you nowhere but to bankruptcy , meaning that the great civilization you have struggled to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into poverty and backwardness .
