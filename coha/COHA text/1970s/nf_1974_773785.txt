txt Table In turn these groups interrelate , in various configurations , with other systems of vocabulary items ? the terms for light and darkness , calendar terminology , social occasions ( e.g. the names of mealtimes ) and so on . The senses of morning and evening in the two expressions from which we started are established by the places which these words occupy in the vocabulary-system of English . One very simple structural factor which contributes to their sense , for instance , is that they fall into a three-term sub-system , and if there were no term afternoon , the senses of morning and evening would be different from their senses in the three-term system . It is knowledge of structural facts such as this which defines an English speaker 's grasp of his vocabulary : that is to say , vocabulary competence can be represented as knowledge of senses . The sense of any word is an internal property of language structure . In the spirit of Ullmann 's caution against atomism ' , we are led to view the vocabulary as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sense ) to each vocabulary item ; and away from the approach which takes one word at a time and focuses on the way it relates to the world of non-linguistic referents . The linguist 's notion of sense ' depends on a view of language as a structured system . We have seen how Ferdinand de Saussure stressed the idea of system in language . Fittingly , it was he who developed the concept of system in such a way as to map out a framework for the scientific study of the facts of semantic structure . He does not use the term sense . His basic semantic distinction is between signification and value . His signification ' does not coincide exactly with reference ' , but value ' corresponds well with our requirements for sense ' . Signification in Saussure 's approach is a property of individual signs : and a sign is an indivisible union of a signifiant or acoustic image and a signifi8 or concept . The signifiant is an abstract psychological representation of the phonetic level of a word ; sign fld is an abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse ? of a referent , perhaps , but not inevitably . So if one knows the signification of a linguistic sign ? say the Latin arbor , tree ' , to take one of Saussure 's examples ? one knows how to pronounce it and how to associate it with the correct referent , and this is one unified piece of knowledge ; over and over again Saussure stresses the indivisibility of signifier and signified . Because signification , like reference , is deficient as an account of 50 Words and their components meaning-structure in language , Saussure introduces the notion of value to complete the semantic model . Suppose that I learn the signification of the English word tree : that a native speaker points at a tree and says to me That 's a tree ' . The signifier has been fused with a signified by the method of ostensive definition ? saying the word and indicating its referent by gesture or other non-linguistic means . Having come to understand the signification of tree in this way , do I know its meaning ? Not necessarily . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it relates to other terms in relevant sections of the vocabulary . Part of the meaning of tree is that it is not a shrub or a bush ; that it may be part of a wood , or a forest , or a grove , spinney , copse , etc. ; that it has a trunk , bark , branches , twigs , leaves , etc . Readers who find this example fanciful or simpleminded may like to consider their knowledge of terms in technical areas in which they are not expert ; if one can not imagine not knowing the full meaning of tree , what about laser , pulsar , quantum , algorithm , phoneme , watt , neuron , ionization ? I think it would generally be conceded that one does not properly know the meaning of an isolated scientific term unless one also knows the meanings of adjacent terms in the semantic field : that is to say , one must know its sense or value , which is derived from the relation of one term to others ? in fact , ultimately from the relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saussure 's general statement of this thesis is as follows : Language is a system of interdependent terms in which the value of each term results solely from the simultaneous presence of the others ... ' ( p. 114 ) . He offers an analogy which explains the co-operation of signification and value in determining the meaning of signs : To determine what a five-franc piece is worth one must therefore know : ( 1 ) that it can be exchanged for a fixed quantity of a different thing , e.g. bread ; and ( 2 ) that it can be compared with a similar value of the same system , e.g. a one-franc piece , or with coins of another system ( a dollar , etc . ) . In the same way a word can be exchanged for something dissimilar , an idea ; besides , it can be compared with something of the same nature , another word ( p. 115 ) . Saussure makes it clear that value ' is not a property of lexical systems alone : units at the syntactic and phonological levels , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in systems . The value of a French plural does not coincide with that of a Sanskrit plural even though their signification is usually identical ; Sanskrit has three numbers instead of two . . . ; it would be wrong to attribute the same value to the plural in Sanskrit and in French ; 51 Words and their components its value clearly depends on what is outside and around it ' ( p. 116 ) . But it is the value or sense of terms in lexical systems which most concerns us here . A final example of Saussure 's may be quoted : Modern French mouton can have the same signification as English sheep but not the same value , and this for several reasons , particularly because in speaking of a piece of meat ready to be served on the table , English uses mutton and not sheep . The difference in value between sheep and mutton is due to the fact that sheep has beside it a second term while the French word does not ( pp. 115 ? 16 ) . ( The point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their individual referential ties with denoted objects , but by their relationship to each other : their co-membership of a lexical set the members of which reciprocally define one another . We must now examine more closely the systematicity of the vocabulary of natural language . When we are studying a foreign language , we are often given the task of learning by rote groups of words , sometimes a group of words each day or each week . Progressively we accumulate ( hopefully ) a stock of many thousands of words connecting with a vast range of potential topics of discourse . The lexical competence we so acquire may add up to something of the kind which might be represented in a formal dictionary . But a conventional , alphabetically listed dictionary has a format which is not strictly appropriate to the lexicon we have internalized . There is no psycholinguistic evidence that , when we are presented with a new sentence in a language we know , we perform a kind of mental alphabetical scan , looking up the words in turn in some conveniently arranged lexical store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linguistic competence is structured , but not by the mechanics of alphabetization . The Oxford English Dictionary is a poor analogue ( but was never meant to be a model of known semantic structure ) ; a better one would be a production like Roget 's Thesaurus , which is an attempt to represent the conceptual structure of the lexicon in a consultable format . We are not concerned with matters of consultation and consultability here ? those questions are for psycholinguistics , not descriptive linguistics ? but we are concerned with structure . Perhaps , in this respect , the way many language-teaching programmes require us to build up our lexicon is significant . One day it is the vocabulary of the kitchen , the next day the set of lexical items connected with rail travel , then the lexicon of weights and measures . On each occasion we learn a set of words connected with some single area of 52 Words and their components experience ; the learning procedure recognizes that the vocabulary of a language can be seen as a collection of lexical sets or lexical systems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A semantic field reflects a coherent inventory of human ex-periences ; yet inventory ' is perhaps the wrong word , because it does not do justice to the organization of semantic fields : the word system ' is again appropriate . We will refer to the vocabulary content of a speaker 's linguistic competence ( grammars ) , as the lexicon , then ; by a familiar termino-logical ambiguity ( cf. p. 39 above ) , we must say that a ' grammar2 ' must contain ? in addition to other sorts of semantic device ? a lexicon . The lexicon is an overall structure of lexical sets ; and each set comprises a formally organized and therefore mutually defining collection of lexical items . If a visual image is helpful , the lexicon could be pictured as a network of partly overlapping circles , each circle covering a particular semantic field , as in Figure 2 . Very few semantic fields have so far been investigated , but it is clear that there are many thousands of them and that the lexical 53 Words and their components sets which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles . Anthropologists have studied some of the more obviously structured sets such as kinship terminologies ( which differ interestingly from language to language while preserving the same overall framework ) ; taxonomic ( classifying ) vocabularies for plant life ; colour terms , which again differ , perhaps surprisingly , from language to language . Differences include the number of basic terms which divide up the spectrum , the physical dimensions of the complex phenomenon colour ' appealed to in the basic classification ? difference of hue may be important in one language , luminosity in another , saturation in another . There may also be variations in the relationship between basic terms ( red , orange , yellow , etc. ) and subsidiary terms for finer discrimination ( crimson , scarlet , vermilion , gold , amber , azure , turquoise , etc. ) ; and in many cultures the basic stock of colour terms may be augmented by many more or less impermanent words and phrases to denote new colours ' as fashion demands ( bronze , olive , mustard , flame , peat , etc. ? all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention the dozens of temporary and fanciful colour terms pressed upon us each season by the manufacturers of paints and cars . The variation from language to language in the way the semantic field of colour is treated has frequently been discussed as evidence of the way different language-communities are ( allegedly , and improbably ) caused by their languages to engage with the world in distinctive perceptual manners , but there is no space to go into that thesis here . Other eminently researchable semantic fields are the terminologies belonging to specialist trades and technological activities ( e.g. there is a study of the French vocabulary connected with railways ) . Perhaps more important than any such study , however , would be the analysis of certain lexical sets by means of which we indicate the relationships and processes which obtain between objects and people . Two examples may be given . First , the set of verbs concerned with possession and change of possession : have , own , possess , obtain , lose , give , lend , take , borrow , donate , bequeath , share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of conceptual complexity much higher than any of the other examples so far given in this chapter : unlike the noun and adjective examples which can be simply tagged to concrete referents , these verbs designate states and processes and actions which demand the participation of objects and people in differing and fairly complicated ways . They are units of meaning which put other units of meaning into active relationship . Relational in a different way are adjectives of physical measurement : big , small , tall , short , long , wide , narrow , deep , shallow , fat , thin , broad , etc . These are implicitly relational because they are implicitly comparative : when 54 Words and their components we say that something is tall or long , we are saying that it is tall or long by comparison with a norm for objects of the appropriate kind . The above two sets of relational terms are examples of lexical sets which are peculiarly important in language . Since they sort things into classes , put things into regular juxtaposition , they are of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , to handle it linguistically as a meaningful pattern , not as a mere list or jumble of facts and perceptions . Before we look more closely at the semantic structure of lexical sets , two brief points of a general kind need to be made . First of all , in each of the sets referred to so far , all the example words belonged to the same part of speech ? all nouns , or all adjectives , etc . Community of syntactic category is not essential to the notion lexical set ' . We would agree that all the following lexical items belong to one set , the set corresponding to the semantic field of heat and heat variation : hot , cold , warm , freezing , icy , boiling , tepid , heat , warmth , chill , snow , ice , steam , burn , freeze , melt , roast , refrigerate , warmly , icily , and so on . It is immaterial that the parts of speech ' differ . Second , as the simple diagram of overlapping circles ( p. 53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items characteristically belong simultaneously to more than one set : roast and refrigerate belong to the vocabulary of cooking as well as to that of temperature , snow and ice are part of the diction of meteorology as well as that of temperature . Because the lexical sets I have offered so far have been very informally presented , I have been able to get away with invoking a referential criterion in assembling and discussing the sample lexical sets : ' connection with a single area of experience ' of course makes appeal to a referential tie between sets of lexical items and the sets of things and perceptions they designate . I do not deny that language is referential , and thus it is to be expected that lexical sets will to a large extent correspond with experiential fields . However , large areas of language are non-referential , so we can not depend on a referential criterion to explain all meaning in language , and , as I have said , it is not a very reliable criterion anyway . It is necessary to devise what might be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of lexical relationships in general : that is , an approach which can offer explanations of semantic patterning and which is not dependent on appeal to factors outside language . Is it possible to break down the meanings ? the senses ? of words into units , linguistic units , which show what it is that certain words have in common , and what causes others to be thought of as distinct ? Are there semantic components of lexical items ? If so , how do we get at them ? One analytic procedure would be to divide up words into their linear constituents or morphemes. 55 Words and their components Evidently , blackboard and hardboard divide up into black , hard and board , and tigress and actress yield the morphemes tiger , actor ( itself segmentable ) and - ess . These segmentations do tell us something about the meanings of the words concerned ? that a blackboard is a board which is black , hardboard is board which is hard , a tigress is a female tiger and an actress a female actor . But the next thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meaning are pretty uninformative . We still have not achieved any kind of insight into the meanings of black , board , - ess , etc . If meaning can be broken down into components , the analysis must reveal the components of simple as well as complex words . It is clear that the minute analysis of meaning can not be achieved by simple linear segmentation ; if words possess internal structure , it is structure more abstract than linear structure , and not at all observable . The prevalent attitude nowadays is that a lexical item is a complex cluster of semantic components , the components being selections from among features which are present latently in the semantic structure of the language as a whole , and the specific lexical item being a convergence of components selected from that wider network of meaning . We would , then , propose a process of atomization ' of meaning or componential analysis ' : instead of looking for signs of meaning on the surface , we suppose the existence of covert semantic entities . The nature and relationships of these entities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lexical items . A preliminary note on terminology : various linguists speak of semantic components ' , semantic features ' , semantic markers ' . I will try to make a systematic terminological distinction between semantic components and semantic features : the former will designate the atoms of meaning in actual lexical items , the latter atoms of meaning considered from the point of view of the overall structure of the language in abstraction . Thus , a particular word-meaning may be said to be the sum of a number of semantic components ; and the semantic structure of a whole language may be said to be a patterned network of semantic features . A component will be viewed as a value ' of a feature : for example , the structure of language contains the feature ANIMATE , and a particular lexical item will , when relevant , be marked with one of the two available values of that feature , the value +ArIIMATE or ? ANIMATE . The character of semantic features and components can best be shown by some examples . Compare the following lists of words : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 contrast with all the others in 20 ? 3 . One way of expressing the distinction would be to say that all the words in 20 ? 3 denote physical objects , whereas those in 19 concern abstractions . But we have determined to avoid that kind of explanation , involving as it does referential considerations . Instead , we might say that the words in 19 contain the component ABSTRACT , the rest CONCRETE . However , it seems that 19 and 20 ? 3 are contrasted in respect of a single feature ( not , by one component in 19 and another in 20-3 ) , and so it may be misleading to employ two separate words to capture this contrast . Accordingly , we will assign plus and minus values to one feature , marking every lexical item in 20 ? 3 +CONCRETE , those in 19 ? CONCRETE . This +/- notation is not simply a terminological economy , but , as we shall see , recognizes the fact that binariness of opposition is an important principle in semantic structure . ( In fact , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , and so the +/- feature notation will be found in the chapters on syntax and on phonology , too . ) Now setting aside 19 , we see that the lexical items in 20 differ from all of those in 21 ? 3 : they must be marked ? ORGANIC , all the items in 21 ? 3 containing the plus value + ORGANIC . Then the f ORGANIC set breaks down into ? ANIMATE ( 21 ) versus + ANIMATE ( 22 , 23 ) . ( A rival analysis would ignore the dimension + ORGANIC and label both 20 and 21 ? ANIMATE , contrasting with the + ANIMATE 22 , 23 . But this is evidently an insensitive oversimplification , failing to acknowledge a crucial intuitive difference between 20 and 21 , and not noticing the close relationship between 21 and 22 ? 3 which is dramatized by such difficult borderline cases as bug , amoeba , chrysalis . ) Next , 22 and 23 obviously divide on the feature ? HUMAN , 23 taking plus value , 22 minus . The whole network of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Invoking only four semantic features , we can reveal a lot of information about the semantic contrasts found in 19 ? 23 ( and many more lexical items which could be added to those lists ) . However , there is still a lot of semantic information which needs to be formalized . Let us look again at 23 , which is repeated here , with additions , as 24 : Table All are + HUMAN , but the set displays systematic internal differentiations . ( An additional complicating factor which I will not discuss here is that some of the terms are available in ? HUMAN 57 usages : our cousins the apes , baby panda , etc . ) Of the several new features necessitated by this set , we will notice only ? MALE and ? ADULT , which yield the following arrangements : Tablev Note that some doubtful cases inevitably arise . I do not know whether a foreman must be a man ? are lady foremen called super-visors or some other distinctive term ? Chairmen , on the other hand , may be male or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ( e.g. ) pretend parliaments . The query on student in relation to ? ADULT does not reflect the possibility of disagreement through political prejudice , uncertainty over the legal age of majority , or any other extrinsic questions of that kind : it is a query about linguistic usage . American schoolchildren are called students , while in British usage the term is reserved for those engaged in higher education . For the British meaning , we would mark the term ? ADULT , whereas the American sense would be unmarked for + ADULT and would therefore have a semantic structure like the similarly unmarked cousin , daughter , brother , aunt , nephew . ( The biological facts that aunts are often mature and nephews usually juvenile do not 58 Words and their components impinge on the semantic descriptions of these words . ) Notice that some of these words are unspecified in respect of the + MALE feature : cousin , student , politician , chairman . These lexical items are not intrinsically either + MALE or ? MALE , even though any objects designated by them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the independence of semantic and extra-linguistic facts . Our new features do not fit neatly into the diagram given for the first four . They apply to both 22 and 23 , so the diagram would have to duplicate branches uneconomically at the lower end . Moreover , ? ADULT and ? MALE are logically independent of each other ? for instance , the first applies to some items in 21 ( cf. sapling , bud , seedling ) but the second , as far as I know , does not . It is not clear how the diagram could be modified to accommodate these new facts : is the primary division of humans governed by sex or by age ? Even greater classificatory problems arise as more features are added ? as they must be . Although some features , particularly the very general ones first illustrated here , are logically related , it seems that the majority are not ; or at least , that any single lexical item is likely to contain components which are not logically linked . This observation leads us to view the lexical structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features linked in sub-sets , but the subsets not necessarily joined together in one overall network . Then each individual lexical item can be regarded as a bundle ' of components , each component being a particular value of some general semantic feature ; the presence of each individual components linking the item to a particular system of features ; and various components in the bundle relating the item to other lexical items , and hence securing its participation in different lexical sets . Moreover , the kind of features which relate lexical items componentially will determine the kinds of sense-relations holding among the members of lexical sets . The branching diagram ( Figure 3 ) , which is , as we have seen , too demanding logically , professing a neat hierarchy which can not be maintained in the face of the facts of cross-classification , may conveniently be replaced by a distinctive-feature table ( see Table 1 , p. 60 ) . The terms in small capitals represent semantic features ( not real words ) ; the words along the top are lexical items . Where a feature is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as + or ? , or ? if either value may obtain . Where a feature is irrelevant , the box is left empty . The semantic components of a particular lexical item are simply the list or bundle ' below the item in question . The idea of a lexical item as a bundle ' of semantic components ? values of features ? leads naturally to a mode of representation ? a 59 format for dictionary entries . We can simply list the components within square brackets : 60 Words and their components The symbol . . . Fn at the end of each lexical entry means and , in addition , all other components which are necessary to identify the lexical item , down to the nth component ' . Obviously , many more components must be listed to make an adequate lexical entry . For instance , we need a component to distinguish the meaning of grandmother from that of woman ; another one to differentiate nephew from uncle , since both of them , with the minimal compo-nential apparatus we have at our disposal so far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component showing exactly what kind of a familial relationship is indicated by cousin . It is not currently known how detailed this componential analysis might become , how far we might have to go in proposing features of very narrow , perhaps even unique , application . It is clear , though , that a dictionary entry is more schematic than a descriptive article in an encyclopaedia : we can know the meaning of the word elephant without knowing everything about the anatomy , feeding habits and reproductive mechanism of its potential referents . One guess about the number of components necessary to define a word , however , is that this will vary in inverse proportion to the generality of reference of the word concerned . Relatively general words like material , thing , animal , liquid probably contain few components ; more specific words such as clavichord , kangaroo , paperweight presumably require a greater number of components for their identification . This prediction rests on assumptions similar to those of logicians who distinguish the extension and intension of a term . A lexical item of inclusive referentiality ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small intension ) ; and vice versa . Before we leave the question of the number of components to be included in a lexical entry , we must notice that , whatever essential components are , through our ignorance , omitted from the repre-sentations 25 , nevertheless several too many are included . The com-ponent + HUMAN implies + ANIMATE , + ANIMATE implies + ORGANIC , + ORGANIC implies + CONCRETE ; so it is necessary to specify + HUMAN only . Wherever components in this sort of logical hierarchy of features occur in a lexical bundle , only the lowest in the hierarchy need be mentioned . This principle is known as a semantic redundancy rule : in this case , it reduces the first representation in 25 to 26 ( and the others similarly ) : Table Words and their components Since there is no logical hierarchy among the remaining components , no further reduction is possible . At the conclusion of this chapter I wish to present various senserelationships , or kinds of sense-relationships , between lexical items ; and we will see that the componential specification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two interrelated aspects of semantic description . Before looking at the various kinds of sense-relation , I should allude to two further questions concerning the status and nature of features and components . So far I have mentioned only features with +/ ? , either/or , value choices : +ANIMATE and - ANIMATE , etc . I think it is fair to say that , throughout structural and generative linguistics , linguists have been particularly conscious of binary oppositions in language ? IC analysis worked by progressive binary segmentation , and such dualities as Subject versus Predicate , Singular versus Plural , are indeed quite traditional . Linguists have tended to assume that binary structure is an important quality of language in general , of communication and even social structure in general . But there is no absolute reason to expect that all semantic features should have their values structured on a +/ ? choice . We might suspect that some features have multiple values . For example , multiple values might be needed to differentiate the meanings of whole numbers , or strictly closed sets such as the names of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. hot , warm , cold ) . My second point concerns a special kind of relational feature , the type of feature which governs the acceptability of certain combinations of words in sentences . For instance , mild is applied to atmospheric temperature , tepid and lukewarm to liquids ; in addition to establishing that all three words mean slightly warm ' , we must specify their different privileges of co-occurrence . Even more important is the need to specify which types of noun are required by which verbs : it is odder to say This stone is growing ' than This water is mild ' . Verbs exercise a stringent control over semantic structure elsewhere in a sentence ( e.g. the verb grow has a component which demands that its subject be a +ORGANnc noun ) . Equipped with the above explanations of the nature of semantic components and of lexical entries , we can proceed to explore certain sense-relationships ? links and contrasts between lexical items which determine the internal structure of lexical sets and the distinctions between lexical sets . It now appears that a semantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components in common : all the lists 19 ? 24 illustrate ( parts of ) semantic fields . Note , however , that semantic field ' is a term of variable scope , like some other linguistic terms ( e.g. dialect ' ) : a semantic field may be more or less inclusive . We can not , of course , declare that all the items in 19 ? 23 belong to one 62 Words and their components single semantic field , since 19 differs from 20 ? 3 at the level of the very general feature ? CONCRETE . But 20-3 could reasonably be said to form one lexical set , the set of words containing the component + CONCRETE , although this may be less convincing , certainly less useful , than some more specific and compact sets : Table In fact , semantic analysis is likely to be concerned with smaller fields still ? that is to say , with lexical sets the members of which share a large number of semantic components ( have great intension ) . Some interesting sub-fields of 20 might be Table Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relatedness of the items in these lists ( and of the distinctiveness of the lists one from another ) ; but these divisions are certainly formalizable in terms of the componential principles outlined above . As soon as we come down to relatively exclusive lexical sets like those illustrated in 27 ? 30 , we find that most lexical items belong to more than one lexical set . The explanation for this multiple membership is obvious : each lexical entry is a bundle of many components , and any one of these components , or more usually a set of components , may be selected as the criterial indicator of a semantic field . For instance , the word woman is included in list 23 because it contains the component + HUMAN . If we ignore + HUMAN the word falls into a set containing the following items , among others : Table The criterion for the set 31 is common possession of the bundle of components + ANIMATE , + ADULT , ? MALE ; if we reduce the intension by dropping + ADULT , the list can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princess , etc. , words which either specifically exclude + ADULT or do not demand it . ( The number of words 63 Words and their components which demand the combination ? MALE , ? ADULT or + MALE , - ADULT is quite small , since immature animals are rarely distinguished for sex , cf. cub , baby , piglet , chicken , etc . ) The list of words in 31 may be almost symmetrically matched by a complementary list 32 : Table The symmetry is not quite complete because man , fox and dog may be either specifically + MALE or unmarked for sex . In symmetrical usages , a particular kind of sense-relationship is exhibited : Table We must now consider the various kinds of sense-relationship found between particular lexical items ; here are some more pairs : Table The pair 34 is intended to illustrate the lexical relationship of synonymy or sameness of sense . Synonymous pairs of lexical items are notoriously difficult to find , and many linguists have denied that synonymy is a real characteristic of natural language . It is alleged that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that all contexts are unique ; that differences of tone , dialect and so on inevitably cause differences of meaning ( lass would occur in a different dialect situation , etc . ) . But a definition of synonymy is available , in terms of the above componential framework : two lexical items are synonymous if their lexical entries contain the same components and no distinct components . Furthermore , we have a reliable test for synonymy which depends on the presence of certain implicational relationships between sentences which differ only in that one has one of a pair of suspected synonyms as a constituent , the other the other : Table If 41 is true , then the truth of 42 can not be denied ; and vice versa . Symbolically , 41 42 and 42 41 ? the sentences imply each other 64 Words and their components reciprocally , and in such cases of bi-directional implication we may say that the sentences are synonymous and that therefore the lexical items which distinguish their surface structures are synonymous . I shall say no more about synonymy at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced by way of this concept will serve us further in distinguishing between the other kinds of sense-relationships exemplified in 35-40 . The pair 35 ( red : smooth ) provides an instance of mere difference of sense . Componentially the two items have virtually nothing in common ? they both communicate perceptual qualities , but in very different perceptual modes . Implicationally , the two statements X is red ' and X is smooth ' ( where X = X ) are compatible ( something may be both red and smooth ) , but the two items are not synonymous because they are not necessarily both applicable to one X. Now compare 36 ( red : green ) with 35 . If X is red , it can not be true that the same X is green ( and vice versa ) . Red and green are componentially incompatible : red not-green and green not-red . These two words are not merely different in sense , their senses are mutually exclusive . The same sense-relationship holds between the members of the set 29 ( plumber , electrician , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he can not be designated an electrician , at least if plumber ' is offered as a sufficient characterization of X ; and the same lexical incompatibility holds between any two members of the set 29 . Now there is one difference between 29 and the set of colour-terms from which red and green are taken , i.e. Table All the words in 29 are special instances of a general category for which there is a superordinate term : craftsman or , archaically , artisan . The set 43 does not have a superordinate . Coloured will not do , since it is possible to assert that X is e.g. brown or white but deny that it is coloured ; whereas you can not assert that X is a joiner and simultaneously deny that he is a craftsman , at least in the descriptive , non-evaluative sense of craftsman . Where a set of terms is provided with a superordinate , they are said to be co-hyponyms of that superordinate ; and a special implicational link holds between a superordinate and any one of its hyponyms. 37 ( red : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . If X is crimson , it is red ; but if X is red , it is not necessarily crimson ( it may be scarlet or vermilion , etc . ) . Implication works only one way : a hyponym implies its superordinate , but not the other way around . To repeat , if X is a joiner , it is implied that X is a craftsman ; but to say that X is a craftsman is not to commit oneself to the necessity of labelling him a wheelwright , or a french polisher , etc. 65 Words and their components The pair 38 ( wet : dry ) is more like 36 ( red : green ) than anything we have cited so far , but it differs from the examples discussed up to this point , including 36 , in that wet and dry are opposites ' semantically . So are the pairs 39 and 40 , but in each case the oppositeness ' is of a distinctive kind ; again , the distinctions appear in the implicational relationships between propositions containing the terms concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X is red ' implied X is not green ' , and X is green ' implied ' X is not red ' ; similarly with 38 X is dry ' implies X is not wet ' , while X is wet ' implies X is not dry ' . But additional implicational tests may be applied . Whereas ' X is not wet ' implies X is dry ' , and X is not dry ' implies X is wet ' , it is not the case that X is not red ' implies X is green ' ( it may be blue ) , nor does X is not green ' imply X is red ' ( it may be yellow ) . Wet/dry is one instance of a semantic relationship between two-term lexical sets which between them exhaust the descriptions which are available in a particular semantic field . Other examples are : well/ill ; married/single ; male/female ; full/empty ; on/off ; dead/alive ; broken/unbroken , etc . In all these cases , if the judgment is at all appropriate to an object , that object must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no intermediate terms . Such pairs exhibit the sense-relationship called complementarity ; it is quite different from difference of sense ' ( 35 ) , from incompatibility ( 29 , 36 ) in which the set has more than two members ? and , indeed , no natural limit to the number of members ? and from antonymy , a further kind of oppositeness ' which is exhibited by 39 ( tall/short ) and by many other such pairs . The implications which hold between the members of antonymous pairs are distinctive . If X is tall , he is not short ; but if he is not tall , it is not necessarily the case that he is short ; if he is not short , it does not follow that he is tall , although if he is short , he can not be described as tall . There are many other examples of antonymous pairs , mostly concerned with the measurement or evaluation of experiences : wide/narrow ; good/bad ; loud/ quiet ; hard/soft , etc . The characteristic of antonyms is that they are gradable : X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height , and so on . Moreover , the terms in antonymous pairs do not designate absolute values , but make implicit reference to a conventional norm for the class of objects to which they are applied . Thus sentences such as the often-cited 44 below are not self-contra-dictory : Table An elephant which is smaller than the size-norm for elephants is nevertheless larger than the size-norm for animals in general . ' This paraphrase brings out the fact that the terms of antonymous pairs are 66 Words and their components implicitly comparative ; those of complementaries are not ? a light switch may not be more or less on ' ; it must be either on ' or off ' . ( However , many complementaries may have special usages imposed on them in which they are made to serve as antonyms : in certain contexts we might want to say that X is more married ( more alive , etc. ) than Y ' . This fact does not undermine the criterion of non-gradability of complementaries : it means only that some pairs are either complementaries or antonyms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms which are primarily complementaries . ) Finally , the pair 40 ( buy : sell ) represents yet another kind of oppositeness ' : Table Buy and sell ( likewise give and receive , etc. ) are called converses . They are a very interesting class of opposites ' ? actually , it is rather misleading to regard them as opposites ' like tall and short , wet and dry , etc . Converses might well be thought of as being synonymous . Buy and sell actually contain the same elements ? the changing hands of goods and ( in the reverse direction ) of money , and two participants one of whom is recipient with respect to the money and parts with the goods , while the other parts with money and receives the goods . Typically , converses allow the description of a single event or process from two different angles , focusing on the participants in different ways . They are thus like the active ? passive correspondence , where the same verb is used in conjunction with a varying syntax ; cf. Table ( and consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of syntax signal a kind of semantic difference which we have not so far encountered , not a semantic difference between words but one involving the different roles of participants in an action . This aspect of meaning will be a major preoccupation in the next chapter , in which componential meaning will be included within a broader semantic framework as we consider the meanings of propositions , not just simple lexical items . It must be confessed that the current state of semantic research is more speculative than formal . Very few lexical sets have been explored carefully and in detail , and those which have been studied have usually been sets of words with self-evident and simple systemic connections : kinship terminologies , plant taxonomies , and so on . Once we stray outside these rigidly formalized bounds into the general vocabulary of a language , we are forced at the moment to offer semantic features 67 Words and their components of an ad hoc , and therefore sometimes less than plausible , character . Idiosyncratic features would be justifiable in a referential theory of meaning , where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tolerate components such as + LEFT HIND LEG OF A ZEBRA . A semantic theory which spawned such components would obviously be trivial and anarchic . The best protection against such arbitrariness is to propose wherever possible semantic features which ( a ) relate to each other in a systematic way ( e.g. the features ? ANIMATE , ? ORGANIC which are hierarchically related ) ; ( b ) allow lexical items to be associated in a systematic way ( e.g. by providing grounds for a formal conception of antonymy , complementarity , etc. ) ; ( c ) make available relationships which are discoverable in more than one language . The last of these criteria is particularly important . Contemporary semantic analysts assert that semantic features are abstract , reference-free , and universal : if they represent anything , they represent categories of conceptual disposition fundamental to the human mind . Thus we ought to be peculiarly attentive to whatever evidence issues from comparative language study that different speech-communities tend to structure their experience in comparable ways . Words and their components Analysis . Katz and Fodor 's Structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Katz , was a controversial but influential attempt to accommodate componential analysis within the **27;491;TOOLONG framework . See Weinreich 's critique , ' Explorations in semantic theory ' . My observations on the structure of lexical entries follow Chomsky 's in Aspects . More recently , Manfred Bierwisch has offered some excellent papers based on the Katz ? Chomsky model ; see , for instance , his chapter in Lyons , New Horizons . My account of sense-relationships draws heavily on the ideas of Lyons , to be found in his Structural Semantics and in chapters 9 and 10 of Theoretical Linguistics ? probably the clearest and most reliable introduction to the general tenets of semantic theory . Another stimulating work which explores componential relationships within the general framework of logical implications among propositions is Leech , Towards a Semantic Description of English . On p. 54 above ( discussing colour terms and perceptual distinctions ) I referred briefly to the linguistic relativity hypothesis , the theory that the structure of our language determines the perceptual and conceptual discriminations available to us . Since I will not take up this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ references . The theory is advanced by Benjamin Lee Whorf in several of his papers collected in Language , Thought , and Reality ; for some level-headed discussion , see Brown , Words and Things and Carroll , Language and Thought . Further reading An excellent collection of important papers which supplements my chapters 3 and 4 is Steinberg and Jakobovits , Semantics . See especially Howard Maclay 's Overview ' , pp. 157-82 , a historical account of recent linguistic theory ( with emphasis on semantics ) , which will supplement the latter part of chapter 2 , above . No mention is made in chapter 3 of traditional accounts of meaning-changes , for which see Breal , Semantics ; Stern , Meaning and Change of Meaning . Ogden and Richards , Meaning of Meaning , is worth reading not only for the semantic triangle ' but also for their discussions of the general nature of signs and of the terminological confusion surround-ing the term meaning ' . Stephen Ullmann 's Semantics is the most sensible modern discussion and adaptation of referential theory . Frege 's paper on Sinn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some other important papers on semantics by philosophers are to be found in Parkinson , Theory of Meaning ( which contains a clear and informative editor 's introduction ) . Componential analysis was initiated by anthropological linguists in the 1950s , but restricted to specialized , and obviously highly schematic , taxonomic lexical sets . An attempt to extend the principles to the study of less specialized vocabulary is Bendix , Componential 68 four Words within sentences I began chapter 3 by pointing out that although words , or lexical items ' , are of major importance in determining the semantic content of sentences ? as speakers feel them to be ? nevertheless they are not the sole determinants of the meaning of sentences . Other kinds of semantic factor collaborate with words in endowing sentences with meaning : further dimensions ' of meaning and also compositional processes , modes of relating words in sentences . By the end of chapter 3 we had seen that words are not even semantic primitives , not even for that kind of meaning ( ' sense ' ) which is given by words : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values of semantic features ; in turn , these semantic features map out the structure of the vocabulary as a whole . The technique of atomization ( componential analysis ) ignores the links between words and things , studying instead the relations between words and words ' ( p. 49 above ) . So far we have studied only a limited range of inter-word relationships . We now have to recognize that such relationships are found on two axes , which we shall call paradigmatic and syntagmatic or vertical ' and horizontal ' respectively . The previous chapter was concerned ostensibly with paradigmatic relations only : ties between lexical items seen in the context of the vocabulary as a whole , ignoring the links between words found on the horizontal plane in actual sentences . ( The term paradigm ' is almost equivalent to our lexical set ' ; the notion derives from syntax , and will be familiar to readers who have learnt foreign languages from formal printed grammars where the inflexional forms of noun and verb declensions and conjugations are set out in vertical paradigms on the page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i.e. syntagmatic , relation-70 Words within sentences ship , the horizontal link between lexical items in fully formed sentences . As we study syntagmatic forms of organization , however , we must remember that paradigmatic and syntagmatic facts are interdependent . This interdependence may be illustrated by the sentence-types which logicians call contradictory , tautologous and analytic . In each case we will see that the characterization as a certain kind of sentence depends on a particular ( syntagmatic ) coupling of lexical items which , outside the sentence , enjoy a particular componential ( hence paradigmatic ) relationship . For instance , the words nun and grandfather belong to the same lexical set , that defined by the component + HUMAN . This paradigmatic kinship is reflected in their free interchangeability in many contexts : Table But they are distinguished within the paradigm by containing components which are mutually exclusive values of the feature + MALE . So certain syntagmatic couplings produce contradictoriness : Table Now consider the words grandfather and man . Because they are not divided on any contradiction-producing feature , 50 below is a perfectly grammatical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tautologous : Table The predicate man adds nothing to the meaning of grandfather , since all the components of man ? + HUMAN , + MALE , + ADULT ? are already present in grandfather . These components are redundantly duplicated by the predication of man . But in 50 , predicating grandfather of man does not produce a tautology , since new components are added which are not intrinsically present in the subject man . The explanation of the syntagmatic difference between 50 and 51 , we see , has to take account of componential factors . Grandfather is a hyponym of man , so it seems that one form of tautology at least can be described as the predication of a superordinate term of one of its hyponyms ' . Notice that the definition makes combined reference to a paradigmatic relationship ( superordinate-hyponym ) and a syntagmatic structure ( predication ) . In fact , the definition needs to be made a bit more complicated than this . 52 , which would be tautologous by our definition , is not actually so : Table 71 Words within sentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without tautology . This is an analytic sentence : one which is self-evidently true by virtue of the meanings of the words as they are joined together in a particular syntagmatic fashion . An analytic sentence is one way of providing a definition ' of a hyponym term . ( Other kinds of sentences , which may or not be definitionally useful , are synthetically rather than analytically true , i.e. true by virtue of empirical fact rather than linguistic structure : Table Clearly the characterization of a tautology is deficient if it fails to capture the distinction between 51 and 52 . We can mend the definition by taking notice of further dimensions of linguistic structure which affect meaning and sentence-type . First , there is a difference of quantification between the grandfather of 51 and a grandfather of 52 . In the former a particular individual from the class of referents designated by grandfather is being talked about ; in the latter the proposition applies to any instance and all instances of grandfathers . Connected with this difference of quantification there is a difference of modality between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pp. 118 ? 21 below ) . 51 refers , presumably , to an actual state in the past ; but 52 is a generic proposition , a universal truth applicable to any time ( it would be misleading to consider the word is in 52 a simple marker of present tense ? in relation to universal quantification , it conveys much more complex information than that ) . Factors such as these have to be taken into account in describing the meanings of sentences , and in classifying them into types , as well as componential content and syntagmatic structural relationships such as predication . Analyticity , contradiction and tautology would be regarded normally as territory of the logician rather than the linguist . But they are certainly semantic properties of sentences , as well as logical properties of ill-formed propositions ? a judgment which is not intended to steal these properties from the logicians , but to suggest that logic and linguistics coincide in their interest in one aspect of semantic ordering . When we talk about sentences ' , we might most conveniently refer to the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linguist ; and ideally , I should have chosen some less inclusive term in the title of this chapter , which is concerned with only the semantic part of this complex . In the latter part of the chapter I will be treating syntagmatic patterns in semantics using a method which recalls the philosopher 's analysis in terms of predicates and arguments . Contemporary semantics ? in one of the most impressive recent schools ' , anyway ? suggests that the elementary semantic syntagms 72 Words within sentences may turn out to be the same as the logician 's propositions , or at least that propositions play a nuclear role in semantic structure . Additionally , researches such as those of Geoffrey Leech and John Lyons ( see p. 69 above ) demonstrate that logical considerations are relevant to determining certain types of sense-relationships between lexical items . For my immediate purpose , analyticity , contradiction and tautology serve to illustrate the intersection of the paradigmatic and syntagmatic axes in semantics , and to move us from the former to the latter : the horizontal ' dimension of semantic structure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lexical items is one topic in syntagmatic semantics , but we will look at other aspects of the linear structure at the semantic level and consider wider questions of meaningfulness and meaninglessness . On p. 62 above I mentioned that there are co-occurrence rules which specify the acceptability or non-acceptability of combinations of lexical items . I instanced the oddness of locutions such as This stone is growing ' and This water is mild ' , pointing out that the first is more deviant than the second , or deviant in a different way . I now return to this question for more detailed discussion . Examples 54 ? 62 , listed below , are either nonsensical or semantically odd to some lesser degree . This is not to say that they would not occur in real linguistic performance ? indeed , many of them exhibit semantic effects which are common in poetry , ironic discourse and some kinds of joke . When such sentences do occur ( where they are not simply mistakes ) , they are deliberate constructions whose rhetorical impact depends on the audience 's recognition of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oddity . Table I have included 54 ( taken from Weinreich ) for the sake of continuity with our earlier discussion . It is a contradiction , but the contradictoriness has a different kind of origin from that of 49 ( The nun was a grandfather ) . 49 is a contradictory assertion because the two nouns contain incompatible values of the same semantic feature . In the case of 54 , an absolute quality ( delicious ) is predicated of the subject ( the cale ) ; but the assertion is subverted by the quantifying adverb 73 Words within sentences slightly . A more dramatic example would be slightly frozen solid . Delicious , frozen , square , wooden , destroyed , etc. , share some semantic quality which makes them decline quantification or modification . Contrast salty , warm , rough , flexible , deformed , all of which can be modified by words such as quite , very , rather , slightly . It seems as though there is some regularity here which ought to be captured in a semantic description , by marking each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not it accepts quantification . If we were to look at more examples of adjectives , we would become increasingly impressed with the regularity of the semantic facts involved - and their complexity , for we would realize that there is not just one distinction relevant to this data , but several : note that tall accepts rather but not slightly ; that colour terms are ambiguous as between absolute and relative senses : red ought to be like delicious - something is either red or not - but we can also say very red , quite red , etc . As we bring more and more material to this set of distinctions , we realize that what at first appeared to be a peculiarity of delicious is the outcrop of a systematic regularity in the semantics of adjectives . My use of the ill-formed sequences 54-62 is meant to provoke the sort of reflections which I have briefly illustrated with 54 . We are to enquire into the conditions which make each particular example deviant , what changes would restore its well-formedness ; at the same time , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same observations pertain . Since the examples 54-62 illustrate a quite diversified range of problems and solutions , this procedure will allow us to survey several distinct facets of semantic structure . The fault with 55 ( John constructed ) is that the verb lacks an object : you can not just construct ( as you can sleep , laugh , die , etc. ) ; you must construct something . So the verb must contain , not only whatever components are needed to define its semantic content - construct as opposed to build , destroy , plan , etc. - but also a component which dictates that a noun phrase must follow . Such a component might be symbolized thus : NP The lowered dash ? ( not a minus sign ) indicates the place where the verb goes in a syntagm ; NP ' to the right of the dash symbolizes the necessity of a noun phrase after the verb . This notation is included in the lexical entry for every verb of the traditional category transitive ' . Its omission indicates intransitive ' ( sleep , etc. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be followed by objects or may have the object deleted : read , eat , etc. ; the lexical entry must contain the component NP and a further component indicating that the NP may be deleted - thus true intransitives such as sleep are dis-74 Words within sentences tinguished from pseudo-intransitives such as eat . ) The error in 56 ( The truck weighed a politician ) involves more complicated syntagmatic constraints . Weigh here means determine the weight of ' . We can tell that it has this meaning because the NP after the verb is not a unit of weight ; cf. the truck weighed three tons . Only humans can perform the action of weighing : thus the verb must contain , in addition to the components which specify its lexical meaning , a component which requires a particular kind of noun phrase as subject ? symbolically , withthe lowered dash meaningthe same as before , + HUMAN ? . The other meaning of weigh , have the weight of ' , tolerates a subject designating any kind of physical object ; both The truck weighed three tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the subject-specifying component , for this sense of the verb , is + CONCRETE . But in this case the object has to be specified exactly within the verb : UNIT OF WEIGHT . Now the verb in 57 ( This desk has eaten three mushrooms ) is less demanding than the first weigh ' , more so than the second : its subject must be animate , but can be either human ( boy ) or non-human ( dog ) . The selectional component for kind of subject incorporated in eat must be + ANIMATE . Similarly , the evidence of 58 ( Peter frightened a stone ) and of such sentences as Peter frightened a boy and Peter frightened a dog is that frighten contains an object-restricting component + ANIMATE . This component of course rules out not only 58 but 63 also : 63 . Peter frightened imagination where the object is ? CONCRETE and the selectional component + ANIMATE necessarily implies + CONCRETE . 59 ( Water does not mix ) and 60 ( The dog scattered ) exhibit failure of another kind of selectional link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses ( like collide , meet , unite , etc. ) demands a subject with two or more nouns denoting objects or entities engaged in some joint process or action entailing combined participation . ( Notice that negation of a proposition containing a combine-type ' verb which is anomalous conjoined with a single subject does not mend the anomaly. ) 60 ( The dog scattered ) is slightly different , but its fault falls under the same general kind of explanation as does that of 59 . Here , the verb scatter requires , not a conjunction of nouns acting , or being acted upon , in combination , but a noun phrase denoting a simple plurality of objects engaging in a multiparticipant action or process which does not , however , entail co-operative participation ( cf. gather , assemble , disperse , etc . ) . The interesting difference in the selectional requirements of the predicates in 59 and 60 from those of 56 ? 8 is this . In 56 ? 8 the semantic components of the verbs clash with those of specific nouns ( or , more accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of noun ) . If the noun alone is changed in the required way ( This boy has eaten three sandwiches , etc. ) , the sentence becomes acceptable . In 59 and 60 it is not the semantic character of the actual subject nouns which is at fault but the quantification imposed on the nouns . Quantification ( about which more will be said in the next chapter ) is the addition to nouns ? all nouns , compulsorily ? of non-lexical semantic components which modify their meaning in various ways . The nouns in the subjects of 51 and 52 ( the sentences about the grandfather p. 71 above ) were quantified differently : the first is understood as denoting a particular grandfather , the second as applying to all grandfathers . We may formalize this distinction by adding to the nouns the distinct components + DEFINITE and + UNIVERSAL respectively ( the grandfather in 51 being implicitly ? UNIVERSAL also ) . Another difference in quantification underlies the distinction between the ungrammatical 60 and its well-formed counterpart : 64 . The dogs scattered . Evidently the verb scatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is also + DEFINITE here , incidentally ) . The dog , or the grandfather , is marked ? PLURAL and therefore should not appear as subject of scatter . Now if we look at 59 ( Water does not mix ) again , we see that mix also demands a multiple subject ; but we remember that the objects designated by the subject are in a semantic relationship of a kind more intimate than is conveyed by the notion of plurality ' which is appropriate to 64 . In recognition of this , we might assign some component such as COMBINED to the noun(s) associated with mix . It appears from these data that the English language possesses a number system which is more complicated than appears on the surface . It is too early to do more than make tentative suggestions at this stage , but an analysis somewhat as follows seems called for : a noun must be either singular or plural ; if it is plural , its denotata are in either a combined ' or a ' simple plural ' ( which might be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not quite convey this arrangement . ) This quantificational difference between kinds of plural is relevant to interesting ambiguities of the type concealed beneath surface structures such as 65 . The students bought the new book which means either each of the students bought a copy of the book ' or the students clubbed together and bought one copy of the book between them ' . One final observation which emerges from this digression on quantification concerns the status of the term noun phrase ' ( NP ) which was introduced on p. 74 above . Noun ' is a lexical category , 76 Words within sentences or part-of-speech in traditional wording . We have now seen that nouns do not appear in sentences as mere lexical items , simple bundles assembled by selecting from the semantic components provided by the lexicon : in sentences , they are attended by non-lexical components also . This non-lexical element is obligatory : all nouns must be quantified . This is true even where no overt sign of quantification appears in surface structure ; for instance , the sub-ject of Man is mortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tacked on to it , is none the less quantified : this is a general statement about men ? all men and any man ' . In analysis the word would have to be assigned an appropriate component , or be accompanied by an additional abstract constituent , to make this meaning clear . A display such as the following would be suitable : This analysis makes it clear that , since man in 66 contains a quantificational element as well as a lexical element , it is an NP , not a simple N. Our final examples of deviant sentences in the list on p. 73 - 61 and 62 - will allow us to return our focus to verbs . I will repeat the sentences here for ease of reference : 61 . The dog shattered . 62 . John smashed a piece of paper . The verbs in these examples make very exacting demands on the nouns associated with them . Both convey the sense that a change of state from whole ' to destroyed ' is suffered by some physical thing . So a selectional component + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needed , for shatter and smash are relatively fussy about the things they apply to , in contrast to the more general verbs of destruction destroy and break . Only a rigid , brittle substance such as glass can shatter - certainly not a soft organic body like a dog . Thus the lexical entry for shatter must make reference to the kind of substance which is subject to that form of destruction . A similar criterion - the kind of material destroyed - is applicable in the componential representation of the verbs melt , burn , dissolve , crumble , etc . By contrast , the shape or style of construction of an object , rather than the material out of which it is 77 Words within sentences formed , seems to be criterial for the meaning of smash . Manifest three-dimensionality is called for : to suffer the fate of being smashed , an object must have reasonable extension in all three dimensions ( e.g. be cube-shaped ) , must be not very densely compacted ( e.g. not a solid block of metal ) , and perhaps be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To smash something is to deform its shape and upset the integration of its component parts . A piece of paper does not have characteristics which would permit its destruction or deformation to be described appropriately as being smashed ' . In particular , a piece of paper is very thin in relation to its other two measurements : sheet-like objects of this kind are more commonly described as torn , cut or ripped ( especially cloth ) . For smash and shatter , then , we must devise lexical entries which specify very precisely the kinds of objects which may suffer these processes . At the same time , noun specifications must include components which indicate in some considerable detail their shape , mode of construction , physical constituents and density . Readers may imagine just how various the demands of these change of state verbs are , and what corresponding precision is required in the lexical entries for nouns , by working out informally the semantic expectations of the following assortment : 68. slice , crush , shred , flatten , splinter , fragment , crumple , bend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack . With examples of the kind listed in 68 we have come to consider semantic facts of a very delicate nature . It will be realized , I hope , that units of meaning can be characterized at different levels of generality : the selectional restrictions proposed in the last few pages have been very specific ; other components which are necessary to identify particular lexical items may be of more particular application still ; and at the other extreme , semantic components must be entertained which are very generally applicable , very inclusive . For instance , the list 68 can be regarded as a gathering of verbs with similar properties as well as a collection of items with distinctive , perhaps even idiosyncratic , characteristics , as they were first offered . What do they have in common ? I labelled them change of state ' verbs , and it is that kind of highly general semantic characterization which must now receive our attention . ( Note : the discussion which follows is more speculative than anything else in this book , since it reports , no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current controversy in theoretical linguistics . Also , it is heavily dependent on the ideas of Chafe , Fillmore and Lakoff ? ideas which are themselves admitted to be very tentative ? expounded in the works cited at the end of this chapter. ) 78 Words within sentences In the last few pages verbs have been increasingly the focus of attention . These items do seem to have a special status in semantic structure . For one thing , their senses seem to be determinable largely in terms of the nouns which are expected to accompany them : shatter is a mode of destruction which is suffered by objects made of rigid , brittle materials ' . In other words , the syntagmatic associations of verbs are more important to the sense of verbs than are their paradigmatic positions ; by contrast , the senses of nouns were discussed in chapter 3 from an almost exclusively paradigmatic perspective . The verb seems to be the really essential element in the semantic syntagm : we have sentences ( e.g. imperatives ) consisting of a verb only ? Go ! , March ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noun by itself would seem very odd indeed . Another interesting pointer to the centrality of verbs is that they are inflected for aspects of meaning which seem to concern the sentence as a whole , not just its verb : for instance , 69 below is apprehended as a whole statement about past time ; it would be ridiculous to assert that only the verb is past ' , the NPs not : 69 . I listened to the radio . The pastness ' of the proposition seems to radiate from the verb and take in the whole of the sentence . But the inflexional information in particular NPs is restricted to them alone , and is not a general property of the sentence , as is evident from the fact that two NPs in the same sentence can be quantified quite differently without contradiction : 70 . Many children have profited from this course . Finally , verbs seem to exercise a considerable influence over our interpretation of the nouns which occur with them . Suppose we were asked to make some sort of sense of the anomalous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search for a metaphorical meaning of shatter which might be appropriate to dogs , but would rather devise a meaning for the dog which would allow the utterance to be interpreted : a model dog made out of china , a dog in a Tom and Jerry cartoon . More serious evidence for the influence of verbs on our interpretation of sentences comes from sentence-pairs such as the following : 71 . He 's reviewing the book . 72 . He 's writing the book . We understand from 71 that the book exists ; from 72 that it still has to come into existence . Traditional grammatical theory was conscious of this difference and explained it by positing two different kinds of 79 Words within sentences syntactic object manifested in what was only superficially the same phrase ( the book ) ; but it seems more true to the linguistic facts to attribute the difference to expectations controlled by the verbs . That which is being reviewed is reasonably expected to exist , whereas that which is being written can not be construed as yet existing . The above examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verb ' further . The remarks on the full sentence 71 apply equally to the phrase his review of the book . Since review here is , in part-ofspeech terminology , a noun ' , not a verb ' , it seems that my comments on the semantic status of verbs ' in sentences do not , strictly speaking , apply to verbs as such : in fact , they concern abstract , very inclusive , semantic units which are most typically , but not inevitably , realized in surface structure as verbs . These deep structure units are often called predicates or predicators . The term predicate ' has been used a number of times above ; at this stage we must try to develop its precision in order to indicate a crucial concept in our development of semantic theory . The term predicate ' is used in both linguistics and philosophy , and in both disciplines it appears in two distinct senses . First , it is applied to the whole of a simple sentence except the left-most NP : 73 . The three terrorists hi jacked the airliner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbal ' part of a sentence only : 74 . The children broke the window . ( My definitions are phrased to apply to English , of course ; details need to be changed for other languages , but the principle can be preserved . ) In recent linguistics it is coming to be realized that semantic analysis is more revealing if it builds on the second use of the term . The fact that the object ( the airliner , the window ) is more closely linked to the verb than is the subject lends support to the first analysis ; this closeness is reflected in sentences like 75 . The three terrorists did ( in reply to a question who hi jacked the airliner ? ) where did replaces the whole of the verb-object sequence , not just the verb . But we can quite properly claim that predicate-phrases such as hi jacked the airliner are constructed on the basis of simple predicates serving as nuclei . Every sentence communicates a state of affairs in which a set of objects , or concepts , are found in a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in a particular location ( The book is on the table ) ; an event may be said to take place at a certain time ( The 80 Words within sentences demonstration occurs at eleven o'clock ) ; one person may do something to another ( Bill kicked Peter ) ; something may undergo a change of state ( The flowers wilted ) ; and so on . It is predicates which are responsible for delineating the various relationships which obtain between objects or between concepts ? these objects and concepts being symbolized by the nouns in a sentence , of course . So we can propose a classification of predicates according to the kinds of relationships that they impose on the nouns which may be syntagmatically linked to them . In a formal grammar this classification would be expressed in terms of components included within the lexical entries for individual predicates ; but since the analysis is bound to be very tentative , in our present state of semantic knowledge , I shall not suggest components here , but merely mention some informal categories of predicate . Some predicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 76 . John is tall . 77 . This coat is dry . 78 . Peter was weak . 79 . The house smells . The stative character of these predicates can be confirmed by submitting them to certain transformational tests . They do not take the imperative mood ( *Be dry ! ) ; they are not appropriate answers to questions of the form What did X do ? or What happened to X ? ; in general they can not be turned into progressive aspect ( *John is being tall ) . The failure of the imperative , the progressive and the do-question tests reveals that these predicates do not communicate actions . Action predicates are a separate class : 80 . She laughed . 81 . The children were being aggressive . 82 . The animals scattered . The predicates in all the above three sentences pass the imperative , progressive and do-question tests ? including 81 , underlining the point that the verb is not the only word-class which can function as a predicate . But , like 76-9 , these sentences fail the test which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of predicate , indicating processes , fulfils this criterion : 83 . John became tall . 84 . The coat dried . 85 . The road widened . 86 . Churchill died . 81 Words within sentences Notice that each state predicate has a process corresponding to it . This correspondence is manifested in double service by the same lexical item ( dryldry ) or in an adjective paired with the same lexical item plus a process-forming suffix ( wide widen ) or in a pair consisting of an adjective and an adjective with become , grow or get ( tall/grow tall ) . The existence of the productive suffix - en in English ( and of similar suffixes such as - ize , - ate ) suggests that process predicates are regularly derived from states . This dependence of processes on states is quite understandable in semantic terms : logically , if a state S is possible , it must be necessary that objects should come to be in that state S ; so state ' implies process ' . The change-of-state ' verbs discussed above can now be seen as process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being shattered ' , and so forth . Clearly processes and states are incompatible , in the sense that an object X can not simultaneously be in a state S and coming to be in that state : they are mutually exclusive semantic components of predicates . Similarly , X can be simultaneously in a state S and perform an action A only if S and A are indicated by distinct , coordinated , predicates ? and even so the resultant sentence suggests a succession rather than a co-presence of statements : 87 . John was afraid and ran . To my knowledge , there is no single predicate which can at one and the same time contain the components which signal actions and states . However , action and process may co-exist in the same predicate , as is witnessed by the following sentences : 88 . John shattered the mirror . 89 . I dried my hair . 90 . The Senate rejected the proposal . In each of these sentences , the predicate is an action in respect to the first noun , a process in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror undergoes a process ( i.e. comes into a certain state ) . The type of predicate illustrated in 88 ? 90 may be dubbed process-action. - 'Now consider the following sentences ( as before , the asterisk indicates ungrammaticalness ) : 91 . The window broke . 92 . John broke the window . 93 . The window was broken . 94. *John broke . ( i.e. non-metaphorically ) 91 shows the predicate break as a process ; in 92 it is a processaction. 93 is ambiguous : it either indicates a state ( cf. the broken window ) or a process-action ( cf. The window was broken by John ) 82 Words within sentences in the surface structure realization of which the noun phrase designating the instigator of the action has been deleted or is simply not specified . Finally , 94 ? which is intended to be viewed as a sentence like John laughed , not like The window broke ? is ungrammatical and thus demonstrates that break can not be an action . The most economical way of displaying these facts is to postulate the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ componential representation all the permissible alternative kinds of predicate of which it may be the exponent . ( A convention for symbolizing alternativity of components must be added to those introduced on p. 60 above . ) The lexical item will be prohibited from serving as an action predicate because no action ' component appears in its semantic representation . Note that this omission of any mention of action ' provides a much neater and more revealing explanation for the ungrammaticalness of 55 ( *John constructed ) than does the preliminary proposal advanced on p. 74 above : saying that construct must be followed by an NP tells us nothing about the meaning of the word ; characterizing it as a process-action and not a pure action tells us a lot . Construct may also be a state ( The house was constructed ) , but unlike break , not a process ( *The house constructed ) . The analysis of predicate types is only just beginning , and doubtless needs to be considerably refined . Additional types may emerge : for instance , Chafe has proposed the types state-ambient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hot and It 's raining respectively . Probably some of the categories are too coarse ? for instance , actions may be distinguished , as the philosopher Kenny has suggested , as performances ' and activities ' . But even if the details of the analysis sketched above turn out eventually to need considerable overhaul , the semantic principles upon which it is based seem broadly acceptable and likely to survive further testing . We now turn from predicates to the nouns associated with them . When nouns occur in sentences , they carry not only their lexical meanings as provided by the lexicon , but also structural meanings derived from the functions they perform in sentences . Traditional grammatical terminology recognizes this fact in words like subject , object , indirect object . John in 92 is the subject , the window the object : 92 . John broke the window . In describing English these structural notions are usually applied in accordance with the positions occupied by NPs in the left-to-right ordering of sentences . As a consequence of this procedure , the window must be called subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences 95 . The window was broken by John . 91 . The window broke . If we compare 92 and 95 , we see that they have the same , or virtually the same , meaning . This being so , the concept subject ' ? applied as it is in radically different ways to 92 and 95 ? seems to be a very weak , uninformative notion from a semantic point of view . This difficulty was recognized by the **27;520;TOOLONG grammarians , who suggested a way out of it by a distinction between subject in surface structure ' and subject in deep structure ' ( a more traditional wording is grammatical subject ' and logical subject ' ) . John is deep structure subject as well as surface structure subject in 92 ; it is still deep structure subject in 95 , but the window is subject in surface structure . The value of this distinction is that it allows us to show that John is in the same semantic relationship to break in both sentences . However , the notion deep structure subject ' remains semantically relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surface subject of break , as John is in 92 . But , knowing what we do about the nature of break as a processaction predicate , we must realize that John and the window relate to break in two quite different ways , and the distinction is obscured by any such common label as deep structure subject ' . In both 92 and 95 the window is affected by a process , and John is responsible for the initiation of the process . We are entitled to attribute different semantic functions to John and the window , despite the syntagmatic appearances of 91 and 92 . These functions must be defined quite independently of syntactic order , of course , so that they may hold for 95 as well as 92 . We will say that John is agent and the window is patient ; and that agent ' and patient ' are examples of semantic roles ( or cases ) . Subject ' , object ' , indirect object ' and the like are now reserved for purely syntactic use ; that is to say , for labelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface structure . When they are invoked again in this book , they are intended to have no semantic force . To return to agents and patients ; here are some examples , with agents italicized , patients printed bold : 96 . He has visited Spain . 97 . Peter laughed . 98 . Peter is tall . 99 . Plants grow quickly . 100 . These apples were cultivated by small farmers . 101 . Organic things die . 102 . Stones are hard . 84 Words within sentences Roles are of course not shown in the lexical entries for nouns : they are functions which nouns assume only in sentences . Furthermore , roles are to some extent independent of componential character ? John ' can act , or he can be acted upon so as to change in state . Either a stone ' or a dog ' can be in a state ( and hence subject to a state-changing process ) . But there are some restrictions , the most important of which is that only a noun containing the component + ANIMATE can serve as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common type of metaphor , personification : 103 . The clock laughed . 104 . Faith triumphed . But how do we characterize perfectly well-formed sentences such as the following ? 105 . A wrench loosened the nut . 106 . A cricket ball smashed the window . 107 . The wind blew down the tree . 108 . An explosion wrecked the factory . In each case the right-hand NP is patient , and in each case the leftmost NP fails the test for agent , since wrench , cricket ball , etc. are all ? ANIMATE . No predicate can have more than one patient , except in the case of conjoined patients ( John and Mary were ill ) . So the lefthand NPs must perform some role or roles additional to the two identified so far . A wrench and a cricket ball are in fact both instances of the role instrument . In 109 below we have all three of the roles identified so far ? in left-to-right order , agent , patient and instrument : 109 . The plumber loosened the nut with a wrench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument , at least in sentences where an agent also is syntactically present , as 109 ; where no agent is identified , the instrument NP is moved to the beginning of the sentence and its attendant preposition is lost . This reordering and deletion , exhibited in 105 and 106 , is a transformational ( syntactic ) operation . I mention it here because it is essential that we understand the nature of the absent ' role in 105 and 106 . Though missing from surface structure , the role agent ' may be conceptually present ? understood ' in the same way that you is understood in imperatives . It is implausible that a wrench should loosen a nut without the control of some agent ; so we may say that the role agent ' is conceptually necessary , and implicit , but unspecified as to lexical content . I must admit that this analysis rests upon 85 Words within sentences a merely plausible construal of 105 ; but since 105 can undoubtedly be construed in this way , we need to allow for conceptually present but syntactically unexpressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probability of discourses such as 110 and the improbability , even anomalousness , of 111 : 110 . The plumber struggled for hours , and in the end a wrench loosened the nut . 111 . A wrench loosened the nut , but no one wielded the wrench. 107 and 108 , which look so similar to 105 and 106 , have very different semantic structures from that pair . The NPs the wind and an explosion are not instruments ( one might expect them not to be , since they are ? CONCRETE ) . There are no non-metaphorical sentences corresponding to 109 ; both 112 and 113 below are odd : 112 . X blew down the tree with the wind . 113 . X used an explosion to wreck the factory . Discounting such poetic explanations as God used the wind to blow down the tree ' , we must recognize that the wind and an explosion are more like agents than instruments , despite the fact that they do not contain + ANIMATE . Yet 107 differs intuitively from , for instance 92 ( John broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say simply that the wind is an agent in just the same way as John is , i.e. to drop the requirement + ANIMATE for agents . Presumably some special arrangement has to be proposed under which a certain sub-category of inanimate nouns can be employed as agents : I shall not attempt to pinpoint that sub-class here , although the general requirements seem clear enough ? the sub-class of nouns concerned probably consists of members all of which denote phenomena which are felt to have some intrinsic , independent force ' : thunder , gravity , electricity , the sea , magnetism , fire , etc . It would be hazardous to try to guess the precise componential factor which makes these nouns distinctive , however . Linguists discussing meaning from the point of view adopted in this book have already distinguished more roles ? and detected more problems in their definitions ? than I have space to consider ; and I assume that many more will be proposed , and perhaps abandoned , during the next few years . I would like to mention four which are postulated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other contemporary semanticists such as Fillmore while at the same time remaining faithful to the intuitions embodied in traditional grammar : these he calls complement , location , beneficiary and experiencer. 86 Words within sentences Complements are nouns in object positions which are not patients ; contrast 92 , which has the semantic skeleton agent + processaction + patient ' , with 11.5 and 116 : 92 . John broke the window . 115 . The choir sang a chorus . 116 . The children were playing a complicated game . The objects in 115 , 116 have the same semantic function of completing ' , in the sense of narrowing down or specifying , the meanings of the predicates . Game is implicit in the meaning of the action play ( contrast the semantic independence of window and break ) and the object simply adds more information about the action of playing ' . Song ' is implied by the action predicate sing , so 117 below is semantically well-formed even without an object : 117 . The choir sang . A chorus ' merely attributes a species to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Note : the predicate eat , discussed on pp. 74 ? 5 above , might now be re-analysed as a completable verb like sing . ) States , as well as actions , may take complements ; the typical examples are predicates of measurement : 118 . This outfit costs $100.00. 119 . The car weighed a ton and a half . Note that completable state predicates , unlike actions ( cf. 117 ) , demand complements ; there are no well-formed sentences on the pattern 120. *The car weighed . The role location ' occurs in sentences such as the following : 121 . The choir occupied the stage . 122 . The book is on the table . 123 . They moved to their new house . The nouns which act as locations in these sentences are easy enough to identify , but in 122 and 123 a problem arises over the status of the predicates to which they relate . If we ask what is the predicate of 122T the readiest candidate is the word is . But this can not be so . Sentences like 124 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 122 , but the adjective is the predicate : 124 . The book is red . Examination of other uses of be ' and its inflected forms ( was , were , etc. ) will suggest that it has no real semantic function . It occurs in 87 Words within sentences sentences where for one reason or another there is no verb to which semantic units such as tense can be affixed , and it serves as a root to which such information can be affixed . For instance , when a verb is in progressive aspect the morpheme - ing is added to it as a suffix . Only one inflexion can be attached to a single verb ; we are not permitted to say *movinged or *moveding , so we employ a form of be to accommodate the past tense element : was moving . The case of 124 is similar : adjectives can not receive verbal inflexions . Interestingly , there are languages ( including Russian ) in which tense does not have to be shown in constructions of this type , and in these the adjective simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Applying these analogies to 122 , we see that there is no reason to suppose that is is the predicate : rather , it is present to signal tense and mood . It is much more likely that the predicate underlies the surface preposition on ? an analysis which should not be difficult to accept given the fact ( amply illustrated already ) that a predicate does not have to be a verb . On , in , under , near , etc. all have clearly distinguished meanings and presumably easily describable componential properties , and there is no powerful argument against granting them the status of predicates compulsorily attended by location nouns . According to this analysis , example 123 must contain two predicates ; that is to say , it is a complex sentence . The predicate move is a typical process-action : X moves , and his state changes in one respect ? he comes to be in a different place . The predicate to introduces the noun phrase which specifies the location he finds himself in as a result of moving . Just how the relationship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis is a difficult question , but in general this account feels right and entails no great departure from the semantic principles which so far have seemed to work satisfactorily . We look finally at two more roles which may be played by + ANIMATE nouns . Since animate beings interact with their environment in a multiplicity of different ways , it might be suspected that a corresponding richness of roles is available to nouns containing the animate component . In addition to agent and patient , at least two more seem to be necessary , called by Chafe beneficiary and experiencer . Experiencer ' is the role of a noun characterized as being in a certain mental disposition ' . It contrasts with patient as patient occurs in such sentences as the following : 124 . The book is red . 125 . The cat is short-haired . 126 . John is tall . In each of the above cases the state predicate attributes external 88 Words within sentences physical properties to a patient , which may be animate or not ; but in 127 and 128 psychological or emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 128 . John is clever . Experiencer may also contrast with agent , as in 129 and 131 ; in 130 and 132 the subjects are agents : 129 . John knew the answer . 130 . John learned the answer . 131 . The barman needed a drink . 132 . The barman mixed a drink . Know ' and need ' are not actions , learn ' and mix ' are : the distinction is reflected in the roles required of the subjects of these verbs . Finally , beneficiary is the role of an animate noun which possesses something , comes to possess something or has something inalienably as a part of itself ; it may be illustrated here without discussion : 133 . Harry agent sold Max beneficiary a desk patient . 134 . Harry beneficiary owns a Rolls-Royce patient . 135 . The president beneficiary received a threatening letter patient from the committee agent . 136 . Our cat beneficiary has no tail patient . The final example , incidentally , yet again illustrates the independence of referential and semantic considerations . No tail is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore entitled to play a role in sentences . The fact that it asserts the non-existence of a referent is immaterial to its linguistic analysis . We should now look at some general implications of the model of semantic structure sketched above . In outlining it , I have adopted a view which is , I think , now gaining wide support : that semantics is a level of linguistic structure which is independent of , and prior to , syntax . This separation of levels has in effect been required even since the very informal presentation of chapter 1 , and in this and the previous chapter I have tried to give it a progressively more formal expression . We have seen how the signals ' in language are in several senses arbitrary ' from the point of view of the meanings they are called upon to express , that the link between message and sound is indirect , conventionalized . The conventions alluded to here are syntactic conventions , for it is syntax which is responsible for processing semantic constructions , for transforming them into linear orderings of morphemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within sentences repeatedly called surface structures ' ? still abstract units , but units which can now be concretized as sounds ( or , mutatis mutandis , letters ) by the phonological component of the grammar . The indirectness and complexity of the syntactic passage between meanings and surface structures make the latter non-isomorphic with the former . What this means is that semantic structure is not reflected in surface structure by any simple one-to-one representation . In general , surface structure is a rather poor guide to meaning , and we have already had several instances of this . A very obvious example was sentence 6 ( p. 31 above ) , in which a single semantic unit , an indivisible predicate , was realized as the syntactically discontinuous verbal phrase put . . . down . Many other examples can be thought up very easily . In English the suffix -s affixed to nouns means plural ' ; attached to verbs , it means not plural ' . Many words have two or more ( synchronically ) unconnected senses : bank , wave , right , pound , crane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a semantic element command ' , but there is no sign of it on the surface . The past and present tenses of verbs like cut , hit , put are identical , as are the singular and plural forms of a few nouns : sheep , fish , etc . In addition to these , and many more , isolated evidences of the non-correspondence of the structure of messages and the form of signals , we have encountered hints of more general and perhaps systematic kinds of failure of surface structure to make manifest structure clearly and uniquely : I refer to the cases of ambiguity and synonymy . I have already touched on these processes several times ( see examples 6 and 13 ; 7 and 8 ; 9 and 10 ; 34 ; 41 and 42 ; 45 , 46 and 47 ; 65 and 93 ) . We may now look at ambiguity and synonymy from the point of view of the predicate and role model of semantic structure offered in this chapter . Considering ambiguity first , it seems that instances of surface structures which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is a variety of such constructions ( many more are given in the book by Langendoen cited at the end of this chapter ) : Table When 92 was first introduced ( p. 82 ) , interpretation ( a ) was assumed : John broke the window ( using a hammer , a stone , etc . ) . But ( b ) is possible : instead of the agent-permitting component + ANIMATE 90 Words within sentences being emphasized , the more general + CONCRETE is foregrounded ? John 's body broke the window , the agency being unspecified . Table Meaning ( a ) is the one which is perhaps more natural to 137 , because receive is felt to imply a beneficiary . But it does not demand that role , as ( b ) shows : receiving ' can be regarded as a formal action ( cf. the illegal act of receiving stolen property ) : here the clerk is pictured as , say , sitting in a rent office taking receipt of money . Table 138 is an example from Chafe , who intends it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ( b ) is also possible , as when one puts a finger against the point of a needle to test its sharpness . Table ( a ) is the more likely interpretation ? My weight was 160 pounds ' ; ( b ) attributes an action to I ' , weighing out quantities of some unspecified substance so that the resultant weight of the substance totalled 160 pounds . 139 , if accepted , is perhaps of particular interest because both roles are changed as well as the type of predicate. 137 and 138 are more typical : the predicate differs as between ( a ) and ( b ) , and one noun changes its role in consequence , the other remaining the same . In 92 the predicate type is the same in ( a ) and ( b ) , while one role varies ; the converse situation is found in 93 . The kinds of ambiguity , we see , are multiple . As a final ? and common ? representative , consider this more complicated example : 140 . The baby crawled under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the two semantic structures here , but the following paraphrases will make the point : ( a ) The baby performed the action of crawling and the action of crawling occurred under the table ' ; ( b ) The baby performed the action of crawling and the outcome of this action was that the baby came to be under the table . ' Ambiguity can be amply demonstrated . The converse situation , synonymy or paraphrase ? two surface structures for an identical semantic structure ? is rather more difficult to argue convincingly . 91 Words within sentences The general theoretical framework adopted in this book allows for the possibility . Our separation of semantic structure from the syntactic level which is responsible for the formation of surface structures permits both situations : the concealment of more than one meaning under the surface of one utterance , as in the examples just discussed ; and the manifestation of the same meaning in more than one utterance . The reality of the latter situation might be supported by such examples as the following : 6 . He put the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 141 . The cat killed a bird . A bird was killed by the cat . 142 . John opened the door with a key . John used a key to open the door . 143 . Tom sold a car to Peter . Peter was sold a car by Tom . Peter bought a car from Tom , A car was bought from Tom by Peter . 144 . We lost a daughter and gained a son . We gained a son and lost a daughter . 145 . Arthur , the plumber , fixed the leak . Arthur fixed the leak ? he 's the plumber . 146. ( a ) The garage is behind the house . ( b ) The house is in front of the garage . Some of these sentences are distinguished from their counterparts by differences in word-order only ; others display differences in the choice of lexical items ( 142 , 143 , 146 ) . The common factor throughout the list is that the paired or grouped sentences have the same truth-values : if one is true , then the truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faithful description of the state of affairs it concerns , then 146(b) can not be said to be false , and the reverse relationship holds too : 146(a) implies 146(b) and 146(b) implies 146(a) . Such a relationship does not obtain between , for instance , the sentences John is short ' and John is fat ' ? although both states may be appropriately predicated of John , the truth of one does not guarantee the truth of the other , since there is nothing in the language which allows us to predict the applicability of one description merely on the basis of knowing the truth of the other . The bilateral , or reciprocal , entailment which holds between 146(a) and ( b ) , and between all the other matched sentences above , 92 Words within sentences is the minimal condition for synonymy . Sentences which display it may be said to have the same cognitive content . Sameness of cognitive content is easy enough to demonstrate where pairs of sentences contain the same lexical items fulfilling the same roles , as 6/13 , 141 and 144 do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the two sentences concerned differ only in word-order and in minor morphological respects . But semantic theory must also be framed in such a way that certain kinds of lexical difference do not interfere with cognitive equivalence . The traditional sort of lexical synonyms ? large/big , house/home , twilight/dusk , baby/infant ? must be explained componentially , and also the converses of 143 ( buy/sell ) and 146 ( behind/in front of ) . The ordinary synonyms can be accounted for by showing that they have the same semantic components ; what is less obvious ? though on reflection perfectly reasonable ? is that converses too contain the same semantic components . This becomes clear as soon as we stop thinking of them , misleadingly , as ' opposites ' . The meaning of both buy and sell , for example , can be paraphrased somewhat as follows : 147 . Patient leaves the possession of agent and comes into the possession of beneficiary as a result of monetary transaction . ' Selection of the surface form buy or sell depends on a non-semantic transformational choice , choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Transformations , being post-semantic processes , do not change meaning ; and surface differences , such as the alternative spellings buy ' and sell ' , are not relevant to semantic interpretation . ) Linguists ? and literary critics ( particularly the American New Critics ) ? who dispute the idea of paraphrase claim that any change in expression involves a change of meaning ' . It would be said , for instance , that the meaning of twilight differs from that of dusk because the two words have different overtones ' , or because they are typically used in different contexts ; that 146(a) is a statement about the garage , 146(b) about the house ; that the variants of 143 differ in meaning because in each one different aspects of the process-action are picked out for emphasis ; and so on . It seems to me that such arguments depend on too inclusive a conception of meaning ' , which I would like to restrict to a compositional product of lexical content , predicate type and role functions , quantification , modality , tense , aspect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conventional and deeply rooted cultural feeling of the reality of style ' ? the feeling , long recognized in literary theory and in the rules for linguistic etiquette in society , that it is possible to say the same thing in different words ' , to find alternative expressions ' or forms ' 93 Words within sentences for the same content ' . People can , and do , provide paraphrases of sentences when required to do so , and agree that the paraphrase preserves the sense . There is , apparently , some very real dimension of semantic structure which can stay untouched by changes in expression , and this is the level which semantics as conceived in this and the previous chapter must seek to explicate . In restricting the scope of semantics in this way I am not , of course , seeking to deny that there are linguistically interesting differences to be pointed out among the members of paraphrase-sets ; I am simply arguing that these should not be regarded as differences of meaning , since so regarding them sets impossibly generous and vague goals for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are most important distinctions between the sentences in 143 ? distinctions of emphasis , subtle shades of difference between imputed degrees of activeness ' in the participants , interesting psycholinguistic consequences of the differences in order of presentation of the constituent parts of the proposition . These are expressive ' distinctions which we will be better off relating to transformational structure than to semantic structure . Footnote 94 Footnote 95 five Simple sentences One of the most frequently referred to parts of Leonard Bloomfield 's great book , Language , is his comment on the difficulty of semantic description : The statement of meanings is therefore the weak point in language-study , and will remain so until human knowledge advances very far beyond its present state ' ( p. 140 ) . Bloomfield 's followers not only accepted the validity of this judgment , but went further , attempting to devise a form of linguistic description which explicitly eschewed semantic distinctions , claiming to concentrate instead on structural ' patterns by which meaning was conveyed . As a result of the efforts of the American structuralists , meaning was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Phonology , syntax and morphology ( study of the internal structures of complex words ) progressed : syntax notably in the work of Chomsky and his disciples after 1957 , phonology continuously ( though in very different styles ) in the period from about 1930 . Semantics remained immature until the 1960s , not because it was waiting for the requisite advancement of human knowledge , but because linguistics had developed a style which was radically antagonistic to the study of meanings . In fact , the necessary principles for the development of structural semantics were available from at least the time of Saussure ; that they were not built upon was purely a result of various intellectual inhibitions ? distrust of abstract entities , of unobservable components ; erroneous belief that meaning depends on reference and thus that semantics demands extremely powerful observations in physical science , and so on . For such causes as these , my account of meaning in the previous two chapters has , in its insecurity , reflected the newness and instability of modern semantics . The present chapter and the following two are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syntax , and here we tread on much firmer soil . The distinction between syntax and semantics has already been touched on several times in this book . Meaning is abstract ; syntax is the level of linguistic structure which is responsible for its concretization . We have seen that the surface structure of an utterance is not a wholly accurate guide to its meaning , hence the need for an independent level of syntactic structure to be recognized , reflecting semantic structure in only an indirect way . For instance , 148 and 149 below have the same cognitive content , differing only in the contrasted modes of syntactic ordering : 148 . A knife cut the cake . 149 . The cake was cut with a knife . It seems reasonable to say that the same proposition is expressed in 148 and 149 , the differences between them concerning only the words chosen ( the insertion of was and with in 149 ) and the order of the words and phrases ( the cross-over ' of a knife and the cake between the two sentences ) . Granting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree that the differences between them are syntactic ( and , consequently , phonological , since a good part of pronunciation depends on syntax ) . In 148 the semantic role instrument ' is signalled syntactically by the position of the first NP ; in 149 this NP is in a different position , but its instrumentality is shown by the word with ; other syntactic expressions are available for this semantic function , e.g. the word use : 150 . A knife was used to cut the cake . The differences among 148 ? 50 are , then , syntactic differences : differences of words and differences of word-order , independent of meaning . They illustrate quite dramatically the fact that though syntax and semantics run parallel , they do not correspond exactly , and they provide a kind of illustration which helps us to a definition of syntax . Looking at another aspect of these sentences will help us still further . We noticed above ( p. 77 ) that every lexical item of the class noun ' , when it is put into a proposition , must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signify the number of referents designated by a noun , whether they are unique , specific , indefinite , universal , etc . Such components are , of course , just as abstract as the semantic units ( senses ) which underlie nouns themselves . When NPs are realized in syntactic surface structure , quantifiers are manifested by conventional words and morphemes in set positions . Number takes the shape of a suffix on the noun , typically -s for plural and , as in 148-50 , zero ' for singular . Additionally , 97 Simple sentences number has implications for the articles which occur before the nouns : the indicates either singular or plural , a or an singular only . The main function of articles is to signal facts about the universality , definiteness or indefiniteness of reference of nouns . From a syntactic point of view , articles always precede the noun in English , moving to the left if an adjective qualifies the noun : a sharp knife . All these facts about the manifestation and ordering of quantifiers are syntactic facts . There is no essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word placed before the noun ? it simply happens to work that way in English ; other languages do it other ways . ( The principal distinction between languages is syntactic , or , as we shall come to regard it , transformational . ) We may now attempt to refine our terminology somewhat . I have talked about lexical items ' , propositions ' , words ' , sentences ' . With the normal tolerance granted to chapter headings I used Words ' and Words within sentences ' very informally for chapters 3 and 4 . In fact , it is better to employ lexical item ' for the basic compositional unit , the bundle of components , in semantics , and proposition ' for the semantic construction built up in the manner sketched in chapter 4 ( note that a proposition ' is not necessarily an assertion or statement ; commands , questions , etc. also have propositional content and structure ) . Word ' and sentence ' can now be reserved for syntactic elements . In this way the parallel , but not quite isomorphic , levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paired terminology in which word ' almost approximates lexical item ' and sentence ' in many cases answers to proposition ' . Syntax then concerns the make-up of sentences in terms of words ; it is the study of sentence-structure , a study which must always remain conscious of the fact that sentences merely express propositions , that they are not the same as propositions . For further precision , we can restrict the concept sentence ' still more by introducing a third term , utterance . ' Proposition ' allows us to take a semantic view of a piece of language ; sentence ' encourages a syntactic perspective ; utterance ' treats a section of speech or writing as a mere piece of language ? any stretch of language between pauses : it carries no implications of structure . Utterances are physical , behavioural entities : people speak utterances and write them down . The sentence is a linguist 's construct ? people do not talk in sentences , for a sentence is what a linguist , engaged in syntactic analysis , imposes on utterances . Sentence ' is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than a physical or behavioural notion . I have suggested that syntax is the study of the ordering of elements in sentences ; and nothing said so far hints otherwise than that these 98 Simple sentences elements are words ? the units which are separated from each other by gaps in conventional orthography and which correspond fairly closely to lexical items in semantic parlance . Certainly , words do have a degree of special status in syntactic analysis , for a sentence may be represented as a linear , left-to-right , concatenation ( chaining together ' ) of words : Table The validity of the syntactic divisions marked by plus-signs can be verified by substituting other words , as in 152 , 153 , etc . : Table However , the same substitution test suggests that there are also syntactic units intermediate in size between word and sentence : Table The whole family is a unit capable of performing the same function as the syntactically indivisible unit we in 151 . Similarly , that we had arrived at the wrong house may be replaced by a single word , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combines to form one single syntactic whole : Table More evidence for the existence of sub-sentence syntagms larger than the word comes from our feelings about the ways of inserting divisions within sentences . Everyone who knows English would agree that , if 151 is to be divided into two parts , the cut comes between we and believed : Table Compare 157 , which shows that the sequence believed . . . house is not an arbitrary string of words : Table Furthermore , the right-hand part of 156 divides naturally into Table and further cuts may be made equally as naturally . Speakers of English will also agree that some segments are intuitively right while others are patently erroneous : compare had arrived , the wrong house 99 Simple sentences with the quite arbitrary strings of words at the , the wrong . The triviality of these segments may be checked by trying to substitute single words for them ; they are obviously not real constituents of the sentence . Constituent-structure analysis , which is the technical name for this segmentation procedure , has already been referred to in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes are revealed , and are shown to be nested within one another : Table Each pair of brackets encloses a proper constituent : so wrong house is shown to be a syntactic whole , and also we had arrived at the wrong house , etc. ; but not believed that we , at the wrong , etc . Typographi-cally , bracketing-diagrams of constituent-structure , such as 159 , are complicated and it is difficult to retrieve the relevant information from them ; tree-diagrams such as 160 and 161 below are much easier to read , and provide exactly the same information : ( The bold lower-case letters a-i in 161 are for ease of reference in the dis-cussion below ; they are not a standard convention in tree-diagrams . ) Tree-diagrams provide a vivid portrayal of one fact about syntax which is not obvious from the equivalent bracketed arrangement : that syntactic structure is hierarchical and not ( as pictured in 151 ? 3 ) purely linear . Each intersection in the tree ( called a node ) links two units into one single constituent . Starting from the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constituents of a syntactic unit i ; that in turn i and the are the constituents of h ; h and at together make up g ; g and f are the constituents of e ; and so on . The highest unit in the hierarchy , here designated a , is the sentence itself , which is ( by definition ) not a constituent of anything , and which includes and dominates all lower-order constituents . The British linguist , M. A. K. Halliday , has proposed that the syn-tactic hierarchy be recognized by a set of terms on a scale of rank . So sentence ' would be the highest-ranking unit , word ' a constituent of a lower rank . The term rank ' is useful since it permits us to avoid misleading size metaphors . It is unhelpful to call the sentence a larger ' unit than the word , for syntax , including sentences , is an abstraction : physical concepts such as size ' relate to the plane of 101 Simple sentences utterance . Taken literally , ways of talking about the hierarchy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bigger than a sentence : compare the word carboxymethylcellulose with the sentence Fire ! There are not as many ranks as there are nodes in a tree-diagram . Each rank is occupied by a constituent of a certain type , and it is clear that in , for example , 161 the same type is found more than once . For instance , h , the wrong house , is not a different kind of constituent from i , wrong house , but merely a more complex example of the same type . Five ranks are usually recognized : descending the scale , sentence , clause , phrase , word , morpheme . Morphemes are the ultimate constituents of sentences , indivisible linear segments of words . ( Note : not to be confused with the ultimate semantic elements , which are not segments at all but components ' in the sense given by chapter 3 . ) Words may consist of independent or free morphemes which are themselves capable of behaving as words ( black+ board , straw+berry ) or of a combination of free and bound morphemes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( drive + - er , un-+fold ) . Bound morphemes are often divided into inflexional ( -s in fires , - ed in herded ) and derivational ( - er in driver , - ee in employee ) ; inflexional morphemes mark the syntactic function of words , derivational morphemes form one word on the basis of another . It must be pointed out that , although the concept of the morpheme is useful for recognizing sub-word regularities of syntagmatic patterning , there are dangers and difficulties in the way of developing an all-embracing theory of morphological structure . The dangers concern the potential confusion of semantic and syntactic micro-structures , as mentioned before . The difficulties emerge when we attempt to subject some words to a complete morphological breakdown . What are we to say about awkward residues such as the - ceive of receive , deceive , conceive , etc. ? or about morphological alterations which entail phonetic changes which can not be expressed by separate segments ? man/men , mouse/mice , child/children ? Can we justify a zero ' morpheme , which we might propose as the inflexion for the plural of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of see ? American linguists who grappled with these puzzles seemed to find them insolubly perplexing or controversial . In this book , although the notion of the morpheme will be appealed to whenever clear-cut cases of sub-word structure need to be noticed , no assumption is made that all words can be decomposed neatly into morphemes ; hence morpheme ' is a marginal concept in the present grammatical model . Probably no more needs to be said about the rank word ' ; we may pass on to phrase , which is a word-like unit whose constituents are 102 Simple sentences themselves words . A phrase is not just any odd collection of words cut from a sentence at random ? not believed that we , at the wrong , etc. ; the qualification a word-like unit ' ensures that only proper constituents are characterized as phrases : the wrong house , etc . A phrase is a sequence of words which as a group fulfils a single structural function , as a single word might do . The substitution test proves useful here . We can replace large cats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hence large cats is a proper phrase ; but since no such replacement is available for cats like , that is not a phrase . Just as a phrase is a single entity from the point of view of its external syntactic relationships , it is also hierarchically structured internally : this fact is demonstrated in the diagram 161 above , where the phrases dominated by the nodes h and i both have regular branching structure . Each of them is built up layer by layer on the basis of the word house . There is , however , a typological distinction to be drawn between the two phrases at the wrong house and the wrong house ; though the first is an expansion ' of the second , the addition of the word at changes the function . The wrong house is a phrase of the sort which is often called endocentric : the phrase as a whole is of the same syntactic category ( here , noun ) as its centre or head ' , the word on which it is based ; this is not true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noun . This type is known as exocentric . Another example of an exocentric phrase would be at times ; of an endocentric phrase , three long books . Certain combinations of phrases make up the unit sentence : the minimal construction is a noun phrase followed by a predicate phrase , as in 162 : 162 . The lion has escaped . Why a sentence demands these minimum constituents should be obvious from the design for semantic structure outlined in chapter 4 : a sentence is the expression of a proposition , and a proposition puts a noun and a predicate into a certain semantic relationship . Extra phrases will be present if more roles are to be communicated ( The lion has escaped from the zoo ) ; the noun phrase may not be given syntactic expression , under certain circumstances , although it is nevertheless conceptually present or understood ' ( Escape ! ) . The predicate phrase , however , must be given expression : utterances such as Lion ! ( as a warning ) or The lion ( in reply to a question ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! is ? but rather as exceptional truncated versions , made comprehensible only by implicit reference to wider linguistic and/or situational context . The essential conjunction of a noun phrase and a predicate phrase defines the clause as well as the sentence . The term clause ' 103 Simple sentences appears in traditional syntactic description in recognition of the fact that many sentences ? indeed , most sentences ? consist of two or more sentence-like constituents . A simple sentence , such as 162 above , consists of one clause ; complex sentences , like 163 ? 8 below , consist of two or more clauses , which , as we can see , may be combined in a variety of ways : 163 . The lion has escaped and the zoo is very worried . 164 . John played the piano while Mary sang . 165 . This tile , which is cracked , needs replacing . 166 . The fact that you were drunk at the time makes no difference . 167 . The lion has escaped and is roaming the neighbourhood . 168 . Josephine and Alexander have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clauses each with its own noun-predicate structure can be detected . 167 and 168 show that parts of one clause can be deleted in complex sentences : the lion is present twice in the deep structure of 167 , but needs to be expressed only once , while in 168 the same comment applies to the predicate passed the examination . Chapter 7 is devoted entirely to the syntax of complex ? multiclause ? sentences . One further observation which may be added at this point is that many complex sentences are not so easy to detect on the surface as 163 ? 8. 169 and 170 are just two instances of complex deep structures heavily disguised by the transformational arrangements to which they have been subjected : 169 . A ferocious lion has escaped . 170 . Caruso 's singing enthralled the audience . 169 contains two predicates : ferocious and escape . The noun lion is implicitly present twice : once as agent , in relation to escape , and once as patient in relation to ferocious . ( Patient ' rather than ' experiences ' , probably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an observer 's experience , not the lion 's . ) In 170 singing is a predicate , as well as enthrall : it is a nominalized ' form , but a predicate none the less ; Caruso is its agent . A syntactic account of simple sentences must take care to exclude such examples from its domain . We will see , in the next chapter , how prenominal adjectives such as ferocious in 169 must be introduced transformationally by a particular kind of combining of two underlying propositions . ( It seems inappropriate to talk of clauses ' here . ) Remembering this caution concerning the deceptive character of many apparently simple sentences , we will now examine the syntactic structure of some typical elementary sentences associated with the 104 Simple sentences kinds of one-predicate semantic structures discussed in chapter 4 . Here are some actual sentences from that chapter , re-numbered for convenience of reference , supplemented by some new examples : 171 . She laughed . ( = 80 ) 172 . The house smells . ( = 79 ) 173 . The dogs scattered . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 91 ) 175 . John is tall . ( = 76 ) 176 . Peter was weak . ( = 78 ) 177 . The cat is fierce . ( = 127 ) 178 . John is clever . ( = 128 ) 179 . He 's reviewing the book . ( = 71 ) 180 . The children broke the window . ( = 74 ) 181 . A wrench loosened the nut . ( = 105 ) 182 . This outfit costs $100.00. ( = 118 ) 183 . The book is on the table . ( = 122 ) 184 . We were in the house . 185 . She 's at a dance . The sentences express a wide range of semantic structures ( readers may care to revise their knowledge of semantic structure at this point by checking this statement against the discussion in the previous chapter ) . They fall under only four syntactic classes , however : ( a ) 171 ? 4 , ( b ) 175 ? 8 , ( c ) 179 ? 82 and ( d ) 183 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constructions agent-action ' , patient-state ' , agent-action ' and patient-process ' in that order , but reduces to one syntactic syntagm : a noun phrase followed by a verb . ( On 171 , cf. p. 77 above where it is explained that what appears to be a lone noun in a sentence is always implicitly a noun phrase , since all nouns receive quantification ? she is definite , singular , etc . ) The common structure of these four sentences 171 ? 4 might be expressed in the formula 186 . NP + V. Group ( b ) , 175 ? 8 , is equally homogeneous syntactically despite semantic diversity , but the formula is different : 187 . NP + Adj . For ( c ) , 179 ? 82 , we may generalize the construction as 188 . NP+V+NP and ( d ) , 183 ? 5 , may be expressed as follows : 189 . NP + Prep + NP. 105 Simple sentences ( Notice the similarity of ( b ) and ( d ) : neither contains a V , so an appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry tense ; cf. pp. 87 ? 8 above . ) Several more formulae must be proposed to cover the full range of English simple sentence-types . For instance , there is the construction 190 . NP + V + NP + NP exemplified in John gave Mary some flowers . There is the instrumental construction with with : He opened the door with the key . Among others , there is a most important structure ? for simplicity 's sake not mentioned in chapter 4 ? in which an NP serves as a predi-cate : 191 . The widow was a teacher . 192 . Our dog is a terrier . These are state predicates ; processes can be expressed by forming a complex predicate with become : 193 . The widow became a teacher . 194 . John became a hippie . Since there is no good reason to assume a sequence of two separate predicates in 193 ? 4 , it would seem appropriate to treat become as a pseudo-verb , like is in 191 ? 2 ; then all four sentences can be represented in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 195 . NP+NP . Our six formulae 186 ? 90 , 195 comprise a primitive constituentstructure analysis of the main types of elementary English sentence . The grammar must now be refined so as to show the hierarchical relationships among the constituents ; this can be done in such a way as to relate the formulae to one another , also . Each formula has an NP on the left ; and English speakers , invited to divide a sentence into two parts , will agree on a primary cut between this NP and the rest of the sentence : 196 . She ? laughed . The house ? smells . John ? is tall . He ? ' s reviewing the book . This outfit ? costs $100.00 . John ? gave Mary some flowers . The remainder ' on the right of this cut is the predicate or has the predicate as its centre , so we may call it predicate-phrase , abbreviated PredP . Every sentence , at the most abstract level of description , 106 Simple sentences is an arrangement of an NP followed by a PredP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured in a conventional symbolic notation : 197 . S - ? NP + PredP . A sentence consists of a noun phrase followed by a predicatephrase . ' ( The notation 197 is the standard style employed in phrasestructure grammars of the type devised by Chomsky - see pp. 28-33 above . The single arrow - ? ' asserts that the element designated by the symbol on the left has as its constituents ' the elements symbolized by the letters on the right . A secondary meaning for the arrow symbol will be introduced below . ) Next , both the NP and the PredP are analysable into further constituents . We saw above ( p. 77 ) that an NP consists of a lexical item of the class noun ' and a quantifying ' element which in surface structure may be realized as , for example , an article ( the chair ) , a demonstrative ( this chair ) , or nothing ( John ) . The quantifying constituent is usually called a determiner , abbreviated Det . Thus the rule for the structure of NPs is 198 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the components of the element Det . We must now examine the constructions associated with the predicate phrase ; and it should be obvious that there is not just one of these , as there is for NP , but several . What is more , our formulae 186-90 , 195 not only ignore some kinds of PredP , but also omit mention of an obligatory constituent which supplies the inflexional information vital to predicates . This information is carried in surface structure by a great variety of words and morphemes : suffixes , as the - ed for past tense , - ing for progressive aspect and - en or - ed for perfect and for passive ; can , will , should , etc. , representing the various modal forms . In the very general representation of syntax that we are building up , all the meanings reflected in these fragments of words are gathered under one symbol , Aux ( not simply the auxiliary ' forms can , may , etc. , but verbal suffixes also , since all derive from the same complex of meanings ) . The meanings associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verb is , say , past tense , but complete statements are . But since these meanings are , syntactically , expressed by morphemes which are affixed to the verb , and by words which are juxtaposed with it , it seems preferable to introduce Aux by the syntactic rule for expanding PredP rather than by the rule ( 197 ) which expands the symbol S into its lexical constituents . So the following rule gives the structure of one type of PredP , that found in sentences 171-4 ( cf. formula 186 ) : 199 . PredP - ; Aux + V. 107 Simple sentences The following rules describe the other kinds of predicate-phrase : The symbols introduced by our elementary syntactic rules can now be added to tree-diagrams to provide an explicit picture of constituent structure ; 208 is an abstract representation of any of the sentences 179-82 . A more economical presentation which has the added advantage of showing the likeness between predicate-phrases is the display 204 below , in which braces indicate alternativity ; 204 is a conflation of the five rules just given : Notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their purpose is to acknowledge the fact of hierarchical structure within the predicate phrase , a fact not noticed by the representations 188 ? 90 . As VP and PrepP are symbols for sequences of segments , not single segments , their own internal structure must be shown by additional constituent-structure rules : ( Note : the lower line of 205 actually needs revision to show hierarchical structure in VPs with two NPs . The relevant example is John gave Mary some flowers or John gave some flowers to Mary . I am not sure which of the trees given in 207 would be appropriate , so have not chosen between them . 108 Table Alternatively , the syntax of a simple sentence can be described by attaching a derivation to it . A derivation is a sequence of lines , each in succession representing the structure of the sentence in finer detail . A line is derived from the preceding one by applying a phrasestructure rule to just one symbol at a time . We start with the grammar 's initial symbol ' S and rewrite ' it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule 197 ( hence the term rewriting rule ' : the arrow may be regarded as the rewriting symbol ' , an instruction to rewrite whatever is on its left as whatever is on its right ) , and so on down the sequence as follows : Table Each of the lines ( i ) ? ( vi ) adds more information about the syntax of the sentence ; they become progressively less general representations , approach surface structure more closely . 208 and 209 show only syntax . In a proper derivation semantic information would appear too . Let us see how this is arranged in a representation of sentence 180 , The children broke the window . The V and the Ns of this sentence are already , by application of a sequence of semantic rules , componentially specified , endowed with lexical meaning , predicate-type , role-types . The meanings selected under Det and Aux will have been chosen , too , and the whole complex mapped on to a syntactic structure which is a more detailed 109           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
