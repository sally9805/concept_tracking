Anne of the Thousand Days appears to have been made for one person : the Queen of England . Though it exhibits its royalty rampant on a field of anguish , the film provides a thoroughly upbeaten ending . Cannons resound as Queen Anne Boleyn is beheaded . Henry VIII hears the signal , puts spur to horse and gallops off " to Mistress Seymour 's house ! " All the while , the future Virgin Queen placidly wanders the palace gardens , toddling toward history . The monarchical fevers are burning out ; and England , booms the sound track , is ready for the high triumphs of Elizabeth Regina . <P> It is a story fit for the second Elizabeth , though it has perhaps one minor fault : the first two hours . In adapting Maxwell Anderson 's pretentious free-verse play , the film makers have resurrected cliches that have lain dormant for decades . There are " get-out-of-my-sight " scenes that have not been witnessed since Bette Davis hung up her spites . There are pseudo profundities that recall the worst of The Lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when I pray , God answers . " Even the costumes are exaggerated . Lest the audience miss the villainous character of Cardinal Wolsey ( Anthony Quayle ) , he is wrapped in a Satanic scarlet no vicar ever wore on earth . <P> Ironclad Chastity . As the autumnal Henry , Richard Burton is every other inch a king . In appearance he is as scruffy as a knave ; his justly celebrated voice is restricted to self-analytical lists : " I 'm bitter , I 'm envious , I 'm dangerous , I 'm malicious . " Quite . But regal ? Not quite . <P> Throughout the film , audiences may be reminded of a late-show favorite , The Private Life of Henry VIII , starring Charles Laughton rumbustiously chomping up silversides of beef and dialogue . It was a superior treatment of the same subject in every sense save one . As the current Anne Boleyn , Genevieve Bujold refuses to accept the facile role of the wronged woman . Starting as a beautiful child , she contrives to catch the conscience and the passion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monarch to pawn size , forces him to divorce Katherine of Spain and take her as his Queen . But , like Katherine , she is natally undone . England needs a future king . The old Queen produced stillborn princes . The new one gives birth to a live female and a dead male . Enraged , Henry VIII rigs charges of adultery against Anne and dooms her to the Tower of London and the headsman . <P> It would have been easy to play the spider ensnared by her own web , but Bujold knows better . In her " doleful prison , " she suddenly appears as the real Anne must have been : a clever child who grew in stature not in the brilliance of her court but in the shade of her executioner . The performance establishes the star , but not her setting . A great King may be enough to restore a country ; a noble Queen is insufficient to save a base film .                   @ @
