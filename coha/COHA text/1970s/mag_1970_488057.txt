Mr. Lopez is an international lawyer , with a degree from Harvard Law School . He is also the author of a novel , Afro-6 ( Dell Publishing ) , did the actual writing of Sam Houston Johnson 's My Brother Lyndon ( Cowles Book Co. ) , and contributes to a number of national magazines . It was nearly midnight , and the barrio strangely quiet , quiet with fear . I had just left the Carioca restaurant with a dozen tortillas de maiz in a paper bag . I - was lb " spending the night before the funeral at my mother 's house , and she 'd promised to cook my favorite ? breakfast of menudo con chile . The tortillas , naturally , were essential . Suddenly a police car screeched to a stop at the curb . Two cops jumped out and pushed me against the wall , frisking me from top to bottom with rough insolent hands . They said not a word , and neither did I. I was simply not macho ' enough to protest . ' A cop like these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chicano columnist for the Los Angeles Times , in the Silver Dollar cafe , and I was frankly afraid to cross them . They have also arrested about 300 Chicanos- since the police riot that erupted during the East Los Angeles peace rally . that Ruben was covering on the afternoon he was killed . I did n't want to be " prisoner 301 " ? and , having flown all the way from New York , I certainly ' did n't want to miss Ruben 's funeral . So I accepted the indignity of their frisk with a gut-souring meekness . This is all familiar stuff to anyone who has lived in a Chicano barrio . And when they yanked off my shoes and shook them upside-down , I clamped my mouth to hold back the ' sour saliva that I 'd like to spit in their faces . " What do you do ? " one of them asked . " I 'm a lawyer and a writer . " " Oh  --  one of those guys , " in a tone suggesting one ' of those smart-ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , one of these guardians of the peace grabbed it and quickly shuffled through the tortillas ' in an apparent search for marijuhna or heroin . Finding none , he gave them back . - Later on I threw the tortillas into a trash can  --  they must have had a hundred cop fingerprints on them . They let me go finally  --  a tribute to my meekness , to what I would rather call my old barrio wisdom . The pragmatism of fear . And in my confusion and resentment ( or was it again a sense of prudent resignation ? ) , I had not noticed their badge numbers . Nor would I be able to recognize their faces again . I 'm afraid all cops ' faces have begun to look alike to me . And that 's tragic , in a way , because two years ' ago I wrote to Mayor Lindsay and the New York Police Commissioner , commending a police officer who had been extremely kind ( fatherly kind ) to my 10-year-old daughter when she was injured near our apartment while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had taken her to a hospital and stayed by her side for five hours . So it 's not in me to be a cop hater . Just below Soto and Brooklyn Avenue , while searching vainly for a cab on those deserted streets , I saw a police helicopter swishing over me like a giant insect , its bright , harsh searchlights probing the dark alleys and back yards of the barrio . I wondered then if the police regard us Mexican-Americans as a community of barricaded criminals . The phrase came easily at that moment because that very afternoon the nines had quoted an expert as saying that the kind of missile that killed Ruben " should be used only against a barricaded criminal . " Gene Pember , a con- , sultant for the Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission , had told newsmen that the high-velocity tear-gas projectile that pierced Ruben 's skull should never be used for crowd control , that " the thing is like a young cannon , really . " Such missiles , he said , could go through a thick stucco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to penetrate a house or an object behind which a dangerous suspect has barricaded himself . But even then they should never be fired at a person . " The 10-inch ' missile that killed Salazar was fired by a sheriff 's deputy through an open doorway at a point-blank range of 15 feet . The deputy who fired that missile may not have , known it was Ruben Salazar he was shooting , but he certainly knew it was a Chicano . Yet , not once during the entire week following this obvious example of heedless slaughter would Sheriff Pitchess admit that his men might have been even - slightly negligent . Sam Houston Johnson once told me that his brother LBJ suffered from a profound inability to say " I 'm sorry " ? to admit any error , hoWever inconsequential . Certainly a tragic flaw in a'human being , and I wonder if the Los Angeles sheriff shares that affliction . Far from blaming any of his men , he keeps talking about " outside agitators . " Small wonder that my fellow Chicanos are willing to believe almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted its entire front page to blown-up photos from a community newspaper called La Raza , quoting at length from an article titled " The Murder of Ruben Salazar " ? they may have begun to entertain even that suspicion . Earlier that evening ( several hours before the cops frisked me ) I had attended a rally of Chicanos at the All Nations auditorium , ' where I heard their collectiverage and frustration  --  my own as well  --  burst from the throats of one speaker after another , the packed listeners periodically stamping their feet and raising clenched fists as a symbol of " Chicano Power . " The speeches were mostly in English , but occasionally resorted to a schizo-lingual amalgam of English and Spanish to stress a vital point . ( " Let 's show los linches placas that we 're menque no bastard cop nos puede chingar ! " ) Tough barrio language , most of it spoken with the bitterness of long years of resentment , some of it with a hushed , melancholy sense of bitter resignation . When Corky Gonzalez was introduced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " viva Chicano power " echoed from the walls , throbbing in my head , sending an expectant chill up my spine . But there was , no flaming rhetoric from the much loved leader of the Crusade for Justice  --  no call to arms , no threat of violence . There was instead an urgent plea for Chicano unity , for a grass-roots drive for political power , for a reclaiming of " the occupied territory of Azdan , " that portion of the United States that once belonged to Mexico . It sounded more like a psychic take-back than a real one . The muted anger in his voice was spiced with humorous irony when he told the crowd , " I was busted at the peace rally and charged with suspicion of robbery because I had $325 in my billfold . To the gabacho cops , I guess it 's awful damned suspicious for a Chicano to have that much bread . " Clearly moved by Corky 's mesmeric hold on the audience , Rene Anselmo ( an Anglo millionaire who owns three TV stations ) instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been arrested since the riot . By coincidence , Captain Ernest Medina  --  defendant in the My Lai massacre case  --  was in Los Angeles during that same , period , seeking donations for his defense from fellow Mexican-Americans . I doubt that he could have raised 2 ? from the people who heard Corky , though I 'm told that American Legionnaires in his home town think hiM a hero . - After the rally I went to the Carioca bar-restaurant to eat Mexican food . It was also a sentimental gesture . The last time I had seen Ruben Salazar we had come to thiS restaurant , mostly to hear the mariachi trio that entertains here . They had played our favorite Adelita. and Siete Leguas , songs of the Mexican Revolution that led us into a pleasant nostalgic mood . I had once written that my father was the only private in Pancho Villa 's army , and he was now claiming that his father was the only private , smiling in that gentle way he had , his eyes shining with impish enjoyment . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual conviction that each of our fathers was the only private in that famous rebel Division del forte ? Our conversation became serious after a while . Ruben was deeply concerned about the laggard pace of bilingual education programs for Chicano children in the early grades . Most educators know that everyone 's greatest , most intense period of learning is from birth to the age of 5 . For a Chicano that fast-paced , crucial learning is acquired in Spanish or in a " pocho " combination of Spanish and English . But the day he enters kindergarten ? a day of intense anxiety even for a child from the most secure Anglo environment  --  that learning tool is snatched away . He 's not permitted to speak the only language he knowk . So he sits in frustration , confusion and fright as the teacher and the " more advantaged " kids talk in alien sounds , making him feel dumb and lost . The experience is repeated hour after hour , day after day , until he 's ultimately defeated . There is no one more fragile than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure to school with him ; he has no chance of success , no possibility of the " reward and reinforcement " that child educators feel is indispensable . The high school dropout rate for Mexican-Americans ( 58 per cent in some Chicano ghettos  --  higher than the rate for black students ) is a belated symptom of the dropping out that begins on the first day of kindergarten . " Why ca n't they teach our Chicano kids in both Spanish and English ? " asked Ruben , fingering an empty glass . " If they could have genuine bilingual classes ? Spanish in the morning and English in the afternoon -- there would be some trace of comforting familiarity ' between school and their home . They , could feel successful in Spanish ; capable of learning . They would n't feel dumb , they would n't quit trying as they do now . With 0. - a gradual transition in kindergarten and the first two grades , English would be easier . " His convictions were an echo of educational theories developed by Dr. Jerome Bruner , director of Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghetto 4 youngsters often face insuperable linguistic And environ mental obstacles . Ordering another ' round of margaritas that evening , we talked of other problems that bedevil Chicano kids . ' ! ? - , Thinking of the kid-glove treatment used on the KennedyShriver cousins when they were arrested for possession of marijuana , we were both sure that a Chicano or black teen-ager-would haVe been summarily convicted and sent to a reformatory for at least six months . I told Ruben of my first encounter with the juvenile court system as a lawyer ( I 'd had several as a child ) . A Mexican-American woman had called my office in a state verging on hysteria . Her 13-year-old son  --  let 's call him Ramon Gomez -- had been picked up by THE NATION / Ouiiber 19 , 1970 the police and whisked off in a squad car , but no one at the local precinct station would tell her where he was . Within half an hour we were at the Hollenbeck station in East Los Angeles , and were informed that Ramon was n't there . No record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detention Home , where the desk captain said there was no booking on a Ramon Gomez . But as we were leaving , a young Chicano trustee told us that a boy answering Ramon 's description had been taken from the detention home to the Los Angeles General Hospital . " He had a bloody bandage on his face . " Checking the prison ward at the hospital , we learned two hours later that he 'd received treatment for a fractured nose and them been returned to the detention home . When we tried to see him at the so-called home , we were told he could n't have visitors  --  nor could I see him in my capacity as his attorney . Angered by this refusal ( any adult prisoner can see a lawyer ) , I went to a bail bondsman , who told me that kids were n't entitled to release on bail . Then I called several judges , who told me that they could n't order his release on a writ of habeas corpus because ' children were n't entitled to that constitutional right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 'd been accused of trying to break into a bubble-gum machine . " I put a penny in there and the gum did n't come out , so I was shaking it when the police came by . And when I tried to explain what happened , one of them slapped me . Then when I protested , they got me in the car , and one of ' them started punching my face with his closed fist , calling me a smart-aleck spick . That 's how my nose got busted . " The Kafkaesque nightmare ' continued the next day at Ramon 's hearing in juvenile court . The judge immediately informed me that I could n't act as his lawyer " because this is not a criminal proceeding . " " Then why are you treating him like a criminal ? " I asked . " Why has he been detained in that jail ? " " That 's not a jail , " ? he said rather testily . " It 's only , a detention home . " Paraphrasing Gertrude Stein , I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barred gates to keep those kids inside , - and a jail is a jail is a jail  --  no matter what name you give it . " But he still would n't let me appear as Ramon 's lawyer , so his mother and I just sat there watching the nightmare proceedings ' of that quick-justice cafeteria called a " court . " Not only were the juvenile defendants ( almost all of them black or Chicano ) denied lawyers ; they could n't face their accusers , they could n't cross-examine witnesses against them , they could n't object ' to rank hearsay testimony , they were n't protected by any of the normal rules of evidence . They were , in fact , unable to invoke any of the constitutional safegUards that are available to known gangsters . And when I asked the judge for a transcript of the , hearing after he had sentenced Ramon to six months in a reformatory , his mother pleaded with me not to appeal the case . " If we raise a big fuss , " she said , " they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'll be a marked man . We Chicanos do n't have a chance . " Ruben had a film of tears in his eyes when I told him about Ramon . " Como son pinches , " he said . " How can they be such bastards with little kids ? And think of all the other Ramons who 've been in the same bag . " Ramon Gomez must be 20 years old by now . He may have been one of the tight-mouthed militants in the angry crowd at the All Nations auditorium on the night before Ruben 's funeral , listening to one speaker comment on the tear-gassing of children at the peace rally , listening to the bitter irony in Corky Gonzalez 's voice . He 's heard , as most Chicanos have , that Corky is a marked man , that the FBI probably shadows him from one state to another as he goes from , campus to campus , from barrio to barrio , asking his brown brothers to join in common cause . Ramon knows from personal experience ( as do too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the juvenile court system , by those crime-breeding reformatories ) , knows with a sickening fear that the police may some day crowd in on Corky , and that tragic violence-may result . But quite aside'from his own not likely to be forgotten experience with the law , Ramon knows about inferior ghetto schools with indifferent teachers , about poor substandard housing , about high unemployment in the barrio , about radio and television shows that demean and insult his fellow paisanos . And he must be aware that local and federal government agencies largely ignore the plight of 8 million invisible Mexican-Americans . And he certainly knows that the television networks , national magazines and news syndicates are generally deaf to the despairing voices of the barrio , although the more strident voices from black ghettos get ample notice . Those same news media have been outraged by the alarming increase of cop killers  --  and it is well they should be , for any killing is abhorrent . But they should also know that the phrase is sometimes reversed in the ghetto  --  that Chicanos and blacks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ramon and the rest of us Chicanos have been urged to turn a deaf ear to the , dangerous cry of the militant , to listen instead to the voices of reason , to the voices of the people like Ruben Salazar . And though I myself felt slightly less than reasonable when those two cops shoved me ' against the wall on a dark lonely street , I would certainly agree that our only hope is reason and good will . One must also hope that the police and other authorities will come to realize that reason flows both ways , that this fragile society can ill afford the frightening consequences of the kind of overkill that silenced the most reasonable voice of Ruben Salazar. ?
