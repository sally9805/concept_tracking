The enterprising Brooklyn Academy of Music ( TIME , Jan. 14 ) is currently enlivening the borough with a four-month British Theater Season . With a flare of trumpets , a skirl of bagpipes and a welcoming speech from London-born , Brooklyn-bred New York City Mayor Abraham Beame , the Royal Shakespeare Company inaugurated the season with Richard II and Sylvia Plath . <P> It is the U.S. debut for the R.S.C. , which ranks second only to the National Theater ( originally the Old Vic ) in prestige among British repertory companies . Some London drama critics even prefer it to the older troupe . Playgoers ' expectations were high , perhaps too high . While these two idiosyncratic productions have not precisely dashed those expectations , they have perceptibly dampened them . <P> RICHARD II . This is not one of Shakespeare 's master plays , and it has no titan of a hero at its epicenter . But it can be a wonderfully engrossing drama , and it does contain grand , stirring and passionate speeches . In this presentation the play is reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a vain monarch who laughs at the discomfiture of his nobles , ravages their estates , and surrounds himself with fops and flatterers . Too late he finds himself deserted and his angry lords allied to his enemy Bolingbroke , who marches triumphantly across England to secure Richard 's abdication and his crown . <P> To personify Richard 's weakness , Ian Richardson plays the King as a kind of drag queen . This is disastrous . The epicene approach robs the audience of the pity it should feel for Richard 's painful self-knowledge in adversity , and mutes his ringing defense of the divine prerogatives of kingship : " The breath of worldly men can not depose the deputy elected by the Lord . " <P> In a play laced with some of Shakespeare 's most musical poetry , Richardson delivers his lines with inflexible metronomic monotony . Only Richard Pasco as Bolingbroke has a regal voice and bearing . He and Richardson switch roles at every other performance , but Pasco does not alter the effete interpretation of the King . <P> In a production that is stilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have rummaged through Peter Brook 's wastebasket for directorial inspiration while scanting Shakespeare 's genius . <P> SYLVIA PLATH . Romantic cults seem to spring up rapidly round poets who die young . An element of thanatophilia enters into the worship of such poets . It is somehow felt that they were purified by dying and spared the physical and moral corruption to which ordinary mortals are subject . <P> Think of Shelley , who died by drowning and whose heart was snatched from the funeral pyre by his fellow romantic , Trelawney . Or of Dylan Thomas , a sacrificial votary of drink ( Olympian draughts , of course ) . Since the winter day in 1963 when Sylvia Plath turned on the gas and laid her head in her kitchen oven , she has become a goddess of the thanatophiliacs . <P> Latterly , she has also become a symbolic figure to women 's liberationists , who think of her as a victimized woman . Plath was broke and alone with her two small children when she died .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
