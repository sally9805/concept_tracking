txt Israel is deeply concerned about the prospect of American arms sales to Egypt . Government sources summed up the Israeli view this way : " Were we certain that the Middle East was heading for peace , military supplies to Egypt or other Arab states would be of marginal significance only . But since a number of Arab governments stress the possibility of a warlike solution , the growth of arsenals increases the threat of a conflagration . " Israelis fear that the American sale of " nonlethal arms " to Egypt might open the way to massive supplies of lethal weapons to Israel 's southwestern neighbor . Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told the Knesset ( Parliament ) Monday that Israel had aired its objections to U.S. arms sales to . the Arab countries , mainly to Saudi Arabia . But // * Israelis fear possible U.S. arms sale // there were no assurances that such objections would bear fruit , Mr. Rabin cautioned . Similarly , Defense Minister Shimon Peres warned that although Egypt at present might have rejected the military option , Israel could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again in the future , after it had rebuilt its military power . Mr. Peres conceded that Egypt 's anti-Israeli propaganda had been less hostile than that of Syria . But Cairo , he said , had been torn between conflicting trends , and pumping military equipment into Egypt instead of economic assistance might strengthen bellicose pan-Arab pressures .. Resentment here of Washington 's move toward a military supply relationship with Egypt is all the stronger since it comes on the heels of U.S. military ' contracts with Saudi Arabia . The Chief of Staff of the Israeli defense forces , Lt. Gen. Mordechai Gur , stressed earlier this week that Saudi Arabia , like neighboring Egypt , Syria , and Jordan , considers itself officially at war with Israel . It is not only maintaining military units in both Syria and Jordan , he said , but also has started building missile bases , airfields , and observation posts , along the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea , thus bringing Israeli shipping bound forthe Indian and Pacific oceans within the firepower of Saudi forces . That makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gur commented . The gravest danger , in the Israeli view , stems from the fact that the growing accumulation of . American weapons and equipment in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere could easily be made available to other Arab states in case of an armed conflict . That was shown by the transfer of French Mirage fighter-bombers from Libya to Egypt during the 1973 war , Israelis say . Military sources here point to the statement of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near-East Affairs , Alfred Atherton , who told a Senate committee last week that although " there are serious political and legal restraints and technical limitations " there was " of course , no ultimate guarantee that military equipment.we sell to one state will not be transferred to another . " " It is surely no secret to American leaders , " the prestigious Jerusalem Post wrote in an editorial , " that the balance of power is decisively affected by the arsenals of such noncontiguous states as Libya , Iraq , Kuwait , and Saudi Arabia . " This , the paper wrote , may " blunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new heights , " and " increase the threat of war , which the U.S. has been trying to remove . "
