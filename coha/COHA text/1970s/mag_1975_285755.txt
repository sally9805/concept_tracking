Throughout history the aged have occupied a precarious position in society . Some primitive peoples like the Eskimos and other nomads respected the elderly but left them to die when they could no longer care for themselves . Natives of some South Seas islands paddled away from their families-to death-when age overtook them . Nor is the idea of abandoning the elderly unique to primitive societies . Marya Mannes ' 1968 novel They postulated a world in which everyone over 50 was herded into public institutions and eventually liquidated . A 1966 Rand Corporation study concluded that if the U.S. survived a nuclear war it would be " better off without old and feeble " citizens , and suggested that no provisions be made to care for the surviving elderly . <P> The U.S. has clearly not taken such advice . Most Americans , whether moved by religion or common decency , still try to follow the Fifth Commandment and " honor " their parents . But despite their concern , and frequently the anguish that marks their hard decisions about the elderly , the position of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of decades ago , most Americans who reached 65 , the admittedly arbitrary age for retirement , could look forward to spending their last years in peace and security , respected and cared for by their families and friends . No longer . For an increasing number of Americans , the years after 65 are a time of growing uncertainty and isolation as , cut off from family , beset by illness and impoverished by inflation , they struggle not to enjoy the rest that they have earned but simply to survive . <P> Their problem is a pervasive , urgent one , both for the old and for their children . America as a society has yet to develop a practical , human policy for dealing with the woes of old age in a modern world . For those elderly Americans who can still manage-both physically and financially-life goes on much as it always has . But for those who can not manage , the end of life , or at least of life as most people would want to live it , can be an agony . About a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already live in nursing homes , too many of which are grim warrens for the unwanted . Tragically , the population of the nursing homes is growing . But so , too , is the public 's concern over the plight of the old . Americans have yet to come up with the answers , but more and more are at least asking themselves the question that most must face sooner or later : What do we do with our parents ?
