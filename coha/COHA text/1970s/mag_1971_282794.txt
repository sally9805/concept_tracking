Even though television has pre-empted much of the visual reportage that was once photojournalism 's particular domain , the great photographer still has an unassailable place . He records the exact moment-seized out of the passing flux of the event-that fixes an image or an emotion for all time . Television 's eye is quick , but flickering . The photojournalist is a permanent witness . <P> At 55 , David Douglas Duncan is one of the greatest photojournalists alive , the Hemingway of a profession that , in its strenuousness and immediacy , can not have Prousts . " Have camera , will travel " is its motto and its boast . In the last 30-odd years , much of that time working for LIFE , Duncan has been nearly everywhere and done nearly everything-from catching monster squid in the ocean off Peru to recording the home life of Picasso . He has been shot at by Japanese ack-ack gunners , Korean snipers and Vietnamese rocketeers . All this is documented in a retrospective show now at the Nelson-Atkins Galleries in Kansas City , Mo. , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Few living photographers have exposed themselves or their film to such a range of coups , revolts , massacres and civil wars . The man is an anthology of risk ( the Yankee boomer from the Midwest , living out his own adventure yarn ) , and the egotism is as extreme as the bravery . Only Duncan , one feels , could have written a preface to one of his own books , Picasso 's Picassos , calling it " the most exciting and valuable book in modern art today . " <P> However lush the writings , the photographs are almost invariably lean and telling . Duncan 's instinct is for a photographic plain speech that puts all the emphasis where it belongs , on the subject , and almost none on the technique . At its best , this gives his pictures a marvellously laconic poetry , as in the shot of an Afghan tribesman washing his cups by the side of a lake in the Hindu Kush . Or a deserted cottage in Connemara , hemmed and compressed to the edge of survival between two gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental photos , taken with a prismatic distorting lens that fragments the image and reconstitutes it on the ground glass , are-on the evidence of the work in this show-rather less successful . They are consciously " art " and often end-like the 1963 photograph of Picasso 's face melting in facets through one of his canvases-as a surface parody of Cubism . <P> Men at War . Duncan 's best work , however , is his war photography ; he operates superbly under stress . " Anyone , " he declares , " can take good war pictures provided he 's in the right place at the right time . " Perhaps . But only a small number of other photographers , such as Britain 's Don McCullin or the U.S. 's W. Eugene Smith and Carl Mydans , have equaled Duncan in the dreadful succinctness of their images .
