HIGH above the Isar River embankment in the ornate home of the Bavarian parliament , the 74-man International Olympic Committee met last week behind guarded doors to select a new president . After the ballots were counted and burned , Irish whisky was delivered to the conference room . The choice of drink was appropriate . Some hours later it was announced that the successor to Avery Brundage , for 20 years the autocratic arbiter of international amateur sport , was Michael Morris , Baron Killanin , of Dublin . <P> The elevation of Lord Killanin came as no surprise . The only other contender for the post was Count Jean de Beaumont of France , who to many of the committee members seemed too much like the outgoing president . " We felt , " one member confided after the lopsided ( but unannounced ) vote , " that 20 years of Brundage had been ample . " <P> Most amateur athletes would agree . Unreasonably censorious and sometimes inconsistent in his decisions , Brundage has in fact been a controversial influence on the games for nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Olympic Committee in 1936 , he dismissed Swimmer Eleanor Holm Jarrett from the team sent to Berlin because she drank champagne during the Atlantic crossing . The same year , he countered attacks on Nazi anti-Semitism by issuing a brochure that argued that " the persecution of minority peoples is as old as history . " Since becoming I.O.C. president in 1952 , Brundage has , if anything , grown more stern and less realistic . He has crusaded against " shamateurism " and decried political interference in the Olympics while at the same time largely ignoring the major transgressors of Eastern Europe . In an age of liberalization and reform , he has become more and more of an anachronism . <P> Lord Killanin 's views are not diametrically opposed to those of Brundage . For example , he sided unsuccessfully with Brundage on the Rhodesian issue . But his new eight-year term does augur the beginning of some healthy changes in the Olympic movement . " I do n't believe in open Olympics , " he says . " I do n't believe in professional Olympics . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to enter the last quarter of the 20th century . " Killanin has already hinted at one possible change . In an effort to shake the image of the I.O.C. as " a board of old men , " he suggests that younger people-perhaps former medal winners-be invited " to consult with us in our decisions .
