It is 11:45 a.m. , and Gene Moore is scanning the cloudy skies , pulling on a cigarette , adjusting the treble on his stereo and aiming his blue Ford pickup truck toward western Oklahoma . <P> He is out to catch a tornado . To be exact , Moore is a storm chaser , and when he catches up with a tornado , it is not uncommon for him to bring it back alive on film . Thereafter scientists at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman , Okla. , can study it in the relative safety of the lab . Catching tornadoes sounds about as unlikely a sport as herding partridges on horseback . But when conditions are right , the NSSL sends out several vans packed with photographers , meteorologists and equipment , assorted airplanes and platoons of experts in hope of harvesting storm data . When people in Texas or Oklahoma or Kansas start running for their lives from a tornado , Moore and his colleagues are usually running full speed into it . <P> Today NSSL has word of storms moving east from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosed four aircraft , including one armor-plated job equipped to penetrate the severest storms . Six special Doppler radars , which are sensitive even to frequency changes in falling raindrops , have been focused on the western part of the state . And three storm chase vehicles like Moore 's are rolling westward . <P> Severe weather is expected all over the state , and the scientists at the Norman laboratory , operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) laboratory , have just launched the second part of a ten-week storm project called Sesame 79 . Part 1 examined regional atmospheric conditions . Part 2 is aimed at collecting data from specific storms . Nobody in the Great Plains is pleased to learn that a tornado is on the way . But these scientists , engaged in a $3.5 million project to help measure and ultimately predict tornadoes and severe storms , are excusably excited . <P> Moore is 32 and still working on his degree in meteorology at Oklahoma University . He admits fieldwork appeals more to him than the written thesis that still separates him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert contract worker and weather photographer , and when tornadic storms are pelting his truck with hail and threatening imminent catastrophe , Moore 's language can be impressively scientific . He has caught up with and photographed more than 60 tornadoes in the past eight years , and he speaks expertly of anvils and shears , gust fronts and vortexes , lips and inflow bands . <P> " I always watched storms when I was young , " Moore says . " I figured when I got old enough , I 'd follow one and see what it was like . " Sometimes these days , he sees them a bit too well . As the pickup hurtles along Route 66 , Moore recalls his last big storm . It ended up chasing him all over north central Texas , then dispersed , then treacherously re-formed and became the deadly tornado that killed more than 40 people last April in Wichita Falls . Moore outran it for 15 minutes , until it crossed the road behind his truck . Says he : " It sounded just like a commercial jet landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
