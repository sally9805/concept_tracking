There was a table on the lower level which was used for Sach 's Cafe , the Freiheit office and the anarchists ' commune . On the upper level there was a speaker 's podium .

He is an electric speaker . MOST We will see the world change . We are dedicated and determined men . We are men who know that a bloodless revolution is no revolution at all .

Carter Harrison , the mayor of Chicago , said that . A quiet , orderly meeting . It was clouding over . A light rain began . Very few remained to hear the last speakers . The police attacked again . EMMA 's following interjections into MOST 's text should be like a litany . We should get the impression that she feels this story deeply and that MOST becomes aware of her presence at the meeting because of the depth of her feeling . p. 9 GOLDMAN Captain Ward , accompanied by a strong force of police , suddenly appeared on the square . The police fell upon the people , clubbing them unmercifully . . . MOST There was a bomb . A bomb was thrown , killing a number of police officers and wounding many others .

August Spies answered his death sentence in these words : " Our silence will speak louder than the voices that you strangle today . " The eleventh of November . A five mile line of workers followed the martyrs to their graves . All sing , waving banners .

( MOST drains his glass and pours another ) Do you acknowledge the thought of William Godwin at all ? p. 13 MOST Another bottle please . He pours himself another drink and takes a deep breath . He finds EMMA 's intensity overpowering . Both EMMA and MOST drink a lot in this scene . By its end , they are drunk . GOLDMAN Because you say " a bloodless revolution is no revolution at all . " Which is what Godwin says , although of course he is not lead to your conclusion . MOST What is needed here is to lighten the atmosphere somehow .

MOST Perhaps if I threw the wine glasses against the wall . Drink up . We 'll try it . GOLDMAN Drink up ? MOST Toss it back .

MOST enters to deliver a speech to the audience . MOST Know your enemy . It is capitalism . It is the capitalistic system . Capitalism denies your humanity . Capitalism 's greatest achievement , capitalism 's crowning glory is the assembly line . The assembly line binds a man , a free man , to a machine . For up to fourteen hours a day the man serves the machine and the machine creates material wealth . The man serves the system and the system cages the man . We know that men are free . We know we can act . It is you who must act . We will act to free our brothers . It is the individual act of a free man that is creative . It is by the individual acts of free men that we progress .

MINKIN I 'll take a leaf from your book , Emma . I 'll confess something to you . When I am lying in a very narrow bed somewhat cold and almost damp , I am not amused by whispers and chuckles , by heavy breathing and theatrical groans , I am not amused by carols of joy from the room next door . You know when the sun rose this morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , do you remember ? I did not share your happiness . GOLDMAN We disturbed you . p. 41 MINKIN It is jealousy . I admit it . I see that I am weak and mean . Mean and weak , Oh God . I see why you do it , Emma . I see why you flay yourself with every emotion that flickers through your eyes . This is marvellous . Oh God , she said , she tore her hair , she tore open her waist . She fainted . ( FEDYA enters , shirtless , wrapped in another blanket . There is a large bruise on his chest ) Look , Fedya . I have learned from Emma . Self expression . I have freed my emotions . I am playing at being Emma and I have shut her up . I have finally shut her up . FEDYA I see that .

FEDYA Are you really hungry this morning ? BERKMAN You insinuate . FEDYA I ask about your appetite . BERKMAN I 'm getting out of here . FEDYA Eh , Dushenka ? MINKIN Oh , Dushenka !

Dushenka ! Dushenka ! GOLDMAN Wait a minute , Sasha , I 'll go with you . BERKMAN No . GOLDMAN I do n't mind . I 'll just get my coat . They exit in opposite directions .

PARKS That 's what I said . FRICK She 's talking about the struggle for the eight hour day . PARKS Do you understand German , sir ? KREIDERMAN Mr. Frick has travelled extensively . In Europe . PARKS Does he understand German , I 'm asking him . FRICK Yes . I do . PARKS Do you understand what she 's saying , sir ? p. 45 KREIDERMAN It 's in German , is n't it ?

They all speak German . KREIDERMAN ( To FRICK ) Is it subversive , sir ? Lights up full on EMMA . GOLDMAN In the past , we 've asked you to fight with us for the eight hour day . Now I 've come to ask you to stop that fight . We have something bigger to do . We must work together to destroy the capitalist system . Here in Rochester , we have been concerned with the eight hour day . In Pennsylvania , at the Homestead Steel Mills , the workers ask for higher wages and the right to organize . Sometimes we see no further than our own small concerns . We ca n't understand that as long as Andrew Carnegie owns the product of our labour , as long as Henry Clay Frick works for Andrew Carnegie , and we work for Henry Clay Frick , it does n't matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( KREIDERMAN and PARKS cheer at the sound of these familiar names . HENRY CLAY FRICK tries to silence them ) As long as Andrew Carnegie owns us , the world is horribly wrong . We must change the world . ( FRICK and the Pinkerton men are unmoved ) Until we own the factories , our work will be drudgery . When we own the factories , our work will be joy . All of us work fourteen , sixteen hours every day for the cause . We have dedicated our life to the cause and the work is our joy . We have no concern for personal comfort . We will work as long as we must . We will not stop working until we reach our goal . KREIDERMAN and PARKS cheer , carried away by oratory and occasion . FRICK waves his hand in the air . p. 46 FRICK Excuse me . . . my friends do n't understand your point . GOLDMAN ( To FRICK ) Are you factory workers ? FRICK I wonder if politicians ever think that their talk directs our lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to talk of abandoning the struggle for the eight hour day . Those who work each day for ten hours or twelve hours or fourteen hours . Those who have spent their lives in a mill and want nothing but a few hours every day in peace . They will be glad to talk philosophy with you . GOLDMAN Do you work in a mill ? FRICK It does n't matter . GOLDMAN Who are you ? FRICK It does n't matter who I am if I 'm telling you the truth . GOLDMAN I tell the truth . PARKS Kreiderman ? KREIDERMAN What , Parks ? PARKS You think she 's one of those suffragettes ? PARKS and KREIDERMAN are giggling and leering . GOLDMAN What about your friends . What about you ? How do you feel ? You are working men . I 'm talking to you . p. 47 FRICK You will excuse my friends . PARKS Hey , Cookie . . .

They exit . EMMA follows . BERKMAN , HELEN and FEDYA prepare to welcome EMMA home . They enter and the scene becomes the Freiheit office . BERKMAN Do you have the banner ? MINKIN Do you think Emma will like that banner ? What if she sees the other side ? BERKMAN The other side is " Remember the Haymarket Martyrs . " MINKIN It seems impersonal . FEDYA Sasha would say it 's a fine revolutionary sentiment . BERKMAN Sasha would say it is n't enough . EMMA enters , very downcast , in time to hear this last . GOLDMAN No , of course not . FEDYA Welcome home , Emma . p. 48 BERKMAN We came to make sure Johann Most put headlines in his newspaper . " Emma . . . The Girl . . . Comes Home . " GOLDMAN Words are n't enough . Words are never enough . Words are meaningless . FEDYA You 're a success , Emma . A huge success . MINKIN Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sasha . BERKMAN Fedya has composed a song on the condition that Helen and I will sing it . I indulge myself . GOLDMAN I am very ignorant . They sing " a capella .

He presents EMMA with a bushy potted plant . BERKMAN I chose the flower . For you , Emma . GOLDMAN Johann wants to talk to me . BERKMAN Fedya says it is a good sturdy plant . I see it is practical . I want it to be more than that . p. 49 FEDYA Johann Wurst wants to talk to you . That 's his name . Johann Sausage . BERKMAN Take your flower . MOST enters carrying violets . BERKMAN What is that ? MOST Violets . BERKMAN It is the middle of winter . Emma and he gives you violets . MOST You see she has taken the violets and you are left holding that colourful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry and he gives you violets . MOST Alexander Berkman does not have a generous spirit . BERKMAN I do not indulge myself at the expense of others . MOST You attack me . That is an indulgence . BERKMAN Violets are stupid . Useless . Extravagant . MOST You resent Emma 's success . BERKMAN I do not . MOST That is why you are angry . That is why you attack me . BERKMAN I attack you because you are wrong . p. 50 MOST You see yourself as a spokesman for anarchy . BERKMAN And I am . MOST Your dreary philosophy is anarchy . BERKMAN My philosophy is clearly reasoned . It is sane and humanistic . MOST You have no imagination . BERKMAN Of course I do not take theatrical poses . MOST You do make rules for anarchists , however . BERKMAN I do not dramatize myself until I 'm a figure of fun . MOST Anarchy is a living force above your rules . BERKMAN I do not see myself as a character in a cheap melodrama . MOST I see myself in Schiller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppet . BERKMAN Violets . Cheap theatrics . You are an old man dreaming of romances on the barricades . Emma will not play in your romance . MOST And here is the tragic Anna Minkin . MINKIN I 'm Helen . Minkin . MOST So you are . p. 51 MINKIN Anna is my sister . MOST It was seeing you with Berkman . Berkman and Anna Minkin . They are inseparable I had understood . BERKMAN Emma says that she must talk to you . MOST Then no doubt you will leave Emma here to talk . BERKMAN If she wishes . MOST And you will return to Anna Minkin . Since you are so seldom apart . BERKMAN We did not come here to discuss where I go or what I do . MOST Certainly not . Because here we discuss anarchy . We dedicate our lives to anarchy . We are not self-seeking young men chasing silly young women . BERKMAN I will ask you to be brief , Emma . MOST I will ask you to leave my office . BERKMAN Who ? MOST As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss . BERKMAN But not alone . MOST Yes . BERKMAN She 'll come with me. p. 52 GOLDMAN No , Sasha . BERKMAN Yes , you will . GOLDMAN I wo n't . BERKMAN I think Johann Most believes that man does not need law or government or authority because he feels man has some special strength . MOST That 's correct . BERKMAN There are others and I count myself among them , who want individual autonomy because man is inherently good . You pervert every principle of revolution . You lead the revolution because you want the power . You want to be anarchist king . Come Fedya , Helen . They exit . MOST I have brought you flowers . Violets . GOLDMAN I want to tell you about the tour . MOST I know about the tour . Do you like them ? GOLDMAN What happened in Rochester . . . MOST You were eloquent in Rochester . . .

We will not be apart again . GOLDMAN About the struggle for the eight hour day . MOST I do n't want to talk about the eight hour day . GOLDMAN I do . MOST Do n't be silly , Emma . GOLDMAN I will not be treated like a silly woman . You sent me out to speak for you like a trained dog . I 've made a fool of myself . I did n't speak for myself , I said your words . I 've said pretentious , pompous things . There are men who work fourteen hours a day . I spoke to them . One man came up after my lecture , Johann . Grey-headed , his hands shook . He had spent his life on a factory assembly line , Johann , and I learned more from his simple words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the symmetry of your world .

EMMA climbs on a table to speak . She is more confident and more convincing than before . GOLDMAN Women 's emancipation ? How much independence is gained if the narrowness and lack of freedom of the home is exchanged for the narrowness and lack of freedom of the factory , sweat shops , department store or office ? Why should I join a union ? I am going to get married and have a home .

First by asserting herself as a personality , and not as a sex commodity . Second by refusing the right to anyone over her body , by refusing to bear children unless she wants them , by refusing to be a servant to God , the state , society and husband , the family . By making her life simpler , but deeper and richer . That is , by trying to learn the meaning and substance of life in all its complexities , by freeing herself from the fear of public opinion and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make her a force hitherto unknown in the world , a force of real love , for peace , for harmony  --  a force of divine fire , of life-giving , a creator of free men and women .

The Czar steps from the carriage . Thank God you 're all right , sir , says the Cossack . PARKS ( Sings ) Thank God you 're all right , sir . KREIDERMAN Yes , I 'm all right , thank God , sings the Czar . The conspirator Grevevitsky steps from the crowd . His hands above his head . It 's too soon to thank God , he sings . He walks right up to the Czar and drops his bomb directly between them . Boom ! The Czar 's right leg is blown off . Above his waist his body is an unrecognizable mass of blood . KREIDERMAN exits .

MINKIN Come and be Alexander II . BERKMAN ( Horrified ) Alexander II ? MINKIN Alexander frees the serfs . It 's history . FEDYA It 's an advertising campaign . BERKMAN You are a traitor to our class , Fedya . FEDYA It 's a public service . To sell sardines . BERKMAN Alexander II freed the serfs because he feared the will of the people . He was a spineless worm . My uncle Maxim hanged the Cossacks . That 's history . GOLDMAN Sasha and Fedya arrive in New York . Friendless . Without money . They huddle together in a doorway as the wind whistles . As the snow blows . That 's history . p. 61 BERKMAN I will not tax you with this stupidity , Emma .

GOLDMAN The specialists urged an operation . He was surprised that I had been able to stand my condition so long . He said I would never be free from pain . I would never experience full sexual release , unless I submitted to the operation . MINKIN Heaven forbid that your sexual release should not be full . GOLDMAN He said I could never bear children . I love children madly . FEDYA You 'll make yourself sick , Emma . GOLDMAN I love babies passionately but I remember my own childhood . My father wanted a boy .

The catechism of the Russian Revolution says the revolutionary must give up his home , his parents , his lover , his children , everything . I agree with that absolutely . But I do love you . I wanted you to know that . FEDYA has tried to ease EMMA back to the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic . FEDYA tries to extricate himself from their embrace . p. 64 MINKIN She has fooled you again . All she has to do is scream and faint . GOLDMAN Helen , you must calm yourself . MINKIN Of course you and Fedya are only boys . You can not help your immaturity . A man of more experience , of more intelligence , a man like Johann Most would not be taken in . BERKMAN Johann Most ? Johann Most has had her name carved on his chest . MINKIN You are very stupid , Sasha , if you think Most concerns himself with a silly girl . BERKMAN He has made a career of it . MINKIN You show how small you are when you mock him . FEDYA Why is Helen so concerned with Most ? MINKIN I love him . FEDYA Go and make some popcorn , Helen .

They had fire bombs . They wanted to blow those barges out of the water , sir , so one of our men opened fire and then he . . . FRICK I suppose your man was mad with fear . KREIDERMAN Yes , sir . FRICK That one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mad with fear . He and his single police special killed one nine-year-old boy and five strikers . In pitch darkness from a barge in the middle of the Monongahela River . And the barge was being shelled , I think you said . KREIDERMAN Yes , sir . FRICK I suppose there 's no chance I would talk to this man . I suppose he 's now employed with a Wild West Show . KREIDERMAN There were other men began to fire , sir . It got confusing .

FRICK ( Behind BERKMAN ) Who are you ? BERKMAN ( Wheeling to face him ) I want to see your hands up . . . I want your hands flat on the table . FRICK ( To KREIDERMAN and PARKS who are moving in ) Get him out of here . BERKMAN ( Dodging wildly ) Get back . Get them out of here . Get your hands up . I 'm going to shoot .

PARKS There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take my statement ? PARKS Jesus , statement ! BERKMAN Will you take this down , please . I want a record of my explanation . PARKS You 'll hear it in court , friend . EMMA and FEDYA enter the courtroom . GOLDMAN Does it say in the newspapers they 'll allow Sasha to have visitors ? FEDYA It says in the newspapers he is a mad dog . Visiting does n't seem to be an issue . GOLDMAN They must let his family see him . FEDYA If he had a family . GOLDMAN I can be his sister . FEDYA Perhaps . GOLDMAN Like Louis Lingg 's friend . When Lingg was confined , his friend visited him in prison . They embraced and with the kiss , Lingg received a capsule of nitro-glycerine . I could make a capsule and take it to Sasha . Sasha will want to commit suicide . p. 88 FEDYA Sasha ? GOLDMAN I do n't know why he has n't killed himself already . FEDYA Sasha ? GOLDMAN He has tried to kill Frick and Frick is still alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His protest is over . FEDYA Maybe he 's waiting till the newspapers publish his statement . GOLDMAN It could be a posthumous statement . FEDYA I was joking , Emma . GOLDMAN You do n't think he wants to live merely to see his statement in the filthy capitalist press . FEDYA I do n't think he wants to commit suicide . GOLDMAN Why not ? FEDYA Would you ? GOLDMAN Of course I would . And Sasha would . Any of us would die for what we believed in . FEDYA If we had to . BERKMAN I have a letter from Emma and Fedya . It is bitter . They say that because Frick did not die , the moral effect of the act will be less . There will not be so much propaganda value . They actually presume to reproach me with my failure to suicide . How am I to kill myself ? By banging my head against the bars of my cell ? By what right to they reproach me ? By the right of revolutionary ethics , I suppose and they are correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fedya will have to forgive me . I did not think that I could live in prison , but I find I must . KREIDERMAN enters , as JUDGE . PARKS escorts BERKMAN to the podium/witness stand on the lower level . p. 89 KREIDERMAN Is it true that the prisoner wishes to conduct his own defense ? BERKMAN Yes sir . KREIDERMAN ( To PARKS ) He will need an interpreter . PARKS Yes sir . BERKMAN I . . . PARKS I . . . BERKMAN . . . address myself to the people . PARKS . . . make a speech to all . BERKMAN Some may wonder why I have declined a legal defense . PARKS Some may think funny I say no to lawyer . BERKMAN My reasons are two fold . PARKS I say two things . BERKMAN In the first place . . . PARKS One thing . BERKMAN I am an Anarchist . PARKS I am an Anarchist . BERKMAN I do not believe in man-made law designed to enslave and oppress humanity . p. 90 PARKS I say no lawyer can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on men . BERKMAN Secondly . . . PARKS I say two things . BERKMAN . . . an extraordinary phenomenon like an Attentat can not be measured by the narrow standards of legality . PARKS A funny thing like an Attentat is not like law . BERKMAN It requires a view of the social background to be understood . . . PARKS It depends where you come from . What you think . BERKMAN The translation is inadequate . KREIDERMAN We speak English in this court . BERKMAN My English is very poor . But it 's good enough to know he 's not saying what I 'm saying . GOLDMAN ( To FEDYA ) I have to speak to Johann Most . He can help us . KREIDERMAN Silence in the court . FEDYA If he wanted to help he would be here . KREIDERMAN There is a disruption in the court . p. 91 GOLDMAN We have to ask him , Fedya . We have to try . Come on . They exit . BERKMAN I have a statement . It 's impossible to understand my act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to know why you did it . We want to see if you did it . KREIDERMAN Whatever it is that he 's saying , we 've heard enough of it . BERKMAN The removal of a tyrant is not merely justifiable , it is the highest duty of every true revolutionist . Human life is sacred and inviolate . But the killing of a tyrant , of an enemy of the people , is in no way to be considered the taking of a life . In truth , murder and Attentat are to me opposite terms . To remove a tyrant is an act of liberation , the giving of life and opportunity to an oppressed people . KREIDERMAN Alexander Berkman . You have been found guilty of the attempted murder of Henry Clay Frick . And the attempted murder of Harry Parks . Of trespassing three times on the property of the Homestead Steel Mills and of trespassing in the office of Henry Clay Frick . I sentence you to twenty-one years in the Western Penitentiary at Pennsylvania . They exit . HELEN enters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to Johann . MINKIN He is n't here . GOLDMAN I must ask him to help Sasha . They are railroading Sasha into prison . MINKIN Yes . GOLDMAN Have you heard about it , Helen ? Sasha in prison . It 's dreadful . MINKIN Go away , Emma . GOLDMAN Johann will help us . MINKIN Go and ask him then . GOLDMAN He was our teacher . Of course he 'll help . MINKIN I suppose Sasha thinks that terrorism is part of Hannes ' philosophy . FEDYA Sasha made his bomb from Hannes ' book . MINKIN You ignore him except when you need him . You make fun of him behind his back . Fedya calls him Johann Sausage , is n't that right ? FEDYA Sasha 's bomb did n't go off . Either Sasha ca n't make bombs or Johann ca n't write books . MINKIN I do n't care what you say any more . You ca n't hurt me , Fedya . Because I 'm content . FEDYA Because you 're smug . p. 93 GOLDMAN We are all anarchists together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MINKIN I 've told you Emma , Johann is n't here . MOST enters and begins to speak to a public meeting . FEDYA and EMMA become part of his audience . HELEN joins him on the platform . MOST The capitalist press cries out against the anarchist . They want our blood . Why ? Because someone has made an attempt on the life of Henry Clay Frick . Alexander Berkman waves our banner and hides behind the name of anarchy but he is an inept , self-seeking bungler , with too much faith in a master plan that was ill-timed , ill-formed . . . GOLDMAN I demand proof of your insinuations against Alexander Berkman . MOST This is a public meeting . GOLDMAN Proof . MOST These people have n't come here to watch Emma Goldman in temperamental display . GOLDMAN They have n't come here to listen to lies . MOST I am an anarchist . Alexander Berkman has attempted a murder . He claims that I inspired him . . . GOLDMAN Attentat ! p. 94 MOST A fool calls me a murderer . FEDYA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were all my students . Berkman does n't learn very well . A young man with a toy pistol and more concern for himself than the worker 's problems . Berkman has failed to do anything but find himself the centre of attention . GOLDMAN His intention was serious . MOST He is a child . GOLDMAN It was not a toy gun . MOST It was not the gun for the job . GOLDMAN It was a cheap revolver . He had no money . Did you give him money ? Did you help him at all ? MOST Of course not . GOLDMAN Attentat ! MOST The Attentat is the act which captures the imagination of men and women everywhere . It makes everyone brave . It makes revolution possible . Has Berkman done this ? FEDYA Have you ? MOST Talk to the strikers at Homestead . Berkman tried to " save " those men but they do not understand him . They do not sympathize . They think Frick cheated him in business , perhaps . I have been in prison because of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95 FEDYA Berkman is in prison now . MOST I denounce him as a self-seeking fool . GOLDMAN I call you a coward and a traitor , Johann . MOST As you will . GOLDMAN You taught me . You called for acts of violence . Sasha is the one of us who moved against the injustice of Homestead . Sasha acts and you deny everything . Every principle you hold important , you deny . MOST You are hysterical . GOLDMAN When I met you , you asked me for an ardent friendship . Now you call it hysteria . MOST It is hysteria . GOLDMAN You do not act . You are impotent . MOST I do not think of anarchy as some kind of springtime sexual rite . FEDYA Johann Wurst . Johann Sausage . MOST Berkman 's mistress attacks me in the columns of my own newspaper . Because I talk about his stupidity . Because I tell the truth . Berkman was arrogant , opportunistic . GOLDMAN Stop it , Johann ! MOST Egotistical , pretentious . p. 96 GOLDMAN Stop it ! MOST Self-indulgent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The belt comes down on his back . GOLDMAN Be bold . Be arrogant . I am sure you will be brave . MOST Emma ! GOLDMAN Who is not with me is against me ! MOST Emma ! GOLDMAN I think for myself . I speak for myself , Johann ! EMMA is exhausted . There is a long pause . Though it may not be possible to arrange exits , EMMA and FEDYA are alone . FEDYA Anarchy is a glorious political theory . We have proved it does n't work . GOLDMAN No . FEDYA We said an act against a tyrant would begin the revolution . We found we were wrong . We said that man was pure and fine . . . GOLDMAN Man is pure and fine . FEDYA You are . GOLDMAN I believe in freedom , the right to self-expression . Everyone 's right to beautiful , radiant things . p. 97 FEDYA You are pure and fine and gullible . GOLDMAN ( Sings ) I know I can show you wonders I can paint the flags I fly I know dreamers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know dreams are going to flash across the sky . There are no countries There are no kings Only the people and all they can wish for All of the beautiful radiant things . I know I will do my living In my future not your past There are certain stirring speeches There are drumbeats every morning And the chance that things will start to move too fast . There are no countries There are no kings Only the people and all they can wish for All of the beautiful radiant things . ( END OF PLAY. )
