txt The land is quiet now . The only sound is from the wind that comes chattering across the waves of Lake Superior and thins out in the evergreen needles and over the seven inland lakes of one of the Midwest 's most natural ? and private ? sanctuaries . It swirls inward over the crystalline rock and narrow sand beach , down the Pine River ? a watery alley between many of the cabin-homes which stand sealed and cold in the winter silence . The families are gone now . The men are in their corporate high-rise offices , the women overseeing their suburban homes , children at school . Some will visit this frosted land again at Christmas , Until then the workers employed here will go about their duties , maintaining what nature , and the club , ordained for this land . TIIIS PRESERVE of more than 21,000 acres in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula is owned by the Huron Mountain Club , a group of wealthy families , many from the Lake Forest area and the Grosse Pointe suburbs of Detroit , who pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy . - It is virtually unknown to outsiders , except the workers who live in smaller cabins in the residence compound and occasional poachers who sneak across the patrolled boundaries to hunt and trap and fish . Some outsiders will try to make brief sorties on snowmobiles , making ribbed tracks under the birch and virgin hemlock forest , and spreading a gaseous trail that will be swept up and away by the strong , fresh winds . AFTER THE snow melts , leaving a mattress of pine needles and exposing the granite knobs of the Huron Mountains ' the land forbids easy entry . So do the , guards . They are uniformed and deputized by the Marquette County sheriff . A spokesman for the club oversees all living and security arrangements . " These people appreciate their privacy , " he says firmly . , So much so that there Is no telephone contact with the club . Messages are taken at a home in the hamlet of Big Bay and radioed or driven five miles to the gatehouse of the club at the end of County Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven mites to the spokesman 's office . OTHER RULES , voted on by the So permanent member families who are allowed to own homes here , forbid using power boats on the inland lakes , and motorcycles and snowmobiles except for the guards . On one of the lakes , only fly.fishing is allowed . The Michigan Natural Areas Council once praised the club 's conservation practices with the statement : " Unlike most pioneers , they found a way to live . in the wilderness without destroying it . " And later , faced with a federal takeover of their land as a nature preserve , a club spokesman argued : " It 's not really suited for mass recreation ? too cold , too few beaches , too far away . And if they just want to preserve the natural beauty , we 've been doing that for 70 years . " WE HAVE JEALOUSLY guarded the property from exploitation . We cut timber selectively . We let university people and foresters do research there . We 'll never let it go for subdivisions . " It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years there was fear that the land would be dug up for a vast radar-like communications system . It is called " Project Seafarer . " Approval of the project would allow the United States Navy to dig trenches three to five feet deep and about four miles apart over a 4,000-square mile section of the Upper Peninsula . The purpose is to establish radio contact with deeply sub .. merged submarines around the world and possibly to command retaliatory strikes in case of nuclear attack . CONSERVATIONISTS and residents have been worried about the medical dangers of such high-frequency radio signals . Sen. William Proxmire D. , Wis. has described the project as " The last angry hand from the grave . " Originally it would have covered the entire club acreage . Now the club territory is excluded , but the Navy denies any partiality . " The slope of terrain there is probably the most difficult in the Seafarer area , " said a Navy spokesman . " Most of the Huron Mountain range is excluded . " Cameron Waterman of Grosse Pointe , a former president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Navy . " We wanted to keep a very low profile , " he said . " We have no influence on anybody . We have absolutely no political influence of any sort . We go our own way . " ALTHOUGH HE does n't believe the project is any different from laying normal power cables , he admitted many members felt " relief " when the club area was excluded . While the club makes no claim to having power , its reputation , fed by its members ' desire for privacy , grows among local residents , and often involves more fiction than fact . " They really have fish in those lakes , " said a Marquette man recently . , " One day a boy was fishing and saw a fish just swallow a whole duck right off the top of the lake . " WHILE THE MEMBERS are admittedly well-heeled , a Detroit club member once said : " We 're just , normal , every day people . " There are some exceptions . Henry Ford built a " cabin " there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut at Ford 's old sawmill in nearby Pequaming on Keweenaw Bay . The Ford family gave up its membership after the automaker 's death in 1947 . Death of a member  --  usually is the only way a new membership opening is created . FORD 'S HOME was later purchased by the late J. W. O'Boyle , a Dallas oilman who , another story goes , once flew up to the club in his private Lear jet bringing his Labrador . He quickly decided the dog was out of place and ordered his pilot to take the dog home . The pilot dutifully flew the animal back to Dallas and then returned . ' A book published in 1926 by victor Elting-of Winnetka recalled that Thomas Edison was a frequent guest there , along with many Chicago mayors , federal judges ; and U.S. senators . Chicagoan Cyrus H. ? McCormick also was a member in the club 's early years . The club was Incorporated as the Huron Mountain Hunting and Fishing Club in November , 1809 , with 12 members owning about 7,000 acres and negotiating for 2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventh largest taxpayer in the county . The top six are power and mining companies. ? " THE , BOOK OF Huron Mountain , " privately published in 1929 , gives this account by a Pittsburgh man ; " Camping at the mouth of the Pine River in the ' 80s , we made excursions for trout westward to Huron Point and eastward to the Salmon Trout River . " Game was abundant ? deer , wild pigeons , and grouse . Pigeons fed in great numbers on huckleberries in the woods between the mouth of the river and Pine Lake . The forest was practic a 11 y untouched . Bears were few . Wolves made a great noise at night , and their tracks were plentiful . " Much remains the same . The ' wolves , however , have died out throughout Michigan . The club 's Wildlife Foundation contributed nearly half the $15,000 cost of an experiment to bring four timber wolves from Minnesota to the Upper Peninsula . The wolves either were'killed by hunters or died , however . The foundation continues to support research scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untouched areas to study . The club 's desire for exclusivity and privacy is defended by both scientists and nearby residents . As one forestry expert remarked : " What they want is a perfectly natural condition , and that 's what they 've got . " Let 's suppose 10,000 people were tramping through there : Do you think that beauty would still be there ? "
