txt Zambia 's decision to reopen its border with Rhodesia may well strengthen Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith 's hand at a crucial stage in the guerrilla war . It is this concern that prompted Tanzanian President Nyerere to make a vain attempt to persuade Zambian President Kaunda to rescind his decision . Zambia is the base for Joshua Nkomo 's faction of Patriotic Front guerrillas . The other faction operates out of Mozambique . Although Mr. Kaunda insists that his decision will not affect Zambia 's support for the guerrillas , Mr. Nyerere believes it is dangerous for Zambia to place a sizable part of its trade in the hands of an administration they have all pledged to destroy . Certainly the disagreement has put new strains on the front-line alliance ( comprising Zambia , Tanzania , Mozambique , Botswana , and Angola ) which could ultimately influence the course of the whole Rhodesian struggle . Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere , who flew to Lusaka with Mozambique President Samora Machel for a weekend meeting with Mr. Kaunda ; even suggested an emergency airlift of urgently needed goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow of Zambian imports and exports through the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam , which is badly clogged with shipments . But President Kaunda , according to aides , said the offer came too late and that Zambia 's economy would collapse unless it gained access to ports in Mozambique and South Africa . Landlocked Zambia seems to have had little choice . The immediate reason for Dr. Kaunda 's decision was the need to bring in more than 100,000 tons of fertilizer urgently needed for the coming season 's maize crop . Maize ( corn ) is Zambia 's staple food and without the fertilizer , now in Mozambique and South African ports , the country could face a // From page 1 Smith gains by Zambia border opening ? catastrophic food shortage next year , " If we had n't opened the border now we would have had to do so next year to bring in relief supplies . of maize , " said Dominic Mulaisho , President Kaunda 's chief economic adviser .

When the Rhodesian border was finally closed in 1973 , sealing Zambia 's oldest and best trade routes , President Kaunda was counting on alternative routes through Angola and via the about to be completed Tazara Railway linking Zambia with the port of Dar es Salaam . But the Benguela line was closed in 1975 as a result of the Angolan civil war and the Chinese-built Tazara Railroad has been something of a disappointment . So too has the port of Dar es Salaam . As a result of operational problems on the railroad and congestion at the port a serious backlog of both imports and exports has steadily built up . Earlier this month when the Zambia Cabinet anguished over the reopening of the Rhodesian frontier , more than 75,000 tons of copper , worth nearly $100 million , was stockpiled at the mines .
