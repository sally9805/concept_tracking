He set sail , leaving my mother there with four children , " He went to Lincoln , Neb. , to get a job . He worked there , got his papers , and sent for my mother . And he got a grant of 160 acres from the government of the United Stales . " I was born on that farm , in a dugout . They plowed the sod up , cut it in squares , put them on top of each other , Close-up and put a crude roof on . When I was 5 or 6 , my father built a log cabin . That was much nicer , to be on top of the ground . " IT WAS VERY primitive out there . There were no roads , no communications like we have now , The neighbors were miles apart . They were people who had come from England , Norway , Sweden , Germany . But we had occasional visitors , including Sioux Indians who would stop by . They were quite a warlike outfit , but they did n't bother us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffalo Bill , one of the greatest legends of the American West . " When my father left Lincoln to find his farm 200 miles away , friends gave him a big box , of ammunition , " Dr. Barker said . " After he had been on the road , he saw some game and thought he would take a shot , He went to load his gun and found out the ammunition did n't fit , so he took it to the farm and kept it in a large trunk . ' " One evening , a man stopped at the house and my father told him of all the ammunition , " The malt could n't use it , but he said he ' know a men who would like that ammunition and would pay for it . That man was Buffalo Bill . " HE USED TO do scouting for the government , you know , and he would come down the Platte River Valley and atop for two or three days . My brother was a very good hunter and shot , and he used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his knee and he would tell stories about Indians , He , knew a lot of Indian stories . " When Cwas in Chicago about 1910 , I saw his show advertised and I wanted to see him . He and Annie Oakley were out in back of a tent giving an exhibition of target shooting from horseback . I waited until they were through and went up and introduced myself . " He was ' inclined to ' be rather gruff and he looked at me and said , " Well , young man , you'ski got the best of me . I do n't know . you . ' Then I reminded . him , and nothing was'too good for me , " John Barker started school in a building that doubled as a church . " On Sundays the farmers would gather and if the preacher was riding through , he would preach . If not , the farmers would read from the Bible , " THE FRONTIER was not only primitive , but also harsh . Disease claimed many lives . " Every homestead had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Barker said . " Four of the children from our faibily were buried in ours . I think they died of diphtheria . " After a few years , the Barker family moved from the farm to a small town , Alma , because of Dr. Barker 's mother 's health . In Alma , his father ran a brickyard , where Dr. Barker worked until his twenties . " It was a very happy time . We had a nice home on a farm outside of town , We had wonderful horses to ride and a beautiful little creek with a dam on it so you could go bathing in it , And in winter we had ice-skating . We also had a tennis court . Our place really became a rendezvous for younger people . " Dr. Barker sang at the Methodist church when he was in high school and formed a quartet that toured the West . " I also used to give humorous speeches , " he said , " I was a pretty good storyteller . " HE PROCEEDED to tell me several " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was glad I was " broadminded , " He Said he often fells his stories to the women who spend tile winter in Florida at the same ' trailer park he does . " The ladies like to hear good snappy stories , " he said . In IUD Dr. Barker went to dental college in Kansas City , Mo . " It was only a three-year course then , " he said . " Then I came to Chicago to take a course at the Northwestern dental college , " He became interested in dentures , which at that time were pretty ghastly . " I had an office in the Flatiron Building , at Madison and Ogden . There were a lot of prominent dentists there , and I saw so many glaring errors In dentures , so many people with rows of perfect white teeth that looked like store teeth , " I decided to do it a different way , have irregularities show , put in a gold filling , I tried to copy natural teeth . I became known all over Chicago for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still proud of . I closed every August and gave everyone a month 's vacation with pay . We had wonderful times . We closed on Saturday , when most businesses stayed open . We used to go golfing , I think golf is one of the best linings 4n the world . I shot in the lower 80s and played into my early 80s . " Through his life , Dr. Barker also has enjoyed tennis , fishing , and sailing which he still does ; playing the piano ; composing music ; and writing poetry which he also still does . He recited from his incredible memory poems he had written in 1903 . Once in a while , he would forget a line and exclaim , " Damn ft , I ca n't remember that . " Usually he did after he thought a bit . Dr. Barker is also an excellent cook and he is especially proud of his pies . " I used to be quite a famous pie-baker , " he said , then gave a few hints on how to make a perfect crust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially fond of apple and cherry , but last year made a chocolate chiffon on his 101st birthday . IT WAS because of his cooking that he helped raise the three sons of a young dentist after their mother died . The dentist , Dr. Harold Forslund , had been a protege of Dr. Barker 's and he and his family lived with the older dentist . " After their mother died , they had a lady here cooking for the boys , and she became ill . I said , ' Well , I can cook . Suppose I take over . ' " He did , and it was like the television program " My Three Sons , " according to friends of the families . " I never had a nicer time , " said Dr. Barker , who was about 05 at the time . " I 'd come home from the office and the three boys would he sitting there , and they 'd all say ' What are we having for dinner tonight ? ' I liked it very much . " Dr. Barker has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about all " the gals " lie loved but never married " because I loved them all and was afraid of making a mistake ; " of being a sharp parties , a dandy ; of being a connoisseur of good tea and coffee and food and " Oh , yes , " he said again and again , " I 've lied a very good time .
