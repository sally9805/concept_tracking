For better or worse , mostly worse , the U.S. presidential campaigns begin earlier and earlier each quadrennium . Aspirants gear up sooner ; indeed , some , like Democrats Henry Jackson and George Wallace , never really geared down from their 1972 campaigns . And likely prospects are finding the need to declare themselves in or out sooner than ever before . For their own particular reasons , Gerald Ford recently felt compelled to assert definitely that he would run in 1976 , and Edward Kennedy that he would not . Last week there were two more decisions for ' 76 , both by liberal Democrats , one opting in and one out . <P> The man who announced in was Congressman Morris K. Udall of Arizona , 52 , the brother of the former Secretary of the Interior and a tall , effective politician who appeals to the likes of George McGovern 's 1972 constituency . The man who dropped out was Minnesota Senator Walter Mondale , 46 , a Kennedyesque liberal who has spent a year in " exploratory " campaigning toward ' 76 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , had taught him that " I do not have the overwhelming desire to be President which is essential for the kind of campaign that is required . " He had also discovered , of course , that there did not seem to be any overwhelming desire on the part of the electorate to see him a candidate . But that discovery has not deterred less able politicians , and in having the courage of his perceptions and acting on them , Mondale deserves some praise .
