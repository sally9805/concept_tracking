Familiar faces in new situations , familiar situations with new faces and a few far-out fancies worked around the standard detection plot . So it goes with this season 's new recruits in TV 's crime-fighting force . <P> Lome Greene , for example , formerly the gruff boss of the Ponderosa ranch on Bonanza , is reincarnated as Griff ( ABC ) , an ex-police captain who opens an antique-filled office as a Los Angeles private eye . The impossible-mission gambit is given a new workout by shows like Chase ( NBC ) , which stars Mitchell Ryan as the head of a police unit assigned to cases other departments can not handle . <P> Tough cops still come in two styles - young and hip , and old and grizzled.The former category is represented by Tony Musante as Toma ( ABC ) , a narc whose specialty is disguises . The latter style was best exemplified by last week 's The Blue Knight ( NBC ) , a four-hour special strung out over four consecutive evenings . Based on the novel by the Los Angeles policeman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid TV dramatic debut as a patrolman who has been on the same beat for 20 years and decides to bail out . <P> In keeping with the Thanksgiving season , the networks have begun killing their ratings turkeys . The New Perry Mason Show ( CBS ) , with the bland Monte Markham in the old Raymond Burr role , has been sentenced to oblivion . At least two other shows face a doubtful future : Tenafly ( NBC ) , with James McEachin as a black middle-class suburbanite who shuttles from kids and crab grass to detective assignments ; and Faraday and Company ( NBC ) , wherein Dan Dailey engagingly plays a private eye just home after 28 years in a Latin American jail on a trumped-up charge . <P> Among the survivors , three stand out-partly on merit as well as ratings - as the season 's hits : <P> Kojak ( CBS ) enables Movie and TV Heavy Telly Savalas to play a hard-bitten nice guy for a change-namely , a New York City police lieutenant . Savalas-three-piece suits , thick stogie , shaved head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetic , idiosyncratic performance that can carry a show . He is aided by scripts and direction that reveal a sharp feeling for the city 's tough lingo , roach-infested tenements and lurid neon street scenes . Last week Kojak solved the murder of a topless go-go dancer . The key clue that allowed him to trace the dead girl : the scars from silicone treatments on her breasts . <P> Hawkins ( CBS ) is James Stewart in the guise of an ol ' country lawyer who likes to let on that " moral dilemmas give me gas . " Along with his sidekick and cousin , nicely played by Strother Martin , he squared off in earlier episodes against big-city decadence ( the season opener featured a gay apartment house , an alcoholic actress and an attempted rape of a Lolita-like minor ) . But in next month 's installment the pair will really get to shuck the corn . They will return to Jim my 's home town in West Virginia to defend a man accused of committing a blood-feud murder with a muzzle-loading rifle .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
