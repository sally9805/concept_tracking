txt Letters THE RADICALS AHD THE POLICE To THE EDITOR : John Holt 's article ( " The Radicalizing of a Guest Teacher at Berkeley , " Feb. 22 ) , is of interest to me because when 1 was a visiting professor at Berkeley in the spring of 1968 , I had exactly the opposite experience . I could very well have written my reactions as " tentative conservatization by Berkeley students .... " Chiefly , no doubt , this shows that what one tends to start out with is reinforced by experience ; and anyone who compares Holt 's books on education with ' my " Tyranny of Schooling " can no doubt see why we would be pushed different ways by similar experiences . But there is one grave omission in Holt 's account ; the thing that I acquired at Berkeley above everything else was a profound sympathy with the harassed , mistreated , abused police of Berkeley and Oakland . The radical students at Berkeley are unquestionably more insulting and abusive to anybody who is associated with anything called Establishment than anyone I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have taught . The only parallel was some of the young Nazis I watched in Germany in 1932 . How can one possibly expect men under considerable pressure , as the police are  --  conscientious , strong believers in an ethical code -- to tolerate over the years the kind of abuse they receive from these students . If police were selected from the most restrained elements of the population  --  well paid , trained very carefully  --  then just possibly they might handle the situation with the calm that Holt hopes for . But when they know ? as is indeed true  --  that a high proportion of the long-haired , unkempt-looking students are among those who constantly abuse them , it is demanding more than is reasonble to expect them to keep their cool  --  laboring under the disadvantages from which they suffer . A good many times in my lectures and discussion groups I was exposed to students who assured me that I was a liar , etc. , and could not be listened to , and I sometimes sympathized with those who voted for Reagan . Had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic tradition of tolerating dissent , it seems to me I would have reacted just as the police did , on occasion . In other words , the kind of sympathy and empathy that Mr. Holt demands for the young is also needed  --  and for the survival of an orderly community ( especially around Ber ( // // keley ) very desperately needed  --  for the policemen , far less articulate , far less advantaged , much more handicapped . Let the students live with them for a while and learn to see their problems : they  --  not the Negroes , not the Third World students ? are the real outsiders , the real minority group , in Oakland-Berkeley ( and in some other college communities ) . And , although Mr. Holt does not seem to realize it , they too are humans . Mr. Holt 's fundamental bias is perhaps shown by his uninformed reference to S. I. Hayakawa . What Hayakawa is doing is trying to prevent violence governing academic life and intellectual presentation . This has not developed to anywhere near the same threat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others can hardly be expected to distinguish the rhetoric about violence at Berkeley from the reality at- San Francisco State , without a briefing and training rarely given them . LEWIS A. DEKTER . Belmont , Mass . Mr. Holt replies : " At a strike meeting in Berkeley , and very recently at the State University of New York at . Buffalo , I said to large numbers of students that though they were right in seeing the police as their enemies , as must anyone who opposes injustice , racism and war , they were technically and morally wrong in calling AT BERKELEY : A policeman attacked ; a student arrested . them ' pigs . ' To this must be added , as can be seen clearly in the first 10 minutes of Frederick Wiseman 's excellent film on the police , that the average policeman is doing for very low pay a dirty , difficult , discouraging and dangerous job that most of us would not do at any price and that would drive us half crazy with disgust and despair if we did . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed generations , the police in this country have regularly and routinely abused their power and broken the law  --  bullied the poor and helpless , stolen , bribed and extorted bribes , lied , planted evidence , framed the innocent , suborned perjury and perjured themselves , tortured , and , when they felt like it , killed . We can say truly enough that this is , at bottom , the fault of what Robert Lynd called ' our racket society , ' in which , from early in our history , men have always seen the jaw as something to be evaded when it Could not be used for private advantage . But to say that this is the fault of students insulting otherwise upright and honorable men is the rankest nonsense . " ? To THE EDITOR : I believe Mr. Holt is deceiving himself if he thinks the events at Berkeley radicalized him . Mr. Holt was an inert radical merely waiting for the proper activating agent to blossom forth full-grown . The strike at Berkeley appears to have served that function admirably . SIMON JACOBSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jacobson is quite right ; it was only with respect to the question of what a university should be that Berkeley ' radicalized ' me . But that is what the article was about . " ? To THE EDITOR : In spite of its many shortcomings , Mr. Holt 's piece remains a valuable documentation of what its title suggests : " the radicalization of a guest teacher at Berkeley . " As such , it is further evidence of the fact that " radicalization " may be operationally defined as follows : Take one normal , moderate human being ; expose him personally , through word of mouth or via television , to some unpleasant event like the beating of a student by a policeman , an act whose fundamental causes he is incapable of understanding ; and then encourage a healthy dose of sloganeering ( " Kill the pigs , " " All power to the people , " etc. ) ; finally , equate the cause of the immediate problem ( the beating ) with factors allegedly responsible for the miserable state of the earth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventuate in such picturesque absurdities as Mr. Holt 's , " Universities have got to get their feet off youth 's neck . " We do have problems . JAMES P. MURPHY , graduate student , University of Pennsylvania . Philadelphia , Pa . ? To THE EDITOR : One point in Mr. Holt 's fallacy-ridden article deserves some refutation because it seems to be the issue on which so many of the others hinge : open enrollment . While we can grant that open-enrollment - type policies for concert halls and libraries are beyond reproach , we must realize that attendance at a concert is not a vital part of a person 's life , and the average stay of a person in a library seldom if ever necessitates the exclusion of other patrons . Picture , however , a city with a limited number of hospital beds that are available to anyone who chooses to occupy one , ill or not . I would scarcely think that Mr. Holt would tell a dying man to look elsewhere while perfectly healthy men are taking a nap . It is equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( assuming that they can afford to do so ) while limited seats in college classes are occupied by those who are utterly incapable of even high-school work , or are actual-. ly enrolled for reasons other than educational ones . FRANKLIN ALLEN BEHRENS . Jackson Heights , N. Y. ? To THE EDITOR : Mr. Holt says , " It really is not reasonable to hate somebody ... because his hair is long or his clothes are funny . " I ca n't believe that either Mr. Holt or The New York Times is really that naive . Those people ( those of them who know what they are doing ) are walking epithets of obscene derision of everything the rest of us value and think we have achieved , or hope to achieve , for our country  --  not just some of the things we stand for and hope to achieve , but everything . That is the purpose of their appearance , and we know it , and they know we know it . H. M. SMITH . Fanwood , N. J. ? To THE EDITOR : Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I interpret as a frightening naivete . He acknowledges something that the radicals recognize  --  that is , the contemptible lack of restraint on the part of the police . It is precisely because the police " can not be trusted to remain orderly " that the radicals who themselves have chosen the path of physical coercion act as they do . They do whatever is necessary to bring the police to campus , and then they will do whatever they must to provoke the police to action . If one is repulsed by violence , he should be equally apalled by its use on either side . However , my main concern is with Mr. Holt 's comment that " nothing worth saving , or worth having , in the university is seriously threatened by the demands of even the most radical students . " What the radicals assert and what Mr. Holt seems to accept is that they alone recognize and have claim to curing the maladies of American society , and that in administering the cure they may rightfully curtail both freedom of speech and freedom from harassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down opposition speakers , disregard the votes that they themselves had insisted upon  --  this is to have visions of a radical university in which the current lack of social consciousness seems utopian by comparison . LANA POLLACK . Ann Arbor , Mich . ? To THE EDITOR : John Holt lives in a world different from mine  --  perhaps in " a nevernever land . " He considers the Berkeley students ' militant and violent acts a justifiable necessity . How would he like it if his political opponents treated him the way the radical students treated Berkeley and the police ? Mr. Holt finds no good in the university administration and portrays the " way-out " students as a little lower than the angels . He claims that the conservative university authorities did not " speak in the plainest and most direct English possible . " I live in a city where an Episcopal bishop and our superintendent of schools are evasive " way-out " liberals . That does not give their opposition the right to take the law into their own hands . He claims that the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radicals  --  are their safest targets . My experience has been that the storm troopers of the New Left , are arrogant and abusive vis- ? - vis the middle-aged and the moderates , as well as the police . Back in the nineteen-thirties , organized labor and the Old Left had to fight the police and the Establishment for certain basic rights . We did n't taunt the police and call them pigs and obscene names , But I do distrust " the angry rhetoric of our black-power leaders and student radicals . " After Hitler 's " Mein Kampf , " one can not be too careful . Mahatma Gandhi and Pope John were two saintly men who influenced ideas and events in our time ; and their life style was in sharp contrast to that of the students Mr. Holt defends . WALTER R. STOREY . Philadelphia , Pa . Mr. Holt replies : " If I , a citizen , beat a man savagely because he insulted me , I break the law and can expect to be prosecuted and punished . I expect the police to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not control themselves , do their duty and obey the law even under heavy stress , the least we can demand is that they be permanently barred from police work and the right to hold that kind of power and au ( // // thority over our lives . But what are we to say of the standard police practice of arresting and charging with assault the people whom they , sometimes without any provocation whatever , have beaten unconscious ? " To sum up , though it may be a mistake and a fault , it is not a crime to insult a man . It is a crime to beat him with a club . The distinction ought to be plain enough . It is also vital . Though some will find it hard to credit , I believe in law and in order , much more strongly than most of my fellow countrymen , and I see as one of the great problems of our time how to reconstruct them in a country in which those men most solemnly sworn to uphold the law  --  our Presidents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cynically and frequently break it . " FROM OTTO OTEPKA To THE EDITOR : The statement by Robert Sherrill ( " Birch Bayh Is n't a Household Word  --  Yet , " Feb. 15 ) , that I have been quarreling for years with my old employers at the State Department because I was chastised for slipping information to anti subversive Congressional committees is untrue and unfair . Also spotted in the same article is the term " witch-. hunting . " It is about as familiar to Times readers as the much hackneyed epithet , " McCarthyism , " frequently appearing in other Times articles : Neither is applicable to me . I have disagreed only with those who quarrel with the truth . I shall continue to disagree . I did not " slip , " or " leak , " or otherwise slyly or secretly convey information to Congressional committees . I appeared only before one committee . I did so at all times on its request and with the knowledge and consent of my superiors . It was my solemn duty and obligation to speak the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant documents to the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee in June , 1963 , I obeyed these tenets after the following events had taken place . 9A material conflict had developed between the sworn statements of my superiors and my own sworn testimony . 9My superiors had testified falsely concerning my character and performance and about State Department security practices ; on request , I provided documentation // Letters // which proved that they had not told the truth . 9My superiors had eavesdropped on my office telephone conversations ; in addition , they used concealed electronic devices to overhear all my room conversations . ( My immediate superior later admitted that I had done nothing wrong at the time. ) 9IMy superiors clandestinely entered my office , forced open my safe with power tools and other instruments , removed copies of official documents in my proper custody , altered such documents and attempted through this alteration to falsely implicate me in criminal conduct . To have protested these incidents to my superiors and to have expected a remedy from the same persons who were planning to get rid of me by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavailing . The former Administration punished me solely in reprisal for seeking , without its desired approval , a redress of grievances from the United States Congress . I had a lawful right to pursue this remedy . In the efforts to prevent a public disclosure of evidence in my possession concerning their wrongful acts in my case , Administration officials resorted to calculated threats and harassment in an inducement to have me resign before my hearing so that I would be stopped from placing such evidence in the record . I rejected all attempts because I knew that my own actions were correct and proper . My nomination by President Nixon and my confirmation by the Senate to the Subversive Activities Control Board was an honorable act that represents my vindication . It is a victory for truth over falsehood . It fulfills a promise both by Congress and the Executive to see that justice was done . Whatever purpose is intended by the recent rash of distortions and omissions concerning me in newspapers and on radio and television programs , whether they , occurred through design or indolence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of my entire case which contains ample facts for responsible reporting . Many journalists who have described my actions have also informed Dtto F. Otepka. readers or listeners of the incidents described above to enable the public to reach its own judgments as to the proprieties or improprieties involved . The doctrine of fairness that is editorially espoused is often ignored by a lazy or biased commentator who collects secondhand information and conveys it to an unwary public as the only relevant piece of news the public should hear about me . Fortunately , the moral fiber of most Americans is sufficiently impregnated with the deeds of men who stood up and fought for justice through honor and dignity , and law and order . In this respect my contribution to society is governed by the words of men like Gen. Douglas , who frequently referred to this prayer that he learned as a young man at West Point : " Make us to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong , and never to be content with a half truth when the whole can be won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty to all that is noble and worthy , that scorns to compromise with vice and injustice and knows no fear when truth and right are in jeopardy . " OTTO F. OTEPKA , Member , Subversive Activities Control Board . Washington , D. C. ? Mr. Sherrill replies : " The Congressional Quarterly is generally accepted by both liberals and conservatives as in objective journal . In its ' Congress and the Nation , 1945-1964 , ' the summary of the Otepka case gives this information : ' Otepka was charged by the Department with conduct " unbecoming an officer of the Department of State " for having allegedly passed classified documents relating to relaxed State Department security procedures to J. G. Sourwine , chief counsel for the Senate Judiciary Internal Security Subcommittee . Otepka admitted having given the documents to Sourwine .... ' Otepka was charged with , and on Nov. 5 , 1963 , dismissed for , violating three regulations governing the release , declassification and mutilation of Government documents . " As for the use of the word ' witchhunting , ' to describe the Subversive Activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Senator Bayh who used it . However , I certainly agree with him . Witches are evil beings some people think exist despite the fact that they are never found . The S.A.C.B. suspects that subversives exist , and perhaps they do , but in recent years the S.A.C.B. has never on its own uncovered any . " DAY CARE , PRESENT AND PAST To THE EDITOR : I would like to take strong exception to the many inaccuracies in the article " What Day Care Means to the Children , the Parents , the Teachers , the Community , the President , " by Patricia Lynden ( Feb. 15 ) , and to the misrepresentation of the West 80th Street Community Day Care Center . Miss Lynden 's description of the physical conditions at the center bears no resemblance to fact . The roaches she spoke of have long since been eradicated . I have never seen a roach on the premises , and my child has been in the center since September . Perhaps if Miss Lynden had chosen to visit the center this year she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our shabby , crowded conditions , we keep trying to make things a little bit better . In contrasting the Lexington Houses Center with West 80th Street , considerable coverage was given to their educational director , Mrs. Shirley Cowan ; yet , neither the name nor the views of our educational director , Mrs. Grace Richmond , were mentioned . I 'm sure Mrs. Richmond , who spends at least 10 hours a day plus Saturdays , will be delighted to know that Mrs. Cowan 's home is run smoothly by servants while she " brings richness and stimulation into the lives of children . " Miss Lynden spoke at great length several times on the telephone with Mrs. Richmond ; had she visited the school and spoken with Mrs. Richmond in person she might have been aware that she too does her fair share of bringing " richness and stimulation into the lives of children . " Why are Shirley Cowan 's fights with City Hall over late buses deemed heroic , yet our simple demand that the Department of Social Services not close our doors is considered militant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noisy and dramatic confrontation . " When our parents demonstrate , they lose money and jeopardize their jabs . But what recourse do they have when the D.S.S. threatens to cut off our funds ? It 's a bit cold to hold classes in Mayor Lindsay 's back yard . Bob Gangi has been extremely helpful to us and is a Teal friend of West 80th Street , but he has not mustered all the political support for us , nor has he raised all the money . The parents and the community , as well as Action Corps , the combined efforts of all of us working together and using every technique from block parties to benefit concerts , have raised the money to buy our new building . And it is the combined efforts of all of us that are now working to raise the additional $100,000 to renovate it . Miss Lynden , who appears to denigrate the efforts of Dorothy Pittman , might be surpised to learn that black people can not only muster strong political support , but they can also line up an array of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Wanting to Change a system which is obviously woefully inadequate to the needs of people , and wanting to mobilize communities to be responsive to their own needs , should be among our top priorities . Let 's not minimize and denigrate the efforts of those who try to lead the way . ( Mrs. ) LINDA GATES , Chairman of Parents Board of Directors , West 80th Street Community Day Care Center . New York . Miss Lynden replies : " The purpose of my article was to give a descriptive overview of day care in New York City . My intent was not to contrast , invidiously , two centers or their directors , nor do I think that was the tenor of the piece . If Mrs. Gates had not mistaken the article 's tone , perhaps she would not feel that mention of the roaches was unflattering ; nor would she have overlooked the paragraph which says that the children at her center are given as good care , and are taught the same rudiments of knowledge , as are the children at Lexington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs of the two centers . Accordingly , the article focused on the program of Lexington Houses because it is a more typical example of the city 's established day care centers than the West 80th Street Center , which is still trying to survive . I am sorry Mrs. Gates feels I have overemphasized Mr. Gangi 's role . " I do not believe that the characterization , ' militant , ' is denigrating . The people whom Mrs. Gates describes as ' those who try to lead the way ' have always been militant ? at least where they have been successful . To call them anything less would be to minimize their struggle as well as their commitment to it . " ? TO THE EDITOR : My daughter is now almost 28 and was a member of the first group enrolled in a day care center " which began " or " was instituted " to help working mothers . She is now married and the mother of two boys , but can not forget our blacker days . As a divorced young mother with a 2-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care for our children . When the City Council would not hear us , it was I who stood up and spoke anyway . I still remember my mother 's horror at seeing a newspaper photograph of me being vigorously escorted out of City Hall by two policemen for speaking out , although we were not on the agenda . My daughter remembers being carried on picket lines for day care centers . What I am saying is that from Mrs. Guggenheimer down we were all what would now be called militant . We fought for day care with properly qualified teachers , no means tests for applicants , and under the Board of Education . I understand one school board now has funds for such centers . The birth of day care centers , like all births , was attended by travail and struggle . Nothing just " began . " ' Nor will anything now be " instituted " unless communities organize and educate , struggle and sacrifice , for proper care for our children during those most crucial early childhood years . Without day care I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my daughter and I were a family , self - supporting and strong . We are still both involved in our respective communities giving of that strength wherever needed . MINNA R. FRANK . Long Island City , N. Y. PRIVATE SLOVIK To THE EDITOR : In Joseph W. Bishop Jr . ' s story , " The Quality of Military Justice , " Feb. 22 , a caption says that Pvt . Eddie Slovik was the only United States soldier executed during World War IL This statement is not correct and is not made , for example , in William Bradford Huie 's " The Execution of Private Slovik .
