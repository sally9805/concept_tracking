THE SPORTING SCENE AF TER the dramatic final match this year at Wimbledon , in early July , it seemed to a good many people who follow sports closely , myself included , that the greatest athlete in the world today  --  standing a definite rung above such remarkable performers as Jack Nicklaus ( a champion for twenty years ) ; Dave Parker , of the Pittsburgh Pirates ; Julius Erving , of the Philadelphia 76ers ; Guy Lafleur , of the Montreal Canadiens ; and Earl Campbell , of the Houston Oilers  --  was Bjorn Borg , the twentythree-year-old Swedish tennis player , whose victory in the men 's singles marked the fourth straight year that he had carried off the game 's most important tournament . This feat had last been accomplished in 1913 by Anthony Wilding , the leau idial of the pre-First World War era , and , in a way , it set a new record , inasmuch as Wilding and three earlier champions who won the Wimbledon men 's title in four or more consecutive years did so when the structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stands as the rest of the field battled through the All Corners competition , at the end of which he met the winner in the Challenge Round . In 1922 , this Victorian arrangement was dispensed with , and since then the defending champion , just like any other player , has had to make his perilous way , round by round , to the final during the two nerve-racking weeks of the championship . Borg , who is sturdily built , stands five feet eleven and weighs a hundred and sixty-five pounds , hut , possibly because he has very long legs and very broad shoulders , he looks somewhat bigger than these dimensions would suggest . On his visits to Wimbledon during his middle and late teens , he was the special favorite of the starry-eyed battalion of English schoolgirls that flocks to the championships , for he is an appealing young man . He has pale-blue eyes set deep in a strong-featured face , which is framed by blond-brown hair , worn long , and occasionally by a patchy growth of dark-brown hair  --  the beginnings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tournaments , almost as if its presence were meant to remind him that there is work to he done . Borg rarely shows any expression on court except a characteristic frown of concentration . Moreover , from the start of his career he has exTHE SLAM THAT FAILED hihited an astounding sang-froid ; perhaps an exceedingly low pulse rate of thirty-five beats per minute accounts in good measure for this . However that may he , when you watch Borg in action you get the feeling that he is a deeply confident person , who has no need to dramatize himself , and who knows that he functions best if he keeps his emotions well in hand . His self-control has never been more conspicuous than in his matches with his longtime rival Jimmy Connors , who deliberately tries to nettle his opponents and is very good at it . Connors has never succeeded in getting to Borg . In my mind 's eye is a familiar picture : Connors is performing some charade that is calculated to put down and upset his opponent , but on the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is walking in his hunchy way toward the baseline , honestly unconcerned with what Connors may be up to . From the standpoint of the number of years that he has been playing tournament tennis at the top level , Bjorn Borg is a lot older than his age . He was only fifteen when , early in 1972 , he shot into the spotlight by defeating Onny Partin , a New Zealander almost ten years his senior , in a Davis Cup match at Bastad , in southern Sweden . In the spring of 1974 , playing on clay  --  the surface he had grown up on  --  he won the Italian Open and then his first major championship , the French Open . That summer , he won the first of three consecutive United States Professional Championships on a clay-type surface at Longwood , outside Boston . In 1975 , with Borg leading the way , Sweden won the Davis Cup for the first time , defeating Czechoslovakia , 3-2 , in the final round , in Stockholm  --  to the great delight of a country where the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both King Gustaf V and his son Gustaf VI had for the game . A year later , just after his twentieth birthday , Borg took a giant step when he won the first of his four consecutive Wimbledon championships . Wimbledon , of course , is played on grass , a surface he had had little familiarity with , and which people thought might not be suited to his rather unorthodox strokes . Lew Hoad and Ken Rosewall were wonderful players when they were still in their teens  --  at eighteen , they won the doubles at Wimbledon  --  but many tennis authorities are of the opinion that there has never been a better player at fifteen , sixteen , seventeen , eighteen , and nineteen than Borg was . Surely no other player has ever accomplished so much before he turned twenty-one . Yet this summer , as Borg rested up in late July and early August at his home on Kattils6 , an island in the Baltic Sea , lie was very well aware that there were still some worlds for him to conquer  --  principally the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reached the final twice , in 1976 and 1978 . Both times , he faced Connors , who in 1975 had eliminated him in a tight match in the semifinals , 7-5 , 7-5 , 7-5 . Their 1976 final was a memorable one . The two men were in excellent form  --  something that does n't happen very often in tennis  --  and there were many dazzling sequences of attack and counterattack The scores of the sets were 6-4 , 3-6 , 7-6 , 6-4 . The tie breaker that decided the third set in effect decided the match : after fending off four set points , Connors at length pulled it out , eleven points to nine . The 1978 final was a letdown . The night before , Borg had the misfortune to develop an infected blister on the thumb of his racquet hand , and , despite painkilling injections , he could n't begin to do himself justice . It was Connors , four , two , and two , to use the insiders ' jargon . ( As for 1977 , a shoulder injury forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen to Dick Stockton shortly after they had started the third set . ) On the eve of the recent U.S. Open , on the hard-composition courts of the new stadium in Flushing Meadow Park , Borg was looking forward eagerly to making up for all these disappointments . He had a further incentive : since he had won the French Championship this year for a fourth time , just previous to Wimbledon , a victory at Flushing Meadow would give him a chance to try to add the Australian Open in late December and so become the third man ever to achieve a Grand Slam of the four major tennis championships . ( Don Budge did it in 1938 and Rod Laver in 1962 and 1969 . ) As we know , this did not happen . The prospect of a slam was shattered in the quarter-finals at Flushing Meadow by Roscoe Tanner , the man Borg had beaten in the stirring Wimbledon final some two months earlier . The scores of Tanner 's victory were 6-2 , 4-6,6-2,7-6 , and they provide an accurate picture of Tanner 's superiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , incidentally , since mid-May , when he had been forced by an injury to default in an early round of the German Championship to Eliot Tcltscher , a young American . Beginning with the French Championship , Borg had then won thirty-one matches in a row . ADOZEN years ago , before open tennis arrived , and when the game was still looked upon by most sports fans as an elitist diversion that required skill , to be sure , but nothing like the kind of mental and physical toughness that was essential in football , basketball , hockey , and even baseball , few people would have taken you seriously if you had suggested that a tennis player might well be the best athlete in the world . Today , when millions have watched the champions either in person at tournaments or on telecasts of those tournaments , it is generally appreciated that in all probability no other game demands such extraordinary coordination , concentration , and stamina of its top players as tennis does , especially when those players arc caught up in a long match under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours or so , with only momentary breaks to rest and collect themselves . Things have reached the point where one frequently hears it said of Borg that he is a better athlete than he is a tennis player . This has also been said of players before him  --  of Roy Emerson and Vic Seixas , - for example . Emerson 's strokes were much more than adequate , but it was his speed , the quickness of his reflexes , and his determination that made him so outstanding in his day . Seixas ' ground strokes were rickety at best , and he was forced to rely on his serve , his volleying , his court coverage , and his heart . The old tennis hands who speak of Borg as being first and foremost a superlative athlete do so because his ground strokes  --  the foundation of his game  --  bear little resemblance to the classic strokes of the great champions . ( One reason , aside from his record , that Bill Tilden is remembered vividly almost fifty years after his last Wimbledon victory as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style to his play : he covered the coon with long , graceful strides , and his wide variety of strokes were beautifully produced . ) Both Borg 's forehand and his two-fisted backhand are looped high over the net . Both are hit with terrific top spin . This gives them a dipping flight that brings them down comfortably in court and also makes them extremely difficult to volley . Burg does not get his top spin by meeting the ball well in front of his body , which is the accepted method . Rather , he takes the hall at the top of its bounce or sometimes an instant later , when it is on its way down , and he depends on the vigorous action of his hips and shoulders to whip his racquet up and through and over the ball . " When Bjorn was first starting out , some of us thought he might injure himself , " Mark Co. , the veteran English star , recalled this summer . " He used his body much more forcefully than any player we had seen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strokes . On his serve , which was not your copybook serve , he twisted his back in such a way that you did n't sec how it could stand up to the strain he put on it . Over the years , Borg has changed his service motion a good deal , but he has n't changed his ground strokes , and that only goes to prove that there are many ways to hit a tennis ball . " In the last three years ( who turn into her clown attendants ) help her , though it lands them in jail . How can they not help ? The boy prodigy is like their Mozart . The film goes off in this weird direction , yet it all seems uncannily logical and prepared for . At the end , the woman has her child lover and is pregnant as well . It 's bewildering yet mysteriously right , satisfying , down to the pensive sounds of Schubert at the end . There 's a gravity to this film  --  to Blier 's generous , amused giving in to a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that what women want men for is to perpetuate the species  --  that they really want a child . And he has corn-pounded this fantasy by having a child father the child , thus eliminating the need for men altogether . " Handkerchiefs " is a farce that turns into a fable . Now we recognize why everything about the young wife is so ambiguous  --  that melting look in her eyes , her shimmering beauty . Now we can understand Dewaere 's double take when he was spending a night with her and said he wondered what her husband was doing , and she said " Who ? " This is a sleeping-beauty fable , but told from the point of view of a man 's erotic fears . This woman is to be awakened not by a prince but by a princeling . At the moment that her child lover is seducing her , in the sleeping quarters at the summer camp , the two chumps come down the hallway , pause outside her door , and discuss whether to go in . They decide that there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a funny moment , yet there 's poetic tension in it , and the hallway has a palpable sensual beauty . They 're losing out forever . All three of these films are abour two pals who do n't really understand women  --  and their not understanding women is part of their bond . The teamwork of the actors is the true marriage . Depardieu , with his beautiful long jaw and his loping walk , and Dewaere , with his nearsighted vagueness ( he 's like a more delicate Timothy Bottoms ) , move together rhythmically . Marielle and Rochefort twitch and grimace and drop their eyelids in perfect counterpoint ; their show of revulsion at women is the flirtation dance of impotent rou  --  s . The pal teams in these movies have intuitive rapport . They hang loose when they 're together . In " Handkerchiefs , " Blier 's fantasy themes seem to turn against the male fantasist . There 's pain along with the humor . The thirteen-year-old wh. ) arouses the wife is a variation of the jailbird who aroused the beautician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat rested entirely on himself , rather than play a team sport . ( Walter Hagen , who was a promising pitcher as a young man , had a somewhat similar reason for choosing to make his career in golf and not in baseball . As he expressed it , in baseball eight other players could lose a game for you but in golf there was only yourself . ) At about this time , Borg 's tennis began to improve noticeably . Through constant play on clay in the summer and indoors on wood in the cold-weather months , lie arrived at the point where he could rely on getting good top spin on both his forehand and his backhand drives , and this not only gave him more control but allowed him to hit out with greater velocity . When he was fifteen , two critical events took place . As was noted earlier , he was selected for the Swedish Davis Cup team , and in the match with New Zealand he defeated Partin after losing the first two sets This was a signal achievement . Ile felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the top six or eight players in the world  --  and , with his parents ' consent , he left school , so that he could give all his time to his tennis , playing tournaments at home and abroad . That June , shortly after turning sixteen , he made his first appearance at Wimbledon , playing in the Junior Championship . In the final , he met Buster Mottram  --  the son of two English internationalists , Tony Mot-tram and Joy Gannon . In the third , and deciding , set he trailed Mottram 2-5 . At this juncture , he thought he would probably lose . He just tried to play his own game and stay in the match , but suddenly everything turned around , and he won the next live games and the set . Throughout his career , Borg has shown a rare ability to fight back and win when all seemed lost . Dedicated Borg watchers , who keep detailed records of his matches , pride themselves on being able to rattle off the scores of his many comeback victories . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Spain , 2-6 , 6-7 , 6-0 , 6-1 , 6-1 in the final of the 1974 French Championship , and coming from two sets down to defeat Mark Edmondson , of Australia , 3-6 , 7-9 , 6-2 , 6-4 , 6-1 in the second round at Wimbledon in 1977 . The next year at Wimbledon , he was down two Sets to one against Victor Arnaya , of the United States , in the first round , and came back to win , 8-9 , 6-1 , 1-6 , 6-3 , 6-3 . This year , he did the same thing in the second round at Wimbledon , against Vijay Amritraj , of India , winning by a score of 2-6 , 6-4 , 4-6 , 7-6 , 6-2 . Neither Borg nor Bergelin understands why Borg tends to be such a slow starter . " We know he is able to play his was , back into most matches , " Bergelin told me during a long talk we had in Toronto . " His unusual physical stamina has a lot to do with this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a match goes to a fifth set . There 's one other thing that is very important : Bjorn hates to lose . He hates to lose even when he practices  --  I 'm referring to the practice games he Iikes to play near the end of a workout . " Bergelin , who is fifty-four , was one of the finest players ever produced in Sweden . He had very pretty strokes , and such a sound rhythm that he was always in demand as a practice partner . In the years right after the Second World War , Bergelin , a tall , blond man from Alingss , a town at the southwestern tip of the country , near Goteborg , won the Swedish Cham-pionship nine times , was three times a quarter-finalist at - Wimbledon , and carried off the German Champion-ship , the French Indoor Champion-ship , the big Monte Carlo tournament , and a number of other events dur-ing his European campaigns . The high point of his career came in 1950 , when Sweden met Australia at the Westchester Country Club in the Interzone Final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , outplaying John Brom-wich and the awesome Frank Sedgman . ( Aus-tralia , however , took the other two singles and the doubles to scrape by , 3-2 , and went on to the Chal-lenge Round , at Forest Hills , where it knocked off the defending nation , the United States , 4-1 . ) Bergelin re-tired from competition in 1959 and , moving his family to Saltsji3-Duvnas , suburb of Stockholm , operated a sales agency for Vespa and Lambretta motor scooters . He came out of retirement briefly in 1965 to lead a group of five young Swedish players on an extended tour of Australia . During the sixties , the standard of Swedish tennis slipped badly , and in 197U Bergelin was asked by the Swedish Tennis Federation if he would accept the captaincy of the Davis Cup team . He said he would be pleased to if the federation would underwrite a program that would allow him to collect a squad of the best young players  --  ten boys and five girls  --  and tour the world annually with them for six or seven months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing the multitude of good players their age then coming to the fore ; a more limited program , he felt , would not achieve the desired results . The federation agreed to his terms , and in 1971 Bergelin accepted the captaincy . The youngest member of his squad was Borg , who was then fourteen . Before the year was over , he was beating all the other young men on the team , even though some were three or four years older . In 1975 , I3ergelin 's program paid off , beyond expectations : for the first time in history , Sweden captured the Davis Cup , defeating Czechoslovakia , 3-2 , in the final round , before ecstatic crowds in the Kungliga Tennishallen , in Stockholm . Borg , who had bloomed into an international star the previous year , when he won the Italian Championship , at seventeen , and the French Championship , shortly after his eighteenth birthday , was just about the whole story . In his first singles match , he overwhelmed Jiri Hrebee , 6-1 , 6-3 , 6-0 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the pivotal point by beating Jan Kodes and Vladimir Zednik , 6-4 , 6-4 , 6-4 . He then provided the clinching third point with a decisive victory over Kodes , the 1973 ' Wimbledon champion , 6-4 , 6-2 , 6-2 . The following year , when Borg was unavailable because of injuries , Sweden was not able to hold on to the cup , and Bergelin , his mission accomplished , resigned the captaincy . By this time , he was travelling the world tournament circuit with Borg , and he has continued to do this . Theirs is a most congenial and successful relationship . ALTHOUGH from a distance the life of a modern tennis star looks glamorous , it is anything but . To begin with , the constant travelling is wearing . A player must also apportion a fair amount of his time to the media covering the tournament , the tournament sponsors , and the representatives of the companies whose products he endorses , and he must also acknowledge in some degree the support of his adoring Fans . While the prize money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time , they also increase the pressure a player feels . With all these enervating distractions , it is difficult for a touring pro to keep his mind on his work , his body in tune , and his approach to the game healthy and sound enough so that he can adjust to the loss of a crucial set without unravelling and come hack from the loss of a match with his confidence intact . Today , there are so many proficient players that even the men at the top of the tree must expect to suffer their quota of defeats . What Bergelin does for Borg is to relieve him of the many nagging little tasks that are part of a tournament player 's life and so allow him to concentrate totally on his tennis . Bergelin makes the travel arrangements , handles the hotel and local-transportation problems , reserves the practice courts for the hours that Borg prefers , looks after his racquets and his other tennis equipment , takes all his phone calls ( they sometimes run between twenty-five and fifty a day ) , and helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations to the media , the tournament , and his commercial affiliations at what are for hint the most suitable times , Back when Borg was still in his teens and his knowledge of tennis was hardly as extensive as it now is , Bergelin , if he thought that it might he of value , would talk over certain technical and tactical matters with him and discuss the strong and weak points of his opponents , but for some years now Borg , who is a self-reliant person , with a keen mind and an observant eye , has not needed this assistance . He knows full well what he must do in each match and how to go about doing it . In their talks , accordingly , Bergelin simply brings up small things that he thinks Borg ma ) not he aware of ; for example , he may point out to him that he is not tossing the ball - high enough on his service , or that he has been positioning himself too far behind the baseline when he is receiving service . In recent years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masseur . Ordinarily , he gives Borg an intensive massage once every dozen days or so , but , during tournaments , when Borg feels that certain muscles are tightening up Bergelin goes to work nn them . ( Bergelin learned about massage in his playing days . He had a series of aches and pains that his doctors were n't able to do much about , but when he went to see a friend who was a masseur for a soccer team and knew all about the muscles used in the various sports his miseries vanished . ) Bergelin is no longer able to cover the court quickly enough and hit the ball with sufficient pace to provide Borg with the kind of partner he needs in a serious practice session . ( If Vitas Gerulaitis is around , Borg generally practices with him . ) However , Bergelin is always available when Borg wants a mild workout in which he can loosen himself up . So is Borg 's fiancee , Mariana Simionescu , a pleasant , attractive , auburn-haired young Rumanian who is a fairly good player on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play some tournaments , devotes herself primarily to Borg and his career . The three are always together as they travel the globe  --  Borg , Simionescu , and Bergelin . " I should say that one of the most important things I do for Bjorn is to he a good friend , " Bergelin said when we talked . " That is not hard . We know each other well , we get along well , we enjoy talking tennis together , and when he feels tired and overworked I can help out by being good company . It is necessary , you know , for a player to have the right mental approach in order to play well . The mind must be clear in order for the body to perform at its best . Also , a player must win in proportion to his talent  --  with all the work he puts in , he must get something out of it . I think that today Bjorn is a very happy young guy . " Borg has a matching regard for Bergelin . " We are almost like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lennart has a nice touch . He always gets you in a good mood , and that is a big thing when you are playing professional tennis tournaments . " IT is not uncommon in sports for high-school and college stars to reach their peak rather early and then slip downhill and out of sight . In tennis , there is really no way to tell which players will undergo this fate and which ones will continue to get better as they grow older . Borg is one youthful prodigy who has kept on adding to his skills . His first big breakthrough came a few weeks after he had turned twenty , in 1 9 7 6 : he won his first Wimbledon . In a way , this was not unexpected , for by that time Borg had won the French Championship twice , the Italian Championship , the World Championship Tennis final , and a large number of W.C.T. and Grand Prix tournaments around the world . In another way , however , his victory at Wimbledon did come as something of a surprise , since he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it resulted in large measure from his defeat by Adriano Panatta , of Italy , in the quarter-finals of the French Championship that year . His early exit gave him a full week and a half in which to get ready for Wimbledon , anti he made the most of it . He and Bergelin went directly to London from Paris , and made their headquarters at the Cumberland Club , in the Hampstead area . It was the perfect place for their purpose  --  a small club where Borg could practice in comparative privacy . He and Bergelin were in full accord on one major point : to win on grass , it is necessary to have a first-class serve . Consequently , two of he six hours that Borg practiced each day were spent serving , serving , serving . Up to this time , Borg 's serve , a wristy one , had done something more than put the ball in play but no one had considered it a true attacking weapon . As he worked on it at the Cumberland Club  --  where he was fortunate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythm and timing gradually improved , and he found himself moving into a bigger service motion and using a different kind of body movement . One day , it came . The ball began to explode off his racquet face , and he began to get a higher percentage of his first serves in . When he unveiled his new serve at Wimbledon , everyone was stunned by how good it was , and flabbergasted that he had been able to develop it in so short a time . Because of his more strenuous service motion , he pulled a muscle in his stomach during his fourth-round match and had to rake a cortisone injection before each of his subsequent matches to dull the pain . Nevertheless , he served brilliantly throughout the tournament . The rest of his game was also in top order , and he went through the championship without the loss of a set , defeating Tanner 6-4 , 9-8 , 6-4 in the semifinals his toughest match  --  and domi-nating Ilie Nastase iii the final , 6-4 , 6-2 , 9-7 . Borg considers the 1976 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You must expect to run into some difficulties in a championship , but that year at Wimbledon everything went right . I played in best tennis in every match . " The emphatic quality of Borg 's triumph in 1976 has unquestionably had something to do with his continued success at Wimbledon . In 1977 , he defeated Connors in the final in five hard-fought sets , 3-6 , 6-2 , 6-1 , 5-7 , 6-4 . This was his first victory over Connors in a major championship . Their intense rivalry goes hack to 1973 , when Borg , who is almost four years younger than Connors , won a close match with him in the semifinal round of the Stockholm Open . Connors , a tremendous tennis talent , won the next seven times they met . At last , early in 1977 , Borg stopped him in the final of the Pepsi Grand Slam , a television special held in Boca West , Florida , and then heat him in the Wimbledon final , Over the last two years , they have played each other nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have included the 1978 Wimbledon final , in which he was in charge all the way 6-2 , 6-2 , 6-3 ? and a collision in the semifinals at Wimbledon this year , when he again won handily , 6-2 , 6-3 , 6-2 . In this match , Connors played considerably better than the scores indicate , but Borg played superlatively well  --  much more solidly than he did in outlasting an inspired Tanner in the final , 6-7 , 6-1 , 3-6 , 6-3 , 6-4 . For several reasons , that protracted duel between Tanner and Borg is worth closer inspection . For one thing , Borg , outwardly as composed as ever , was far more nervous when he stepped onto the Centre Court than he had been in a long , long while . He was only too conscious that it lay in his grasp to make history by becoming the first player in modern times to win Wimbledon four years in a row . Tension affects athletes in various ways . Among other things , it slows down their mobility . From the opening game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play tennis , was noticeably slow getting to the ball , and so did n't have the time he normally does to get set for his shots . This might not have mattered if Tanner had not been in such magnificent form ; I ca n't remember his looking so formidable before . How well Tanner plays always depends basically on how well he serves . A supple left-bander from Lookout Mountain , Tennessee , he swings his racquet up and , with a snap of his strong left wrist , cracks the ball before it has reached the top of his toss and dispatches it like a huller . His serve has been timed at a hundred and forty miles an hour . Speed aside , it is difficult to pick up the ball anti follow it because Tanner hits it so early and with such a quick motion . On a good day , Tanner has always been a tough man to beat , but , as Bergelin put it , you expect him to serve well for three sets , and not for five sets , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another thing , Tanner had more than his big serve going for him . His backhand had never been much to worry about , since he invariably sliced it , but this year he had been working on a topspin backhand , and in the final he had it nicely under control . Furthermore , he had also arrived at a shrewd strategy for the match : he planned to come to net behind his first serve , and in the games that Borg served to attack whenever possible , dashing in and taking his chances on volleying Borg 's answering shots . Tanner executed this strategy exceedingly well . He seemed to he always at net , and , going all out for winners , he either won or lost most points when they had hardly begun . He seldom gave Borg the opportunity to play his game , which is to stay at the baseline and belt steaming drives off both wings until he forces his opponent into an error or passes him down the line if he ventures into the forecourt . Borg 's serve was off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the devil to get into the match and stay in it . In the fifth set , he at length got out in front , when he broke Tanner 's serve in the opening game . Both men held service in the next six games . The eighth game proved to be the critical one . Three errors by Borg put him down by 15-40 on his serve and gave Tanner two break points . Borg fought his way back to deuce , went to ad on an error by Tanner , and then won the game on a beautifully angled crosscourt forehand . That did it . In thinking back over the final , one realized that , what with Tanner scoring so often with his service and slapping placements here , there , and everywhere , it was the kind of match that anyone  --  even a Tilden , a Budge , a Gonzales , or a Laver  --  would ordinarily lose . Nine times out of ten , you simply can not stop a man playing as sensationally as Tanner , apparently touched by fate , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expending every last ounce of energy and resourcefulness and will power , and , as be nearly always manages to do , winning the big points . The fact that this was his fourth straight Wimbledon title carried immense significance , of course , but what stayed with you was the way he performed in the clutch . IN this literally golden age of tennis , 1 Borg 's achievements over the last half-dozen years have , as you would imagine , made him a wealthy man . A person who is in a position to know places his annual earnings at about three million dollars , and that is perhaps a conservative estimate . Tournament prize money accounts for a large part of his income , but I gathered from Robert Kain , of Mark McCormack 's International Management Group , which manages Berg 's business affairs , that the exhibition matches he plays from October through April  --  for fees of from thirty thousand to fifty thousand dollars per appearance  --  also add up to a substantial figure . Then , there is the revenue from tie-ins and endorsements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been affiliated with Scandinavian Airlines and with Saab , the Swedish automobile company . He will be renegotiating his already lucrative racquet contracts this autumn . in the United States , some of the products he endorses are a health drink , the Viking sewing machine , clothing by Fila , Tretorn tennis shoes ( which are made in Sweden ) , and the Ektelon racquet-stringing machine . He is also on retainer as the touring pro for Caesars Palace , in Las Vegas . In Europe , where Peter Worth supervises his deals for I.M.G. , he is associated with a line of games and toys , a candy bar , a soft drink , jewelry , keys and key chains , Diadora tennis shoes , and an inexpensive ball machine for hack-yard tennis practice . In Scandinavia , he endorses children 's notebooks and pencils , clothing by Jockey , a sweatband , and a Bjorn Borg headband . ( A company in Canada makes a different Bjorn Borg headband for sale over here . ) In Sweden , he has a line of casual shoes made by Tretorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Morinaga company . Coming up is a line of men 's cosmetics -- after-shave lotion , suntan lotion , talcum powder , and the like . All this covers the court pretty well , but I.M.G. has turned down many other requests for Borg to endorse products , on the ground that in those particular cases it would require too much of his time during the tournament season . Considering how well off he is , Borg does not live in a lavish manner . In 1974 , on the advice of I.M.G. , he moved his permanent residence from Sweden , which has one of the highest income-tax rates in the world , to Monaco , which has no income tax . He has an apartment there , in a building that also houses Bjorn Borg 's Sports Boutique , which is run by his father and mother , who live nearby . He plays ost of his tennis at the Monte Carlo Country Club . He likes Monaco , because the vest-pocket principality is so filed with movie stars , jet-setters , entertainers , and royalty that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1978 , Borg made another sizable purchase . He bought half of the island of KktilsO . Kattilsii gives him all the privacy he wants . To get there takes an hour 's drive from Norrkijping , a fairly big city south of Stockholm , and then a fifteen-minute trip by fast motorboat . Borg 's house is the only one on his half of KattilsO . It is an old-style two-story summer house right out of an Ingmar Bergman movie , The family that owns the other half of K  --  ttilsii has a nice summer house , and this is the extent of the building on the island . Borg goes there for three weeks of rest and recuperation in late July . Wimbledon is behind him then , and so is the Swedish Open , which is held at Ristad . Over a span of two and a half weeks , he sleeps and snoozes and lazes for hours at a dine . For a change of pace , he swims , water-skis , and fishes . ( He mostly catches pike . ) After those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin preparations for resuming life on the tournament circuit . He has had a hard-composition tennis court installed on Kat- and if Mariana is around he rallies with her . This summer , Billy Martin , a young American player , happened to be in Sweden for some tournaments , and he went over to Kiittilsd to work out with Borg and help him speed up the tempo of his training . In the future , Borg hopes to spend more than three weeks a year on the island , but that will probably have to wait . Other things will have to wait , too -- like skating . It is five or six years since he was last on the ice , and he misses it , HIS holiday behind him , Borg arrived in Toronto for the Canadian Championship on Friday , August 12th , accompanied by his fiancee and Bergelin . One reason he had chosen to come to Canada was that he wanted to get back into the swing of tournament tennis before playing in the United States Championship , which was to begin the last week in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University Tennis Center , on the outskirts of Toronto , are of the same hard-composition surface ( DecoTurf II ) as those at Flushing Meadow Park was a further inducement . Born arrived in Toronto the weekend before the start of the tournament . He is a diligent practicer , and on both Saturday and Sunday he spent two hours practicing with Gerulaitis in the morning and another two hours practicing with him late in the afternoon . He works harder during a practice session than most people do when they play . He watches the ball closely , moves to it East , and smacks it vigorously . He interrupts these workouts only long enough to drink some water . ( During a match , he drinks less water than when he practices . When he changes ends of the court at the odd games , he merely rinses his mouth with water . ) That weekend in Toronto , a number of qualifying matches had to he completed , and Borg and Gerulaitis sometimes had to wait for a court to open and sometimes had to shift to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , he was followed by a throng of admirers . His popularity had never been higher . Behind him on these moves walked Mariana , carrying a pitcher of water , paper cups , and some cans of Coca-Cola , and Bergelin came along a step or so behind , beaming his wide smile , with a couple of tennis racquets nestled in one arm and a couple of towels thrown over the other shoulder . ( Borg , by the way , uses a very heavy racquet , weighing fourteen and a half ounces . The grips on the handles of his racquets are about an inch and a half longer than is customary , so that he can have a little more room for his two-handed backhand . His racquets are strung to between seventy and eighty pounds of pressure  --  much tighter than any other player 's . He wants them this tight mainly because it enables him to get maximum velocity on his backhand . ) On that Saturday in Toronto , he wore a practice outfit that consisted of a blue-and-white T-shirt and some off-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sunday , he wore a light-blue T-shirt and tan shorts , Whereas Gerulaitis likes to chatter when he practices , Borg talks as little as he does when he is playing a match . Indeed , he makes it a point to approach his practice sessions just as he would a match , for that way , he believes , the things he does in practice are ultimately fully digested and become part of his repertoire . There are times when you can learn more about an athlete by watching him practice than by watching him in formal competition . Studying Burg 's movements as he practiced with Guru-bids at the York University Tennis Center , I became much more conscious than I had been before of how he is always poised on the balls of his feet , They must be very strong . So must his knees , for his balance depends on them . After each shot that he plays from the baseline , he takes a little hop to affirm his balance and his readiness . He also works extremely hard with his hips  --  especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his body is at a right angle to the net . This allows him to sling the racquet back into the ideal position as he prepares to play his two-fisted stroke . The power he gets on his backhand conies from the full release of his hips as he hits through the bail and into his pronounced follow-through . He is inclined not to take such a full preparatory turn on his forehand , and to hit the ball from a somewhat open stance , half facing the net . He has great strength in his right wrist , and on his forehand he does n't need as much assistance from his body . All these movements arc executed with such virtuosity that one forgets not only that Borg 's ground strok. ' s are basically unorthodox but also that it requires an athletic genius to play tennis the way he does . The foundation of his game is his footwork , unquestionably . When he moves well , he plays well . Borg 's mental discipline is , of course , an incalculable asset . As Bergelin sees it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so intensely on his tennis for long stretches , and not get stale , is his deep love of sports . He fel lows many sports closely , and he is deeply enthusiastic about the whole concept of sports . ( During my visit to Toronto , I spent quite a bit of time chatting with Bergelin , who can he highly diverting . One morning when a tennis coach of his vintage remarked on how much Borg and Mariana seemed to el-1j ? ) being together , Bergelin smiled and said , " Yes . I think they are hearing the same song . " He also has the amusing habit of frequently using " we " when he is answering questions about Borg . Late one afternoon , a woman asked him if Borg would be attending the party for the players that evening . Berge/in shook his head . " No , after this practice we will return to the hotel and take a shower , " he replied . " Then we will relax and take it easy , and later we will have dinner . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) Borg leads simple , uncomplicated life . Most of the players on the tour find him very likable , but few of them know him well , since he prefers to keep to himself in the evenings . There are exceptions to this regimen , though . For example , the night of his victory at Wimbledon this year he had dinner at the Inn on the Park ( Hyde Park ) with his mother and father , Mariana , Bergelin , and Bob Kain . Later , the party went on to Tramp , the " in " disco in London , and at four Borg was still going strong , drinking beer , dancing , and in general getting all the tensions that had accumulated over the championship fortnight out of his system . DURING the week of the Canadi- an Championship , Borg , playing increasingly stalwart tennis , was not threatened as he made his way to the final . There he met John McEnrne , the twenty-year-old whiz from Douglaston , Long Island , who in the autumn of 1978 had become the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did this in the semifinals of the Stockholm Open , and entered the Canadian Championship with a record of three victories in his five meetings with Borg . McEnroe , who darts around the court with the quickness of a water bug and has absolutely marvellous racquet control , had by that time replaced Connors as Borg 's most serious rival . Borg was pnmed for their match and , taking full advantage of the fact that McEnroe 's fearsome left-handed service was decidedly off that afternoon , won in straight sets , 6-3 , 6-3 . He spent the week between the Canadian Championship and the start of ours in and around New York . For the most part , he practiced with Gernlaitis on the court at the latter 's home , in Kings Point , Long Island , which now has a DecoTurf II surface . He also made an appearance in Central Park for the Vitas Gerulaiti.s Youth Foundation , which holds free tennis clinics for children in the New York area during the summer . Borg 's period of preparation had worked out nicely ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . His our concern was that he might have to pIal a match at night against a worrisome opponent . Most players do not like to play at night , but Borg , who feels that he does not sec the ball well in artificial light , has long made it known most emphatically that he thinks a major championship should not have both daytime and nighttime sessions , particularly after the fourth round . He stated this again in June . After that , he made no forthcr comment on the matter . Bergelin , however , did , frequently , and lie telephoned the men running our championship several times to request that Borg be scheduled to play his matches only in the daytime sessions . In his first-round match , Borg met Matt Mitchell , a former intercollegiate champion , and though his tennis was spotty , he raced through the three sets with the loss of only four games . He was sharper in every respect in defeating David Carter , a bearded young Australian , 6-1 , 6-1 , 6-1 , in the second round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Chile , 6-0 , 6-3 , 6-1 , in the third . No one looked for him to have much trouble in the next round , against Dick Stockton ; Stockton , you will remember , was his opponent when he had to retire because of a shoulder injury during their match in 1977 at Forest Hills . As it turned out , Borg easily could have lost to Stockton . Whereas Stockton played his best tennis of the year he varied his serve effectively , volleyed adroitly , and worked hard covering the court  --  Borg could not seem to get going . His passing shots were often wide , and he plain mis-hit a number of shots , the ball glancing off the wooden rim or the tightly strung face of his racquet and shooting in weird parabolas far out of court . His movements were sluggish , and , significantly , after the match he remarked that getting around on the DecoTurf II court was a chore : " You have to lift your legs all the time . You can not slide . " The scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they probably convey how lucky Borg was to sneak by Stockton . The general feeling was that now , having got his had match out of his system , he would begin to play his usual solid stuff as the tournament moved into the critical rounds . He would have to , in order to survive : his next opponent , in the quarter-finals , was Roscoe Tanner . The Borg-Tanner match took place under the lights on a black , starless night . The jets taking off from LaGuardia screeched low over the stadium . Borg got off shakily . He dropped his first service game , and when he dropped his serve again in the eighth game , there went the set , 6-2 . Tanner was patently at the top of his game . He was whacking his big first serve even faster than in the Wimbledon final  --  maybe as much as fifteen per cent faster . The cool night air may have accounted for this increased velocity , but , whatever the reason , the ball was a blur as it streaked into the service court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was taking Borg 's return of service  --  when Borg managed to return service  --  a step inside the baseline and punching very aggressive first volleys . He was hitting his ground strokes with immense confidence  --  a confidence that must surely have had something to do with his splendid performance against Borg at Wimbledon . At 3-3 in the second set , however , Tanner played a poor service game , in which he lost four points in a row , three of them on unforced errors . Borg went on from there to run nut the set , 6-4 , but he was still not playing anything remotely resembling his best tennis . A friend I was sitting with wondered if Borg could have been psyched out by his own assertions , and Bergelin 's , that under the lights he does not see the ball well . Possibly . Possibly not . One thing is certain : the last person anyone would want to face in a night match is Tanner . In the third set , Tan-a4 ner , serving sensational-ly , gained control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Borg 's movements seemed to he terri-bly slow , and one wondered whether this could have been caused by nervous-ness : after all , he had been working toward this championship for two months , and his chance for a Grand Slam hinged on his winning it . At this stage of the match , though , it was doubtful if Borg could manage one of his celebrated comebacks . He sim-ply was n't playing well enough . In the first game of the fourth set , he failed to seize a great opportunity . After getting to love-40 on Tanner 's service with two crisp forehands down the line and an error by Tanner , he Jost the next three points on errors ? and , ultimately , the game . Finally , when he trailed 2-5 in this set and all seemed hopeless , he staged a thrilling rally . He held his serve and then broke Tanner 's in the ninth game , in which Tanner was serving for the match . ( An uncommon incident took place after deuce was reached for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the net and broke the net cord . A new net was dragged onto the court and installed as fast as possible . Nevertheless , this operation took six or seven minutes , and when play was resumed Tanner , having lost his rhythm , had trouble get-ting his first serve in . ) Borg then held service to knot the set at 5-5 . The two men moved to 6-6 and into a tie breaker . It was Tanner all the way , seven points to two . Match to Tanner , 6-2 , 4-6 , 6-2 , 7-6 . He had played even better tennis than in the Wim-bledon final . His serve had been tre-mendous . He had racked up eleven aces ; seventeen other times , although Borg had got his racquet on Tanner 's serve , he was unable to return it . The fifth game of the final set was something to remember : after handcuffing Borg with his first serve to win the first point , Tanner had then fired three straight aces past him . Borg reached the interview room a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair on the platform . He was quiet and composed , and the only thing different about him that I noticed was that his irises were at the very top of his eyes , whatever that might signify . When Tanner arrived and began to answer the first barrage of questions , Borg listened to him most attentively . Tanner thought that a principal reason he had controlled the match was that he had served and volleyed better than at Wimbledon , while Borg had not served and volleyed as well . " This naturally increased the number of things I could do , " he said . Borg , when he spoke , agreed with this assessment . " Roscoe served very well from the start , " he said softly . " There was a lot of pressure on me. t knew I had to break Roscoe 's serve to get into the match , but when I had chances I made many errors . In a tie breaker , of course , anything can happen , but you saw how it went  --  Roscoe played some very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . " TN the semifinals , it was Tanner ver -- I- sus Gerulaitis in the upper half of the draw ( in the quarter-finals , Gerulaitis had been impressive in containing Johan Kriek , an exceedingly fast , proficient , and arrogant young South African ) , and in the lower half , as had been expected , it was Connors versus McEnroe . Tanner and Gerulaitis went on first . Theirs may have been the best match of the tournament . ( If it was n't , I think I would opt for one of four others : the battle in the fourth round between Tracy Austin and Kathy Jordan , in which Austin hung in there and won when she was down 5-6 and 15-30 in the third set ; the five-set shootout in the fourth round between Kriek and Yannick Noah , the charming young man who was discovered eight years ago in Cameroons by Arthur Ashei another hard-fought five-setter in the fourth round , between Pat Dupre and Harold Solomon ; and the beautifully played semifinal in the men 's doubles in which Stan Smith and Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fred Stolle . ) Gerulaitis , who , at twenty-five , is almost three years Tanner 's junior , is the son of a Lithuanian immigrant who was the tennis champion of the Baltic States in the years before the Second World War and now teaches the game on Long Island . A slim , fleet young man with a mane of curly blond hair , Gerulaitis is frequently referred to as the home pro at the Studio 54 disco , where he is a regular among regulars . In the past few years , during which he has won the Italian Championship twice and the Australian Championship once , he has more than held his own against nearly all the touring professionals except Borg and Connors . Together , they have beaten him a total of twenty-nine times in thirty matches . Gerulaitis lacks the attacking strokes to discomfit them . His first serve is unreliable , and his second serve is rather bland , although , under Stolle 's coaching , he has improved them in recent months . His ground strokes are not forcing enough : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have much bite to it . He also has a tendency to play his volleys too conservatively . These multiple shortcomings are ? visible against good , powerful players like Borg and Connors , but against most of the rest of the professional pack his exceptional speed afoot enables him to move into the forecourt behind only ordinary approach shots and to outmaneuver his opponents from that position . In four previous meetings with Tanner , for example , he had been the victor three times because of Tanner 's erratic play , but it should be noted that these matches took place in 1977 or earlier , and the Tanner he then faced was a much less substantial foe than the man who almost beat Borg at Wimbledon and beat him soundly at Flushing Meadow . - Dennis Ralston , who has been coaching Tanner , deserves much of the credit for his improved play this year . The new Tanner was the favorite to win this match , and he started out as if he would make short work of the job . He ran through the first two sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve whenever he needed it , and hitting fast , penetrating volleys . In the opinion of both players , the second game of the third set was the pivot , on which the match turned completely around . Two sets up and leading 1-0 in the third after breaking Gerulaitis in the opening game , Tanner let down a hit . This can be fatal in sports , and especially in racquet games . Once you diminish your purposefulness , your timing begins to wander , and often you can never regain it . Anyway , Tanner fell behind 15-40 in the second game and then double-faulted to lose it . This was the first time that Gerulaitis had broken Tanner 's serve , and naturally it encouraged him . Games followed service until 6-6 was reached . Gerulaitis then won a close tic breaker , seven points to five , and thus took the set , 7-6 . Tanner was now beginning to come apart . He had lost his rhythm on his ground strokes and his volley . He realized only too clearly that he had let Gerulaitis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming on strong made him tight and began to affect his serve . In addition , he was tired : Gerulaitis had from the start run down a lot of shots , and in the extended rallies that ensued Tanner had been made to expend a good deal of energy . As for Gerulaitis , he was now playing with much more confidence . He won the fourth set at 6-3 , and the fifth , and deciding , set also at 6-3 . In the last two sets , he did not once lose his service , and he dominated all but a few of the rallies . He had never before played anything like as authoritatively in our championships as he did in mounting this resolute comeback , and he left the court with the wonderful sound of prolonged applause ringing in his ears . Everyone had been waiting to see Connors versus McEnroe , for it brought together two players as combative as Kilkenny cats . Though there is no love lost between them , Connors and McEnroe genuinely respect each other 's ability . This year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each had won twice , but only after struggling hard and having to tap his emotional reserves . Connors , on his was ' to the semifinals , had lost onl ) one set , to Brian Gottfried . McEnroe , similarly , had lost onl ) one set , to Ilie Nastase . Nastase should never be scheduled for a night match , but he and McEnroe met under the lights , before a boisterous crowd that had obviously come not to watch a tennis match but to witness a brawl , an incident . Nastase is extremely talented at provoking incidents , and after he fell behind 1-2 in the fourth set and knew he could not win the match he tried to sabotage the proceedings by stalling and clowning , at one point sitting down on the court and stretching out . The crowd respondcd happily and noisily to his antics ; the umpire found that he could not restore order ; play had to be suspended and a new umpire summoned . A riot might have occurred if a detachment of police had not been called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on that ugly scene , it seems to me a case of reaping the whirlwind . Most of the people who run tournament tennis , in this country and other places , have over the last half-dozen years been far too lenient in letting players -- Connors and Nastase in particular get away with words and actions that have no place on a court . They have permitted this because they felt that it brought in spectators . It did  --  the wrong kind of spectators , the breed that goes to hockey games hoping for violence . They are not good for any sport , and certainly not for tennis . To be brief about it , the Connors-McEnroe match was a huge disappointment . After only a handful of games had been played , it was evident that Connors was not himself . Ordinarily , he comes full thrust his opponent , lambasting the ball with his flat , two-fisted backhand and his equally flat forehand , as though he would drive him into the clubhouse , if not into the sea . That day , however , Connors was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertiveness . His dreaded ground strokes were rather tame . More often than not , he was off balance when he hit them , and the ball seldom went where he . intended . Mc.Enroe won almost as he pleased-6-3 , 6-3 , 7-5 ? for in the course of those three sets Connors made no fewer than fifty-six unforced errors , an incredible number . After the match , rumors floated around the stadium that Connors had been bothered by a bad hack . The day before , he had complained to the tournament physician about back spasms and had been treated for them , but on the day of the match the doctor found nothing wrong when he examined him . All that one can say is that in ins match with McEnroe he did not play anything like as well as he ordinarily does . McEnroe is a solidly built athlete who stands five feet eleven and weighs a hundred and sixty pounds . He has a mop of curly brown hair , and on the court he wears a headband to keep it out of his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , is a left-hander , and he frequently behaves in an obstreperous manner . However , McEnroe approaches tennis the game itself  --  differently from the way Connors does . Connors has always tried to outgun the other man , to riddle him with the sheer power of his strokes . 141cEnroe can hit the ball hard , but he is fundamentally a touch player . When , after four defeats , he gained his first victory over Connors , this past winter , in the Masters tournament , he displayed an extraordinary ability to take the speed off Connors ' drives with his flexible wrist and waft hack soft shots that deprived Connors of the pee he thrives on . McEnroe tries to snake use of every inch of the court in order to insure the success of the shot he is setting up . Fin plc , after he has burned a shot deep into his opponent 's forehand or backhand corner he likes to feather a lazy drop volley j uSt over the net in the opposite direction . Whereas Connors ' mediocre ter ve has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has developed a first-class service that on occasion can be devastating . lie employs an odd stance on his serve : his right foot is set parallel to the baseline , and his left foot , toed out at about a thirty-five-degree Ingle , is positioned six or seven inches directly behind it . Since McEnroe stands facing the left sideline , you wonder when first you watch him how he is ever going to get the ball into the service boxes . No trouble at all : with his superlative . coordination , he makes a full turn of the hips , which releases a full turn of the shoulders , and that 's all there is to it . He is an intelligent server , who varies the speed and the spin of the ball . He is especially dangerous serving into the ad court , for he can bring in a fast slice serve at such an acute angle that his opponent is driven into the alley ( and sometimes beyond it ) to make the return , His ground strokes are orthodox and dependable . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McEnroe was up at net he seemed clearly beaten when Connors hit a bullet down the line a yard and a half to his right . McEnroe , who had been expecting Connors to gn crosscourt , spun his body around to the right , and not only reached the ball with a List-second lunge but also got his wrist into position to angle the hall hack inches over the net . 14IcEnroe 's court manner is not as elegant as his game . I am not talking about his chronic pouting or his other sour expressions . They do not make him an attractive figure , but they are simply his way of registering displeasure with himself after he has misplayed a shot or a point , and he is entitled to react however he chooses to his own play . What is unfortunate is his proclivity for bitterly contesting the calls made by the officials during his matches . He acts as if he , and he alone , is able to see where the ball actually lands . To make matters worse , he sometimes uses abusive language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he is not above lecturing the umpire magisterially . His general petulance and rudeness are difficult to understand , for McEnroe is an intelligent young man  --  he attended Stanford for a year before turning professional  --  and his father is a member of a well-known New York law firm . This year , in the Queens Club tournament in London , just before Wimbledon , McEnroc 's behavior was so outrageous that the British press dubbed him Superbrat and went at him en masse . Their harsh criticism got through to McEnroc , and it seemed to have a beneficial effect on him . He conducted himself well at Wimbledon and , for the most part , in the weeks afterward . At Flushing Meadow , though , he was far too brash on several occasions , He baited Nastase early in their match , for no good reason . In his semifinal with Connors , he became incensed when the umpire did not agree that a first serve of his had been out  --  Connors had returned it for a winner  --  and he thereupon called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the serve was in . McEnroe , it appears , does not understand his position and its responsibilities . He acts as if he were still a boy chivying his friends and enemies in the schoolyard . At twenty , he is not too young to appreciate that prominent athletes appearing in public have an obligation to the game they play , and presumably love , and that it is incumbent upon them to respect their opponents and the game itself , for otherwise they make a travesty of the whole idea of sport . It is to he hoped that McEnroe will soon realize this , for he is not just another athlete . He is probably the most gifted young American tennis player to come along since Pancho Gonzales , and he has a chance to become one of the greatest players in the history of tennis . In the final , McEnroe defeated Gerulaitis 7-5 , 6-3 , 6-3 . There was only one moment when he was not completely in command . This came when , leading 5-4 , he was serving to close out the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game by playing three excellent shots ? a crosscourt forehand for a clean placement , an incisive volley , and a strong forehand that McEnroe volleyed over the baseline . In the very next game , however , Gerulaitis threw away what he had gained when he double-faulted twice and lost his service . After that , McEnroe gave him few openings . On the brink of his first victory in a major championship , he suffered a slight attack of nervousness , but he gathered himself together and served out in style . McEnroe , whose twentieth hirthdai came in February , is the youngest player to win our championship since 1948 , when it was won by Gonzales , whe had turned twenty in May of that year . An even younger player won our women 's singles championship Trac Austin , from Rolling Hills , California , who celebrated her sixteenth birthdat last December . Miss Austin is , in fact ? the youngest player ever to capture our women 's title . Maureen Connolly- , had held that distinction , was sonic three months older when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three consecutive championships . Miss Austin 's achievement is worthy of detailed study , but at present it will have to suffice to sa ) that , following her close cal against Kathy Jordan in the fourth round , she played superb tennis . In the semifinals , she upset Martina Navratilova , the Wimbledon champion , 7-5 , 7-5 , by being the more aggressive when it counted . in the final , against Chris Even-Lloyd , who was seeking to win our women 's championship a fifth straight year , she outsteadied the classic baseliner from the baseline and was far less tentative playing the crucial points . The scores were 6-4 , 6-3 . Miss Austin is going to get bigger and stronger and faster and possibly even more assured in the years ahead , and if the improves her serve  --  her one weakness  --  it will take nothing less than a brilliant performance to heat het- . TN his press conference at the dose of the tournament , John McEnroe was asked if he thought his march through the field at Flushing Meadow entitled him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bjorn Borg is the No. 1 player , " he replied , in his rat-tat-tat delivery , after giving the question hardly a moment 's thought . " Borg is the bust player on grass , and he 's also the best on clay . Our only chance to beat him right now is on this surface here . " On the morning after his loss to Tanner , Borg spent a couple of hours talking business in his hotel suite with Bob Kain , the I.M.G. representative he works with . Kain found him not only calm and stoic but in rather good spirits . That afternoon , Borg and Bergelin flew to Stockholm . Coming up the next week was an important Davis Cup match against Czechoslovakia in Prague , and Borg was eager to begin preparing for it as soon as possible . No one has to tell him how tough Tanner can be on his day , how good McEnroe is already , or that youth must be served . A realistic young man , he has known these facts of life for some time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ambition , Borg , I would guess , feels t hat if he continues to be industrious and perceptive about his tennis he should be able to stay at the top a few more years at least . Then he can think about Kittilsii.
