After coaching his student for three years , Voice Teacher Frederick Wilkerson took a deep breath and gave her his verdict : as a classical artist , she would make a good pop performer . Many young singers would have been demolished . Not Roberta Flack . Always fascinated with pop music , she took the advice , began lightening and loosening her Puccini-style soprano , soon was singing and playing piano for $20 a night at Mr. Henry 's , a jazz joint in the Capitol Hill district of Washington , D.C. Her toughest adjustment was to the audiences , who were literally a far cry from politely attentive classical listeners . " Can we have a little quiet at Table Five , please ? " Roberta would call out hopefully . Sometimes she would flee to her dressing room , vowing tearfully not to return to the bandstand until the clatter subsided . " I 'd tell her to go on back out , " recalls Wilkerson . " ' Some day they 'll listen , ' I 'd say . " <P> Today they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording of The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face has been the bestselling single in the country , and the album containing that song , First Take , has been the No. 1 LP . Roberta has also become a top concert attraction . Warbling her way thoughtfully through the soul classic Ai n't No Mountain High Enough or Bob Dylan 's Just Like a Woman , her head thrown straight back or tilted lazily to one shoulder , she can be sedate enough to appear with Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops-as she did two weeks ago . Or she can burst with the full flavor of Southern blues , as in Eugene McDaniels ' Reverend Lee , which she introduced recently to a Denver audience thus : " Lemme paint this picture clearly . This is about a big , strong , black , sexy pause , potbellied , Southern Baptist minister , who like all men had a master plan for the ladies . " <P> Emotional Secret . Roberta is a balladeer who blends jazz , pop and the blues in a way that recalls Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Sinatra set as much as the jazz buffs , to the over-40s as much as their rock-bopping offspring . Her secret is that emotionally , she banks her fires . She knows that a low flame burns longer and more intriguingly than a high blaze . Thanks to her training , her voice retains a classical elegance , avoiding the frenzied bleating that characterizes so much pop singing today . <P> " Everything I 've ever done has been with just one idea , " says Roberta . " Whatever it was , I told myself , ' This is it . ' " She took everything slow and steady , step by step . While she was growing up in Arlington , Va. , her father worked as a draftsman and her mother as a public school cook who played organ at a local church . By the time she was nine , Roberta was playing for the Sunday school ; at age eleven she was sitting in for Mom at the 11 o'clock service . She entered Howard University on a partial music scholarship at 15 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools . After school she would rush home for a nap , then play at Mr. Henry 's Georgetown branch until 2 a.m.
