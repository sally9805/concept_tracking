The order is set forth clearly in The U.S. Fighting Man 's Code , which is issued to all U.S. servicemen . An American prisoner of war must " continue to resist by any means available , " and " obey the lawful orders " of senior U.S. officers in the P.O.W. camp in which he finds himself imprisoned . Last week the senior officer at one of those camps in North Viet Nam , Air Force Colonel Theodore W. Guy , filed charges with the Defense Department calling for courts-martial of eight former P.O.W.s - none of them from the Air Force , and all enlisted men . <P> Colonel Guy 's F-4 fighter-bomber was shot down over Laos in 1968 , and he was imprisoned in the " Plantation Gardens , " a camp on the outskirts of Hanoi . Guy , 44 , a stiff-backed professional officer , was appalled by what he found : more than 100 polyglot prisoners , Americans and others , civilians and servicemen . Though he was held in solitary much of the time . Guy issued orders by tapping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture or duress , had been cooperating with the enemy by making antiwar statements were told to taper off and eventually to desist completely . <P> Yet eight men , * according to Guy and other former prisoners , continued to make statements and otherwise collaborate . Guy asserts that these men failed to adhere to the code of conduct , undermined efforts of fellow prisoners to set up an organization , and sought the cooperation of their fellow prisoners in collaboration . As a result , they allegedly secured favors-including beer , peanuts and popcorn , and trips to Hanoi . Guy said that partly because " certain people talked , " he was beaten by guards- " I had some teeth knocked out and I had my stomach muscles kicked loose . " All eight of the men he has accused , said Guy , disrupted his command by failure to cooperate , and also by revealing what he was doing to organize the prisoners and by running their own counter-organization . <P> Forgive and Honor ? Many former P.O.W.s and their wives voiced approval of the pressing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had urged Guy not to do so . The Secretaries of the Army and the Navy will now decide whether the charges merit courts-martial . <P> Most of the accused themselves expressed surprise on hearing of the charges ; at least two of them voiced public denials . They had relied on former Defense Secretary Melvin Laird 's promise to " forgive and honor " returned P.O.W.s . Two men had been taking steps to reenlist , until Guy 's charges hit them . One of these men , Private Frederick Elbert of Brentwood , L.I. , made a telling remark : " Colonel Guy has been through a hell of a lot-and so have the rest of us . " <P> <P> * Three Marines : Sergeant Abel Kavanaugh , Staff Sergeant Alfonso Riate and Private Frederick Elbert ; and five Army men : Specialist Four Michael P. Branch , Staff Sergeant Robert Chenoweth , Staff Sergeant James A. Daly Jr. , Staff Sergeant King Rayford Jr . and Staff Sergeant John A. Young .                @ @ @ @ @
