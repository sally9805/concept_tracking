LIKE small-town America itself , the independent local bank has been fading away in many parts of the country , overcome by progress and competition from rich , efficient multibranch banking firms that are headquartered in big cities . In recent years , despite some Government constraints on bank expansions , the spread of large institutions to the suburbs and small towns has substantially quickened , investing major banks with ever more financial clout and raising howls from small bankers . As a result , the old arguments over how banking can best serve the economy and the public have burst into a controversy that will soon reach the Supreme Court and the Congress . <P> In the last quarter-century the number of U.S. banks has shrunk from 14,759 to 13,000 . Today the top 100 largest hold 54% of all commercial deposits , up from 48% seven years ago . In California , where banks can open branches anywhere , eight companies own 2,469 of the state 's 3,126 banks ; the Bank of America alone has 1,001 . Forbidden by state law to set up branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan and First National City are buying up institutions in the state through their bank holding companies . In Missouri , bank holding companies are acquiring small banks at a rapid rate and now have more than 50% of deposits , v. 15% three years ago . <P> The decline in the economies of many urban areas is also pushing large city banks into the suburbs . " The profitability of the seven largest banks in New York City , excluding their international operations , is at best mediocre , " says Edward G. Webb , a vice president of Manhattan 's Irving Trust Co . <P> With scant evidence to back their argument , independent bankers charge that absentee-owned branch banks , left unchecked , will wipe them out , dominate the country 's economy and put profit above personal service and the local community 's needs . They contend that society is healthier when control of credit is as diffuse as possible . John Harris , president of Callaway Bank of Fulton , Mo. , asks : " If you were a holding company bank and money was tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Boonville or your big corporate customer ? " Adds Allen Stults , past president of the American Bankers Association : " Big banks may be more efficient , but is that all we want ? After all , the most efficient form of government is a dictatorship . " <P> The chiefs of big branch banks counter that in providing competition in small towns they not only improve the efficiency of community banks but also offer residents a wider array of services , like computerized checking and often cheaper loan rates . Small banks can also be autocratic monopolies . James M. Kemper Jr. , chairman of Commerce Bancshares Inc. of Kansas City , Mo. , recalls : " As we moved into areas dominated by one bank , we found that in two towns the independents refused to offer even savings-account services . Now the townsfolk have the opportunity to earn interest on their savings . " The most serious argument against small banks is that they frequently do not have the capital to meet the needs of individual and corporate borrowers in suburbs and growing rural areas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
