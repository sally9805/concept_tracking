THE TALI ( OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment TOOTLE POINDEXTER . DO you know Tootle Poindexter , the fun Australian designer who made such a hit on Seventh Avenue last fall with his new line of hand-blocked Paisley earmuffs ? No matter . Nice fellow . We saw him a few hours ago while we were out crashing our way about Fifth Avenue . He was wearing his new boarhide hunting jacket and what seemed to be a pair of canvas trousers . " Canvas ? " we asked . " Yes , of course , " he said . " Afrikaner Stalking Trousers . Try Bloomingdale 's . " Later , we ran into Lamar Tremblay , the novelist , wearing a pink safari suit ; Francis Farraday , the poet , in his General Franco Tank Commander 's coat and Wrangler jeans ; and Treadway Billings , the car-rental executive , in a new pigskin whaling ensemble . And we glimpsed in the distance what certainly seemed to be Ambrose Mound , the verse dramatist , wafting down Fifty-seventh Street in a mixture of Panzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Italian velour himberjackets . Clearly , we are into a trend here ; we are well into a- trend . Do you remember , just a scant two or three years ago , when women were telling their husbands , " Go ahead . Be a sport . Buy that necktie with the purple ravioli design on the electric. - blue background " ? Do you remember when people said , " Is n't it wonderful about Fred and his disgusting new shirts  --  I mean , the way he 's discovered color ? " Do you remember when people spoke about the " revolution " in men 's clothes ? Doubtless they still do . We are here to report that the revolution is with us , has passed over , is consolidating  --  and takes the form of Tootie Poindexter in his boarhide hunting jacket and Afrikaner Stalking Trousers , and of everybody else in his Ingmar Bergman Weekend with a Gloomy Architect leather jacket and cowpuncher jeans and How I Built Hoover Dam work clothes and God knows what else . In fact , on most afternoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striding around in inconspicuous Viking leather outfits are the F.B.I . people , in their evidently just purchased ( probably from some Panamanian wholesaler ) Ivy League suits -- trailing the new Red Chinese air attachs , in their just purchased ( probably from the same wholesaler ) white button-down shirts and Tattersall vests . So he it , we say . A country that invented the pork-pie hat , the two-trouser suit , and the Can I Kiss You in the Dark Baby necktie surely needs a little time to relax before embarking on yet another course of native creativity . Only the other day , we saw a big ad in Life for some new Swedish Army officers ' coats  --  at least , we assumed they were new . " With all the authentic features ! " the ad said . " The style is really now .... $29.95 . " We have been scanning our old jacket more and more frequently in the hallway mirror  --  a casual , manly scanning , mind you . None of that fussing around . None of that tugging at things , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a quite splendid jacket . A bit on the worn side , perhaps . A bit loose . Comfortable is what we prefer to call it . On the other hand , that Swedish Army officer 's jacket does n't look so bad . All the authentic features , too . Ghostly white shapes gliding silently out from the tree line . Skis . Automatic weapons . Unmoving blue eyes . The Mannerheim Line . No , that was Finland . The defense of 11,1alm . Ingmar Bergman country . Ingmar Bergman and his leather jackets against the Swedish Army officers ' coats . Caesar Augustus . Max von Sydow . The line extends , white shapes invisible against the snow . The officer raises his sword , his ski , his flag , his tow ticket . Across the frozen chasm , only one man remains  --  Tootie Poindexter . " A vanti ! " the officer calls  --  a trainee from the south . A hail of grapeshot and ski wax fills the air . Poindexter tries to rise , to turn , to flee , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will take the advertisement home . We will study it . $29.95 . Not bad . Still , it does n't pay to rush into this sort of thing . Totem IN a wooded corner of the Princeton campus , standing in the embrace of two brownstone wings of the university 's art museum but surrendering not a jot of its exuberant identity to them , is a huge concrete statue of a woman 's head . It is recognizable at once as a Picasso , and , indeed , it is called , like so many of Picasso 's works , " Tfte de Femme . " In its original version , it is of brightly painted sheet metal , twelve and a half inches in height and weighing perhaps ten or twelve pounds ; in the present version , completed a few days after Picasso 's ninetieth birthday , it is sixteen feet high and twelve feet wide and weighs a good ten or twelve tons . The sculptor who , with Picasso 's ardent encouragement , has performed the feat of turning a pretty toy into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is also a painter , a documentary moviemaker , a scene designer , and a still photographer . Mr. Nesjar carves in concrete according to a technique known as Naturbetong , which was developed by an Oslo friend of his , the architect Erling ViksjiL The technique consists of packing a wooden form full of crushed stone  --  in this case , specially ground-up pebbles of Norwegian red quartzite and black granite  --  and then forcing liquid concrete among the pebbles under high pressure . Once the concrete has bonded the stone , the form is removed and the sculptor carves the concrete by sandblasting its " skin , " thereby exposing the aggregate underneath . The head at Princeton is a polychrome of red , black , and cream ) white ; new as it is , it looks as if it had stood there for a thousand years , shedding benign magic over all passe rsby . The day we visited the " Tete , " Mr. Nesjar , dressed in an astronaut-style outfit of rubber gloves , jacket , and mask , was up on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet of sand . ( The jet issues from a hose at a pressure of a hundred pounds , and if it is misdirected its force is sufficient to slice through a man 's arm ; sculptors who carve in concrete must have strong physiques and steady nerves . ) Catching sight of us , Mr. Nesjar turned the hose over to his helper , a fellow-Norwegian named Sigurd Frager , and invited us to sit with him outside a little portable aluminum workshed while he described his long and fortunate collaboration with Picasso . They met in 1956 , in the South of Fiance , and when Nesjar showed Picasso some photographs of experiments he had been making with the Naturbetong technique , the old man hounded up out of the depths of a chair and rushed into the kitchen to explain the technique to the cook , then outdoors to explain it to the gardener . " As always , he immediately saw the possibilities in a new method of creating art , " Mr. Nesjar said . " He gave me three designs , unsigned , for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Oslo . Later , when he saw photographs of the finished work , he took back the designs , signed them , and handed them to me . That was both his official imprimatur and his way of thanking me . Since then , I 've executed about fifteen Picasso works , either from originals in other forms or from his designs and maquettes . In ' 63 , I did an engraved mural eighty feet long for the Chateau de Castille , at Gard , in France , and in ' 65 I did a group of four sculptures called ' The Picnic on the Grass ' for the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm . Three years ago , I did the thirty-eight-foothigh statue Sylvette ' for the plaza JANUARY $ , 1972 of the N.Y.U. apartment buildings south of Washington Square . Picasso takes a close interest in my work and makes very useful suggestions . " Mr. Nesjar showed us a photograph of a scale model he had made of " Tete de Femme . " On the model were scratched sonic zigzag lines . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently wanted to add a little life to the surfaces . " " The de Femme " was commissioned as part of the Putnam Sculpture Collection at Princeton  --  a group of outdoor works by leading contemporary sculptors , including Henry Moore , Louise Nevelson , Alexander Calder , and David Smith . The collection is financed by an anonymous gift of roughly a million dollars and is named in memory of Lieutenant John B. Putnam , Jr. , Princeton ' 4-5 , who died in the Second World War . The university having officially accepted the " Tete , " Mr. Nesjar now intends to devote his time to the design and construction of something he calls " ice fountains ! ' " In my home country , ordinary fountains have to be shut down much of the year because of the cold , and this is true even in New York , " he said . " I 'm working on a way to keep fountains flowing all year round and to let the ice that forms on them become a series of constantly changing shapes and patterns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same fountain twice . I call my designs a blending of light , ice , and water , and I 'm eager to get Picasso 's opinion of them . Ice fountains make no sense in the South of France , but Picasso 's imagination reaches from Pole to Pole , and he 's sure to see something in them that I have n't seen . " Festival A REPORT from a young man who attended the Eighth Annual Ncw York Avant-Garde Festival : " It is important to have a grasp of the geography of the thing . The basic geography was simple : Manhattan ; Lexington Avenue and Twenty-sixth Street ; the old 69th Regiment Armory . The interior geography was more complex . A diagram would help , but I ca n't draw . You might make one of your own from these simple instructions : Draw a large rectangle to represent the interior of the Armory . At one end , indicate a door . At the other , draw a clock and underneath it put the legend ' Next Home Game . ' The clock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armory people ; everything else I describe belongs to the Avant-Garde Festival people . To the right of the clock , draw a Ferris wheel  --  a big Ferris wheel . To the left of the Ferris wheel ( and a hit toward the door end of the rectangle ) , write Nixon Ensemble , ' and a bit to the left of that draw a mound of dirt , a young man in a tailcoat , and a few white mice . Moving toward the door end of things , render three or four giant inflatable polyps , and to the left of the polyps draw a few score cardboard sculptures of Batman . Your diagram ought now to be complete except for the areas flanking the door . To the right , indicate the existence of a Baby Grand Guitar , and to the left write the words ' Happy Birthday Charlotte . ' Around your completed diagram , make many symbols for static . The static symbols will remind you not to forget the four hundred holing videotape exhibits on the periphery . " Now , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and giant inflatable polyps have been , after all , absolutely standard for years . I want to zero in on the mound of dirt and on ' Happy Birthday Charlotte . ' You see , when I go to Avant-Garde Festivals , I go with the idea of bestowing little mental prizes on deserving exhibits . Usually , I look for something that Breaches the Boundaries of Art As We Know It , but the boundaries of art as we know it have been hard to find of late , so this year I decided to look for the Artist Who Tried Hardest . Hence my interest in the young man in tails and ' Happy Birthday Charlotte ' " I spent a long time looking at the young man in tails . He was lying almost perfectly still on a little black cloth on top of the mound of dirt . The mound was cordoned off by the standard red vinyl rope . People stood at the rope and watched him . A small sign said that what they were watching was ' Ring Piece ' and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impossible to absolutely determine whether Geoff Hendricks  --  the creator of the piece  --  and the man in tails were one and the same , but this was the popular assumption . It was not possible to get to the bottom of it because the young man in tails on the mound of dirt did not talk at all . What he did do was make notes from time to time in a little notebook . And he gave full territorial rights over his body and his mound of dirt to several white mice who happened to he there . Although the young man was not active , it seemed to me that he was trying hard . " The people involved in ' Happy Birthday Charlotte ' were active . They were constructing a giant birthday cake . These people were Joe Millions , who is the proprietor of Colossal Cakes , and Milton Summers , who is , according to Mr. Millions , the greatest cake decorator in the world . The enormous cake had three layers , but only the topmost layer ( which measured two feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dummies . All three layers were being decorated by Mr. Summers . He had written ' Happy Birthday Charlotte ' all over the cake , because it was for Charlotte Moorman , who organizes the Avant-Garde Festival . " I talked to a girl who said that the young man 's white mice were n't his white mice at all but , rather , belonged to an artist/event-stager named Dick Higgins . ' The mice just split from Dick and stayed on the mound of dirt , ' the girl said . I went to investigate . I stood behind the cordon and watched the young man in tails some more . He had a long beard , so I could not see whether he was wearing the proper sort of wing collar . Certainly he was wearing the proper sort of shoes black pat-ent-leather ones . Then a guy in a black-hooded costume and dark glasses , who carried with him a sound effect like a muffled siren and also a Charlie McCarthy puppet , came up to where I was standing . He gave me a little puzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . Then I got up my nerve and asked the young man in tails out loud if his white mice were really his mice or if they were Dick Higgins ' mice . He did not answer , but he did make a little notation in his notebook . Then the guy in the hooded costume with the siren sound effect and the Charlie McCarthy puppet came back and gave me a secand puzzle/object . I left before I grew to depend on his kindness . " Everywhere 's Somewhere John Lennon Yoko Ono New York City are your people . John Lennon Yoko Ono New York City is your friend . ? Dawd Peel and Me Lower East Side . SOME good local news , for a change : John Lennon and his wife and co-worker , Yoko Ono , have become , for most practical purposes , New Yorkers . They have been living here more or less continuously for the past six months ; they have rented a studio in the West Village to live in and a loft in SoHo to work in ; they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bicycles in the Park , going to the movies in the middle of the night , and picking up the Sunday papers in Sheridan Square . So far , they have not been heard to complain that the city is unlivahle . When that happens , well know that they 're here to stay . On a recent Saturday , we went down to the West Village to see for ourself how they are getting along in their new home . A long-haired retainer opened the door and steered us toward a curtain in the rear . We ducked through it , into what is surely one of the pleasantest rooms in town . It is a studio in the old , romantic way  --  high-ceilinged , with serrated skylights , trees outside the windows , and a cast-iron circular stairway , painted muddy green , leading to the roof . The walls are heige , trimmed in the same muddy green . There was a relaxed dishevelment  --  piles of clothing , electronic equipment , a guitar , magazines in English and Japanese . The only uncluttered horizontal surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room like the stage in a theatre-in-the-round . A television set , picture on , sound off , perched at the foot a prompter 's box . John Lennon , wearing jeans and a blue tank top , sat cross-legged on the bed . He was a trifle smaller than we had expected , his skin was ruddier , his hair was fairer , but his face was as familiar as an old friend 's . Yoko , dressed in green , lounged beside him . We pulled up a chair . " Why did you choose New York to live in ? " we asked . " We love it , and it 's the center of our world , " John said . " It 's the first international city , race-wise , if you think about it , " Yoko said . " It has more Jews than Tel Aviv . " " And more Irish than Dublin , " John said . " And blacks , and Chinese , and Japanese , and they 're all living pretty well together , " Yoko said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art world and in the general society . Even the most intelligent people in New York are saying , ' Oh , nothing is happening in New York . It 's boring . Let 's all go to the West Coast . ' That was the general tenor when we got here . ' We 're sort of trying to change the wind to a more positive wind . " " I think all of us went through a big depression in the last year and a half , all over the world , " John said . " We think there 's something in the air that 's going to pick us all up again . You know , New York is a fantastic place . Yoko is a New Yorker . She spent fifteen years here before she met me , and she used to go on about New York to me all the time , but I had never really seen it. I was overwhelmed by America in the early days when the Beatles were here , because we were all brought up on Americana . Britain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother country of the whole culture . There 's an unbelievably creative atmosphere on this little island of Manhattan . Like they say , there just is n't anything you ca n't get in New York . " " It 's a very rich island , " Yoko said solemnly . " It has everything you could possibly want , night and day . That 's what I ca n't stand about England and Europe : it closes down , unless you go to Ham burg or Amsterdam for the night-club scene , which I do n't enjoy . But New York never sleeps . " " If you had all the money in the world and you were in Spain or somewhere , what could you do with it ? " said 4 ( Yoko . " Here there 's no end to it . " " In a way , it 's better to he poor in New York than rich in Spain or England , " John said . " Exactly , exactly , " Yoko said . " I was an artist cum waitress cum lecturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was the superintendent of the building Jerry Rubin 's living in now , " John said . " Jerry took us to sec it , and it turned out to be a place where Yoko was superintendent ten years ago . " " I was fired , " Yoko said , and she laughed . " One night , I was having a concert at Carnegie Recital Hall , and I forgot to turn the incinerator on . All the garbage was stuck , and two days later I burned it , and the smoke was everywhere , and the Fire Department came , and I was fired . I was a waitress and a cook in a macrobiotic restaurant  --  the Paradox . The critics would come to interview me about my concerts . " " She 'd serve ' em macro and then sit down with ' em and talk about her art , " John said . " I thought I was a very rich person then , because this city has that quality , that even a waitress can feel rich about it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fate here . Your fate is what you create in this city . " IVe said that the talk of riches reminded us of a recent song of John 's , " Imagine , " which asks the listener , among other things , to " imagine no possessions . " " I wish ' Imagine ' would come true , " John said . " I 've been listening to it myself , because I get an objective view after , and I was imagining . I began to think : I do n't want that big house we built for ourselves in England . I do n't want the bother of owning all these big houses and big cars , even though our company , Apple , pays for it all . All structures and buildings and everything I own will be dissolved and got rid of . I 'll cash in my chips , and anything that 's left I 'll make the best use of . Yoko is a three-tatami woman , and she 's been working on me to get rid of this possessions complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor like myself  --  not starving but poor . " We asked Yoko about her three tatami , and she said , " One tatami is the length and width of a person lying down . A friend of mine in Tokyo says that in today 's society , with its overpopulation , the natural space that a person can acquire without fighting or making unnatural efforts is three tatami  --  one for himself to lie down in , a second for his companion , and a third for them both to breathe in . There is a kind of poverty where you have an excess of things , and all your energy is directed toward getting and keeping them . John was poor , and it was natural for him to strive for wealth , but I come from a background of excessiveness . It was very natural for me to live in New York in a bohemian way , because I was trying to get away from that . " John was still preoccupied with his possessions . " It 's clogging my mind just to think about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books and possessions . Walls full of books I 've collected all my life . I have a list this thick of the things I have in Ascot , " Chuck , what 's it when there are like two unknowns and the base pair are minus numbers and something and something ? " and I 'm going to tick off the things I really want , really need . The rest goes to libraries or prisons  --  the whole damn lot . I might keep my rock-and-roll collection , but even that I 'm thinking about . " " Everything you 've got in here looks like something you use , " we said . " Yes , it 's very casual , " Yoko said . " If we lost everything in here , we might he annoyed , but not to the point where it would affect our health . I like the idea of everything being transient , so that all that is with me is somebody I love and myself . " We asked the Lennons how they liked their new neighborhood , and Yoko said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quaint little town . " " Yes , it 's like a little Welsh village , with Junes the Fish and Jones the Milk , and everybody seems to know everybody , " John said . " People do n't grab us when we walk in the Village , " Yoko said . " They sort of smile from a distance , which is nice . " " We stand out more in Britain than in America as a mixed-marriage cou ple , " John said . " Although there is race hatred in America , you see more different-colored people in America than in Britain . " " Even the white people are different colors here , " we said . " Yes , there are all shades , all different kinds of descent , " he said . " In England , everybody south of Calais is a Wog , and that includes the French and the Italians . " " John has a New York temperament in his work , " Yoko said . " Liverpool is very much like New York , for an English city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got on the boat to come over here , and the same for the Jews and the blacks , " John said . " The slaves were brought to Liverpool and then shipped out to America . On the river front in Liverpool you can still see the rings in the side where they were chained up . We got the records  --  the blues and the rock  --  right off the boats , and that 's why we were advanced musically . In Liverpool , when you stood on the edge of the water you knew the next place was America . " The sun was setting , and the television set glowed more brightly . On the screen , a gigantic lizard was crunching Times Square underfoot . " Do you like watching television without the sound ? " we asked . " TV to me is like what the fireplace used to he , " John said . " You always get these Surreal things happening . I used to watch the fire as a child , but since they took the fire away from us , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window only this picture continually changes . You 'll see China and the moon , all in ten minutes . You 'll see real , Surreal , strange , pmchedelic  --  every thing . " ' We got up to go , and said goodbye to Yoko . John walked us to the door , peered out cautiously , and came out on the stoop with its for a moment . " Everywhere 's somewhere , and every-where 's the same , really , and wherever you are is where it 's at , " he said . " But it 's more so in New York . It does have sugar on it , and I 've got a sweet tooth . "
