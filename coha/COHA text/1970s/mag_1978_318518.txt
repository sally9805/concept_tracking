A record order heralds a new generation of superjets <P> Like competing suitors seeking the dowry of a fabled heiress , the major planemakers for months have been courting United Airlines . Salesmen from Lockheed , McDonnell Douglas , Boeing-each carrying special pleas and promises-swarmed to the company 's Chicago headquarters . There was also a fascinating newcomer on the scene , the European Airbus consortium . Reason for the wooing : United , the free world 's largest airline , was preparing to place the first big order for the new generation of supersophisticated jetliners on whose fleet wings air travelers will fly into the 21st century . <P> Last week United made its choice , and the winner was Boeing . <P> At a cost of $1.2 billion , United will take 30 767s , twin-engine , wide-bodied jets that so far exist only as models in a wind tunnel . The new plane , designed to fill the gap between the long-range jumbos and short-range feeder planes , will be in the air by mid-1982 , carrying 197 passengers on trips of 500 to 2,200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two huge engines hanging from thinner , longer wings . Because of its advanced aerodynamics and improved engines , it will be quieter , more comfortable and some 35% cheaper to operate than the present generation of aging jets . Even so , because the 767 is so expensive ( around $25 million , not counting spares and support equipment ) , United also bought 30 advanced versions of the popular 727 , for $400 million . <P> At $1.6 billion , United 's orders are by far the largest transaction in aviation history . But they are only the beginning , and they affect far more than just the airlines . Aircraft sales abroad are one of the U.S. 's largest export items , and without them the nation 's trade balance would suffer disastrously . Plane sales are also a matter of national pride , and for the first time ever , the U.S. 's dominance of civil aviation is being seriously challenged by European governments , which are pressing their state-owned airlines to buy jets made by their own industries . Until the United purchase of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European Airbus , at present the only wide-bodied , twin-engine jetliner with short-to-medium range . <P> Now the race is on . Within days , or at most weeks , other airlines will have to start placing orders to secure favorable delivery positions . Ultimately , the non-Communist world 's 100 lines are expected to buy some 2,000 medium-range and 3,000 long-range jets . The bill : at least $70 billion .
