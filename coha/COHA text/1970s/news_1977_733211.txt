txt Letters Letters C.I.A. : ' A Cure Worse Than the Disease ' To the Editor : Like many other citizens , I have been shocked to the point of numbness by each succeeding wave of revelation of the legion of illegal and amoral acts of responsible Federal Government agencies and officials . These waves had never touched me in my person or in my work . Last Thursday 's New York Times , however , struck home ! I suddenly learned that the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology , from which I and my colleagues successfully sought financial support for our research in the late 50 's and early 60 's , was set up and functioned as a conduit for C.I.A . funds to support research of interest to that agency . I immediately went to my files to look at two of my publications , both of which appeared in the . Quarterly Journal of Alcohol Studies , whose editorial offices were then at Yale University . The footnotes to the titles read , respectively , as follows : " The research was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Human Ecology to the Butler Health Center , Providence , R.I. " and " This research was completed under a grant from the Human Ecology Fund . The author wishes to acknowledge the encouragement of Mr. James L. Monroe , executive director of the fund .... " To be sure , , there is no question in my mind that the work I and others accomplished in those days was research in which we were interested as individual scientists  --  i.e. , the effects of LSD and their therapeutic implications in the case of schizophrenic To the Editor : It is widely held that the issuance of ID cards is demeaning and in violation of civil rights . Why ? Among my possessions perhaps the one I treasure the most is my United States passport . What kind of American would be ashamed to be identified as an American ? My fingerprints are on record with the United States Army ; my picture and other personal data are on my passport . Not only is its possession a matter of pride , it 's a practical convenience . As is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laminated and with fingerprints and picture , might cost $500 million for 200 million-plus Americans , but that cost would be dwarfed by the inevitable cost of Social Security and Other benefits for illegal aliens . And it would go far  --  if perhaps not all the way  --  in solving the problem . Too , while the problem of the Immigration and Naturalization Service is clearly a difficult one , it could be largely solved by the radical use of courage and imagination . Anyone who has seen the means used by countries of Eastern Europe to keep people in To the Editor : Flora Lewis is to be commended for her excellent article ( July 31 ) on the " new philosophers " in France  --  e.g. , Bernard-Henri Levy  --  whose critique of Marxism and other " total " systems from the viewpoint of the democratic left comes at an especially propitious time before the 1978 French election . Levy and his intellectual fellows see the state based on Marxist principles , humane as they may sound , as leading to bureaucratic domination over human rights , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of that system . In this perception they follow the thought of Karl Popper , whose " The Open Society and Its Enemies " remains one of the seminal books of our generation . Because the U.S. divides government authority to such a. degree between Federal , state and local units , we sometimes forget that other countries  --  pre-eminently France  --  have no such system of regional checks and balances . The widely predicted Socialist/Communist victory in the coming To the Editor : I hasten to rebut Mr. Anderson 's Aug. 7 letter lest the reader be left with the wrong impression of solar heating costs and tax rebates pertaining thereto . The energy bill as passed by the House on Aug. 5 specifically provides that expenditures made between April 20 , 1977 , and Dec. 31 , 1984 , can qualify for the tax rebate . The house must have been built before April 20 . If the Senate goes along with this provision , any expenditure made after April 19 of this year will be eligible for a tax rebate , up to $2,150 for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system for residential heating and domestic hot-water requirements , this can be broken down as follows : In the zofle covering southern New York State , New Jersey and southern New England , a well-insulated three-bedroom house will require 200 to 300 square feet of absorber surface . This comes to 10 to 15 wee of the sizes now being offered commercially . Allowing for the customary mark-up by the installing contractor , the total equipment cost to the homeowner for the necessary panels , storage tank , heat exchangers , pumps and controls should not exceed $6,000 . Installation Robert Neubedier disorders and environmental ( " ecological " ! ) determinants of the effects of alcohol . Moreover , I can assure you that in the case of the Butler experiments with both drugs the dignity , the rights and the physical and psychological safety of the volunteer subjects were considered and protected as far as humanly possible . Finally , I can state that the research was accomplished in a professionally competent manner and the results were made publicly available . I am not , therefore , speaking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protection of subjects , of the uses to which research findings knows that it is quite possible to set up barriers  --  even along a 2,000-mile border  --  to keep them out . If that seems harsh , so be it . The people who come into this country illegally perform their very first act in arriving here by breaking our laws . Are we to make a mockery of our laws by rewarding them with all the benefits of citizenship ? Simply stated , this would be legalizing lawbreaking . During their heyday of recent times , European countries imported workers from other countries , issuing ID cards to them . They came in under contracts , and when their contracts expired they were scheduled for repatriation . There have been some difficulties with this program , but it is understood that there has also been a degree of success in some of the repatriation procedures on which this country could draw . We have enough citizens who show contempt . for the law by willfully breaking it . For our Government to put its stamp of approval on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , H. W.

The " new philosophers " have emerged in the nick of time to point to the dangers of this for the freedoms that many French people , and Americans , take for granted . FRANK A. SIEVERTS Washington , Aug. 1 , 1977 N-Bombs and Freedom To the Editor : About the neutron bomb , a letter writer asks ( Aug. 6 ) : " What is enhanced about it ? Compassion ? The right to live ? " Answer : Yes , the enhanced probability of our right to live as free Americans instead of Russian slaves as in half of Europe .

All of these are of concern . Rather , I would draw your attention to an equally if not more significant , yet to date strangely unclarified issue : I know that I ( and I am convinced that Dr. Robert W. Hyde , then superintendent of the Butler Health Center , as well as my other colleagues ) had no knowledge of the C.I.A . auspices and functions of the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology . In a word , this was a " black " operation ? deceptive and intended to deceive  --  on the part of my Government and addressed to me as a citizen . It is not enough for Senator Chafee to label the activities of the C.I.A . " abhorrent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those adversely affected by the experiments and to speak of " a moral obligation to these researchers and institutions to protect them from any unjustified embarrassment sic . " Parenthetically the least that might be done practically is clearly to differentiate between " political Intelligence " and " political operations . " For the two to be combined in a single agency is surely akin to asking the proverbial rat'to watch the cheese . But the bottom line remains : The domestication of psychological warfare , especially of " black " operations , in the name of national security is a cure that is surely worse than the disease . As The Times editorial makes clear , the issue is " Control C.I.A. , Not Behavior . " But this control is not a technical matter . Rather it is a matter of national policy and the character structures of those involved . Both must be firmly and explicitly anchored in our values as a free , democratic society based on a government of laws , however inexpedient and " risky . " HAROLD W. PFAUTZ Prof. of Sociology , Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limits of Control To the Editor : At the risk of belaboring an issue , I want to reply to your editorial , " Control C.I.A. , Not Behavior . " In it you urge strong Congressional response to the C.I.A.-sponsored medical experimentation of past decades . I and others will agree that the experiments often were abhorrent " studies ! ' whose victims now must be compensated and for which laws are needed to forfend recurrence . With you , we also should insist on holding senior and lower officials responsible . After proposing what Congress must do , however , you leave the impression that this will correct the earlier problems . I disagree : Though sometimes unconscionable , these experiments undoubtedly will continue , and for two reasons . Your own news stories broached the first of these while reporting on the Russian detention of Los Angeles Times reporter Toth . Behind his arrest was information alluding to Soviet research on occult phenomena ( to be used for intelligence and , perhaps , warfare ) . U.S. officials . who knew of this seemed concerned about an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could blame them ? As individuals trained to detect missile and arms " gaps , " they would worry about a new , potentially strategic ' gap . And attitudes like these today reflect the cold-war mentality that for two decades encouraged the C.I.A . experiments . Such experimentation will continue for another , double-edged reason : The intelligence community is a secret institution ( note both words ) , publicly funded but not publicly managed . We can not effectively regulate it or its studies . Thus , the two principals in a drama : the C.I.A . official for whom intelligence obtained by any " reasonable " means is intelligence , and the citizen who rightly demands that C.I.A . experiments be performed ethically and that trustworthy officials be appointed to oversee them . Without the secrecy shrouding intelligence work , this would be a drama of equals ; there is secrecy , and it is not . Residual cold-war attitudes , moreover , insure that some of the repugnant experimentation will recur . So , given the nature of intelligence work , there is only so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UDKA Highland Park , N.J. , Aug. 5 , 1977 How to Curb Illegal Immigration France : The New Philosophers ' Cause On the Cost of Solar Heating Installations
