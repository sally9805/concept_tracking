Joan Kennedy is a woman whose warmth and charm would have shone in almost any field of life . She has taught in public school and performed a Mozart piano concerto and read Peter and the Wolf with the Boston Symphony . Says one Bostonian who knows her well : " There is n't anyone wanner or dearer , when she 's feeling good . " But public life has not been kind to Joan Kennedy . Its wounds can be seen in the puffy eyes , the exaggerated makeup , the tales of alcoholism . Today she is a sadly vulnerable soul and an unknown factor in her husband 's electoral equation . <P> Her life did not begin that way . Joan Bennett was the debutante daughter of an advertising executive from Bronxville , N.Y . Educated at Catholic schools , she was 22 when she wed Edward Moore Kennedy . From her wedding day , " Joansie , " as Ted called her , found herself buffeted by the demands on a Kennedy wife . The hardest thing , she said shortly after her marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Only years later could she admit : " I tried to be like the Kennedys , bouncy and running all over . But I could never be that . " Even her repeated miscarriages seemed a special failure . " Subconsciously , " said Joan , " I 'd like to have been like Ethel and had one baby after another . " <P> Nor was she suited to the fierce brand of politics that formed the core of Kennedy life . Joan recalled herself arriving in Washington , at 26 the young wife of the youngest Senator , " totally ignorant of current events . " But to please Teddy , the self-professed homebody would valiantly hit the campaign trail . <P> The rigors of marriage to politics and Ted Kennedy proved too much for Joan , and she slipped into drink . She never needed much : she grew glassy-eyed after two drinks , often passed out after three . <P> Teddy 's attraction for women made things worse .

She attempted a succession of cures : reviving a music career that had faltered , then psychiatrists , alcoholism sanitariums , even megavitamin therapy . <P> For nearly two years Joan has been struggling alone to recover . Early in 1978 she moved to a spacious apartment in Boston 's Back Bay , devoid of political memorabilia but graced by a Steinway baby grand . It is , she told her children , " Mommy 's apartment , not Daddy 's . " She strained to make a life of her own ; studying for a master 's degree in education at Lesley College , fund raising for the arts , even dating a few " safe " men . <P> The privacy and anonymity of Boston have helped to steady Joan , but she has also been lonely , and she has suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 12 . But Daughter Kara , 19 , spent a happy summer with Joan , and both she and Brother Teddy Jr. , 18 , drive up often for weekends .
