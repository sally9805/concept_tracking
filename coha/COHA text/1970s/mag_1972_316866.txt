THE CHANGING ROOM <P> by DAVID STOREY <P> Life is war on the installment plan . With deceptive quietude , that is what David Storey , the most remarkable playwright to come out of England since Osborne and Pinter , has been telling us . The theme comes clear in The Changing Room , which is having its U.S. premire at New Haven 's Long Wharf Theater . <P> Playgoers and critics alike may be excused for having missed Storey 's central concern . In his earlier plays , his spare , meticulous and almost detached naturalism tempted us into thinking that Storey was dealing in slivers of life , when he was actually showing us life being shot away . Almost nothing happens in his plays . Ah , but on any given day , nothing much happens in life or war . In these enterprises , tedium is as certain as death is sure . <P> What are these segments of mortality as explored by Storey ? In Home , Storey told us of the war against old age , quavering forays into the land mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair in the sun at a home for the insane . In The Contractor , which also had its U.S. premire at the Long Wharf , Storey told of the daily war of work , the campaign that liquidates itself with the setting sun and must be fought again the very next day . Man and his toil-Sisyphus agonistes . Men put up a tent for a wedding party and then take it down . That is all that happens , and it is like watching an entire life unfold and then fold . <P> If The Changing Room is Storey 's most powerful and moving drama , it is because he has found in sport his purest metaphor for the war of existence . The characters are a semi-pro English north country rugby team . Six days of the week , they are peaceable , nondescript employees somewhere . On the seventh day , they gird up their loins for gory combat . The changing room is where they come and go from their catchpenny Armageddon . In Act I , the men perform their initiation rites , strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Act II , they come off the field of combat , boy-toy soldiers , some broken ( George Lithgow ) all muddy and bloody . In Act III , after a late-minute victory , they are roaring , towel-flipping conventioneers with a communal shower for champagne . <P> That is all there is , but it is enough to make this the finest new play seen on the North American continent this season , barring a miracle . The reason is not in the plot but in Storey 's ability to be as intimate with his characters ' hurts , hopes , desires and fighting instincts as an incomparable specialist doing open-heart surgery . The cast can not be praised singly or too highly . All are Americans , yet their English accents are so authentic that they seem to have been flown in by BOAC . Director Michael Rudman has elicited ensemble acting from this group that rates close to perfect . As for the Long Wharfs artistic director Arvin Brown , he knows viscerally what is good in drama , and season after season he presents it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg , borrow or skyjack him . <P> T.E .
