txt Letters to the Editor pg . 27 Letters to the Editor Ford on Eastern Europe .. To Own a Home To the Editor : I am the son of a Polish mother and a Montenegrin ( Yugoslav ) father . As head of one of America 's largest publishing houses , I publish Yugoslav , Polish , Hungarian , Rumanian and Czech writers . I publish Andrei Amalrik and other Russian dissidents . I support President Ford 's statement that the Yugoslav and Polish and Rumanian peoples " do not consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union , " These are brave peoples who have considerable resources in their history and in themselves : they do not consign themselves into Soviet slavery . Neither do the Hungarians or the Czechoslovaks concede , even though they are now under Soviet military control . Unless the United States is prepared to attack the Russians in these countries with troops and missiles  --  and I hope that Governor Carter is more sensible than to ask this ? then we have the real choice of encouraging nationalism in Eastern EuTo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , take the form of competitive press conferences do not lend themselves to elegance of expression or to accuracy of thought . But they do serve to reveal fundamental approaches and elemental understandings . President Ford 's comments concerning southern Africa , in the course of his second session with Governor Carter , are defective on both counts . " Mr. Kissinger , " said the President , " has done a superb job in getting the Prime Minister of South Africa , Mr. Vorster , to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia . " It does no disservice to the persuasive powers of Mr. Kissinger to point out that for at least two years Mr. Vorster and his Nationalist Party have been making clear their concern lest mounting unrest within South Africa , an isolated and bankrupt Rhodesia and overt hostility from all states surrounding South Africa make untenable the stubborn and vicious policy of a system of official racial discrimination within South Africa itself . Tax Reform Indeed ! ' To the Editor : One section of the new tax-reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term capital gain you must hold the asset for at least nine months next year and a full year beginning 197S . The advantage of such capital gain means you add only onehalf of such gain to your income for tax purposes . Recently I had occasion to sell some preferred stock of a utility company and made a good profit , after holding it for two years . This was purely unearned income to me , a retiree . All I did was call the broker to sell the stock . He got his commission , I have my profit and the Government will receive taxes on only half such capital gain . Contrast this with the average wage earner who has Federal and Social Security taxes withheld and possibly To the Editor : Nathan Glazer 's Sept. 29 Op-Ed article requires comment because of its erroneous assumptions and misleading conclusions . Herbert G. Gutman in his forthcoming book , " The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom , " has demolished the Moynihan thesis about the black family and much of what Glazer and Moynihan jointly wrote in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One can understand Glazer 's dismay at the superbly documented Gutman study , which casts serious doubt on Glazer 's and Moyniha.n 's credentials as social scientists . Glazer writes that the degree of stability of the black family has become " markedly adverse . " We must ask , adverse in comparison to what , when ? Had Glazer studied changing patterns of white family stability , he would have found that the number of female-headed families is currently increasing at a much faster rate among whites than among blacks . Between 1973 and 1975 , the number of femaleheaded white families increased 12 percent , double the 6 percent increase in female-headed black families during the same , two-year period . Similarly , the 20 percent increase in the number of white female family heads who were separated or divorced was twice as large as the percentage of black female family heads who were separated or rope by all means short of military invasion . The Soviet Union is not having an easy time in Eastern Europe ; it fears Polish popular dissent ; it dares not suppress Rumania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Yugoslav mountains . If bread strikes or work stoppages were to occur in Czechoslavakia or Hungary today  --  and we remember that revolt in Europe has more often begun by people saying " no " than by their firing on troops  --  then the Soviet Union runs the bad risk of murdering thousands upon thousands of people in the streets in the view of nearby Italy , Austria , Yugoslavia , Germany and France . President Ford has not committed a gaffe . He has said what Eastern Europeans feel : that they are not slaves ; that the future is not settled . WILLIAM JOYANOVICH Chmn. , Harcourt Brace Jovanovich , Inc . New York , Oct. 7 , 1976 An editorial on this subject appears today . If President Ford meant to say that the Government of South Africa , which up to the collapse of Portuguese rule in southern Africa had been the chief military and economic prop of the Smith regime of Rhodesia , is indeed the focus of contagion in southern Africa , then Mr. Ford was right But if he believes that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he mistakes the cynical , time-buying strategy of a hard-line Afrikaner for the wisdom and statesmanship of a Marshal Jan Christian Smuts . South Africa remains the key to the future of southern Africa 's racial confrontation , and the destiny of Rhodesia and Namibia are interlocked with that of the beleaguered republic , whose principal trading partners are the United States and Great Britain . If the United States should persuade Mr. Vorster of the need to bring South Africa itself into the 20th century , we would have done a " superb job " indeed . ERNEST A. GROSS The writer is a former Assistant Secretary of State . state and/or city taxes to boot if he is so unfortunate as to live in such taxing jurisdiction . The original reason for a tax break was to encourage risk capital to invest in American industry . Most of our " investors " are mere stock gamblers . Tax reform indeed ! Plug the loophole . SAMUEL SKLAREW Lighthouse Pt. , Fla. , Oct. 5 , 1976 , ? Menckenism To the Editor : William V. Shannon 's last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barnum 's wise saying , " No man ever went broke underestimating the taste of the public . " Sage it was , but it came from H. L. Mencken , not P. T. Barnum , and the quotation is : " No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public . " HAROLD D. MOSES South Hamilton , Mass. , Oct. 6 , 1976 To the Editor : In Carla Hills ' letter of Sept. she states that housing starts has at - risen dramatically . While there may be some areas nationally that are doing well , the most optimistic guess is 1.5 million starts , down from two million in 1971 , and about one million starts below estimates to keep up with increased family formations and deterioration in national housing supply . In the Philadelphia-South Jersey metropolitan area , the unemployment in housing jobs is approximately 30 percent , and housing starts are 60 percent below three years ago . The savings and loans and other lending institutions have plenty of money for mortgage financing , but interest rates remain frozen at 9 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in the PhiladelphiaStuart Levis South Jersey area , and I am amazed at the courage of families earning approximately $15,000 a year who undertake a home purchase , provided they can qualify for a mortgage , despite the fact that the carrying charges together with utilities and taxes will add up to close to 30 per : cent of the family income . In many cases potential home purchasers do not qualify for a mortgage , and they wonder why they are shut out of the most basic desires of the American family . Subsidies may not be necessary , but obviously President Ford and Mrs. Hills have not even begun to face up to the national housing crisis . HARRY KATZ Turnersville , N.J. , Sept. 30 , 1976 ? To the Editor : In Carla Hills ' letter of Sept. 29 she clarified the " President 's plan " reducing down payments on F.H.A. mortgages . Ms , Hills also stated that , in avoiding a subsidy , " the taxpayer is saved another layer of bureaucracy . " As a nonprofit corporation which counsels and assists thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find Ms. Hills ' statement that " the supply of mortgage credit has increased " to be deceiving , Yes , the money supply is up , but not the number of banks willing to plow through the bureaucratic process of F.H.A. forms and processes . If the President and Ms. Hills want to improve the effectiveness of F.H.A. financing they can ( 1 ) simplify their cumbersome forms , ( 2 ) improve the procedural steps between bank , F.H.A. and H.U.D. and ( 3 ) allow nonprofit groups like ours to give low-interest second mortgages when the down payment is insufficient to cover F.H.A. requirements plus substantial closing costs . A case in point : F.H.A. gave 71/4 percent mortgages on new construction on condominiums in Stamford . But there was a $12,000 to $15,000 differential between the mortgage they gave and the sales price of the units . Could the moderate-income family or the recently promoted black executive have a chance to save up that much ? No way ! They must go for a 90 percent M.G.I.C. at 91/4 percent . So whom does F.H.A. try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to clean house , reduce their own bureaucracy and reach the millions of Americans in real need of their help , PAULA REENS Fairfield County Director Conn . Housing Investment Fund Wilton , Conn. , Sept , 30 , 1976 . . . And on Southern Africa Of Blacks , Whites and Family Stability divorced between 1973 and 1975 . Most significantly , while the number of white children in one-parent families increased by 16 percent over the last two years , the number of black children in one-parent families went up by only 7 percent . This development is all the more significant in the light of recent data which show that the percentage of white males living in poverty held steady at 15.1 percent from the first quarter of 1975 to the first quarter of this year , while the figure for black males rose by 1.3 percent  --  or 50,000 individuals  --  to 45.9 percent . Furthermore , the number of white women employed but living below the poverty level dropped by 5,000 over the past year , but the number of black women in that category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is structured into the economy , and that without affirmativeaction programs black workers will have to wait until the millennium before achieving equality with whites . Implicit in Glazer 's argument is the assumption that no matter how much " we " do for " them , " nothing really changes . Thus , once again , the black victim is made responsible for his condition , thereby exonerating racist practices and institutions . HERBERT HILL . National Labor Director N.A.A.C.P. New York , Oct. 7 , 1976 ? Murrow , Paley and CBS To the Editor : In his Sept. 16 column , " What Is the Press , " Mr. Satire stated that CBS Chairman William S. Paley " resolutely forced Ed Murrow out of broadcasting . " It was a minor point in Mr. Safire 's story , but one about which I happen to know something . The statement is untrue , and to my mind just nonsense . Although Ed and Bill often differed , there was between them a strong bond of affection and respect to the very end . Ed left CBS to head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was his pleasure and privilege to serve his country . He always knew that he was welcome to return to CBS when his Government service ended . JANET ( MRS . EDWARD R. ) MURROW London , Sept. 30 , 1976 ? Toward the Better Life To the Editor : Congratulations to you and Edgar Bronfman for his " Fat Cat " piece on the Op-Ed page Sept. 19 . As a nonfat-cat , may I suggest however that his points apply not only to business but to many other groups of citizens ? universities , the professions , artists , labor unions , etc . They can all " start to re-examine " their own behavior , and so can we as individuals . We have dozens of domestic problems that can he solved by local citizens , If they have the will to do so . Thus we all have a unique chance for that better life which has been and should be our American dream . LEONA BAUMGARTNER , M.D. Cambridge , Mass , , Sept. 24 , 1976         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
