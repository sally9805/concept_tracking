TO the candidates , the primaries must I loom like some monstrous political version of the Great Wall of China : an awesome structure , stretching on and on , that has never decided a battle . As they campaigned in Wisconsin , the Democratic candidates were already showing serious signs of wear and tear . Yet this was only the fourth primary ; there are a staggering 19 still to go . <P> The system was not designed to exhaust the candidates or bankrupt the party or elect Richard Nixon . But it seems to be doing all three . Around the White House , the least euphoric Republican says he is merely " confident " that Nixon will win . The others are gloating over the opposition 's predicament . While the Democrats have always engaged in intraparty bloodletting , the wounds they are inflicting this year are going to take longer to heal . <P> Firing Squad . Why have they done this to themselves ? One explanation has been offered in another context : when reform-minded Democrats are told to make up a firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up with the best of intentions . After the disastrous 1968 Chicago convention , which took place in the streets as much as in the amphitheater , the Democrats decided that more people should be drawn into the nominating process . State party organizations were given a choice : either take the caucuses that select convention ' delegates out of the smoke-filled back rooms and open them to the rank and file party members , or hold a primary . <P> Many states opted for the primary , since it seemed the easier course . Their choice may also have been guided by the fact that a primary brings a state a lot of attention , an influx of tourists and considerable business . Some $6,000,000 , for instance , was poured into Wisconsin by the primary contenders . <P> But this year 's primaries have not worked out the way they were supposed to . So many candidates have jumped into them that no one has much chance of emerging a clear winner . Even if one candidate in a primary does manage to lead the pack , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals . The pile-up of names on the ballot gave an unforeseen boost to George Wallace , who won in Florida because the vote was split so many ways . Wallace might be contained if some of the liberal or centrist candidates quit the race . But on the eve of Wisconsin , only Vance Hartke , after getting 3% of the vote in New Hampshire and .3% in Florida , has had the grace to get out of a contest he never had a chance of winning . <P> Despite the cost to a candidate of mounting a primary campaign , compensations in publicity are high . The press lavishes attention on the primaries because they have the ingredients of a suspense story . The press , in fact , has become the unofficial arbiter of the results , deciding who wins and who loses in races where the real meaning of the outcome is bound to be murky . Savoring this new-found power , NBC News Vice President Richard Wald has half humorously suggested that the primaries be held at the convenience of the press : Southern primaries should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thaw begins should reporters have to make the blustery trek north to New Hampshire and Wisconsin .
