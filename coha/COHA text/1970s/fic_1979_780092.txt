" The taller man opened his eyes , blinked , shaded them with a hand . " Not as difficult as you might think , " he said , turning over . " Let me get the sand off you , " his friend volunteered . He brushed his hand across the taller man 's shoulders and methodically worked his way down , finishing at the ankles . " There , " he said . Then he turned over with a grunt .

" I could eat  --  what do you say ? ? a horse , " the shorter man said . " That 's what we say , all right . " The taller man broke into a trot . " Race you to the boat , " he called over his shoulder , splashing the water with his feet , then diving expertly into the surf . " It 's a race ! " his companion shouted . They swam in single file , the shorter man second . Almost without effort , he closed the gap between them and pulled ahead .

" We 'll discuss your forfeit over dinner . " He made as if to steady the boat , but instead took a deep breath , lunged for his companion and grabbed him in a bear hug , pinning his arms to his sides . Before the taller man 's face could even register surprise , both disappeared beneath the surface . Except for the immediate vicinity , the sea was calm . The boat rocked violently in the sudden foam for more than a minute , then steadied . The two men resurfaced nearby , still locked in their deadly embrace . The shorter man gulped air and swam toward the boat , towing the other with a chin hold . He lifted the body into the boat , got in himself , and rowed back to the island .

" Channing leaned toward the driver and said , " Fairmont . " As the cab glided away , Day took a deep breath and looked around . He liked Chinatown , especially in the evening . The shop displays , the lights and lanterns , the pungent fragrances that assaulted the nostrils whenever a door opened , even the jostling of the crowd served to remind him that life went on . It had grown chilly ; he stepped into the entranceway of a novelty store . A display of carved ivory boxes caught his eye and he wondered whether he should buy a present for Susan . Deciding he would do it later , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street and reversed direction . He did not notice the young black man in a rumpled army field jacket carrying a folded newspaper who crossed with him . The black man walked behind him , stopping in front of stores as frequently as Day . They walked like that for several blocks ; then Day turned up a side street . The black man picked up his pace and looked around casually before he too turned the corner . The crowd sounds grew muted behind them as they covered block after block . Soon they were alone . The young black passed Day and disappeared into the darkness ahead . Day stopped less frequently now , for the stores were farther apart , separated by apartment houses . He had just promised himself that he would turn back at the next traffic light when a voice spoke out of the darkness . " Freeze , motherfucker . " He winced at the word and continued to walk . " I mean you , motherfucker . Freeze ! " Day stopped and peered into an alley . The black man pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Guess , you ofay bastard . " The black man 's newspaper fell to the ground , revealing a knife . He pushed the doctor against a brick wall . " Close your eyes , " he ordered , waving the weapon . Day obeyed and felt his watch being slipped off his wrist . The black man was breathing hard . " Keep your eyes closed and count to twenty . " His hand patted Day 's breast and found his wallet . Day began counting . Before he reached seven , the blade of the 8  | knife ripped through his chest , piercing the right ventricle of his heart . He slumped to the ground with a sigh . The black man retrieved the knife , wiped it clean on Day 's jacket and rewrapped it in the newspaper . He extracted the bills , then dropped the wallet on the doctor 's chest . " Nothin ' personal , man , " he said , disappearing into the night . At 6:10 A.M. , Eastern Standard Time , Susan Allgood picked up the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat bolt upright as a San Francisco detective , trying hard to soften the blow , informed her of her father 's death . Four hours later , with her husband , she boarded a TWA 707 flight from Baltimore to San Francisco , where she identified her father and signed some papers . The Allgoods accompanied the body to Salt Lake City , where they hired a hearse for the last leg of Dr. Lucius Day 's final journey home , to Dalton , Utah . August 13 , 1974 . Charles Pendleton could feel the pumping action of his heart . He had held the dice for twenty-five minutes ; over $1500 in chips lay in the rack before him , with another $200 on the pass line and $400 more on various place and proposition bets . As long as he threw anything but craps , he would win something . He rattled the dice and tossed them in a high parabola over the table . They ricocheted off the back and came up eleven . The crowd around the table roared approval . Word had passed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serious gamblers had quickly positioned themselves about it . Behind them a second group , not participating itself but thrilled to witness a winner in action , had formed to root against the house . " You are not only a gen'leman and a scholah , suh , " a bettor in western garb announced while the dealers paid off the winners , " you are one hell of a crap shootah . Do it again ! " The speaker stacked six $25 chips on the pass line . Pendleton maintained his outward calm , although his head throbbed . He bet another $200 and threw the dice in his customary way . " Eight . The point is eight , " the stickman announced . While the players were getting down their bets , the dealer at 9  | Pendleton 's end of the table looked at him for instructions . He tossed three $100 chips across the table . " Press all the numbers , " he said . The dealer nodded and gave him $40 in change . Pendleton threw a four and collected $180 ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the general jubilation , an eight . The man in the western outfit winked at him . He held the dice for ten more minutes before sevening out and left the table with $3,750 in chips in his pockets . His last toss had cost him almost $1,100 . Still , it had been a good roll . The crowd 's applause still ringing in his ears , he crossed the casino to the cashier 's cage , narrowly avoiding collision with a Keno girl dressed like a Roman slave . A young man counted out thirtyseven crisp hundred-dollar bills , then added two twenties and a ten . " Right , " Pendleton said , pocketing the money . He went to the bar and ordered a straight bourbon . He enjoyed everything about Las Vegas and made it a point to get there at least twice a year . No one in his home town would have suspected that Charlie Pendleton loved to gamble ; it was probably better that way . He was in the dairy business , which he did not particularly like , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented a far easier life than any he might have fashioned for himself . Last year he had earned sixty thousand dollars ; this year promised to be even better . The truth was , Archie Donahue , who had worked under Pendleton 's father , really ran the business . Pendleton was a bachelor by choice . At forty-one , he had had numerous opportunities to marry any one of the prettier girls in Box Elder County . But a three-year stint in a combat engineer battalion in Korea , where he earned a reputation as a hell raiser , had left him reluctant to settle down . It was in the army that he had learned to gamble ; winning nineteen hundred dollars in a nonstop poker game on the troopship that brought him home had confirmed his belief that good fortune was part of his birthright . It was in the army , too , that he had learned to drink and patronize whorehouses , a style of living he saw no reason to abandon as a civilian .  | He had just swiveled in his chair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arm around his shoulder ; it was the man in the western clothes . " Ah wan na thank you , suh , " he said . " You broke a nasty losin ' streak back theah and Ah would like to show mah appreciation in some concrete way . Can Ah buy you another drink ? " Pendleton declined . " Here alone ? " " Yep . " " No need , you know . Ah have a friend , Arlene , who would be purely delighted to get you a date . And , " he added in a stage whisper , " Ah mean built ! " Ordinarily , Pendleton would have accepted , but he disliked people who pursued him . " Thanks , anyway , " he said , " but I have other plans . " " Puhfec'ly all right . Jus ' wanted to express my gratitude . Change your mind , do n't hesitate to contac ' me . Room elevenoh-seven . Ai n't that a helluva numbah for a crap shootah ? Jake Goldsboro 's the name . Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ah did n't catch yours . " " Harry Richardson , " Pendleton replied , using the name he always assumed with casual acquaintances in Las Vegas . Later , after a light dinner in the coffee shop , he regretted turning down Goldsboro . Maybe he 'd call him later . He lost twenty dollars at the slot machines , switched to roulette , then decided to try some of the other casinos . He returned to the hotel shortly after midnight , down four hundred dollars , and headed for the casino bar . It was too early to go to sleep ; besides , his juices were flowing now . The dinner show had broken and the tobacco smoke that coiled across the casino was slowly thickening as the emerging couples swarmed to the tables . The swollen crowd injected a new excitement into the gaming area that carried over to the bar . In his anxiety to get to a crap table , he left his stool abruptly , colliding with someone holding a drink . It was a girl , a tall redhead with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver lame that reached the floor . She was in her late twenties , wearing just a little too much makeup , but in the perennial dusk that enveloped the casino , her face looked almost delicate . She hobbled backward in an effort to avoid spilling the drink on her gown . " Oh , gee . Say , I 'm terribly sorry . Did you get any on you ? " He was genuinely concerned . She surveyed her front . " I do n't think so . " " Let me buy you a fresh drink . " She nodded and slid onto a stool next to his . The bartender , who had witnessed the accident , set a daiquiri down in front of the girl . Pendleton looked at her profile . She was a knockout , all right , with breasts like balloons . " My name 's Harry , " he said . " Dolores . " " See the show ? " " Yesterday . I 'm crazy about Steve and Eydie . " " I hear they 're very good . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Vegas ? " She turned her face to him and pursed her lips to hold back a smile . She looked at him a long time , then shook her head , slowly . He understood . " How much ? " he asked . " A hundred  --  up front . " He nodded once and told her his room number . " Let 's finish our drinks , " he suggested . " If you do n't mind , I 'd rather not , " she said . " Some champagne later would be nice , though . " " Okay . Come up in five minutes . " He paid for their drinks and took the elevator to the sixteenth floor . In his room he sat on the edge of a massive king-size bed covered with a crimson imitation-velvet spread and ordered a bottle of champagne from room service , then headed for the bathroom , where he slapped some cologne on his face . The knock on the door was just right  --  not too loud , not too soft . Confident . He let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She really was a  | sensational-looking girl , with near-perfect features and a creamy complexion . She went to a night table and snapped on the radio built into it . With a dazzling smile , she turned to him . " Can I have my present now ? " Reaching into his pocket , he peeled a hundred dollars from a thick roll of bills and handed it to her . She tucked it into her purse . " I like to get that part out of the way , " she explained . " I understand . " A pause . Then , " Is there anything special I can do for you ? " " Let 's wait till the champagne gets here . " " Oh , sure . " She walked around the room . " Early New Orleans whorehouse  --  that 's what a friend of mine calls the decor . " She studied a framed print on the wall . " And your basic Utrillo . " Pendleton thought she sounded better educated than most ; certainly she spoke well . He wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He really did n't care . There was a knock on the door . The girl let in a young Hispanic-looking waiter carrying a bottle of Piper-Heidsick and two champagne glasses on a tray . After setting the tray down , he proffered the bill for Pendleton 's signature . But Pendleton paid cash , preferring not to risk the girl 's seeing his real name . " Shall I pour ? " the waiter asked . Pendleton shook his head . The waiter withdrew . Pendleton sank back on the couch . " Now , " he said with a smile , steepling his fingers and giving the girl his undivided attention , " get naked for me . " Dolores made a striptease of it , dancing to the radio music . Her clothes were allowed to remain on the floor where they fell as she walked back and forth before him , unzipping , unhooking , peeling , smiling . When she was totally nude , she stood on tiptoe , raised her arms over her head and turned around slowly , like a ballerina . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , " he said , getting to his feet , " it 's time we got acquainted . " Afterward , in bed , the girl suggested , " How about that champagne now ? " He made as if to rise , but she gently pushed him down . 13  | " Let me . Part of the service . " She crossed the room , opened her purse , from which she extracted a package of cigarettes , and reached for the champagne . Since her back was to Pendleton , he could not see the small pellet she dropped into his glass . She poured the champagne and rejoined him in bed . He sat up and took a sip . " You 're very good , " he said . " I know . " " I really mean it . You 're very good . " " So are you , lover . " He took another sip . Ever do encores ? " " They cost . " " That 's okay . " " Let 's finish our drink first , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the covers and touched him . " Ready ? " she whispered . He tried to answer , but could not summon his voice . The room had grown uncomfortably warm ; he felt dizzy and nauseous . There was a sensation of falling . Darkness . For a moment , Dolores did not move . Then she reached for the phone and dialed a four-digit number . " Okay , " she said , and hung up . She dressed , ran a comb through her hair , rinsed and wiped the champagne glasses clean . She wondered if she dared take his cash , but thought better of it . These people did n't kid around , she knew , and she was under specific instructions not to touch any money . There was a rap on the door . She opened it for a stocky man in a dark gray suit . Jerking her head toward the bed , she said , " Over there , " and left . The stocky man sat on the edge of the bed , thumbed open one of Pendleton 's eyelids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what he saw , he extracted a slim vinyl case from inside his jacket , unzipped it and held a hypodermic syringe up to the light . He opened Pendleton 's mouth , inserted the syringe under the tongue , pressed the plunger . Pendleton did not move . The man paused at the door , sweeping his eyes over the room . Then he was gone . Because the maids in Las Vegas are accustomed to the erratic hours kept by guests , Pendleton 's body was not discovered until  | 6:13 P.M. When death occurs naturally , as Charles Pendleton 's apparently did , the hotel acts quickly and discreetly . The body was spirited to the service elevator and taken to the city morgue , where the examining physician attributed death to a massive heart attack , confiding later to friends that , in view of the semen stains on the bed sheets , it was his considered opinion that the poor bastard had at least died happy . It fell to a state trooper named Al Horowitz , who was a neighbor , to break the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case the decedent 's mother . He did his utmost to comfort the bereaved woman , but she proved inconsolable . On August 18 , 1974 , Charles Pendleton was buried in the family plot , not far from the chapel of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Dalton , Utah , near his father , Eugene . Mrs. Pendleton , near collapse , was placed in a nursing home , where she remained for nearly eight weeks , grieving for her son . From the front page of the September 2 , 1975 , edition of the Lakeview ( Me . ) Leader : FIRE RAZES MOTEL Perry 's Place , a 14-unit motel at the junction of Routes 11 and 212 , just south of Lakeview , burned to the ground early this morning . According to Fire Chief Lester Pembroke , the fire , of unknown origin , broke out at approximately 4:00 A.M. , most likely in the room of Harold Westpfahl , 54 , and his wife , Ethel , 51 , who were the only two fatalities . The Westpfahls , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Utah , where Mr. Westpfahl practiced pharmacy . They had been visiting Mrs. Westpfahl 's sister and brother-in-law , Mr. and Mrs. David Fontaine , of Aroostook City . Nine other occupants of the motel , including proprietor Perry Davenport , were taken to Lakeview Memorial Hospital for treatment of smoke inhalation and shock . All have been discharged .  | On the fourteenth floor of an altogether unremarkable office building on K Street , Northwest , not far from Vermont Avenue , in Washington , D.C. , there is a door marked " Global Venture Capital , Inc . " Privately owned , the company was incorporated in 1954 with a capitalization of $7.5 million . Fewer than sixty people are employed full time by the firm , and most of them are scattered around the world . GVC 's announced objectives are simple : find promising business ventures , wherever they may be ; provide the necessary technical aid and capital for expansion or development of a new idea , process or product ; and in return receive minority equity in the enterprise . Its unannounced objectives are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GVC is not required to disclose very much about its activities or finances , but for more than a quarter of a century it has operated successfully in many countries , both developed and developing : Japan , South Korea , Thailand , Chile , Iran , Egypt , the United Kingdom and Nigeria , among others . Its success may be attributed to three things : painstaking research by its agents ; easy access to a corps of technical experts of every description ; and , based on the assumption that opportunity never sleeps , its policy of keeping its communications center manned twenty-four hours a day , seven days a week . On a crisp Monday morning in late March , GVC president and chief executive officer Clarence Harcourt was seated at his desk , reviewing a stack of cables that had accumulated during the night , when his secretary opened the door . " Number two line , sir , " she said . Harcourt waited until she left before unlocking a two-drawer filing cabinet which housed a telephone . As soon as he lifted the receiver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Jefferson Memorial is particularly beautiful at this time of year . " " Yes . " 19  | " In half an hour ? " " Certainly . " Harcourt arrived by cab . Without looking , he knew the Director would already be there . Arriving first for appointments was just one of the many ploys he used to establish a subtle , but effective , psychological advantage over other people . There was no mistaking his figure , even from a distance : the dark greatcoat ; the everpresent rolled umbrella , an affectation whose origins went back to his tour of duty in England , where he had served on General Eisenhower 's staff during the war ; the ramrod posture . As the distance between them diminished , the Director 's granite features , topped by a brow worthy of an ancient prophet , came into focus . Jeremiah must have looked like that , Harcourt thought . The Director was standing motionless at the base of the nineteen-foot statue . " Good morning , " Harcourt began . The Director did not acknowledge his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to top , then spoke as if thinking aloud . " When will we see his like again ? " " A great man . " " Perhaps our greatest . The breadth of vision , the faith in man 's capacity for shaping his own destiny . " Harcourt removed his glasses and polished them with a handkerchief . With their removal , his eyes appeared to recede into his head . A tall , spare man , he was in the final stages of baldness , with a pinched face and a thin mouth framed forever in creases like parentheses . He polished his glasses longer than necessary . When the Director chose to wax philosophical , he could not be rushed . Best to wait him out . " Men of vision , men of purpose are few and far between , " the Director continued in the bass voice that had briefed Presidents . " They come ... what ? Once in a generation ? Once in a hundred years ? Who knows ? Meanwhile , the plodders  --  you and I , Harcourt  --  must preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose is vouchsafed us . " We must be ready to defend and , if necessary , to die for their visions . You understand ? " " I do , indeed . " 20  | " There are evil men who envy this nation 's energy , wealth and power . They would annihilate what eight generations have labored to achieve . They are the destroyers ; we , the preservers . We are destined to do battle forever . " He read from the main entablature , high above them : " I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man ; " then added , " ... and his body . " The Director began to walk slowly around the rotunda ; Harcourt found himself falling into step . After a prolonged silence , held as if to mark a shift in the gears of his thinking , the Director said , " It is our understanding that leshlenkov is ready to disaffiliate . " " So soon ? " " It may signify that his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permit him even the opportunity to express the desire . On the other hand , it may mean that he has leaped the final hurdle in his mind only and wishes to come over before the equation , so to speak , is completed . Or he may simply be riddled with guilt . " In any event , an opportunity presents itself during the week of April fourth , when there will be a five-day scientific convention at the Hotel Wien in Vienna . Beshlenkov will be permitted to attend , primarily to demonstrate , I suspect , that nothing out of the ordinary is happening to keep him at home . A complete dossier will be delivered to you later this morning . " I leave it to GVC to arrange the details , but I can not stress too strongly the vital importance of getting Beshlenkov to these shores . And Vienna will be your only opportunity .

We have reliable reports that their man is preparing to demand before the General Assembly that we join them in a drastic reduction in arms expenditures .

If they do indeed have Zeta , they will need precious few arms to bring us to our knees . 21  | We will join the Carthaginians and the Etruscans on the dust heap of history . " I hope I have made clear what is at stake . I do not care how you do it ; I do not care what resources , material or human , you squander in order to do it ; but do it , Harcourt .

" " I have a man in mind , " Harcourt said . 22  | Suede-jacketed against the wind , Laura Meredith ran up the steps her apartment building in her customary manner , stopping idway to wave goodbye to the rest of the car pool , continuing to the top , then rummaging in a cavernous purse for the key . For me reason , Max the doorman was seldom visible when she arved home at 5:30 from her job as a researcher in the Bureau of International Commerce . She had chosen to live in Silver Spring , Maryland , when she got her job because one , it was convenient , less than seven miles from work , and two , it was the best she and her roommate , Sally Piedont , could afford . By the time the door snapped shut behind her , she had checked her mailbox and was clicking her way across the lobby . The polished floor reflected good legs , with trim ankles and softly curved calves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miliar couple . When the elevator door opened , an old man wearing a too-tight jacket and a too-small hat sat slouched on a stool in front of the control panel . " Where 's Eddie ? " the other woman asked . " Sick . I 'm filling in , " he answered in the flutelike voice old men often have . " Floors , please . " " Eight , " the woman said . " Ten , " Laura Meredith called , sorting through her mail and frowning at an unexpected bill . The elevator took off with a jerk , causing the couple to exchange meaningful glances . " I 'm a little out of practice , " the old man explained . " Been retired . " When the couple got out , he asked , " What floor was that again , Miss ? " " Ten . " The elevator jerked upward once more , but came to a smooth stop . " Watch your step , " the old man cautioned . 23  | Laura Meredith stepped forward , anticipating the door 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She whirled about to face the old man , at the same time shifting her grip on her purse so that it could be used as a weapon if necessary . " Did you pinch me ? " she demanded . " Sure did , honey . " He winked and made a clucking sound . " I 've seen a lot of cute bottoms in my time , but yours is , without a doubt ? " " I 'm going to rep ? " She halted in mid-sentence , eyes narrowing as she took a step closer to him . Then she lifted his cap and yanked off a gray wig . " Jim ? Jim , you crazy fool ! What are you doing here ? " Her eyes glowed with pleasure and then they were in each other 's arms , kissing , not letting go even when the buzzing started and the floor buttons lit up in the elevator , holding , holding , growing breathless together . Slowly , she released herself . " What did you do to Eddie ? " " Made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Four different floors were buzzing for attention . Arms around each other 's waists , they walked down the corridor to her apartment , where Eddie was standing next to a suitcase . He looked relieved to see them . " Everything go okay , Mr. Knight ? " " As you can see . Meanwhile , your public is calling . Better take care of them . " James Knight traded jackets with Eddie , carefully positioned the cap on the elevator man 's head and patted him on the back , gently propelling him toward the elevator . Inside the apartment they lingered over another kiss . Then James Knight excused himself . " Let me get this gook off . I do n't want to scare Sally . " " Why did n't you let me know you were coming ? " Laura called through the bathroom door . " Did n't know it myself till a few hours ago , " he shouted back . The sound of running water . " I could have made arrangements ! " " Ca n't hear you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still make them . " " I hate to spring it on Sally without any notice ! "  | " You 'd do the same for her . " " And have ! " " We 'll work it out . " " You should have let me know ! " " Told you , did n't know myself . " " Still  --  " " Why are you yelling ? " he asked , appearing as himself at the door with a towel in his hand and pecking her lightly on the nose . " I owe you a quarter jar of cold cream . " He wiped a smudge of makeup from her face . She made Bloody Marys for them , kicked off her shoes and curled up on the couch beside him , her eyes never leaving his face as he told her about his work as an investment counselor for Global Venture Capital , Inc . It was a face that , in another age , would have been termed manly . James Knight had dark mocking eyes that melted women and commanded the attention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defied all combs and brushes ; and a complexion going on olive . At thirty-four he was one of Global Venture Capital 's thirteen prime agents , none of whom had ever met  --  or seen a photograph of  --  the others . Currently based in Munich , his major area of responsibility was the southern tier of Europe and the Middle East . " ... so now , " he was finishing , " GVC is in the diet soda business in Libya . " " Sounds wonderful , " Laura said , although that was precisely what she would have replied if James Knight had informed her that he had roasted and eaten a fellow passenger over the Atlantic . He lay on the couch , his head on her lap , one ankle across a knee and asked , " And how is the Department of Commerce treating you ? " " Like an employee . " She played with his hair . " How 's Fergy ? " " Fine . He sends his love . " A key turned in the latch . Then a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the living room under the burden of a large bag of groceries . " Jim , what are you doing here ? " " Everybody keeps asking me that . Ca n't a fella visit his girl ? flow are you , Sally ? " He rose and kissed her on the cheek , relieving her of the bag , which he carried into the kitchen . " Be careful with that , " she said . " You 're handling thirty bucks 25  | worth of vitamins and health foods . " She turned to Laura and whispered , " I 'll clear out in a jiffy . " " I 'm sorry . I had absolutely no warning . " " No problem . I 'll bunk with Doris down the street . She owes me a favor . " " You 're a darling . " Knight entered the room , tossing a jar in the air . " What 's soya lecithin good for ? " " Heart , arteries , skin tone , complexion , " Sally recited . " There 's a better way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jar to her . " Until they bottle it , some of us will have to settle for lecithin , " Sally tossed over her shoulder on the way to her bedroom . There were sounds of a telephone being dialed , a brief muffled conversation and a closet door opening . She reappeared a few minutes later , carrying an overnight case . " I just remembered , my aunt is sick . " " My compliments to the lady . Nothing serious , I hope , " Knight said . " How long will you be in town ? " " Only a day or two , looks like . " A pained look flitted across Laura 's face . " Then I do n't think Aunt Doris is seriously ill . " " Thank you , love , " he said . Sally asked Laura to please put the vitamins away , and left . After supper in a nearby Italian restaurant and a short walk , they returned to the apartment . Knight took a few items out of his suitcase ; they showered together , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking of inconsequential things . " Only one night , " she said . " More than likely . And a stolen one at that . The old man cabled me to report to him immediately , but I got lucky and caught an early flight . I wanted to see you . " " Did you ? " " Very much . " " I could phone in sick tomorrow . " " Better not . I have to be at the office at nine-thirty . What time do you get up ? " " Six-thirty . "  | " Wake me . " " Three hours to get to K Street ? " " Lots of things to attend to . " He cradled her face in his hands . " Some of them important . " He pulled her close and undid her robe . Her body was firm , yet softly inviting , and there was eagerness in her response to his kisses , and hunger for lost time . " Let 's go to bed , " she whispered in his ear , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and dropped his robe to the floor . They kissed again , straining to see each other in the dark . Only their flesh spoke now , asking urgent questions , seeking age-old answers in the Maryland night .. . ... the ride was gut-rattling . They had left Bengazi four hours earlier , heading southeast by ancient pickup toward Al-Jaghbub , and had not yet covered even eighty of the two hundred rut-ridden miles of secondary road . The sun was almost directly overhead and , deprived of the moderating breezes off the Mediterranean , the air  --  oven hot , blanket heavy , palpable  --  hovered over sand that curved off in all directions toward the horizon . Knight could n't decide whether it was hotter with the window open or shut . For psychological reasons , he kept his open ; it at least offered the illusion of circulating air . Occasionally , he could hear the road crumble under the well-worn tires of the truck which , for the last half hour , had been operating under protest in second gear in order to negotiate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck 's general debilitation a radiator with a diabetic thirst necessitating frequent stops , and the estimate of its reticent driver , Mukhtar , that they would arrive at their destination before nightfall sounded optimistic in the extreme . That destination was a building site roughly one hundred miles northwest of Al-Jaghbub , in the middle of the desert , about which Washington had received disturbing reports . An airstrip already existed and the main building and adjoining living quarters were scheduled for completion within the month . As soon as the buildings were up , the report had it , the nuclear reactor would be delivered and the technicians moved in . This timetable did not at all suit Washington , which believed  | that any nuclear technology introduced into the Middle East should be by courtesy of the United States , with strict controls and periodic inspections by qualified teams as part of the deal . Such an arrangement presupposed a certain sense of responsibility and mutual trust between the contracting parties . By no stretch of the imagination did Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi qualify on either count . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Sadat of Egypt more nervous than he already was , a condition that , combined with a tense Israel , represented too volatile a mix to tolerate at this time . On the other hand , the People 's Republic of China , anxious to gain a foothold in the Middle East , felt it was her prerogative to gift any Third World country she chose with nuclear know-how . As a sworn and proven enemy of the West , Qaddafi appeared to be the most deserving recipient of such largesse . Because surface relations between the United States and the PRC had been improving so dramatically , the American government decided not to jeopardize them with anything so crass as a formal protest over the Libyan adventure . Instead , a straightforward action plan consisting of two parts was drawn up : one , destroy the installation ; and two , deny all knowledge of either the installation or its destruction , should denials become necessary . Thus do governments communicate with each other . As the truck bumped down the other side of the mountain , Knight thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying dynamite or nitroglycerin , the first of which would have been detonated long ago by the heat and the second , by the jouncing of the truck . Plastic explosives might have eliminated some of the romance from his profession , but they added significantly to agent longevity . The plastic for the job at hand was resting in rope-like coils behind the drums of olive oil that constituted the pickup 's cargo ; up front , in the cab , the timers lay in a sack at his feet . Knight studied Mukhtar 's impassive face , upon which years of driving through sun and sand had etched a permanent scowl . Dark , with two black holes for eyes and dominated by large nose only diminished somewhat by a fierce moustache that flared upward , it was not a face designed to encourage conversation . They rode in silence .  | Seven hours later , Mukhtar stopped the truck . He turned to Knight and said , " You go in back . Soldiers ahead . " Knight , made up as dark as the driver and dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , hiked up his burnoose , and jumped from the cab . Climbing over the olive oil drums , he crouched in a corner and pulled a dirty tarpaulin over his head . He could barely breathe . Minutes later , the truck slowed down and coasted to a halt . He could hear the conversation between what sounded like two other men and Mukhtar . His limited Arabic only allowed him to make out the general sense of what they said . After the usual greetings , one guard poked about desultorily in the back with his rifle butt while the other asked if Mukhtar were n't tired of passing off that inferior oil as first-rate to the poor country folk . It was plainly a running joke between them . Mukhtar swore by Allah that his merchandise was first-class and that as an observant Moslem he would not dream of cheating his fellow man . The guards answered derisively and asked what the news was in Bengazi . The news , Mukhtar reported , was the same as usual . In Bengazi , as elsewhere , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The guards laughed , then waved him on . The truck pulled slowly away , bouncing Knight mercilessly about . He threw off the tarpaulin as soon as he could and wiped his face on a sleeve of the burnoose . Minutes before the sun set , Mukhtar tortured the brakes and brought the truck to a screeching halt . While the motor idled , he leaned across Knight and pointed through the window into the distance . " Six kilometers . Three guards . I pick you up here tomorrow morning , nine o'clock , ten o'clock . " Knight slung the sack of timers over his shoulder , leaped from the cab , and retrieved the plastic from the back . He thanked Mukhtar and promised to see him in the morning . The Arab grunted and urged the truck on . The sun was down , plunging the desert temperature a good twenty degrees in less than an hour , as Knight quickly consulted a compass and headed in the direction Mukhtar had indicated . It took him almost two hours to cover the six kilometers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skeletal buildings ahead , alongside some construction equipment . According to  | his information , the airstrip was several hundred feet west of the main building , although he could not see it . The main building and dormitory were guarded by a lone soldier dressed in a westerntype army uniform . No problem , Knight thought , as he soundlessly lowered the timers to the ground and unlooped the plastic from around his shoulders . It would be wise to rest since he had all night and his legs still ached from the effort of slogging through sand . He sat in the desert and massaged them . When he felt ready , he reached into the galabiya under his burnoose for the knives . He chose one and began to move toward the building again . Except for a sliver of moonlight , the darkness was total . It was cooler than he had expected and a wind was stirring up the sand , stinging his bare legs . He made his way to the eastern wall of the uncompleted main structure . The important thing would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his job , the guard walked his post counterclockwise in a most unmilitary manner , holding his rifle droopingly by the barrel in one hand at his side , almost trailing it in the sand . Knight , hugging the wall more from habit than necessity , inched his way clockwise along the building 's east side , stopping just before the southeast corner . At that moment , the guard was on the west side of the building , slowly rounding the southwest corner . He leaned his rifle against the building and leisurely urinated into the sand . The sound brought a rueful smile to Knight 's lips ; he disappeared into a break in the wall where a door would eventually be installed , and waited . Minutes later the guard turned the southeastern corner and began his walk along the eastern wall . A third of the way , he dropped his rifle in surprise as he felt his knees buckle under pressure from behind and saw , for an instant only , something shimmer in the moonlight . He tried to shout but his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear to ear . He wanted desperately to scratch it , but it was too late . The last sound he heard was a soft thud , then sand flooded his mouth and his eyes locked open , staring sightlessly into the night . Knight plunged the knife into the sand several times and , without haste , wiped it clean against the guard 's blouse . He picked up the plastic and timers where he had dropped them and moved methodically through the two buildings , then outside  | among the construction equipment that included an earth-mover , two tractors , a derrick and a cement mixer ; and finally into a large tent that housed an assortment of building materials . As each charge was placed , he embedded a timer into the doughy plastic , setting each for one hour ; then he made for the airstrip . He took the last fifty feet on his stomach , wriggling along the sand , dragging his equipment behind him . Theoretically , the two guards walked the length of the strip in opposite directions but parallel to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile apart . But in practice , they did less than one-fourth their duty until dawn when an officer came to check on them . Still , in the darkness they were far enough apart at one point to allow Knight to deal with them separately . An artificial rise had been constructed to support the strip and it was along this rise that Knight lay prone , awaiting his chance . He wanted to take the guard closest to him first , then attend to the one across the strip . While he waited , he looked at the control tower . It appeared to rest on four concrete pillars , easy enough to demolish . The guard was approaching now , walking rhythmically if without enthusiasm along the strip . As he turned , thirty feet away , Knight stood up , relying on the darkness for camouflage , and reached for a knife . He crouched slightly and seemed merely to point his right arm toward the upright figure . The guard snapped to surprised attention , then fell to his knees as if in prayer . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he pitched slowly forward . Knight retrieved the knife , wiped it clean and rolled the body off the strip , down the slight incline . One more to go . He melted into the sand . The second guard appeared minutes later . " Bashir ? " he called . " Bashir ? " He strained to see across the strip . " Bashir ! " he yelled . Rifle at port arms , he double-timed over the runway , calling out his friend 's name . Knight rose like a desert apparition . " No Bashir tonight , " he said , snapping his arm at the guard who was already raising his rifle to his shoulder . The blade entered his throat , eliciting a gurgling protest , and snapped his head back . He toppled like a tree , his rifle clattering onto the cement . Knight extracted the knife and wiped it on the dead man 's leg as if he were buttering it .  | The charges were in place in less than five minutes , the timers set for fifty minutes . Knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trek back toward the road . It was 1:45 A.M. He had covered almost three kilometers when the first blast lit up the sky behind him . In rapid succession , twenty-two separate explosions rent the desert stillness . He turned to watch . Silhouetted against the flames and flying debris , he could make out the control tower lifting into the air , pausing , then collapsing to earth , like an unsuccessful rocket launch . The noise was deafening , but in that vast expanse of uninhabited desert , his were the only ears to hear it . He wondered what the workmen coming in on the helicopters in the morning would think . True to his word , Mukhtar coaxed the pickup to the appointed spot at 9:40 . " Good morning , " Knight said lightly , climbing into the cab . The Arab grunted and shifted into first . Two hours later it was again necessary to climb into the back of the truck . Almost spitefully , it seemed , Mukhtar was in a gossiping mood  --  his conversation with the two road guards dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarpaulin .. . ... he thrashed beneath the blanket , threw it off , awoke perspiring and momentarily wondered where he was , part of the price he paid for the life he led . How many airports , how many hotels , how many languages , currencies , identities had he rushed through , slept in , spoken , spent , assumed in the last six years ? How far might he have gone , he mused , if he had stuck to corporation law ? But he harbored no regrets . The pettiness . The bottom-line mentality . The spirit-sapping routine . Better to move , to act , to do . That was why he had left the company after less than two years and sought to join the FBI . One day he had been called from the pistol range and after innumerable interviews and ever more detailed screenings , finally , irrevocably been recruited for GVC . He turned , saw Laura , and recalled , with pleasure , how they had met . He had picked her up , pure and simple , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was killing time and she had rushed into the store , almost into his arms , seek-  | ing refuge , wearing a thoroughly soaked green scarf over her head and a very wet raincoat . She was willowy and lovely and startled by the stranger whom she had literally bumped into . He accepted her apology in his best Groucho Marx accent . She was amused , then charmed , and accepted the dinner invitation extended in the suave tones of Cary Grant . Almost too good to be true , she turned nut to be as bright as she was beautiful . Ile had slept with her two nights later and felt the closest thing to love he had ever experienced . He was her first lover , he knew ; he hoped he was also her only one . What , he wondered , would become of them ? She stirred and , seeing him awake , asked sleepily what it was . " Nothing , " he replied , and took her in his arms . They did n't talk at breakfast . There was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them . Ile was the first to break the silence . " I 'll have six weeks ' vacation coming after this assignment . " " Good . " " Then maybe reassignment to the States . I 'm due . " " There are no obligations , Jim . Or commitments . " " I know . " " I do n't want you to feel trapped . " " I do n't . " He yearned to tell her everything , something , but it was out of the question . Instead , he asked to borrow her car . She reached into her purse and handed him the keys . " The registration is clipped to the sun visor . " " I 'll leave them with Eddie . " " Fine . " She rose to go . " Will I see you again this trip ? " " Doubtful . " " Well , then . " She walked around the table and leaned toward him . He pulled her onto his lap and kissed her for a long time . But she stiffened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I really have to go . The car pool will be waiting . Make sure the door 's locked when you leave . We 've been having a lot of burglaries . Goodbye , Jim . " The door closed behind her . He was studying his coffee , thinking how unfair it was , when the  | door reopened . She slammed it shut and leaned against it , staring at him through damp eyes . Surprised , he rose , and suddenly they were embracing . " No , " she said , pushing him away . " Listen to me . You 've been turning my life inside out ever since we met . I did n't need or want anybody until you came along . I was going to stand on my own two feet and be strong and brave and independent , and  --  and probably thrifty too for all I know , but you 've changed all that . You 've turned me into a silly kid who ca n't even catch her breath when you 're around . When I see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you leave , I wonder when I 'll see you again . One minute I could kill you and the next I worry if you 're taking care of yourself . " She closed her eyes . " You 're driving me crazy  --  and " ? she looked up at him and shook her head miserably ? " I do n't know what I 'm saying anymore ... oh , Jim , I 'm sorry . Sometimes the bitch inside wins . " He kissed her softly and they clung to each other like lost children . " You do n't have to say anything . " " Come back to me soon . " " I will . " Alone again , feeling better , James Knight double-locked the door , lowered the shades and snapped on the lights . Swiftly , he sized up the living room . About twenty feet long . Out of his suitcase he took two objects : an oblong wooden case and a two-inchthick canvas-covered cork disk one foot in diameter , divided into four equal parts by two intersecting white lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released a thirty-six-inch telescopic tripod and a long slender tube , also telescopic , from which a counterweight was suspended . He extended the tripod and set it up against one wall . Then he extended the tube upward as far as it would go , like an ndoor television antenna . He slid the disk up the rod and clamped it to the top . Reaching behind the tripod , he wound a key until he felt maximum pressure . The wooden case opened with a snap ; in form-fitting niches lay six stainless steel knives , each precisely eight and one-half inches long . They had been forged and tempered for him in Sheffield , England , perfectly balanced and painstakingly tailored to his grip . The **25;848;TOOLONG blades were all cutting edge , regularly honed to razor sharpness with a carborundum stick .  | He preferred knives to other weapons because they were silent and quick , extensions of oneself . There was no room for selfexpression or pride in a gun . He slipped into his suit jacket . A light tap set the cork disk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it arced back and forth . He picked up two knives , one in each hand , and walked to the opposite side of the room , his back to the target . Body tensed , he thought : Two and three . In a half crouch , he whirled around , his arms snapping out in front of him . He seemed merely to be pointing at the disk as two silver blurs crossed one above the other in the middle of the room . The disk continued to arc silently back and forth , but it had grown two knife handles from its second and third quadrants . It is not enough to aim , Jimmy , Gregory had told him many times . You must see in your head exactly where you want it , then think it there and throw . When the knife obeys what your mind sees , then you will be a knife thrower . How do you think a knife to its target , Gregory ? It will simply happen one day and you will understand . Keep throwing , Jimmy ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Think it to the target , Jimmy . Then , one day , as Gregory had predicted , it happened . Jimmy Knight , age thirteen , and the knife and the target became one smooth process . Before it ever left his hand , he knew the precise path the knife would follow in the air , could see it quiver in the target ; throwing the knife was the least of it . It was true , and Jimmy finally understood ; you thought the knife to its target . He had done so ever since . He examined the target critically and picked up two more knives . On his way to the far side of the room , he looked carefully at the disk , positioning it in his mind , then turned off the lights . Again , his back to the target , he whispered , " One and four , " spun around and , in the darkness , snapped his arms . There was a sound of muted whips slashing through the air and two soft thups . He turned on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four .  | As he had done almost every day of the last six years , and somewhat less frequently for fifteen years before that , James Knight practiced his knife throwing . That was one of the skills that had recommended him to GVC . Satisfied with his performance , he dismantled his target , showered for the second time that morning , and packed his belongings . He made sure the apartment door was locked , then took the elevator to the basement garage and Laura 's car . Forty minutes later , suitcase in hand , he stood in front of a GVC receptionist . " Mr. Knight for Mr. Harcourt , " he told her . " You 're expected , " she said . A young man came out of Harcourt 's office carrying a black bag . To Knight it was a familiar piece of equipment , signifying the completion of an electronic sweep . Real hush-hush , he thought . Might be interesting . He entered without knocking . Harcourt rose from behind his desk and extended his hand . " Good to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man stood next to a loaded 16-millimeter motion picture projector . Harcourt did not introduce them . James Knight instantly pegged the projectionist as CIA , so ordinary looking in his white shirt , dark suit , wing-tipped shoes and closely cropped hair that he was , in the end , extraordinary looking . Harcourt beckoned Knight to a chair behind the desk , next to himself , then nodded to the projectionist , who lowered the blinds . The lights clicked off and the projector whirred softly in the darkness . On a screen opposite the desk , a lean man wearing a tweed sports jacket over a dark turtleneck sweater stepped out of a limousine and began climbing the marble steps of an imposing building , followed by another man . The man in the turtleneck had a mop of unruly gray hair , interrupted only by a small bald spot in back . The CIA agent narrated : " Our subject is the first man , Leon Fedorovich Beshlenkov , Nobel laureate in physiology for his work on artificial hormones . Born 1918 in Baku , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoemaker . Demonstrated scientific bent early in life , especially a keen interest in biology . Earned all degrees at Leningrad University , including doctorate in biochemistry in 1939 . Taught at Univer-36  | sity of Kharkov in the Ukraine until 1950 , with time out for military service . In 1951 , invited to join Institute of Problems of Biochemistry in Academy of Sciences , where he has worked ever since . In Name year , at age thirty-three , elected member of Academy of Science of the USSR , an honor usually reserved for scientists in their fifties and sixties . " On the screen , Beshlenkov had reached the top of the steps and was shaking hands with a stout woman dressed in a laboratory smock . The CIA agent continued : " Recipient of numerous awards , including the Stalin Prize , 1952 , and two Orders of Lenin , 1956 and 1962 . Nobel Prize , 1967 . Member in good standing of learned societies in the United States , Great Britain , France , the Netherlands and Denmark . A certifiable genius , sometimes called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . This film is sixteen months old . " Beshlenkov and the woman were smiling and waving at the camera when the screen went blank . The film slapped gradually to a stop . The agent flicked on the lights and rewound the film . " Any questions ? " he asked Knight . " Does he speak English ? " " Yes . And German , too . That 's all . " " Is he in good health ? " " For a man his age , yes . " " Meaning . . . ? " " He ca n't leap tall buildings in a single bound , but he 's in as good shape as you can expect an academic in his sixties to be . " " Any recent still shots of him available ? " " In the dossier . " The agent pointed at a blue folder on Harcourt 's desk . " But they 're not too recent . Maybe a year , a year and a half old . Beshlenkov is something of a recluse and the government encourages it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent lifted the projector into its carrying case and snapped it shut with his thumbs . He glanced at Harcourt . " Will that be all , sir ? " " I believe so . Thank you very much . " The agent nodded curtly at Knight on his way out .  | Knight turned to Harcourt . " Now , " he asked , although he had guessed the answer as soon as the film began , " what am I supposed to do with  --  or is it to  --  Comrade Beshlenkov ? " Harcourt ignored the question , concentrating instead on rotating a silver letter opener slowly between his fingers ; without lifting his gaze , he spoke . " When did you arrive ? " " Three hours ago , " Knight lied . " Pan Am Flight Three-oh-one . " " No , James , " Harcourt said , shaking his head and opening a drawer . " You did not . " He read from a piece of paper in the drawer . " You landed at Dulles International Airport at fourteen-fifty hours yesterday on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab number two-seven-three-one-four , driven by one Horace Wilson , to Three twenty-eight Creedmore Place , Silver Spring , Maryland , arriving there at sixteen-twelve hours . At seventeenfifty hours , Laura Meredith 's roommate , Sally Piedmont , left to stay with a friend , Doris Maloney , of Twenty-eight Third Street , apartment forty-seven . At eighteen thirty-eight hours you and Miss Meredith entered Julio 's Restaurant , where you had dinner . You took a brief walk afterward and were back in the apartment by twenty-one hundred hours . You stayed the night . This morning , Miss Meredith and you had a misunderstanding of some sort , but appear to have made up . You borrowed her car , a red nineteen seventy-six Nova , and you will be returning the keys to Edward McCormick , the elevator operator . " A look of resignation settled over James Knight 's face . " Are all the bugs out of her apartment now ? " Harcourt consulted his watch . " As of thirty minutes ago . " He looked at Knight . " Do n't ever try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's too much at stake in our line of business . " He laid the letter opener on the desk , positioning it precisely parallel with the blotter edge . Knight felt the anger build up in him ; he leaned confidentially toward Harcourt . " You 're absolutely right , " he said in an even voice . " But please remember this . I have a private life and right now that 's definable as Miss Laura Meredith . You leave her alone ; you leave her apartment alone ; you leave her friends alone . You 38  | call off your bird dogs or I 'll break their kneecaps . I really will . " He gave a mirthless grin and held it for a long time , gazing steadily into Harcourt 's face . Harcourt appeared unperturbed . But his left cheek twitched as he spoke . " We do not intend to harass Miss Meredith , I assure you . But you will agree that GVC can not afford to be compromised . " " There is no danger from that direction . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Would you object to our investigating the lady ? " " Come off it , Harcourt ! By now , you must know Laura Meredith from the moment she was conceived . " Harcourt neither confirmed nor denied the charge . He merely issued a statement : " She appears to be a proper young lady . But , " he added , " who knows better than Rainbow that people are not always what they appear to be ? " " Let 's drop it . What about Beshlenkov ? " " We want him here . " " Does he want to come ? " " He does . " " That helps . Any suggestions ? " Harcourt told him about the Vienna conference and the time frame within which he had to work . " We 'll get word to him to expect an  --  ah  --  escort in Vienna . We 're willing to pull out all the stops on this one , James . If necessary , you can even have the help of another GVC agent . " Knight whistled softly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I prefer to work alone . " Harcourt wrote a number down on a piece of paper and handed it to him . " Memorize that , " he said . " It 's a telephone number in Vienna . Should you need anything  --  anything , James  --  dial that number and ask for it . Preface your request with the phrase , in English or German , I hope I have the right number . ' If the telephone is answered before or after it has rung precisely four times , break the connection ; something will be wrong . " Harcourt plucked the paper out of Knight 's hand and set a match to it in a 39  | large crystal ashtray ; he stirred the ashes with the letter opener . " Now I suggest you acquaint yourself with your target . " He slid the dossier along the desk . Knight picked it up and leafed through the contents : a chronology of Beshlenkov 's life ; a physical description ; a psychological profile ; some newspaper and magazine clippings ; and three eightby-ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , Beshlenkov sat profiled at a crowded table , with a cigarette poised in mid-air , listening attentively to the man opposite him . In another , he peered curiously out of a sedan . In the third , he was walking in the street . One fact was clear from all three pictures : Beshlenkov was never alone . Always , next to him was at least one other man , most likely KGB . They were as easy to spot as the CIA . Knight dropped the last photograph into the folder . " We want him badly , I take it . " " We do . " " Why ? " ? " It is n't necessary for you to have that information . " Harcourt 's reply was not unexpected ; GVC never told an agent more than he absolutely had to know , for obvious reasons : the less he knew , the less he could divulge , willingly or otherwise . " But I can tell you one thing , " Harcourt volunteered . " We ? you  --  have absolute carte blanche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Knight . " Absolute , " he repeated . " Pretty important guy , our bushy-haired friend ? " Harcourt removed his glasses and polished them with the lining of his tie in silence . When he finally spoke , his chin was almost resting on his chest . " Leon Beshlenkov , " he said in a low voice , " is the most important man on earth . "  | Lufthansa Flight 17 , destination Frankfurt am Main , nosed smoothly into the air at precisely 4:05 P.M. , only ten minutes behind schedule . The Boeing 737 climbed quickly , executed a slow bank into the sun and was lost above cumulus clouds minutes later . Soon it was at cruising speed , seven miles above the ocean . James Knight had checked his baggage , but held the buff envelope containing the Beshlenkov dossier in his hand . Overhead the No SMOKING and FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELT signs blinked off . For the sake of privacy , he left his aisle seat next to a solemn-looking German businessman and walked back toward the tail section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the washrooms he chose a bound copy of Der Spiegel and slid into a row of unoccupied seats , settling into the one next to the window . He reached into the envelope and withdrew the physical description of Beshlenkov , together with the three photographs . He shuffled and reshuffled the pictures , finally settling on the one in which the scientist peered out of an automobile window . He opened his magazine and set the photograph down in it , where he could study it at leisure . From under gray tufted eyebrows , Leon Fedorovich Beshlenkov gazed silently back at James Knight . Intelligent eyes , he thought . High forehead , broad nose , full lips ; all signified nothing . Simply a scholarly-looking man , for all Knight could determine , who looked as if he ought to be crossbreeding roses in a hothouse somewhere , not getting involved in the lunacy of international intrigue . Those eyes . Magnetic . Knight found himself returning to them again and again . Deep-set , even through the graininess of the enlargement they strongly hinted that there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The physical description added three facts : the subject stood five feet , seven inches tall , weighed approximately 148 pounds , and bore no visible scars . While James Knight was studying the photograph of Leon Fedorovich Beshlenkov at thirty-six thousand feet , twenty-two  | thousand miles above him a half-ton satellite was relaying a telephone call from Washington , D.C. , to a small office on Kalverstraat in Amsterdam . To anyone listening in , the conversation would have sounded innocuous enough . But the slim young man sitting at a scarred wooden desk with the receiver shouldered to his ear wore a very intent expression . He jotted down what he heard on a pad , occasionally asking his caller to speak more slowly . Some questions he asked more than once . And would the caller please confirm certain numbers ? Finally he said , " Understood . " After he hung up , he examined his notes . Painstakingly rewriting them , he left wide spaces between the lines . Then he crossed out certain words and wrote others above them . The entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the message through , then reread it to be sure he had missed nothing . The corners of his mouth curled down with astonishment , but he nodded slowly , as if in agreement . When he stood up , he was surprisingly tall , for , like most tall people , much of his height was in his legs and thighs . He stuffed the message into a pocket . As the last person to leave the office  --  it was 9:42 P.M. ? it fell to him to turn out the lights . He moved with a special grace , this tall thin man of twenty-seven , as he walked from office to office , leaving darkness in his wake . Like a dancer . James Knight slipped the photograph back into the envelope and extracted the psychological profile . He pulled down his shade to cut out a blinding ray of sunlight and , from his arm control , flicked on the overhead lamp . A cone of light splashed onto his lap . He began to read . Leon Fedorovich Beshlenkov , the only child of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep desire to learn so characteristic of his people . A voracious reader , he soon demonstrated the independent turn of mind that has marked his entire career by refusing to attend Hebrew school , much to the dismay of his parents and the Jewish community in which they lived . He preferred learning about worldly things , " gentile things , " in the living languages in which they were described : Russian , German and , later , English .  | Although his parents were distressed by his lack of religious orientation , his intellectual accomplishments were a source of great pride to them and , to the extent that they could , they spoiled the boy . The death of his mother , whom he adored , in premature childbirth , December , 1927 , when he was nine , was the major trauma of Beshlenkov 's life . The resulting lack of opportunity to work out the Oedipal situation satisfactorily may account , in part at least , for his unmarried status . He is definitely not homosexual , however , a fact underscored by a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a nutshell , he thought , Beshlenkov is Jewish  --  though not very  --  and he 's straight . Not too helpful . He glanced over several more pages until one paragraph arrested his attention . He is totally apolitical , paying scant attention to the ideological differences that divide nations . Among his published writings is the statement " Politics gives little men a chance to tinker with institutions , which are evanescent . Such tinkering interests me not a whit . I deal solely with the laws of nature , Truth itself , eternal and immutable , sometimes awesome , always beautiful . " Beshlenkov 's disdain for politicians is well known in the USSR ; he has not hesitated to criticize his own government 's suppression of the spirit of free inquiry . A lesser man would have been severely punished , perhaps eliminated , by the authorities . As a bona fide national treasure , Beshlenkov is , in a sense , beyond the law . Knight skipped to the last paragraph on page five . Intellectually , Beshlenkov is without peer in his field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind may best be described metaphorically . If the average person can be said to reason from A to B to C to D and the above-average to skip occasionally from A to C to E , Beshlenkov 's extraordinary mind permits him to reason in gigantic leaps , from A to K to R to Z , and in less time than most of us take to trudge from A to B to C. The result , predictably , is a lack of patience with pedestrian minds and , often , an intellectual arrogance that does not attract friends . Beshlenkov has been quoted as saying , " As a scientist I dare not permit prejudice to cloud my vision . Yet I freely admit to one terrible bias  --  I  | can not abide stupidity . " Since almost everyone else is stupid relative to him , his general opinion of the human race may be inferred . His refusal to attend the Nobel ceremonies , even though the Soviet government was prepared to permit him to travel to Stockholm , was a symbolic gesture of contempt toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has no close friends . Beshlenkov is the classic loner . Knight turned to the final page . Habits . A chain-smoker of cigarettes . When reading or in deep thought , twists hair of sideburns between thumb and forefinger . Fast eater , often finishing meals while others are still in the middle of theirs , traceable perhaps to the demands of laboratory life . An expert chess player . Enjoys Englishlanguage crossword puzzles , which he works out to improve his vocabulary . A devotee of the music of Mozart . Definitely not your average Joe , Knight thought , slipping the profile back into the envelope . Clearly , if Beshlenkov only had something we wanted , we would n't have to spirit him bodily out of Vienna ; it could be passed to someone else and smuggled out in any of a thousand different ways . It 's his brain we seem to need so badly . Something he and he alone knows or understands is crucial to the vital interests of the United States . A tantalizing mental exercise , trying to pinpoint what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as Harcourt had pointed out , not really essential to the success of the mission . James Knight tucked the dossier under his belt and switched off the overhead light ; he adjusted the seat , leaned back and closed his eyes . There would be much to do . He would be in Munich tomorrow , Thursday , the thirty-first . He should get to Vienna no later than Friday afternoon . More than likely , delegates to the convention would be arriving all through the weekend . He 'd need at least one day to see what procedures the convention followed , what programs were scheduled , to get acquainted with the hotel , its entrances and exits , the streets , the traffic flow . Another day to arrange for whatever special equipment might be required . That put him into the morning of the sixth . The convention ended on Friday , the eighth , more than likely at noon . A lot of confusion then : bills being paid ; goodbyes being said ; heavy traffic in the lobby and in the streets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially alert . Tentative conclusion : however he got Beshlenkov , barring a stroke of exceptional good fortune , it would have to occur between the morning of the sixth and noon of the eighth . He would be able to tell better in Vienna . He set his watch to Munich time and dozed . A stewardess , crisp looking in her uniform , awakened him gently for supper . He ate sparingly ; on assignment he invariably lost his appetite . The airplane had passed beneath the sun long ago and night had fallen over the Atlantic . When he raised his shade , all was blackness outside . The interior of the plane was dark , too ; a movie was being shown . Scattered vertical beams of light marked the readers among the passengers . The hum of low conversations in two languages drifted over seats , across aisles , grew softer , trailed off . As quiet as nuns , the stewardesses made their last rounds , collecting trays , passing out pillows and blankets to those who requested them . Somewhere up front a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended ; earplugs were tucked into elastic pockets , magazines laid aside . The last beams of light were extinguished and eighty-two people fell asleep at last . The eighty-third remained awake . He rested his forehead against the cold window and stared into the night . Right now , he thought , somewhere in the vastnesses of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , probably sleeping , was a remarkable man he had never met , never even heard of until yesterday . Soon their paths , their very lives , would intersect , join for a time , separate . .. if they were lucky . He studied his own darkling image in the window for a long time . Slowly at first , then more insistently , the vague shadow of an idea , fuzzy , inchoate , began to scurry about inside his head , like a small animal seeking to be free . He did not remember falling asleep , but instinctively opened his eyes at 4:15 A.M. , anticipating by seconds the captain 's announcement that they would be landing in forty-five minutes . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returned to his seat next to the German businessman . The plane touched down smoothly ; taxied , it seemed , forever ; finally came to a whining , reluctant halt . Fifty-five minutes later he was in another plane , Munich-bound . By 7:25 A.M. , local time , he had claimed his suitcase and been waved through customs by an inspector who knew him well .  | " Grass Gott , Herr Knight , " the inspector had said , automatically chalking his suitcase and executing a sloppy salute with two fingers . As James Knight shouldered his way through the crowd at Munich Airport , heading through a light drizzle toward a taxi stand , a keen observer might have noticed that his gait was somehow different from what it had been twelve hours before : firmer , swifter , more purposeful .  | Entering the city from the east , a rain-dappled black Mercedes taxi , wipers silently sweeping its windshield , sped along l'rinzregentenstrasse . By the time it crossed the Isar River and turned north , a heavy rain was pelting Munich ; umbrellas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes into Ludwigstrasse Knight tapped the driver 's shoulder . " N &chste; links , bitte , " he said , pointing to a narrow side street . The cab veered sharply heft and headed into the heart of Schwabing , the artists ' and students ' quarter of the city . Minutes later it pulled up in front of a large archway leading to a darkened courtyard formed by six apartment buildings . Knight paid the driver , lifted his collar against the slanting rain and walked swiftly across the cobbled inner court . He turned at the second building on the right and jogged up six stone steps worn smooth by time . His apartment was two flights up , comfortable enough for a bachelor who traveled often and entertained almost never . There were three high-ceilinged rooms , a large bathroom , and two pairs of floor-to-ceiling glass doors , partially curtained , that afforded a view of the University to the west and , beyond it , of the English Gardens . One wall held shelves piled high with books , records and a stereo set . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the creative and the young because of the easy spirit of laissez faire that prevailed . His irregular comings and goings raised no eyebrows , triggered no questions in Schwabing . He unpacked quickly and made himself a cup of instant coffee , which he carried to an open rolltop desk tucked into a corner of the living room . By the light of a green gooseneck lamp , he jotted down on a pad of paper what he would need to set his plan in motion . After checking it and adding a note to himself , he looked at his watch : 9:17 A.M. The office would be open ; Ferguson was always prompt . He reached for the phone and dialed his office ; a man answered .  | " I 'm back , Fergy . Let 's scramble . " There was momentary static on the line . Then : " Anything I should know about ? Messages ? " " Good to hear your voice . No , not a bloody thing ; very routine , very quiet . But you only left a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not today . I 'll be traveling again soon and there are preparations to be made . Besides , I 'm tired . " " Everything all right at the home office ? " " Buzzing along . An interesting import situation has developed and I 'll be out of town for a while . " " Anything I can do to help ? " " As a matter of fact , there are several things . For openers , pick up two round-trip plane tickets to Vienna for tomorrow . " He sipped his coffee . " Then reserve a room for two at the Hotel Wien for a week under my name . Got that ? " " Yep . Any time preference on the flight ? " " Just get us there before dark . Leave the return trip openended . " " Us ? " " Sure . Marianne can cover the office . Got anything against Vienna ? " " Nothing at all . How long are we going to be there ? " " Tell you tomorrow morning at eight , when you bring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave from the apartment , so pack tonight . One suitcase should do . And do n't forget your passport . " " Anything else ? " " Yes ; very important . Call Hartmut . Tell him we 'll require his services tomorrow morning , around ten-thirty , at my apartment . It 'll be a rush passport job ; I 'll provide the paper . " " You got it . " " See you tomorrow , then . " " Eight sharp . " " Eight sharp . " He hung up , smiling at the surprise he had in store for Ferguson . He stretched with fatigue ; a bath would hit the spot , he decided , and drew the kind he enjoyed , hot and deep . He slid into the oversized tub slowly , allowing the water to cover him by degrees , until his chin rested in it . Perspiration beaded his forehead . A simple plan , he thought , is always superior to a complicated one for the  | same reason a knife is superior to a gun : fewer parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed an imaginary blade at his big toe . He shut his left eye and flicked his wrist . Hang in there , Leon Fedorovich . Dressed in jeans and a soft woolen shirt under a tan raincoat , and cleanly shaven , James Knight could almost have passed for a student as he entered the art supplies store just off Konradstrasse , where he purchased several soft sketching pencils , a pad of tracing paper and an art gum eraser . His next stop was in a haberdashery for a pair of men 's kid gloves . It was slightly more difficult to obtain the last item on his list , but eventually a pharmacy yielded exactly what he was looking for . Suddenly hungry , he stopped at a cafe where he washed down two servings of weisswurst with a stein of what was , beyond argument , the finest beer in the world . In the apartment again , he set his purchases down on the kitchen table , drew the curtains , and rummaged through the bottom of a bureau drawer . From it he extracted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untangled them and stripped off his shirt . Each strap consisted of two leather loops , one slightly larger than the other , six and one-half inches apart and connected by a curved inch-wide length of flexible leather . Imbedded in this connecting strip was a thin black piece of metal . He slipped his right hand through the larger loop , working it up his forearm and twisting it so that the connecting strip fell along the underside of his forearm , extending from just above the wrist to just below the elbow ; then he worked his hand and wrist through the smaller loop . When he let his arm drop to his side , the leather strip and the magnet in it lay against his body . In the same way , he worked the second strip over his left forearm . From their wooden case , he took two knives and carefully positioned one against each magnet . They locked into place . He opened a closet door and viewed himself critically in a full-length mirror . Arms at his sides , he snapped and , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knife slipped off the magnet , blade first , and was in his palm , ready for use . He tested the left strap ; satisfied , he reset the knives . Hanging in a closet were several short-sleeved shirts . He slipped into one , buttoned it and carefully donned a wide-cuffed sports jacket . From a closet shelf he took down a new target and set it up  | in a corner of the living room . When it was in motion , he walked to the corner diagonally opposite , a distance of 28 feet . Knees bent , with one uninterrupted lightning motion he released the knife from his right forearm , snapped his right arm parallel with the floor and watched the blade flash across the room and embed itself into the precise center of the target , where the lines intersected . At that very moment Klaus Gratz , an archeology student , was walking through the hall on his way to the rooms he shared with a nubile dental assistant named Rita . The familiar sound that he was never able to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then a pause . Thup-thup . Pause . Thup-thup . Gratz listened for a while , shrugged , continued on his way , wondering if Rita might be in the mood . She almost always was . When the practice session was over , Knight put his equipment away , undressed and went to bed , falling asleep almost immediately to the drumming of the rain against the windows . It was dark when he awoke , and the rain had stopped . The luminous hands of the electric clock on his night table indicated 10:25 ; he had slept for more than nine hours . Sitting up , he scratched his head . The long sleep was just as well , he thought ; he would need to be alert for the next few hours . He swung out of bed , groped with his feet for his slippers , grabbed a blue terry cloth robe hanging on a door hook and made for the kitchen , where he prepared himself a cup of instant coffee . He carried it to the desk , scooping up the art supplies from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dossier he extracted the photograph he had studied on the plane . Tearing off a sheet of tracing paper from the pad , he laid it over the picture and , with a soft pencil , carefully reproduced the outline of the Russian scientist 's head and hair . Propping the photograph against the desk lamp , he placed the tracing on the desk . His eyes shifted rapidly from the picture to the tracing and back as he erased the outline of the hair and deftly sketched in a new hairline , beginning lower on the forehead . Under Knight 's pencil , the hair became softly waved , with a part on the left side ; the sideburns lengthened , blending into a full beard ; the temple areas grew bushier . He slipped the photograph under the tracing paper again and lightly drew in Beshlenkov 's eyes , nose and mouth . Not too bad for a first try but , as he sus-  | pected , the nose would have to be altered . He erased it on the tracing paper and experimented with a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on a second drawing . A great number of sheets of tracing paper were crumpled as the night wore on ; his wastebasket gradually filled , then overflowed , with discarded versions of the Russian : bald Beshlenkovs , whitehaired Beshlenkovs , tousled Beshlenkovs ; Beshlenkovs with pouches under their eyes , moustaches of every description , cheeks ranging from gaunt to full . There were Beshlenkovs with bulbous noses , wrinkled faces and jowls . On some Beshlenkovs the skin hung loosely ; on others it was covered with hair . A collection of cups and glasses , partially filled with coffee , stood piled up on the desk and its immediate environs when James Knight , dissatisfied , stood up and began to pace the living room . Something was wrong . Okay , he thought , time to review the bidding . Question : What do we have here ? Answer : A hot Russian whose features must be altered . Question : Why must his features be altered ? Answer : So we can get him out of the hotel unnoticed , right past his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best way to do that ? Answer : Make him look so ordinary , so run-of-the-mill that ? Wrong , dummy ! Suddenly inspired , Knight returned to the desk and , in less than ten minutes , sketched a picture of the face behind which he hoped Leon Fedorovich Beshlenkov would saunter out of the Hotel Wien under the very nose of the KGB . It was 1:15 A.M. , Friday , the first of April . He stood up and , reaching for them alternately , massaged the muscles of his shoulders . The last sketch lay face upward on the desk . Knight stared down at it , allowing a faint smile to play across his face . " April fool , " he said . When the knock on the door came , he was already dressed and working on his second cup of morning coffee . He carried it with him , opening the door while sipping .  | Matt Ferguson , a medium-sized , fair-complexioned man with thinning dark hair , stood smiling in the hallway , a brown vinyl suitcase at his side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have some coffee ? " " I 've tasted your coffee , " Ferguson said with finality . Knight led the way to the kitchen table . " Ca n't offer you much more . I have n't had time to shop . " " That 's okay . Knowing your culinary limitations , I took the precaution of tucking away a decent breakfast . " " Got our tickets ? " Ferguson patted his breast pocket . " Plane leaves at three thirtyfive . We 're there in about an hour . " " Perfect . How 's business ? " " Surprisingly good . If GVC ever decides to go straight , it could make a fortune . " " That 's why we hire the Fergusons of the world . Gives us a touch of respectability . But enough chitchat . We have a lot to do and I 'm going to need your help . Let me give it to you in a nutshell . " The Irishman pulled his chair up to the table , clasped his hands in front of him and gave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special bond of understanding and mutual respect between the two , for they knew each other 's talents well . Knight , impatient with desk work and action oriented , found in Ferguson 's precision of mind and gift for commercial analysis the perfect balance required for a successful GVC operation . Ferguson appreciated the importance of Knight 's work and was happy to be able to use his business acumen for more important things than merely generating money . James Knight put the problem succinctly , then explained what he had in mind . " I want to take Beshlenkov out looking like this , " he said , handing the sketch to Ferguson . On the paper was a face not soon forgotten : gray hair slicked straight back , curling at the neck ; a fresh two-inch crescent scar on the right cheek ; a broken nose ; a small forked beard and moustache . " Ugly looking sonofabitch , is n't he ? " Ferguson said .  | " The important thing  --  the thing I failed to realize was important until early this morning  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our friend here once , you 're going to remember him , right ? " " That 's for sure . " " Now here 's where you come in , Fergy . " Knight watched for a reaction . " In order to take our memorable friend out of Vienna , we have to bring him in first . " Ferguson regarded Knight suspiciously . " We not only have to bring him in ; we 've got to let him be seen , give people in the hotel , guests and employees alike , an opportunity to get used to him . " " You mean I have to go to Vienna looking like that ? " " Exactly . " Ferguson looked dolefully at his friend . " Buck up , Fergy . Think how handsome you 'll feel when this is over . Shall we adjourn to makeup ? " On a small table in the bedroom lay the materials he would need , from grease paint in stick form and red sable brushes to liquid latex and a silk-net hairpiece . He sat Ferguson down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural light , since that would be the medium in which the bearded man would be seen most often . " Shirt off , Barrymore . " With a towel draped around his neck , Ferguson stared straight ahead . Knight set to work , providing a running description of what he was doing . " First we cleanse the face completely , " he said , swiftly smearing dabs of cleansing cream on the Irishman 's forehead , nose , cheeks and chin . He spread the cream evenly with his fingertips , then removed it with tissues . " Next , the wig . " Knight lifted the gray hairpiece , which he had prepared in advance , from a mannequin head and adjusted the silk net front on Ferguson 's head . " Fortunately , " Knight observed , " your hair is thin . I 'm afraid Leon Fedorovich is going to have to have a haircut for the return trip . " He combed the wig back and down , blending it with Ferguson 's own sideburns . When it was properly positioned , he gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange stick , carefully applied spirit gum underneath , all along it  | the front hairline.With a silk cloth , he pressed down on the glued portion of the wig until it was securely in place . " Since our Russian friend appears to be darker than you , I 'm going to deepen your skin coloring a shade or two . If necessary , I can lighten his to match later . " Using the blunt front end of the hard grease stick , Knight applied three wide streaks of paint across Ferguson 's forehead ; one down the nose ; another across each cheekbone ; one each on the upper lip , chin and line of the jaws ; and several down the neck . With his fingertips he gently spread the color so that it evenly covered the face and silk-net front of the wig up to the new hairline . He wiped his fingers dry with tissues , then moistened them and his palms with water . A few rapid pats removed all the excess grease from Ferguson 's face . " Comrade Beshlenkov has about twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sinking your temples and cheeks and adding a few telltale wrinkles . " Deftly he searched Ferguson 's face with his fingers , locating and following temple bones and the depressions between cheekline and jawbone . With the application and blending of shadow into the base , Ferguson 's appearance began to change ; his face looked thinner , longer , haggard . " When you 're an old man , " Knight explained , " not only is your face going to sink in ; your nose wrinkles will grow more pronounced , like this . " With a flat sable brush , starting just outside the nostril and following the curvature of the cheekline , he applied a small quantity of shadow mixture down to below the mouth , blending it toward the mouth first with the brush , then with a finger . An hour later , with eye pouches and wrinkles in place , Matt Ferguson looked like his own father . Knight made a fist and pulled it back menacingly . " Forgive me , Fergy , " he said , " but I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " the Irishman said , throwing his arms up defensively . " A little professional joke , " Knight laughed as he opened his fist to reach into the bag he had carried from the pharmacy . He extracted an infant 's pacifier and set it down on the table . From the right side of the bridge of Ferguson 's nose , he carried a sharp V angle of shadow down to the face and blended it . Then , with a stroke of shears , he snipped off the tip of the pacifier ; a second  | stroke separated the bulb from the body of the pacifier . He handed the bulbous rubber tube to Ferguson . " Put this on your little finger , " he said , " and insert it into your right nostril . " Ferguson did so gingerly . When the pacifier was in place , it pulled the nostril to the right . pl I " " Can you breathe comfortably ? " " I suppose so , " the Irishman muttered , distinctly unhappy . Knight applied some additional shading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down and into the left nostril . The tot at impression was of a severely dislocated nose . " Now for the scar . " With a brush dipped in liquid latex he drew a two-inch crescent line beginning about an inch below the right eye , ending two-thirds down the cheek . When it dried , Knight went over it with surgical adhesive , then added another coat of latex . The effect was to build up the irregular welting associated with sear tissue . The fastidious application of maroon and rouge colors on the dried final coat of latex yielded a facsimile scar of the first order . Knight backed away and took a hard , critical look at his work . 1k stepped forward twice to blend shadows more smoothly , then muttered , " Pretty damn good . " He picked up a powder puff , folded it and rolled some powder into it . Opening the puff , he lightly shook off the excess powder . Beginning at Ferguson 's neck , he patted a layer of powder onto the base , working his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he repeated the process until Ferguson 's entire face was covered with powder . " Damn it , Jim ! " " Take it easy . I 'm just setting the makeup . The powder comes off in a minute . " Ile shook the powder out of the puff , then folded it around his right index finger . With a rolling motion , he pressed and removed the excess powder from Ferguson 's new face , pausing occasionally shake the puff clean before proceeding . When he was finished , only a thin film of powder covered the makeup , which he patted off Nish a moist silk sponge . It only remained to add and trim the eyebrows , forked beard and otimstache . James Knight backed away and contemplated his work like a 55  | painter searching his work for flaws . " Care to meet Mr. Martin Duboff ? " He handed a mirror to Ferguson , who accepted it gingerly . " Jesus , Jim , " he said , marveling at his image . " You did n't think I spent all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's one problem , though .. . your hands . They 're only thirty-five years old and I do n't have time to age them . Try these . " He tossed the kid gloves to Ferguson . " Stand up , Fergy . " Ferguson rose with care , as if afraid his new face would fall off . " Put on your shirt and let 's see you walk . " Knight watched him make his way around the room . " No , no , " he said , " you 're walking like a cocky Irishman . Try doing it just a little more deliberately , as if the heels of your feet hurt , like this . " Knight demonstrated what he had in mind . " You 're taller than Beshlenkov , so we 'll have to fit him with lifts and they 'll affect his gait . If he 's going to walk out of Vienna in discomfort , you 're going to have to walk into Vienna the same way . " They rehearsed Ferguson 's walk until there was a knock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your first test . Stay here until I cue you . " Two hundred forty pounds of flesh named Hartmut Scharf stood panting in the doorway , pressing his heart with his right palm and panting when Knight opened the door . " Those damned steps , " he gasped in German , and with good reason ; he stood no more than an inch or two over five feet . Nevertheless , he insisted on dressing properly , although it was impossible to see much of his tie , covered as it was by chins . A black suit strained at the job of containing his girth . A Leica camera with dangling tripod hung askew around his neck , almost touching the gadget bag slung over his left shoulder . " I must sit down for a moment , Mr. Knight , " he said in English , allowing the gadget bag strap to slip into his waiting hand and waddling to a club chair . He fell into it , curling the corners of the cushion upward , and exhaled noisily through his mouth , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid down between his legs . " Mr. Ferguson  | said it was important , so here I am . But as you know , I do not . usually make house calls . " He shook his head from side to side in silent reaffirmation of his business principles . " I know , Hartmut , " Knight said , " and I appreciate your coming . I would never have imposed on your good nature if it were n't important . But time is essential and I need a passport in a great hurry . " Scharf extended his hands , palms upward . " Have I ever failed you ? " " Never . That 's why I had Mr. Ferguson call you . " " Of course . How soon will you want it ? " Knight glanced at his wristwatch . " In no more than three hours . " Scharf 's eyes brightened with the challenge . " I 'll need time to get back to my studio and develop the film . Then there is the enlarging and printing . The passport itself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary equipment . Still , we have n't a moment to lose . " He gripped the arms of the chair and leaned back to get the requisite momentum to rise . He rocked forward twice , gaining his feet on the second try . " Can I get you a drink ? " Knight offered . " A glass of water , please . " He finished the water in one extended gulp , then looked around the living room in puzzlement . " Ah , " he said , spotting the desk chair . " I 'll just place this in front of the wall , for the background . If you will sit here sideways , Mr. Knight ... " For a fat man , Scharf moved quickly as he set up his camera . " I 'm not the subject , " Knight said . " It 's a friend of mine . Let me introduce you . " Knight leaned into the bedroom and said , " Come in , Martin . There 's someone I 'd like you to meet . " Ferguson walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Duboff ... Mr. Scharf , Munich 's most outstanding photographer and unauthorized travel agent . " Ferguson gave his best Erich von Stroheim bow . Scharf looked up from his camera and regarded his subject without a flicker of recognition . If there was anything shocking about Martin Duboff 's appearance , Scharf 's reaction was no ba-  | rometer , unless the momentary tightening of the muscles around his mouth signified anything . " How do you do ? " he said . " Sit here , please . Sideways . " Ferguson sat down and faced the camera . Scharf held the camera cable in his left hand and a photo floodlight in his right . " Please lift the head . Now look a bit to your right . A little more . So ... " He turned on the light and snapped the picture . " Now look at the camera . Tilt the head to your left . A little smile , yes ? Good . " He took six pictures in all . While putting his equipment away , he spoke half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be at the studio in twenty minutes , if the traffic gets no worse . Forty minutes to develop , enlarge and print ? Perhaps . Half an hour for the passport . Another twenty , twenty-five minutes back here , yes ? Altogether , that 's one hour , fifty minutes . To be safe , we will say two hours . " He turned to Knight . " If you will give me the passport now , I will be back in two hours . If I am not , you will know I am dead . " Another fold , presumably a smile , creased his face . " A pleasure meeting you , Mr. Duboff . I will see you soon with the " ? he groped for the word ? " merchandise . " Knight reached into his desk and handed a blank American passport to Scharf . " You will find all pertinent information on Mr. Duboff on that sheet of paper inside the passport . I look forward to your usual excellent work , Hartmut . " Scharf nodded and closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could still be clearly heard through it . " For a minute there , " said Ferguson with relief , " I thought my face would melt under that light . " " I 'd say you passed with flying colors . " The Irishman smiled . " Maybe next week I can do The Student Prince . Now what ? " " We wait . " " A dreadful activity , " Ferguson observed , " especially with a parched tongue . " He cocked a shaggy eyebrow at Knight from his seat on the couch . " What 's your pleasure ? " Knight walked into the kitchen . " The first bottle you touch . " " Ever the connoisseur , eh , Mr. Ferguson ? " Knight returned with a half bottle of Canadian Club and a water glass .  | The Irishman poured himself a third of a tumbler of whisky and slowly rotated it clockwise , gazing into the miniature amber whirlpool he set in motion . " Do you think we 'll get away with it , Jim ? " " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm happy to help , you know that , but I ca n't say I 'm overwhelmed with confidence . I 'm no actor . " It would never do to have Ferguson go nervous on him . " You 'll do fine , " he said . " Look  --  this gambit is based on two very sound psychological principles . The first is that most people are trained not to stare at anyone who is noticeably different from them . Did you see how Hartmut reacted ? He barely glanced at you . Besides , you look rather fierce , you know . Nobody 's going to risk offending you . " " And second ? " " Second , we all see what we expect to see . Once you get visually accustomed to something , fewer details are required to summon up the entire image in your brain the second , third or fourth time . Some psychologists once showed a bunch of kids a photograph of a white rabbit and told them what the fluffy white animal with the two long ears was called . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white animal , one without large ears  --  a guinea pig , in fact  --  and they called that a rabbit , too . Over a period of time , those kids were shown a whole series of pictures , each of an animal a bit further removed from a rabbit . Some went so far as to identify the final picture , which was merely a photograph of a large ball of cotton , as a rabbit , too . " " But we 're not dealing with kids . " " The principle is sound , nevertheless . Ever proofread a letter of yours and miss the fact that Marianne had dropped a word or even an entire line ? " " Yeah . " " You did n't notice the error because you expected to see the missing words . Your brain simply filled them in . I 'm banking on the fact that any discrepancies between the Martin Duboff who enters Vienna and the Martin Duboff who leaves will be similarly filled in by the brains that take notice of him . " " You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your health . " Ferguson raised his glass . " And long life to Martin Duboff , " he added , lifting the whisky to his lips . 59  | " Attaboy . " There was a long silence while each man consulted his own thoughts . Ferguson chuckled . " What is it ? " Knight asked . " I was just thinking , here we are , two orphans of the storm , about to enter romantic Vienna on an international escapade . Oh , if the boys at the Harvard Business School could see me now ! " He set his drink down and crossed his legs . " To think I could have been the controller of some Fortune 500 corporation by now . " " You 'd be bored to death . " " Of course I would . But I 'd be wearing my own face . " He stroked his beard gingerly . " You know , I 'm beginning to get used to this . Might try raising my own one of these days . What about yourself ? " " Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What would you be doing if GVC had n't come along ? " " Probably shuffling papers in the FBI . " " You ? A paper pusher ? " Ferguson guffawed . " I can see you now , practicing that diabolical art of yours with the butter knives in the Bureau cafeteria . " He grew serious . " It 's funny , though , the twists and turns that decide your life . Take me . Looking back , I can say that attending a New Year 's Eve party changed the course of my life . " " How 's that ? " " If Rose and I had n't gone to that bloody party in 1973 , she never would have met Mr. Edward Grimm and fallen hopelessly in love ; we 'd probably be raising a crop of children in an ivy-covered split-level somewhere today . But we went , and she dad , and we are n't . What about you , Jim ? What was the turning point ? " Knight rubbed his chin with a thumb . " No contest  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember , I was only twelve when their plane went down and there were no relatives to turn to . If it had n't been for Gregory ... " " Ah , yes  --  your Greek guru . " " Sort of . " Knight stared off into space . " Gregory Stavrakis ... Gregory the Great , The World 's Most Accurate Knife Thrower ' ; that 's the way he billed himself . When my folks  | died , he took me under his wing . Taught me knives , protected my interest in the circus , saw to it that I got a fair price for my share when we sold out , insisted that I go to college . He even encouraged me to fool around with makeup . Nothing you ever learn is wasted , ' lie used to say . If he only knew ... A good man ; I owe him a lot . " " What became of him ? " " He runs a diner somewhere in northern New Jersey . We still correspond and , when I can , I visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years we 've worked together , that 's the most you 've ever told me about him ? " Knight looked surprised . " Is it ? " " Well , I 'll drink to Mr. Edward Grimm and Gregory the Great ; they made us what we are today . " Ferguson drained his glass . True to his word , shortly before 2:00 P.M. Hartmut Scharf puffed his way into James Knight 's apartment with a U.S. passport , issued by the New York City office of the Department of State , made out in the name of Martin Duboff . In accordance with the information provided by Knight , Duboff was described on the passport as having been born on February 8 , 1918 , in the state of New York ; he had gray hair and brown eyes and stood five feet , nine inches tall . The date of issue was May 28 , 1978 ; the date of expiration , May 27 , 1983 . Affixed to the passport was a photograph that , although presumably the best of the lot , depicted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recent visits by Duboff to France , Spain and the Federal Republic of Germany . " If you will sign your name here " ? Scharf pointed with a pudgy finger to a signature line ? " and again along the left-hand side of the photograph " ? he indicated where ? " it will only remain to emboss it with the seal of your State Department . " While Ferguson carefully wrote his new name twice , Scharf opened a paper bag from which he took out a small seal embosser . He blew on the signatures for a moment , then slipped the page with the photograph between two circular metal plates and pressed down on a black handle . When he was through , Duboff 's photograph and signature bore the seal of the Department of State of the United States of America . Scharf handed the passport to Knight for his inspection .  | After examining it thoroughly , Knight delivered his verdict : " Beautiful . " He took a packet of bills from his breast pocket and handed them to Scharf . Scharf pocketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Knight . I took the liberty of destroying the other photographs and all the negatives . " He slipped the seal embosser into the bag " It is a beautiful job , if I must say so myself . But having a genuine passport to work with makes it a pleasure . " He hesitated for a moment . " What is it , Hartmut ? " " I was going to say that I wish I knew what line of work you were in  --  new US passports are difficult to come by  --  but on second thought I really do n't want to know . In a world of knaves , it is enough to know that one is dealing with a gentleman . " " You 're right . " " Well , " Scharf said to Ferguson , " it only remains to wish you a good journey . " He shook hands solemnly with Ferguson , who grunted his thanks , and then with Knight . Tucking the bag under his arm like a purse , he headed for the door . With one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some concern , " And a successful one . Auf Wiedersehen . " When he had gone , Ferguson exhaled deeply . " I 'd like to drink to that , too , but I 'd better not . " " Relax , Fergy , " said Knight . " Vienna 's going to be a piece of cake . Let 's go . We can grab some lunch at the airport . " But even as they picked up their bags , one nagging question clawed at Knight , a question he was glad Ferguson had not raised . How was he going to pry Beshlenkov loose from the KGB ?  | A mound of shaving cream in his right hand , Al Horowitz , out of the Grand Concourse by way of Brownsville , formerly of the Nassau County ( N.Y. ) Police Department and now an eight-year veteran of the Utah State Police , contemplated his grizzled face and hairy chest in the bathroom mirror with disapproval . Could those jowls and that Buddha body really belong to the City College of New York 's former ace singles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he slapped the shaving cream down his cheeks , slashed it across his upper lip with two fingers , then worked it along the neck and jaw . No two ways about it  --  he would have to diet and get some sort of regular exercise . Too bad the high school did n't have a handball court . But what would Saints possibly know of handball , which was basically a Jewish game , the way polo was fundamentally Gentile ? For that matter , what could they know about any of the finer things of eastern life , like bagels or bialys or blintzes ? Sounded like a hit song . " And here it is , ladies and gentlemen , still working its way up the charts ... Al Horowitz singing Bagels , Bialys and Blintzes . ' Take it , Al .... " Under the needle shower now , he closed his eyes , allowing the water to sculpt his hair against his head . He sought refuge from the spray in a corner of the stall and lazily lathered his barrel body , then walked defiantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gazed out the bathroom window toward the distant mountains , purpling in the dusk . It had been those mountains , among other considerations  --  the space , the Creation-fresh air , the slower pace  --  that had seduced him and Muriel to forsake the flatlands of Long Island and obey Horace Greeley . They had never regretted it . With his impressive service record , including several commendations , it had not been difficult to land a job with the Utah State Police . They liked their neighbors and the community ; their son , Mark , a popular kid , was on the high school swimming team ; and they found the Saints to be up- 1 : , ' d  | standing , decent people . Horowitz could not even recall the last time he had had to unholster his revolver in the line of duty . He stepped on the scale softly , convinced that in some magical way it would therefore register less . He was mistaken ; the dial spun to 207 , then dropped to 196 , zeroed in at 201 . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no more noshes until he was down to 175 . Except Sunday mornings , maybe . Make that definitely . How would a man know it was Sunday if there were n't a stack of wheat cakes with butter bubbling on it like lava and thick maple syrup puddling the plate ? Since the decision to diet was a positive step , Al Horowitz dressed with a complacent sense of having triumphed over his flesh . " The truth , " he said twenty minutes later to Muriel , who was reading a magazine at the kitchen table . " If you did n't know me , how old would you say I was ? " He sucked in his gut as he turned around . Muriel Horowitz , an attractive brunette with a dimple-framed mouth , removed her glasses , laid down the magazine and squintingly assessed her husband in his dark blue suit . " Forty-eight , " she said . " Aww , come on . The truth . " " The truth ? " He nodded vigorously . " Sixty-seven. " " ? h , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth ? Here 's my final offer . If I was walking down the street and I saw this good-looking chubby guy coming toward me , you know what I 'd think ? " " What ? " " I 'd think , hey Muriel Horowitz , look ! Here comes your husband , Al . He 's forty-eight years old . " Horowitz laughed . " Smart ass , " he said . " I married a Brooklyn smart ass . " He stood behind her chair and leaned over it , cupping her breasts . " And I married a fresh guy from the Bronx , " she said , making no move to discourage him . " So what the hell are we doing in Mormon land ? " " You like it here , do n't you ? " He was suddenly serious .  | " Whither thou goest , Horowitz ... You know that . " Concerned that her flippancy might have hurt him , she reached up to pat his face . " I love it , Al . And you . " He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come ? Just about everybody will be there . " " I really do n't feel up to it . I 'm always tired by Friday night . You go ahead . " " You sure ? " " Really . " " Okay . " He stood up . " Where 's Mark ? " " Fiddling with his car , what else ? He 's adding some doodads to i that CB unit of his . " " Who ever heard of a Jewish ham ? " " That 's quite a boy we have . " ; " One of your better performances . " " I know . " " Well , " he said , rising . " Who 's being honored ? " " Let 's see . " Horowitz rubbed his brow . " There 's Dora Evans ... Miles Trumbull ... I think Frank Durst. .. a couple of others . " " Durst ? " She opened her eyes wide . " Whatever for ? " " What do you honor pharmacists for ? Maybe for not poisoning ' anyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like him . " " Why ? ? " I do n't know . I 'm probably being unfair , but there 's something about the way he looks at you without looking at you .... " " What do you mean , looks at you without looking at you ' ? " I " I ca n't explain it . But I know what I mean . " I Horowitz shook his head . I " Never mind . Go and have a good time . " E He kissed her . " See you later , Babe . " He was almost out the door when she called his name . " What ? " he asked . " Not a day over thirty-nine , " she said , blowing him a kiss . ? The Ramada Inn , located six miles outside of Dalton , Utah , in the northwest corner of the state , lies nestled against the Grouse  | Creek Mountains , just north of the Great Salt Lake Desert . Perched high above the winding road leading to town , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the central feature of which is an enormous fireplace occupying one entire wall . A wide curving staircase to the left of the desk leads to the rooms on the second floor . The ground floor accommodates a small coffee shop , a restaurant , and three banquet rooms that can be turned into one large hall by opening the sliding doors that subdivide it . They were open this Friday evening , April 1 , for the Dalton Chamber of Commerce meeting that began at eight o'clock . The Chamber 's meetings seldom attracted more than twenty-five or thirty businessmen at any one time , but this was an extraordinary gathering , dedicated to recognizing those local citizens who had distinguished themselves in some civic way during the past year . Horowitz coaxed his car up the steep dirt road that corkscrewed its way to the motel . There was no guardrail and someday , he thought , something unpleasant was going to happen there . By the time he arrived , all the parking spaces were occupied and automobiles lined both sides of the driveway . He pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path to the motel , sorry that Muriel was not with him . She was a good conversationalist , quick witted and poised ; people instinctively liked her . He found it difficult to make the kind of small talk occasions like this required . But he was a member of the community and felt it incumbent upon himself to attend . A good cop made it his business to know the people he served and Al Horowitz was a good cop . When he opened the door , the lobby was packed with men and women divided into small gossiping knots , exchanging the easy banter that living together in a small town encourages . It was , Horowitz thought , like being suddenly transported to the New York City of twenty years ago . The men wore their hair short and were clean shaven ; the women dressed modestly , with only the barest suggestion of makeup . A hell of a good little town , Dalton . " Hey , Al ! How 's my favorite Gentile ? " George Stringfellow , a large , ruddy-complexioned man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George , " he said , nodding to the others . " How 's the farm equipment business ? "  | " No complaints , my friend . Where 's Muriel ? " " Home . She was feeling a little under the weather . " " Aw , too bad . Give her my best , will you ? " " Sure thing . " " What do you think , Al ? " another man asked . " We were just talking about how Dalton seems to be stagnating . I do n't think we 've gained more than a dozen new residents in the last five years . What can we do to attract some new blood here ? " " Gee , I do n't know , Chris . I 'm not sure a town like Dalton has to grow . " ? L " That 's because you 're not a businessman . The fewer people , the less crime , right ? " Il " It 's not that , although what you say is true . But some towns reach a point where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have a car dealer , three gas stations , two department stores , a hardware store , a drugstore and so on . Everything 's in balance . " He looked around quizzically to see whether he had lil made his point . " With all due respect , Al , " a redheaded newcomer to the group w said , " that 's a lot of baloney . " " If it is n't Mr. Miles Trumbull , " Stringfellow said in mock awe , " one of our honored guests . " Trumbull clicked his heels and bowed . " In person . But getting back to what you were saying , Al , I would n't mind seeing some R new faces around here , I can tell you . When I bought the dairy back in seventy-four , it was doing fine . But with inflation and all , I do n't know what would have happened if we had n't expanded from a three-town dairy into the countywide business we have today . In business , you need volume . " " I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When people think of Utah , all they know is Salt Lake City and Ogden or maybe Provo . What we need is some publicity . " " Granted , " said Stringfellow 's wife , a tall brunette . " But what do we have to publicize ? " " A beautiful town that 's clean and safe and enjoys a budget surplus , that 's what . " " That 's not enough today , Dave , " Trumbull said . " You have to be in good skiing country or have a Disney complex nearby or at least a state park to attract people . How can we compete with the 67  | Wasatch Mountains or the parks in the southern part of the state ? " " I 'm not talking about tourists ; I 'm talking about people who want to settle down in the west . " " Then you have even bigger problems . You 're bucking Arizona , California and the whole Pacific Northwest . " " I still say that Dalton ? " A bell rang , cutting off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a voice on the PA system announced . " Let 's go , " Horowitz said , glad to be through with a discussion that appeared to be going nowhere . After the routine business was disposed of , Elliot Chasen , president of the Dalton Chamber of Commerce , rose and approached the podium . " I guess it 's no secret why we 're here tonight , " he said into the microphone . " As you all know , it has been the Chamber 's annual custom to honor those residents of our town who have , in some way , made Dalton a better place to live . We 're very fortunate this year to have five such outstanding citizens . Will each of you rise as I name you and join me up here ? " He looked around the room as if to verify that his instructions were understood . " Our first honored guest is a lady ... and , as anyone on the Town Council can tell you , what a lady ! Two years ago , she had a dream for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to say the least , ambitious . Next month , that park is going to be dedicated  --  twelve acres of verdant countryside , with two tennis courts , a playground , a formal garden and walking paths . I give you a truly great citizen of Dalton  --  and a terrific gal  --  Dora Evans ! Dora , come up , will you ? " A stout woman in a black and white dress stood and excused herself past a row of people . Walking slowly , she nodded regally to admirers on either side of the aisle who were whispering their congratulations to her . " I can see that that was a popular choice , " Chasen said , turning again to the microphone . " We come to the menfolk now . The first gentleman is a man who has proven his devotion not only to the people of this community , but to his own high calling . I suppose he 's seen more of us in our pajamas  --  or less  --  than anyone in Dalton . " There was friendly laughter and scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave . Chasen held his  | hands up for quiet . " By now , you must realize I 'm talking about none other than our own great Dr. Samuel Glover . Dr. Glover , will you please come up ? " A man in his mid-fifties with a soft cloud of white hair rose from the audience and made his way to an aisle as enthusiastic applause greeted him . He walked rapidly , smiling all the way , and clasped Chasen 's extended hand in both his own when he reached the podium . The audience rose in tribute . Dr. Glover waved and smiled , graciously accepting the applause . When the room had quieted , Chasen resumed . " The third citizen of Dalton we honor this year has become synonymous with charity . There is n't a worthwhile cause you can name that he has n't been prominently associated with . He has given generously of his time , energy and resources to the Boy Scouts , the Red Cross , the 4-H Club and the Heart Fund , among others . Last winter , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rotary 's annual charity drive . " Again , as the audience recognized the recipient of the award , the applause began to build . Chasen signaled for a moment more of time . " Appropriately enough , considering his line of business , he is a walking advertisement for the milk of human kindness . Who else could I be talking about but Miles Trumbull ? " Trumbull , a large , athletic man , rose from his seat and bounded up the aisle to stand next to Dora Evans and take the crowd 's applause as he shook Elliot Chasen 's hand . His hair shone like a flame under the lights as he exchanged congratulations with the others . " Our fourth honored guest is probably better known to your sons and daughters than to you because his work brings him into contact with our young people every day . But he 's never been content to do only what he 's paid to do . Oh , no . From the moment he moved to Dalton , he has devoted himself to keeping our kids so involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into mischief . Well , not much , anyway . " Chasen led the audience in an appreciative chuckle . " He organized the Keep Our City Clean ' Junior Council , breathed new life into the high school ski club and , on his own time and initiative , has badgered every businessman in town into giving our youngsters on-the-job experience in the workaday world . I have it on no less authority than my own 69  | daughter , Linda , that he is also one heck of a biology teacher . Carl Barnes , will you step up here ? " A short man in his thirties , powerfully built , rose from a front seat , turned to the applauding audience with a grin , and joined the others behind Chasen . " Now we come to our final recipient of the year  --  a man whose dedication to the community is well known to all of you . Thanks to his initiative and perseverance , the library expansion program was a tremendous success . 1 still do n't know how he managed to convince the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he did and I think that 's great . Besides , he makes the best darn , ice cream sodas in Box Elder County . I 'm talking about everybody 's favorite druggist , Frank Durst . Come on up here , Frank , and get what 's coming to you . " Durst rose in the middle of the hall and made his way solemnly to the front . As all five good citizens of Dalton stood side by side , the audience signaled its approval of the choices with sustained applause . Gloria Bradstreet , staff photographer of the Dalton Banner , fluttered about the room with her Polaroid , snapping pictures from every conceivable angle . Chasen awarded a scroll to each , then returned to the microphone . " Refreshments will now be served in the lobby , where you can talk to our celebrities . This meeting of the Dalton Chamber of Commerce is hereby adjourned . The next regular meeting will be held on May second . Thank you all for coming and good evening . " The crowd filed out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cookies and cake had been set up . Al Horowitz , anxious to be with Muriel , wondered how soon he could leave without appearing rude . On line at one of the tables , he decided to have just one cup of punch before breaking away . No cake , no cookies . Absolutely not . He would sip the punch slowly , then out . Around him people were resuming conversations that had been interrupted by the meeting . Some discussed the appropriateness of the awards , others the spirit of the town and its people . Dr. Glover strolled by Horowitz 's line , pausing to accept additional kudos with his characteristic modesty . " See , Doc , " a man said , " it pays to make house calls . "  | The doctor chuckled . " You 're right , Dave . But now that I 'm a big shot , I may have to raise my fees . " He patted Horowitz on the back . " Hello , Al . How 's it going ? " " Fine , Doc . Congratulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this certificate " ? he waved the rolled paper in his hand ? " and hang it in the office , right next to my diplomas . I really feel like a Dalton old-timer now . " Horowitz , who had advanced to the head of the line , was handed a paper cup of punch by a smiling gray-haired lady and moved out of the way with Glover . " Funny you should say that , " he replied . J ! , " I was thinking the same thing today . I 've only spent about onesixth of my life here , but in a way I feel as though I 've always lived in Dalton . " " I know what you mean . " " Hey , Doc ... Frank  --  come over here a minute ! " It was Miles Trumbull across the lobby , with Dora Evans and Carl Barnes . " Gloria wants a shot of all of us together . " Dr. Glover shrugged his shoulders at Horowitz . " The price of fame . Excuse me , Al . " " Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Durst , who had been standing alone in front of the fireplace , brushed by Horowitz when he heard his name called . For a moment , they looked into each other 's eyes and exchanged mumbled greetings . It was only a moment , but suddenly Horowitz realized the truth of what Muriel had said . Durst 's eyes were the color of smoke , cold , expressionless , almost reptilian . He had looked into eyes like that once before . They belonged to a teenager he had chased after a liquor store holdup years ago . Morowitz had almost collared him when he tripped and fell . The boy had pounced on him like a cougar and calmly aimed a .38 at his forehead . They had stared solemnly at each other for a fraction of a second before the kid pulled the trigger , misfired , then pulled the trigger a second time .. . and misfired again . Horowitz had grabbed his leg , thrown him to the ground and almost twisted his arms out of their sockets before cuffing him . Later , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with relief . He had never mentioned it to Muriel , but for weeks afterward he had dreamed of those iron-calm , remorseless eyes .  | After the reception , the four of them gathered in Durst 's hilltop house outside Dalton . " Well , " Carl Barnes said triumphantly , holding up his scroll like a baton , " we did it ! Christ , a clean sweep ! Even they could n't ask for more . " Dr. Glover nodded . " I have to agree with our young friend here . They can never accuse us of stinting in our efforts to be accepted by the community . " He watched Durst closely to see whether he was pleased . As ever , Durst remained noncommittal . " True , we 've accomplished phase one of our mission , but let 's remember that , while very necessary , it is only phase one . The success of Crucible hinges on phase two and our lives depend on phase three . " Trumbull shifted uneasily in his chair . " Why the hell ca n't you relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , we 've just pulled a real coup  --  on schedule , I might add  --  and all you can do is moan and groan about phase two and phase three . Relax . Things could n't be going better . " Durst calmly shifted his eyes to Trumbull . " Let me remind you of two things , " he said in an even voice . " One , I am in charge of Operation Crucible . And two , there is no such thing as relaxing on this mission . We are being tested every minute of every day and we must play our parts to the hilt . Do you have any conception of what 's at stake here ? This is n't a game we 're involved in ; we 're talking about wiping out a civilization . " He paused to let the enormity of it sink in . " An entire civilization . " Trumbull fell silent . He did n't like to think about that part , preferring to concentrate on the money and the life it would make possible . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have weeks to go and it does nothing for morale or the success of our mission to squabble among ourselves . Under the circumstances , may I suggest we take each day at a time ? " I agree , " said Durst . " Now , where do you stand , Carl ? " Barnes leaned forward eagerly in his chair . " The first shipment of Zeta arrived eighteen weeks ago ; the most recent , the day before yesterday . I do n't think I can safely receive more than four liters at a time and no more frequently than every other week without arousing suspicion . It would be different if I were the only 72  | biology teacher , but the Anderson woman has to be considered , and she 's bright . Unfortunately , Zeta ca n't remain unrefrigerated for more than six hours at a time , so I 'm getting cramped for space . I 've been taking some home and keeping it in my fridge . I may ask each of you to do the same . " " Hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have in the dairy 's cold room . It 's the size of the Grand Canyon . " " Absolutely not ! " Durst said . " All we need is for some smart employee to get inquisitive , which is precisely why I 'm not keeping any at the drugstore . " Trumbull discounted the danger with a shake of his head and a wave of a hand . " That 's just the kind of sloppy thinking that can kill Crucible . . . and us , " Durst continued . " Your judgment leaves a lot to be desired , Miles . " Trumbull 's face crimsoned . " And you ? " he began . " Yes ? " Durst regarded him inquisitively . " Nothing . " " Go ahead , Carl . " " That 's about it , except to point out that we should have enough ' Leta on hand to begin phase two in four weeks , on schedule . " " Good , " said Durst , clearly pleased . He turned to Glover . " Doc-tor ? " Glover glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ; he hated dissension . " Working with Miles ' list of customers , " he said , " so far I 've been able to identify four hundred and ten Mormon families of childbearing age that are served by the Great Northern Utah Dairy Company . The women range in age from eighteen to thirty-nine , the men slightly older . I have segregated a special group of twenty-eight couples along the lines I described at our last meeting . Naturally , I intend tp continue adding to both numbers up to the last minute . " " How do you maintain the lists ? " Durst asked . " A simple color code , very discreet . " " And how are things at your end , Miles ? " Still smarting from Durst 's treatment , Trumbull tugged at his collar with a grimace . " No problem , " he said , " but the timing has to be right . From a security angle , we should add Zeta on a Sunday morning . The closest we come to shutting down is on Saturday af-73 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty early Sunday . That 's our chance . But one man ca n't do it alone . I 'll need help . " . He looked at Barnes , who nodded agreement . " So that 's it , " he concluded . " I 'm ready to roll as soon as I get the word . " Frank Durst fell silent for a time , as if he were rerunning something in his mind . The others knew better than to break his concentration . Say what they would , Durst was a brilliant organizer and tactician , gifted with an infinite patience for details . He was also completely ruthless . As some men are born tone-deaf or colorblind , so he had come into the world , hyenalike , entirely bereft of any moral sense . When he finally spoke , it was to tell the others that the meeting was over . " I 'll be in touch , " he said . " Meanwhile , from this point on , I think it would be judicious if none of us left town ... for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who crimsoned and stared at the floor . " You will continue to make your hospital rounds , Doctor , but that is all . " " What about me , Frank ? " Trumbull said . " The business requires me to tour the county at least once every two weeks . If I suddenly stopped , it would look suspicious as hell . " Durst considered Trumbull 's point , then turned his slate eyes on the dairy owner . " All right . But no more often than that . Do you mind letting yourselves out ? I 'm tired . " He headed for the stairs . Outside the house , Trumbull told the others , " Someday I 'm going to break that bastard 's goddamn neck ! " " Do n't say that , Miles , " Glover said . " We 've got to stick together on this . It 's so incredibly big . " " Shove its size ! Nobody talks to me like that . " The night was as crisp as an autumn apple . As they headed for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pebbles underfoot seemed to be the only sound in the universe . Spread out below them , under a star-flecked sky , were the lights of Dalton , fast blinking out now as midnight approached . Carl Barnes looked down at the town before sliding into his car and shook his head in awe . Biggest damn laboratory in the world , he thought .  | " Good evening , sir . May I help you ? " Uncanny , Knight thought , how European desk clerks could always divine the native tongue of a guest . " I have a reservation , " he said . " James Knight . With a K. " " Certainly , Mr. Knight . One moment , please . " The clerk left the desk to consult a revolving rack of cards . " How am I doing ? " Ferguson asked in a low voice . " Fine . Just remember to walk like an older man . " " I do n't mind telling you , I feel damn conspicuous . " " That 's exactly what you 're supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Holding two registration cards in his hand , the clerk was looking at Knight with precisely the right mixture of deference and inquisitiveness . " That 's right . " " You have room five twenty-nine , facing the park , a beautiful view . " He offered the cards across the desk . " I 'm afraid it wo n't do . " Knight said . The clerk looked injured . " I can assure you it is a splendid room , " he said defensively . " I 'm sure it is . But I 'm a poor sleeper and street noises disturb me . Something higher , above the tenth floor , or in the back , perhaps ? " He pushed the cards back to the clerk . " Let me see what I can do . " When he was gone . Ferguson whispered , " You sleep like a corpse . What 's up ? " " Bugs , Fergy , bugs . Room five twenty-nine could have been turned into a broadcasting studio since we made our reservations . " The clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-seven , with the same lovely view , is available . " He produced two new cards for their signatures . " Thank you , " he said , examining Ferguson 's card . " And you are Mr. Duboff , of course . Welcome , gentlemen , to the Hotel Wien . Enjoy your stay . "  | " I 'm sure we will , " Knight replied , adding as a casual afterthought , " The hotel seems very crowded . Some sort of conven-tion ? " " Several , sir . Urban planners ... bankers ... biologists ? " " Biologists ? " " Yes , indeed . They 'll be coming in from all over the world , nearly six hundred of them . " How long will they be here ? " " From Sunday night to Friday next . " " What do you suppose biologists talk about to each other ? " " I ca n't imagine . You would think that a germ is a germ , would n't you ? " The clerk demonstrated his personality with a quick smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could attend any of the sessions ? " " I could not say . But you might check with the hospitality desk . " He pointed to a far corner of the lobby where an empty chair stood behind an unadorned wooden table . " Somebody will be there tomorrow . You might make inquiries . " " I 'll do that , " Knight said . He and Ferguson followed a bellboy into an elevator . In a leather wing chair , not far from the International Biology Association 's hospitality desk , a pair of slender hands slowly closed the Friday edition of the Arbeiter Zeitung , folded it neatly and placed it on a side table . A young man , dressed very correctly for the evening , stood up . He was tall . Thin . And as he made his way through the crowded lobby , he moved like a panther among trees . Ferguson fell back heavily on one of the beds , clasped his hands behind his head and stared at the ceiling . " You know what I think ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of fags . " " Ridiculous , " Knight replied . " But be careful on that bed , " he added with a straight face , " and do n't smear your makeup . " " Very funny . " Knight shook out a suit and hung it in the closet . " As a matter of  | fact , " he said over his shoulder , " I 'd better check you out before dinner and repair any damage . It would n't do to have your beard fall into the soup . " Ferguson peeled off his gloves . " Can I take this damn thing out of my nose now ? " " Go ahead . I brought some spares . " " Ahhh ... " Ferguson massaged the outside of the violated nostril with a knuckle . " I hope GVC appreciates what I 'm going through . " " Your valor will be duly recorded . I can see it now .... He gave his nose for his country . " Knight heaved his suitcase onto the other bed ; from it he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target and placed them in a bottom drawer of one of the two dressers , carefully covering them with shirts . Next he lifted out a cardboard box that served as his makeup kit and placed it on the dresser . " You ca n't eat with your gloves on , so I 'm going to have to age your hands before we go down to dinner . " Ferguson sat up on the edge of his bed and examined the backs of his hands . " Why ca n't we eat in the room ? " he asked . " Because Martin Duboff has to be seen and recognized and accepted as part of the scenery . Sorry , Fergy . That 's the way it has to be . " Okay . " There was resignation in his voice . " What else is on the agenda ? " " I 'm going to acquaint myself with the hotel . You 're going to circulate in the lobby . " Ferguson cocked his head to one side . " Surely it 's occurred to you that getting the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What do you mean ? " " You know what I mean . How long did it take you to make me up in the security of your own apartment ? Forty-five minutes ? An hour ? Fine . But before you can sit Beshlenkov down in this room and start shoving large foreign objects up his nose , you 're going to have to get him away from his bodyguard and up here unnoticed . Then you have to duplicate this face " ? Ferguson pointed at his own ? " without any interruptions . " " So ? " " So how the hell are you going to do that ? "  | " I 'm not sure ... yet . That 's why I want to case the hotel . I have to find out where the delegates to the convention will be spending most of their time and see how I can , one , contact Beshlenkov , and two , get him up here fast . I 'll find a way , Fergy . There 's always a way . Which reminds me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dialed an outside line , followed by the number Harcourt had given him . It rang four times . Then a female voice , as soft and warm as fur and with only the slightest suggestion of an accent , answered with " Hallo . " Feeling foolish  --  passwords and phrases always struck him as juvenile  --  Knight said , " I hope I have the right number . " A pause . " How may we help you ? " " Just checking . You do offer around-the-clock service ? " " There will always be somebody here to answer the telephone . " " And can I rely on you to get me whatever I need ? " " We 'll certainly try . " " You 're a comfort . " " Is that all ? " " For now , yes . " " Very good . " There was a click at the other end of the line . " What was that all about ? " Ferguson asked . Knight winked . We are not alone , Mr. Duboff . A vast underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , is at our beck and call . " " Why do n't we call her back and beck her right now ? " Ferguson waggled his shaggy eyebrows . " I 'm not all that hungry . " " None of that , you shameless Hibernian incubus . " Knight opened the makeup box . " Let 's take care of your hands , " he said , pointing to a chair in front of the desk , " and freshen up that pretty face . " They went their separate ways after dinner , Ferguson to the lobby under strict instructions to be conspicuous for two hours , Knight to acquaint himself with the anatomy of the hotel . He began with his own floor , the twelfth . The Hotel Wien was not inspired architecture , he discovered ; it was simply a large box  | housing some eleven hundred rooms . Scattered about the corridors were linen closets , small rooms containing the entrails of the telephone and electrical systems , and periodic spaces little larger than upright coffins which accommodated pails , mops and sinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the building , the other on the south , served as fire exits . Knight assumed that the top floor  --  the twenty-fourth  --  contained larger suites . He would check that out later . More to the point now was locating the banquet hall . If , as the clerk had said , the International Biology Association was holding the largest convention , it would be using the largest room , at least for its initial meeting . He took an elevator to the lobby and found the directory . His eyes scanned the white block letters pressed on black felt until he found what he was looking for under SUNDAY , 3 APRIL . It said , INTNTL BIOLOGY ASSN-RECEPTION &; DINNER GRAND BALLROOM 9 P.M. A bellboy as immaculate as a freshly made bed pointed to the staircase leading to the Grand Ballroom on the second floor . On his way there , Knight caught sight of Ferguson Ili , shambling about with a newspaper tucked under an arm , followed by a small boy who was authentically mimicking his gait . The entrance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumble through and the room itself was mammoth . Bare round tables nudged each other and one wall was almost hidden by stacked chairs . Three chandeliers hung from the ceiling like up-side-down Christmas trees . On one side of the room were two sets of doors leading to a kitchen . It would take a battalion of waiters to serve a meal to the twelve or fifteen hundred people who could fit comfortably into the Grand Ballroom . It would not be difficult to get lost in such an arena ; it therefore presented possibilities . Knight returned to the lobby  --  Ferguson was nowhere in sight  --  and sauntered outside . The Hotel Wien was located at Johannesgasse 32 , just across the street from the Stadtpark . One side of it ran along Kantgasse ; the other faced the side of another , smaller hotel ; only an alley separated the two . Deliveries were apparently made in the rear . Johannesgasse was a main artery , well lit , wide but subject to traffic jams , especially in the evening . With just a little luck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hospitality desk in the morning .  | There was little more he could do tonight ; he looked at his watch : 9:22 . Ferguson would not be returning to the room before ten ; that left enough time for an undisturbed practice session , then a hot bath and bed . He headed back to the hotel . In the lobby he almost collided with Ferguson , still hotly pursued by the little boy . " The little bastard 's sticking like flypaper , " he managed out of a corner of his mouth before spinning through the revolving doors into the street . The boy remained inside the lobby , but solemnly watched Ferguson melt into the crowd . Smiling , Knight entered an elevator and pressed the 12 button . The elevator was large , deep and richly carpeted , with waist-high brass handrails running around three sides . Above the rails were mirrors ; below them , dark mahogany wood . It moved soundlessly , stopping at his floor with no sense of motion . Stepping into the corridor , Knight dug into his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing passed by . He opened the door to room 1227 and groped for the light switch . A split second too late , he sensed that he was not alone . A voice cut through the darkness . " Good evening , Rainbow , " it said . 80  | " Put your arms down .. . very slowly , please .. . and do not move , " the voice continued . As he did so , Knight tried to determine from the voice where the body it belonged to might be standing , but he was not familiar enough with the room to be accurate . " I 've been looking forward to this for a long time , " the voice continued . " What did you call me ? " Knight asked . " Rainbow . " " A colorful name , but I think you 've confused me with someone else . " " I do n't think so . " The voice was calm , unhurried , sure of itself . Knight turned his head slightly in an effort to locate the speaker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dark ; yours are not . " " I feel foolish , standing here like this . " " Better that you feel foolish for a moment more than we hurt each other needlessly . " There was no menace in the voice ; it was almost deferential . " Who are you ? " " A friend . " " Then let me turn on the light . " " In a moment . Before you do , I want you to understand and believe that I am your friend . " " I believe you . Now can I turn on the light ? " The voice ignored his request . " We have a mutual acquaintance . " " Who would that be ? " " Clarence Harcourt . " " Who ? " " Clarence Harcourt . " " Why do n't you just tell me your name ? " " Call me Pedestrian . " Knight 's eyes narrowed . Damn the darkness . " Strange name . " Play for time . 81  | " I do strange work . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be able to see . Keep him talking . " The same as you , but in the north  --  the Benelux countries and the United Kingdom . " " And what work is that ? " " Whatever is necessary , Rainbow , as you know . Please turn on the light now . Just remember , I 'm a friend . " Knight flicked the switch and saw the man who called himself Pedestrian . He was a good five inches taller than Knight , reed-thin , with dark hair combed straight back and high pronouhced cheekbones across which the skin was drawn so tautly that it seemed to shine . Although he was standing on the far side of the room , he reached Knight in a few steps and extended his hand . Knight was relieved to see that he was unarmed , but ignored the hand . " I 'm here to help with Beshlenkov , " he said , lowering his arm in disappointment . " But you 'll want to check me out with Harcourt , of course . Please do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join you here . The Russian must be a very big fish . " Knight said nothing . He was already dialing the telephone . While he waited for the connection , he kept his eyes on the tall man " Know who this is ? " he asked someone at the other end . " I 'm interrupting an important meeting ? Good . I have a couple of questions . What ? That 's the first one ... okay . Describe him . " Knight scanned Pedestrian 's face as he listened . " Yes , he certainly is .. . oh ? Where ? " Pedestrian was already removing his jacket and rolling up the right sleeve of his shirt . On his forearm was a tattoo of a bird in flight . Knight gripped Pedestrian 's arm tightly while he examined the tattoo . When he finally let go , the younger man massaged the flesh that bore Knight 's finger marks . " Anything else ? " Knight listened for a moment , then cupped his hand over the speaker and looked at Pedestrian . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " I joined GVC on August eleventh , three years ago . " " Let 's see your ID card . " 82  | The tall man shook his head . " We are n't issued any . " " Where 's the primary northern sector drop ? " " A chemist 's shop on Wigmore Street , London . " " The code for a completed mission ? " " Warmest regards . ' " Speaking into the telephone again , Knight said , " My other question is , did n't I make it clear that I prefer to work alone ? ... Yes , I have a plan , " he lied . " None of your business . " He slammed down the receiver . " Do I pass ? " Pedestrian asked , collapsing into a chair like a tent that 's suddenly struck . " You 're so damn young , " Knight said . " Twenty-seven . " " That 's young . " " In our business , we ca n't be old . And you may find my services of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up , extending his arms as if in supplication . " What you see before you is the result of five generations of selec- I tive breeding . My great-great-grandfather , who was French , stoodI six feet tall  --  big for that time  --  and his wife could look him straight in the eye . We have always married tall in my family . More importantly , **25;875;TOOLONG studied under Charlemont . " " Charlemont ? " " The great Joseph Charlemont of Paris , a remarkable teacher whose art all the men in my family have mastered . " " What art ? " I " Perhaps I 'll show you some time . " Knight found himself annoyed by the air of mystery Pedestrian seemed determined to preserve until he remembered how , at that age , he too had taken secret pride in what he did so well . " Whatever you say . " " If I have n't already made it clear , I want you to know I consider it a great honor to be working with the legendary Rainbow . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your exploits . The Nazi engineers in II Egypt ... the rescue of those diplomats in Italy ... the Spanish affair ... those mysterious explosions in Libya . .. brilliant ! " He  | shook his head in wonder . " At the same time , I must apologize for the dramatic way in which I introduced myself . I thought it would be wise to meet you in private and , in view of your reputation , I wanted a minute to explain who I was . " " My reputation ? " " For never missing . I 'm not a small target . " Knight laughed for the first time . " I do n't go around disposing of everyone who talks to me . " " The main reason I 'm twenty-seven , Rainbow , is that I 'm very careful . " " Sound policy . " Pedestrian shrugged . " As you see , it pays off ; I 'm here . But you have never heard of me before this evening ? " There was ill-concealed disappointment in his voice . Knight took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuously for the last few years , " he explained , " and frankly I prefer to know as little as possible about the rest of you . " " I understand . " Pedestrian reached lazily into his jacket and produced a slim silver cigarette case engraved with the same figure of a bird in flight that he wore on his arm . He thumbed it open in front of Knight , who waved it away . " Thanks , I 've given them up . " " You are a superman , " the younger man said , lighting up and drawing deeply on a Gauloise . " I 've tried a hundred times , without success . " He tilted his head back and exhaled toward the ceiling with obvious satisfaction , then leaned forward . " It 's an exciting life , is n't it ? " " It 's seldom dull . " Knight recognized himself in the eager young man before him and suddenly felt the bonds of danger and violence that they shared drawing them closer . " The best part is finally having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes sparkled as he lowered his voice . " I 've always wanted to ask you , how do you handle the killing  --  afterward , I mean ? Have you ever failed ? What was your most difficult assignment ? " He licked his lips in anticipation . " Whoa ! You 've asked enough questions to carry us into the middle of next week . Do n't you think we 'd better concentrate on the matter at hand ? "  | " How stupid ! Forgive me . " Knight sensed his chagrin and made light of it . " Not stupid at all . The killing always bothers you . If it does n't , you 're in trouble . But if you keep the kind of stakes we play for in mind , and use the killing as a last resort , then it 's almost bearable . But deep down , where it counts , it always bothers you ... always . And yes , I 've failed  --  twice . Once when I did n't get to a railroad station in time , once when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never been late for an appointment since , or trusted someone I have n't known for a long time . Present company excluded , I might add . " Pedestrian looked at Knight mischievously . " Of course I do n't believe that part . I can understand caution . But I 'll prove myself , given half a chance . " " You may get more than that on this assignment . " Knight left his chair and rummaged through the bureau drawer containing the Beshlenkov dossier . " Let me run through this with you , " he said , motioning the young man to the divan . Half an hour later , after he had read all the material , Pedestrian exhaled audibly . " Quite a man . But tell me , what 's he got that we want so badly ? " " Ca n't say for sure , but I do n't think we 'd be far off if we assumed it has to do with biological warfare . " " I thought there were international agreements against that ? " Knight arched one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way of getting an edge ? " " What 's your plan ? " " I 'll tell you half of it , because that 's all I 've got so far . " Knight explained what he hoped to do , what he had learned of the hotel , and Ferguson 's role . " The problem is contacting Beshlenkov , getting him away from the KGB and making him up as Martin Duboff . " " Why not simply eliminate the opposition ? Sentimental songs notwithstanding , the Danube is conveniently murky . " " It may come to that , though I 'd prefer it did n't . " " Why ? " " You get one of theirs ; they retaliate by getting one of yours . Where does it end ? " " Good point . I 'm learning from you already . "  | Pedestrian suddenly touched Knight 's knee , at the same time signaling for silence with a finger to his lips . With a toss of his head , he called attention to the twisting doorknob . They rose as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poised for action . A key turned quietly and the door opened . It was Ferguson . He looked up at Pedestrian in surprise , then at Knight . " What is it ? " he asked hoarsely , clearly frightened . Knight shook his head in relief . " You crazy Irishman , why did n't you knock ? " " How am I supposed to know you 're in ? " He pointed at the tall man . " Who 's he ? " " Matt Ferguson , meet Pedestrian , a GVC employee who 'll be working with us . " " My pleasure , " Pedestrian said , shaking hands . " How are you ? " Ferguson said , regaining his composure . " You 're a bloody giraffe , are n't you ? " " And you are incredibly ugly , " Pedestrian said with a smile . " That 's the truth . I caught sight of myself in the elevator mirror just now and thought , poor sonofabitch , it must have been a horrible accident . Then I realized it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll have to take off your makeup , " Knight said , " and give you a fresh face in the morning . " " You 've got yourself a deal . Did you see that little prick following me around the lobby ? " " It suits our purpose , Fergy . A lot of people saw you . " He beckoned Ferguson over to the desk and prepared to remove the makeup . Pedestrian watched with fascination as Martin Duboff slowly turned into Matt Ferguson . " You are fantastic ! " he exclaimed . " I thought you guys were never allowed to meet , " Ferguson said . " What does that tell us about Beshlenkov ? " Knight asked . Ferguson nodded slowly . " I want to spot him as soon as he arrives , so let 's study those photos again and take turns covering the lobby tomorrow . Now go wash your face . " " When do we meet again ? " Pedestrian asked . " We do n't ... not for a while . Study those photographs until you  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sleep . You 'll cover the lobby from ten to noon , then again from four to six in the evening , if necessary . As soon as you see him , call me on a house phone . If he has n't checked in by eight , I 'll visit you in your room . What 's the number ? " " Nine-twelve . " " Be there . Between now and then , I do n't know you . " Pedestrian scanned the photographs for several minutes , closed his eyes , looked at them once more . " I 've got him , " he said at last , returning the pictures to Knight . " Say good night to Mr. Ferguson for me . " " Say it yourself , " Ferguson said , emerging from the bathroom . Pedestrian 's eyes widened in mock disbelief . " What 's the matter ? " Ferguson asked uneasily . " Why ... you 're lovely , " the tall man whispered gravely . Knight laughed , clapping Ferguson on the shoulder . " Pedestrian , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned . " Yes ? " " Glad to have you with us. " 87  | Noon . And still no sign of Beshlenkov . Each of them had taken a two-hour shift in the lobby and once again it was Knight 's turn . Anyone taking the trouble to notice the casually dressed man with the Agfa slung over his shoulder would have seen nothing more than a typical tourist whiling away some time before the next city tour . Traffic in the lobby was picking up ; it was checkout time and buses , limousines and taxis were depositing new arrivals in front of the Hotel Wien . They poured through the door and spilled across the lobby  --  sleepy-eyed , unshaven Frenchmen , Englishmen , Americans , Italians , Germans , Scandinavians , Japanese , and their wives , all bent on being first to settle into the hotel . The reception desk was bedlam as each new arrival demanded attention . Knight 's eyes scanned the crowd , automatically not seeing the women and screening out all men noticeably under or over Beshlenkov 's five feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guests in great gulps and the lobby was empty except for a few habitual loungers . Knight sauntered over to the corner occupied by the hospitality desk of the International Biology Association , now tended by a slight , scholarly-looking young Austrian who sat behind it with his feet entwined around the front legs of the chair . The table was covered with a snowy white cloth on top of which stacks of programs were neatly piled next to a guest register . To one side was a large open box of plastic identification badges , with spaces through which name plates could be inserted . A stand holding a variety of small flags grouped together like a bouquet of flowers stood in front of a typewriter . The young man was idly fingering a large ledger book when Knight , wearing an ingratiating smile , ambled over to him . " Hi , " he said .  | " Good afternoon . May I help you ? " " I sure hope so . " Knight leaned over the desk confidentially and said , " See that clerk over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I mean the one standing all hunched over , writing . " " Yes ? " " He suggested I come over here to find out if an outsider could squeeze into one or two of your seminars . " " Impossible , I 'm afraid . The rooms are quite small and every symposium is already fully subscribed . " " Is n't that a kick in the teeth ? Here I am , six thousand lonesome miles away from the States , with a chance to hear some of the world 's greatest scientists , and just because I 'm not a member ... Look , I studied biology in college and although I 'm in business now , I really dig it . Just between us , I 've seen enough castles and cathedrals to last a lifetime . " Still leaning over the table , Knight reached for his wallet and took out four hundredschilling notes . Folding them ostentatiously around a finger , he pointed to the young man . " I 'd really appreciate it if you could do something for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression went hard . " I 'm sure you do n't mean to be insulting , but it 's out of the ? " " Hey , no offense , friend , " Knight said , withdrawing his hand and , in so doing , sending most of the programs sailing into the air . The young man dropped to his hands and knees to retrieve them . Knight joined him , but not before pocketing an identification badge and a program . When they had gathered the scattered folders , he helped the Austrian to his feet and solicitously brushed the young man 's jacket . " Awful sorry about that . " The young man sat down again and regained his composure . " Friends ? " Knight asked ingratiatingly , extending his hand . The young man hesitated , then took it . " Before I leave , can you tell me something ? " " What ? " There was resignation in his voice . " Has Professor Beshlenkov arrived yet ? " " Why do you ask ? " " I 've been an admirer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seeing him in person . " 89  | " I 'll check . " He opened the ledger to B and ran a finger down the page . " No , " he said , looking up , " not yet . He is something of a prima donna , you know . " " Is that a fact ? " " Oh , yes . But genius has its privileges . " " True enough . Well , thanks for all your patience . " His voice dropped confidentially . " About what happened before  --  I 'm really sorry . Call it bad judgment . No hard feelings ? " Back in his chair , Knight waved to the young man across the room and wondered how far he had set back Austro-American relations . By the time Ferguson relieved him , he was chafing under the enforced idleness . As soon as he spotted the Irishman , he shook his head curtly and headed for the elevator . Six hours later , he repeated the exchange with Ferguson and went directly to Pedestrian 's room . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked inquiringly at his visitor . " No sign , " Knight said . " Jumpy ? " " I never enjoy the waiting part . " " An occupational hazard . " " He is coming , is n't he ? " " He 'll be here , all right . Harcourt would tell us if we were wasting our time . " " What do you intend to do when he arrives ? " " Find out what room he 's in , for one thing . See what the opposition looks like , for another . Try to compare him with the current Martin Duboff , for a third . " Knight reached into his pocket . " I have a convention program , but there 's no way of telling which meetings Beshlenkov will choose to attend . Many of them go on simultaneously ; I suppose you attend the ones you 're most interested in . " " Is he speaking at any of them ? " " Negative . Inescapable conclusion : we grab him tomorrow night , probably during the reception . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " For you , " Knight said , handing Pedestrian the identification badge . " It should n't be difficult to get into the Grand Ballroom  | along with several hundred other people . And I want you for backup . " " Where 's your badge ? " " Do n't need one . I 'll be there as a waiter . " " Why not simply get another badge " ' " There 's no guarantee of getting next to Beshlenkov that way ; he 'll probably be surrounded by admirers . A waiter can push past anyone , even the KGB , without arousing suspicion . " Knight picked up the telephone . Sexy Voice answered after the fourth ring . " I hope I have the right number . " " How may we help you ? " " I 'll need a few things . " " What , please ? " " Got a pencil ? " " Yes . " " Okay . But this is only a preliminary list , you understand . There 's likely to be more . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waiter 's uniform for the Hotel Wien , used , size forty-two regular , U.S. measurement . Inseam thirty-two inches ; waist thirty- four inches . And I mean used  --  shiny from years of cleaning and pressing . A pair of plain black shoes to match , size eleven C. " " Anything more ? " " Two , an ordinary suitcase , U.S. manufacture , the most ordinary-looking one you can find . Also used , and containing clothing with U.S. labels appropriate for a male tourist , five feet nine , size thirty-eight regular , US measurement , visiting Vienna for a week . Couple of suits , shirts , pants , underwear , socks , handkerchiefs , size eight D shoes  --  the works . " " Yes ? " " Three , a pair of two-inch lifts for a man . " " Bitte ? I beg your pardon ? " " Devices to increase a man 's height . They 're inserted into the heel portion of a pair of shoes . " " I understand . Anything more ? " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly . "  | " That 's room twelve twenty-seven . " " I know . " " I 'm impressed . " " I 'm glad . " Suddenly the voice was gone . Knight stood with the receiver in his hand for a moment , enjoying a subliminal vision of Laura , then slowly cradled it . " Our quartermaster ? " asked Pedestrian . " Something like that . " Pedestrian slumped into a chair and lazily crossed his legs . " How long do we watch the lobby ? " He lit a cigarette . " Until midnight . Unless he 's being driven , Beshlenkov should be here by then . If he is n't , he 'll certainly arrive tomorrow . " The telephone rang and both men pounced on it . Pedestrian yielded to Knight . It was Ferguson , his voice shaky with excitement . " He 's here , Jim ! " he whispered . " And Christ , he 's got three Mack trucks on legs with him . They 're at the desk now . " " We 're on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jerked his thumb over his shoulder . " Stay here , " Knight whispered . He smiled at Pedestrian and began talking animatedly as they walked toward the desk . " ... So what could I possibly do under the circumstances ? Fold up and run away ? Out of the question ! I raise him a hundred and ask for one card . Now remember , I 'm thousands of miles from Cleveland , there 's over eight hundred dollars in the pot and all I have is a hundred and eighty in cash and an out-of-date American Express card . Two of them cave in on the spot , but Wilbur and Orville are n't having any of it . Oh , no ? " At the desk now , no more than four feet from a KGB man , Knight interrupted himself . " Any messages for twelve twenty-seven ? " " I 'll see , sir , " a clerk said . While they waited , Knight and Pedestrian studied the Russians . The KGB men were virtually interchangeable  --  three dour , blunt instruments serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , vicious by training , undoubtedly armed . Beshlenkov was a disappointment . He looked spent , almost frag-  | ile beneath the dark coat draped over his shoulders . Shifting a lighted cigarette from one hand to another , he signed his registration card  --  room 2435 ? laboriously , as if it were a great effort to do so . For a moment his eyes met Knight 's , then turned wearily away . It struck Knight that they lacked the magnetic quality so evident in the photograph . It must have been a tiring journey . " For you , sir , " the clerk said , returning with an envelope in his IL hand . Knight tore it open , read it impassively and crammed it into a pocket . I'I I The Russians , insisting on carrying their own luggage , started for the elevator , followed by Knight and Pedestrian . They passed Ferguson who , correctly interpreting a fleeting nod by Knight as an order to join them , squeezed past two of the KGB men and found himself standing behind the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 button ; Knight pressed 15 . Pretending to read the advertisements posted in the elevator , Knight pivoted lazily and compared Beshlenkov with Ferguson . He was shorter by the expected two inches , a bit more gaunt and slender  --  though that was difficult to judge because of the coat  --  with a complexion somewhat darker than Ferguson 's . Given enough uninterrupted time , transforming him into Martin Duboff would not present any insurmountable problems . As he turned to face front , Knight became aware of how much more crowded the elevator appeared to be than it actually was because of the mirrors ; they multiplied the occupants . Slowly fac-Ill ing front , he blinked his eyes rapidly in thought and looked out of the corners of his eyes . In the mirror to his left , standing in rows from back to front , were Ferguson and a KGB man ; Beshlenkov between the two other bodyguards ; himself and Pedestrian . To his right he saw the same grouping from another angle . His eyes shifted back and forth , checking on the illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pedestrian . " Join me for a drink , George ? " he asked loudly . " Sounds good . " The elevator stopped at 15 . Ferguson pushed his way past the Russians and joined the two , who were already walking down the stairs to the twelfth floor .  | In their room , the Irishman removed the rubber piece from his nostril and stroked his nose . " Does n't look like such valuable merchandise to me , " he said . " Then why three bodyguards ? " Pedestrian asked , lighting a cigarette . " He 's valuable all right , " Knight said . " Something happened in the elevator just now , did n't it , Rain-bow ? " " What ? " " An idea . You had an idea . I could tell . " " Maybe . Look , I have to check on something . I 'll be back in ten minutes . Do n't go away . " He slammed the door behind him . When he returned , he looked pleased . " I think it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Pedestrian said . " All right . Listen ... " As if to keep up with his own racing brain , Knight began to pace the floor . " All along , we 've known what our big problem was  --  getting Beshlenkov away from the KGB long enough to turn him into Martin Duboff . I 've been wrestling with that from the beginning and I 'm convinced we have only three options . One , simple abduction from his room  --  impractical because of the bodyguards . Two , murder . We eliminate the KGB and waltz off with the Professor . A possibility , but what guarantees do we have that we do n't slip up , or attract undue attention , or ? worst of all  --  end up as the victims ourselves ? Too risky . " " So what 's left ? " Ferguson asked . Knight squatted on the balls of his feet in front of his friend so that their faces were only inches apart . " Magic , Fergy , " he whispered . " Magic ? Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surprise . **27;902;TOOLONG . That kind of magic . If I know our KGB friends , they 're strictly ABC , cause-and-effect , think-in-a-straight-line strongarmers . Cross them and they 'll track you to the ends of the earth , corner you and systematically stomp your face to a pulp . But shake them up with a surprise or two , something they have n't been programmed for , and they 're not good improvisers . They 'll stop in  | their tracks like a run-down toy , scratch their heads and finally call Moscow for instructions . " " What illusion do you have in mind ? " Pedestrian asked . " Suppose we get Beshlenkov out of the Grand Ballroom and away from his guards just long enough to get him into an eleva-tor ? " " They follow , " said Pedestrian . " ? but the door closes in their faces ? ? " " They watch the floor indicator above the elevator . " " ? and it goes all the way to the twenty-fourth floor ? " " One takes an elevator to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third presses the button and waits . " " And when the elevator returns , suppose it 's empty ? " " Then number three knows you either got off on twenty-four or are heading for the lobby in another elevator . " " But we do n't do either ! " " Then where the hell are you ? " Ferguson asked impatiently . Knight 's face radiated triumph . " We 're still in the elevator ! " " How ? " " I told you  --  magic . " " I do n't follow , Rainbow . " " We do it in the great magical tradition , " Knight explained , " with mirrors . " While Ferguson and Pedestrian exchanged guarded glances , he picked up the telephone , dialed the number and went through the familiar preliminaries . " This will be my final request , " he said . " Yes ? " " I need a wall . " 11 There was the slightest pause , no longer than the clearing of a throat , but absolutely no hint of surprise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please ? " " Part mirror , part wood , with a handrail . I ca n't describe it accurately over the phone ; someone will have to come to the hotel and see for himself . It must be a perfect replica of the rear wall of one of the elevators and it will have to be installed about ten inches in front of the real wall before nine-thirty tomorrow night . Its purpose will be to form a false area where two men can stand con-  | cealed . That means it must be able to be opened and closed quickly , like a door , yet match the other walls and look authentic enough to fool anybody when it 's in place . " " One moment , please . " The line seemed to go dead for a minute , then the voice returned . " Please call back in two hours . " " Problems ? " No . But if you will call back in two hours , we should be able to tell you which elevator will be equipped with your wall . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since it 's highly likely that my life will depend on this , I 'd appreciate a first-class job . " " We understand . Please call back in two hours . " He hung up . " Do you think it 'll work , Jim ? " Ferguson could not recall ever having heard his friend refer to his own mortality that way . Knight consulted his wristwatch . " We 'll know in less than twenty-three hours . " Pedestrian sat hunched forward in his chair , painstakingly examining the carpet between his legs . " We 'll make it work , " he said . Armed with a strategy at last , Knight grew restless . " Well , " he said , turning to Pedestrian and rubbing his hands together like a hungry man anticipating a splendid meal , " all you and I have to do now is figure out the final piece of the puzzle  --  getting the good professor away from his watchdogs long enough to make it to the elevator . " He looked around the room disapprovingly . " I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ferguson waggled the pacifier tip perched on his little finger . " Want me along ? " " No need . Your makeup 's beginning to fray around the edges and this is no time to blow Martin Duboff . Relax for now , Fergy . We 'll be back in half an hour . " He nodded to Pedestrian who was putting on his jacket . Outside the hotel the street was nearly deserted . Under a moonless sky a cold wind whipped across Johannesgasse , driving idle strollers into the coffee shops and cafes . The two men walked beneath a series of street lamps which alternately cast their shad-  | ows in front of , then behind them . Pedestrian moved quietly , with assurance , perfectly at home in the darkness . " I 'm not too keen on your idea , " he said softly , looking straight ahead . " Explain . " " There is a period of time during which you will be completely helpless , confined in a very small space , with no possible exit . The first rule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't . " Knight shook his head . " You 're wrong . The first rule is , as long as you know the rules , you 're allowed to break them . I know them ; I can break them . " " Furthermore , " the tall man said , " You 're betting your life that the opposition wo n't notice that the elevator 's been altered . The second rule is , never underestimate your enemy . " " And a good rule it is . But there 's a time to be bold and in my judgment this is such a time . I do n't know what Beshlenkov has that we want and I do n't care , but it 's obvious we want it so bad , we can taste it . A few days ago Harcourt told me that that tired old guy we saw in the lobby is the most important man on earth . If I accept that  --  and I do because it 's my job  --  how can I not put my life on the line ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let a streetcar clatter by . On the other side , in front of the park , Knight continued : " Besides , as I 've told Fergy , people see what they expect to see . When that KGB ape stares into the elevator and sees nothing but his own reflection , nothing else is going to register . He 'll hop into it and zoom to the twenty-fourth floor to help his comrade . Remember , they 've just lost a national treasure ; they 're going to be scared to death . " " You make it sound so plausible . You should have been a salesman . " Knight patted Pedestrian 's shoulder . " It 'll work . You 'll see . But now , you tell me something : how do we get the Professor away from his keepers ? " " A diversion of some sort ? An accident ? A fight ? Both ? " " Can you keep the three of them occupied for thirty seconds ? That 's what I 'll need to get to the elevator with Beshlenkov . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . a push  --  it can be done . " " All right , then . A fight it is . But watch me before you start it .  | The Professor must be alerted and ready to go before we make our move . " Pedestrian inhaled the night air deeply , then exhaled noisily , with the deep satisfaction of a smoker . " The juices are flowing , Rainbow . One thing , though . What was the message you received at the desk ? " Knight reached into his pocket and held out the crumpled paper . " See for yourself . " Pedestrian read it under a street lamp : " Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country . " He queried Knight with his eyes . " I planted it earlier in case I needed a reason to go to the desk . " " Do n't you overlook anything ? " " Let 's hope not . " While Pedestrian and Knight continued their walk , a handsome young couple in evening dress entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the lobby , disappeared into an elevator . Once the door closed , the girl 's visage lost its carefree look and turned deadly serious . She stopped talking in mid-sentence , opened her purse and from it took a tape measure which she handed to her escort . Working swiftly , he measured the rear wall of the elevator , then the mirror and the length and circumference of the brass handrail . As he called out each measurement , the girl jotted it down in a notebook . Finally , he opened a pocket knife and gouged out a small piece of wood at the very bottom of the wall , covering the scarred area with a soft wax furniture crayon . Before leaving the elevator , he knelt and examined the carpeting . They got out on the eighteenth floor and took another elevator down to the second floor , repeating the exercise . Then they rode a third elevator up to the twentieth floor and a fourth one down to the third floor . On two occasions they could do nothing because of the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had measured , examined and gathered carefully numbered wood samples from all eight elevators in the Hotel Wien . When they were through , they descended to the lobby and began arguing on their way out , the girl several steps in front of the man .  | " Du benimmst dich Kindisch ! " he stormed . Several guests paused in mid-conversation to observe the domestic quarrel . The night clerk looked up disapprovingly from his newspaper . " Lass mich in Ruhe ! " the girl replied , hugging the mink wrap to her body and quickening her pace . " Ich sag dir alien Ernstes : wenn du jetzt gehst ist es aus mit uns . " She stopped in front of the revolving door and turned to him . " Gott sei Dank ! " she screamed , sweeping out of the lobby . " Anna ! " He plunged through the spinning doors . The night clerk shrugged his shoulders and returned to his newspaper . Amidst a chorus of tch-tch 's , conversations resumed . Outside the hotel the man caught up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Opel sedan , its motor running , awaited them . They climbed into the back seat , the door slammed shut and the car turned slowly into Johannesgasse . They had recrossed the street and were walking back to the hotel , working out the details of the following evening , when the distant hoo-ha of an ambulance sliced through the night . " Perhaps I should be the one behind the wall with Beshlenkov , " Pedestrian suggested . " I 'm slender . Ten inches would be room enough for me . " " Out of the question . It 's my plan , my risk . Besides , they will have seen you . I 'll be disguised . " " I wish you 'd reconsider . " " Let 's get back . Fergy 's a regular mother hen and if we are n't in that room half an hour after leaving it , as promised , he 'll start laying eggs . " A car pulled over to the curb as the ambulance , its siren insistently strident , bounced over the streetcar tracks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel entrance as the ambulance sped by from the opposite direction . Pedestrian said something that Knight could n't make out over the siren . They were in front of the alley next to the hotel when Knight , looking up at his companion , asked , " What ? " Pedestrian pushed him roughly into the alley where he fell , pinned to the ground by the tall man who was suddenly on top of him , holding his wrists tightly above his head . He thrashed his  | legs , seeking leverage , but in vain . " Do n't move ! " Pedestrian ordered sharply . The air sighed overhead as the ambulance rushed by , its mournful bray already fading , and something touched his face . He struggled to get free , but Pedestrian 's grip was steel . " You sonofabitch , " Knight said between clenched teeth .  | " Quiet , " Pedestrian whispered . Knight knew it was useless to struggle as long as he was held that way . Sooner or later , though , his assailant would have to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? Slowly the grip relaxed and Pedestrian was helping him to his feet . Knight shook himself free and retreated into the alley and its shadows , away from the tall man . " What the hell was that all about ? " His fingers curled involuntarily . Pedestrian raised his hands in mock surrender and backed off . " Somebody just tried to kill us , " he said matter-of-factly . " The last thing I saw before the headlights hit my eyes was a machine pistol in the side window of that ambulance . There was no time to explain . " Knight looked at Pedestrian , then at the alley wall , where the bullets had torn off chunks of brick . His fingers slowly relaxed . " My error , " he said . " All right if I brush you off ? " The tall man patted some dust from Knight 's shoulders , then pushed his own hair back . " Your cheek is scratched . Must have been a ricochet . " Knight touched his face . " It 's nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street just now ? We only decided to take a walk a little while ago . " " They may not be who you think they are . " " What do you mean ? " " I mean I 've made a lot of enemies in my time . That trigger could have been pulled by Bulgarians , East Germans , Red Chinese , half a dozen others . Then there 's always the possibility that you 're the target . " Pedestrian pondered the idea briefly . " Maybe . But I 'm not convinced . " " Still  --  a possibility . " " A possibility , " Pedestrian conceded . " But whoever they were , they knew where to find us . How ? " " A phone call from the lobby ... someone on a roof or in the 101  | park with a walkie-talkie .. . any of a hundred guests with binoculars and a room facing the street  --  who knows ? " " You understand what this means ? " Knight nodded curtly . " A leak . Somehow , somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know the security at GVC . It 's impossible . " Knight scowled . " The third rule is , nothing 's impossible . Give me a cigarette . " He saw Pedestrian 's eyebrows rise . " And shut up . " The possibility of a blown cover cast an entirely new aspect on the operation , not the least of which was security . If it was the KGB that had spotted Knight , it followed that his room was bugged , his telephone tapped , his plans known . Immediately upon entering room 1227 he turned the radio up full blast and signaled Pedestrian to carry on a conversation with Ferguson . While they loudly extolled the beauties of Vienna , Knight examined the room , its furnishings , fixtures , pictures , doorways , windows , carpeting and drapes . Nothing . The bathroom proved above suspicion . He dismantled the telephone and found it clean , too . At his silent command , they huddled in mid-room . " Nothing , unless the phone 's being monitored outside , " he whispered . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pitching his voice even lower . " Take a few basic precautions from here on in , " Knight said , " and go ahead as planned . " " But , Jim ? " " If they really knew , we 'd be dead by now . " " But the ambulance ? " " I 'm beginning to think there was no connection . Why do it outside , with possible witnesses ? And why not try for you too , Fergy ? " Ferguson , who could not see what his lack of field experience had to do with his ability or right to help plan strategy , argued for seeking new instructions from Washington . Knight pointed out that he had only one mission : get Beshlenkov . The longer they waited , the greater the danger grew . Consequently , he had no in-102  | tention of departing from the plan or its timetable . Pedestrian went along with the idea on one condition , that he be allowed to join Knight and the Professor in Munich . Reluctantly , Knight agreed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ferguson said . He called from a telephone booth and was surprised to hear a man 's voice answer the familiar preliminary . " Where 's the lady ? " he asked . " Even she must sleep occasionally , Rainbow . " " And my wall ? " " It 's being constructed now . I have the following information for you . " He hesitated for a moment , as if looking for something , then proceeded : " It will be installed in the fourth elevator from the left because the carpet in that one is the most worn . When you close the wall , there will be a minimum of drag and no marks to give you away . " " How do I open it ? " " I was just coming to that . When you enter the elevator , feel under the rear of the right handrail . You 'll find a leather thong taped there . Pull it and the wall will swing open like a door . Once you 're behind the wall , use the thong to close it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe ? " " No problem . In order to move easily , the wall must be fractionally lower than the ceiling and higher than the floor . You may perspire somewhat , but you will be able to breathe . " " Will it be in place by nine-thirty ? " " It will . " " How are you getting it into the hotel ? " " Leave that to us . " " One more thing : I 'll need twenty-four Out of Service ' signs to make sure the elevator is available when I want it . " " Of course . Is there anything else ? " " No . " " Then good luck . " " I 'll take all of that I can get . " When they returned from a late Sunday breakfast , they found a suitcase and a package neatly centered on Knight 's bed . 103  | " You ca n't fault the service , " Ferguson said , snapping open the suitcase , " that 's for sure . " He tried on a tweed jacket in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wee bit conservative for my patrician taste . " Knight had opened the package and was examining his waiter 's uniform . It met all specifications , down to the shine on the trousers and frayed cuffs . The lifts were in the shoes . " Our friends are better than their word , " he said , glancing at his watch . " Not even noon yet . " It was a comforting thought for someone awaiting the rush delivery of an elevator wall . Now if Pedestrian could keep those goons occupied for the necessary thirty seconds ... " What 's next ? " asked Ferguson . " You return to Munich tonight and , assuming everything works out , Beshlenkov takes over the role of Martin Duboff . " " Sure you wo n't be needing me for anything else ? As long as I 'm here , I mean , and at my fighting weight ? " " You 've already made your contribution , Fergy . All that 's left is to post those signs , then get the hell back to the office . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone and dialed the airport . The last flight to Munich , he was informed , left at 11:00 P.M. Knight began removing his makeup . It was , Pedestrian thought , as he watched with rapt attention , like being allowed backstage at a theater . For the last thirty-five minutes he had witnessed the transformation of a young man into a middle-aged waiter . Gray , balding head ... slack neck supporting a slightly sagging face . . . prominent nose  --  there was precious little left of James Knight except perhaps his dark , brooding eyes . But even those disappeared under gray contact lenses . " What do you think , young fella ? " Knight asked in a voice several registers huskier than his own . He closed his shirt , snapped on a bow tie and slipped into the jacket . " I would never recognize you . " " The question is , would you accept a drink from this man ? " Knight rose and , stooping slightly , unfurled a towel across his arm . " Champagne , mein Herr ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door sent Ferguson , a hand clamped over his naked face , running into the bathroom .  | " You get it , " Knight said to Pedestrian , opening a closet door and pretending to search for something behind it . A messenger stood in the doorway with a large , thick envelope in his hand . " For room twelve twenty-seven , " he explained , and left without waiting for a tip . " It 's all right , " Pedestrian announced . He handed the envelope to Knight , who fingered it open . Twenty-four neatly printed signs declared in German and English that the elevator was temporarily out of service . " For you , " Knight said to Ferguson . He pointed to his wrist . " It 's a little after eight now . I want them posted by no later than nine twenty-five . Fourth elevator from the left . Got it ? " Ferguson made a circle with thumb and forefinger . " Then get out of town . " While the three men in room 1227 were discussing their evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowels of the Hotel Wien , struggling to negotiate the winding corridors of the subbasement while supporting a large , flat and , judging from the grimaces on their faces , heavy burden . Their trip seemed endless as they wound their way through the labyrinth , at the same time carefully avoiding bumping their precious cargo against the pipes that serpentined their way along the ceiling . " A left here , then a right to a staircase , " the leader finally whispered . Minutes later , breathing hard , they found themselves in the basement in front of the elevators . They leaned their enormous package against a wall and began unwrapping it , carefully folding the rapidly accumulating paper and cardboard . It was a remarkably accurate duplicate of the rear elevator wall , constructed of the same fine mahogany and glass as the original . Even in the dim basement light , the brass rail gleamed . " Be glad this crazy Rainbow does n't require an elephant , " one of them grunted as they repositioned the wall closer to the elevator doors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button for the fourth elevator from the left . " What if someone 's in the elevator ? " " We excuse ourselves and wait . We 're workmen , right ? It 's natural . "  | The elevator was empty . Tilting the wall and shuffling under its weight , they managed to get it through the doorway . As the door closed , one of them jammed it with a work shoe . The door opened again and slammed into the shoe as it tried to close . " It wo n't take them long to notice that something 's wrong , " he observed . " So we work fast and pray a little , " the leader replied . He dropped to one knee and reached into a capacious back pocket for a tape measure . The door opened and slammed partially shut with a thud . The shoe shuddered . " Ten inches , right ? " He unhooked a brace that dangled from his belt . Minutes later , as he was screwing in the two large door hinges on which the wall would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued its fruitless opening and closing at fifteen-second intervals . " Shut up , goddamn it , " he muttered . The other two men lifted the wall gingerly and , after two unsuccessful tries , positioned it precisely on the hinges . Behind the wall , the leader dropped in the securing hinge pins . The buzzer kept sounding as the door blindly , repeatedly thudded partially shut , then opened . " Swing it closed now , " the leader said , getting out of the way . " Eas " The two pushed the wall shut under his watchful eye . He took a rag and a small oil can out of another pocket . " Open , " he ordered . They pulled it open . He stepped behind the wall again and oiled the hinges , holding the rag under them as he did so . His eyes narrowed while he examined the new wall . It was a miraculously good fit and the illusion was complete . " Okay . Tape the thong under that rail . " The buzzing and the door were getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator . " What do you think ? " he asked his men . One was using a hand vacuum on the carpeting to get rid of the sawdust and shavings left by the brace . " Looks good to me , " he said , straightening up . The other nodded agreement . " Okay . Let 's go . " The leader picked up the shoe . " Now , you motherless bastard  --  close ! " The two men gathered the paper and cardboard and carried them in their arms like infants as they returned to the subbasement , made their way to the rear entrance of the hotel and into a waiting truck . 106  | It took Ferguson eighteen minutes to post all the signs . The one for the lobby presented the biggest problem , but he solved it by waiting until the coast was momentarily clear , then working with his hands behind his back . One moment he was standing with his back to the elevator ; the next , he was strolling away and the sign III was in place . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you guys , " he said , jerking a thumb upwards . " See you in Munich . Tell the Professor to take good care of my beard . " Minutes later , he stepped out of an elevator on the third floor and took the stairs the rest of the way . No one paid attention to him as he walked quickly along the front wall of the lobby . He spotted his junior nemesis of the previous evening standing near the revolving door , engrossed in a German comic book . There was no question in his mind about what had to be done . He was already through the door and hailing a cab with a beatific smile as the little boy screamed out in pain . Someone had mercilessly pinched his left buttock . Passing himself off as a waiter was n't difficult . Knight had fully mastered the air of resigned weariness and the flat-footed gait that are the hallmarks of that European fraternity . When he joined the others in the kitchen , the Grand Ballroom was already filling up with guests ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who he was . People do see what they expect to see , and clearly he was a waiter . The banquet was scheduled for 11:00 P.M. From 9:00 until 10:30 drinks would be served , then the room cleared . In the intervening half hour , fully set tables would miraculously appear beneath the bunting and the huge welcome sign . The guests would be reconvened and seated , and the meal served . Right now genteel chaos reigned as more than eight hundred biologists , speaking in a dozen different tongues , met old friends with delight , cocked ears to catch introductions , listened to one another , nodded sagely . The waiters snaked their way through the crowd , trays held high , pausing to offer champagne cocktails to anyone with empty hands . There were collisions , polite excuses , occasional concealed shock at the unexpected damage time had inflicted on old acquaintances . Gossip and shoptalk commingled beneath the blue-gray layers of tobacco smoke that rose reluctantly to the chandeliers .  | It was on his fourth trip from the kitchen that Knight spotted Pedestrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that when he stopped moving , it would be because he was close to Beshlenkov . The fact that no biologist in the room was less than three inches shorter than Pedestrian made it all the easier to keep him in view . He stopped moving at 10:10 . Knight was in the kitchen at the time , waiting for another tray of drinks . He had just reentered the Grand Ballroom and sighted the stationary Pedestrian across the cavernous room when he was descended upon by a horde of thirsty biologists and forced to return to the kitchen . He elbowed his way past several protesting waiters and restocked his tray out of turn , triggering a chorus of German invectives that followed him back to the swing-door . He shouldered it open and made straight for Pedestrian , ignoring all requests for his services along the way , hoping to God that Beshlenkov was ready for another drink . The Professor , surrounded by a knot of admirers , was holding court . He looked refreshed now and was speaking rapidly in German , jabbing the air with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood beside him ; the other two were outside the immediate circle , their eyes ceaselessly roaming the crowd . As Knight passed Pedestrian on his way to the Beshlenkov group , one of the KGB men stopped him with an open hand against his chest . Knight looked at him inquisitively . The other one smilingly removed two glasses from the tray and handed one to his comrade . The first lowered his arm and bowed his thanks . " Bitte , " Knight said . Pedestrian moved closer to the circle , his back to the group . Knight boldly broke into the circle and addressed Beshlenkov , who was still sipping his cocktail . " Noch ein Glas , Herr Professor ? " Beshlenkov peered at Knight , then at the half-consumed drink in his hand with amusement . " fa , bestimmt . Ein Moment . " He drained his glass and exchanged it for a full one . Amidst laughter , several hands reached for refills . Taking advantage of their eagerness , Knight tipped the tray , splashing most of the contents of two glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , including Beshlenkov 's bodyguard , instinctively jumped back . Pedestrian , tensed for the incident , made sure the KGB man bumped into him .  | He wheeled around , his jaw taut with rage . " You clumsy idiot ! Look what you 've done ! " he shouted , holding his own empty glass up and pointing to a wet sleeve . The KGB man looked uncomprehendingly at the tall stranger , then at his two friends who were grinning at his discomfiture . Knight 's tray was on the floor and he was bending over Beshlenkov , wiping his jacket with a handkerchief and stuttering abject apologies . While everyone 's attention was riveted on Pedestrian , he whispered , " Get ready , Professor . We 're going now . " If Beshlenkov understood , he gave no sign . For an awful moment the paralyzing thought that Harcourt might have failed to have the Russian alerted flashed through Knight 's brain . No matter ; if necessary , he would drag the good Professor to the elevator . Pedestrian had just slapped the KGB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm of his hand , then with the back . The KGB man reddened , growled like an animal , lunged at him . As he did , he saw the tall man 's knee flex ; his very next impression was of someone 's smashing a club into his testicles . The color drained from his face as raw pain coursed through his body and he collapsed to the floor with a groan , clutching his damaged genitals . Few guests outside the immediate circle were aware of what was happening , and those closest to the scene were rendered dumb by it ; they merely watched in fascination . Hundreds of voices around the Grand Ballroom continued their conversations and goodnatured laughter . As Knight was instructing Beshlenkov to walk to the doorway with him , the other two KGB men sprang into action . They circled Pedestrian cautiously , like wrestlers looking for an opening . He backed away , head swiveling from side to side , keeping both in view . The realization that something was wrong washed across the room like a slow-breaking wave as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle around them . While Knight guided Beshlenkov toward the door , Pedestrian faced one of the KGB agents . As the other approached him from behind , he suddenly balanced himself on his left leg , bending it slightly . His right leg shot out behind him and his foot sank joltingly into the man 's solar plexus . The Russian stumbled back , clawing at the air for support , nearly fell but recovered . He came again , but this time Pedestrian whirled to meet him , kicking  | up his left leg this time , and caught the breathless Russian in the throat . Gagging , he grabbed it , coughed , gagged again , fell against a group of spectators and collapsed . The other Russian leaped on the tall man from behind and threw a powerful arm lock around his neck ; immediately a long leg twined itself around his , sending both men crashing to the floor , Pedestrian atop his attacker . The arm lock , however , only grew stronger . Another few seconds of that pressure , Pedestrian knew , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a last burst of strength , he raised his arms high and brought both elbows down forcefully into the KGB man 's ribs . The arm lock grew weaker , but held . Pedestrian drove his elbows down again and this time the Russian let go with a moan . The first one , sighting Knight and the Professor , staggered to his feet and pointed . " Beshlenkov ! " he cried out hoarsely . The second scrambled to his feet and , reaching into his jacket , pursued the figures of the waiter and Beshlenkov . Pedestrian leaped to his feet and went after the second Russian , now moving faster than seemed possible for a burly man . Pistol drawn , he was closing in on Knight . Pedestrian 's feet seemed barely to touch the floor as he gained on the guard . Then they were no longer on the floor and Pedestrian was high in the air , flying it seemed , his legs drawn up under him for a moment , only to lash out parallel to the ground , smash into the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Russian fell forward and slid like a tenpin along the polished floor , still gripping the pistol . Pedestrian was upon him immediately , grinding a heel into the pistol hand and , once the weapon fell from the hand , kicking it across the room . He saw Knight watching him . " Go ! " he shouted , waving him away . Knight steered Beshlenkov by one elbow toward the elevators . Pedestrian stationed himself in the center of the doorway . Both Russians scrambled to their feet and moved toward him . The first , motioning with a pistol , waved him aside , but Pedestrian shook his head and advanced slowly as the Russian released the safety . Pedestrian leaped to one side and , almost simultaneously , kicked up one long leg with blurring speed , sending the pistol arcing over the crowd . Amidst shouts of warning , it fell somewhere halfway across  | the room with a clatter . Another kick , this time to the jaw , jolted the Russian backward . His partner took advantage of the moment to pass through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pedestrian was in pursuit . While the first Russian was dazedly shaking his head , Knight was pressing the elevator button . The second Russian shouted something at Beshlenkov , then fell to one knee as a result of a powerful kick in the thigh from the rear . The top of Knight 's thumb was turning red from the pressure exerted on the button . He could see that the elevator was descending from the eleventh floor , but never in recorded history had an elevator moved so slowly . He watched Pedestrian struggling with the Russian on the floor , thinking that if Beshlenkov were indeed the most important man on earth , then at this moment the skinny kid rolling on the carpet with the square-faced Slav was fighting for the world 's richest purse . The elevator had passed the seventh floor when the other two appeared , one still grasping his crotch in agony , the other shaking his head in an effort to clear it . They stood side by side for a moment , as if their brains could not quite absorb what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting muffled orders through Pedestrian 's fingers . The sixth floor . The Russian with his hands between his legs was useless , but his companion , finally comprehending what he was witnessing , made for Knight , carefully sidestepping the men on the floor . Knight took his thumb off the button and stepped in front of Beshlenkov . The fifth floor . The two men had rolled over to a wall and the Russian , on top now , was trying to smash Pedestrian 's head against it . Pedestrian had other ideas . He braced both hands against the wall and kicked blindly backward , feeling his heel sink into something soft . The Russian cursed , but did not let go . The fourth floor . Wondering why he had n't carried a knife with him , Knight tensed his body . No middle-aged waiter in the Russian 's experi-  | ence had ever moved so swiftly and he was unprepared for the right cross that exploded in his face . The third floor . He came at Knight again , crouching like some boxer out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , weaving , weaving . Knight clasped his hands together and raised them high above his own head , then brought them crashing down on the Russian 's head , knocking him to the floor . The Russian grabbed his trouser cuff , but Knight tore free . The elevator opened silently , but it was not empty . A slim Italian who did not believe in signs was leaning casually against a handrail . For one wild moment , he and Knight looked at each other . " Lobby ? " the Italian asked , one eyebrow arching inquisitively . Knight grabbed his tie , yelled , " Out ! " and yanked him headlong into the corridor , almost driving him into the opposite wall . Pedestrian and the Russian had separated and were squaring off against each other again . When he saw peripherally that Beshlenkov and Knight were gone , Pedestrian broke away , ran for a doorway , slammed the door behind him and , breathing hard , raced up the stairs , taking them three at a time . The Russian started to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join him , sped down to the lobby . Knight punched the 24 button , swung open the false wall and helped the scientist , whose calmness under fire was impressive , take a position behind it . No sooner had he closed the wall than , thanks to the Italian , the elevator descended to the lobby level and its door slid open . The Russians caught it just before it closed , peered into the elevator , then ran across the lobby . There was an interminable wait before the elevator began its ascent . It stopped on the second floor again . The injured Russian entered , winced at his reflection in the mirror , faced the elevator door in silence . Behind the false wall , Knight puzzled over two thumping sounds , then understood : the KGB man with the damaged genitals was pounding the elevator door in frustration . At that moment Pedestrian 's opponent and friend were pushing through the revolving door and looking up , down and across Johannesgasse , then questioning the doorman . Communications were poor , but clearly Beshlenkov had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ninth floor , Pedestrian washed his face , gingerly probed a bump on his forehead , hurriedly changed clothes . He took only his passport and wallet and ten minutes later was four blocks away , climbing into a streetcar . When the Russian got off on the twenty-fourth floor , the elevator headed for the lobby . Knight opened the false wall , pressed the 14 button and escorted the Professor downstairs to room 1227 . Perspiring , Beshlenkov fell into a chair and accepted a glass of whisky . He gulped it down and fanned his face with one hand . After a minute he regarded his rescuer with amusement . His voice , surprisingly strong , bore only the slightest trace of an accent as he said , " A bit melodramatic , my friend  --  but a very effective operation . My congratulations . "  | Sunshine . Early traffic noises . Drawn curtains . All lights on . Beshlenkov was a willing conspirator , sitting patiently through his transformation into Martin Duboff , not even complaining of the nose insert . " My dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one criticism of these proceedings . " " What 's that , Professor ? " " Do you have to make me look quite so ugly while you have become so young and handsome ? " " A lot of thought went into that face , " Knight explained . " Try these . " Beshlenkov accepted the lifts , stepped out of his shoes and fit them in . " Let me see you walk . " Beshlenkov stood and strolled across the room without difficulty . " Very good . Obviously , you were meant to be taller . " The Russian laughed . " You 're right . But each of us , in his own way , devotes his life to becoming precisely that . " He offered Knight a cigarette , lit one himself and leaned against a bureau . " What happens now , if I may ask ? " " I think it best to stay here a day or two ; a sudden checkout might arouse suspicion . Then a regular commercial flight back to Munich and my apartment . In time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why not directly to Washington from here ? " " If you worked for the KGB and had had a Beshlenkov stolen from you under your nose in Vienna , where would you look for him ? " " At border crossings , in the train station and the airport  --  particularly those airlines heading for the United States ? " " Correct . What Washington does not want is an international incident before you are safely within the continental United States . And it most certainly does n't want to incriminate the Austrian government in any way . " " So . I am your guest , then . " He stubbed out his cigarette , lit  | another , rolled it between his fingers . " When we are in public , do I speak ? " " Better not to . Or at least keep your talking to a minimum . " " I am used to speaking my mind . Always . " " So I hear . " " What else do you hear ? " Knight was impressed with his pronunciation . No trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Temperamental . An iconoclast . " Beshlenkov-Duboff 's face broke into a wide grin . " That is true ! I am an iconoclast . People know ' so much that is not so . The world overflows with fools who say this can not be done , that can not be done . " He squinted at his burning cigarette . " What else do you hear ? " " That you are the most important man on earth . " " Oh ? " Beshlenkov looked up . " Who told you that ? " " My superior . " " He overestimates me . I am important and , perhaps , somewhat special , but he overestimates . " " He does n't think so . " " Do you know why he feels this way ? " " No . I 've made some guesses , but it does n't really matter . " " Tell me your guesses . We will make a game of it . " An egomaniac . Toying with him . Relishing his role . What the hell . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a biological weapon of some sort . " " That 's good , that 's very good . What kind of weapon do you think it is ? " " Deadly . A fast-working killer that eliminates people , cattle , all living things but , maybe , does n't contaminate the environment or is quickly rendered harmless . " " You have a logical mind , but you are wrong . " He shook his head . " Do you play chess ? " " A little . " " Do you have a chess set here ? " " No . At home . " " We shall play when we get there . I 'm very good . " " I 'm sure you are . " " Enough of me . Your work must be fascinating . How many scientists have you rescued ? " " You 're the first one . "  | " Am I ? Remarkable . You are an assassin , then ? " " No , Professor . " " But you have killed . You do your government 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears evil to the Kremlin is God 's work in the White House . And vice versa . " " Morality is geography , " Beshlenkov repeated softly . " You are not a stupid man , Mr. Knight . " " I hope not . " " We are vastly outnumbered , you know . The stupids sit in the saddle everywhere . In my entire life , I have admired only two people . " " Your parents ? " " No . I loved them , but I did not admire them . Not in the sense I mean . " " Who , then ? " " My first biology instructor and a woman I knew many years ago who possessed a mind like a diamond . Had she been a man  --  in those days  --  she would have set the world afire with her music . But she died young . It pains me yet to speak of her . " " I 'm sorry . " " Do n't be . Sorrow is a wasted emotion , the bribe we pay ourselves to expiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning his head from side to side , as if to grow better acquainted with the face he was now wearing . " Do you know our Stanislayski ? " " The director ? " " And actor . As a boy I had the pleasure of seeing him perform and I have read his books . I can not help but wonder who and what this Martin Duboff is . How did he get this terrible scar ? " He ran a finger tenderly along it . " An interesting exercise ... " A method actor , for Christ 's sake . " I do n't think that 's important here , Professor . All you have to do is be seen in the lobby , as the previous owner of the face was . We do n't want to break the continuity . " " I understand . But first , some breakfast , yes ? " " Yes . " Shortly after they returned from the dining room , there was a knock on the door . Knight turned the doorknob , signaling Beshlenkov to read a newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , stood stiffly before him .  | The first , obviously an officer , consulted a sheet of paper and looked up from it with a polite smile . " Am I addressing Mr. Knight or Mr. Duboff ? " " I 'm James Knight . " " Lieutenant Breitenstein of the Vienna Police . " He saluted . " This is Officer Schuster . " The man behind him bowed slightly . " May we enter ? " " Of course . " Breitenstein 's eyes took in the room . Beshlenkov dropped the newspaper to his lap and looked up . " This is Mr. Duboff ? " Beshlenkov nodded . Breitenstein avoided the face . " Have a seat , Lieutenant , " Knight said . " Thank you , no . We 'll stand . This is a routine matter , gentlemen , but because of the personalities involved we must chat with all the guests . May I see your passports ? " " Is anything wrong ? " Knight asked , getting them . The lieutenant ignored the question while he examined the passports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Possibly you heard talk ? " He returned the passports . " No . We overslept this morning and just returned from breakfast . " " Ah . " The lieutenant went into the bathroom . The shower door slid along its tracks . The medicine cabinet clicked open and shut . He returned . " You are tourists ? " " Yes . " " Enjoying Vienna ? " " Very much . " " How long will you be with us ? " " We intended to stay the week , but we may be leaving as early as Wednesday . " " Oh ? " " Some business matters in Munich . " " What business are you in , may I ask ? " " International investment . " Knight reached into his wallet and withdrew a card . " Perhaps you 've heard of us ? " Breitenstein examined the card , turned it over and over , handed it back . " I 'm afraid not . " " We have several properties in Austria . " " Do you ? " the lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enjoy Vienna , gentlemen . Sorry to have disturbed you . " He turned , followed by Schuster who closed the door soundlessly . The two men said nothing for a moment . From the hallway came the sound of a knock on another door and muffled talk . The door shut , the voices disappeared . Beshlenkov sighed . " How was I ? " he whispered . " Stanislayski would have been proud of you . " " They got away without a trace . " " That 's bad , " the man in the hat said . " We 'll try again . " The waiter came , hovered over them , took their order . After he left , the man in the hat leaned over to his companion . " It had better go well . Opportunities to eliminate Rainbow are few and far between . " " We know that . It will happen in Munich . My life on it . " " You never spoke more truly . " The other man closed his eyes . Traffic rolled by . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A last resort . A very last resort . It should not come to that . " I know . " He lifted his collar . " It 's cold . " " No better place to talk than a sidewalk cafe . " " It would be easy to take the girl . " The man in the hat peered at the sky . " Looks like rain , " he said . The world overflowed with incompetents . Beshlenkov turned the key in the lock as Knight was packing away his target . " You would have been proud of your protege , " the Russian announced . " I roamed through the lobby and , at one point , was as close to Kovnik as I am to you . He did n't flutter an eyelid ! " " Who 's Kovnik ? " " One of my escorts  --  the one your comrade fought with . What a fighter that one is ! His legs were everywhere ! " " Savate  --  French foot fighting . Just looking at him , I should have known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where is he now .. . if I am permitted to know ? "  | " Far away from here , if he 's smart . We 'll see him again . " " In Munich ? " Knight nodded . " Good . There 's much I 'd like to ask him . What an extraordinary young man . " When Knight removed Beshlenkov 's makeup that evening , the Professor watched in the mirror . " You are a man of many talents , " he said . " A few tricks , that 's all . " " But what tricks , my friend . Where did you learn disguises ? " " I once considered being an actor . " Beshlenkov looked interested . He twisted in his chair . " Did you ever perform ? " " Hold still , please , while I get this off . " Knight carefully peeled back the wig , lifted it off . He began brushing the Professor 's real hair , newly cut to accommodate the false hair , paused for a moment as if thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes  --  for a few summers after I graduated college . " " Were you ever in anything by Chekhov ? " " Too wordy for my taste . " " Ah , you do n't know what you have missed . The characterizations , the psychological nuances , the portrayal of an entire society in a living room , in a garden . " " I always preferred action roles . " They took a Wednesday afternoon flight for Munich . At the gate , Knight spotted a man clearly neither a passenger nor an airline employee who was surreptitiously studying the passengers as they boarded . Austrian police ? KGB ? He said nothing to Beshlenkov , but felt better when they were adjusting their seat belts . Airborne , he felt better still . The Professor leaned back in his seat next to the window and opened a newspaper . He thumbed through it rapidly , headline hunting , then turned to Knight . " Not a word ! " " Why advertise failure ? " " Not very flattering to the most important man on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised a cautionary finger to his lips . 119  | One hundred minutes later they emerged from a taxi near Knight 's apartment house . A street musician wearing dark glasses was playing a violin on the corner . " Rimsky-Korsakoff ! A countryman of mine , perhaps . Do you have a mark ? " Knight fished a coin out of his pocket . " I 'll be back in a moment , " Beshlenkov said , hurrying to the violinist . Knight watched them chat for a minute , then shake hands . Beshlenkov hurried back . " I was right , " he reported , eyes aglow . " He came to Munich as a boy from Kiev and failed in a number of businesses . An interesting fellow . Oh , do n't worry . I told him nothing of myself . " They crossed the cobbled courtyard . " It is almost as large as my own , " Beshlenkov marveled once they were in the apartment . " Make yourself comfortable , Professor . " While Beshlenkov toured the apartment , Knight flipped through some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the turntable . Music flooded the apartment , " The bathroom is over there . You can have the bedroom . I 'll couch it . " " You will what ? " " I 'll sleep on the couch . " " ' Couch it . ' An idiom ? " " An idiom . " " A very strange language . You speak Russian ? " " Not so you 'd notice . German , French , passable Italian , some Spanish , a smattering of a few others . " " Excellent . But , of course , your work demands it . " " Would you like to remove the makeup ? " " Soon . Where did you say the bathroom was ? " Knight pointed . Ten minutes later the Professor emerged smiling . " Where is that chess set ? " " The makeup ? " " One chess game first . I am the guest , yes ? " Knight shrugged and set up the chess men . An hour and twenty minutes after they had begun  --  interrupted only by Knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . " Stalemate . You play a strong game . " " I like to win at whatever I do . " " I , too . It is the only proper attitude . We will play again . " He  | gazed into the distance dreamily , then returned to the moment . " Now you can turn me back into Beshlenkov . " Knight moved him to the kitchen table , near a lamp . As before , the wig came off first . Knight lingered over brushing his hair , lost in thought . " Itchy ? " he finally asked . " A little . " " Only natural . " He continued brushing Beshlenkov 's hair . " You 're a good actor , Professor . " Beshlenkov appeared pleased . " Do you think so ? I 'll tell you a secret . There is something of the performer in every scientist . The world thinks of us puttering away in our laboratories , oblivious to celebrity . But there is as much jealousy and temperament and hunger for fame among scientists as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Almost nothing surprises me where people are concerned . " Beshlenkov threw back his head and laughed . Knight dialed his office , exchanged pleasantries with Marianne and waited for Ferguson to pick up . Beshlenkov thumbed idly through a world atlas . " Jim ! What took you so long ? " " Let 's scramble . " " Right ... okay . " A pause . " Did you pull it off ? " he asked . " We 're here and we 've already had a game of chess . " Knight exchanged glances with the Professor . " Our tall friend saved the day . " " Is he with you ? " " No , but I 'm expecting him . Anything from headquarters ? " " Only a mountain of telexes . The gist of them is , where the hell 's the merchandise ? Want me to send them the good news ? " " Not yet . " " Why ? " ? " I want to make sure everything 's secure at this end first . I 'll let you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knight hung up , Beshlenkov closed the book . " You recall my telling you that I always speak my mind ? " he said sternly . " Yes , Professor . " " Well , my friend , I 'm starving . Do n't you ever feed your guests ? " 121  | " We have a problem . Ive been moving so much , there 's no food to speak of on the premises . We ca n't very well have you strolling the streets of Munich looking like yourself and I 'm not about to leave you alone while I go shopping . So it 's either back into makeup or a cup of coffee and a stale roll until my partner arrives . " " The coffee , then . I do n't feel up to all that ugliness again . What a face you chose for me . " Over the food , Beshlenkov mellowed . With honest curiosity , he asked , " Has anyone ever told you how abominable your coffee is ? No matter . " He added sugar liberally and dipped an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes me back to my student days , except then it was strong tea and black bread . Those were wonderful days , studying , studying , studying . One could actually feel his brain growing , expanding in all directions , soaking up everything , questioning everything . " He tilted his head to bite into the roll . " It was thrilling to think that other young men like myself , in Prague , in Berlin , in London , in Rome , in Paris were studying the same things , perhaps asking some of the same questions at the very same moment . Which of us , I often wondered , would make names for themselves ? Who would solve the problems , unveil the mysteries , find the right keys to the thousand locks of nature ? I can not begin to tell you what secret vows I made to myself in the early hours of countless mornings while tears of fatigue streamed down my cheeks . " A sip of coffee etched disapproval on his face . He spooned more sugar into his cup and stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man .. . like Byron , except without all the lady friends . " " I have a feeling you 've more than made up for that particular lack over the years . " Beshlenkov 's eyes laughed . " You know about that ? But of course you must have done research on me . Ah , my dear Knight " ? he held up his half-eaten roll and solemnly regarded it ? " as I 'm sure you know , man does not live by bread alone . " Pedestrian arrived in the middle of their third chess game , looking fit and rested and very young . He shook hands with Knight and Beshlenkov . " So the wall worked , eh ? Beautiful ! " He turned a kitchen chair around and straddled it . " What happened to you ? " Knight asked . " I thought it best to make myself scarce , so I rode streetcars for  | a couple of hours and then beat it to the airport . I 've been staying with a friend only a few kilometers from here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day , checking to see if you 'd arrived yet . " He looked around . " Nice place . " " Young man , " Beshlenkov said . Pedestrian looked at him expectantly . " Allow me to thank you for the part you played in my rescue . I did not see everything , but what I saw of your efforts on my behalf was most impressive . " " Thank you , Professor . " " Slightly sensational , " Knight said . " Why did n't you tell me ? " Pedestrian blushed unexpectedly . " I did n't want to brag . " " It was an incredible performance , " Beshlenkov said . " Where did you learn this .. . this ... " ? he looked at Knight ? " savate ? " " From my father , who learned it from his and so on . " " And how long have you been practicing it ? " " Almost twenty years . " " You must have been a mere child when you began . " " A very thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I understand . What is your name ? " " Call me Pedestrian . Everyone does . " " Pedestrian ? Ah , of course  --  a pun . Marvelous ! " " You realize what this means , Professor , do n't you ? " Knight asked . " We can eat , yes ? " " Yes . " Knight beckoned Pedestrian toward the kitchen . " Let me make a list of what we need because I want to stay put . There 's a little grocery store around the corner , to the right as you leave the courtyard . " They were in the kitchen , out of Beshlenkov 's line of vision , as Knight opened and shut cupboard doors . " We 'll need some cold cuts ... mustard .. . bread . .. milk ... fruit ... " .. fruit ... " he intoned , pausing to write them down on a slip of paper . " Does n't seem offish at all , " Pedestrian said , nodding toward the Professor . " In fact , a nice , regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . cream ... a couple of tomatoes ... " Knight continued to write as he called out the items . He pointed to the last entry on his list . It read : " TOO BAD HE 'S A PHONY . " Pedestrian 's mouth fell open .  | It was not until after they had eaten and adjourned to the living room that Knight made his move . " There is a delicate matter that we must discuss now , Professor , " he began , " and I hope you wo n't be offended by anything I say . " Beshlenkov regarded his host with interest . " I owe you a great deal , my friend . What is it ? " He tapped a cigarette against his thumbnail with great deliberation and lit it . " You must understand my position in this . I 'm only an in- ' strument ? " " And a very effective one . " Knight acknowledged the compliment with a nod . Say what you would , this was a very cool , even charming man . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? an instrument of my government . Although I do n't really know what 's at stake here , this is probably the most important assignment of my career and I ca n't afford to make any mistakes . " " Of course not . I can assure you that I will personally commend you to your superiors for the superb way in which you have handled the entire affair . " " What I mean is that I must be absolutely positive that I have not already made one . " Pedestrian stood up and , moving about the apartment as if to stretch his legs , leaned casually against the wall , near the Professor . " I 'm afraid I do n't understand . " " It 's just this  --  and again , forgive me  --  it 's a stupid piece of business , but I must be sure that you are Professor Leon Fedorovich Beshlenkov . " " You are joking , of course . " The Professor looked up at Pedestrian , who was not smiling . He locked eyes with Knight . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I am ? " " Please understand . I am under orders from my government and those orders say , among other things , that I must be absolutely  | positive that I have the right man . You certainly look like Beshlenkov . You talk as I imagine Beshlenkov talks . And you behave like him . But can you prove you are Beshlenkov ? " " Can you prove you are James Knight ? " Beshlenkov mimicked . " That 's not the question . " " But it is . How can any man prove his identity in a strange country ? You saw me at the convention . Everyone there knew me . Could I fool hundreds of my colleagues ? " " You are a known recluse whose movements have been carefully guarded . Many people have not seen you for years . Would you tell me your mother 's first name ? " " Rebecca . " " And your birth date ? " " January twenty-fifth , 1918 . But these are facts anyone could learn , as you well know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're Jewish , are n't you ? " " I was born a Jew , but have not practiced my religion in years . " " But as a Jewish male , you were circumcised eight days after birth , is n't that so ? " " Naturally . " " And in 1918 few Russian gentiles practiced circumcision ? " " I suppose not . " " Are you circumcised ? " " I am . " " Would you kindly prove it ? " " What ? " The Professor crimsoned with indignation , stubbed out his cigarette and stood up , trembling . " This is outrageous ! How dare you ? " he demanded . " How dare you ? " Knight 's voice remained even . " And let me say now that it is not difficult to determine whether a circumcision is new or old . " " I-will-not-do-this ! " Beshlenkov swayed on his feet . " I 'm deeply sorry , Professor . But surely you can see how a refusal on your part can only lead to suspicion . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way to Washington . " Beshlenkov 's lips moved , but he said nothing audible . He peered into Knight 's eyes , searching for a glint of humor , saw none and turned to Pedestrian . " What do you have to say about this ? " he asked .  | " He 's in charge , " Pedestrian said . " I 'm only here to help . " " May I step into the bedroom for a moment ? " the Professor asked Knight . " I saw a bathrobe there . " " Of course . " Knight signaled Pedestrian to accompany him . As they filed toward the bedroom and Beshlenkov passed briefly out of earshot , Pedestrian shot a dubious glance at Knight and whispered , " Can you really tell the difference between circum-cisions ? " " Beats the hell out of me , " Knight whispered back . Moments later , his hands in the air , Pedestrian emerged from the bedroom . Beshlenkov followed , but the only change in his appearance was the 7.62 Tokarev that he now pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the couch and clasp your hands behind your heads , " he ordered . He sidestepped his way across the room , back against the wall , watching them with unblinking eyes . When they had settled on the couch , Pedestrian , looking straight ahead , muttered , " You were right . My apologies . " The man with the gun sat down opposite them . " Yes , you were right and I salute you . But where did I go wrong ? I thought my Beshlenkov was brilliant . " " It was , " Knight said , " but not perfect . " " Oh ? " " A few small details . " " Such as ? ? " " The very first words you spoke after the escape . They did n't bother me at first , but later , when I thought about them in the light of other developments , they did n't ring true . Do you remember what they were ? " " I do not . " " You did n't say Are we safe ? ' or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who had just undergone a terrifying ordeal . No  --  you congratulated me on a very effective operation . " Knight twisted uncomfortably in his seat . " Must we keep our hands up like this ? " " Yes . Please continue . I 'm always anxious to learn . " " What kind of person , I asked myself , would refer to an operation ' and admire its execution ? Another operative , clearly , probably a KGB agent . " " Very good . Viktor Zarubkin , formerly of the KGB , now retired ,  | currently reactivated . " He bowed his head without losing eye contact with Knight . " You have perhaps heard of me ? " " Ca n't say that I have . " " I worked with your people during the war . But that was before your time . You , of course , are the Rainbow Man , whom we 've heard so much about . For many years I was your Soviet counterpart , code name Chameleon . Incidentally , not only did I know Stanislayski ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second mistake . You knew exactly how to use the lifts I handed you and had no trouble walking on them . You inserted the nose piece like a pro . And all that talk about the theater . Tch-tch-tch . They all suggested an actor . So did your strong voice . I 'd work on that voice if I were you . " Zarubkin smiled . " Anything further ? " " When I put your wig on the first time , your bald spot was clean . On the following day , there was a slight growth , like beard stubble . The oversight must have occurred to you , too , because when we arrived here , you insisted on going to the bathroom before you would allow me to remove your makeup . You shaved the spot then because when I removed the wig , it was miraculously bald as a billiard ball again . " " An unforgivable blunder . " " There 's more . " " Please continue . " " You had the Professor 's mannerisms down pat  --  his interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair over our chess games , the fast eating , but you really blew it yesterday . " " How so ? " Zarubkin was clearly irritated . " Do you remember the very first thing I did upon entering the apartment ? " Zarubkin thought a moment . " You played a gramophone record . So ? " " It was the Jupiter Symphony . As a lover of Mozart , you should have commented on it . Beshlenkov would have . " Zarubkin rubbed his forehead . " You 're absolutely right . You have my total admiration . But there was so much to learn ! Beshlenkov was a great genius , with an incredible range of interests . I only had a few months ? " 127  | " Was ? " " He 's dead . " Knight felt a sudden hollowness balloon in his stomach . He glanced at Pedestrian . " When ? " " Mid-February . A senseless auto accident in Moscow last November . That he was kept alive at all is a miracle . There must have been twenty separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world were flown in and sworn to secrecy . He never regained consciousness . " Zarubkin stood up and kicked his legs . " Old men get stiff , " he explained . " Why this charade , then ? " Knight asked . " Ah-hah ! You want to know motivation ; I can appreciate that . There is no harm in telling you now . Fortunately , Beshlenkov 's work was almost done , whatever it was  --  and I do n't pretend to know any more about it than you do  --  but our people knew that your people were aware of it . What they needed most was time to complete the work based on the Professor 's notes , then test the finished product . When they discovered that Beshlenkov was ready to defect , they decided after his accident that they could buy additional time by making your people wait for the Vienna conference . " Carried away by his own narrative , Zarubkin had moved closer to the couch , and stood only feet away from the two men . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the United States would do nothing until this week . And it served to slow down your government 's own research on a similar project . Why bother if Beshlenkov himself would soon be available ? Luckily , I bear a more than passing resemblance to the late Professor ; only minor plastic surgery was necessary . Beshlenkov 's hermit ways helped the deception . When they approached me to come out of retirement for this final performance , I found the challenge irresistible  --  you will understand that . And there was an extra attraction to the operation : an opportunity to eliminate the two best American agents in Europe . Had our men in the ambulance succeeded , I would be home by now . " " And how did the tests go ? " " In the Soviet Union , on animals , very well . " " And on people ? " " That test is taking place this month in one of your cities . " He  | waved the Tokarev at Knight . " No , no  --  the hands behind the head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how ? Knight estimated the distance to Zarubkin  --  five feet , perhaps . It was impossible to get at him from a seated position before he pulled the trigger . Maybe if they both rushed him . Pedestrian must be thinking the same thing , but how could they coordinate an attack without com-municating ? Zarubkin 's eyes were riveted on Pedestrian . " I know what you 're thinking , my friend . A lunge ? A kick from a seated position ? Both very dangerous . True , I am no longer a young man , but it does not take much strength to squeeze a trigger and I am still an excellent marksman , I assure you . " For the first time in his life , Knight wished he were taller . A few more inches in the legs might do it . Very slowly , he slumped in his seat . Maybe .. . Zarubkin was becoming the victim of his own rhetoric , inching toward them . " Unfortunately  --  or perhaps fortunately  --  for you , we know that interrogating you would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be said . " He turned to Knight , who straightened up , and aimed the Tokarev at him . " Goodbye , Rainbow Man . Do n't feel bad ; you were to die in any event . " " Wait ! " Knight said . " What is it ? " " Just answer three questions . " Zarubkin nodded . " If I can . .. as a professional courtesy , " he added with a smile . " How did you get that pistol past airport inspection and cus-toms ? " " I did n't . That was your mistake , my friend . You recall the street musician ? One of our people . " Knight whistled . " Question number two ? " " Were your bodyguards in on the impersonation ? " " Those idiots ? " His voice dripped contempt . " No . They could never have acted their roles so convincingly if they had suspected that anything was amiss . They were guarding Beshlenkov ' to the best of their limited abilities . We were counting on your ingenuity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not envy them when they return to Moscow , even though the plan worked . Your last question ? " He was closer now , though not quite close enough . " Would a bribe interest you ? Something really king-size ? A million dollars in any currency you name , say ? " Not waiting for a reply , Knight slid down hard in the couch , at the same time kicking out at the pistol . Zarubkin held on to it and fired wildly into the ceiling as he staggered backward . It was a costly stagger . Before he could get off another round , Pedestrian was off the couch and the toe of his right shoe was connecting sharply with the underpart of Zarubkin 's nose . The Russian stood suddenly erect , pistol still in hand , shut his eyes , then collapsed to the floor like an empty sack . He did not stir . Knight knelt over him , uncurled his fingers and tossed the Tokarev onto the couch . " He 's dead , " Pedestrian said without emotion from across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Shit ! " Knight sat on the floor and hugged his knees . 130  | A dark green Mercury glided to a halt in front of a neatly manicured lawn ; its motor died , but the driver did not get out  --  he continued to sit with both hands on the wheel , staring at the rearview mirror . The street , like any in the suburbs at this time of morning , was deserted except for a squat mail truck making its rounds . As the truck lumbered around a corner and disappeared from sight , in the mirror he saw the familiar Buick approaching from behind . It pulled over just in back of him . He stepped out of his car , walked around it to the pavement and entered the Buick . The man in the hat sat in the driver 's seat . " Well ? " he said . " Zarubkin is dead . " Except for little lines of pain that appeared briefly in the corners of his eyes , the man in the hat remained impassive . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " How do you know ? " " One of our people was stationed in front of Rainbow 's apartment house . He saw the body removed in the middle of the night . " " Could he be mistaken ? " " It was Zarubkin . Rainbow and Pedestrian were seen later . " There was perspiration in the creases of the speaker 's palms . He waited , feeling a headache coming on . " Did Zarubkin talk ? " " We do n't know . " The man in the hat did not move . He blinked several times , then said very quietly : " I want to make something very clear , and I will say it only once . Are you listening ? " " Yes . " " I do n't care how you do it , " he began in the same even voice , then shouted as he smashed a fist down on the dashboard , " but get rid of Rainbow and Pedestrian ! Get rid of them both ! " The other man bumped his head on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's coming in , " Carl Barnes said , consulting a pocket-size notebook , " we 'll be ready to go by the twenty-fifth at  | the outside . Matter of fact , I 'd like each of you to take a few liters home next week . The lab fridge is getting crowded . " He sat hunched over in a leather chair near the fireplace , anticipating Durst 's pleasure . A log crackled , sending a Morse code of sparks flying as it settled in the grate . " You 're sure of the date ? " " Absolutely , Frank . It 's simple arithmetic , and a double shipment just arrived . " " Is that safe ? " Dr. Glover asked . " Except for the Anderson broad , I 'm the biology department , and she does n't seem to notice or care . I think she 's being serviced by some stud from Tremont , which is a lucky break for us . " Miles Trumbull guffawed . " Louella Anderson ? That cow 's got herself a boyfriend ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she is. , , " Gawd ! " Trumbull chuckled . " I guess it 's better than dipping it into a can of oil  --  but not much ! " He slapped the arm of his chair . Carl Barnes and the doctor joined in the laughter . " All right , " Durst said , " the Anderson woman has a lover and presents no danger . May we proceed ? " He turned to Dr. Glover , who immediately grew sober . " Have we identified all the families ? " Glover nodded . " Four hundred and twelve of them , all steady customers of Miles ' . " " Very well . Let 's shoot for the twenty-fifth . " He raised inquiring eyebrows at Trumbull . " Everything set at the dairy ? " Trumbull nodded . " Yep . Come D-day , Carl and I will be handling the Zeta at the bottling plant . It 's a go , Frank . " Durst stared into space , as if unreeling a familiar movie in his mind , then stood up and reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four glasses of Scotch , dropping two ice cubes into one of them . " On the rocks if I remember correctly , Doctor ? " Glover winked and accepted the drink , along with the others . " One reminder , " Durst said . " Except for Miles , and the doctor 's necessary visits to the hospital , no one leaves Dalton . Understood ? " He looked about , saw no disagreement and broke into an uncharacteristic smile , which soon faded . He raised his glass as  | the rest shuffled to their feet . " Gentlemen , " he said , " I give you Operation Crucible . " " Operation Crucible , " they intoned . The Director pushed a pile of papers aside and , from behind his surprisingly messy desk , decorated with the memorabilia of three wars and six administrations , assessed Harcourt . " You look .. . distraught . " " Bad news , I 'm afraid . " Waved to a chair , he sat ramrod stiff across the desk from his superior , hands in lap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttoned . " What is it ? " " The Beshlenkov affair ... we 've failed . Not only that , but Beshlenkov is dead . " For the first time in the twenty-six years they had worked together , Harcourt extracted a marked reaction from the Director . The granite face went ashen . " Tell me about it . Do not omit a single detail . " Twenty minutes later he looked across the desk . " Is that all of it ? " " Yes , sir . Let me say now that Rainbow is , beyond argument , our finest agent , and Pedestrian is not far behind , considering his age . I consider them faultless in the entire affair . " The Director waved his hand , as if chasing away a bothersome insect . " Yes , yes , of course . " He thought a moment , then murmured , " An experiment in an American city . That 's it , then ; they have Zeta and I have no doubt that it will be a success . " He leaned forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My God , Harcourt . My God ! We 're years behind them on this . " Harcourt waited a respectable length of time before raising the question that represented the real purpose of his visit . " Rainbow wants to try to locate the city , with Pedestrian 's help . It 's a needle in a haystack , but I see no alternative . " " Do you have any idea how many cities there are ? " the Director asked grimly . " If I understand you correctly , the experiment may already be in progress . Is n't that so ? " " True . But we do n't know how accurate Zarubkin 's information was . We do n't tell our own people very much . He may have been 135  | boasting . It could even be a false alarm , a plant . " Harcourt removed his glasses , plucked a handkerchief from his breast pocket and polished them . " I say it 's worth a try . " " Where would we start ? It could be Anchorage or Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off impotently . " It 's worth a try . " The Director pinched the bridge of his nose . " Of course it is . Very well . All our resources are at your disposal , needless to say . Whatever you or this Rainbow thinks is necessary , you have but to ask for it . I 'll inform the President . " He swiveled his chair around to a window view of the city , opalescent in the late afternoon sunshine . It occurred to him that Washington itself could very well be the target city . Without turning , , he said , " Thank you , Harcourt . Thank you very much . " Ferguson showed Knight and Pedestrian the telex that had come during the night : YOUR BUSINESS VENTURE APPROVED BY CHAIRMAN OF BOARD . AMSTERDAM BRANCH MANAGER TO ACCOMPANY . REPORT TO HOME OFFICE SOONEST WITH LIST OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NEEDED . SKY 'S THE LIMIT . COMPANY COUNTING ON YOU . HARCOURT . " Marianne , " Knight said , " get us two tickets to Washington on the evening flight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , " Pedestrian said . " You ? " Ferguson sniffed . " It 's almost six for me . But I do n't envy you boys your job . How the hell do you expect to find the right city , Jim ? " " I do n't know , Fergy . But there must be a way . We ca n't just let it happen . " " It could n't be a very large city , " Pedestrian mused . " An experiment has to be observed , monitored , controlled . You ca n't do that in a metropolis of a million or even a couple of hundred thousand . My money 's on a smaller place . " " Makes sense , " Knight said , " unless there 's a way to isolate a section of a city . " He frowned . " The trouble is , we 're working in the dark . Not only do n't we know where the experiment is taking place ; we do n't even know what we 're talking about . It could be a gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Washington will have to open the kimono on this one , " Pedestrian said . Marianne hung up the telephone . " Your tickets will be waiting for you at the Lufthansa desk , Flight Two thirty-two , leaving at twenty-one thirty hours . " " You boys will have to excuse me now . I have a report to write . " " Shall I type it for you ? " Marianne asked . " I have to compose this one as I go along . " He walked past her to a desk in a far corner of the room and rolled a piece of blank paper into an electric typewriter . While he pecked away at the typewriter and Marianne caught up on some filing , Pedestrian and Ferguson exchanged views on the problem . ' " Maybe , " Ferguson said in a low voice , " it 's something they spray on food  --  on corn or wheat while it 's growing . " " There 'd be no way to isolate the people who eventually eat it . " " Something dumped into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . " " Same problem . Never mind what it is . Let 's figure out where . " " I 've got it ! It is a big city . Everybody starts getting sick or dropping dead , you could panic the entire country . " " I do n't think so . It 's an experiment , something on a small scale . If it works , then they go for a big city , or a state . " Ferguson talked to himself : " A small town .. . the Midwest ... the South ... the Southwest . " His face lit up . " I know ? an island somewhere . Hawaii ? " " One of the smaller cities , off the beaten track . Could be . " Ferguson 's voice grew lower still . " It 's hopeless , is n't it ? " Pedestrian looked across the room at Knight , who sat hunched over the typewriter . He turned to Ferguson and whispered , " Yes . " " That 's what I thought . " " The only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is occurring this month . We can prepare to isolate the town as soon as the casualties are reported and do whatever is necessary to protect the rest of the country , but I do n't see us getting there in time . " He perched on the corner of Ferguson 's desk , one foot dangling , and lit a cigarette . " I would n't want to be a general in the National Guard when it happens . "  | " Fergy ! " " Yeah , Jim ? " " Go to my file and dig out the first telex Harcourt sent us . Second drawer from the top . Catch ! " He tossed a ring of keys which Ferguson plucked out of the air . Ferguson fumbled with the keys , searching for one with a number corresponding to that of the cabinet lock . He finally found it , inserted it and released the drawer . When he pulled it open , he only had time to realize that the files were gone and in their place lay a mechanism of some sort before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hair , bone and flesh separated , burned , splattered over the floor and ceiling . Hurled across the room , his body slammed against his desk with hurricane force , carrying it halfway through the wall . Pedestrian stumbled across the room , colliding with Marianne 's desk , which was hurtling toward him like an express train , finally pinning him to the wall just above the knees . The girl , who had been holding on to another file drawer , fell backward with it still in her hand , screaming as shards of glass sliced her face , arms and torso . Knight wondered why the typewriter was suddenly in his lap . Then , flung sideways out of his chair , he violently butted the wall and slumped to the floor . In the street below , people who had initially scattered to avoid the shower of glass and bricks had regrouped and stood staring upward at the smoke billowing from the windows and gaping holes in one side of the building . Twisted steel beams and pipes curling grotesquely into nothingness against the sky protruded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West German subsidiary of Global Venture Capital , Inc . A doctor , crisply professional looking , stood at the window adjusting the blinds . The light slanted sinuously across the bed , following every curve of the gray blanket . The walls were light green and the room , very quiet . Knight blinked and ran his hands over his face . He winced when he touched the side of his head . " How do you feel ? " the doctor asked . " Shaky . What happened ? " " There was an explosion in your office . You 're a very lucky man . Aside from that large bump over your left ear , we can find nothing . "  | " How are the others ? " He felt exhausted . " The girl is severely lacerated and has lost a great deal of blood . She may require plastic surgery . We 'll know more in a few days . " " And the men ? " " The tall man 's legs are broken and he sustained some minor facial burns as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ . " The other man ? " The doctor did not reply . " How 's the other man ? " He raised himself with difficulty , gazing steadily at the doctor , who seemed to be growing dark and wavy . " I 'm sorry to say he 's dead . " He watched Knight 's face . " Fergy ... dead ? " " Apparently he was closest to the blast . Death was instantaneous . " The doctor 's voice echoed , as if he were talking from the bottom of a well . " Dead ? " Knight heard himself ask . He had never felt so tired in his life ; he slid down in bed again . " I 've given you a rather strong sedative , Mr. Knight . You will feel better in the morning . " Dead ? The doctor dissolved in front of his eyes . Although his legs were encased in hip-high casts and face was partially bandaged , Pedestrian was sitting up in bed , reading and smoking . The magazine fell from his hands when he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard about Ferguson , " He said . " I 'm awfully sorry . " " They 'll pay ; I promise . " " What now ? " " No choice . I go to Washington alone . " " When ? " " Tomorrow , or the day after . " " You look fit . " " Seems I got away cheap . " " Sorry I ca n't go with you . How 's the girl ? " " I just saw her . She 's all bandaged up and under sedation , but they 're hopeful . Do what you can for her when she comes around , will you ? " 139  | " Of course . " " Need anything ? " " Nothing . " " Want me to contact anyone back home ? " " I do n't think so . I 'll write some lies to my mother . I 'm very good at that . " Knight offered his hand . " I wish we could go on together . " " Perhaps our paths will cross again ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The doctor says I 'm okay and there does n't seem to be anything I can do for you or Marianne . " " A question ? " " Shoot . " " If you 're all right , why are n't you leaving for Washington imme-diately ? " " I told you . I have a score to settle . " " I see . " He did not think it politic to remind Knight of his duty directly . Instead , he said , " For what it 's worth , I think it 's a small town off the beaten track somewhere . New England , maybe , or the Midwest . " " We 'll find it . " " I hope so . Well , good luck and , Rainbow ? ? " " Yeah ? " " Be careful . They 're after you , you know . You were supposed to open that filing cabinet . " " I know . " " Do n't go back to your apartment , either . They 'll be waiting . " " I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main post office . The first was to the American Embassy in Bonn . After identifying himself to an aide , he was put through to an embassy attache , who listened largely in silence , interrupting once only to say , " As soon as you hang up . " When the line was free , the attache made one local call . Minutes later the telephone lines from Bonn to Munich hummed . Before noon , the Munich police and fire departments issued a joint statement that described the strange explosion at the office of Global  | Venture Capital as a freak accident due to a malfunctioning heating system ; certainly , it had nothing to do with anti-American terrorists , as several newspapers had conjectured . That afternoon , all surviving GVC documents were delivered under lock and key to the American consul in Munich , and all files on the case mysteriously disappeared . Knight 's second call was of a more personal nature . The wheezing voice at the other end of the line broke into friendly concern . " I just heard about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor Mr. Ferguson . Such a fine gentleman . " " It was murder , Hartmut , and I want your help . " " What can I possibly do , Mr. Knight ? " " I 'll tell you when I see you . I 'm coming over . " " When ? " " Right now . " " You are welcome , of course , but I fail to see ? " Knight had already hung up . Scharf was waiting for him at his studio . As soon as he opened the door to let Knight in , he flipped a sign hanging on it so that the " CLOSED " side faced the street . " Back here , Mr. Knight . " He turned sideways to negotiate the space between a counter and the wall , pushed aside a curtain and closed it once Knight was in the cozy apartment where Scharf lived alone . " A beer ? " he asked rhetorically , emptying two bottles into matching steins until the foam skittered down their sides . " I was greatly saddened by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who planted that bomb , Hartmut . " He took a long sip of beer , never taking his eyes off the obese man across the table . Scharf screwed up his face until it resembled a pile of unpressed laundry . " How would I know ? " Knight pushed the stein away . " I do n't have time for games . I know who you are , and I think you know who I am . " " Mr. Knight ... Mr. Knight , " he protested , " I am a photographer ; you are a businessman . Need we know more than that about each other ? " " I 'm serious about this . A bank job is n't planned in this town that you do n't know about ; a kilo of heroin does n't change hands without your say-so ? " 141
