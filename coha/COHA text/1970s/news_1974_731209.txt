txt THE UNITED STATES Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD announced yesterday that it plans to sell 200 federally owned singlefamily homes to the City of Chicago for $1 aniece . They are houses which buyers obtained with the help of a Federal Housing Administration FHA subsidy . The buyers either abandoned the houses or defaulted on their mortgage payments . Robert Horn , an assistant to H. R. Crawford , assistant HUD secretary for property management , said the city will be able to do what it wants with the houses . IT COULD , for example , turn the houses over to the Chicago Housing Authority for lowincome families in need of public housing , he said . Another possibility is that ' the city could start an experimental " urban homesteading " plan . Under an " urban homesteading " plan , the city would turn the houses over , probably for $1 each , to persons who agree to rehabilitate them and live in them for a specified period of time , City officials were not immediately available for comment . The Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is eager to take over federally owned homes ' here for public housing . HORN SAID , however , that CHA 's plan would have to be cleared first with Judge Richard H. Austin of Federal District ' Court , who ordered the CHA in 1969 to provide its next 700 public housing units in white neighborhoods . The overwhelming majority of federally respossessed homes in the city are in predominantly black communities . Horn said the 200 homes to be sold to the city would be selected ' by the Chicago area office of HUD from an inventory of 2,500 single-fiimly homes HUD now holds in Chicago . Those selected , he said , will be units that HUD deems too , expensive for the federal government to rehabilitiate and resell on the private market . The units selected will be structurally sound , he said . HORN SAID HUD plans to sell 4,000 federally owned houses to communities across the country .
