NATHANROSALYN UDOWELEANOR CI Letters Unhelpful ' Support Newfound ' Brutality ' in Iran For Israeli Policies To the Editor : For 25 years the Shah of Iran tortured and murdered many thousands of dissident workers , students , peasants and intellectuals . For the most part , the U.S. press ignored these dreadful happenings and portrayed the Shah as a citadel of stability and an enlightened modernizer . Thousands more were killed by the Shah 's police and military during the popular uprisings of this past year . Yet these casualties received only passing mention , even though Iran was front-page news for several months . And from 1953 to 1978 millions of other Iranians suffered the silent oppression of poverty and malnutrition while the Shah , his family and his generals grew ever richer . Now the furies of revolution have lashed back , thus far executing about 200 of the Shah 's henchmen ? less than what the Savak would arrest and torture on a slow weekend . And now the U.S. press has suddenly become acutely concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printing photos of firing squards and making repeated references to the " revulsion " and " outrage " felt by anonymous To the Editor : In the editorial " Out on a Limb " ( April 26 ) , The Times proves once again that its eye , too , is on the sparrow . But in this case the eye is glass . // " middle-class " Iranians who apparently are endowed with finer sensibilities than the mass of ordinary people who bore the brunt of the Shah 's repression . At the same time , American commentators are quick to observe that the new regime is merely replacing the one repression with another . So it has always been with the recording of revolutions : the mass of nameless innocents victimized by the ancien regime go uncounted and unnoticed , but when the not-so-innocent murderers are brought to revolutionary justice , the business-owned press is suddenly filled with references to " brutality " and " cruelty . " That anyone could equate the horrors of the Shah 's regime with the ferment , change and struggle that is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. press , a press that has learned to treat the atrocities of U.S.-supported right-wing regimes with benign neglect while casting a stern , selfrighteous eye on the popular revolutions that challenge such regimes . MICHAEL PARENT ! Visiting Fellow , Institute for Policy Studies Washington , May 8 , 1979 pitched and shingled roof and a hinged door . It was built by carpenters according to plans , not by small boys doing a Tom Sawyer bit . Moreover , it contains full-sized furniture , including several chairs , a table and bedding for four people . But this structure was not ? as you state ? condemned because it is presumably dangerous to children but because it is an illegal structure in terms of what it is , where it is , how big it is and what it does to the neighborhood . It is visible from within the house as well as from the grounds of numerous neighbors ? all of whom have children of their own and all of whom object to the structure as an eyesore . It bears about the same relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DON FRIFIELD Ridgefield , N.J. , May 1 , 1979 To the Editor : Bernice Tannenbaum 's outrage against the P.L.O . ( letter April 29 ) is understandable . Who among us was not moved when reading an account of a father and his little girl being murdered in cold blood ? But surely Bernice Tannenbaum must know that Israel , in its repeated retaliations , has killed many a father and daughter . If she does n't know this , it is the fault of the media , as well as her imagination . The results of P.L.O . terrorism are individuated for us by dramatic firsthand accounts on the front pages of our newspapers , whereas the casualties due to Israeli bombs and shells are merely statistics . Then why , one might ask , does the P.L.O . continue its attacks ? The answer to this question is ignored by too many Jews . It is because the war between the Palestinians and the Israelis has never ended . Even after the signing of a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt , the fate of the Palestinians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past three decades . In all fairness ? and I do not ask this question easily ? why should they lay down their arms ? When the British shoe was on the other Israeli foot , did Israel ? I suggest that at this point in its history , Israel is incapable of responding to peace with the same magnificent daring and imagination with which it responds to war and other crisis . I suggest that it is precisely here that the almost Pavlovian allegiance on the part of American Jewish organizations ( of which Hadassah is one ) ? the kind of unquestioning endorsement these organizations have accorded Israel in its policies ? has been most unhelpful . All they have succeeded in accomplishing so far has been the reinforcement of the hawks and the self-righteous at the expense of the doves and the peacemakers . Perhaps if Bernice Tannenbaum brought this to the attention of her organization , she would do more to alleviate the suffering of innocent Israeli victims than by issuing propaganda pleas . DAVID GOLDMAN New York , April 30 , 1979 Beef and Confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G race The " tree house " you cite is not even a tree house at all , if you define a tree house as a house built in a tree , generally on a platform nestling among the branches . The structure in question is , in fact , a cabin on eight-foot stilts set within the ground . It rises another eight feet above the platform , which measures 8 x 12 feet . The building itself is approximately 750 cubic feet . It consists of a porch , four windows , a skylight , a Hospital Quandary To the Editor : Messrs . Lynaugh and Goldner are right on target in their April 26 letter , noting that the Federal Government reaps the lion 's share of any cost savings the city or state governments are able to achieve through hospital cost reimbursement strategies . In a report for the Temporary Commission on City Finances , I estimated that the closure of 5,000 hospital beds , half in municipal and half in voluntary hospitals , would save $234 million a year . However , the city would realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present Medicaid reimbursement formulas , to the Federal and state governments . Unless these governments offer the city a more favorable arrangement , the political and social price of bed closings may be too great for the city to pay . RICHARD W. NATHAN Los Angeles , May 3 , 1979 To the Editor : According to a news report , a spokesman for the aides to the City councilmen stated that they are going to lobby their employers for an increase in the allocation for the group from the present $20,000 annually for each councilman to $35,000 . This has to win the " Chutzpah of the Year " award . If enacted , it would cost the taxpayers an additional $645,000 a year . At a time in our city 's history when next year 's proposed budget calls for so many cuts in essential services , how can anyone seriously ask for an increase for what is probably the most nonessential group on the city 's payroll , the City Council aides ? Just-three or four years ago their total budget was $7,500 per council member . Unnoticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , again without fanfare , increased to $20,000 . What is a council aide ? What do they do , and how are they appointed ? As a former Democratic district leader in the 84th Assembly District I can tell you first-hand . Although I am sure that some councilmen do use their aides exclusively for council business , most are " noshow " or " seldom show " appointments to party workers as a reward for their services . These are part-time jobs , but most aides are paid at least the necessary minimum required to make them eligible to receive all of the To the Editor : Your editorial on April 26 , " Out on a Limb , " was very good . I 'm with your stand all the way . I 'm also very glad that you put in something worthwhile for a child to read . A tree house is a child 's toy and should n't be taken away . You were right about everything in your editorial . I do n't think that you really need a nermit to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 , 1979 Fairness in Education To the Editor : Timothy Mitchell 's April 25 letter misinterprets the Levittown court decision . The court , in effect , ruled that lack of local tax wealth should not deprive children in poor school districts of the same educational opportunities as children in wealthier districts . The same principle of fairness applies to the constitutional right to an abortion . Had the courts ruled as Mr. Mitchell suggests , people without children would be exempt from that part of the real estate tax that goes to schools , and people who do n't use libraries , parks , public transportation and other municipal facilities would be exempt frnm taYPs that subsidize them .

They are expected to work for the political clubs and their candidates prior to primary and general elections , and many are recruited for duty at the Board of Elections when there are petition challenges . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private legal work for their councilman , if he happens to be a lawyer . Last year , after unsuccessfully attempting to raise their own salaries , the City councilmen voted to increase their expense allowance by a whopping $11,500 per member . However , it was stipulated that none of this money could be used for their aides . Each year the cost of running the City Council seems to increase one way or another . This latest attempt to fleece the public once again is an abomination . ELEANOR CHAIFETZ Bronx , April 30 , 1979 To the Editor : Your April 19 editorial " Keep the Beef Boycott Within Bounds " made an impressive and important point . Your clear , perceptive explanation of such an extremely complex agricultural issue as beef prices and the cattle cycle was a valuable service to both . cattle producers and consumers . U.S. cattlemen now appear to be holding a large number of female cattle on their farms and ranches . If cattlemen remain confident that prices will remain profitable , many of these animals will probably go into breeding herds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If confidence falters , however , many of these heifers could go directly to market or into feedlots , delaying herd rebuilding and prolonging the period of tight beef supplies and high consumer prices . BOB BERGLAND Secretary of Agriculture Washington , April 26 , 1979 Soviet SALT Hurdle To the Editor : The key word in the SALT negotiations is " equality . " Since there are many different weapons systems , they are complicated to equate . But the fact remains that after decades of superiority we are settling for equality . Equality , except for one absolutely vital matter , namely verification . If there is to be equality in all other matters , why not in verification ? In one fell swoop , the Soviets could assure Senate passage of the treaty , have all the d  --  tente they want and swing world opinion . All they have to do is to permit inspection ? inspection equal to what we permit them . I do not call for inspection of anything but matters covered by treaty commitments . They can inspect and verify us ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why else would the men in the Kremlin deny us the same verification rights that we give them , why else than that they plan to cheat ? WILLIAM T. RHAME San Antonio , April 26 , 1979 View From the Subway To the Editor : " Subway Grime Yielding to Paint " says the headline ? bravo ! But what good is a glowing station name if you can not see it ? The windows of the cars are still grimy and virtually opaque . Or worse ? painted over by vandals . When is the city finally going to damn down on this disgrace ? H.
