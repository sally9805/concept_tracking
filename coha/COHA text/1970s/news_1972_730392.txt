txt j Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy yesterday endorsed the Knapp Commission 's recommendation that Governor Rockefeller appoint a special deputy attorney general to prosecute official corruption , while the city 's five District . Attorneys met with the Governor 's counsel to oppose it . The five District Attorneys met for an hour and 40 minutes with Michael Whiteman , counsel to the Governor , and marshaled their arguments against the suggestion that a citywide prosecutor was needed to investigate corruption among the police , prosecutors and judges . Ronald Maiorana , the Governor 's press secretary , said Mr. Whiteman , having conferred last week with Whitman Knapp , the lawyer who led the initial inquiry into police corruption , would report the views of " both sides " to the Governor . Mr. Whiteman asked the District Attorneys to submit records of indictments , convictions and current investigations in the area of official corruption . But Mr. Maiorana gave no indication of the thinking of the Governor on the matter . Mr. Rockefeller returned early yesterday from a trip to Israel , ' " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to become ' more deeply concerned with the problem or stamping out crime , " Mr. Murphy said at a news conference in the 20th Precinct police station at 120 West 82d Street . " Anything that the state can do would be a great help . " Mr. Murphy also said that he accepted Mr. Knapp 's explanation for deleting the special-prosecutor recommendation from the copy of the commission report given to the Police Commissioner before it was made public . Mr. Knapp said he did not want to embroil Mr. Murphy in the controversy surrounding the recommendation . Attack by 5 Prosecutors After their meeting with Mr. Whiteman at the Governor 's city office at 22 West 55th Street , the five District Attorneys  --  Prank S. Hogan , Burton B. Roberts of the Bronx , Eugene Gold of Brooklyn , Thomas J. Mackell of Queens and John M. Braisted Jr . of Staten Island ? gathered at a news conference to attack once again the commission 's finding that their close working relationships with the police inhibited corruption investigations . " We pointed out , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that the Knapp Commission made no investigation of the District Attorneys ' offices , there ' were no accusations of dereliction as far as we were concerned , there were no findings of any kind . " Mr. Hogan said that he and his colleagues were " extremely confident " that the corruptionfighting records they would submit " will demonstrate that ' there 's been no reluctance , that there 's been zealousness on our part long before the Knapp Commission came into existence , during the Knapp Commission and after the Knapp Commission has concluded its labors . " Staff ' Morale ' at Issue Mr. Hogan said that while the District Attorneys were not " on the defensive , " they were worried about " the lowering of morale " on their staffs . " The implications are  --  traditionally , historically ? that when a District Attorney is superseded , there is something wrong with his operation , " he said . " I do n't think you or the Governor would want to supersede a public official on an assumption . " Michael F. Armstrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the group did not recommend " superseding " the District Attorneys ; rather , he said , it suggested " supplementing " their already overtaxed staffs . " One would think they would welcome some help in this area , " he said . The tone of the District Attorneys ' news conference altered markedly when Mr. Mackell accused both the Knapp Commission and the Slate Commission of Investigation of using a ' ' McCarthy-type approach " and capitalizing on " the adverse publicity on my office in the past rew weeks . Official Pressure Charged Among other allegations , he was referring to an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the construction of his house , another investigation of the involvement of nine members of his staff in an alleged get-rich-quick scheme and the indictment of an assistant district attorney in his office on bribery charges . Citing the deletion or the recommendation from Mr. Murphy 's copy of the report , Mr Mackell charged that the Knapp Commission had inserted the special-prosecutor suggestion at the " last minute " to fuel the controversies touching the District Attorney 's ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Commission of Investigation had released its report , which bears the date " April , 1972 , " over the weekend to focus attention on his office . The report criticized a senior assistant district attorney in Mr. Mackell 's office for his handling of the case of a detective indicted on charges of plotting to sell heroin . Paul J. Curran , chairman of the state commission , heatedly denied Mr. Mackell 's charge and said the panel 's annual report , which traditionally bears an April date , was returned from the printer only last Tuesday . Mr. Armstrong also denied that the special-prosecutor recommendation was a lastminute entry aimed at Mr. Mackell 's office . " The need for an outside agency was apparent to the commissioners for many months , " he said . The only question was what form it should take . " Staff recommendations , including that of a deputy attorney general , were discussed as early as January , 1972 . The recommendation in its final form was agreed upon in midJuly.
