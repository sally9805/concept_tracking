Come on . It 'll be fun . ( Tom exits to find Lauretta ) PETCH Massey Hall , Cyclone Jack 's wedding party held at Massey Hall . ( Lauretta and Tom enter in as much of a procession as can be arranged ) MARACLE There must be a thousand people here . SHIPMAN Sure there are . Well , thanks for coming . ( There follows a hymn of praise ) Oh we admire him greatly He 's bigger than the Alps He went to Boston lately And took a hundred scalps O make his bonnet regal With feathers in a flock He 's swifter than the eagle Or far-flung tomahawk Oh let the brass band thunder And fill his heart with wonder And all his nation under The startled April dome ! On Onondaga swifter than the swan Onondaga Onondaga Onondaga on ! His steady eye was glistening As he went fleeting by And his great heart was listening For one great battle cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an injun horse and woolly And he 's hard to curry comb Ye house-tops put your flags on Folks get your good glad-rags on But do n't put juicy jags on To welcome Longboat home . They call the deer a racer I 'd put it out of breath The she-wolf , I 'd outspace her And hound her down to death Back from the far off war-path I many blankets bring My feet have trod the star-path My moccasins have wings Let hill and plain and valley With all your people rally To cheer your dusky ally Back to his native loam . ( This song should be staged as exuberantly as the original wedding reception when tumbling acts and female impersonators entertained . When the song is over , Tom finds himself alone on the stage . There is a reprise of two verses from the song " Cyclone Jack " . ) Tom was finished running Just plain finished as well We could n't celebrate A has-been at twenty-eight Not much there we could sell Tom was finished running Just plain finished as well No wanted a loser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We let him drive A big Toronto garbage truck Just one place for a loser Working on a garbage truck . ( END OF PLAY. )
