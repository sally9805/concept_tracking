ON the walls of SHAPE headquarters near Brussels , battle maps pinpoint the location of the 1,000,000 troops of the seven-nation Warsaw Pact , as well as the 4,200 Soviet tactical and medium-range nuclear weapons pointed at the heart of Western Europe . On the walls of the Warsaw Pact Command Headquarters in Moscow , other maps pinpoint the location of NATO 'S 580,000 troops , as well as its 7,000 nuclear weapons . <P> No one , except perhaps a few of the rival generals , seriously expects that those weapons will ever be fired or those troops committed to battle . In fact , most Europeans regard the paperkrieg as a bit of a charade . <P> That situation has created what may well be NATO 'S chief problem : how to maintain its strength and raison d ' tre in an age of dtente . Inevitably , the quality of NATO 's components has begun to waver more erratically than ever . The Italian army is moderately well trained , and could probably defend its own country against attack as long as the U.S. Sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast , may be the weakest of NATO 's major links . <P> West Germany 's Bundeswehr , descendant of the once mighty Wehrmacht , is filled with slovenly , long-haired draftees on 15-month hitches . As for the U.S. Seventh Army , it has been more conspicuous during the past two years for its racial battles in Frankfurt than its prowess in maneuvers . Britain 's volunteer Army of the Rhine , on the other hand , is the best field force in Western Europe . But with only 50,000 men it is too small to defend Germany 's vast northern plain on its own . <P> From Moscow , however , the forces of NATO appear somewhat more formidable . The Russians are aware that their own army is composed of conscripts who spend only 18 months of their two-year service on active duty . They also have good reason to be skeptical about the strength and dependability of Eastern Europe 's armies . Part of Hungary 's 100,000-man army fought the Russians in 1956 . On the other hand , not a shot was fired by Czechoslovakia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would the Czechoslovaks fire at anybody else ? The Bulgarian army ( 150,000 troops ) and the 125,000 East Germans under arms are more dependable , but Poland 's 275,000 troops probably could not be counted upon to do anything except defend their own borders . <P> Thus detente may be a blessing for the people of Europe , but it has hardly made the life of a military commander in either NATO or the Warsaw Pact any easier . How , for example , can a Soviet field marshal argue convincingly about the threat of war with Western Europe when the Trade Ministry down the street is selling oil , magnesium and titanium to the West ?
