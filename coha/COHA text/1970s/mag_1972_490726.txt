THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AFINE , freezing February night . Filthy wind . Filthy cold . The sidewalks are made of iron . Why are we out on the sidewalk , in the filthy wind and filthy cold , and with our hands burrowing like mice into our overcoat because we are too mature to wear mittens ? Answer : We are going to the movies . Answer : We are trailing about on the iron sidewalks of this frozen city like all the other foolish people who do n't have the sense to stay in at home and have a nice dinner , and maybe a bit of the brother-in-law 's brandy , and maybe a bleary look at the old TV , and so on . Answer : Because Miranda says she is not " into " making dinner , or , apparently , " into " a guzzle of brandy , or " into " a little sprawl on the floor , and certainly not " into " a look at the old TV . Come , 0 my brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us galoshy ourselves nver to thirdavenue and catch us a reel or two of the old horrorshow . We stand in front of the ticket window clutching two weeks ' salary in frozen hands , plus little Derek 's Series E Savings Bond , a gift from his only grandmother . The Madonna of the Tickets gazes out at us impassively . Behind , two ushers , dressed in uniforms of the Austrian hussars , are advancing upon Miranda . The Madonna of the Tickets laughs at the Series E Savings Bond and hands it back . Miranda is defending herself with wild judo swings and half-learned karate chops . The Madonna is making change . She smiles . One of the ushers has Miranda b the leg . Miranda falls . The two ushers take her , drag her toward the door . The Madonna hands forward the two tickets . Miranda , outside , is getting up off the sidewalk . " There is no waiting inside , " the ushers murmur in a dreamy singsong . " But there is nobody else here , " we say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no waiting inside , " they sing . We join Miranda on the frozen iron sidewalk . " It was n't too bad , " she says . " ' What color tickets ? " She looks at them . Pink . " Thank God , " she says . " I do n't much like the black . " We stand together outside on the sidewalk . One hour seems to go by . Maybe several hours . About a dozen people are in the line with us . It begins to snow . The ushers have become quite savage . Most new arrivals to the line are now bleeding a little . Other theatres nearby disgorge . " Look ! Leon ! " says Miranda . We see Leon walking slowly down the sidewalk , carrying his overcoat despite the cold , his face expressionless . We greet him quietly , wary of the ushers . " How was it , Leon ? " Leon smiles a small smile . " Was it the cowboy torture show ? " Miranda asks . " Or fire-department burnings and whippings ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a musical-comedy gang rape , although last month we stood in line four days for " Salacious Sauna . " Leon puts on his overcoat slowly . " It was one of the old ones , " he says . " A police thing . The old flat screen . They had music coming out of somewhere . " " Police ? " Miranda says . " What did they do to them ? The old stomping and gouging ? Setting the uniforms on fire ? " Leon shrugs . " It was very crude , " he says . " Besides , it was the police who did the things . Mostly , it was hitting . " " Hitting ? " Miranda says . A few feet away from us , a tall black man is swinging wildly at the ushers . One of them , the shorter one , comes in under the swing and hits him with what seems to be a chain . " You mean , " Miranda says , " they just hit them ? Like that ? " The black man and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess so , " says Leon . " There was something there with a small knife , but mostly it was hitting . " Our line begins to move . Leon waves goodbye and disappears in the direction of the porno-poster shop . Inside the lounge , it is warm . A tall , beautiful girl pours coffee into cups . Several old people sleep , leaning against each other . On one of the couches , four or six people are making love . There is the sound of a fight somewhere upstairs in the theatre . We walk upstairs . The title of the movie appears on the large screen . " Swallow 's Flight . " " It does n't sound like cowboy torture , " Miranda says . " Not cowboy torture , " says an impatient voice from behind . " Beachboy torture , and then surf rape . " The screen suddenly explodes into color . Movement . The sound of a sitar comes from somewhere in the soft carpet . Waves are rolling upon a beach . A girl sings . A man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it the sitar ? The sitar plays softly somewhere underneath the soft carpet . A girl is being raped by several men . Miranda grasps a hand . " They cribbed that from Pettigrew , " she says . " Pettigrew is the cameraman on ' Swallow 's Flight , ' " the voice behind us says , impatiently . " Oh , " Miranda says . There is an accident involving several cars . Waves roll in upon the beach . A man is being questioned by the fire department , and they have him tied to one of the ladders . Difficult things happen to him while he is tied to one of the ladders . " So true , " Miranda murmurs . " So true . " A city , or part of a city , is in flames . There is the sound of gunfire . A man in a villa beside a pool is playing Mozart . " Mozart , " Miranda whispers . A girl is decapitated . Bombs fall on an open field , and then on a village . Members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gunfire . Bullets . The man is bleeding heavily . The white marble beside the pool is stained with red ; the pool is red . In slow motion , a leg of one of the fire-department people is blown off , shredded , soaring , floating . " So true , so true , " Miranda murmurs . The Mozart stops . The body of a girl floats in the pool . The sky is in flames . The screen flickers off . The lights come on . Outside , once again , it is freezing cold . The ushers lean against the side of the building . The medals on the uniform of one of them have been torn nearly off , and dangle precariously from the tunic . It is snowing . The snow is light . The air is cold . The sidewalks are made of iron . Ants as Art Finding I could speak the language of ants , I approached one and inquired , " What is God like ? Does He resemble the ant ? " He answered , " God ! No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but God , He has two ! " ? Old Central Asian felktale . ARMY ants are one of the possible nightmare phenomena . According to the late T. H. White , the ant is one of the seven creatures in the world that conduct organized warfare against their own kind . Driver ants , the African kind of army ant , bivouac underground in such gigantic numbers that , we 've been told , they once forced an entire city of a hundred thousand people to evacuate by undermining the foundations of the houses with their tunnels . This unpleasant beast is now on display at Automation House , on East Sixty-eighth Street , and it 's just incredible to see him in action . A million army ants of the kind known as Eciton hamatum are living in a big pen that shows to good advantage a particular characteristic of theirs , which is to make houses and bridges out of themselves . Here 's how they do it : a few hundred thousand of the little fellows get together and form long living chains . Each ant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about four hundred square feet big , and the squeamish will he glad to note that the walls of the pen are lined with plastic , which is the one thing they ca n't climb , because their little feet slip . We went to a press preview of the ants the other day , and admired them immensely , because they were very interesting . The ants come from Panama , and they are in New York to be a work of art , having been brought here by an artist , whose name is Alan Son-fist . He comes from the Bronx . We interviewed Mr. Sonfist . He told us about collecting ants in Panama . " I was out in the jungle one night last month . Pitch-black , and I had only a flashlight . I heard a funny noise , a sort of crinkling noise , and thought it must be raining . I realized , suddenly , that I was in the middle of a colony of swarm raiders  --  the kind of army ant that eats everything in sight . By the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I knew what the sound was . It was all the other animals and insects running away from the approaching army ants . " We were interrupted . A lady from the Indianapolis Star asked if he had been scared . " No , " said Sonfist . " I was n't . I had enough knowledge to realize they were n't doing anything harmful to me . I just brushed them off . " " Well , just how many army - ants are there in a colony , anyway ? " asked the lady . " Hard to say , " said Sonfist . " I guess about a million . " " God almighty ! " said the lady . " I once lived on a farm in Macomb , Illinois , for two years , " said Mr. Son-fist . " I suppose that 's where you saw your first ant , " said the lady . " Well , I saw my first pig there . " The official title of the ants is " Army Ants : Patterns and Structures . " The exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be on view until March 17th . Cacoyannis ICHAEL CACOYANNIS , the Greek director who has made highly successful film versions of " Electra , " " Zorba the Greek , " and " The Trojan Women , " has been  --  rather improb-ably , it seemed to us  --  in residence at juilliard 's American Opera Center , where he recently staged a production of Puccini 's " La Boherne . " We tele-phoned Juilliard before the premiere of the production for details of this un-likely project , and discovered that " Bo-heme " was Mr. Cacoyannis 's second opera ( his first , a production of Marvin cd.e.re . MARCH 4 , 19 7 2 David Levy 's " Mourning Becomes Electra , " at the Metropolitan , was a critical success and a box-office disaster ) and that he was working with two casts of enthusiastic student singers . " We do n't know why he suddenly accepted our offer , " a Juilliard official said , sounding a bit stunned , " but he 's pulling some extraordinary performances out of our young people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Paris of Toulouse-Lautrec  --  the Paris that existed in 1895 , when Puccini was writing the score . You ought to come up and see what 's going on . " We arrived at the Juilliard Theatre in time to catch the final act of Mr. Cacoyannis 's dress rehearsal and found four young bohemians romping merrily around their famous attic , a drab , cluttered room dominated by a central floor-to-ceiling skylight . On one side of the room , Rodolfo , the poet , and Mar-cello , the painter , were engaged in a mincing mock-ballet ; on the other , Caine , the philosopher , and Schaunard , the musician , were duelling la Errol Flynn with fire tongs . Halfway back in the auditorium we spotted Mr. Cacoyannis , a wiry , intense man in his late forties who has small , even features , brown eyes , a high forehead , and a mass of curly gray hair . He was wearing a blue turtleneck pullover , gray slacks , and a brown suede jacket , and he was smoking Gauloises as he dictated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying heroine of the opera , made her final entrance , the conductor stopped the orchestra to slow down some rapid tempi . Mr. Cacoyannis bounded onstage to remind Rodolfo that he was a bit late coming forward to console Mimi . " When she puts out her hand and asks for you , you must be there immediately , " he said , collapsing in an armchair to demonstrate the proper position for Mimi 's death scene . " Do n't kneel in front of the chair or you will block her light . " The singers nodded , and finished the act with a passionate conviction that brought cheers from several hundred Juilliard students who were watching from the auditorium . As the curtain fell , the Juilliard orchestra  --  which had played superbly under the baton of a twenty-one-year-old conductor named James Cordon  --  broke into an impromptu version of " Never on Sunday . " Mr. Cacoyannis , who was onstage lining up the cast for curtain calls , paused in astonishment and then saluted the musicians with a broad smile . " That 's very nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , it comes from one of those Greek films I did n't diTHE NEW YORKER 31 " We 're ahead of America in women 's liberation , that 's for sure ! " rect . " Turning to the singers , he reminded them of a few tricky hits of stage business and added that the performance had gone very well . " The important thing is that you are , the people the opera is about , " he said . " You are young , you are poor , you are struggling for success as artists , and you have the vitality , the energy , of youth . Tomorrow , we will run through the acts in costume to check lighting cues , but nobody is permitted to sing a note . " The singers drifted off to their dressing rooms looking pleased but ap prehensive . We introduced ourself to Mr. Cacoyannis and asked him how a realistic film director happened to be staging an operatic chestnut . " I must be one of the very few people who have not seen a production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed ro do it precisely because I had no pre-conceived ideas about the opera . Then , when I worked on the score , I found it was not as corny and romantic as everybody thinks . Mimi , for example , is quite a strong personality . She 's ob-viously had previous affairs , she sleeps with Rodolfo the night she meets him , and between Acts III and IV she takes a rich viscount as a lover . Her relationship with Rodolfo is perhaps a bit sick , because it involves both jealousy and pity  --  emotions that arc very bad between people . The : VIusetta-Marcello affair is , in contrast , much healthier , because it 's very physical and very open . Also , there are wonderful dramatic moments , such as that last-act duel . Those boys go almost mad with high spirits , and suddenly death walks in the doorway . One has to cast this opera with young people , because they provide a genuineness , a ' vulnerability that would be missing with experienced singers . I can imagine how they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my twenties , and I know what a horrifying experience it is to sing in public . " Mr. Cacoyannis worked in the theatre in England during the Second World War and until the early nineteen-fifties , when he returned to his native Greece and began to write and direct films . " Film is a realistic medium , and I try to use mostly exteriors , " he said . " Real soil , real rocks , real sun . In the theatre , you have to build up and project the essential dramatic truth . In cinema , acting has to be the truth itself . " We asked Mr. Cacoyannis if he planned to finish the Euripidcan trilogy he began with " Electra . " " That is another problem , " he said . " Before the coup , I was a Greek filmmaker based in Greece , working with my own family of actors and technicians . Also , I was living within a reality that I was part of , and I was able to express this reality on film . To evoke Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we made ' The Trojan Women ' in Spain  --  is extremely difficult . " " What do you think will happen in Greece ? " we asked . Mr. Cacoyannis lit a cigarette and considered our question . " It is a political fact , " he said slowly , " that no twentieth-century European dictatorship has been overthrown from the inside . But I think there will he a gradual change of climate . The Greeks are far more independent than this man who is now in control ; as people grow less afraid , the balance may change . " Fire WE were descending some subway stairs the other morning when a woman a few steps below us turned sharply and aimed a fearful glance in our direction . We saw that it was Janet . " Oh , hi , " she said , with her customary exuberance . " I thought you might be someone trying to kill me . It 's impossible not to meet people in the subway . I always turn sharply if I hear something behind me , and then I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 'm sorry , I thought ynu were trying to kill me , ' I say , and they say , ' I understand . ' They 're usually married and live too far away from me , so that 's the end of the relation-shiPAs . " we followed Janet down to the platform , where a train was just pulling away , she asked , " Did ynu recognize me in this heavy coat ? " She peered at her lapels . " I was eating an ice-cream cone in it last night . Did we just miss a train ? " We shrugged , to indicate that it did n't matter . " I 'm throwing a party on the twelfth , " Janet went on , taking the loss of a train in her stride . " Can you come ? If I were still married , it would be my twentieth anniversary . You want to sec the party list ? " She groped in her handbag and pulled out a handful of pieces of paper . We glanced into the subway tunnel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur Murray 's , " she said after examining her papers for a minute or two . " I keep forgetting to go , They call me up ? This is Diane , ' This is Greta . ' They do n't know that I used to teach there myself . I wonder if they 're teaching the same steps . " A train roared past us without stopping . " Fortunately , I did n't want that train , " said Janet . " A strange man I met last week told me it was worse for the people inside who thought they were going to get off at this stop . We had coffee at Chock Full o ' Nuts . I have his card . Do you know about my fire ? " We said no , and leaned hack against a gum machine . " Well , " she began , " I 'm off sleeping pills , you know . Now I drink two glasses of wine instead . So I was absolutely --  Not exactly passed out . What would you call it after two glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sleeping soundly , " Janet said . " I was sleeping soundly , and at midnight the kids burst into my room screaming , ' Mummy , Mommy , there 's a fire ! ' I was kind of groggy , and I did n't want to get up , so I said , ' Put on your coats , take the cat , and go down and tell the super . ' I wanted all the living things to get out of the house . There was this terrible smell in the apartment . You might call it a stench . You could n't breathe . I thought it might be the boiler about to explode in the basement , which it does periodically , usually at the same time the elevator stops running  --  which would make the stairs very crowded if there was a fire . I live in a rent-controlled building . " THE NEW YORKER Janet paused for a second or two and continued , " Anyway , I got up and opened the window , so would n't suffocate , and then I went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save . If you save something made by one child , then you have to save something made by the other one . I saw myself standing out in the street holding a Tait of clad pots . So I decided not to save anything . I was muttering to myself , To hell with it . ' Just as I was passing out again , I heard all these sirens . " Janet imitated the sirens . " It turned out that my kids went next door , and my neighbor there called the Fire Department . I was furious at them . I did n't want to call the Fire Depart-merit just for a smell . I just had time to throw on a robe when millions of guys burst in through the front door and the hack door waving their clubs . " To smash things with , " she added . " I said , ' It smells like a boiler exploding , ' but a fireman said it smelled more . like the handle of a teakettle , so I went into the kitchen and smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left the burner On . " Janet looked vague . " And I guess someone must have turned it off , which is why there was no fire , just a smell . I threw out the teakettle , and now we have to boil water in a regular pot that does n't even make a noise . I was standing there apologizing for not having a huge fire , and for not being ready for company . I kept saying , ' I look terrible , ' and the firemen said , No , you do n't look terrible , ' and one of my kids was saying , ' Yes , you do . ' I had on this torn red flannel robe that should he at the cleaners , and no makeup . I offered them all a drink , because they were Irish . I could tell because they all looked alike . The same height , the same age , and they all had blue eves . At least , I think they did . I had just read in the paper that day about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked them about it . They had heard of it , too , and they said they were looking forward to the movie . They could n't drink , because they were on duty , but they said they could n't leave , either , until the captain came up . ' The captain ! ' I said . ' I have n't got any makeup on . ' I rushed into the bathroom to put some brown stuff cm  --  undercover makeup , it 's called but by the time I came hack they were all trooping out the door . I asked them if any of them played an instrument . I said , Hey , do n't go , wait a minute , do any of you guys play an instrument ? We 're starting a symphony orchestra in the Housing Authority . ' " Janet explained to us , " That 's where ? I work now . I take subways now that I 'm working . I ca n't afford cabs anymore . It 's the first time I 've ever worked for a bureaucracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form in triplicate . Anyway , one of the firemen said he had a cousin who plays the flute and , luckily , lives in a project . I gave them a poster to put up in the firehouse . We need a string section the most . This girl next door , I think she 's the real reason the firemen left , because she was telling them some long story about a cord she used ro live with , an electric wire that did something . ' I always call the Fire Department , ' she kept saying . " Janet looked exasperated . " I thought of them as my firemen , " she said . " I was so glad when they said they had another call . I said , ' Oh , good , maybe you 'll get a real fire this time . Quick , go save someone. , , , A train approached . " I think this must he the right train , " Janet said . " It 's stopping . " We followed her onto the train . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " there was a knock on my door , and there were these two black ladies , saying ' We 're Jehovah 's Witnesses , ' so I said , ' Come in . ' I could hear my kids groan . I noticed a black man knocking on the door across the hall , and I said , ' Come on over here if you 're a Jehovah 's Witness . She ? wo n't let you in . She wo n't even open the door for the egg man . ' So they all came in . They were talking about the Bible , but I wanted to talk about politics . The man kept saying , ' Saint Joseph says ' and ' Saint Somebody ' ? quoting various saints and I was ask-ing them who they wanted for President . Finally , did n't want to upset them , so I said , ' What do you think Frederick Douglass thought about religioni ' I do n't know myself , because I never read all the hooks I bought for that course I took . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with it . I said it was an opiate of the people , and it 's supposed to get slaves of the track , so they wo n't do anything . They asked me if I had a Bible in the house . I kept pulling out these large black books , which all turned Out to be dictionaries . They look the same because the words do n't run all the way across the page . I found three dictionaries and no Bibles , so / bought a light-green Bible for a dollar . They marked the passages a couple of prophets and I promised to read them as long as I did n't have to learn them by heart . I told them I believed in the Golden Rule , and they said that was all right for a start . They told me they were going to conic back and tell me the truth in a couple of weeks . By the way , what stop are you getting off at " We shrugged .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
