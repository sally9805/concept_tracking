txt Despite supposed public disillusionment with political leaders , Americans are giving record sums to national political campaigns . In the first half of this year . presidential candidates raised more than twice as much as in the same period four years ago ? the top 10. money raisers collecting $9.4 million through June , 1979 , compared with $4.2 million in 1975 . Fund-raising prospects for some presidential candidates ? most prominently Republican John Connally of Texas , the leading money raiser so far ? are reportedly good enough that their campaign directors are considering doing without federal matching funds . They reason that the risk of having to almost double campaign receipts on their own may be worth taking , to avoid federal spending limitations attached to matching grants . New Hampshire 's $300,000 spending limit , for example , does not permit as much campaign firepower as candidates would like to focus there , campaign strategists say . President Carter , well ahead of his 1975 contributions pace , already has collected twice as much as incumbent Gerald Ford did in all of 1975 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this year , according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) . Mr. Ford had barely begun fund raising at midyear 1975 , with $10,000 reported . Despite the President 's head start , the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) is again trouncing its Democratic counterpart in fund raising ? by a 12-to-1 margin so far this year . The three RNC accounts ? the committee itself , plus its Senate and House campaigns  - -  have raised $13.4 million through June 30. compared with $1.16 million for the Democratic National Committee . The Democrats hope to close some of the ground with their big fund-raiser of the year . a $1,000-a-plate gala in Washington Sept. 26 . But the Republicans are expected to maintain their financial edge . " The Democrats just are n't into fund rais- ing with the depth and expertise of the Republican National Committee , who are reaping the benefits of four or five years of direct-mail experience , " says Kent Cooper . director of campaign financial disclosure for the FEC Contrary to what might be expected . the Republicans do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cooper says . In 1975-1976 , the last two-year presidential campaign season , the Republicans raised 526.5 million in contributions under $100. while the Democrats collected $7.3 million . // From page 1 US candidates amass funds at record pace Jack Faris , RNC finance director , reports that the average contribution this year has been $34 . " Eighty-one percent of our contributions came in through direct-mail solicitations , in amounts less than $100 , " he says . Though the average gift was down a little , the RNC had 340,000 givers the first seven months of 1979 , or 10,000 more than last year ? " an unusual response for an off-election year , " Mr. Faris says . By contrast , the Democratic National Committee for the past 12-month period reports 57.000 givers . Raising money appears to be no obstacle for the major Senate races . Two-thirds of the 34 contested seats are held by Democrats , several of them targeted for ? costly media attacks by right-wing groups . The Republican National Committee is planning to boost its Senate campaign spending from $3.3 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to within a few seats of control in the Senate and because with populous states like Pennsylvania , Illinois , New Jersey , California , and New York picking senators , campaigning will be more expensive . The contest for Republican Sen. Jacob Javits 's New York seat , whether or not he retires , is expected to be the most expensive race apart from the presidency . " At least five candidates could spend a million dollars each in New York , " says Larry McCarthy , spokesman for the national Republican Senate committee . The conservative spending assault on Democratic liberal Sens . George McGovern of South Dakota , Birch Bayh of Indiana , Alan Cranston of California , Frank Church of Idaho , and John Culver of Iowa likely will make money raising easier for these incumbents , their supporters claim . " Frankly , I do n't anticipate any trouble raising money for a race in South Dakota , " says Owen Donley , aide to Senator McGovern , thought to be one of the most vulnerable incumbents . The senator has $135,000 in hand toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold fund-raising receptions or petition his many direct-mail contributors from past campaigns . " Fund raising is going better than I expected , " says Jody Krajewski , treasurer of California Gov . Edmund G. Brown Jr . ' s exploratory presidential campaign committee . " There are so many running in California for state offices . Seven were already raising money before we began . We 're already having good luck with phone solicitations . " Heavy start-up costs for direct-mail solicitation have put the presidential campaign of Illinois Republican Rep. Philip M. Crane into the red . " We expect to be in the black by the end of the year , " says Crane spokesman Ron Wright . And regardless of how much it costs to raise it , the Crane receipts by Dec. 30 should qualify the campaign for $4 million in federal matching funds to carry through the primaries . Indeed , qualifying for federal matching funds is one of the reasons behind the early fund-raising spurt among presidential candidates . For candidates who accept matching funds , the primary spending limit this year will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
