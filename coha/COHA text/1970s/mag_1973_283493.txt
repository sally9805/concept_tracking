Finally home after nearly eight years in a North Vietnamese prison camp , Air Force Captain Edward Alan Brudno beamed joyously as he stepped from a plane in Massachusetts and hugged his wife close . " Words like unbelievable , exciting and unreal perfectly describe the fantastic excitement of being reborn , " he exulted . That was 16 weeks ago . A month later Brudno 's mood had changed . " I knew the initial euphoria would pass , and it has , " he confided to the wife of a fellow P.O.W. " I 'm feeling pretty depressed these days . " Brudno 's despair deepened , and last week he ended his life with an overdose of sleeping pills . Before he died , he wrote , in French , " My life is no longer worth living . " <P> Brudno 's death tragically confirmed the warnings sounded by psychiatrists before release of the prisoners . They had predicted that many men might return emotionally scarred for life ( TIME , Feb. 19 ) . Los Angeles Psychoanalyst Helen Tausend had said that captivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , " and Yale Psychiatrist Robert J. Lifton had suggested that the war 's unpopularity would lead many prisoners to conclude that their suffering had been in vain . Something like this may have happened to Brudno . Like all suicides , Brudno 's act must have had many causes , some predating the war . " There was no specific thing that caused his depression , " says his brother Robert . But both he and his wife Deborah had changed in subtle ways , and he soon discovered that Deborah and her parents had been active against the war to which he had been so deeply committed . <P> Brudno 's suicide came two days after Pentagon Health Chief Richard Wilbur announced that all former Viet Nam prisoners would be counseled for five years . The Government 's goal : to prevent the violent deaths common among American servicemen who survived imprisonment in the Far East during World War II and the Korean War . According to Wilbur , these men " did badly " after their release . Of the deaths that occurred in the group from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for Viet Nam prisoners , all have suffered from a transient " stress reaction " ( euphoria , fear or depression ) , and most are having difficulty " moving back into a family . " <P> Learning of Brudno 's death , one psychiatrist bluntly predicted that other suicides were likely . Hoping to head off that possibility , the Air Force set about learning everything it could about Brudno . The son of James Brudno , a Quincy , Mass. , physician , Alan was an introverted boy with few friends . He earned a degree in aeronautical engineering at M.I.T. and dreamed of becoming an astronaut . A few months before he shipped out to Viet Nam , he married Deborah Gitenstein of Harrison , N.Y . Eight days before he was due to return to the U.S. , he was shot down . " They kept him alone in a tiny cell without even a cot , " his father told TIME last week . " He had to sleep on a hard stone floor . In the mornings they 'd serve him some gruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy to study French and , according to Air Force Lieut . Colonel Kenneth North , imprisoned in a cell adjoining Brudno 's , he seemed " in solid shape . "
