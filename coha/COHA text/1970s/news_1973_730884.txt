txt A woman drove into a taxicab garage here not long ago and pulled a pistol on the attendant . She demanded gasoline , not money . The incident was not really astonishing to residents of fuelstarved Denver , named the hardest-hit city in the national fuel shortage by the American Automobile Association . One irate motorist reported that he had to " tip " an attendant $5 to buy $3 worth of gasoline . The acute gasoline shortage , which became worse after Memorial Day , seemed to reach its most acute level about Independence Day , and has remained there ever since . RESIDENTS who often were lured here in the first place by the Rocky Mountains , are forced to cut down or cease their trips into the mountains . Out-of-state tourists , who brought in about $500 million to Colorado 's economy last summer , are staying away . Tourism is the state 's third largest industry , but state officials predict that this year 's revenues will drop between $50 million and $100 million if there is no relief .. Experts see no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then gasoline-starved Denver is a glimpse into the nation 's future ? a future of a strangled lifestyle , confusion , hoarding , and desperate motorists lining up early to purchase fuel from stations that sell gas only three to five hours a day , five or six days a week . ACTUALLY , the tourists who stay away are doing so largely on misinformation . The shortage is barely evident in Colorado outside the Denver area . Tourists often assume that the problem is statewide . Wyoming , which generally is regarded to be not quite as scenic as western Colorado , suffers from no gas shortage . It reports tourism is up this year about 18 per cent . ONE GROUP of suburban housewives rode a horse pack train into town to shop for groceries . Altho no specific figures are available , the city 's new bicycle lanes have plenty of travelers . Patronage on the city-owned bus lines rose 17.2 per cent in the first week of July when compared with the corresponding period in 1972 . The fuel crunch appears to have brightened political prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of interviews with petroleum executives here , it became apparent that the oil industry has sufficient fuel to alleviate the Denver shortage , but companies find that trucking fuel here reduces their profits . One local petroleum execuz tive , who asked not to be identified , said be recently found an " unlimited " supply of gasoline ready for shipment from Houston , but because of transportation costs he could n't arrange distribution to Denver . DURING THE last two weeks , individual oil companies have announced with some fanfare that they were ' trucking extra allocations to the Denver area , but so far the amounts have n't been sufficient to make any significant impact . Some executives speculated there might not be enough trucks to transport all the extra fuel needed to end the shortage here . R. L. Lindauer Jr. , public affairs manager for the Exxon Company 's Rocky Mountain region , candidly observed that " if the retail price were right , I 'm sure enough trucks would turn up someplace .
