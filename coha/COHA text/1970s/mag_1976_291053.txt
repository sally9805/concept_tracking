" I want the American people to understand my character , my weaknesses , the kind of person lam. " - Jimmy Carter <P> Stumping the country for some 21 months now , Candidate Carter has revealed a great deal about himself . At times he has been extraordinarily - even embarrassingly-candid about his personal views on subjects ranging from religion to lust . Yet many of Carter 's strong supporters still regard him as an ; enigma , a kind of populist Hamlet whose cross-purposes and mixed signals have so jammed the nation 's sen sory network that little more than static has emerged at the receiving end . A line from a Kris Kristofferson song might well have been written about Carter 's multifaceted personality : " He 's a walking contradiction/ Partly truth and partly fiction . " <P> American voters have come to expect simpler images-and simpler answers-from their politicians than Carter provides . A candidate who tries to appeal to Playboy readers on one hand ( see following story ) and to evangelicals on the other , who promises tax reform but says he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both to God and Rock Superstar Gregg Allman , violates all the unwritten political norms . By appealing to such differing constituencies , he has magnified the uncertainties about his character and positions . Those doubts could cost him an election that seemed to be his for the taking a couple of months ago . <P> Most politicians cultivate an appearance of is at home in Plains , pitching softball , draining ponds and filleting bass . But he is hardly ordinary . He is complex , a sometimes lonely and introspective man who has spent much of his life attempting to balance contending forces : parents who were political opposites , the Old South and the New , the various factions of the Democratic Party . <P> To win in 1976 , he has an obvious need to demonstrate that he is no mere regional candidate . He seeks approval from voters of almost every conceivable description and , in the process , often ventures into a political wilderness . He quotes Kierkegaard ( " Every man is an exception " ) and Dylan Thomas ( " Great is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) . He discusses his attitudes on death and " ethnic purity , " analyzes the biblical injunction against adultery and admits he has been " tempted to judge other people without charity since I was a small child . " <P> He does not so much say different things to different audiences as emphasize different aspects of his background . Before naval construction workers in Groton , Conn. , he stresses his years in the Navy and his belief in " a strong , muscular defense . " Before the B'nai B'rith in Washington , he notes that he and other Baptists consider the creation of Israel to be " the fulfillment of biblical prophecy . " Speaking to farmers in Des Moines , he reminds them that he too is a farmer and urges an end to grain embargoes.
