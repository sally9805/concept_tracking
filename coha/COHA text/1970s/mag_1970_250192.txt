Like most auto manufacturers in headlong pursuit of the youth market , General Motors Corp . has saturated much of its car advertising with the hip jargon of the dragstrip . Yet for many consumers , including the young , the ads , with their mod vernacular , seemed as strained and unbelievable as a middle-aged matron attempting to dance the watusi . Now , faced with an uncertain economy and slumping car sales , G.M. officials have apparently decided to end their fixation with power and youth in advertising and focus it instead on value and comfort . <P> The first hint of the new advertising policy came in an unusual speech several months ago by G.M. President Edward Cole . " Too much emphasis is being directed toward the youthful segment of our population , " he said . " I think that advertising has forgotten who the customer is-and how to reach him . " Cole 's words sent the company 's division chiefs to their telephones with new instructions for their ad agencies . A picture-taking session for new Pontiac promotions was interrupted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pose in conventional clothes . " Youthful " ad copy for the sporty 1970 Firebird , which will be introduced this month , was hastily rewritten . <P> The change in advertising emphasis was even more pronounced for Buick 's new models . Last September , ads for the Skylark GS 455 and the Skylark Custom Sports Coupe were headlined : " Introducing automobiles to light your fire . " The copy stressed such performance features as " a 455-cubic inch 360-horsepower engine with a high-lift cam and four-barrel carburetor which breathes through real air scoops . " By January , ads for the Skylark were headlined " Something to Believe In , " and the copy noted such features as hidden windshield wipers and six coats of paint , while stressing " product integrity . " <P> Chevrolet was also affected . In October , ads for the Chevelle SS 396 , featuring a blazing red model with black stripes and racing-style hood pins , warned that " In ten seconds your resistance will self-destruct . " But by November , the ads showed a similar model colored a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We built more car into the car . " Chevy is also emphasizing comfort and resale value in its " big rider " campaign for the Impala . <P> For the moment , Ford , Chrysler and American Motors give no sign of drastically revising their advertising . Yet the sober values of Middle America are rapidly replacing the often giddy priorities that characterized the nation 's buying - and selling-habits over the last decade . As the consumer becomes increasingly cost-conscious , a rising stress on value in auto advertising is almost a certainty .
