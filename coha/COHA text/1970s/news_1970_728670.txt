txt The House passed today a clean air act that went considerably beyond earlier legislation in the stringency of its antipollution standards and in the penalties imposed on industry for noncompliance . The vote on the bill , which was technically an amendment to the Air Quality Act of 1967 , was 374 to 1 . The one opponent was Representative Glenn Cunningham , Republican of Nebraska . The bill authorized for the next three years appropriations totaling $775-million ? $200-million for the fiscal year 1971 ; $250-million for the fiscal year 1972 and $325-million for the fiscal year 1973 . Of the total , $300-million would be earmarked for research on controlling pollution from combustion of coal , oil and gasoline . The amount authorized was somewhat less than the figure proposed in a companion bill in the Senate sponsored by Senator Edmund S. Muskie , Democrat of Maine , chairman of the Subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution of the Public Works Committee . The Muskie // bill would provide $1.154-billion over four years ? an annual average of $288-million . However , the House bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commerce , authorizes almost double the $106-million that Mr. Nixon allotted in his budget for the fiscal year 1971 , the first year of his proposed program . Aside from the money the House bill follows the Nixon proposals rather closely . The present law authorizes the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare to designate air quality regions and to approve air quality standards adopted in those regions on the basis of criteria established by his department for various pollutants . Procedure Called Slow The House committee agreed with Mr. Nixon that the procedure for the designation of air quality control regions had *yen slow and cumbersome . As a result , the panel said in its report , few such regions have been established , and " consequently actual air pollution enforcement activities have been delayed excessively . " Therefore , the committee followed Mr. Nixon 's suggestion for setting up national air quality standards on the basis of criteria already supplied by the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare for five pollutants ? sulphur oxides , particulate matter , carbon monoxide , hydrocarbons and photochemical oxidants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each state would be designated an air quality region , although the Secretary could establish interstate regions . The states would have to meet national standards , but an dndividual state or interstate region could adopt stricter ones . Under the bill , within 60 days after the promulgation of an air quality standard , a state may file with the Department of Health , Education and Welfare a letter of intent stating that it will adopt an implementation plan , after public hearings , within 180 days . This implementation period may be extended 180 days , but no longer . If the state does not file a statement of intent or adopt a plan , the Secretary may publish a plan for the state . If the state fails to enforce the plan , the Attorney General may bring suit against air quality violators who , on conviction , may be fined up to $10,000 a day . Furthermore , the Secretary is given the authority , which he does not now possess , to inspect any plant . The House bill also follows the President 's recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution where emissions are " ' extremely hazardous " or where they contribute " substantially " to the endangerment of public health . The Senate bill is expected to extend such standards to any hazardous emissions , whether from new plants or old ones . Cars Inspected Under the present law , the department inspects automobile prototypes before issuing certificates of compliance with exhaust emission standards . Under the House bill , it is " authorized and directed " to test autos as they come off the inspection line . The department is also authorized  --  but not directed  --  to establish limits on additives in motor fuel , such as lead , or to eliminate them . Before taking such action , the Secretary must make certain specific findings as to its necessity . There is no such authority in the , present law , which governs only motors and not automobile fuels . Although the Secretary now has the agreement of the airline industry to abate smoke emissions from aircraft , he does not have the authority to set emission standards . The House bill gives him this authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comply with Federal and state and local emission standards . The committee said that " instead of exercising leadership in controlling or eliminating air pollution , the Federal Government has tended to be slow . "
