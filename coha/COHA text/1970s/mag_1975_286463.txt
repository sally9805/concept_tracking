LIES MY FATHER TOLD ME Directed by JAN KADAR Screenplay by TED ALLAN <P> The setting is a Montreal ghetto , around 1925 . The protagonist is an extraordinarily appealing little boy named David ( Jeffrey Lynas ) . Struggling for possession of his young mind are his father ( Len Birman ) and his grandfather ( Yossi Yadin ) . The former is a hustler , determined to abandon traditional Jewish ways and invent his way upward ( creaseless pants , expandable cuff links-so you can roll up your sleeves without unlinking them ) . The latter is a sweet-spirited , loving junk dealer , who is equally determined to imbue David with the belief that an Orthodox faith can still serve successfully as a guide to existence . <P> The contest , in short , is no contest . Fast-talking Dad is insensible to the emotional needs of the child or anyone else . Grandfather , besides being so nice , conducts his business from a horse-drawn wagon and lets David accompany him . What kid could resist him ? <P> Based by Writer Ted Allan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lies My Father Told Me is a difficult movie to dislike . It deals mainly in the small change of daily doings-quarrels and friendships on the alley-courtyard where the boy lives , modest hopes raised and dashed , problems and disappointments clumsily but affectionately managed . Even the father is not really a bad man , just bombastic . <P> Familiar Stereotypes . Yet for all its affability , Lies is not a very effective work . The courtyard 's population , for example , is a very predictable one . David 's mother is long-suffering , the neighbors familiar stereotypes from a hundred warm-spirited recollections of ghetto life-a scholarly revolutionist , a troublemaking yenta , a feisty and good-spirited whore . The minute we meet them , we can call the turns they will eventually do , just as we know , almost from the film 's first minute , that Grandfather will die before it ends . <P> Czech Director Jan Kadar ( The Shop on Main Street ) handles all his vignettes dryly , distantly , without the slightest excess of emotion . Normally such discipline , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter for applause . In a film that is so predictable , however , a little excess is called for . We need to feel a touch of genuine desperation in this slum or of craziness in the behavior of its inhabitants . Some how the Duddy Kravitz ambience has been infused with the spirit of Walton 's Mountain , and the result is a bland respectability-safe , pleasant , without reverberation . <P> Richard Schickel
