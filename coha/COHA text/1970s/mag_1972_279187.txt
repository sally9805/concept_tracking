An American lady vacationing in Italy seeks advice at the American consulate in Florence . She gets a crisp brush-off from a pompous young vice consul . " I pay your salary , young man , " she protests , but in vain . That scene in Olivia de Havilland 's 1962 movie , Light in the Piazza , often evokes a knowing chuckle from seasoned American travelers . U.S. consuls have a reputation-sometimes deserved , frequently not-of being coldly impervious to fellow citizens in distress . Now that the expanding but unreliable charter-flight business is leaving a growing number of travelers high and dry ( TIME , Sept. 4 ) , the question of the consuls ' responsibilities is more pressing than ever . <P> Britons to the Rescue . Two weeks ago , 122 Americans found themselves stranded for four days at London 's Gatwick Airport . The Daedalus Travel Agency in New York , bookers of their charter flight , had failed to provide a plane for the return trip . When the Americans sent a deputation to the U.S. embassy , they were " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tourist from Queens , N.Y . " The embassy was adamantly opposed to giving us aid or getting us out of there . " Eventually Britons came to the rescue . The British Social Service dispensed cash for food . The Grosvenor Hotel put the travelers up for a night in $20-a-day rooms without charge , and British Caledonian Airways and Wimpy International Ltd. , a hamburger chain , chartered a plane and flew them home free . <P> On the other hand , when 80 travelers were stranded in Moscow last week by an overbooked regular flight on Aeroflot , the twelve Americans involved had a very different experience . The U.S. and British consuls painstakingly negotiated with Aeroflot to fly the strandees out the next evening-although not before the travelers , who had no transit visas , spent several hours locked up in their hotel . When the U.S. consul went to convey the good news , he was besieged by angry Japanese who claimed that they were ignored by their consul . " A novel experience for an American consul , " he commented . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , there are a great many misconceptions about his powers . If the State Department gives prior approval , a consul can aid a strandee by making a repatriation loan for the price of a return ticket , plus a small subsistence allowance-both on condition that the strandee surrender his passport . The State Department then holds the passport until the loan is repaid . In practice , only the mentally ill , the seriously injured , the infirm , the aged and " those with a hardship story good enough to make strong men weep , " to quote a longtime observer , have any hope of being repatriated . <P> A big U.S. embassy like the one in Paris arranges between ten and 25 repatriations a year . Other cases are referred to the American Aid Society , an organization run by U.S. and French businessmen . In Japan , the Columbia Society of Yokohama lends Americans a helping hand with small loans and emergency cash . When visitors run afoul of local laws and regulations , embassy legal staffs are required to respond . But as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't break any track records going to the rescue .
