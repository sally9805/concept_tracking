Another Kennedy <P> To the Editors : <P> Just the mention of another Kennedy Nov. 5 White House gives me a surge of hope and a sense of patriotism . Call it the Kennedy mystique or charisma , but I choose to call it that intangible quality , leadership , and a feeling of well-being that the citizens of this country have not had since 1963 . <P> Perhaps Ted Kennedy wo n't solve all of America 's problems , but he will make them appear more bearable . <P> Roger D. Spickler South Bend , Ind . <P> Aw , gee whiz ! Why do n't we save ourselves a year of tiresome rhetoric and a lot of money too , and anoint by acclamation another of the Royal Family Kennedy as King-er , President ? With Camelot II and its fun and games established in the White House we will see how well charisma can run this country . While standing in awe of the new White House occupants , we will forget our troubles of inflation , unemployment , energy shortage and high medical costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think many people would vote for Edward Kennedy solely because he is the brother of a President . Billy Carter has the same qualification . <P> H. Gordon Havens Kansas City , Mo . <P> Ted may be ready to run for President now , but I 'm not ready to vote for him . <P> Donna S. Bailey Windsor Locks , Conn . <P> How difficult it will be for anyone , Democrat or Republican , to campaign against Ted Kennedy ! It just would n't be sporting to mention honor , courage , truth , fidelity , economy-mindedness , coverup , character , cheating , special privileges , confusion , irrationality or even such ordinary phrases as " crossing that bridge when we come to it " or " troubled waters . " The list seems endless . <P> Rita Craig Longboat Key , Fla . <P> I feel a man should be judged by what kind of man he is on a daily basis , not by his darkest moment . <P> Frederick Cleveland Milford , Mich . <P> Vegetarians ' Beef <P> Some have said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Essay Nov. 5 like " How to Beat the Beef Against Meat . " <P> Contrary to what Mr. Leo implies , not all vegetarians are young people following a fad . There are millions of vegetarians in this country , people of all ages and walks of life who have decided to abstain from meat for health , ecological and/or ethical reasons . <P> Julianna Bickus Normal , Ill . <P> I admit it ! I 'm a practicing vegetarian . By the age of two , I was exceptionally adept at avoiding the meat my parents continually poked in my direction . Receiving protein in the form of mangled flesh and sizzled blood vessels has never been my idea of nutrition . As to the argument of " faunaism , " I have yet to dissect a plant and discover a brain . <P> Carla G. Quick Salem , Ill . <P> I am one of those " uppity , bloodthirsty , macho , white males " who happen to love meat . I admit that occasionally I get a feeling of guilt mixed with nausea .
