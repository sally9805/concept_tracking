cIN Ankara , Turkey , as in a score of other capitals , the Czechoslovak embassy held a reception last week to celebrate the country 's liberation day . What made the occasion in Ankara so special was its host . Alexander Dubcek , who led Czechoslovakia through its " spring of freedom " in 1968 and became a hero to reformers both inside and outside his country , has served as Prague 's ambassador in Ankara since January . He has been stripped of all political power ; two months after taking up his duties in Turkey , he was even suspended from the Communist Party . TIME Correspondent James Bell recently visited Ankara to find out what has happened to the man who sought to give Communism " a human face . " Bell 's report : <P> The last important diplomatic problem between Prague and Ankara involved the divided island of Cyprus , and Dubcek 's predecessor settled that last summer by agreeing to stop the flow of Czechoslovak arms to the government of Archbishop Makarios . In other words , as far as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job in Ankara is to rusticate . He is doing his best to comply . But after more than three months of keeping a profile low enough to step on , Dubcek remains the Turkish capital 's star diplomatic attraction . <P> When he appears at receptions and parties , he is instantly surrounded by newsmen , Turkish officials and other diplomats . In a capital not noted for its excitement , the diplomatic gossip mill seems to run on practically nothing but Dubcek tidbits . " He told me he gets a letter every day from each of his three sons in Prague , " one woman reported . Even the local children have taken to looking out for him on his quiet walks through Kurulu Park , behind his residence . " Sometimes when the children see me they shout , ' Dubcek , Dubcek ! ' " he mentioned recently . " But they do n't bother me. " - <P> Their elders do . Dubcek 's press secretary has curtly turned down every request for an interview , usually with the snapped words : " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at social occasions , prefaces most conversations with a warning : " What I say must not be considered an interview . " On my visit to Ankara , while passing the gate of the plain , brownish gray building that serves as the chancellery of the Czechoslovak embassy , I happened to see Dubcek come out of his residence next door . He smiled when I wished him good morning , but the smile left his eyes when I told him that I was an American journalist . " No , " he said in English . Then he paused and added , " Please . " <P> Not surprisingly , Dubccek is seen most often with Soviet Ambassador Vasily Grubyakov , whom he visited even before presenting his credentials to President Cevdet Sunay . " That call , " said one observer , " was his real presentation of credentials . "
