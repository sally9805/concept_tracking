ONLY seven months ago , the world 's 23 largest oil companies signed the last of a series of agreements that will give the chief oil-exporting nations an extra $25 billion over the next five years . In return for that staggering raise , officials of the producing nations promised not to demand any more money during the life of the contracts , raising hopes that the world 's basic fuel would maintain fairly stable prices for the next half-decade . Yet last week both sides went back to the bargaining table . Although they disbanded temporarily without reaching any new agreement , the nearly inevitable result of their meetings in Geneva over the coming weeks will be new price increases . The raises will hit consumers in Europe , Japan and the U.S. in the form of higher bills for gasoline , heating fuel and other products . They will also give much more economic power , and more international political clout , to the oil-exporting countries , most of which are in the Middle East . <P> These nations forced the companies into negotiations by displaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil companies could play the exporting countries off against one another , often driving down demands from one government by threatening to buy more oil from others . But in negotiations beginning in 1969 , the eleven members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) * overcame their vast political and social differences . For the first time , they formed an oil suppliers ' cartel , which now provides more than 85% of Europe 's oil and 90% of Japan 's . The U.S. imports 23% of its oil , mostly from Venezuela , and by some industry estimates will have to get 60% of its oil from abroad by 1980 . <P> Drastic Action . One of OPEC 's latest demands is for a price rise to make up for the 8.6% devaluation of the dollar , the currency in which oil payments are calculated . The oil countries called for a compensating increase of 8.6% , thereby setting a sort of black-gold standard paralleling the monetary one . In addition , the exporting nations are asking for " participation , " meaning some form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> For their part , oil-company negotiators point out that the contracts already provide for 2.5% annual increases , which will help make up for currency fluctuations . As for the participation demand , the companies are understandably wary of transferring part ownership under decree , even if OPEC governments pay for their share , as they have promised . <P> The producing nations seem certain to win concessions on both points . Seized by the spell of economic nationalism , more and more of them are threatening to take drastic action . The Iraqis have demanded a 20% share in the production facilities of Iraq Petroleum Co. , which is owned by five international oil firms , including Jersey Standard . The ownership plan bogged down in the face of the company 's compensation claims growing out of a government seizure ten years ago . To speed things up , Iraqi officials announced ominously that they were " scrutinizing closely " current financial records . In Venezuela , under a recently passed Petroleum Reversion Act , the government got authority to direct company exploration projects and start preparing for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign firms start to expire .
