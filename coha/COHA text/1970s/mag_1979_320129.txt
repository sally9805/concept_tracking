A pirate whaler is rammed <P> Of all the ships still slaughtering whales , none is more loathed by conservationists than the infamous Sierra . Flying the Cyprus flag and owned by a shadowy Liechtenstein-based company , possibly with Japanese interests , the pirate whaler ignores all whaling agreements , hunts indiscriminately and makes its kills in a particularly cruel way : instead of the explosive-tipped harpoons used by most whalers , it employs the unarmed type . These do less damage to whale meat but only prolong the agony of the great mammals , often attracting other whales who , in trying to help their beleaguered brethren , are themselves caught . Last week , in a dramatic reversal , the hunter suddenly became the prey . <P> Sierra 's Moby Dick-like nemesis was not a great whale , but the Sea Shepherd , a converted British fishing trawler purchased by Cleveland Amory 's Fund for Animals . The conservationists ' ship spotted Sierra 180 miles off the coast of Portugal and shadowed it toward Oporto , where it was expected to unload its cargo of whale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sierra balked at entering the harbor , the leader of the antiwhaling expedition , Paul Watson , 28 , of Vancouver , put Shepherd 's captain and 14 crew members ashore , then headed back out to sea with two other crewmen . <P> Its bow packed with 100 tons of cement , the 789-ton Shepherd bore down on the lighter Sierra and struck a glancing blow . Explained Watson : " I tried to take off the harpoon . " Then , after making a 360 turn , the avenging trawler opened up to twelve knots and hit again , this time punching a gaping hole amidships . Taking on water , Sierra limped into port , and , according to Watson , should be out of action for months , if not permanently . Watson 's own ship suffered nothing more than a battered bow . <P> Four and a half hours later , as it steamed north to England , Shepherd was intercepted by a Portuguese destroyer and ordered back to Oporto . There Watson found that one of his crew , Richard Morrison , 27 , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfront scuffle with Sierra crewmen and was hospitalized with a severe concussion . The Sierra sailors , many of them South Africans , were detained , but at week 's end most had been discharged , and any legal action about the skirmishing on land or sea was still up in the air . <P> Melodramatic as the battle of Oporto may have been , it was largely anticlimactic . Major whalers are already in retreat , having suffered a stinging defeat two weeks ago at a London meeting of the International Whaling Commission ( I.W.C. ) , which overwhelmingly voted to ban hunting of all whales ( except the still numerous minkes ) by factory ships on the high seas ; only coastal whaling will be permitted . The I.W.C . also approved creation of a whale sanctuary in the Indian Ocean . <P> Though the Japanese grumbled that they were not endangering the great mammals , both they and the Soviets , the only nations owning fleets of factory whalers , are expected to abide by the I.W.C . decisions . Antiwhalers figure that may save some 10,000 whales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pirates like Sierra do not step up their own operations . If so , conservation groups will surely retaliate , and that could be trouble for humans as well as whales .
