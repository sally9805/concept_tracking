Lee lacocca thought he had a better idea . An eager young sales manager in the 1950s , he figured he would pep up a dull convention of 1,100 Ford salesmen by proving in a live demonstration that if he dropped an egg from a 10-ft-high ladder onto Ford 's new crash-padded dashboard , the egg would not break . He was wrong . Until last week , that was one of the very few times that lacocca came close to having egg on his face . After 32 years with Ford , the plain-spoken son of an Italian immigrant was a Horatio Alger-hero on wheels , a paradigm of upward automobility . Yet unlike others who have risen through the sober , polyester-clad ranks of America 's most important industry , lacocca is perpetually outspoken , fashionably dressed in European worsteds and as obviously at ease in a barroom throbbing with used-Ford salesmen as in a hearing room full of Senators . If humans can be said to have automotive analogues , lacocca suggests nothing so much as a Ford Mustang , that stylish-yet-democratic car whose creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacocca was born in Allentown , Pa. , into what can be described as a Ford family . His father drove a Model T , launched one of the nation 's earliest rent-a-car agencies , made and lost several pre-Depression fortunes by renting Fords and trading in local real estate . Young Lido decided he wanted to enter the auto business , preferably with Ford . He got an engineering degree at nearby Lehigh University , signed on with Ford as a trainee , earned a master 's in engineering at Princeton and then surprised Ford recruiters by rejecting a quiet career in automatic transmissions for the tough world of sales . <P> In ten years as a salesman , lacocca sold so many cars that Ford Vice President Robert McNamara brought him to Detroit as marketing director for Ford trucks . In 1960 , at the precocious age of 36 , lacocca attained what was at one time his life 's goal , a Ford vice presidency ( in charge of the Ford Division ) . It was not a complete triumph ; his plan had been to be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as to what amount of money he would like to be making , " his wife Mary once said . " Like maybe in five years he might like to be making $5,000 and in ten years $10,000 . It was on a little scrap of paper . " <P> Though a millionaire several times over by now , he lives with his wife and younger daughter ( their other daughter is at college in the East ) in a comparatively modest 13-room Colonial home in suburban Bloomfield Hills , and is active in Detroit area civic and charitable groups . He likes jazz and Big Band music , but has no hobbies . His close friends tend to come from outside the auto industry , and he has made a point of avoiding the social circles of " Mister Ford , " as lacocca and other Ford executives respectfully call their ruler . lacocca once explained , " I do n't want to be fired for something I said to Mister Ford over drinks at the 21 Club .
