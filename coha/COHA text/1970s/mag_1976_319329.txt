As the silvery Metroliner highballed through New Jersey , Jimmy Carter slumped deeper in his seat and tried to nap . His blue eyes closed , then flickered open , closed again and opened again . Finally Carter gave up and gazed blankly out the window , his brow furrowed more deeply than usual . He had just won three primaries , finished second in three others and picked up about 140 delegates - five times more than any other Democrat that week . It seemed a good week 's work , boosting his score in the primaries to 16 victories in 25 attempts and his delegate total by conservative measure to 865 , or about 60% of the votes that he needs for the nomination . <P> But Carter was troubled by a perplexing problem : despite the impressive arithmetic , pundits and party leaders were focusing on his series of primary losses . Even his much larger than expected totals in Arkansas ( 63% ) , Kentucky ( 60% ) and Tennessee ( 78% ) - which amount to home turf for a Southerner-could not make up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost Idaho to the state 's Democratic Senator , Frank Church , and Nevada to its favorite neighbor , California Governor Jerry Brown . <P> Thin Bench . Most damaging to Carter 's campaign was the setback in Oregon , where he had lost a once comfortable lead in the closing weeks to Church . Carter 's Oregon campaign manager , Tom Mackey , an advance man for Robert Kennedy in 1968 , ascribed the loss to insufficient campaigning and battle fatigue among the staffers caused by Carter 's strategy of entering every primary except West Virginia 's . Said Mackey : " I had the feeling that our people were running out of gas . With Bobby , the bench was very strong . The Carter cadre has always been thin . That 's becoming a problem now . " In contrast , Church campaigned vigorously as the man from next door and won with 34% of the vote to 27% for Carter . <P> At the same time , Brown , who finished third with 25% , mounted a frenzied , last-minute write-in campaign that appealed strongly to young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome , his third-place finish was a stunning achievement , demonstrating anew that he is the phenomenon of the late primaries . Brown won nine delegates ( to 14 for Church and eleven for Carter ) , but he is expected to capture a majority of California 's delegates on <P> June 8 , giving him a final total of about 200 . On the other hand , Church doubtless will add more delegates to his total of 48-particularly in Montana , where he was favored to win this week-but will probably finish far back in the running .
