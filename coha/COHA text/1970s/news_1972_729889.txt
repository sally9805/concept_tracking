txt The next " hurrmph ! " you hear will be Hubert H. Humphrey clearing his throat to announce once more that he is running for president . This puts him two up on Pat Paulsen , one up on Henry Clay , and dead even with Charles C. Pinkney . He has run so . often for either president or vice-president , they will retire his electoral count when he quits . In 1968 , the last time he ran , 36 out of 50 states voted against him . One of the 14 that did n't was Texas . But Texas Democrats , given their choice of a field of candidates that is beginning to be as crowded as a screen-pass play on a Sunday afternoon at Dallas Stadium , are leaning in a generally Humphrey direction . To lean , as most other states seem to be , at a Muskie angle is to come up in Texas with a knuckle rap squarely in the oil-depletion allowance . // By R. Norman Motheny , staff photographer Candidate Humphrey HHH brand in Texas *Humphrey , oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " explains veteran Texas political writer Jon Ford , " that Edmund S. Muslcie is out front and that he has the best chance of winning in other states . But he keePS flying in the face of the people of Texas and making statements antagon7 istic to Texas interests . / " A lot of Texans say if he keeps popping off , it 's going to make it hard for them to support him at all . The things he says about the oil industry being over-protected just do n't sit well here in Texas . " Texans agree : better the politics of the retread than politics that are slippery on the issue of oil . Senator Humphrey may not be as snappy as some of the new tires rolling around loose on the presidential stump , but he can be depended on , like grandma 's hominy grits . Fifteen years ago voting for Hubert Humphrey in Texas would have been as unthinkable as voting for Gen. Santa Anna . Hubert Humphrey was liberalism in America . It was n't enough that he was a co-founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent near-zero grades from most conservative graders of senators . He filed and marshaled the Civil-rights Act of 1964 through Congress , was the father of the Peace Corps , the Food for Peace program , and Medicare . Approved by Texans But then he became Texan Lyndon B. Johnson 's Vice-President in 1965 and took to articulating every conservative point of view in the Democratic Party . And by 1968 , like Lyndon , he was votable for in Texas . But because it is looking more every day as if Edmund Muskie may be nominated by the Democrats , there may be no Hubert HuMphrey to vote for in Texas this year : Right now in this state , Richard M. Nixon could " whump " any of the Democrats , even though Texas has voted Republican in only 3 out of the last 27 presidential elections  --  doing it for Dwight D. Eisenhower twice and Herbert Hoover once . Senator Humphrey would run Mr. Nixon the closest race in this state . That 's why , in Texas , Democrats are happy to see that Senator Humphrey believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and see us , hear ! "
