A CHORUS LINE <P> Conceived , choreographed and directed by MICHAEL BENNETT Music by MARVIN HAMLISCH Lyrics by EDWARD KLEBAN <P> In the American musical , dance has sketched a profile of the U.S. , both geographically and psychologically . There has been the rustic rondelay , a handholding , earth-stamping ritual testifying to the vernal purity of the prairie . There has been the subway serenade-urban jostle , excitement and speed . Always there has been the brassy audacity of a nation that flung railroads like dice across the breadth of a vast continent . <P> <P> And the solitary tremolo has also been heard , the soft-shoe shuffle , the wistful Tom Sawyerish scuffing of the stage boards that says Americans experience an isolating loneliness as if by the provenance of birth . <P> In A Chorus Line , Michael Bennett , who may be a direct descendant of Terpsichore , has added to the dance vocabulary of the U.S. musical . He has made dance a central theme as well as a supremely exhilarating act . The chorus line is his symbol of mass anonymity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emphasis equally distributed between team and work . Bennett distills one more element . Behind the faceless mass , there is a face ; behind the dazzling precision of the dance , there is a terrifying vulnerability , not the false step of a foot but the crippling fall of a psyche . In a chorus line each body is more or less equal in the eyes of the beholder , but each spirit is separate-an individual with hopes , fears and desires . <P> The structure of the show is that of the audition , the Spanish Inquisition of the theater . Unseen , speaking with the muffled voice of Kafka 's God , the casting director asks each of the potential finalists for an accounting of his life and his love for dance and the theater . These accounts are just as mawkish , banal , self-absorbed and dream-bent as would be those of any of the playgoers . They are redeemed by humor and honesty . <P> <P> Of these confessions , Sammy Williams ' is the most affecting ; he plays a boy who was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man caught his act as a drag queen . As anyone who saw Follies could guess , a Michael Ben nett dance takes the parade-ground drill of the Radio City Rockettes and raises it to a Platonic ideal . As a dancer-cumactress , Donna McKechnie is an un crowned star . But just to indicate the medals that the entire cast has earned , they have collectively appeared in 88 different productions , in which they have given a total of 37,095 performances . If they were polled , they might vote A Chorus Line as their finest two hours .
