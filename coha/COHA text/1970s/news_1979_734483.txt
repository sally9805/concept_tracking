Letters To the Editor : Now that the starvation in Cambodia is off the front pages , weg have a chance to reflect on our pollen/ toward the broader conflict there . Vietnam has overthrown the Cambodian Government and set up a satelliv2 regime . The United States and mast of the world have demanded that Vietnam cease and desist in this aggression and withdraw . ? By demanding that it withdraw completely and unconditionally , we present Vietnam with onlyr two op. dons : continue fighting or face the real prospect of a second P bl Pot re , gime , with its attendant /retaliation and renewed barbarity . And Vietnam 's ability to accede too ur demand is no more real than our ability to accede to Iran 's demands for return of the Shah . In both cases a government with a righteous cause is asking another government to make a decision it can not possibly make . Let 's give Vietnam a third option . Ask it to agree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than Pol Pot . This could be guaranteed in : ieveral ways . One possibility : station a U.N . peaceThe Better Approach To Malpractice Cases To the Editor : Your Dec. 1 news article about medical malpractice panels summarized the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Medical Malpractice Panels covering 1976 , 1977 and 1978 . A most important fact that . needs emphasis is that 66 percent of the cases acted upon by the panels were settled without trial . I was on the original Committee on Expert Medical Testimony of New York City 's Bar Association , whose report ( 1956 ) laid the foundation for the present system . Having also served on medical malpractice panels as they now function , 141m aware of this system 's great advantages to the public . The average ! time a judge and the legal and medical experts spend at a hearing Is one to two hours . This avoids the great expense of trials , requiring numerous personnel and consuming days crr weeks . The cost of such trials was not mentioned , but anyone who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great financial burden on the taxpayer . The difference can well run into many thousands of dollars , as well as long delays . It is also important for the public to realize that the physician and the lawyer in each case spend time prior to the hearings reviewing the evidence . This preparatory work , transportation costs involved in getting to a hearing and time spent at the hearing are given without charge as a public service . The experts serve as friends of the court and are not subject to the pressures that may influence witnesses who are ' paid to represent the plaintiff or the defendant . This it i a serious effort to provide the best possible , impartial judgments in a difficult field . It is true that the present system can be further improved , but a very important step has been t aken and should be supported by the ptriblic as well as members of both the logal and medical profession who seek efficiency and lustice in our legal system . IRVING S. WRIGHT , M.D. New York , Dec. 4 , 1979 Editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back from dbserving Narcissus Topics Dec. 6 you happened to notice who began the idea of anonymity for editors ? Could it have been that ancient editor who chopped down the trees , made paper from the pulp , ran down the street to gather the news , ran back to his office to write the story , set the type , inked the press , ran off the paper and then ran off himself to deliver it ? Could that be how editors ' anonymity started ? CAROLYN RUSHEFSKY Belle Harbor , N.Y. , Dec. 6 , 1979 keeping force and observers in the area and provide international supervision of the formation of a new government . More than one independent Cambodian nationalist leader exists to form such a government . Such arrangement could satisfy China 's desires for containment of Vietnamese and Soviet influence in the area . Any concern in Peking that this may lessen its prestige and credibility as a trustworthy ally could be alleviated if the nations of the world let it be known that China would be considered to have fulfilled its obligations as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam earlier this year . We must be careful in international diplomacy to ask governments only for decisions that are possible . Our present demand of Vietnam is not in that category . Asking it to agree to clear-cut international guarantees for Cambodia 's independence and neutrality can provide Vietnam with a real option , and it can satisfy all major national interests involved . EILEEN E. KRAUS Lecturer , Political . Science Ursinus College Collegeville , Pa. , Dec. 6 , 1979 To the Editor : I have a suggestion for the deposed Shah of Iran that might help solve his problem of sanctuary as well as this country 's embarrassing political dilemma . If the Shah is as wealthy as he is reputed to be , he need n't approach one // The New York Times / Dee . 15.197% country after another and ask for asylum . He could buy a country . There is , in fact , a very appropriate but inconspicuous country , far from Iran , that would probably do business with him on the right terms . The country is Nauru , located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Streets , " a reader suggests tax incentives for the installation of garbage compacting machines in commercial and residential buildings . This half-solution begs the question : How much longer can our society see disposability as a virtue ? Every day we discard as refuse many items which could be recycled as industrial raw materials or be used as fuel . New York could become a shining example of municipal activity to organize separate collections of materials . For instance , Monday could be devoted to newspapers ( for the benefit of Sunday Times readers ) ; Tuesday , glass ; Wednesday , aluminum ; Thursday , other metals ; Friday , plastics . Even kitchen waste could be collected separately and used for revitalizing agricultural lands exhausted by overproduction and chemical fertilizers . Tax incentives should be offered for investment in recycling equipment in the same way as they are given for solar energy projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , perhaps , there would no longer be a need for recycling centers around the city , struggling for a safe anchor in the sea of garbage which is at ? resent New York . FRANCESCA SPINNER New York , Dec. 6 , 1979 Will Commissars Succeed Ayatollahs ? To the Editor : Those of us who are fortunate enough to remain alive until the end of Iran 's " Islamic " revolution will have an excellent opportunity to judge the universal validity of a generalization put forth a century and . a quarter ago by Karl Marx . In an article of Dec. 12 , 1854 , in The New York Daily Tribune about the " religious conflict in Prussia , " Marx wrote : " All popular commotions , lurking in the background , are forced by the government to assume at first the mystical and almost uncontrollable form of religious movements . The clergy , on their part , allow themselves to be deceived by appearances , and , while they fancy they direct the popular passions for the exclusive benefit of their corporations against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unwilling tools of the revolution itself . " Will the ayatollahs be superseded by the commissars ? JOSEPH L. BLAU New York , Dec. 7 , 1979 million , giving it one of the highest per capita incomes in the world . But Nauru has a serious problem . Its income is derived from the export of phosphates , which are fast being depleted . They are expected to be nearly exhausted by 1990 . Nauru , therefore , will be in need of a benefactor to endow it after its phosphates are gone . For a reasonable endowment , one would suppose , the people of Nauru would be glad to entertain the proposition of providing the Shah with a sanctuary for life . The Nauruans need fear no reprisals since they maintain no diplomatic or other embarrassing relations with Iran . By way of assuring himself an occasional change of scenery and climate from his eight-square-mile equatorial homeland , . the Shah might also purchase one of the late Aristotle Onassis 's cast-off yachts , or a rough equivalent thereof , and sail the Seven Seas , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not permitted to land away from his home port , he could certainly find legions of strongly anti-Communist or oleaginous admirers who would be happy to navigate their own smaller yachts alongside and accept an invitation from the Shah to be wined and dined at his mess . What a boon this would be to the Shah , to the people of Nauru and to the world ! RuFuS E. MILES JR . Princeton , N.J. , Dec. 8 , 1979 Old Met ' Memories To the Editor : Congratulations to the Chemical Bank for taking Mrs. Richard Tucker 's suggestion to install plaques and memorabilia to commemorate the site of the original Metropolitan Opera . To a member of the Met ballet in the early 1940 's and to all of us who shared the nostalgia of the " Old Met " ? Caruso , Melba and other operatic immortals ? it is warming to know that some tangible evidence of its having existed is now visible . When I read the Times article . my heart sang . HORTENSE KESSLER GREEN Trenton , Dec. 4 , 1979 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high taxi fares and unsafe conditions on regular subway trains , particularly at night , do people realize that for $3.50 they can travel safely and comfortably from midtown to downtown Manhattan , Brooklyn and Queens , and vice versa , on the J.F.K. Express ? The train is not just for going to or returning from the airport , and using it to get to other destinations supports a service that is very much in the red . DOREEN S. HOWARD New York , Dec. 7 , 1979 A Third Option for Vietnam For the Shah , Perhaps an Island in the Pacific When a Divorced Spouse Needs a New Health Insurance Policy To the Editor : State laws designed to protect spouses who are in danger of losing their health insurance because of divorce are not as effective as the optimistic Nov. 16 article by Lawrence Van Gelder would suggest , for several reasons . First , these laws rarely mandate that the converted policy be comparable in coverage to the original one . A number of laws contain minimumcoverage provisions , but these often permit much lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies often pay the full semiprivate rate for hospitalization , but the New York State law deems a converted policy to be in compliance if the reimbursement for hospital room and board is $50 a day for 70 days . Anyone who has checked recently knows that it is not unusual for a hospital to charge $250 per day or more for a semiprivate room , making $50 a day not only not comparable but totally inadequate . Secondly , state laws leave the insurer free to charge much higher premiums than the original rate . Because converted-policy holders are often subject to greater morbidity than the original group , carriers frequently increase premiums substantially . Indeed , the costs of health insurance for a middle-aged divorced woman may be so high that only one who is suffering illness will consider it a good buy . Obviously this adverse selection leads to even higher cost in future years , and to a continuing decline in the number of relatively healthy women who buy the converted policy . Finally , the laws do not require the carrier to give timely notice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a specified period ( usually 30 to 60 days after the divorce ) . As a result , many people lose this opportunity . These are the principal reasons that state laws requiring conversion provide inadequate protection to divorced women . The situation is even worse in states where there are no required conversion opportunities . There , full insurance is often available only to those who pass a medical exam . The overall result is that unemployed divorced women almost everywhere are ? likely to be without any health insurance whatsoever . The Administration 's health insurance proposal would assure protection for all of them , as well as for widows , who are also usually without adequate conversion rights . EDITH U. FIERST U. S.
