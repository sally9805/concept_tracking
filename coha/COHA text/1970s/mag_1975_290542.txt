Scotland 's Bay City Rollers ? Who ? <P> If you do n't know , Sid Bernstein will tell you . Bernstein is a promoter , the man who staged the Beatles ' momentous Shea Stadium concert in New York a decade ago . " Just like ten years ago all over again , " he says . " I am not saying the Rollers are the new Beatles . I am saying that they are the biggest phenomenon since the Beatles . " <P> This week the Rollers will make their U.S. television debut on the kick-off of ABC 's new music-variety series Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell . The five-man band will appear from London via satellite doing three typical songs : Bye Bye Baby , its first big hit ; Give a Little Love , its current British chart buster ; Summer Love Sensation , a new item . Everybody is sure the Rollers will be sensational enough to be demanded back . The group will tour 15 cities in the U.S. between Thanksgiving and Christmas . Bernstein is already negotiating a Shea Stadium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LP has just been released on the Arista label . <P> Soft Rockers . " Is it a hype ? Is it a hope ? Or is it a Bicentennial gift from the old country ? " goes Cosell 's introduction for the Rollers . Cosell 's musical taste being on a par with his knack for objective sports reporting , it is likely that even he does not have the answers to those questions . What is known for sure about the Rollers is that they drive little girls wild . In the year and a half since they supplanted the Osmonds as the favorites of youthful Britain , weeping , squealing and screaming have been big things at their concerts . So has fainting . At a concert in London last May , 250 or so young things were treated on the scene and another 28 hauled off to a hospital . <P> Rollers is the British word for soft rockers . That accounts for one part of the group 's name . Its collective eye on the American market , the Rollers stuck a pin in a map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Onstage , the boys-Alan and Derek ( Longmuir ) , Les ( McKeown ) , Eric ( Faulkner ) and Woody ( Stuart Wood ) - are the ultimate squeaky cleans . They claim not to drink . Only one admits to smoking , and then only cigarettes . At their press conferences , a pitcher of milk is always conspicuous on a table front and center . Their personal promotion describes them as just working-class lads from Edinburgh . That turns out to be true . <P> It all began seven years ago when the Longmuir brothers , Bass Guitarist Alan , then 19 , and Drummer Derek , then 16 , started a rock group called the Saxons . They rehearsed in their parents ' tenement apartment . " They had the most patched-up bunch of electronic junk I 'd ever seen , " says Tam Paton , their manager . They also had , he recalls , " a freshness and an eagerness to please that were very appealing . " A perhaps marketable , boy-next-door look , in other words . <P> For three years they worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night . Then one day in 1970 a record-company executive missed his flight back to London and dropped in at the Caves Club . The Rollers were playing . Almost immediately , the Rollers had a contract , and began turning out such British top-ten hits as Remember , Shang-a-Lang and All of Me Loves You .
