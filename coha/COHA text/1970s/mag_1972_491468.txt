// N ' C vilsa What ever chased those long lines away from the movie box offices ? Depravity , to begin with . Nudies and lewdies . And when they became clich6s , profanity set in . If degeneracy has its boring point , merely gutter the lingo . Some of our current movies scorch us with expressions so foul they make a mule skinner 's blue thunderings sound like Little Eva 's prayers . And tough talk triggers tougher action . The brutal , bloody screen cycle burst forth successfully with Bonnie and Clyde and The Wild Bunch , climaxed in The Godfather , and anticlimaxed in a recent shooting gallery called Slaughter . But , you ask , are n't those superviolent films successful ? No  --  only a few have been . Has n't the burgeoning nude-lewd-crude syndrome hypoed the box office ? No . It has nearly killed it . As nudity and lewdness first shocked , then disgusted , then bored movie audiences , just so will blood and guts and kill-happy Robin Hoods ( both white and black ) first shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or black ) . Hollywood 's Daily Reporter published some ominously revealing charts a few months ago . One chart indicated that in the peak movie-attendance year of 1947 ? when the Production Code was still operative and the film hero was still in vogue-100 million patrons went to movie theaters each week . En the 50 's , when the Code was cracked , and the non-hero was " in , " weekly attendance slid off to 60 million . In the 60 's , the decade of permissiveness and the anti-hero , weekly ticket buyers dwindled to 40 million . And as of the summer of ' 72 , fewer than 20 million patrons per week went to the movies . The advent of television undoubtedly affected movie box offices in the 50 's . But in the 60 's and 70 's , pornography and brutality were the plagues that reduced weekly attendance from 60 to 20 million . Which means that in the last fifteen years , two out of ) . every three movie-goers stopped seeing films . And if we take population increase into account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers are staying away from movie houses . Will the box office ever pick up again ? I have reason to believe it will . During the past year , I have shown my old films and held seminars in a score of universities and colleges  --  chores that might constitute a minor miracle considering Academia 's intransigence toward the American film . For , incredible as it may seem , and despite the fact that most foreign nations have long since grafted film on to their national culture ( in some nations it is now the heart of their culture ) ; despite film 's invention by an American ( Edison ) , and its elevation to an art form by another American ( Griffith ) ; despite the fact that film has for six decades been our Number One salesman for American goods and ideas , the lowly " Hollywood product " has never been admitted into the inner sanctums of the artistic and intellectual Brahmans who rule in Boston , New York , and Washington . In their rarified circles , Hollywood is still a bad word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of collegians . They grew up with the audiovisual mystique of films and television . They dig it , want to express themselves in it . Their pressure has pushed campus administrators into grudgingly widening their curricula to include film studies . So Film , the Dead End Kid of American arts , has finally crashed the ivy-walled basilicas of the cap and gown . There they are , all looking up at me  --  the faces of film students ; a balanced mixture of sexes , colors , and hirsute caprices . Like the faces of those brilliant , confident , cocky postgraduates at Yale Law College ; the faces of younger , more emotional , highly volatile students at Columbia ; the pink-fresh , acne-hued , down-fuzzed prep school faces at Kent School , and the exclamation-point faces of the feverishly excited ten-year-old moppets who had just seen Mr. Smith Goes To Washington at a Quaker elementary school in Philadelphia . And here I am again , holding daily student seminars at the Atlanta Film Festival , or at the University of Nevada . The faces are everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awed but eager with expectation . And I rejoice and thank the Almighty for the privilege of sharing with our young the bold vigor of their enthusiasms and the raw riches of their minds . From experience , I know that sonic will be serious about films , some will not . The great majority of the serious-minded will be vague , if not apprehensive , about their future . Some expect to become instant writers or instant directors . Others will want assurance that film courses will lead to film jobs . One or two bolder ones will ask the question that bugs them all : " What is the secret to film success ? " And do I reveal the mysteries , or astound with words of wisdom at these seminars ? Well , no . To paraphrase Professor McLuhan , my presence is my message . I 'm short , unprepossessing , a son of illiterate peasants . I let them know I 'm the kind that ca n't get waited on in restaurants . And so they look at me and say to themselves , " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a helluva chance ! " Having thus reached a common level where communicating is easier and friendlier , my answers to their apprehensive questions are worldly , professional . I " tell it like it is . " I remind them that film is a creative art , not an acquired discipline . And though all are born with certain capacities and certain abilities , only our abilities can be sharpened and improved with schooling . Creative capacities , however , are gifts of birth . Schooling can uncover but not teach them . I also remind them that there are no formulas or arcane short cuts to creative success . If there were , all films would be hits , because no filmmaker starts out to make a bad film . No , sir . Into the making of each film , whether it hits or flops , dozens of enthusiastic talents let it all hang out  --  blood , sweat , hopes , minds , hearts , money . And if the project fails  --  nine out of ten do  --  it merely proves that films are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this time we darken the theater and show the students one of my films : It Happened One Night ; Mr. Deeds ; Mr. Smith ; or Lost Horizon , or You Ca n't Take It With You . Most of them have never seen these films . Their impact on young audiences of today is amazingly similar to their audience impact of thirty-five years ago . If anything , today 's impact has more clout  --  especially on the young women . For invariably some still-sniffling gal will blurt out , " I 've never laughed and cried so much at any film before . " And , " Why do n't they make films like that today ? " Out of the banter and heat of " questions and answers , " we find that philosophies , ideals , and caveats emerge . The first questions are about my philosophy of filmmaking and , " How are you able to mix comedy and serious themes in one film ? " To answer such questions , of course , is why I 'm there . Quoting freely from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what comedy means to me . Comedy is fulfillment , accomplishment , . overcoming . It is victory over odds , a triumph of good over evil . Tragedy is frustration , failure , despair . Evil prevails . Comedy is good news : " How beautiful are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings ... " The Gospels are comedies : a triumph of spirit over matter . The Resurrection is the happiest of all endings : man 's triumph over death . It is a divine comedy . In social terms , comedy is a complete surrender of one 's defenses . If you do n't like a person , if he acts superior , or if you fear him  --  your defenses are up . You wo n't laugh , with him or at him . Enemies , strangers , the sarcastic , the fearful , the ugly , the dangerous , the unknown  --  no laughs . But you laugh easily among friends ; you love them ; your defenses are down . And you la ugh easily among innocents ; babies , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a lion cub  --  innocence . You do n't laugh at his father  --  fear . Your defenses are up . Furthermore , comedy is so tantalizingly fragile that we ca n't will it into being . Something pleasant , comic , or witty must trigger it . Why ? We do n't know . Comedy defies analysis . But we all somehow know that wit , humor , laughter are the hope , the promise , the sunlight , the flavor , the perfumes that enliven the days of our pilgrimage on this earth . And because my Films are upbeat and optimistic , comedy is my natural ploy for defending the tragic . My philosophy of filmmaking ? ( 1 ) To exalt the worth of the individual . ( 2 ) To stress that every human being is born unique  --  unlike any other person that has ever been born or ever will be born . ( 3 ) To champion man  --  plead his causes , protest any degradation of his dignity , spirit , or divinity . Because be he saint or sinner , rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , genius or retarded , basket case or pole-vaulter , each is of a piece with his Maker . Pat the head of a child , you are patting God ; slay a man , you are murdering Goodness . And ( 4 ) to dramatize the viability of the individual  --  as in the theme of Mr. Deeds : A simple , honest man , driven into a corner by predatory sophisticates , can , if he will it , reach down into his God-given resources and come up with the necessary handfuls of courage , wit , and love to triumph over his environment . Amazingly enough , my concern for the John and Jane Does of the world strikes responsive chords in the hearts of film students whether they attend UCLA in California , York University in Toronto , or Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond . It 's the kind of idealistic " something " youth is yearning to latch on to . A warm feeling comes over me as I sense in our students a renaissance of faith ; a reaching for the clean , the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the meaning and worth of their own existence . And I sense they are being turned off by smut , brutality , cynicism , and hedonism , and turned on by that small inner voice which whispers , " Only that which is good , decent , compassionate , and beautiful puts meaning into your life . All else is vanity . " So I urge film students to get off the smut kick . Get smart enough and committed enough to use the new permissiveness to dig deeper into the human heart , as well as into human vices . Because one of the secrets of success is to realize that sacrificial love is the major ingredient of the great classics , and that in films love has always been , and always will be , the most potent of all box-office magnets . Witness the magic of one touch of love in Midnight Cowboy , how it ennobled and cleansed two sordid , revolting characters  --  a male whore and a slimy pimp . Without that redeeming bit of sentiment , Midnight Cowboy could never have won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tickets . Then , as the students warm to the subject , I lean hard on the following points : Film students must always keep in mind that of all human Life-drives , Love is the purest , deepest , most universal . So majestic is Love , so powerful , so right , that we equate it with Divinity . Take note of John 's electrifying metaphor : God is Love . And if the moment seems apropos , I repeat the trenchant observation a pretty airline stewardess made while we were discussing our deplorable lack of new female film stars . " How can Hollywood develop new women stars when you treat them like cattle in your films ? " the lovely one remarked . " You undress women , exploit their bodies like sideshow freaks ; you buy them , sell them , beat them , kick them around ; you rape them , gang-rape them , and leave them to die like dogs . Jeepers ! The one thing you should do you do n't do . " " And what 's that ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women like to be loved , you know . Or is that news in Hollywood ? " And now that we know each other better , some student invariably asks , " Will the movie-going public ever fill up the theaters like they used to ? " My reply is that there are always large audiences ready to line up for films they want to see . It 's the smut and brutality that disgust them and make them stay away . And I express my belief that the general public will once again drive that extra mile to see fine films  --  just as soon as pornographers and quick-buck hucksters pack up their obscenities and creep back into their cellars ; and just as soon as young filmmakers mature enough to realize their awesome power , and even more awesome responsibilities  --  to themselves , their art , and especially to the hundreds of millions they can speak to in the dark , and for two hours . " What should these ' fine films , ' that the public will drive an extra mile for , be about ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should sing the songs of the working stiffs , the short-changed Joes , the poor , the afflicted , and the pushed-around because of race or birth . " Someone should remind man that he is born of the sun and water , of vivid air and the smells of earth ; that he is born free , divine , strong ; uncrushable by fate , society , or hell itself ; that he is a child of God , equal heir to all the bounties of God ; and that goodness is riches , kindness is power , and freedom is glory . " " But who will make the films of tomorrow ? " The great films are yet to come . They will be made by the youth of today ; the youth in grade schools , high schools , and universities who are " learning their scales " by filming little scenes with their cameras . Film is their hag . They grew up with it , dig it , and will create directly for it , rather than borrow . In closing , I wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my part to reestablish some form of government or industry censorship . Far , far from it , I trust the people . I trust the natural censorship of the box office . And the people have spoken : " We are too decent to accept pornography as art , too compassionate to accept brutality as a way of life , and too hep to be more than occasionally suckered in by fast-buck creeps . And you film guys may as well know that we 've had it up to here with your corrupting garbage . " But censorship by Codes or statutes ? Never . Art is not art unless it is free . Censorship is forced conformity . A free artist is about the only paladin left who can save man from mass conformity . The intuition of an artist is the Gift of the Magi . He knows the worth and divinity of each man , woman , and babe . He knows that the first cry of the newborn is the rebel yell of the individual . He knows that the strong may raise hell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own way , but that only the compassionate and the honest will forever be our folk heroes . Therefore .. .
