The Iran Crisis <P> To the Editors : <P> Be careful , Khomeini Dec. 3 ! You may have awakened a sleeping giant . <P> Rob Hammel <P> San Bruno , Calif . <P> The U.S. has turned up its share of religious fanatics , but has yet to deliver a despot or dictator . It seems that Iran has the knack of delivering both . Certainly , no nation is perfect , though I ca n't think of any nation that tries harder than the U.S. to air and solve its problems , and thereby give a lead to others . We do n't turn to Iran or Uganda for solutions to world problems , do we ? <P> Bruce Morley <P> Auckland , N.Z. <P> Let us hope that the U.S. will never bow to Khomeini 's blackmail . If the Carter Administration agrees to Iranian demands , it will be a blow and a very bad example to those who love democracy . <P> H. Sarhan Salem <P> Sharjah , United Arab Emirates <P> The Oilatullah is not a madman . A madman would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Panama City <P> The explosion of anti-Americanism in Iran may be only the beginning . The Shahs , Somozas , Parks and Marcoses of the world have left an angry mob of people who blame the U.S. support of these dictators for years of oppression . The sins of a shallow foreign policy are coming back to haunt us all . <P> Timothy T.

" Actually , there have been five , since you omitted my old friend and Foreign Service colleague , Frank Meloy , Ambassador to Lebanon , who was killed in Beirut on June 16,1976 . <P> It is little realized that our Foreign Service is our true first line of defense , or how often those front-line persons suffer casualties . <P> Claiborne Pell U.S. <P> Senator , Rhode Island <P> Washington , D.C. <P> Understanding Death <P> Your article on teaching children about death Dec. 3 brought back some memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We visited graveyards and funeral homes . We also wrote our feelings about death . At the time we thought it trivial and a bit morbid . But this past summer a classmate died . Through our understanding of death we were able to cope and somehow adjust to the fact that we would never see our friend again . <P> Leticia Toledo <P> Walnut Creek , Calif . <P> The Gainesville children 's class on death would have learned a lot more had they visited one of our Wisconsin families . After they lost their young child , they made the casket , performed the service , and with friends buried their child on his grandparents ' farm . <P> Rochelle Whiteman <P> Milwaukee <P> The Fifty-Fifty Plan <P> A recent TIME summary of the economic and energy positions of 1980 presidential candidates Dec. 3 dismisses the field as " producing no ideas that seem much different " from President Carter's.
