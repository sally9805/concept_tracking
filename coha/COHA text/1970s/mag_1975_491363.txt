At first glance , the camel appears to be one of nature 's heartier jokes : clumsy and stupid , coldhearted and lazy , sunk in impenetrable gloom , emanating repellent odors , emitting frightful noises and , with the vilest of tempers , maddening to train and agonizing to ride , given to biting the hand that feeds it . It is certainly no beauty either . Seven or eight feet tall and ten feet long , its 1,500 pounds packed mostly into its middle . hump-backed , barrel-bellied , thick-lipped , spindle-thanked , knockkneed and flat-footed , it is said to look like a horse invented by a committee . Yet , upon closer examination the camel reveals itself as one of the Creator 's chosen creatures . Most of its behavioral attributes are based on long-standing misconceptions and even its looks , admittedly not ingratiating , add up to a marvel of anatomical engineering . The Bedouin of Arabia call it " Ata Allah " ? God 's Gift  --  and for people living in the arid regions covering about one-sixth of the earth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and means of transport is a pearl beyond price . And it is still a pearl , even in this age of the combustion engine : Trucks get mired in the sand , camels do n't . But by no means is it a rare one . Today Pakistan has almost a million camels , double its total twenty years ago ; India , close to a million and a half ; Ethiopia has another million ; Somalia and the Sudan three million camels apiece . Counting others in northern and central Africa , Afghanistan , Mongolia , Russia , China , and the Middle East , the worldwide camel population stands at around fifteen million today and is rising . Seldom has nature turned out a living creature so perfectly suited to the improbable place it calls home . To anybody but a camel , the Sahara Desert or Saudi Arabia 's Empty Quarter looks Iike hell on earth , an unending landscape of shifting dunes and stony rubble baking under a pitiless sun , where rain seldom falls and almost nothing grows . Camels amble over this appalling wasteland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even months . It is n't long before a traveler who happens to be with them at such times learns to love them . For true desert-dwellers , the camel is as dear as life itself . " It is not hunger or thirst that frightens the Bedouin , " writes explorer Wilfred Thesiger , who crossed the Empty Quarter twice on camelback . " It is the possible collapse of their camels that haunts them . If that happens , death is certain . " It is when the going gets really rough that the camel comes into its own . Last summer , for example , when torrential rains finally came to the drought-stricken Sahelian desert zone of west-central Africa and road communications were severed , large numbers of inhabitants in isolated communities were in danger of starvation . With American financial aid 2,000 camels were mobilized to transport 5,000 tons of food into the interior , and countless lives were saved . In India 's Rajasthan Desert , too , the army still uses camels where the terrain is too difficult for even a Land Rover . Already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camel highly . Job , described in the Old Testament as " the greatest of all men of the East , " had 3,000 camels among his assorted livestock . Rebekah was singled out by Abraham 's emissary as a wife for Isaac because she thoughtfully watered the emissary 's ten camels . ( Since camels , given the chance , can be heavy drinkers  --  they can toss down a good bathtub full of water after a hard day 's ride  --  Rebekah must have hauled up some 250 gallons from the well for those camels . Any girl willing and able to do that plainly deserved to become " the mother of thousands of millions . " ) King Solomon built a fabulous fortune on trade with the Arabs as far south as Sheba using camel caravans . When the sons of Reuben , " valiant men ... able to wear buckler and sword and shoot with a bow , " made war on the Hagarites , they walked off the battlefield with 50,000 camels as their trophy . It was in the fourth century A.D. that camels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African Maghreb , changing the course of history . With the " ships of the desert , " trade was possible at last across the immense wilderness sealing off black Africa from the Maghreb , the Mediterranean , Europe , the Orient . Over the next 1,500 years , great camel caravans came down from the north across the Sahara to Timbuktu and Agades , bringing glass beads from Venice , cotton from Manchester , silk from France , salt , spices , swords , perfumes , gunpowder . Back from the south came kola nuts , ostrich feathers , slaves , and gold . Throughout these fabled years , the camel gave mastery over half the African continent to the Tuaregs and other tribes . In their enormous desert realm , these camel-owning nomads had the speed and mobility to plunder , raid for slaves and exact tribute at will from settled farmers . Their dominance over the desert lasted until 1902 , when the French colonial forces finally beat them at their own game  --  by forming a Saharan Camel Corps . Camels were even tried out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Jefferson Davis when he was Secretary of War in 1851 , a time when Westward-migrating settlers badly needed better communication , transport and protection by Federal troops from Apache raids . Having noted the similarities between the American Southwest and the camel 's traditional habitat . Davis obtained congressional appropriation of $30,000 to import camels from Egypt and Asia Minor . The first thirty camels bore up without flinching under eighty-eight days at sea and a harrowing 400-mile journey overland from Powder Horn , Texas to Zuni , New Mexico . Wherever the camels went , however , the very whiff of them had horses and mules rearing and whinnying in panic . As Herodotus had noted centuries before , " the horse has a natural dread of the camel and can not abide either sight or smell of him . " Regretfully , in a country as committed to the equine as our West , Davis 's experiment had to be abandoned . Paradoxically , it was in North America forty million years ago that the camelidae family got started . At that time the camel was the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the family had grown appreciably in stature , developed six branches , and migrated around the globe . The smaller sheep-sized relatives settled in South America , the wild vicuna and guanaco on the plateaux of the high Andes , the llama and alpaca below . Their camel-sized cousins wandered westward across the land-bridge between Alaska and Siberia , later flooded by the waters of the Bering Straits . The two-humped bactrian , heavy-set and hairy , headed for cold regions ; fewer than 50,000 of its descendants today live from Lake Baikal in Siberia to the bleak breezy steppes of central China . The taller and faster one-humped dromedary ( whose name comes from the Greek dromas. runner ) chose Arabia 's burning sands and thereby achieved a measure of immortality  --  in more ways than one . Everything about the camel is exquisitely designed to fit him to his hellish habitat . The eyes , a camel 's only true beautiful feature , are double-lashed in a heavy fringe to screen out blowing sand . The ears and nostrils can close up tight for the same reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shins , are splayed and padded , the better to move over sand without sinking . The tough , rubbery lips can nibble at thorns spiky enough to puncture shoe leather and are so good at food gathering that a camel never has to lose other precious moisture by sticking his tongue out . The food is then pushed back and forth through four stomach chambers : the system not only extracts nourishment from the unlikeliest sources but leaves very little waste . ( One result is exceptionally dry dung , which burns beautifully for cooking a nomad 's dinner . ) A camel also has an extremely small urine output hardly a third of a donkey 's . While most animals are poisoned if they can not urinate enough to expel waste urea , the camel can recycle much of his urea through the liver to make new protein . At one stroke , he is thereby ahead on both food and water . While on the move camels will eat things in the name of food that few living creatures would look at twice . Indeed , rich food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What keeps the dromedary well and happy is a frugal diet of desert salt bush , spiky thorns , sun-baked acacia leaves , and other uninspiring sand dune delights . The one 1 rode in the West African Sahel had a weakness for parched straw . If they 're hungry enough , they 'll eat anything in sight from the thatched roof of an African but and an old tent or saddle to plastic sheeting and copper wire . On nonfood like that and next to no water , a camel can go on working for thirty or forty years in the pink of condition . Apart from mange or the megrims , most of them never know what it is to be sick . They do n't even seem to know what pain is . One account of Britain 's Northwest Frontier Wars describes three camels who were struck by rifle bullets . The first was shot in the head , which he shook once or twice ; the second through the hump , at which he made a snap ; the third in the rump , to which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camel can outrun and outlast a horse at long distances , or carry loads that would kill an ox . Where the ox 's limit is 200 pounds , a camel thinks nothing of carrying three or four times that , and can manage half a ton in a pinch . Unloaded , it can run ten miles an hour for eighteen hours at a stretch , and finer breeds  --  the Tuaregs ' Mehari or Chinese Fongkyo Fo , " camel with feet of wind " ? are faster yet . What 's more , a camel can keep it up long after a horse would fall in its tracks . In Australia , at the turn of the century , a camel was raced against a horse over a 110-mile course . The horse won , by a hair , and dropped dead . The camel , after a good night 's sleep , did the 110 miles back the next day in the same time . The camel 's most legendary feature is its little need for water . Though dromedaries are sup-posed to be watered every three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been known to hold out much longer . In 1883 , an Australian surveyor named Charles Winnecke crossed a rug-ged desert with a train of dromedaries , each laden with 700 pounds of baggage , which cov-ered 278 miles in sixteen days under a scorching sun without a drink . A couple of years later , several dozen camels accompanying another Australian exploring team did 510 miles in thirty-four days , with no more than four gallons of water each . Just what the camel does do about water has always been the big mystery . Pliny the Elder first suggested that the camel must have some kind of interior storage tank . Some thought it was the hump , others an extra stomach , and folk tales are still told of desert travelers saved from a hideous death by cutting a camel open to get at one or the other . Today we know that there is no cavity inside the camel to store pure water . The question was settled once and for all twenty years ago by Knut Schmidt-Nielsen , a physiologist from Duke University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first definitive study  --  still by far the most authoritative  --  of the re-markable anatomical design of the camel . Schmidt-Nielsen discovered that the camel has not one mechanism but a dozen  --  including a built-in thermostat and refrigeration  --  to make the best of what water it gets . Low urine output is one way . Another is the hump , where fat equal to a fifth of the body weight is stored , to be drawn on when there is nothing else to eat . Thus the fat does n't have to be distributed elsewhere and body heat can therefore escape through the rest of the surface skin more easily , keeping perspiration down . At the same time , outside heat is reflected by a thick coat of hair which insulates the skin . ( Wherever I 've gone in the desert , I 've seen nomads muffled to the eyes in loose camel-hair robes as though setting out on an Arctic expedition , who obviously felt a lot cooler than I did . ) Another striking feature is that a dromedary 's temperature can fluctuate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only 2 degrees  --  to avoid heavy sweating . A man keeps his temperature constant by sweating , which begins as soon as his body temperature rises by morethan a fraction of one degree , using up his body water irretrievably . The camel 's body heat may drop to 93 degrees F. at night and rise to 105 degrees on a very hot day , before sweating sets in . If it is not working too hard and has good grazing , a camel can get all the water it needs from the moisture in its food , and hold out without a drink as long as ten months , In emergencies it can always fall back on a kind of savings account unique in nature : it can take what it needs directly from its own body tissues , losing up to a quarter of its body weight in water without being weakened seriously . After thus losing about 250 pounds of water , the camel 's bones may stick out of its rib cage as if in the final stages of starvation . But one good long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . It is a churlish desert-dweller who would mind putting up ? with a few eccentricities in so gifted a creature . All the same , the camel is inarguably an eccentric . There is , first , the question of how to get on one . What with its seven-foot height , a barrel girth and hump , a camel can not simply be mounted while upright , like a horse . It must be persuaded to sit down , with its broad chest touching the ground and long knobby legs tucked up under it . The rider then approaches circumspectly from the rear and leans forward to catch the saddle tree with his left hand while placing his left knee in the saddle . While the rider scrambles aboard , the camel 's hind quarters begin to rise like a runaway elevator . This opens up its forelegs at the knees , and it sways backward until one of its front legs can straighten out . Placing that front footpad firmly on the ground for leverage , it can then straighten out the other leg . That done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sickening motion . The Australian writer Ernestine Hill says : " When the camel stands up , it 's an aeroplane in a tailspin . " Once on its feet , the camel 's peculiar gait can he torment for a novice . Walking with both right legs , then both left , it proceeds with an unconventional rocking movement which seemed to me on my first ( and second , and third ) camel ride to have been invented with demonic skill for my discomfort . Opinions differ as to how much easier the riding may get with experience . But under certain circumstances , even the best of riders must he on the alert . Head a camel up a steep sand dune , for instance , and it goes down on its front knees to waddle up with its load , pushing with its back legs and squirming on its knees . At the top , it doubles its hack legs , stiffens its front ones and careens down like a toboggan . Still , a seasoned rider can not only enjoy himself on a camel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camel market on the Niger River not long ago , i saw Tuaregs riding in from the bush at exhilarating speed , bareback , their legs straight out before them on the camel 's elongated neck , obviously having a glorious time . In Saudi Arabia 's Great Nafud Desert , during the Aid al-Adha Moslem holidays , thousands of people flock to the yearly nine-mile camel race to watch a hundred camels thunder across the desert at full gallop , their riders sitting as graceful and light as continued from page 90 jockeys on thoroughbreds . Lawrence of Arabia wrote of riding a camel called Ghazala , " vaulted and huge-ribbed as an antique ship , towering a good foot above the next of our animals and yet perfectly proportioned , a lyrical beast with a stride like an ostrich 's . " While on the move , a camel does its job efficiently and silently . At almost any other time , though , its repertory of noises is extraordinary . The camels I have met around the African sub-Sahara and India 's Rajasthan Desert have kept me awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snorting , bleating , snarling , grunting , and a kind of gargle . This does n't necessarily reflect the state of a camel 's temper , generally much more equable than it sounds . Lady camels especially are reasonable , manageable , even sedate . Males , too , can be handled quite easily most of the time , except for three or four months of the year , when the mating instinct is upon them . Then they become hysterically nervous , foaming at the mouth , with eyes inflamed , and may savage anyone in sight without warning , biting off a man 's arm or kneecap or killing him outright . " A camel in rut simply goes berserk , " I was told by Dr. G.D . Sharma , Research Director of the Bikaner Camel Farm in Rajasthan . The inconvenience and risk are too muchfor many camel owners , who will simply not have a bull camel around the house , though when not sexually distracted , the males are able to work much harder . For a sizable minority of farmers and herdsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erratic behavior , however , may only be a reaction to his overwhelming frustration , one of the unkinder arrangements nature has wrought . She-camels , for one , are in the mood for love only four or five days a year , and that not every year . Further , a male camel crazed by sexual desire is his own worst enemy , very nearly incapable of mounting a receptive female . The lady is meek and willing , demanding little more than a show of interest on her future husband 's part , in the form of a black fetid fluid excreted on the back of his neck and a giant pink air sac blown from the side of his mouth like an outsized wad of bubble gum , sucked in again with a loud slobbering noise . Once she is in a couched position , however , the bull camel straddles his lady clumsily , " a comic figure of ill-directed lust , " as one expert puts it . A baby camel 's survival seems just as precarious as its awkward conception . A newborn camel  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other year , after a pregnancy lasting over twelve months  --  is the most helpless creature imaginable . Enchantingly soft and furry , it is at first so utterly helpless that it can barely get at its mother 's teats for milk . For the first year of its life , a camel remains heavily dependent on its mother ; only when fully grown can it be trained and put to work . According to members of the Bikaner Camel Farm staff , training is easy , provided it is done correctly . The usual method is to insert a nose plug , attached to lead strings which must he tugged judiciously : too weak a tug will make no impression , whereas too strong a jerk might tear through the nostrils , not only turning the camel loose but likely to put him into a towering rage . Apart from lust , mishandling is the one thing that can turn this phlegmatic creature into a manic killer . " One of our trainers here irritated a camel once by inserting its nose plugs ineptly , and the camel never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Every time the trainer got anywhere near that camel , it went for him , until he finally had to quit his job . " A camel will seek revenge however long it takes , hunting out its enemy , flinging him to the ground , and crunching his skull between iron jaws or crushing him to death beneath its weight . " There are camels around here who have spotted a mean-minded raika ( camel driver ) in somebody 's car and chased the car right through town , " Dr. Sharma recalled . Yet , if accorded due respect , there is almost no limit to what a camel will stand for . Showing marvelous forbearance , it will struggle without complaint over terrible terrain in unspeakable climates until it literally falls dead in its tracks , whether drawing a plough or pulling a heavy cart or carrying an enormous load on its back . A patient trainer , furthermore , can teach a camel to do all sorts of things surprising in so allegedly stupid an animal . My friends in Bikaner told me of camels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a band at marriages and village fairs . Other camels have been taught to smoke and have even become addicts , willing to walk a mile for a fix . Often one will nip over to nudge its owner imperiously when he pulls out a pack of cigarettes . Many camel owners treat their animals not only with respect , but affection . In Mauritania , I saw a camel nearly knock his owner over when he came up to give the man a fond nudge before retiring . In Gaddiwala , a small Indian village near Bikaner , the signs of mutual friendship and trust were all around me . " We love them and they love us , " said a farmer there whose ten-year-old son cares for the family 's four camels . " If we 've been away , when we return they come up close and sniff , to show how they 've missed us . We do n't even have to tie them up . My son has only to call , and they 'll come . Ask him , and you 'll see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In families like these , two generations can count on the same camel to serve them for ploughing , hauling water from the well , carrying whatever they grow to market or , in the deep desert , carrying wives , children and baggage over hundreds of miles from one watering place to the next . Every day a she-camel can give them a gallon or two of milk much richer than a cow 's  --  the milk has an exceptionally high fat and vitamin content , and she will continue to give it for at least three years after bearing  --  often the nomads ' only food . Every year the camel sheds hair to keep its owners in robes , rugs and blankets ( as well as replenish the wardrobes of the international jet set ) . Even in death , the camel continues to serve , its hide used for tents and its flesh for meat . Yet it is for something more than the sum of all these parts that a Bedouin raising a calabash of camel 's milk to drink will often say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of years between man and this beast , each has learned to overlook the faults of the other . And those of us living amongst bucking taxis , lumbering buses and noisome subways may well cast an envious eye at the Bedouin , blessed as he is with one of nature 's wonders , the eamellt It is much easier to form good habits than to reform bad ones .
