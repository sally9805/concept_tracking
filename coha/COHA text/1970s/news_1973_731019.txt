txt This week 's series of record-breaking auctions at Sotheby Parke Bernet indicated that while the art boom may be tapering off in some areas , it is spilling over into others . In setting significant new records , Picasso and surrealist painters overshadowed the impressionists , and contemporary American art conclusively entered the big-money scene . Highlight of the week was the muchpublicized sale of 50 contemporary American works from the collection of Robert Scull . Mr. Scull , who owns a taxicab fleet , is a man of uncanny foresight whose patronage of living and sometimes unknown American artists and purchases of their works during the ' 50 's and ' 60 's played a major role in establishing abstract expressionism and pop art as national art movements . It was felt throughout the art world that this sale would provide a crucial index of the market for contemporary American art . New auction record In the sale of works by such outstanding artists as Jasper Johns , Robert Rauschenberg , Andy Warhol , Barnett Newman , Franz Kline , William de Kooning , and Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new record for an auction sale of contemporary American art was set at $2,242,900 . The show-stopper in the evening 's drama , attended by a teeming horde of leading New York and European dealers and collectors , was Johns 's painting , " Double White Map . " It fetched a price of $240,000 from Ben Heller , the New York collector who recently sold Jackson Pollack 's " Blue Poles " for $2 million , and set four records : for a Johns painting ( previously a reported $150,000 private purchase ) , for a living American artist ( previously $120,000 for a Georgia O'Keeffe ) , for a 20th-century work of American art ( previously $220,000 for a Yasuo Kuniyoshi ) , and for a pop work ( previously $75,000 for a Roy Lichtenstein ) . It missed by a mere $10,000 equaling the auction record for any American work of art . ( It should be borne in mind that these are auction records only and do not reflect prices paid in private transactions . ) Johns also broke his own record with the painting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone for $125,000 , and the record for a sculpture by a living American artist with " Painted Bronze , " which drew a winning bid of $90,000 from a German dealer . De Kooning 's " Police Gazette " set a new record for an abstract expressionist work at $180,000 , thanks to a European dealer , followed by Barnett Newman 's " White Fire II " at $155,000 , the only work purchased by an acknowledged museum , the Kunst Museum in Basel , Switzerland . Other artists who broke their previous records were de Kooning , Kline , Rauschenberg , Larry Poona , James Rosenquist , Cy Twombly , Lucas Samaras , Tom Wesselman , and notably Warhol , whose 13%-foot-wide painting , " Flowers , " was plucked by a European collector for $135,000 . This high bid elicited one of the few rounds of feeble applause from an audience apparently benumbed by the plunderous proceedings . // *American art boom // There is an incredibility to auctions such as this that tends to dull reactions both to price and to art . The purchases were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German ) and the Amer , icans ( the Marlborough , Leo Castelli , and Denise Rene Galleries ) . The Japanese , who bought heavily at the Halpert auction of early 20th century American art last spring and constitute the major new international art market , were conspicuously absent . Some sour notes John Marion , the indefatigable chief auctioneer and president of Sotheby Parke Bernet , termed the sale " every bit as successful as we had hoped " and underscored the importance of the European purchases , which in his opinion confirm international recognition of this period of American art . There were , nevertheless , a few sour notes . Several sculpture sales fell disappointingly below the estimates , and prices for only 14 of the 50 works topped the highest estimate . In some instances painting sales which broke records for individual artists failed to meet the even lowest estimate . ( SPB furnishes the pre-sale estimates " as educated guesses based upon comparable auction values , not as ' prices , ' " so the auction was not entirely the glowing success that the prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scull , who emerged from the event an estimated $2 million richer , deemed the results " splendid . " Staggering Picasso price Mr. Rauschenberg did not echo his sentiments and objected to the fact that the artists , whose works Mr , Scull originally bought at a fraction of their current cost , will not receive a share of the profit . In Paris , in contrast , artists are given a percentage of the resale prices . Mr. Rauschenberg also felt that the prices paid often did not reflect the true value of the works . Other malcontents , who staged pro1673ts outside the building , were a contingent of cab drivers and a group from " women in the arts , " who pointed out that only one work by one woman artist , Lee Boctecou , was included in the sale . The three major auctions held the preceding evening lacked controversy but not records , with a staggering record total for a painting sale of $7,809,900 . " The most important group of Picassos to come on the market since the artist 's ' death in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of 17 works spanning his major periods from 1906-1964 , demonstrated the kinds of prices the late artist now can command . The sale totaled $2,578,000 , exceeding the estimate of $2.3 million , and a new record for a Picasso was set at $720,000 ( previously $675,000 ) for " Jeune Homme au Bouquet " from his rose period , which was purchased by Galerie Beyeler of Switzerland . Swiss dealers were the most active in this sale , followed by four American buyers and the Japanese dealer , Fuji Art International , which purchased four . Record for a sculpture The Japanese , the Americans , and the Europeans ( especially the Swiss ) split fairly evenly in another significant sale , " important 19th and 20th century paintings and sculpture " ( property of various owners , including the Metropolitan Museum with a Courbet ) . Winners here were a Matisse sculpture , " Nu Couche I , " at $360,000 , breaking the previous sculpture record for the artist and for a 20th century sculpture by $100,000.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
