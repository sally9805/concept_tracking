Imagine the perfect fish . It would be plentiful , but would not harm other fish . Delicious to eat , it would also be such a powerful jumper and swimmer that sportsmen would revere its ability as a fighter . As an extra benefit , this paragon would feast on something that nobody wants . Does such a fish exist ? Indeed , yes . It is called the white amur ( Ctenopharyngodon idella ) , a member of the carp family that is native to eastern Asia , where it is prized as a delicacy . Three feet in length and 70 lbs . in weight , an adult amur just loves to eat-so much , in fact , that it is said to consume old shoes and decayed clothes . But mostly it gobbles aquatic weeds and , above all , algae . <P> These tiny plants , fertilized by nutrients in sewage and by the runoff of farm nitrates , explode into prodigious " blooms " that can cover entire lakes with a pea-green coat . When the algae die , they sink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastening its " death " - as has happened in Lake Erie . <P> Enter the white amur , which operates like a biological vacuum cleaner , eating up to four times its own weight in algae every day . In 1963 the U.S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries imported some amurs from Malaysia , later turned 70 of them over to the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission for study . Outlets were carefully blocked with wire mesh to prevent any from escaping . Still , accidents will happen , and last spring Arkansas biologists found a few white amurs in the White River , a tributary of the Mississippi . Since eight years of research had disclosed no faults in the amur , and the fish was now free in the environment anyway , the scientists released thousands of them into 15 Arkansas lakes , including one that comprises 6,700 algae-choked acres . <P> " We 'll know in two years exactly how this fish will work out here , " says the commission 's Jim Collins . " If they clean that 6,700-acre lake and do n't cause any problems for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best friends on our hands . " <P> Many imported fish-most notably the Asian walking catfish in Florida and the European carp in all states - have adapted so successfully to U.S. waters that they have crowded out valuable indigenous species . Other scientists fear that the amur could conceivably eat a lake 's entire supply of vegetation and thus trigger a serious new kind of ecological imbalance . But , says Collins , " if we thought the amur was a monster , we would n't stock it out . "
