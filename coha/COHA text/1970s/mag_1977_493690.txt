Stanley Kauffmann on films chorus . Noel Coward wrote about people who in life lived under the banner " Amuse or Die , " But often in Simon 's plays and films I find myself thinking , " Say , the folks who live in that apartment have pretty good script writers . " But if you accept the convention , it glistens . lf , rnutatis rnutandis . Tin ' Goodbye Girl had been made in the ' 30s , it would now be revived as what art houses like to call a Comedy Classic . A Clutch of Comedies The Goodbye Girl ( Warner Bros . ) . It 's Herbert ( Turning Point , Ross time again . And Richard ( Close Encounters ) Dreyfuss time again . And Neil ( $$$$$$ ) Simon time again . And Mrs. Simon , too ? Marsha Mason . Mason 's face , in fact , sets the tone of this comedy . In the heyday of magazines like Collier 's , the illustrations for the stories always had girls with snub noses . And they were snub-nosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same general type of face but more human ? Jane Wyman with gonads . She 's a very pleasant light comedian , and this script that her husband wrote for her fits her like a leotard . Dreyfuss does n't look at all like a Collier 's hero , or have a name like one , which is part of the ' 70s cool , but he has a mod version of the Collier 's hero to play : full of earnest busy innocence and competence , intense about Higher Things hut , when " reminded " of sex and love , intense about them too . Simon 's story is about as reliable as it could be , time-tested . The boy and girl meet cute , part cute , meet cute again . She 's an ex-chorus-liner , early 30s , with an 11-year-old daughter , and she has just been rattily abandoned by her lover . The rat owns the lease to their NY apartment and , unknown to Mason , has rented it to a young actor coming from Chicago ? Dreyfuss , who arrives in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She lets him stay if he keeps to his room , and whatever do you think happens eventually ? Some talents keep the fluff floating . First to the eye , Mason and 1 .. ) reyfuss . They have the energy and precision of circus sharpshooters , knocking off the points and the quick emotions like bottles thrown in the air , never missing , firing over their shoulders , wheeling and smacking . Nothing is real , nothing is phony . Then there 's Ross . Simon gave him a script full of bright dialogue , but that 's about all it 's full of . Ross had to chew thedialogue into film . had to devise action to keep it all from being like ping-pong at a fixed table . Push push push is Ross 's motto here , and he keeps the film moving either with the actors ' action or with editing , rarely strained but always in tension with what is essentially theater writing . ( Which is not to say that theater writing is static , only that its principles of action are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross 's chief job was to fix a kind of action -- ballet dancing ? that is too large for the film frame . Here his chief job is to fix a kind of action ? keen chit-chat ? that is too small for the film frame . Both intuitively and consciously , I think , he was aware of this ; and succeeded . On the other hand Simon writes more organically developed stories for films than he has so far done for the theater . ( By the time this review appears he 'll have a new play on Broadway , and maybe this opinion will need revision . ) Most of his plays have been sets of sketches , even when they were n't patently so as in Plaza Suite and California Suite . But film scripts like The Out-of - Towner ! : and The Goodbye Girl were at least designed to ride right through to the end . Perhaps the film medium 's ability to use a lot of places helps him , instead of the theater 's injunction to develop things in ( figuratively ) one place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a gag that could be given a nice long rest after Paper Moon and Alice Does n't Live Here Any More . And he invents an absolutely incredible character hang-up for his heroine ? something about the courage to say goodbye in order to say hello again , and if I 've got it wrong it does n't matter ? but it 's only an attempt to paste some disguise of depth on one more boy-meets-girl polka . And of course there 's the false realism . People simply do n't speak incessantly in smart dialogue . George S. Kaufman used a separate character in many of his plays to be a sidelines wisecracking Semi-Tough ( United Artists ) . When a picture has profanity within the first minute , it 's a fair tip-off that there 's rough sledding ahead . Desperation has set in early . This script by Walter Bernstein , from a novel by Dan Jenkins , is not a disaster , but it keeps promising to be one . It 's about two pro football players and the owner 's daughter who all love one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jock version of Design for Laying , it would n't be bad . But it gets lengthily and wearily involved with satire on religion-of-self fads ? the stuff that says I 'm OK and Now That I Think of It , I 'm Somewhat Better Than That . Those interludes are unbearable , and Bert Convy , who plays the gooey guru , is not entirely to blame . I also do n't understand why " our " team , which was behind in the first half of its big game , suddenly was able to win . Raunchiness of spirit more than language helps to keep the rest of it
