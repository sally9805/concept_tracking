IN 18th century America , the best architecture generally was done for church and government . In the 19th century , the U.S. 's energetic new merchants demanded and got structures that achieved power through honesty . For the first half of this century , the office builder tended to get the great result . Now the U.S. 's colleges and universities clearly have become architecture 's prime patrons . <P> The educators had almost no choice . Faced with the problem of educating the children produced in the post-World War II " baby boom , " nearly every college has sought-often desperately-to expand its facilities . Since 1960 the University of California has added three entirely new campuses and 77 major buildings on its six older campuses to cope with an increase in enrollment of 58,000 . The State University of New York , which in 1962 had small and relatively unknown campuses scattered around the state , has almost tripled in size to serve its present 195,000 students . <P> Such a tremendous amount of necessary new construction was obviously an opportunity for architects . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperatives of rental space that now make an egg-crate desolation of most city buildings . <P> For another , the colleges , as custodians of culture , accept what amounts to a moral obligation to recognize and foster quality in their buildings . Says Bernard P. Spring , dean of the architectural school at City College of New York : " We have so much good architecture at universities for the same reason that we have so much unrest there . The college is the most open institution around nowadays-open to ideas , to innovation , to change . " <P> After You , Please . The most advanced designs for theaters and research labs , not to mention libraries , have found their first expression in university buildings . Long spans , hyperbolic paraboloid roofs , computerized designs and other advanced structural techniques often are used with unabashed gusto . <P> Stylistically , the colleges seem to favor fortress-like buildings . Whether made of humble brick , crisp steel or powerfully molded concrete , the structures somehow look ready for any attack . A case in point is the rust-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State University of New York at Cornell . It not only looks eminently easy to defend but also is assertive in its own right . With good reason . The agricultural college , long treated as a stepchild by Cornell , needed to get back into view . While marking the ag college with the tower , however , Franzen respectfully designed and sited the $6,500,000 structure to defer to , rather than overwhelm its neighbors . " It is , " he says , " like someone who says , ' After you , ' in an elevator . "
