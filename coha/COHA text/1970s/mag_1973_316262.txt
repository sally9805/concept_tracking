The party machinery of the Irish Republic 's ruling Fianna Fil ( Soldiers of Destiny ) had rarely run more smoothly . In northeast Dublin , its workers delivered scores of voters to polling places in a shuttle of buses . In the Rialto district , they assembled strange processions of the elderly and infirm who looked as if they could scarcely make it to the nearest park bench , much less to the ballot box . There was even a Spanish nun , a fervent supporter of Prime Minister Jack Lynch , who appeared at one Dublin polling place to vote for the local Fianna Fil candidate . But she was challenged and told she could not vote . " All right , " she declared . " If I ca n't vote for him , I 'll pray for him . " <P> Alas , it was all in vain . The night after the election , it was clear that the Fianna Fil , which has ruled Ireland for 35 of the past 41 years , had been narrowly defeated by a new coalition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialist Labor Party . " There is no use playing politics , " an exhausted Jack Lynch told the country on television at 2 a.m . " I do n't think we are going to form a government . " <P> What went wrong ? Lynch , Prime Minister for the past six years , had been certain of victory last month when he suddenly called for a " clear and decisive mandate " to strengthen his hand in dealing with the spreading violence in Northern Ireland ( TIME , March 5 ) . The violence itself was hardly an issue at all . To some extent , the voters were obviously influenced by the opposition 's critical stand on a wide range of domestic problems : taxes , housing , pensions , living costs . <P> But in the end the coalition 's victory - by a thin but workable margin of about four seats in the 144-member Lower House or Dail-was probably the result less of specific issues than of a widespread feeling that after 16 straight years the Fianna Fil had been in office long enough . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the Fine Gael and a Minister in two previous governments . The mild-mannered son of the first head of government of the Irish Free State , Cosgrave , in the words of one independent politician , " has one of the cleanest pairs of hands in Irish politics . " <P> A country gentleman who raises horses for fox hunting on his 30-acre farm outside Dublin , Cosgrave has little of the easy pub manner that Irish voters customarily favor . " Bloody good ! " shouted one of his supporters as the returns came in last week . " Is n't that bloody good ? " " Yes , " replied Cosgrave crisply in his best Clifton Webb manner , a pink flush of pleasure on his face . " This is a good result . " <P> In his dealings with Britain and Northern Ireland , Cosgrave is expected to make no important changes in existing policy . He believes that the British government " should recognize that Northern Ireland is a part of Ireland and not part of Britain , " but he also believes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Labor Party , takes a softer line . Dublin , he says , should patiently assure Ulster 's Protestants that " we 're not going to try to take you over against your will . Let 's talk about unification only when you 're ready .
