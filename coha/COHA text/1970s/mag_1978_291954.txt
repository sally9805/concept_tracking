Typical of younger , newer members of Congress , Anthony J. ( " Toby " ) Moffett , 33 , is experienced , outspoken-and so independent that he did not even register as a Democrat until three weeks before he filed in 1974 to run for the House from northern Connecticut 's Sixth District . Before that , he earned a master 's degree in urban affairs at Boston College , worked with Boston street gangs for the U.S. Office of Education , was the first director of HEW 's Office of Students and Youth , was a Senate aide to Walter Mondale and headed Ralph Nader 's organization in Connecticut . Now a member of the House-Senate energy conference committee , he has led the fight to keep tight controls on natural gas prices and reform utility rates . Interviewed by TIME Senior Correspondent James Bell , Moffett echoed the mood of many in Congress . Excerpts : <P> <P> Many of us come from nonpolitical backgrounds , and we believe independence is politically popular with our voters . We are particularly independent of party . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are decrepit today . The party ca n't help you with money or even technical advice . So you build your own organization , and if it 's good , you get elected . We do n't owe leadership anything . And we 're not afraid of it . Many of us were not even our party 's choice in the primary campaigns . <P> The yardstick used in measuring a Congressman 's success has changed . It used to be the number of bills you introduced . Now our constituents think that perhaps too many bills are introduced . What counts with our constituents is the service we give them and how well we oversee laws already on the books . The public is certainly less deferential to any officeholder , including Congressmen . <P> Congress is also less deferential to the President than it used to be . Just before Christmas , I was summoned to the White House with other members of the energy conference committee . President Carter wanted to know if we 'd work until Christmas and all that . Well , we were called at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of us Congressmen made it by 5:40 ; I went on the subway . But the Senators did n't even start showing up until 6 . One did n't arrive until 6:20 , and another did n't come at all . I asked myself , " God ! Is this the way we respect the President ? " I always thought when you were called , you came . I guess this President has a problem with the Senators . He never belonged to their club . So maybe they are n't as respectful as they might be . <P> A lot of Democrats on the Hill had to do a lot of figuring about how to conduct themselves now that they had a member of their own party in the White House . <P> We 've learned that it 's really no big deal for a Democratic Congressman to oppose a Democratic President . <P> The new independence is too strong to disappear or even diminish significantly when some other President succeeds Carter . This means that it has become more difficult to govern , and it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
