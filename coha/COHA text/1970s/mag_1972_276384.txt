The Cocos Islands , a glistening coral archipelago , lie midway between Australia and Ceylon in the Indian Ocean . The main island , with a population of 500 , has been ruled more or less benevolently like a feudal fiefdom for the past 145 years by descendants of a Scottish sea captain named John Clunies-Ross . He settled in the coconut-growing islands in 1827 , imported Malay workers from Java to harvest the copra for export , and in 1886 his grandson obtained a grant in perpetuity to the islands from Queen Victoria . <P> Now the Cocos Islands have posed a troubling question for Australia : whether or not to impose the benefits - and the ills-of civilization on the islanders . Britain ceded sovereignty over the islands to Australia in 1955 , and Canberra simply assumed that the Malays were content with Clunies-Ross rule . No one knew for sure , of course ; the present ruler , John Clunies-Ross , a fifth-generation descendant of the islands ' original settler , forbade the Australian administrator to set foot on Home Island , which he considers his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago when a group of Malay headmen on Christmas Island , where the overpopulation from the Cocos was resettled after World War II , told Australian officials that their friends and relatives in the Cocos were like " birds in a cage . " The Cocos Islanders had written letters saying that they were not allowed to leave the islands even to visit relatives . <P> The Australian government sent an investigator to the Cocos , but his report was kept secret until last month , when it suddenly surfaced as a political issue . The report compares the Malay workers to slaves of a benevolent plantation owner in the pre-Civil War U.S. South . " Although they appear happy and contented , " the report says , " they seem to be very servile . " The Malay workers call Clunies-Ross " Tuan Besar , " meaning " Big Master . " For their labor , the Malays are paid six Cocos rupees a week ( about $2 ) in plastic tokens redeemable only at Clunies-Ross 's own store . Clunies-Ross , 43 , is depicted as something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Scottish dagger in his belt . <P> Reporters who flew to the Cocos Islands found the feudalism real enough . On Saturday mornings , for instance , Clunies-Ross meets with six Malay headmen to dispense whatever justice is called for ( the most common sentence is two weeks ' work without pay ) . " We have no need of courts as you know them , " he told newsmen . " Crime is hardly a problem . In fact , last year we had two thefts , which took up only 45 minutes of our time . " <P> In addition to his own system of unwritten laws , Clunies-Ross has devised a social welfare program that includes optional retirement with pension at 60 , free health care and housing . Most families have two boats , one for fishing and one for leisure . Education is voluntary , but " school days may end abruptly , " notes Clunies-Ross . " Anyone who does n't respond or is lazy gets sacked . " Children go to work at 14 , usually as apprentices in a trade .
