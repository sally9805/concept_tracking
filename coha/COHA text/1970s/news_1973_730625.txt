txt ENACTMENT of emergency state legislation to make $28 million of matching funds available to the Chicago Transit Authority , along with $32 million for other Illinois mass transit systems , was urged in a resolution adopted 38 to .0 by the City Council yesterday . The resolution submitted by Mayor Daley asked prompt approval by the General Assembly and Gov . Walker of the Mass Transportation Operating Assistance Act , which would provide the money . The act is pending in both the House and Senate . The legislation was prepared at Daley 's instructions and introduced Wednesday . Local communities would have to provide $1 , for each $2 of state money they receive . The plan , is for the city to provide $10 million and the county government $4 million from their shares of state motor fuel tax funds . This would make a total of $42 million available to the financiallydistressed CTA . SOME OTHER Chicago area transit systems , including suburban bus lines and commuter railroads , could qualify for portions of the other $32 million .

" - No action was taken on a proposal by minority aldermen that the city make $10 million of its motor fuel tax funds " available immediately to the - CTA without awaiting state action , and that suburban towns served by CTA be asked to .. make contributions . WRITTEN into the mayor 's proposed resolution was an amendment by Ald. Thomas E. Keane ( 31st ) , administration floor leader , asking the CTA to postpone both fare increases of 5 cents scheduled for Feb. 1 and cuts in service until the General Assembly has time to act . The special council meeting was called by Aldermen Seymour Simon 40th , Dick Simpson 44th , and John J. Hoellen 47th .

All the king 's horses and all the king 's men could n't put Humpty together again . " Keane said the proposed legislation would , provide a temporary solutiori to problems of the CTA and other transit systems , which he said in many instances are in more trouble than the CTA . BUT HE SAID there must be long term financing as a joint effort of federal , state , city and county governments , and that eventually the problems must be solved in the Chicago area by creating a metropolitan transit system . Ald. Claude W. B. Holman 4th , council president pro tern , said that " if mass transportation fails , the development of Chicagoland will go down the drain . " Ald. Jack I. Sperling 50th said immediate appropriation by the city of $10 million " would only delay the agony 30 days .
