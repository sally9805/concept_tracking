txt The world 's giant oil companies and the major exporting nations  --  including Iran , where the pipe : . line above carries crude to waiting tankers  --  last week reached a stalemate on increases in royalties paid the producing countries . Some saw the dispute as one " between the haves and the have-nots. " and Indonesla . Following expiry. : tion of the deadline , the O.P.E.C ... states then met and pledged to increase their tax and royalty income by legislative or other legal means unless the companies accepted the countries ' terms by a new deadline of Feb. 15 . Negotiating details have not been precisely disclosed . But weekend reports from New York said the Persian Gulf states were demanding an increase totaling $12.3 - billion in government revenues over the next five years , compared with a company offer of increases totaling 86.9-billion over the same period . In 1969 , the 10 O.P.E.C . countries received $6.2-billion for their oil . The impact of such increases would be higher prices for oil products , such as gasoline , fuel oil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread geographically since the O.P.E.C . countries control more than 85 per cent of world oil exports . Even the United States would be affected though it draws only 3 per cent of its oil requirements from the Middle East , the area covered by present price . negotiations . The reason is that the American Middle Eastern imports are largely fuel oils that are not easily replaceable in present tight market conditions . A Shift From a Buyer 's to A Seller 's Market LONDON  --  The international oil business , which is notoriously crisis-prone , has long been a three-cornered struggle for advantage among the producing countries , the consuming countries and the international oil companies . The producing countries , mostly the Arab states , Iran and Venezuela , had the oil to sell . The consuming countries , that is the Western industrial states and Japan , had the big markets . And the oil companies . largely American and British names like Esso and B.P .. more or less controlled both the oil and the markets . But as events over the past few weeks have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the producer states , united at least nominally in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( O.P.E.C. ) . Since the middle of January , negotiations have been played out in Teheran between a three ? nation group ? Iran , Iraq and Saudi Arabia ? representing six Persian Gulf producer countries , and a delegation representing 22 international oil companies . Last week , the two sides failed to agree on terms of a price increase before the deadline of last Wednesday , arbitrarily set by the O.P.E.C . countries , which in addition to the three negotiators are Kuwait , Qatar , Abu Dhabi , Libya , Algeria , Venezuela United Front To counter this united front , the American oil companies got Washington to agree to an andtrust waiver so that a worldwide negotiating cartel could 5e formed to mitigate the price increases to the consuming countries . However , the negotiating team . led by Lord Strathalmond. of British Petroleum and George Piercy of the Standard Oil Company ( New Jersey ) , returned to London over the weekend , looking rather dispirited . Behind their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international oil business has been transformed from a buyer 's to a seller 's market over the past year . The continued closure of the Suez Canal , a shortage of oil tankers , the disruption of a major Middle Eastern pipeline and deliberate production cutbacks by a militant Libyan government have put a squeeze on supplies at a time of an unex , - pectedly sharp increase in oil demand . The other development is -a new-found aggressiveness on the part of the producing countries to press their advantage . Some observers have seen the Teheran talks in a wider context than just the international oil business .
