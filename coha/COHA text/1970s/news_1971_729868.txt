txt The burden of delivering the growing volume of mail swiftly and cheaply is proving as heavy for the United States Postal Service as it did for the Post Office Department that it replaced six months ago . Despite innovations in service , aggressive leadership and an increase of about half a billion dollars in postal revenues , it takes longer today to deliver an average letter than it did three years ago . According to the latest figures , it took an average of 1:5 days to handle first-class mail in the first part of 1969 . The ' comparable figure for the second quarter of 1971 is 1.72 clays , an increase of roughly 15 per cent . And letters bound for New York , where service is probably the worst , : take an average of ail least 2.2 days to be delivered ? about half a day longer than the combined average of nine other major cities measured by the Postal Service . Supporters of the new organization , begun under former Postmaster General Winton M. Blount and now carried on by his successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for the Postal Service to show improvement  --  about two or three years , They say that , although labor Elmer T. Klassen settlements have added to costs , the Postal Service has managed to eliminate patronage politics , revitalize management and inject a growing measure of modernization into its operations . For the most part , the critics remain unimpressed . Few offer any alternatives , though , arid at least a dozen Congressmen have asked for an outright repeal of the law that created the Postal Service as a substitute for the 196-year-old Post Office Department . The criticism , together with the rate increases , charges of deteriorating service , political gaffes and unsettled labor-problems , has raised concern over the prospects of the new agency . In large part , the Congress was persuaded to adopt the reorganization because , despite growing , financial deficits , the service had failed to keep pace with the needs of American mail users , There were Insufficient funds to seek modernization , the Postal Service could not control its own costs ? it could not set wages , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes that required postal adjustments . So far , the reorganization has not yet enabled the managers of the Postal Service to have a strong impact on the quality of the service . " We have been able to produce some instant results , " said Merrill A , Hayden , the Deputy Postmaster General , " but one of . my main concerns is that major improvements are still a couple of years away , " Perhaps the major symptom of postal problems has been the growing feeling that for years the quality of postal service has been deteriorating , that mail just does n't get there as fast as it used to or with as much , reliability . The National Service . Index , ' a quarterly . report published by the Postal Service as a measure of the flow of mail , shows that the average 1.72 days it took to handle first class mail in the second quarter of 1971 was actually an improvement over the comparable figure of 1.97 registered in the last three months of 1970 , during the Christmas mail rush . Final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail handling , but postal officials are hopeful that substantial progress will be shown in reducing overtime and speeding delivery of an increased volume of mail , Some postal officials also stress that letters are sent across longer distances today , contributing to delays in handling . But others say the distance factor is marginal . And , according to the service index , longer delays are affecting postcards , airmail and firstclass parcels as well as firstclass letters . A key factor mentioned repeatedly by postal leaders is that facilities are old and automation is at a minmum . Former Postmaster General Blount once told an interviewer that the Post Office had about $1,500 per employe invested in capital facilities , as compared to $32 , - 000 , for the communications industry . As a partial remedy , the Postal Service has the authority to issue up to $10-billion in bonds over a period of years . Most of this will go for new facilities and machinery , and a " crash " building program has been undertaken , Mr. Hayden said the service hoped to construct a network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speed delivery of mail such as parcels while reducing mail processing costs . Few quarrel with the assertion that newer buildings and equipment will help greatly to improve service . But installing a greater degree of automation , and improving productivity of postal workers , may prove , harder to achieve . According to figures intro- , duced at postal rate hearings this year , the productivity of postal workers ? that is , the output per worker ? is not keeping up with that of workers in the private , nonfarm sector . ) The figures show that the output of workers in the private , nonfarm sector rose 34 per cent over a 10-year period ending in 1969 , whereas the productivity of postal workers in : the same period rose only one-half ? of one percentage point . Mr. Hayden and other postal officials hope to increase automation by substituting machines for departing workers . Indeed , the current ? union contract has a no-layoff provision . But whether they can achieve higher work standards . is another matter . A dispute has arisen over the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers ? an issue the unions are fighting , " The freedom to establish work standards is absolutely a key matter to the future of the Postal Service , " Mr. Hayden , declared . Complicating the picture is the changing role of the postal worker , Mr. Hayden believes that Post Office employes perform " as if they were paid industry rates , which they are n't . " Others are less complimentary , such as the newspaper lobbyist who complained that " the dedication that once characterized the Post Office worker is gone . " Francis S. Filbey , the president of the American Postal Workers Union , defended the job his ' union members are doing , " I think , however , that the Postal Service today does not have the respect that it had back in those days , " Mr. Filbey said , recalling his early years with the department . During the Depression he lived in Baltimore and remembers being the only man with a job on the block . " As a postal clerk , you were a respected member of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government is considered by many people to be a sin , " he said . He observed that in small communities the postal worker still had what was considered " a pretty good job , " but in larger cities the job was thought to be less desirable , The difference may be reflected in the quality of service . The delays in New York City are an example , Mr. Hayden said that the mail service there , particularly Manhattan , was " just unbelievable , " " People just do n't understand how it can take a letter two or three days to get across town , ' he said . " They have to realize that it 's in transport , , on the streets , a good part of the time , because transportation is so slow in New York . " He also observed that mail processing in New York was not " very up to date . " What has worried some mail users the most is the issue of increasing rates . Magazine publishers , to take only one example , will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in five years . Most observers agree that opinion journals like The New Republic and the National Review will be hit the hardest by the jumping postage costs . Representative Morris Udall of Arizona , the chairman of the Postal Service Subcommittee , said he believed such magazines should be helped . Whether Congress would be willing to create a special subsidy is uncertain , however . " Once ' you open ' the door , where do you stop ? " Mr. Udall , a Democrat , asked . " Nevertheless , there 's going to be great pressure for Congress to step in somewhere down the road . " Postal officials would ' find such. , a move unpleasant , because it would undermine the agency 's independence and could lead down the road to failure , Together with the increased postage rates and longer delivery periods , there have been some substantial cutbacks in service . ? ' These include a reduction in the , use of airlifts for first-class mail , a reduction in the number of business delivery trips in downtown areas , and a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report of the . Postmaster General , and introduced at postal rate commission hearings , show that the number of hours consumed on a daily basis in the collection of mail declined 22 per cent between fiscal year 1968 and fiscal year 1970 . According to the National Service Index , 58 per cent of all first class mail in the second quarter of this year was delivered within , one day , and 81 per cent within two days . This ' compares unfavorably with the first three months of 1969 , when the new management of theservice took ' over . At that time , 64 per cent of all first class mail was delivered within one day , and 88 per cent within two days . A witness at the hearings , Elmer Cerin , a Washington lawyer who worked in the Post Office Department for 14 years , appeared ? at the hearing to represent " the public interest " and the first-class mail user . He said evening collection had been eliminated in most cities , business and residential areas , except for the main post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most places . One of the results is that more and more heavy mail users are turning to private delivery services and alternative means of getting the mail through . Some utilities deliver their own bills , for example , and more and more consumers are patronizing companies like the United Parcel Service for delivery , In Congress , the issues that have attracted the most criticism revolve around the selection of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation to perform a major study , and of President ' Nixon 's old law firm to act as counsel for . a bond issue . Both selections involved millions of . dollars for the recipients , and extensive hearings were conducted over alleged irregularities in selections . Nevertheless , the Postal Service boasts that it has eliminated patronage politics from the Post Office , and most observers in Congress and elsewhere seem to agree . " My own feeling is that they have really done a good job in this particular area , " said Mr. Udall , Other achievements of the Postal Service include the development of new programs like express mail service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to give superfast delivery at a relatively high postage rate . The best-publicized programs guarantee delivery of first class , and airmail within certain specified periods , but critics have charged that comparable delivery-service was available not too many , years ago at lower rates . Mr. Blount announced last October that a program to deliver local ' mail overnight was 93 per cent effective , In the past , postal officials say , such statistical evidence of success was not available . Another successful reform that postal officials are proud of is the elimination of some 3,000 or so jobs at the regional and headquarters level , This has streamlined the service 's management and " cut out the ' fat , " in the words of a spokesman for the agency , , Reflecting on the nearly six months of the new operation , Representative Udall said : " The way to judge the new Postal , Service'is not by some abstract , ) ideal standards , but by where we would be without it ? Congress would be faced with either voting a large postal rate increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , even Mr , the former postal official who appeared as a critic at postal rate hearings , believes that the agency can succeed , " What I am fighting for is better productivity , better service ? and there 's no doubt in my mind that we are going to get it , " he declared .
