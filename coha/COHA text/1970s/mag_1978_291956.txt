Though one of the most talkative politicians of modern times , Humphrey will be remembered for his deeds , not his words . They were rarely memorable , but they were invariably heartfelt . They expressed rather than camouflaged the real man . A Humphrey sampler : <P> On speaking his mind . " I 've seen all these people that hem and haw . They never quite get around to saying where they are or who they are or what they are , what they want , where they 've been or where they 're going . You have to make some judgments ; you just ca n't keep waiting for more evidence . " <P> On the politics of joy . " Happiness is contagious , just exactly like being miserable . People have to believe that they can do better . They 've got to know that there 's somebody that wants to help and work with them , somebody that has n't tossed in the towel . " <P> On helping others . " Compassion is not weakness , and concern for the unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know a lot of people tell me I 'm not tough enough . Listen , there are enough tough people in the world . " <P> On showing emotions . " A fellow that does n't have any tears does n't have any heart . " <P> On being snubbed by President Lyndon Johnson , who thought he had leaked a story to the press . " I 'm the living example that a man can be in the deep freeze for at least two weeks and still live . But then he 'd give you that quick thaw . A wink with one of those eyes was just like two cymbals coming together in a clash . He 'd forgiven me in one flick of the eyelid . " <P> On foreign policy . " We ca n't be the world 's policeman , but we can be the world 's idealist . " <P> On adversity . " Some people look upon any setback as the end . They 're always looking for the benediction rather than the invocation . Most of us have enough problems so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 've had it . ' But you ca n't quit . That is n't the way our country was built . " <P> On love . " The greatest gift that has come to me is the affection of so many - far more important than people feeling sorry for me . In fact , feeling sorry for someone is simply to give him a little pain reliever . Love is a healing force . "
