Stand not upon the order of your going , but go at once . <P> - Macbeth <P> MANY Americans anxious to see the U.S. disengage from Indochina have urged on President Nixon what might be called the Shakespearean solution to the war . To them , the invasion of Cambodia last spring and the current incursion into Laos seem only to be widening the theater of fighting-an odd order of going indeed . Last week , at an informal press conference , the President reiterated that he intends to go on reducing the U.S. role in the war through progressive troop withdrawals . But Nixon left a wide margin for maneuvering to carry out that intention . <P> No Limitation . The President ruled out the use of U.S. ground troops in Laos , Cambodia or North Viet Nam . But , reaffirming a policy first spelled out last December , he said : " I am not going to place any limitation upon the use of airpower ... It will be directed against those military activities which I determine are directed against and thereby threaten our remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined to shut the door on the possibility of a South Vietnamese invasion of the North-an idea that South Viet Nam 's Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky has repeatedly mentioned . The President is aware that any full-fledged attack against North Viet Nam could draw China into the conflict , and he has taken extraordinary pains to reassure Peking that U.S. policy does not threaten its interests . But he also knows that three divisions of North Vietnamese regulars are massed just across the DMZ . To discourage Hanoi from sending them to attack the ARVN troops in Laos , Nixon deliberately left open the possibility of a South Vietnamese counterattack across the DMZ . <P> The sole limitation on airpower , Nixon said , will be to disregard " a rather ridiculous suggestion that is made from time to time-I think the latest by Hans Morgenthau-that our airpower might include the use of tactical nuclear weapons . " The President was referring to an article written for the New Republic by Morgenthau , the University of Chicago political scientist and inveterate war critic . Morgenthau argued that while the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the color of the casualties , " its goal is still a military victory . And the only way to win a war of national liberation , he added , is to deliver a crushing blow to the enemy-the kind of blow that tactical nuclear weapons " could accomplish overnight . " <P> Actually , North Vietnamese regulars and Viet Cong guerrillas are so widely dispersed that no crushing blow is possible . The U.S. could destroy Hanoi and other population centers with tactical nukes-that is , if it wanted to ensure Peking 's entry into the conflict , or even risk World War III . <P> Danger Point . The President 's professed rationale is to protect retreating U.S. troops by keeping the enemy at bay . As the White House sees it , the Communists hope to wage an all-out attack early next year , in an attempt to influence the 1972 election . Nixon argues that the best course is to move now to destroy the supplies that the Communists are planning to use later . Said he : " What this relates to ... is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a year when the Vietnamization program 's very success creates the greatest point of danger . "
