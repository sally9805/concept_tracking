The Iranian crisis has produced the world 's largest and most complex psychodrama . Every day in Washington President Carter is brought up to the minute on the Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini 's psychological profile , a shifting and convoluted picture that is alien to White House experience . And the Ayatullah himself has already told the world that his actions are attuned to his perception of Carter 's " guts . " <P> A small elite group of men and women are wheedling , cajoling , flattering and threatening in an effort to reach one another 's minds . Rarely has the international struggle for influence grown so intricate , with religious , legal , family , political , economic , humanistic and military considerations so delicately mixed . We seek to dissuade some leaders from doing certain things , to persuade others to act , a ritual as old as civilization but raised now to the speed of electronic signals and extended to every argument that can be reached by TV cameras . <P> Perceptions often mean more , in the short run , than the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can figure more than aircraft carriers . Terrorist tactics can mock stockpiled nukes . From Harvard to Georgetown to the White House situation room , the scholars and strategists see emerging from the peculiarities of the Iranian situation a new and as yet unclear dimension to the world struggle . It derives partly from the fact that the U.S. has a military equal in the world . Washington can no longer fall back on an overwhelming power margin as the ultimate persuader . <P> Former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger hears an echo from the 18th century , when armies used to maneuver around each other . The one emerging in an inferior position often surrendered quickly so that it could live to fight again . " We march television cameras instead of troops , " he says . Warfare that used to seek land , wealth or subjugation now is aimed at the mood in Washington or Qum or Moscow or Riyadh . <P> Hunter College Professor John G. Stoessinger in his book Crusaders &; Pragmatists focused attention earlier this year on " the human element in American foreign policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President holds our future in his hands . His personality may be our destiny . " <P> Stoessinger could have added the names of Khomeini , Gaddafi , Khalid , Schmidt , Giscard , Ohira , Brezhnev , Lopez Portillo , Torrijos , Thatcher-all humans magnified mightily by the television lens , transposed into looming actors on a global stage . <P> Behind any persuasion , of course , must be the belief that a nation will take draconian steps . But the capability must be there for credibility . The White House is nearly convinced that we must apply some kind of " bloodless military pressure " to lodge that message in the minds of allies and enemies . But a central question remains : Would Carter ever send U.S. forces into real combat for the national interest ?
