Max Rafferty is to California education what Spiro Agnew is to national politics-a spellbinder of alliterative conservatism . Eight years ago , Rafferty swept the nonpartisan race for state Superintendent of Public Instruction by denouncing " permissive , pragmatic progressivism . " He lost a loud bid for the Senate two years ago , but has since delighted his admirers by advocating mass searches for drugs in student lockers , by presenting guidelines for " moral instruction " that criticized pacifism , and by urging science teachers to give " equal time " to the Adam and Eve account of creation . <P> Now Rafferty is running for a third term . He is slaying all visible dragons , from teacher strikes to compulsory busing for integration ( " impossible to implement " ) . Given the conservative tide in California , he should be a shoo-in . He is not . <P> Cool Professional . His opponent is relatively unknown , soft spoken and black . Wilson Riles , 53 , is also a cool professional who is willing to explain unglamorous specifics of education . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California Poll while Rafferty has lost four , bringing Riles to within striking distance of a win . His supporters include not only liberals but also conservatives like S.I . Hayakawa , president of San Francisco State College . <P> Riles has been a state education official for twelve years , four of them as Rafferty 's assistant superintendent . Federal officials regard his program of dispensing funds to disadvantaged youngsters as one of the best in the country . Presidents Johnson and Nixon appointed him chairman of two task forces on urban education . <P> Below Norms . While Rafferty has stressed emotional issues like drugs and busing , Riles concentrates on education . He notes that a recent evaluation showed that statewide gains in reading have still left 65% of the first , second-and third-graders below national norms . His proposed remedy : make a preschool program available to every California child . He also feels that teaching reading mainly through old-fashioned phonics , which Rafferty favors , is oversimple , and that many students can benefit from other methods . <P> The campaign has been muddied by innuendo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under court orders to integrate their schools . Right-wing literature , which Rafferty repudiates , has sought to link Riles with Communists , chiefly because of his work with the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation during the 1950s . <P> Riles ' headway may reflect a growing sophistication about educational controversies . Says Riles : " People are tired of being polarized on emotional issues and tired of waiting for someone to help them provide good education for their children . " The odds still favor Rafferty , but few expected that Riles would come as close as he has .
