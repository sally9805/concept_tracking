Pride in Carew <P> To the Editors : <P> Proud ! That 's how I feel being a Minnesotan . Rod Carew July 18 is one of the reasons . <P> Louise Ingebritson St. Paul <P> Your article on Rod Carew kept asserting that he had never received the recognition he deserved . For eleven years we fans have been putting him in the All-Stars games ' starting lineups . Millions recognize him as the finest hitter since Clemente ; it 's the baseball writers who have neglected him . <P> Jon Solomon Chapel Hill , N. C. <P> Rod Carew is n't a star ; he 's a living legend . <P> <P> Andy Sims Waukesha , Wis . <P> Rod Carew is one of the greatest baseball players ever , and it is perfectly all right to give him the glory he deserves ; the problem arises when unfair comparisons start . <P> It is unfair to compare Carew , whose forte is hitting for average , to players who excel and surpass Carew in other aspects of the game , like Reggie Jackson and Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll trade 15 Reggie Jackson baseball cards for one Rod Carew . I 'll even throw in the bubble gum and the candy bars . <P> Hal Miller Abilene , Texas <P> The correct translation of chai on Rod Carew 's chain is " life " and not , as you stated , " health . " The word is made up of the Hebrew letters chet and yud , which together form the word chai- life . But then again , if one has health , one has life . <P> <P> Cantor Chaskele Ritter Brooklyn <P> California Dream <P> It worked ! We 've fooled the rest of the country . During the ' 60s , when untold millions migrated to California in search of the Golden State dream July 18 , we longtime California residents began to realize that our beautiful state was being devastated by out-of-state foreigners . So we started an unspoken and subliminal campaign to discourage people from relocating here . Thank you , Mr. DeVoss , for informing the rest of the world that California truly is a miserable place to live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. DeVoss , like so many foreigners , was expecting some idealistic Utopian state . If " the essence of California does not travel well , " why am I looking out my window at a line of out-of-state camper ? <P> <P> Michael Woolf Fresno , Calif . <P> <P> California has been systematically devoured since 1945 . Having fouled our air and water , despoiled our hills and farmlands and perverted our liberal culture , the locust pilgrims now cry fraud . <P> Mr. DeVoss notwithstanding , everyone in California agrees on nothing-except , perhaps , that homebred flakes are preferable to the imported variety . <P> <P> Barry Willy Vacaville , Calif . <P> <P> Rating Airports <P> Your writers forgot to rate the friendliness of the people who work at the airports in the guide July 18 . Cheerful employees can always brighten a weary or troubled traveler . I 've been in only six of the airports mentioned , but I would rate them as follows : Denver 's Stapleton : very helpful and friendly . Kennedy and LaGuardia : surprisingly friendly and helpful .
