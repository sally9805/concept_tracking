Frazzled Flyers <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> You struck a recently frazzled but lighly entertained nerve in this traveler with " Flying the Crowded Skies " Aug. 14 . As a project evaluator for the Federal Government , I spent five weeks during June and July plying the heavens on various airlines . After logging about 9,200 as-the-crow-flies miles , eating God knows what with someone 's elbow stuck in my ear and being kicked by an unruly child on the other side , one might think I would never want to fly again . But give me a few weeks to adjust my wobbly knees and popping ears to terrestrial life , and I 'll be winging my way to visit a friend in Boston . I need my head examined . <P> <P> Karen Santic Washington , D.C. <P> <P> I wish the airlines would abolish all bargain fares . They could then lower the exorbitant regular fares to more reasonable levels , thus sparing themselves the ill will of disgruntled would-be passengers . Margaret Piton Montreal <P> In the past year many charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , deeply discounted fares . The charter flights ( and later the Laker flights ) are what forced the reductions . The CAB has refused to protect the public by insisting that all Super Saver-type fares must exist for a specified lifetime ( such as a five-year minimum ) . Once the charters are gone , you will see the discounts disappear quickly , and the airlines will have the public right where they want it paying high fares without the option of the less expensive charter flights . <P> <P> Robert J. Stein Jr Albany <P> Your story on air travel says nothing about the heavy subsidies the air traveler enjoys . The subsidy is in the form of virtually free airports , traffic controllers , weather services , FAA inspectors and , in the case of smaller airlines , direct cash subsidies . In 1976 , for example , North Central Airlines received a direct payment of $13 million . The 1977-78 <P> Department of Transportation budget shows $77 million for such subsidies , to say nothing of the $2.4 billion for airports and airways . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pillow Plumpers <P> I reject Lance Morrow 's premise and conclusions Aug. 7 : those who voted for Proposition 13 have a duty in the Judaeo-Christian tradition to volunteer services to others or otherwise be seen as " narcissistic " pillow plumpers . <P> I see nothing that gives Morrow or any other person claim to another person 's hard-earned money or time . And I have never seen anything more narcissistic than a mouth-flapping , duty-oriented politician or a flowing-robed , self-sacrificing religious potentate . Our first moral duty can only be self-survival ; that duty should be required of no one else . <P> <P> Newton Baird Georgetown , Calif . <P> <P> Volunteering is not self-sacrifice , it is doing work for the love of it , or because you badly want to see the job done . For those two motives I will do any job unpaid , if the paycheck for another job is already in my pocket . <P> <P> Patricia Mathews Albuquerque
