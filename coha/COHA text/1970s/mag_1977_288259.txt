Major savings for minor operations <P> They are usually open only nine hours a day , provide patients with nothing more to eat than a little orange juice and crackers , and shuttle them in and out of the operating room so fast they hardly realize that they have been under the knife . Surgical factories ? Not quite . In the past few years , more than 70 such private , one-day surgical centers have opened in the U.S. Undertaking minor surgery of all kinds-from face lifts to vasectomies to repair of hernias-the clinics discharge patients almost as soon as they shake off their postoperative grogginess . The only radical surgery performed is on medical bills . By never keeping anyone overnight , they are able to undercut typical hospital costs for operations by as much as 50% . <P> The first such independent outpatient surgical clinic was opened seven years ago in Phoenix by two anesthesiologists , Drs . Wallace A. Reed and John L. Ford . Since then , some 46,000 patients have passed through the six operating rooms of their Surgicenter . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has spawned three satellite Surgicenters - in Sacramento and Palo Alto , Calif. , and in Louisville-and inspired dozens of unaffiliated imitators in other cities . Says Ford : " Up to 40% of all surgery can be done on a come-and-go basis . Our objective is to keep people from being hospitalized who do n't really need to be . " <P> Typical of the Surgicenter 's cases is that of Andrew Dunham , a blond , 23-year-old Phoenix truck driver whose severely injured finger became badly infected and required surgery . Had his doctor chosen to operate in a hospital , Dunham would probably have been kept at least one night , perhaps longer . Instead , the surgeon-one of more than 300 doctors in the Phoenix area who occasionally use the Surgicenter-directed him to the facility at 10:45 one morning last week . Half an hour later , he was wheeled into an operating room and given a general anesthetic . In just 20 minutes , the surgeon had made an incision , cleaned out the infection and sutured and splinted the finger . After about an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken home . Total elapsed time : 2 hours . His bill for using the facility : $170 . <P> Most people are delighted not only by the low costs and quick exits but by the cheerful , comfortable informality of the small clinics , including friendly follow-up phone calls that nurses make to the patients ' homes . If unexpected trouble does occur , the patient can be quickly taken to a nearby hospital . But because patients are carefully screened and examined beforehand by the surgeon , there are rarely any complications , and according to the clinics , there has not been a single fatality in more than 80,000 operations .
