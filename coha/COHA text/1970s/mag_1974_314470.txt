A woman In the Sky by James Hanley 223 pages , Horizon Press $6.95 <P> As if it were a darkened empty stage , A Woman in the Sky begins with voices discussing an unfortunate old lady who jumped out the window of her lonely cell in Totall Point , a drab , new high-rise apartment in London . Gradually the voices become characters . Scenery is sketched in , and the reader eventually learns that the old lady was a Mrs. Kavanagh , a 76-year-old alcoholic with a string of arrests for public drunkenness . The Housing Council relocted Mrs. Kavanagh in totall Point after her small house was flattened by progress . Like so many of the aged and helpless , she had in effect been buried in the sky . <P> Yet what begins in seedy depression evolves into the story of an extraordinary friendship . In addition to the comfort of the bottle , Mrs. Kavanagh had Mrs. Biddulph , a regular drinking buddy whenever she was not serving short sentences for shoplifiting . The two women were different but complementary . Mrs Kavanagh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hands of the police came about because she made a public nuisance of herself by muzzily trying to shake strangers hands . Mrs Biddulph survives on a generalized anger about the state 's institutuion compassion and the pathetic efforts of the well-meaning . <P> There is no shortage of well-meaning people in British Novelist James Hanley 's latest book : bobbies judges , probation officers and clergymen , even a kind neighbor who wants to befriend Mrs. Biddulph , after being shaken by the sight of her friend lying broken on the pavement . Mrs. B. rejects them all , apparently because they can not substitute anything as authentic as her own bitter loneliness . <P> Yet Mrs. B. is profoundly vulnerable to Mrs. K. 's deluded belief that she has a son somewhere at sea . At Mrs. K. 's request , her friend even writes letters to the nonexistent son ; they are signed " your fond mother , " but never posted . <P> Instead she keeps them in a box . After Mrs. Kavanagh 's death , the letters take on a deepened significance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the window where I am , and I wished you 'd come round the corner , quick , a surprise , I 'd have gone on my tiptoes to shout your name out of the window . Love , that I would , since people round here think I have n't a son at all , that 's what they 're like these days , ca n't even dream about nice things happening these times . " <P> Liverpool Conrad . The narrow line between private reveries at the window and actually stepping over the sill threads subtly throughout the book . As in a great deal of good fiction , the novel grows out of character , not plot or theme . Those who have read any of Hanley 's more than 40 other novels should not be surprised . At 73 , he is one of the most consistently praised and least-known novelists in the English-speaking world . Born in Dublin and raised in Liverpool , Hanley became a merchant seaman at age 13 , just before World War I. He is self-educated . Over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashions . Some early sea stories have been compared to Conrad , though they are far less romantic . Hanley has been called a proletarian writer , too , mainly on the raw strengths of a fictional tetralogy about the hard lives of Irish workers in Liverpool , which began in the 1930s with The Furys.
