txt Apollo 14 astronauts Alan B. Shepard Jr . and Edgar Mitchell moved into their lunar landing craft late tonight i n preparation for man 's third landing on the moon early tomorrow . Their first task upon going into the lunar lander was to make a final check on a possibly faulty battery in the ascent stage of the spacecraft . The check disclosed no problem . The battery registered voltage within acceptable limits . If the battery had not been putting out a certain number of volts , the landing would have been canceled . However the battery was checked last night and found to be operating properly and there was no indication of any serious malfunction . Lander Is Readied Following the check , Shepard and Mitchell continued with the job of preparing the lunar lander for undocking and separation from the mother ship and the landing on the moon . The separation of the landing craft was accomplished successfully at 10:51 p. m. and the module began flying alone in lunar orbit before heading They are scheduled to touch down on the lunar surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains in orbit around it in the mother ship . Once Shepard and Mitchell moved into the lunar lander , their call sign became Antares , the name of a bright star the astronauts have been using to navigate on the way to the moon . And the call sign for the mothership became Kitty Hawk in memory of the strip of sand in North Carolina where the Wright brothers made man 's first flight . The astronauts have been in a 10 by 69 mile egg-shaped orbit ? with the sharp end of the egg at the 10 mile distance  --  since this morning . Orbit Is Changed This is a change from previous moon landing missions in which the lunar lander stayed in a 70 mile circular orbit with the command module before separating . Then it would go into its own orbit with low point of 10 miles before breaking out of the orbit for the landing . What this change does , in effect , is save fuel in the lunar lander by using fuel in the mothership to take it down to the 10 mile point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shepard and Mitchell if they have to seek as alternate landing point on the MOOD . When they hit the 10 - mile point for the first time , Roosa told the mission control center here : " This is so deceiving . We could be 500 feet in the air the way the terrain looks . " And Mitchell said : " Looks like we 're getting mighty- low here . It 's a fairly different sight from the higher situation . " When the ground told him that there should be 40,000 feet between the spacecraft and the highest features on the moon , he replied : " Well , I 'm glad to hear you say we 're that high . It looks like we 're quite a bit lower . " As a matter of fact , we 're below some of the peaks on the horizon , but that 's only an illusion . " Moon Surface Described Mitchell then noted that " the surface appears to be a lot smoother down here . . . and , particularly at this higher sun angle , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an unusual sensation flying this low . " Getting a good look at the moon apparently was what it took to get the astronauts , who heretofore have been the silent tvne. to start speaking . When they went into their original orbit around the moon earlier this morning , Shepard , who 'd been even more closemouthed than the rest , said : " Wow , this is really a wild place up here . It has all the grays , browns , whites , dark craters that everybody 's talked about before . " It 's really quite a sight . No atmosphere at all . Everything is clear up here . Really fantastic . " Whets His Interest Mitchell said , " As interesting as this is from orbit , all it does is whet your appetite to Cone Crater. ! ' Cone Crater is the crater atop a 330-foot hill that Shepard and Mitchell will climb in search of five-billion-year-old rocks after landing on the moon .                    @
