txt Letters to the Editor pg . 42 Letters to the Editor Panic in the Subway To the Editor : As a passenger on Tuesday . night 's stalled EE train , I must register my disgust at the Transit Authority 's statement holding the riders at fault for creating a near disaster . True , many passengers panicked , broke windows and jumped to the tracks . But this was after an hour of standing in a dark , airless train without any knowledge of what was happening . The latter was probably the most crucial factor leading to these actions . Even the calmest passengers could not help feeling a sense of desperation seeing some of their fellow riders gasping for air and collapsing . It was more than two hours before those of us in the rear of the train heard that we would be led out soon . During all this time the'train was only a few hundred feet from the Queens Plaza station . Surely the passengers could have been evacuated in an orderly manner much sooner . Although it would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two hours would have put most riders a little more at ease . The responsibility for this incident rests solely on the T.A . Its callous disregard for the welfare of the riding public is no longer inexcusable ; it is criminal . Subway riders have long ago given up any hopes of traveling in comfort . Are we no longer entitled to travel in relative safety ? ANDREW KOMENDANTOV New York , Nov. 11 , 1970 An editorial on this subject appears today . One Taiwan  --  One China To the Editor : While I endorse the fundamental argument in your Oct. 31 editorial , " For a Two-China Initiative , " I think it needs further comments . It is unfortunate that the " TwoChina " instead of " One Taiwan , One China " was used in the editorial title , although " Taiwan , " as contrasted to " China , " was used throughout the editorial . Chiang Kai-shek 's illegal rule of Taiwan should not permit the confusion of treating Taiwan as one of the two rival parties in a Chinese civil war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Chinese quarrels . The Taiwanese do not welcome Peking 's rule , nor do they accept Chiang 's regime as the legal Taiwan Government . What the Taiwanese want is an independent Republic of Taiwan , free from Chinese influence . The Times 's editorial seems ' to imply that because of their majority in the population , the Taiwanese will inevitably play an important role in Taiwan 's future . This is hardly true in a country ruled by totalitarian dictatorship , sudh. as Chiang 's in Taiwan . I would like to point out that the Taiwanese , who compose 85 per cent To the Editor : The multiple hijackings are over , the planes destroyed , ransoms paid and hostages freed . What are the obvious lessons ? The ? British were generous to the girl air pirate who attempted to hijack an El Al plane . The ? plane was not scheduled to land in London . Why did they not make her stay on the plane and continue her flight ? They permitted her to enter Britain and were rewarded for their generosity with Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passengers held as hostages . In Switzerland , Greece and Germany , Arab terrorists are free to commit crimes including murdering Greek children . Trials and convictions are irrelevant . Convicted criminals are freed when their gangster friends hi-jack another plane . In the understand . able anxiety over safety of hostages , justice and punishment for criminals are forgotten . Why not extradite such criminals immediately to Israel for just and humane punishment ? With no ransom to pay , Europeans would then be immune to bacImmil. - Americans have been hit hardest by air piracy . Yet the United States Government does nothing against air pirates and proposes additional taxes on American travelers to finance new security measures . American travelers and taxpayers are penalized for the failure of the United States Government to control air piracy . Victiins are punished and criminals are rewarded. - The.United States Government is responsible for the freedom of Americans to travel everywhere . ' The Arab terrorists and their supporters should pay for destroyed aircraft and new security procedures . The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine operates legally with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their nationals pay for damages and expenses caused by air piracy , rather than the American taxpayer . Hitting of the population on the island , have only 2 per cent representation in the congress . Not a single Taiwanese has ever been appointed as police chief at county level , not even to mention any higher positions . Unless and until the political structures in Taiwan undergo a drastic change , the Taiwanese political voice will remain inaudible . ? There are no two Chinas ; there is only one Taiwan and one China . The only and easiest way to solve the socalled China problem is to give up the legend that Taiwan is part of China , and to restore the right of self-determination to the people on Taiwan . The Taiwanese people want ' Taiwan to be independent , free and exclusive of any political tie with China , whether it be under Chiang or Mao .. Wilms C. CHANG Murray Hill , N. J. , Nov. 1 , 1970 U.N . Seat for China Opposed To the Editor : Current efforts to exploit Canada 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to gain admission for that regime to the United Nations are almost certainly doomed to failure , and they should be . What is involved here are the pledges made in President Nixon 's State of the World Message and elsewhere that the United States will not abandon the Republic of China on Taiwan , and will accordingly sustain its recognition of it , sustain the mutual defense treaty between the United States and the Republic of China , and will not sacrifice ' the legitmate position of the Republic of China in the U.N . Secretary of . State Rogers made it clear , in his statement of Aug. 6 to the House . Foreign Affairs subcommittee on international organizations and movements , that the United States would not agree to seating the . Chinese Communists in the United Nations . He based this upon the insistence of the Chinese Communist regime that the price of its entrance into the U.N . would continue to be the expulsion of the Republic of Coma from that body .. As a Matter of fact , the . Chinese Communists continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.N . will suffice if they are to enter it . They have repeatedly demended that not only the Republic of China but a number of other . ( unspecified ) so-called " puppet " states must also be expelled , that the Charter be revised according to their own unilateral demands , etc . The consistent annual refusal of the U.N . General Assembly to go along with these demands is at the very least legally and morally justified by the facts . By contrast with the Mao regime , the Republic of China has always scrupulously observed its obligations under both the letter and the spirit ' of the U.N . Charter . On the other hand , the series of domestic and international crimes committed by the Mao regime them in their pocketbooks may bring them to their senses . Nationals of such countries should be charged $100 for entry visas . Students from these countries should not - be subsidized by American taxpayers and should pay their full share of the cost of running a university , rather than a symbolic tuition fee . American government funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the so-called refugee camps and the American University in Beirut , which proudly admit over American television that terrorists are trained there . The funds could be diverted to reimburse T.W.A. and Pan Am for their losses in destroyed aircraft . Support for genuine humanitarian and educational purposes should not be stopped . Bona fide Arab students should not be penalized if they sign an oath that they do not support ? terrorist activities . But the American Government should know what it is doing , and should not use taxpayers ' money to subsidize terrorism and air piracy . HARRY J. , Luncsat Rehovoth , Israel , Nov. 4 , 1970 The writer , a U.S. citizen , is Professor of Physics at The Weizmann Institute of Science . in the last twenty years must effectively relegate it to the status of an . outlaw vis- ? - vis international society . The admission of Red China to the U.N . could not but lead inevitably to a disastrous erosion of that organization 's standing as a general supporter of an international order based on law and comity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that organization of one of its original members which has steadily supported it and participated honestly and sincerely in its work , on the demand of the Mao regime which has steadily flouted it and has , in fact , been condemned by the U.N . as an aggressor . Those vihourge the admission of the Mao regime to the U.N . should perhaps themselves undertake the task , seemingly beyond the capability of any of the world 's governments , of getting Mao to agree to a " two Chinas " policy in the U.N. , something to which both the Mao regime and the Republic of China are unalterably opposed : Until and unless they can , their advocacy of U.N . admission for Red China is an exercise in irresponsibility . DAVID N. ROWE Yale University JOSEPH KAPLAN University of California , L.A. New Haven , Nov. 4 , 1970 The letter was also signed by fourteen other scholars at various institutions in the United States Lindsay Switch Opposed To the Editor : Since the election I have been reading reports that unnamed Democratic leaders in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and.even , believe it or not , ' to become a Democratic leader . Mine is one small voice which will be raised against this . Mayor Lindsay 's participation in this year 's campaign was not noticeably helpful to Arthur Goldberg .. And it was disastrous for Richard Ottinger , the one Democrat who had a chance . Lindsay 's appeals for votes on the Liberal line  --  a **25;613;TOOLONG combination , really doomed Ottinger. - In the statewide totals , according to The Times of Nov. 5 , the margin between Buckley and Ottinger was roughly 102,000 votes . Goodell got 226,000 votes on the Liberal line alone . I hope Mayor Lindsay and his Liberal party associates are happy that they assisted so ? materially in the election of Buckley . Now , because ' Lindsay realizes that the Liberal party alone is ? ot enough of a base to use for launching a na " - tonal effort , he expects the Demcicrats to give him a home . From there he can proceed to block the prospects of some Democrats who might ' stand a chance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were from the Democratic party to Buckley in 1970 , end away from ? Goldberg as well . It is equally apparent in what areas and among what groups these defections were greatest . These people are not wedded to any right-wing conservative philosophy , and in their hearts they will never be happy outside the Democratic party . Turning to Lindsay will be telling these people to make their defec : - don permanent . However , we can not forge a winning coalition without them . Lindsay offers no hope to me . GEORGE E. WHALEN Member , N. Y. State Democratic Committee , 97th A.D. Dover Plains , N. Y. , Nov. 5 , 1970 0 Nonparticipation of Youth To the Editor : In his " negative view " of Consciousness III in " The Greening of America , " Herbert Marcuse Op . Ed. article Nov. 6 revealed himself a true materialist . He writes of the state as if unaware that any state is no more than a hierarchy of offices and as insubstantial as the divine right of kings . But one Wonders how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in referring to them he seems so obtuse . The radicalism of nonparticipation and of withdrawal is the most insidious of all radicalism , because it is impossible to apprehend . And it can bring the house down by emptying all the boxes. , Not only will certain of the young not enter a place of work , but people everywhere are moving out of churches , deserting concert balls , vacating central cities . The young are moving out of conventional molds of ' wedlock in favor of a communal life . The young are shying away from big corporations , big law firms , big banking and bigness in ' any form . One hears them increasingly speak . of " light " within . Grotesque as the forms , the drugs , the " rock " to us , we are nevertheless witnessing without comprehending the emergence of Arnold Toynbee 's internal proletariat , those who are in but not of a society , and the hard , unattended birth of spiritual radicalism .
