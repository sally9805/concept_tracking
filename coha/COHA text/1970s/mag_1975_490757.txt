THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment SHORTLY after the jury in the Watergate trial handed down its verdicts , John Ehrlichman , H. R. Haldeman , and John Mitchell emerged briefly from the courtroom to say a few words to the press . Their pictures were in the paper the next morning , and we scrutinized the faces closely . Ehrlichman , insisting that he had been convinced even before the trial began that it would not he a fair one , and butting against all known facts in his customary way , declared , " Nothing that has happened today has changed my mind . " Yet something in Ehrlich-man 's face , at least , had changed , Something on the inside , it seemed to us , was beginning to erode and rearrange that " stone wall " the country had looked at for so long . We were reminded that in his defense at the trial Ehrlichman had at least admitted the existence of a coverup , though he had attempted to shift the blame for it onto his former colleague , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of the truth had penetrated Ehrlichman 's world , if only for reasons of self-protection . For Haldeman , there were no such ambiguities . His mind was clear . When he emerged , he did not merely drop a few casual remarks to reporters but stepped right up to the microphone with a statement to make . " There 's only one human being in the world who knows to an absolute moral certainty the truth of my innocence or guilt , " he said . " That person is me , and I know that , legally and morally , I 'm totally and absolutely innocent . " Of all the defendants , Haldeman had been the most consistent throughout the Watergate affair . He had maintained his and the President 's innocence from the beginning to the end . He had also been the remotest from reality . As far as he was concerned , the thousands of pages of documents and the hundreds of hours of television we had all seen in the last two years had uncovered nothing that was unseemly or culpable in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again the inverted moral order that prevailed in the Nixon White House . There a strong man was one who succumbed to White House pressure to commit crimes . A trustworthy man was one who could be relied on to lie to a grand jury . On one occasion , at least , ordinal- ) moral standards were doubly inverted . In 1971 , Patrick Buchanan , a speech writer for President Nixon , noted in a memorandum that the plan to harass Daniel Ellsberg would be " good for the country " but " would not , it seems to me , be particularly helpful to the President politically . " The idea that a piece of repression would be " good for the country " was already morally inverted , but Buchanan inverted morality again and decided that the benefit to the country should be forgone in favor of the President 's political advantage . In Buchanan 's world , idealism counselled repression , but pragmatism ruled against it . When Mitchell came out of the courtroom and was asked if he planned to take a vacation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon . " From the look on his face , it seemed that inwardly he was on the moon already . In his expression was a world of weariness and woe . Yet we found that in the Watergate lineup Mitchell 's face was somehow a relief . On his face alone did the entire story of the Nixon Administration 's tremendous fall seem to be written . From his distant look one could guess that the ordeal had left its mark on his mind and spirit , and that he had long ago abandoned the faith that Haldeman was now championing with redoubled zeal . Here was at least veiled recognition of what we had all been through in the last few years . Mitchell , unlike the others , seemed to know everything we knew . Gatherings LAVING the Vice-President aside , we wish to report on the Rockefeller Public Service Awards , which have been given annually since 1952 out of the capacious pocket of John I ) .

One hundred and fort ) nominations were received in 1974 . The Woodrow Wilson School , consulting files and conducting interviews , winnowed them down to a more manageable number , and from these , over a hardworking two days last October , Dr. Wood 's committee made the final selection . We take our work seriously , " Jane P. Cahill , a selector who is vice-president of communications of I.B.M. , said after joining us . " It 's a very interesting panel . We have a great respect for each other . We get to Princeton Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make our choices Saturday morning . We fight in a polite sort of way . I 'm struck by the incredible talent in the bureaucracy . It 's really the cornerstone of our democratic system . " " I gather we 're having the President today , " Dr. Wood said as , along with about four hundred men and women , many of them previous Award winners , we moved into the next room for lunch . A few minutes later , to be sure , after Dr. William G. Bowen , president of Princeton , had introduced the people on the dais ( Elliot Richardson was the only one wearing an odd jacket ) , President Ford came in , escorted by Ruth Greenstein , assistant dean of the Woodrow Wilson School . All rose from their untouched grapefruit . The President was wearing a blue suit , a blue-striped shirt , and a blue de with some kind of animal on it . Mr. Rockefeller had a small , tight dark-red rose in his buttonhole . They both sat down . Dr. Bowen then yielded the rostrum to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly and amused , made a short speech : " Pleased and honored to join in our salute . ...

Grace was pronounced by the Reverend Edgar D. Romig , rector of the local Episcopal Church of the Epiphany , and then the grapefruit was attacked .

This trophy , a medal bearing the likeness of the founder of the 0.5.5. , went to William J. Casey , an O.S.S. veteran and former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission , who is now president and chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States . It was bestowed , after more than four hours of eating , drinking , toastmastering , and speechmaking , at the . annual D.S.S. Veterans ' Dinner , held this year in the International Ballroom of the Washington Hilton Hotel . The dinner was attended by some six hundred black-tie-wearing guests , most of them O.S.S. alumni , who paid forty dollars each for the privilege , but there was also a generous sprinkling of foreign diplomats and other persons of distinction .

" Being Present THE newest museum in town is the International Center of Photography , which occupies the mansion that formerly served as headquarters for the National Audubon Society , on the northeast cornet- of Fifth Avenue and Ninety-fourth Street . The week before its recent gala opening , we talked with Cornell Capa , its executive director , and with Karl Katz , one of the moving spirits behind it . The Center will exhibit , teach , and publish photography , and will set up archives for the preservation of photographs . It grew out of the International Fund for Concerned Photography , founded in 1966 by M r . Capa , who was one of the most eminent photographers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dedicated to the memory of three photojournalists who were killed in the nineteen-fifties while on picture assignments : David Seymour ( Chim ) , Verner Bischof , and Robert Capa ( Cornell 's older brother ) . All this we learned from Mr. Katz , an ebullient man of forty-five , who is Chairman for Special Projects of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , while lunching with him in the staff dining room of the Met . " The Center will be concentrating on photography as a means of communication rather than as art , " Mr. Katz told us . " It is interested in committed photojournalism  --  in documentary photography , which no longer has an outlet , now that the big picture magazines have folded . Documentary photography could he said to fall into two broad categories . " Mr. Katz had brought a pile of hooks to lunch and had put them on the chair next to him . He reached for one , " The Concerned Photographer , " edited by Cornell Capa , and riffled through it . " Here . This says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He pointed to the lines " Lewis W. Hine , an early **26;4815;TOOLONG , may have stated it best : ' There were two things I wanted to do . I wanted to show the things that had to he corrected . I wanted to show the things that had to be appreciated . ' " Mr. Katz shut the book and continued , " Well , that 's what it 's all about . Now , at last , Cornell has a place of his own . It 's been a long time coming . This brilliant , absolutely lovable man , a Hungarian who murders the English language , has never had the recognition he deserves , because he has n't wanted it . He 's always doing things for other people . He has put together exhibitions for all the great museums  --  for the Library of Congress , the Jewish Museum , the Metropolitan . Any time those places want a guest photography exhibit , they call Cornell and he drops everything . And he 's done eleven books  --  some of his own pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best . This guy 's been a friend , a father figure , a teacher to anyone who cares about photography . Some of us felt we could n't let him go on dispersing his talent , his energy . He had to have a place where he could teach , and where he could reach more people . Somehow we got a little seed money from foundations . Cornell found this lovely house . And now  --  Well , you 'll see . " Accompanied by Mr. Katz , we left the Metropolitan and walked up the Park side of Fifth Avenue in bright sunlight . We stopped at the corner of ? Ninety-fourth Street and looked across at the facade of what is still known as Audubon House , a six-story Georgian building of red brick , with shiny black shutters . Lovely it is . We crossed the street and looked at the metal plaque by the front door ; I AXDMARKS OF NEW YORK AUD1-DON HOUSE DELAN AN D ALDRICH WERE THE ARCHITECTS OE THIS GEORGIAN STYLE MANSION , COMPLETED ABOUT 1915 FOR WILLARD STRAIGHT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

MIN ITV TRL.S1 We walked into a circular , marble-floored entrance hall . A young girl with long hair and glasses sat at a table , talking into a telephone cradled on one shoulder , and filling envelopes with both hands . As she talked , a second phone kept ringing . She greeted Mr. Katz with a smile , and we headed up a broad marble stairway . On the second floor , we emerged into a long , ? high-ceilinged , wood-panelled room with a fireplace at one end and a handsome parquet floor . This was once the Straights ' reception room and is no%i called Gallery 2 . There we found a young man holding a metal rod Mr. Katz introduced him to us as Bhupendra Karia , an Indian photographer , who had been working with Cornell Capa for two years and is now the Center 's associate director . As we stood talking , Mr. Capa walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray hair , bushy eyebrows , and a smiling face . " There you are , " he said . " The baby is about to he born . We will make it for the opening . Come . I want to show you everything . " Mr. Capa put one arm around Mr. Katz and the other arm around us , and began to steer us through . " We have put the house hack exactly as it used to be , " he said . " When we moved in , there were many partitions ; which we have taken down . See the panelling ? We will never hurt it . We designed special hoards to hang pictures from , with metal rods . " He pointed to the rod that Mr. Karia was holding . " A genius who was produced by Karl Katz thought these up . But , like all geniuses , he made the rods so that they would n't fit the holes . Right , lihupendra ? " Mr. Karia smiled . Gallery 2 and a large wood-panelled room adjoining it were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apropos U.S.S.R. ( 1954 and 1973 ) , " made up of photographs taken by Henri Cartier-Bresson on two trips to Russia . On the opposite side , the reception room opened into a wood-panelled library , which had a large number of folding chairs stacked against the walls , and three tall windows facing Fifth Avenue . " Here we will have lectures , audiovisuals , conferences , " Mr. Capa said . Mr. Katz looked at his watch and said he had to get hack to the Metropolitan . Mr. Capa clapped him on the hack , said goodbye , and then led us upstairs to a large panelled room on the third floor . We both sat down in directors ' chairs of red canvas , drawn up to a Formica-topped table . This room , Mr. Capa explained , was to he used for master classes . Some of the leading photographers would come here once a week and conduct seminars . He went on to say that the Center would he the only museum in the country devoted exclusively to photography , except for the International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rochester , which was established in 1947 . " Modern Art and Whitney , they show photography , of course , " he said . " They buy a few negatives of the great photographers , but what happens to the rest ? I became concerned about that when , around the same rime , brother and Bischof and Seymour died . Al their negatives , all their life 's work -- I could save them . But what happens with the other photographers= The family puts their photographs in the attic , and one day they get thrown out . All the history of the twentieth century will be in photographs  --  more than in words . " Capa stood up . " Come . I want you to meet some of the young people who are with me here , " he said . " Some of them come all the way from California . The door will be open from eleven in the morning till eleven at night  --  maybe later . Who knows , when a lot of photographers get going ? There will always he coffee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capa introduced us to a baby , held by a pretty , dark-haired young woman . " This is Colin Burroughs , three and one-half weeks , " Capa said . " And his beautiful mother , Wendy . His father runs the slide machine and works in the darkroom . " JANUARY 1 3 , 19 7 5 Downstairs , in the entrance hall , the longhaired young girl was still simultaneously talking on the telephone and filling envelopes . A bearded young man was squatting on the floor beside her with another telephone and an open telephone hook . He was introduced to us as David Kutz . He said , " Today a telephone operator , tomorrow an electrician , next day a carpenter , maybe one day a photographer . " We went back to Gallery 2 . The Cartier-Bresson exhibition was being hung . On a wall between two windows was a 1954 photograph of young Russians dancing in a club under giant posters of Lenin and Stalin . Mr. Karia was staring at it . A young girl approached him with two labels for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Which color do you want  --  milk chocolate or bittersweet ? " Mr. Karin chose bittersweet . Capa stood in front of the Cartier-Bresson photograph appraisingly for a moment , and then told us that Cartier-Bresson had recently given an interview to Le Monde in which he stated that painting , not photography , had always been his obsession , and that he drew every day and now considered his drawings much more important than his photography . The interview had caused an uproar in France , Le Monde had asked several French photographers to respond , and had printed the responses of , among others , Gilles Peress and Marc Rihoud . " Cartier-Bresson treated Rihoud like a son , " Capa went on . " He was his mentor , and now he tells him that photography does n't mean anything . So now everybody is responding . Errs-son is like that . Psst , Asst , Asst  --  the steam gathers , then the lid blows off . " He smiled . " The whole thing is so French : love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So now we have these vibrations crossing the ocean . " From the library we could hear a measured voice on a loudspeaker . It was Cartier-Bresson . " That 's the Master 's voice , " Capa said to us , pointing through the door . " You should go and watch his audiovisual . We will have it running all through his exhibition . " We went into the library and sat down on a folding chair . The room was dark and empty . Cartier-Bresson slides flicked on and off a screen , and Cartier-Bresson spoke , in almost unaccented English : " Sometimes people ask , ' How , many pictures do you take ? ' . Well , there is no rule . Sometimes , like in this picture in Greece , well , I saw the frame of the whole thing and waited for somebody to pass .... That is why it develops a great anxiety in this profession .. always waiting .

It is these tensions I am always moved by .... I love life . I love human beings . I hate people also .... I enjoy shooting a picture , being present . It 's a way of saying , Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! ' ... And there 's no maybe . " Meetings MT HAT Mary Tyler Moore and Robert Penn Warren have in common , in addition to three names each , is that neither was in New York last weekend . Normally , this would not be a cause for great concern , but on that weekend they were both supposed to be in town  --  Miss Moore to receive an award from the Popular Culture Association and Mr. Warren to preside at a meeting of the Melville Society . The Popular Culture Association and the Melville Society are loosely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that meets in New York every two years and that on such occasions is responsible for a dramatic influx of beards and knitted-wool neckties in midtown . The Popular Culture Association met Friday evening in the Sutton Ballroom of the New York Hilton . We spoke with Marshall Fishwick , an ex-president of the P.C.A. , who told us that the organization was formed in 1969 as an offshoot of American Studies . He told us that , rather than concentrate upon what he called " elite culture , " the P.C.A. makes a point of recognizing the Irving Wallaces and Bob Hopes of the world . Because we knew what the P.C.A. is , we were a step ahead of most of the two hundred and fifty other people in the room , virtually all of whom had come merely to see Mary Tyler Moore . NVe sat in the second row , behind Nancy A. Roediger , of Tarrant County Junior College . " I 'm in the front row because I want to see how old Mary Tyler Moore looks , " Mrs. Ruediger told us . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else listened to a panel discussion of how to create a best-seller . At the outset of the discussion , Peter Renchley , the author of the best-selling novel " Jaws , " said that there is no such thing as " creating a best-seller " and that he certainly made no deliberate effort to write one . Thomas . Lask , assistant cultural editor of the Times , said , " It is impossible to write a best-seller , but it 's not impossible to create one . " Julie Coryn , a publicity director for a publishing house , declared that the best way to make a best-seller is to have editors in publishing houses find good writers to write good books . She also spoke about what she called " accidental " best-sellers . While this was going on , the crowd buzzed in anticipation of the arrival Miss Moore and Andy Warhol , the evening 's other honoree . About ten minutes after Mr. Warhol arrived , Ray Browne , an officer of the P.C.A. , interrupted the panel discussion to announce that Mary Tyler Moore would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to present Mr. Varhol with a large framed certificate citing his " distinguished achievements in the popular arts . " Mr. Warhol , who was holding a small tape recorder , said " Thank you . " Then the meeting broke up . Afterward , Andy Warhol told us that he plans to run a picture of the award on the cover of his next book , and that he hopes the book will be a best-seller . THE next day , when the Melville Society met , at the New York Public Library , Sanford Marovitz , the program chairman , announced Robert Penn Warren 's absence by saying , " All the kjng 's men are here , but the king is not " Before settling down to scholarly matters which included the presentation of a paper about film versions of " Many Dick , " subtitled " Ahab Gets Girl " ? the Society discussed plans to meet in 1976 in Pittsfield , Massachusetts , where Melville wrote " Moby Dick . " Hennig Cohen , secretary-treasurer of the group , explained that the Melville Society had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the members could stay at the new , thirteen-story Colonial Hilton Inn there . He proposed a motion to acknowledge the invitation , and it passed . Then a parliamentary crisis arose . " Was that enough hands , " Mr. Cohen asked , " to say that we are willing to accept a formal invitation to Pittsfield , or is that presumptuous , and should we re-vote on the motion and if we defeat the motion then propose another motion , or ... Oh , I do n't know . The polling process is so difficult ! " Two friends of cetaceans addressed
