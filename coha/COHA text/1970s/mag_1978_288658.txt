The tip came from an Israeli police source . When he heard the news , TIME 'S David Halevy rushed from his home outside Tel Aviv and reached the scene of action before the bus captured by Palestinian terrorists burst into flames . The first journalist to arrive , Halevy got an eyewitness account of the battle with the terrorists that provoked last week 's crisis in the Middle East . <P> Five days later , Halevy again raced to a scene of bloodshed , this time in southern Lebanon , as the Israeli army retaliated against Palestinian terrorist bases . Again he had a vantage point : he and Photographer David Rubinger were among the first newsmen who managed to get to the battlefield during the actual invasion . Rubinger 's pictures and Halevy 's reporting-along with the files of six other TIME correspondents who covered the combat-are part of this week 's cover story , the 14th on the Middle East that we have run during the past four years . <P> While the fighting flared in Lebanon , TIME 'S congressional correspondent , Neil MacNeil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equally historic , if quite different , event : the Senate 's vote on the first of two Panama Canal treaties . In the tense days that preceded the vote , MacNeil spent much of his time walking the corridors and working the back rooms of the Senate , dogging key figures he has known over the years and listening to their speculations . MacNeil also had access to the head counts of both sides , and constantly compared them with his own as Jimmy Carter launched his full-scale assault on wavering Senators that finally carried the day . <P> As the debate went on , reports MacNeil , " I was struck by a the extraordinary range , for good and ill , of the talents and tempers of the Senators . On one hand , there were members who scarcely concealed their fears sand self-serving cravenness on this difficult vote . On the other hand , there were men of patience , understanding and quiet courage in both camps . " <P> But when the final arguments had been heard and the lobbying had ceased , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says MacNeil : " The mood in the great hall as the roll was called was one of awe . Rarely is a vote so important that those present fall into such a silence , and there has not been one in Congress like this since the House Judiciary Committee , in a similar hush , voted the first article of impeachment against Richard Nixon .
