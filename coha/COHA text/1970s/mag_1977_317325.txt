From Detroit Bureau Chief Edwin Reingold : <P> The coldest winter in nearly a century dropped temperatures last week to - 11 F. in Chicago , - 31 F. in Minneapolis and - 54 F. in Solon Springs , Wis . Cracked a farmer in Bayfield County , Wis. : " It was so cold that my wheelbarrow would n't start . " To most Midwesterners , keeping warm was a much more compelling concern than what kind of President Jimmy Carter would make . <P> Because of a natural-gas shortage , public schools closed in Kansas City , Mo. , and may be cut to three days a week in Dayton . Too much demand caused electric voltage to be reduced by 5% in Detroit and other parts of Michigan , which dimmed lights almost imperceptibly and assured that everyone got some current . As an added misery , the wells ran dry in the farm hamlet of Princeton , Kans. , and people had to truck in water . But much of it was frozen , and some citizens had to use snow to flush their toilets . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of them sounded upbeat . Said Donald Percy , a vice president at the University of Wisconsin : " Our mood now is one of quiet expectancy . " Still , as Marquette University Sociologist Wayne Youngquist pointed out , Carter " does n't have a great reservoir of partisan feeling to draw on as a kind of cushion . He 's going to have to produce . " Added Theologian Martin Marty of the University of Chicago : " A lot of married couples forgo the honeymoon cruise and take up housekeeping right away . He 's going to have to do that , " <P> People in rural areas were afraid that even though Carter will be the first farmer in the White House since Thomas Jefferson , a peanut grower may not understand corn-belt problems . Because of unseasonably dry and cold weather this winter , the Midwest may end up at harvest time with unusually low yields in such high-income crops as corn and soybeans . <P> Until they find out what Carter will do to cushion wide fluctuations in the prices for their crops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others anticipate a consumer rebellion over higher prices and are already explaining on TV that a loaf of bread contains only 3 to 4 worth of wheat . Still , there is an underlying confidence , which is demonstrated by the seller 's market for prime agricultural land . In a year the price has risen by 28% , to $2,000 an acre , outside Cedar Rapids , Iowa , and by 45% , to $4,000 an acre , near Peoria , Ill . <P> Businessmen were reassured by Carter 's Cabinet choices . Said a top General Motors Corp . executive : " Whatever decisions he makes , he will at least have the advice of people who know our problems . " Moreover , the Midwestern economic outlook is improving . Detroit hopes to sell close to 10 million cars and 3.5 million trucks this year , thus putting to work many of the 39,000 unemployed auto workers . In turn , the steel and tire industries are heading for a good year , and the prosperity will trickle down to the rest of the region 's economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma in Tulsa , Okla. : " I 'm relaxed and optimistic .
