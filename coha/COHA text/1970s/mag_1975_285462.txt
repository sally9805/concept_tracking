In a surge of reforming zeal , California 's voters last June approved a clean-government referendum known as Proposition Nine , which was as confused in its meaning as it was noble in its intent . A commission is now hard at work trying to figure out what the 20,000-word provision allows and what it forbids . But in the interim , the panel has passed the word that anyone employed by the state government should play it safe and accept no gifts from lobbyists . <P> Thus Beverlee Manley , an analyst for an assembly committee , does not al low her lobbyist husband to buy her din ner . There is some doubt that Sarah Michael , a consultant for another committee , could legally accept an engagement ring from Bernie Mikell , her boy friend , since he works as a lobbyist for the California Savings and Loan League . The state 's assemblymen have sworn off the free orange juice , dough nuts , ice cream and milk that traditionally have been donated by outside interests . <P> A more baffling problem has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capitol lawn in Sacramento . For years , Assemblyman Eu gene Chappie has been feeding the squirrels with samples provided by the Northern California Walnut Growers Association . Daunted by Proposition Nine , Chappie thought at first that he would have to find some walnuts grown on state land to keep the squirrels from becoming a vanishing breed . But then Assemblyman Edwin L. Z'berg won 50 Ibs. of walnuts in a raffle , which he promptly gave to Chappie . Now other assemblymen are anteing up a buck apiece for a nut fund to keep the squirrels gamboling as happily as in the days before Proposition Nine altered the ways and means of everyone 's life in Sacramento .
