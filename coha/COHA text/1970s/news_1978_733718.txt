Letters Carey-Krupsak Contest : The Real Issues ' To the Editor : Traditionally , in political campaigns , political reporters and analysts tend to advance a major theme for each campaign and write their articles around that theme . The Krupsak candidacy is no exception . Understandably . considering the nature of her announcement , the theme advanced by political reporters , including your own Frank Lynn . has centered on Mary Ann 's being with the Governor one day and against him only a few days later . The questions most often asked by the press concern this apparent turnabout . While this theme is certainly justified considering recent events , it has the unfortunate effect of preventing a discussion of the real issues on which the gubernatorial primary should be Crime Protection To the Editor : The news article by Peter Kihss on " Mob 's Role Discounted in Gambling " ( June 26 ) was extremely interesting . I have been an admirer of the work of Jonathan B. Rubenstein since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately , Mr. Rubenstein and Mr. Reuter state in their current study that gambling arrests in New York City had declined from 11,467 in 1965 to 5,949 in 1971 and 1,394 in 1975 because " gambling enforcement had become a low-priority activity . " The fact of the matter is that the decline was due to political pressure from 1965 to 1975 . From 1971 to 1975 ( and up to the present ) the decline was mandated by the Police Department hierarchy , which did not want gambling arrests by the uniformed patrol officers . The real reason for this move by the police hierarchy was well pinpointed by the Knapp Commission : the inability of the ranking police administrators to stop corruption . The police administrators solution : no arrests by patrol officers except under specified guidelines ; the hierachy must protect its image . Mr. Rubenstein will find a similar decline in street narcotic arrests by uniformed police officers . Did this policy of hands off street gamblers and narcotics pushers stop corruption ? Of course not ; just review the records of the Special Prosecutor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits increased . The real pawns : the police officer and the community . In closing , let me add that during 1965 to 1975 I was commanding officer of three detective squads and three police precincts in New York City . HUGH J. B. CASSIDY Stony Brook , L.1. , July 4 , 1978 Prime Inflation Fighter To the Editor : Inflation is now the meanest threat to the welfare of our country . Only by legally enforceable wage and price controls can this menace be opposed successfully . No other action has been suggested that can be seriously effective . Such controls worked very well twice in the past , with only insignificant faults . Its opponents are primarily those who now have the power to inflict rising prices and wages . SIDNEY JARCHO Yorktown Heights , N.Y. , July 8 , 1978 fought . As the Democratic state com ? mitteeman who nominated Mary Ann Krupsak at the Albany convention , I would like to state what this campaign is about in terms ofissues . I think we must start by realizing that a new group of Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter Democrats " is probably their most accurate label . These Democrats have rejected the fundamental philosophy of Roosevelt , Truman , Kennedy and Johnson : that the government has a responsibility for redressing social wrongs and improving the lot of the disadvantaged . Whether it be Carter in the White House or Carey in the State House , these Democrats have adopted the " trickle down " theory of government and economics , which holds that the Why West Germans Wo n't See ' Holocaust ' To the Editor : Try as one can , it just is n't possible to be rid of anxiety concerning the sodal and political health of West Germany . Refusal of that country 's largest television network to include " Holocaust " in its programming news story July 3 confirms this judgment . Granted that " Holocaust " might not have been the best rendition of that horrendous episode in recent German history , it 's still better than nothing . For Peter Schulze-Rohr , program director of Stidwestfunk , to brand the series as " garbage " is unacceptable . No less satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costuming and for a writer 's interpretive license to insert the visits of relatives to Buchenwald inmates . Such details , he says , would confuse a German audience , notably its youth . Which is preferable , one can retort , ignorance or confusion ? Some knowledge or none ? The attitude of Peter Schulze-Rohr and that of other West Germans who oppose the showing of " Holocaust " is a baleful indication that a significant percentage of the population does n't wish to be reminded of the Nazi past , even for objective and therapeutic reasons . Added to the recent right-wing violence in the Federal Republic , this incident forcefully argues that the embers of National Socialism still burn in that country C. H. ARLES Rockville , Md. , July 4 , 1978 To the Editor : " Taking On the Undertakerleditorial July 2 seems to be a major sport in this country today . When the President of the United States ( past and present ) " takes on the press " everyone hides behind the freedom-ofpress bit . Perhaps undertakers could , if they had at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of choice " that every American is entitled to . Since when has it been a newspaper 's job to dictate what people must do about burying their dead ? Burying one 's dead always has been a very personal thing , which the Federal Government or the press should have very little to say about . No one ' has taken the time to print the good things about funeral directors . The only picture that you found fit to print was that drawn by Jessica Mitford , which seems strange to me . She has certainly made huge amounts of money from belittling the funeral directors and on top of that gets free exposure in your paper . It might interest you to know that most of the funeral homes in this country are small " mom and pop " type operations , and they are among the few remaining service businesses where individuals dedicate a lifetime of understanding , helping and " getting involved " with the people they answer to social problems is giving benefits to business , which will in turn trickle down to the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state committee supported Governor Carey in his veto of the death penalty , his funding of Medicaid abortions and his efforts to provide financial assistance to the beleaguered cities of the state , we felt he had absolutely no concept of the role of government in alleviating problems of unemployment , housing , education , health or transportation . In fact , state programs in these areas are virtually a void . What this campaign is really about is a contest between two opposing political philosophies . On the one hand is the traditional Democratic philosophy , whether reflected in the W.P.A. and C.C.C . of Roosevelt , the national health insurance program of Truman , the Peace Corps of Kennedy or the War on Poverty of Johnson : that the government must have a direct role in providing jobs , housing , education , public transportation and health care for all its citizens . On the other hand is the political philosophy espoused by Governor Carey : that the function of government is to cut taxes and provide benefits for the business community . Mary Ann Krupsak , in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the people in various areas of the state . She has correctly pointed out that she has visited areas with problems , whether they be dairy farms or changing neighborhoods , has sat down with the people who live in those areas and has discussed possible solutions to their problems . The implication is clear : Where the assistance of the state government can help improve the quality of life of its citizens , Mary Ann will commit her administration to providing that assistance . As the campaign develops , specific position papers will be issued to present in more detail Mary Ann Krupsak 's programs in various areas . I hope this will permit a changing of the theme for the campaign now advanced by the political reporters to one which emphasizes the substantial difference in the approach to government between Governor Carey and Lieutenant Governor Krupsak . The choice for the voter will then be clear , and we have the utmost confidence that those who vote in the Democratic primary will support the traditional Democratic philosophy of government involvement in social problems and reject the new philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , July 5 , 1978 serve and the community they live in . By far the greater number of funeral directors in this country are community-minded and are " neighborhood friends . " The funeral director is on call 24 hours a day , is there when people need him and , according to Federated Funeral Directors of America , nets about $150 per funeral . If a person making $300 a week buys a $20,000 yacht , no one gets too upset . Let him buy a $2,500 funeral , and everyone gets in the act . Does n't seem fair to me . Yes , there have to be some bad apples in the funeral industry , and certainly they should be thrown out . But by and large the funeral industry serves a need in this country and is doing a superb job .. Even the F.T.C. report is based on a very minute percentage of the total . Perhaps it is time that someone did an in-depth study of the good points of funeral service rather than slanting the reports just to sell papers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have dedicated my life to serving my community and my friends . I am proud of this . I am willing to bet that 99 percent of the people I have served would agree that they got their money 's worth and a whole lot more . E. F. DROWN Ellenburg Depot , N.Y. , July 3 , 1978 The Dedicated Funeral Directors New Jersey Public Schools : The Aims of a 1975 Law To the Editor : Few issues have a more profound impact on the conduct of government ? today and on the opportunities of our children in the future than the financing of public schools . Since New York , Connecticut and many other states ' , now have this issue before them , it is important that information about programs in states which have begun to face the problem be full and accurate . New Jersey 's Public School Education Act of 1975 redesigned the state 's system for governing local education and altered its program for financing local school districts . This law , like many school finance topics , sometimes lends itself to simplistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of new state aid which the 1975 act directed to the 23 districts with the lowest per-pupil property values . This ignores the fact that New Jersey increased its state payments to local school districts by almost $250 million in the half decade before the 1975 act went into effect . Of this money , 45 percent went to these 23 districts , even though they included only 13 percent of the state 's public school pupils . As a result , the state 's share of local budget expenditures in these districts increased from 34 percent in 1971-72 to 57 percent in 1975-76 , before the 1975 law was implemented . New Jersey 's 1975 act was intended to extend this partially equalizing system to more districts . It is too early to demonstrate conclusively whether this has been accomplished , but the trends appear to be moving in the desired directions . The percent of school districts with budgeted per pupil expenditures within 10 percent of the statewide average has increased from 40 in 1975-76 to 42 in 1976-77 , to 46 in 1977-78 . Furthermore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts now approximates 65 to 70 percent . Excluding the special case of Newark , these 23 districts have increased their per pupil expenditures under the new law more rapidly than the state average , even though they have enjoyed the greatest decline in property tax rates . New Jersey 's 1975 Public School Education . Act did more than distribute aid . . It focused on the education of children and established a set of procedures to hold school districts account able for their own performance . The act obliges the Commissioner of Education to review school programs and expenditures , and it gives the Commissioner the authority to direct districts to change those programs or increase those expenditures if they are not constitutionally adequate . Only accurate research can help determine if the program is working as we had hoped , and only informed commentary can help shape whatever im- , provements may be necessary .
