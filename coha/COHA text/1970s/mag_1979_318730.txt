A flood of Christmas cards , a challenge to Khomeini , an exit for the Shah <P> On a crisp evening last week , Amy Carter stepped up to a podium on the Ellipse , just south of the White House , and pressed the button controlling the lights on a 30-ft. blue spruce and 50 smaller trees around it , one for each state . But for the first time since Calvin Coolidge began the tradition in 1923 , the big tree did not burst into light . Only the white star on its top and the tiny blue bulbs on the smaller trees blinked on . " Amy has lit 50 trees-one for each American hostage , " explained President Carter to the 7,500 surprised onlookers . " We will turn on the rest of the lights when the hostages come home . " The crowd was silent for a moment , then burst into applause . <P> In a similar outpouring of sympathy across the U.S. , hundreds of thousands of Americans sent Christmas cards to a strange address : <P> 260 Taleghani Avenue <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. embassy , which has been in the hands of fanatical followers of the Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini ever since Nov. 4 . No one knows for sure where the idea of sending Christmas messages to the hostages originated , but it caught on with amazing speed . On one day , postal officials sent about 44,000 pieces of mail to Iran . The next day , the total more than doubled . The messages were simple and from the heart . Scrawled an eight-year-old boy in Portland , Ore. : " We hope you are releesed soon . " In Tehran the militants guarding the U.S. embassy accepted the mail , and said some of it was being passed on to the hostages . <P> Meanwhile , the man who triggered the crisis by entering the U.S. last October for medical treatment-Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi-suddenly left the country last weekend for Panama . Early Saturday , the Shah with his family boarded an Air Force jet at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio , Texas , and flew to the Canal Zone , ending his 54-day stay in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials mentioned the lush resort island of Contadora off Panama 's Pacific coast . But Luz Maria Quijano de Murray , Panamanian consul general in Philadelphia , said the Shah will be given asylum for three months on Coi-bita Island , also off the Pacific coast . The arrangement , she added , " could become permanent . " <P> U.S. officials had been scrambling to find a suitable host country for the Shah since Mexico announced last month that he would not be allowed to return there . When Panama expressed interest last week in accepting the deposed monarch , Jimmy Carter dispatched White House Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan to Panama City to talk with Strongman Omar Torrijos Herrera . The two men had developed a good rapport during the Panama Canal treaty negotiations in 1977 , and after a long afternoon session with Jordan , Torrijos agreed to extend a firm invitation . <P> Washington obviously hopes that the Shah 's leavetaking will lead to the release of the hostages , even though the first reaction of their Iranian captors was not promising . " This will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militants about the Shah 's departure .
