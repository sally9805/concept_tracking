txt Lowell Thomas 's familiar face and voice will soon be asking employees of Sun Oil Company to reach into their pockets and make a political contribution . He will be the " star " of a short film to be shown in a staff briefing room . Soon after that , company president H. Robert Sharbarugh will be asking shareholders to do the same in a letter . Both requests for money are part of a major effort by Sun and other U.S. corporations to obtain money and involve employees in the political process . They are both legal ? and in a recent Supreme Court decision , Buckley v.-Valeo ? are upheld as ways corporations can give money to candidates . Employees will be able to choose from two methods of sending money to candidates . Either directly , or through a payroll deduction plan they can : ? Give money to their company 's political-action committee ( PAC ) ? in which case the company-controlled committee decides which candidates will receive the money . These committees will then choose which candidates to support . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influential Democrats might also be helped . The board chairman of Pfizer , Inc. , Edmund T. Pratt , says : We are most anxious to make contributions to candidates who support the free-enterprise system . " ? Put the money into a special-checking account , whose service fees are paid for by the company , and send it to candidates of their own choice , as they see fit . The Federal Election Commission will be responsible for monitoring abuses ? including any attempt to coerce employee contributions . One safeguard , suggested by the FEC and employed by Sun Oil , is simple : No boss can ask a subordinate for money ; any request must come from an employee of equal rank . It is hoped that the PAC system will allow corporations to avoid the many illegal , under-the-table contributions that cast a shadow over the 1972 political campaign . Besides Sun Oil , other major corporations registering PACs include : Texaco , Gerber Products , Montgomery Ward , Pillsbury , Allegheny Airlines , Boise Cascade , Citibank , and LTV Corporation . The Supreme Court decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of money an individual can donate to support a candidate , as long as the money is independently spent . . A corporation is also not limited in the amount of money it can spend to administer PACs and to solicit contributions from employees or stockholders . At a meeting held by the National Associ- *Please turn to Page 6 * U.S. firms to support candidates // ation of Manufacturers ( NAM ) in New York , executives of some 50 East Coast companies listened to Richard D. Godown , NAM 's chief counsel , and officials of Sun Oil and LTV Corporation explain the mechanics and benefits of setting up a PAC . The response was positive . Businessmen are cheered because they will be able to make campaign contributions much the same as COPE , the political-education arm of the AFL-CIO . However , they do n't expect to be able to collect an equivalent amount of money . COPE this year has already collected $5.5 million and spent $2.3 million , according to Mr. Pratt . In 1972 , COPE spent $8 million despite the fact it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV 's PAC cost the defense contractor $38,000 ? most of it spent to work out a payroll deduction system which would ensure the secrecy of the employees ' contribution . The system was investigated by the select Watergate committee , and the FBI , and no irregularities were discovered . Sun Oil , as part of its education program , sends its employees to Washington to meet their congressmen , see hearing rooms , and observe the democratic process .
