After years of kicking public television around as intolerably liberal and Eastern-oriented , the Nixon Administration seemed ready to settle its long war with the Public Broadcasting System . If public television would stop trying to be " a fourth network , " said Clay Whitehead , 35 , the President 's chief television adviser , the White House would press for the long-term federal financing that PBS officials felt was needed as insulation from political pressure . <P> PBS certainly carried out its part of the bargain . In the past 18 months , such liberal commentators as Sander Vanocur , Bill Moyers and Robert McNeil have disappeared from its schedule , although its public-affairs coverage has not been substantially reduced . It has also brought what the Administration fondly describes as " grassroots democracy " to the system by giving the nation 's 246 local PBS stations the budgetary power to control programming by buying or rejecting possible PBS shows in a form of program " auction . " Only those shows winning sufficient financial commitment from local stations will be included in the PBS lineup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his end of the deal . As reports filtering out of the White House have it , President Nixon " flatly rejected " a Whitehead-drafted bill that would have put federal support of public TV on a five-year basis and increased it from $60 million a year as of July 1 to $100 million by 1980 . In a fit of pique at the proposal , Nixon left word as he set off for the Middle East that he wanted to cut rather than raise PBS funding and , above all , keep it on the short leash of year-to-year financing . <P> Nixon 's switch deeply embarrassed Whitehead , who had planned to leave the White House after sealing the PBS deal . Whitehead personally leaked the story of Nixon 's turnabout , evidently in hopes of forcing his boss to reconsider . But " it will take a miracle to turn him around , " swears one Nixon aide . " He does not like public television , and probably never will . "                @ @ @ @ @
