 | The traffic light at the intersection changed . A flood of cars accelerated away from the corner , their lowered headlights reflecting in pools of the soft tar of the street . One set of headlamps , undimmed , lanced ahead , raking over the fronts of dingy brown-brick buildings and glinting in the eyes of a big black alley cat , scruffed and scarred from a thousand battles-royal . Blinded , the cat darted into the street and was caught beneath the rear wheel of the last car in the string . The car swerved slightly and pulled over to the curb and the driver , a balding man dressed in baggy gray slacks and a blue coat-sweater , got out . " What on earth did I hit ? " he muttered , looking around . " Oh , God , George ! " said the woman in the right front seat . " It was probably just a bump in the street . There 's enough of them , Lord knows . Why do n't they do something about the streets in this neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the street , " George said . " The front wheel did n't hit it and the back wheel did . I just hope it was n't a child . " " A child ? At this time of night ? It was probably just a dog or a cat . Or a rat , " she added , looking around with a shudder . " What 's wrong ? " demanded a sleepy voice from the back seat . " Your father 's trying to convince himself he 's a murderer because he ran over a dog or something . " " Daddy , did you kill a dog ? " " Be quiet , Stacey , " said George . " If it was a dog or something , then I want to make sure it is n't lying injured somewhere to go mad . " " You 're mad , George . Here we are sitting in the middle of this . . . this ... place , about to be robbed or knifed or . . . worse , and all you 're worried about is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , who had walked around to the back of the car , where he could see the mangled body dripping red blood and yellowish intestines on the pavement . " Good God ! " exclaimed the woman , leaning out her window and staring at the mutilated mass . " Did it scratch the paint ? " " Daddy , " Stacey said accusingly , " you are a murderer . " " George , let 's get out of here . That cat smells terrible . This whole neighborhood smells terrible . It 's giving me the willies . " George looked up and down the street , hands on hips . Then he turned and began to walk toward the open doorway beside the alley . " George ? George ! Where are you going ? Do n't you dare leave us alone . " " Just right here , Martha . Somebody may want to do something . " He walked on . Behind him he heard the windows being rolled up and door locks being engaged . He smiled to himself . Then he looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dark Shadows , and he stopped smiling . Leo , the **33;428;TOOLONG **30;463;TOOLONG of Lightnin ' Ed 's Bar and Grill , looked up from the glass he was polishing to see a **33;495;TOOLONG white man walk into his bar . Leo 's mouth fell open and he almost dropped the glass . One by one the faces along the bar turned to stare at the single pale face , shining in the dimness . " Yes , sir , cap'n , " Leo said uneasily , " what can we be doin ' for your ' George looked around nervously . " I , ah , had a little accident . I , ah , ran over a cat in the street , and I , uh , do n't know what to do about it . " " Whad he say ? " a wino at the far end of the bar , who claimed to be hard of hearing , whispered loudly . The jukebox ran out and fell silent just as somebody yelled to him , " Paddy says he run over some cat out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar . Conversation died . " Goddamn ! " said the wino . Leo leaned over the bar , letting his gigantic belly rest on the polished wood . " Yeah ? " he said to George . " Didja kill him ? " " Oh yes , " George assured him . " I made certain of that . " " Whad he say ? " demanded the deaf wino . Leo stared at George . " You pullin ' ma leg ? " " Of course not , " George snapped . " I ran over a cat in the street . Right outside . " " Well , " said Leo , " there 's a pay phone over there you can use to call the cops . But listen , was it right out in front a here ? " George nodded . " Well , listen , cap'n , seein ' as you 're in trouble anyways , you think you could maybe drag him down the street a ways ' fore the cops get here ? All that fuzz hangin ' ' round out front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Whad he say ? " demanded the wino . " Look , " George said , " I do n't want to call the po . . . the cops . There 's no need for that . The car was n't damaged . All I wanted was I ran over this cat and it 's all smashed and it 's lying right next to the sidewalk and I wanted a shovel or something to move it and put it in a garbage can or something . " Lightnin ' Ed 's knew a rare phenomenon  --  complete silence . It lasted for a long ten seconds before Leo sighed . " Whad he say ? " demanded the deaf wino.  | The answer was a multivoiced rumble . " He says he killed this cat on the street an ' he wants a shovel so 's he can hide him in a garbage can . " " Ai n't that just like a fuckin ' paddy ? " said Big Betsy the whore . " Look a here , cap'n , " said Leo , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alabama , you ca n't just go around hittin ' an ' runnin ' an ' tossin ' bodies into garbage cans . " " Solid ! " said a rat-faced man who clutched at a beer bottle . " You tell this sucker somethin ' , Leo , ' fore I lay this bottle upside his head . " " Look , " George said , spreading his hands and looking down the long row of hostile faces , " it was just one stray al ? " " Will you listen to the honky muthafucka , " snapped a dark-skinned man wearing a black beret . " Listen to him ! Cocksucker probly cheered when they offed Malcolm an ' cried buckets over Bobby Kennedy . We ought a waste the muthafucka , that 's what I say . " " You got it , brother , " said the rat-faced man , brandishing the beer bottle . " Whad he say ? " demanded the deaf wino . " Buddy , " said Leo , " if I was you , I 'd split . " George looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alley cat . " " Look , " Leo said , " I 'd just as soon kick the shit outa you maself , but I got ma business to be thinkin ' about an ' I ca n't . . . Whad you say ? " " I said it was just an alley cat . " " We ought a string the muthafucka up an ' cut his pasty balls off , " the man in the black beret was saying . " That 'd teach ' em they ca n't be comin ' ' round here runnin ' the People down in the street like we was animals . " " Amen , brother , " said the rat-faced man . " Hold it , people , " Leo said , waving his big arm . " It was n't nothin ' but an alley cat . " " An alley cat ? " said Big Betsy the whore . " Then what the hell 'd he wan na go makin ' out like he done killed somebody for ? " " He 's crazy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the black beret , " he 's a goddamn muthafuckin ' pale-faced honky . " " That 's what I said , " Leo snapped , and went back to polishing glasses . George stood by the bar , looking around and realizing that nobody was paying any attention to him any more except for the man in the black beret , who looked up from his gin occasionally to glare and snarl and mutter something under his breath . " Hey , " George said finally . Leo looked up at him . " What you want now ? " " What should I do about the cat ? "  | " Dann if I know , " said Leo . " It ai n't ma cat . " " It 's in front of your bar . " Leo regarded him sourly . " You drinkin ' somethin ' , cap'n , or you just cousin ' trouble ? " George looked at him for two seconds and then backed hastily out of the bar . When he reached the car he had to tap on the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " George , where have you been ? Why , Stacey and I could have been raped five times while you were in there ! Let me smell your breath . " " I thought they were going to kill me , " George said softly , staring through the windshield at the street . Suddenly he came to life , twisted his head , stared at Martha . " For a minute I honestly thought they were going to kill me . " He shook his head as if to clear it and began fumbling with his scat belt , trying to buckle it with shaking hands . " Of course they were , " Martha told him . " They 'd do it in a minute and think nothing of it . They are n't normal . Look at this neighborhood . Just look at it ! I do n't know why they live like this , I swear I do n't . " George started the car and pulled away from the curb . As the car accelerated , turned the corner , vanished into the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and onto the street . Leo corked the bottle of Old Colony gin and set the shot glass in front of the man with the black beret . " Rayburn , your woman ai n't gon na let you ' lone when you gets home half dead , " Leo warned . " Shit , " said Rayburn , adjusting his beret so that it hung down over his eye . " Shit . That bitch ai n't gon na be messin ' wid me . She knows who the man is . You gim me some beer to chase this here down with , an ' quit mindin ' ma wife . " " There 's enough people mindin ' your wife that one more ai n't gon na make no difference , " said the rat-faced man . " You take that back , you little piece of pigeon shit , " shouted Rayburn , hauling himself off the bar stool and pulling his beret lower on his head . " Look out , " warned Big Betsy . " Rayburn 's clearin ' for action . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands innocently . " I was only sayin ' what everybody knows . " Metal flashed in the dimness . " You clean your mouth , " Rayburn said dangerously , " or I'ma clean your throat . " " You ai n't gon na do shit , " said Leo , brandishing the carving knife he  | used to slice thick slabs of ham and beef for sandwiches . You put that blade away , Rayburn , or I'ma haul off an ' let you alone . An ' Elmo , you keep your shitty mouth shut , or you get the hell outa ma bar . " Rayburn slipped the razor back to wherever it had come from and sank onto the stool . " I'ma cut that mutha yet , " he muttered . " You cut , Elmo , " Leo said . " Cut the hell outa here . You know damn well Rayburn could slice you three times while you was gettin ' up enough nerve to say shit to a monkey . " Elmo gulped the rest of his beer and left quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stuck the knife savagely into a roast of beef . Rayburn glared at the empty doorway . " I could slice that mutha any time , " Rayburn said . " I know it , " Leo told him , " but that simple nigger ai n't even worth the time it takes to hate him . " " Humph , " said Rayburn , returning to his gin . " He 's right about your woman , you know , Rayburn , " Leo said softly . Rayburn looked up at Leo 's sagging jowls and clear soft eyes . " Yeah , Leo , " he said finally , " I know it . Fill me up again , hey ? " " Yeah , " Leo said , " sure . " He uncorked the bottle and poured the shot glass full . He looked down at Rayburn 's slumped shoulders , shrugged , and left the bottle standing uncorked on the bar . Big Betsy the whore laughed loudly , and Leo glanced down at her . " Hey , Leo , " yelled Big Betsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a drink . " Leo scrutinized the young man who sat next to Big Betsy . Leo had never seen him before . " What 'll it be ? " Leo asked . " The usual , " said Big Betsy . " What 's the usual ? " asked the young man . " Scotch and milk , " said Big Betsy . The young man made a face , looked at Leo . Leo shrugged silently . The young man smiled tightly . " Okay . One scotch and milk for the lady , and one plain scotch for me . " " Water on the side ? " Leo asked as he poured Big Betsy 's " scotch and milk " from the gallon carton that contained her private stock . The young man shook his head . Leo set up a shot glass full of scotch and Big Betsy 's drink and accepted a five-dollar bill . He went to the register and rang up one fifty , returned , and laid the change on the bar . The young man glanced at it , smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's drink . " I got this ulcer , " Big Betsy explained . The young man mumbled something . Big Betsy 's loud laugh echoed over the blare of the jukebox.  | " Hey , Leo , didja hear that ? " she guffawed , wiping greasy tears from her rheumy eyes . " Nope , " said Leo disinterestedly . " Whad he say ? " asked the deaf wino . " Ile said it musta been a plaid cow , ' cause there ai n't no other way there 's any scotch in this here glass . Haw , haw , haw . " Leo looked uncomfortably at the young man , who gave him another tight smile . Leo went back to polishing glasses . Rayburn reached out and poured himself another drink without looking at the bottle or the glass or Leo . He pushed a dollar bill across the bar in the general direction of the cash register . " Last drink , " he mumbled . Leo moved his bulk down behind the bar . " It 's all right , Rayburn . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . His eyes sparkled behind a misty alcohol veil . " I pays for what I drinks , " he said . " Sure , Rayburn , sure , " Leo said . He scooped the crumpled bill up in his hammy hand , went to the register , and rang up NO SALE . Rayburn , lost in his liquor , did not see that , and gathered up the dollar 's change Leo laid on the bar , dropping it into his pocket without looking at it . " Haw , haw , haw , " bellowed Big Betsy the whore , " didja hear that , Leo ? " " Nope , " said Leo . " He says he can fuck for free , but he 'll pay to talk . " " That 's crazy , " Leo said . " I 'll tell you what , " Big Betsy said to the young man , " you can talk all you want so long as you 're buyin ' drinks . " " Okay , " said the young man . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Big Betsy . " Gim me some gin , Leo . " " No more milk ? " said the young man . " Milk , " Big Betsy informed him , " is for babies . To shut up . " Leo poured the gin and refilled the shot glass with scotch . He took a dollar fifty from the change on the bar and went to the register to ring it up . On the way he noticed Rayburn 's vacated stool and paused briefly to remove the used glasses , recork the bottle , and wipe a few drops of moisture from the bar top with his side towel . " Haw , haw , haw , " laughed Big Betsy the whore from down the bar . " Haw , haw , haw , haw , haw . "  | The street lay empty in the wee-hours-of-the-morning darkness . There was a chill in the air , and Rayburn pulled his jacket close about him , shuddering , shaking in alcoholic tremens . He had trouble standing , so he hauled himself over to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head up and his vomit in . The light on the corner changed , but there was no rush of rubber-tired wheels ; there was no traffic . Just as the light was changing from yellow to red one lone car , a long pink Cadillac , careened through the intersection , raking its high beams across Rayburn 's slumping form , and vanished in a rush of wind and a blare of radioed soul music mingled with drunken voices . Rayburn watched it go , then he tottered into the alley and retched laboriously over some garbage cans . When he had vomited he felt better . He fumbled in his pocket and found change , pulled it out , counted it , unbelieving . There was a dollar there . A dollar . He considered going back in for another drink but shook his head , shoved the money back into his pocket , and struggled back out to the curb . His flat nose wrinkled at an unfamiliar stench , and his eyes darted around erratically until they focused on the body of the cat , lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vomit again , turned right , and began to walk . Every few steps his sense of direction would give out , and he would stagger into a wall and bounce away , half spinning from the impact . He mumbled loudly as he struggled along , conversing with the grimy walls , the light poles , the cars parked at infrequent intervals along the curb . " I ai n't too anxious to be goin ' home , " he informed a dented Ford , " ' cause you see , if I goes home , that bitch gon na give me a hard time for sure . I can hear it now . Rayburn , you done gone an ' spent up all the money an ' did n't give me nothin ' . ' As if to say she would n't a spent up all the money . Bitch . " He nodded for emphasis , stumbled on to a garbage can . " But , " he elaborated , " it 's possible , it is definitely possible , that the bitch ai n't gon na be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know , you know ? I do n't know . I do n't even know if I want the bitch to be there . I mean , it 's bad if she do be there , but it 's bad if she ai n't there , too , ' cause then I got ta wait for her to get back , an ' you know I think it all the time , maybe this time she ai n't gon na be comin ' back . Maybe she gone for good . Or maybe she done gone off with somebody an ' she 'll come tippin ' on in tomorrow with some shit about how she was out with that bitch sister a hers an ' she was too tired to come home . Lyin ' her damn head off . She knows I know she 's lyin ' . Knows I ai n't gon na call her on it , ' cause if I do she 's liable to go right on an ' tell me all about it . Then what the hell am I gon na do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ai n't tole me nothin ' I do n't got to be believin ' it , you know ? " The garbage can declined to reply . Rayburn launched an uncoordinated kick that did more harm to him than to the can , then hobbled , cursing , on down  | the street . Dark empty windows gazed at him blankly . Rayburn bounced off a wall , gyrated like a tightrope walker along the edge of the curb . " She 'll be back though , " he told the street . " Oh yeah , she be back , switchin ' her ass around like it was a goddamn flyswatter , wavin ' money in ma face . She say , " You ai n't got no money , baby ? Workin ' in that damn bank , place where they keeps that money , an ' you ai n't got none yourself ? What 's the matter with you ? You ai n't much of a man , that 's all I got to say . ' An ' then by Jesus I 'll take the bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Make her forget whoever that bastard was , make her forget his damn name . Fuck him right out of her . Make her climb the damn walls . I can do it too , by God . Only " ? Rayburn stopped and addressed the cluttered windows of a long-condemned junk shop ? " only you wonder , you know what I mean ? You got to be wonderin ' if she even knows who 's doin ' it to her . Maybe it do n't make no difference . Does it make a difference ? " Rayburn got no answer and , after a few minutes , forgetting the question , turned east once again and moved on , feet scuffing the cracked sidewalk , past the deserted SaIvation Army Mission Post , past the tobacco-juice-stained steps of tubercular rowhouses , his eyes glassed over and tired-looking . He shoved his hands into his pants pockets and held himself for a minute , then tottered into the next alleyway and urinated inaccurately , watching the clear stream splash on the cobblestones and spatter droplets back on his legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure diminished and the stream shortened and the urine dribbled onto his shoes . He zipped his pants and staggered out onto the street again , but now he had forgotten where he was going , so he just kept on walking , past the glittering facade of The Word of Life Church , with its fluorescent cross and flood-lit marquee assuring all and sundry that Jesus saved , past decaying houses and dilapidated stores , past the shadowy entrance beside one burned-out store that led to the apartment he called home . The light from the sign of the Elysium Hotel fell like a wide white bar across the street and the sidewalk in front of him ; he moved close to the walls , trying to avoid the harsh light , moving on to the corner , across the street . And then he looked up and stopped , seeing the spire of the bank building rising , shining , puncturing the night sky . He stared up at it , swaying back and forth , then looked down suddenly to see a bus standing in front of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , buddy , " shouted the driver . " I ai n't got all night . You gon na ride or you gon na piss in your pants ? " Rayburn stared a second longer , then climbed aboard totteringly , hanging onto the handrail like a tired old lady . " C'm on , for Chrissakes . Ai n't you got a quarter ? " Rayburn obediently fished out a quarter and dropped it into the fare box , fumbling for a minute as his erratic coordination made it difficult for him to get his hand over the  | slot . " Slices , " said the bus driver . " What the hell am I , crazy ? Runnin ' around here with nuttin ' but drunks . Take a scat , buddy , before you fall on your ass . Shees ! " Rayburn grasped one of the chromium stanchions and eased himself into a seat running lengthwise along the side of the bus . The light changed and the driver pulled away from the curb , working at the big steering wheel , grunting with effort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pouting child 's lower lip . " Shees , " he muttered , " shees . One friggin ' fare all friggin ' night . Crazy . " Rayburn stared out the window at the swiftly passing panorama of alleys and bars and darkened storefronts with dim lights glowing in the windows above them , all dingy from the years of smog and dirt and people . " I bet this joker 's soused , " muttered the driver . " Hey , buddy , you drunk ? " " Say what ? " said Rayburn . " You drunk ? If you 're drunk you got ta get offa here . Regulations . " " Nah , shit , " said Rayburn , " I ai n't drunk . " " Yeah ? " said the driver , peering suspiciously in his rearview mirror . " You sure ? " " Yeah , " said Rayburn . " I du n no , you look kinda beat . " " I ai n't drunk , muthafucka , " Rayburn snarled . " If you thought I was drunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I got ta let you on , " the driver said . " It 's the law . An ' if you 're drunk , I got ta kick you off . That 's the law too . " Rayburn looked at him . " Shit . " He went back to staring out the window . " All right , okay , buddy , take it easy , take it easy , I was just astin ' . Regulations . Hell , I do n't give a damn if a fella wants to get himself a little one tied on on Saturday night . Hell , I 'd be tyin ' one on myself if I was n't out tryin ' to pick up a little spare change , you know what I mean ? " Rayburn stared out the window . The driver stared in his mirror at the reflection of the side of Rayburn 's head . " I got this wife , see , " said the driver , waving one arm in the air and peeking in the mirror to see if Rayburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what I ever wanted to go an ' get married for . All she does is holler . I mean all the time . All the friggin ' time . A man works his fingers down to the knuckles an ' all he hears is , ' O'Brien , I need a new vacuum cleaner . ' Shees , I just bought her a new vacuum cleaner . Or , O'Brien , the kid needs new shoes . ' That kid must have fifteen pair a shoes already . You know what I mean ? " He peered into the mirror , but Rayburn 's eyes were on the passing street . " Yeah , " said the driver , " an ' then here I am , ridin ' around in the middle of the night . An ' you know what  | she 's doin ' ? She 's Navin ' Mrs. Casey in to look at TV . While I 'm out here bouncin ' bruises on my backside , she 's watchin ' TV an ' drinkin ' up my beer . do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear I do n't . I was bee and easy , I was , an ' then she comes along an ' gives me that , ' No , no , not until we 're married . ' Okay , I says , so I married her . Come to find out I Was n't even the first one . Can you beat that ? Hey , buddy , can you beat that ? " The driver stopped for a red light , turned in his seat to stare at Rayburn . " Shees . Saturday night . Nuttin ' but drunks what ca n't even carry On an intelligent conversation . Shees ! " He turned back and stamped on the accelerator in disgust . " Haw , haw , haw , " laughed Big Betsy the whore . " Hey , Leo , didja hear that ? " " Nope , " said Leo , looking up at her fat face from below the bar , where be was bent over , connecting a fresh keg to one of the taps . " I ast him who was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever see him before ? " " Ha , " said Leo , bending back to the keg . " You beats everything , you know it ? " said Big Betsy , slamming her fist into the young man 's shoulder and almost knocking him off the stool . " You beats hell outa everything . Hey , Leo , he 's buyin ' me another drink . Get off your knees an ' gim me another shot . " " Shut up a minute , willya , Betsy , " said Leo , without looking up . He grimaced as he felt for the connection . " Haw , haw , haw , " laughed Big Betsy . " Didja hear that ? " she said to the young man . She suddenly looked old and worn out and very ugly . " Leo , you black bastard , I wants a drink . You quit suckin ' yourself off down there an ' get me one . " Leo straightened up to his full six two and shoved out his jaw . " In a minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth when the young man reached over and laid his hand on her arm . " Take it easy . He 's getting it . " " Fuckin ' A , he 's gettin ' it , " grumbled Big Betsy . " He just better be gettin ' it . " She scowled fiercely . Leo looked at her with distaste . He bent down again and completed the connection , stood up , tested the tap , then poured her shot glass full , looked at her , glared at the young man . " Thanks , Leo , " said Big Betsy mildly . " Shit , " said Leo .  | " Hey , barkeep , " said a voice at the far end of the bar . Leo looked up , quickly concealing a frown . " What can I do for you , Leroy ? " " Mr. Briggs , " said a fat , dark-chocolate-skinned man . I le was wearing a bottle-green suit and a pink wide-collared shirt with a matching tie and highly polished black boots . His eyes were protected from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Betsy gave her companion a gentle nudge that could have broken ribs . " Niggers is all alike , " she said . " They think they 're big shit if they sits around all day like a white man an ' has folks linin ' up to kiss their ass , an ' at night they comes around , all dressed up like it was Halloween , to shit on all the other niggers . They do n't get to be mister until they done had a pint a gin . " " What you mumblin ' around about down there , piglady ? " said Leroy . " Nothin ' , " said Big Betsy sullenly . " Yeah , well , it better be nothin ' . " Big Betsy kept her mouth shut , but her cheeks puffed out and her eyes were fixed straight ahead . Leroy watched her for a minute . " Gim me a couple sixes , " he said to Leo out of the corner of his mouth . " Hey , Leroy , " somebody called out of the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Leroy shifted his glance into the darkness and smiled broadly , showing gold-filled teeth . " Oh , just a couple ladies wanted to do a little ridin ' , take in the evenin ' air , you know what I mean . " " Yeah , " mumbled Big Betsy , " so how come you do n't bring ' em in ? " Leroy glared at her . " I said they was ladies , not fat-assed old bar bait . " Leo set two six-packs of beer on the bar , one on top of the other , slipped a paper bag over the stack , grasped the bag at the bottom and flipped the whole thing over with a snap , rolled the top of the bag down , opened his mouth , and froze into immobility , unable to believe his ears . " What 's that mean ? " Betsy 's young man was saying , without looking up from his scotch . " They cost more'n two dollars ? " " Whad he say ? " whispered the wino . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , " said Leroy . " What have we here ? A funny man ? Ha , ha . Very funny , funny man . " " Glad you liked it . " " No , " Leroy said , " I did n't like it .

" " I have n't seen you , either , " said the young man . " Well , " said Leroy , " let me introduce maself . I 'm ? " " You 're Leroy Briggs , " the young man said . " Why , yes .

" The young man raised his eyes and looked at the bottles on the backbar . ' There might be some folks that would n't like that . " " There is , huh ? " said Leroy , unimpressed . " Yeah , " said the young man . He turned his head very slowly and stared Leroy straight in the eye . Leroy looked at him for a moment , and then his expression changed ever so slightly . " There is , huh ? " he repeated . The young man turned back and sipped at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding slightly . " You work for Gino ? " Leroy whispered hoarsely . " I do n't know any Gino , " the young man said , turning back to his glass . " You works for Gino , " said Leroy , with conviction . " If you say so . " " Well , you listen here . I do n't give a damn ' bout no Gino . I ai n't scared a no Gino . This here 's ma territory . " " Sure , " said the young man in a bored tone of voice . He looked at his nearly empty glass . " About dry here , Leo . " " You tell Gino , " said Leroy , shaking his finger , " or whoever you works for , you tell ' em I do n't give a shit ' bout no pasty-faced wops .

" Hey there , Mr. Briggs , " said the young man without looking up , " you forgot to pay for that beer . " Leroy whirled around . " That 's all right , " Leo said quickly , " it 's on the house . " But nobody was paying any attention to Leo . Leroy stared at the  | young man for a long time , then reached slowly into his pocket and pulled out a five-dollar bill and laid it on the bar . Leo looked back and forth between the two men , then he picked up the bill , took it to the register , rang up the sale , made change , and extended it toward Leroy . The young man looked at Leroy . " Keep the change , " he said softly . Leo stood confused , eyes wide . The cords stood out on Leroy 's neck , and he trembled slightly with anger . " Keep it , " the young man said : He smiled at Leroy . Leroy held his ground a moment longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo stared after him , stared at the change in his hand , shrugged , turned to the register , and rang up a sale in the amount . The cash drawer banged and the sound , like a signal , unstopped a flood of conversation , whispers , nervous laughter . " Haw , haw , haw , " bellowed Big Betsy the whore . " Didja hear that , Leo ? " " Naw , " said Leo , wiping sweat from his brow and eyeing the young man nervously . " Haw , haw , haw , " laughed Big Betsy . " I ast him who Gino was an ' he says he do n't know , he do n't even like hamburgers . Haw , haw , haw . " Leo stared at the young man for a long minute , the expression on his face a mixture of admiration , disbelief , and fear . He picked up a bottle of scotch , uncorked it , and poured the shot glass full , setting it and the uncorked bottle on the bar in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallet , but Leo waved a hand . " On the house , " he said . The young man looked at him , shook his head . " I pay . " Leo smiled . " It seems to me that Mr. Leroy Briggs done already paid for you , " he said , and walked away . Fifth Street : an uneven lane of cobblestones and trolley tracks that dated from sometime before the Civil War . There had been little traffic then , and there was no traffic now except for the dump trucks trundling away loads of rubble from the buildings being razed in an urban-redevelopment project . Rayburn walked along a weedy path that passed for a sidewalk , his shoes darkening as they absorbed moisture from the tall stalks of dandelion and Queen Anne 's Lace . Halfway down the block , on the nether edge of Society Hill  --  the point at which demolition had been halted  --  the side of a rowhouse clearly displayed the outlines of the rooms of the building that had once stood next to it . Now a giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remaining structure . Rayburn stared at the scene as he passed , thinking he saw a picture still hanging from the plaster 1 ? 7  | that clung desperately to the side of the building . Behind him , on the far side of the street , a door swung in the wind , banged loudly ; Rayburn spun too quickly , nearly falling . Beyond the hulks of houses was a pit where a high-rise apartment building would one day stand . Rayburn paused outside the white board fence that surrounded the site , peered down into the empty hole . He opened his pants and tried to urinate in order to watch the water fall , but nothing would come . He had just turned away from the fence when he saw the police car turn into the block , and he straightened quickly and tried to walk steadily as he moved farther north . Beside the walls of restored brick he told his troubles to stars made invisible by the glow of the city 's lights : We as good as dead , her an ' me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' she still keeps comin ' back . An ' it used to be so fine . But that was when it Started . Things is always good when they starts , an ' ends up shit . I 'd be Morin ' home from the bank an ' she 'd be settin ' up there waitin ' for me , prettied up an ' lookin ' fine . It was n't gon na last . They tole me that . They said , ' Rayburn , she 's just like the rest of ' em in that damn family . Every one of ' cm wild an ' crazy . ' Well , hell , I was n't gon na be listenin ' to that shit . It was good for a while , an ' maybe sometime it 's gon na be good again . Sure it will be . I 'll get things for her some damn way , an ' she 'll be happy . Only , she useta be happy with just me home from work ; two in the mornin ' an ' us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream an ' listenin ' to that little transistor radio , maybe drinkin ' a little beer . An ' she 'd come over an ' set up on ma lap just like she was a little girl , an ' I 'd hug her an ' pull her hair an ' tease her an ' love her up . If she frowned even , all I ever had to do was say , ' Hey now , baby , ' an ' she 'd cut it right out . They all tole me , they said , ' She 's just like the rest of ' em , just like her sister , sleepin ' in fifty-cent ho-tels an ' screwin ' anything that moves . ' I tried to tell ' em she wouldn'ta been doin ' none a that , ' cept she was hungry . Lord knows , nobody ought a have to pay for what they done when they was hungry . An ' she was n't nothin ' but seventeen . But they was n't gon na listen to me . Well , they was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' her belly full an ' some clothes on her back . It had to be new . She say , ' Rayburn , I wants a new dress . ' But I did n't have no money for a dress like she wanted , an ' I told her so . Only then I come in an ' seen it hangin ' there . . . . " Rayburn stumbled in a pothole , fell heavily against the side of a building , pushed himself away from it , staggered on . " WATCHITYOUSTUPIDASSHOLE ! ! " yelled the taxi driver as his speeding cab missed Rayburn by inches . Market Street , six lanes wide and lit up like day , lay before him like a moat , sequestering another world : Independence Mall , stores , restaurants , offices . Rayburn stepped back on  | the curb , realizing in a flash of lucidity that he would have to be careful here . He straightened up and realized also that he was almost sober now , almost sober and feeling tired . It was late . The air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the day before . He turned left and walked west , the jars as his feet struck the even pavement shaking his bones painfully . His bladder was full , but the street was far too bright for him to do anything about it . Pissing in the middle of South Street was a misdemeanor , pissing in the middle of Market Street was a major crime . The plate-glass department store windows , full of clothes and appliances and half-dressed dummies , reflected his image . It was morning now ; outside Gimbels a vendor hawked the Sunday papers . Rayburn shoved his hands deep into his jacket pockets , felt the lining of the left pocket tear a little with a tiny rasping sound . Suddenly he knew where he was going , and his feet moved more quickly . He jingled the change in his right pocket as he walked  --  seventy-five cents . He moved through the archway into the courtyard of City Hall and out the other side , feeling a strange urgency . The bank was at Sixteenth Street , but he stopped before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the east side of Sixteenth where many of the bank 's lesser daytime employees ate lunch . The place was still open ; Rayburn could see the waitress lounging behind the counter , looking bored . He put his hand on the door , pushed it open , went in . The waitress looked up unhappily . " We 're closin ' in fifteen minutes , " she said . Rayburn ignored her and took a seat at the counter . She shrugged , picked up a damp side towel , wiped the Formica in front of him . " What 'll it be ? " she said resignedly . " A hamburger , " Rayburn said . " Ai n't got no hamburgers . " " What you mean ? It 's right there on the sign . " " That 's for daytime . We ai n't gon na keep the grill warmed up this time of night . " " Well , what do you got ? " " Pie , donuts , toast  --  stuff like that . " " I 'll have a piece a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie . " " I guess I 'll have to have me a piece a somethin ' else . " The waitress looked at him uneasily . " What kind a pie do you got ? " Rayburn said . " Onliest kind we ever got is cherry an ' apple , an ' we 're outa cherry . " Rayburn gave her an amused look . She flushed . " Apple pie an ' some coffee , " Rayburn said .  | " Black ? " asked the waitress , writing it on her pad before he had a chance to answer . " No , " Rayburn snarled , " I wants it light . An ' sweet . " He glared at her , but she was n't looking at him . Wordlessly , she crossed out " blk " and wrote in " C &S."; " We 're closin ' in ten minutes , " she said . " Yeah , " Rayburn said sourly , " so I heard . " She looked at him , shrugged her shoulders , and went to get the pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rayburn watched her waddle away , thinking how bad she looked . Part of it was the uniform , but she was fat and greasy-looking anyway . Rayburn kited her . She came waddling back and slapped an almost-clean plate with a painfully thin sliver of pie on it in front of him . She laid a paper napkin beside the plate , held it down with a spoon and a fork that had obviously been used for someone 's eggs . " You want that coffee black ? " " What the hell didja write it down for ? " The waitress frowned and started digging through her pocket for the order pad . Rayburn waited until her fingers closed over it and then said , " I wants cream an ' sugar . " The waitress let the pad fall back into her pocket and gave Rayburn a look of pure hatred . " Look , " she said , " I did n't ast to work on Saturday night . " " I was n't the one made you , " Rayburn said indifferently . " Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? " " I ca n't hurry nothin ' till I gets ma coffee . " " Oh , " she said nervously , " yeah . " She turned to the urn and drew him a cup , poured in cream , set the cracked china in front of him with a tall sugar dispenser . Rayburn finished cleaning the fork with his napkin . The girl looked at him . " You , ah , gon na want more coffee ? If you 're not , I can start cleaning the urn . " " Go ahead , " Rayburn said . She flashed him a yellow-toothed smile and opened the spigot , letting the muddy-brown liquid dribble into the drain . " You got the last piece a pie , " she said , looking over her shoulder . " Tastes like it , " Rayburn said . " You work here in the daytime ? " " I got a boyfriend , " the girl said . " He 's probably waiting outside . " " What the hell do I care ? " Rayburn said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daytime . " " No , " she said , " just at night on the weekends . " " Night on the weekends , " Rayburn repeated . " Figures . " He finished up the last of the pie , picked up the coffee cup , blew over the edge . " My boyfriend , he plays football and wrestles . He knows judo and  | karate , too . They threw him outa school for bruin ' somebody up real bad oncet . " " How come he do n't wait for you inside ? Ai n't he house-broke ? " The girl looked at him . Rayburn smiled and leaned back . She turned her face away , blushing . " You about finished ? " " ' Bout , " Rayburn said . " I 'm tryin ' to decide if maybe I better not stick around to see your boyfriend . " The girl kept her head turned away . Rayburn drank the rest of his coffee . It was cold now , and it tasted like dishwater . He drank it down defiantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dregs . He wiped his lips with the paper napkin . " How ' bout the check ? " She stood as far away from him as she could , on the far side of the counter , back pressed tightly against the coffee urn , and kept one eye on him as she laboriously added the bill , found the tax on a printed table scotch-taped to the back of the order pad , wrote down the total , circled it . " Thirty-seven cents , " she said . Rayburn pulled out two quarters , held them out in the palm of his hand . She waited for a moment , then realized that he was not going to lay them down on the counter , that she was going to have to take them from his hand . She looked at him . Rayburn smiled . Slowly she extended her hand until it hung trembling over his , then her fingers darted like a drunken hawk and snatched the coins away . She went quickly to the register to make change . Rayburn followed her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We ai n't got much cash this time of night , " she said . " What 's the matter ? " said Rayburn . " Ai n't you got change for a quarter ? " The girl glared at him , punched a button , and , as the cash drawer sprang out , snatched at the money , finding the dime easily but fumbling for an instant for the three pennies , whirling awkwardly and slamming the drawer shut with her hip . " I got ta close up now , " she said . " Ai n't nothin ' to me , " said Rayburn . He held his hand out . The girl dropped the change into it from high altitude . Rayburn turned toward the door . " I sure hope your boyfriend can get his judo workin ' on some a them nasty folks out there in the street . Why , while we was in here safe together he coulda got killed three times , deadern hell . " He smiled at her acidly . " Here , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piggy bank . " Rayburn walked across the street to the bank , stood by the concrete pillars , staring through the broad plate-glass windows at the carpeted floors and the tellers ' stations and the leather chairs for people to sit in while they  | waited for assistant managers to discuss loans for cars and homes and color TV sets . Rayburn thought about the money inside , behind the doors , behind the heavy cover of the vault . He would have liked to have seen it , to tee what all that money looked like . Just once . Rayburn stepped back , out tt'om under the pillar-supported overhang , looked up at the building , at the glass windows mounting higher , growing smaller , stretching his neck until could see the executive suites at the top . Rayburn 's job was to clean those suites , and he often stood in the carpeted , wood-paneled , leatherupholstered chambers and looked out over the city . Looking down through the dark and the smog , he could sometimes make out the row of dim lights that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the tall spire was beginning to hurt his neck . He was tired . It was late . He wanted to go home . Ile turned toward the corner , feeling his pocket for the dime and the three nickels . He did not want to walk , although it was not far . He stood on e corner , tapping the sidewalk with the toe of his shoe , staring down into the gutter . He looked up and peered down the street . He felt an insistent tugging at his sleeve , turned to see a fat old woman with a dark moon face looking up at him . Her skin had a strange cast in the light spilling through the windows of the bank . " Wo n't you give to the Indian children ? " she said , holding up a tin can covered with paper and shaking it in front of his nose . Coins rattled flatly . " No , " Rayburn said . " Please , sir , they need your help so much . They 're hungry . Some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ? " " Go to hell , " Rayburn said . " Please , " said the woman , catching hold of his arm . " Have you no children ? Can you imagine what it means to be a child , hungry and alone ? " Rayburn whirled around and threw his change against the bank 's glass windows , where it struck with a ringing sound of metal on glass and fell tinkling to the pavement . " Pick it up ! " he shouted . " You wants it so goddamn bad , you pick it up ! " He shoved the woman away from him and stalked away . It was closing time at Lightnin ' Ed 's . " Buy it now , " yelled Leo , " bar 's closin ' down . " " Aw , shit , " muttered Big Betsy.  | " Wharf he say ? " asked the deaf wino . " He says you got ta get the hell outa here , " Big Betsy told him . " Like hell I do , " said the wino . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Big Betsy to the young man . " Leo 's tries to let on like he 's tough , but Jake 's been sleepin ' in that back room every Saturday night for the last fifteen years . Leo 's got a soft heart behind his soft gut . Ai n't that right , Leo ? " " Shut up , Betsy , " said Leo amiably . " Hey , Leo , " said a small voice . Leo turned . " I thought I told you to clear outa here , Elmo . Now what the hell you want ? " " Just one more little drinkee , " said Elmo , squinting up into Leo 's face and grinning . " All right , " Leo sighed . " One more beer an ' then you get your ass outa here . An ' you better hope you do n't run into Rayburn . " " Rayburn , shit ! " spat Elmo , reaching a hand out hungrily for the beer . Leo took his money as though it were not quite clean . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigger would just as soon slice your balls off as look at you . Ca n't say I blame him . Only I 'd aim for your throat . Your balls is too small a target . " " That nigger 's crazy , " Elmo said , slurping the head off his beer . " He 's awful fast to start slicin ' on folks that 's doin ' the talkin ' , but he ai n't so quick to be slicin ' at the ones that 's doin ' all the doin ' . " Elmo slammed the half-full beer glass down on the bar for emphasis . " Maybe he would be if he knowed who they was , " Leo said . " Maybe he would n't be , seein ' as it 's Leroy Briggs , " said Elmo triumphantly . " Leroy ? " said Leo softly . " Yeah , sure , it 's Leroy . That bitch is always hangin ' around the Elysium , gettin ' Leroy to take her for rides an ' shit . " " You ' bout finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma bar , right now . " Elmo scowled , gulped the rest of the beer , and shuffled toward the door . " And Elmo , " Leo called after him . " What ? " " You open your stinkin ' mouth to Rayburn , an ' I swear to Jesus I 'll cut your throat maself . " Elmo smiled , but the smile faded as he realized that Leo meant exactly what he said . He turned and almost ran through the door .  | " Haw , haw , haw , " roared Big Betsy the whore , heading for the door , " dula hear what he said ? " " Naw , " said Leo . " Said I reminded him of his mother . Haw , haw , haw . G'night Leo . Haw , baw , haw , haw , haw . " Leo turned to the young man . " Yeah , well . Lemme tell you somethin ' . You 'd best not be playin ' with Leroy Briggs . I do n't know what kinda friends you got , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful a Leroy . He 's got lotsa friends , too . Even folks that hates his guts has to kiss his ass , if you know What I mean . " The young man looked at Leo . " I know what you mean , " he said . He 10t up and vanished through the door . When the bar was empty , Leo made sure the old wino was bedded down comfortably in the back room . Then he opened the cash register and pocketed the money without bothering to count it and slipped his revolver into his jacket pocket . He took out a bottle of cheap red wine and put it up on the bar where the wino could find it easily . He turned out the last of the lights and stepped out into the darkness . He locked the door and turned to sec the young man standing a few feet away . " What you want ? " said Leo , using his hand toward his revolver . " To ask you a question . " " What ? " said Leo suspiciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crazy ? " " Kinda , " said the young man , and smiled . " Shit , " said Leo , fighting the urge to smile himself . He kept his face serious , but his hand moved away from the gun . " You listen here . . . whad you say your name was ? " " Brown . " Leo looked skeptical , shrugged . " Well , you listen , Brown . Do n't you forget what I said about Leroy . He 's a mean bastard , an ' he do n't forget . Now which way you headin ' ? " " West . " " Well , I 'm goin ' the other way , so I 'll be seein ' you . " Brown stood and watched Leo move off down the street . He smiled to himself and stepped into the alley and relieved the pressure in his bladder . Ile came out onto the street again , wrinkling his nose at the stench of a dead cat lying in the gutter . He moved away . His feet made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty-ninth Street , the river , and the bridge to the other side .  | A slow-moving shadow sliding south along the sides of concrete towers . Nineteenth Street , one way south , lined with tiny shops : a violin dealer and a deli here , a children 's boutique and a tiny , mob-monied cafe there . Outside the Rittenhouse Plaza , standing on the awning-covered , weatherstained carpet , the doorman watches without suspicion as the thin figure moves along , feet shuffling from fatigue and alcohol . The doorman shoves his hands into his uniform pockets and whistles tunelessly . Walnut Street and then the Square , where in the daylight children play and bony spinsters walk marcelled dogs , where when night falls the part-time hippies swarm  --  female typists and high-school girls decked out in store-bought poor-boy clothes and pretattered bell-bottom blue jeans , sitting on the walls and waiting for real life to wander over and proposition them ; and the boys : white boys with guitars and joints and jugs of warm cheap wine , black boys costumed in knitted shirts and beads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rap to , jive a little , scare a little , excitate and titillate , and maybe hold her hand . Past the apartment houses where the D.A . lives , shadow floating down the street , past townhouses and the pizza joint where the cop cars congregate like sinners at a revival meeting , past the hospital that ministers to God-knows-who , finally to South Street , silent and dark , with even the rats asleep , the street people gone to wherever street people go when the street itself finally sleeps . Up the steps , rotten wood , spattered with paint from when someone poured his passion on the wall with great scrawling letters in obscene red ; finally to his door , standing before it , key in hand , hand trembling , knowing now that he wanted her there , needed her to be there , frightened that she would not be there and would never be there again ; pushing through the door and shutting it behind him , slipping through the littered living room to the bedroom , keeping his eyes turned away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully laying his keys on the dresser before turning his head and opening his eyes and seeing her form lying there in the broken-down bed beneath the threadbare blanket . Slipping his clothes off , letting them drop in an untidy pile on the splintering floor , the forgotten pennies fall and roll and rattle on unfinished wood , and then beside her , breathing deep , placing his hand gingerly on her side , feeling the bulge of a little fat , recalling when her body was all bone-hard and her ribs showed plainly through her skin , feeling her responding to his touch , and kissing her ; running his tongue inside her  | mouth , beneath her tongue , along her teeth , feeling her body warm and moist and open ; and hearing , just as he goes to her , her sleep-husky voice in his ear , " Give it to me , baby , oh , yes , give it to me again , " and knowing , when almost beyond the point of knowing anything , or of caring , that she was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
