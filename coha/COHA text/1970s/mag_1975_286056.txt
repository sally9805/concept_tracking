The following Bicentennial Essay is the second in a series that will appear periodically into early 1976 and will examine how we have grown in our 200 years . <P> The executive staff of the first President of the U.S. rarely consisted of more than two men . When George Washington did not have the heart to keep his secretaries from going on vacation , he penned all the presidential correspondence himself . President Ford 's executive staff totals 535 . <P> Washington had no need of organizational charts or doorkeepers to prevent his staff from interfering with each other and becoming an irritation to him . Ford , wishing to replace Nixon 's sealed chamber with an " open presidency , " announced that nine designated advisers would have direct access to him at all times . But this attempt at simplification did not work out in practice ; there were still too many people clamoring to see him , too many interruptions , too many demands on his time . The President still needs a kind of traffic cop , and Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Although the men who drafted the Constitution were familiar with the tyranny of kings , they gave the President great power , largely because they tailored the office to fit the man who they knew would be the first incumbent . Trusting George Washington , they made him - and all his successors - Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces , ruled that he could be removed from office only for treason or criminal behavior , and gave him veto power over the Legislative Branch . Since then , other Presidents have increased this inherently powerful office in size , panoply and functions , but not in effectiveness , public confidence or contact with the people . <P> In setting up his own staff when he became President , Jefferson described with admiration how Washington had handled official correspondence . Each Cabinet minister received all letters relevant to his department . Should he decide that a letter required no reply , he would nonetheless communicate it to Washington " for his information . " Other letters were sent to the President with the proposed reply attached . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If any doubt arose , he brought it up at a conference , " Jefferson commented . " By this means he was always in accurate possession of all facts and proceedings in every part of the Union ... and met himself the due responsibility for whatever was done . " <P> Letters now come into the Executive by the millions . There are eleven Cabinet posts to Washington 's four . Ford , like Nixon , has avoided Cabinet Secretaries who possess any political clout of their own that would give them substantial independence ( the exception is Kissinger ) . Washington 's chief Cabinet members were the nation 's two outstanding leaders after Washington himself : Jefferson and Hamilton . As long as they stayed in office , Washington kept them under control . Under Washington , the personnel of the total Federal Government was 350 . In March 1975 the number of employees in the Executive Branch alone totaled 2,815,670 . <P>
