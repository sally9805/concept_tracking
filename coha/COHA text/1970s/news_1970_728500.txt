txt The Monitor 's recent series ? " The Consumer Fights Back " ? has prompted dozens of readers to second the experiences ' cited and to suggest ways in which both business and consumers can sharpen their marketplace performance . On the food front , for instance , Mrs. Marie Barnes of Trenton , Mo. , advises shoppers to shake cans of vegetables and fruits as one primitive but fairly effective way of determining their water content . She adds that when she complained to her local supermarket manager about the quantity of water and quality of fish in a brand of canned mackerel , the lot was removed from the shelves and soon replaced with improved stock . Mrs. Grace Herron of Avon Lake , Ohio , encloses the red label from a can of beef stew , reporting that it did contain beef ? exactly three small pieces . She asks rhetorically why , when she can still get chuck roast for 69 cents a pound , the manufacturer can not afford to include a few more pieces for a can of stew that costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they get the most for their money by watching grocery scales when meat , vegetables , and fruit are being weighed , stresses Arthur Israel , a Chicago lawyer who has worked as a food chemist and in government enforcement of food control laws . Credit cards rejected Reporting that he has found discrepancies as glaring as one pound on a three and a half pound chicken , he notes that sometimes scales placed high above the customer in meat departments tempt butchers to read the weight as higher than it actually is . Food perishables should be labeled for use by certain dates in the same way that film is now tagged , argues Mrs. Charles A. Greene of Kccne , N.H. She makes her case with a certain fervor since she has twice baked cakes ( using newly purchased baking soda and baking powder ) which fell . Her oven was recently checked so it deserves none of the blame , she says . Some readers work hard to get response to their problems directly from the businesses concerned . Their success varies . Mrs. Lyman Bliss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered but pressed " credit cards on its customers . She made her views known by refusing to accept her card and by sending bank officials a marked copy of the Monitor 's series piece on credit problems . When Mrs. Alvina Birkemeyer of Salem , Ore. , pulled into a service station for gas , she soon saw steam mysteriously pouring forth from under the open hood . The attendant informed her that the generator was " generating so fast it will burn up the battery . " Like an Arizona student cited in the Monitor article on auto repairs , she was told it could only be repaired on the spot . // *Consumers tell tales of woe dOntinued from Page 1 But when all was said and done , the needed replacement part could not be found . She wrote an irate letter to the service station 's Oklahoma headquarters and reports a satisfactory answer . Whether the station has stopped taking advantage of motorists , howeVer , is something else again . Payment withheld Withholding money until satisfaction is assured is a technique that works for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ore. , has been waiting in vain since last June for the replacement for her poorly made kitchen curtains to arrive . When the first set was unwrapped , she decided to hold off paying the bill until she had a good replacement in hand . ? A helpless shrug from the store owner and a , " we must see it to believe it " note from the manufacturer was the only satisfaction received by Mrs. Vickie Jaworsky of Silver Sp-ring , Md. , when she complained that a friend 's new navy blue skiing parka almost went up in flames on the spot as the wearer stood five feet from a ski lodge fireplace . The acrylic material crumpled and smoked . The manufacturer , on hearing of the incident , replied by ' enclosing a warning label about the material 's flammable qualities but Mrs. Jaworsky argues it should have been attached to the parka at the poirit of purchase . One tactic , of course , is to patronize the cOrhpetition . Disappointed with the inconvenient service hours in which to get her $12:95 percolator repaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand Made in Wisconsin . If any trouble comes ( and it has n't ) , the manufacturer has agreed to pay the cost of parts and return mailing from the factory . Guarantee questioned Acts that promise more than they can deliver are a major concern of many readers . Stanley Warner of Forest Park , Ill. , enclosing an act for a watch with a " Lifetime guarantee , " asks , " If it goes bad after 15 months , what 's to prevent the seller from saying its ' life ' . was only 12 months ? " Then there are the telephone company ads which show a kitchen phone attached to a brick wall on one side of a built-in oven and another on the side of a kitchen furniture unit . When Mrs. Constance McCarthy of New Canaan , Conn. saw this ad she started thinking about all kinds of installment possibilities as she moved into her new home . But once the installation man arrived ( after a two-month wait ) , she was assured the only place he could put her kitchen phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back door . " I have moved enough to know that despite what the company says , you get your telephone set where the serviceman says he can put it , and you get the color you want if they happen to have it , " laments Mrs. McCarthy . Where to write In response to a request from G. Stallings of Shaker Heights , Ohio , here are a few useful addresses for consumer notebooks : The National Commission on Product Safety , which concerns itself with just what its name implies , is located at 1016 16th Street N.W. , Washington , 20036 .
