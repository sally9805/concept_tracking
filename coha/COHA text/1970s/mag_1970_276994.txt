The First and Real Americans <P> Sir : The American Indian Feb. 9 is truly one of the most tragic figures in American history , having been enslaved , starved , robbed of his land and finally shoved into a dark corner by his " white masters . " It is ironic that he is treated as a foreigner by people who are less American than he . Thousands of Indians live and die without ever knowing what the phrase " life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness " really means . <P> CHRISTOPHER MEHNE Valhalla , N.Y . <P> Sir : To have tamed and broken the bold spirit of these magnificent people , while molding them into submissiyeness , bears resemblance to the sin of taming all wild stallions to pull a plow and letting the eagle become extinct . <P> ( MRS . ) CAROL ELFERS Norwalk , Ohio <P> Sir : As a resident of Wyoming , constantly derided for my " cowboy and Indian " heritage , I can assure you that your maudlin expose on the American Indian will serve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity piece along American highways . <P> STEVE RODERMEL New Haven , Conn . <P> Sir : In an otherwise thoughtful article , you mentioned Senator Edward Kennedy 's concern for Indians but omitted any reference to the contribution to Indians made by Arizona 's Senators Paul Fannin and Barry Gpldwater and by Representative Sam Steiger . American Indians do not . ne.e4 .. more , concern ; they need more help . We Arizonans are proud of the important contribution American Indians have made and are making to our state and nation . And we are likewise proud of the effects of our congressional delegation in helping them gain equal opportunity . Please remind your writers , and perhaps Senator Kennedy , that the age of rhetoric is over ; the time for action is at hand . <P> CHARLES R. MCDOWELL Phoenix , Ariz . <P> Sir : Perhaps the American Indian has some right to be indignant at being misnamed by " some dumb honky who got lost , " to use the words of a Berkeley student whom TIME ironically refers to as a " Sioux " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . But then , so would the Innuit , who were misnamed " Eskimo " by their traditional enemy , the " Indians . " No racial insult was intended in the first misnaming-I 'm sure plenty was intended in the second ! And by the way , the artist whose photo you show is probably no more an Indian than is his pottery tableau of three Eskimos wearing Inland Caribou dress and whimsically seated on the edge of an oversize Eskimo cooking lamp . My educated guess is that the artist is Tegumiak of Rankin Inlet , Northwest Territory , Canada . As a part Abenaki , I think we can afford to give our fellow " Americans " credit where credit is due , and the position of the Eskimo in the modern art world is creditable . <P> PHILIP H. GRAY Bozeman , Mont . <P> Sir : I was an " inmate " of one of the BIA schools . The school offered no courses in math higher than arithmetic , no languages , no electives , and only elementary science classes . What we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town and an insidious way of robbing us of our dignity by the staff , both Indian and white .
