THE HOSPITAL . DAY . MAY , 1971 PANORAMIC VIEW of The Hospital  --  a vast medical complex , a sprawling pastiche of architecture extending ten blocks north and south on First Avenue and east to the river . The Hospital was founded in the late 19th century , and there are still a few begrimed Victorian Bedlams and Bastilles among the buildings . Mostly though , it is Medical Modern 1971 , white and chrome and lots of glass and concrete shafts and rotundas . A spanking new Community Mental Health Clinic towers among the tenements at the northern end of the complex . On the far side of First Avenue , a twenty-story apartment house with recessed balconies and picture windows to house the resident staff has just recently been completed , and next to it , eight ghetto buildings are being demolished to make way  --  according to the construction company 's sign  --  for a new Drug Rehabilitation Center , to be completed in 1973 , we should all live so long . This is where the shattering SOUNDS OF CONSTRUCTION are coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines are POUNDING , CRASHING , SCREAMING . Traffic HONKS and BRAYS up First Avenue . It is a cold spring morning  --  10:00 A.M. A 1966 station wagon pulls up to the Holly Pavilion . A tiny , fragile , white-bearded OLD MAN , almost lost in his overcoat , is helped from the rear of a station wagon and slowly led to the entrance doors by a middle-aged nurse . &nbsp; NARRATOROn Monday morning , a patient named Guernsey , male , middle-seventies was admitted to the hospital complaining of chest pains . HOLLY PAVILION . EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR The old man is now in a wheelchair pushed by a hospital orderly down the corridor .  --  3  --  &nbsp; NARRATORHe had been referred by a nursing home where the doctor had diagnosed his condition as angina pectoris . Now it is axiomatic that nursing home doctors are always wrong . ROOM 806 The old man , shirtless , is propped on the edge of the bed , wheezing . DR . SCHAEFER , a young intern in white-uniform , perches beside him with the old man 's chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other patient in the two-bedded room , a MIDDLE-AGED MAN , is comatose and all rigged up with I.V . ' s and catheters . &nbsp; NARRATORThe intern who admitted Mr. Guernsey , however , accepted the diagnosis and prescribed morphine , a drug suitable for angina but not at all suitable for emphysema , which is , unfortunately , what the old man actually had . Within an hour . . . EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR Two orderlies rush the old man 's bed with , of course , the old man in it , past the Nurses ' Station and into a waiting elevator . &nbsp; NARRATOR . . . the patient became unresponsive and diaphoretic and was raced up to Intensive Care with an irregular pulse of 150 , blood pressure 90 over 60 , respiration rapid and shallow . INTENSIVE CARE An oxygen mask is applied to the old man 's face by the resident . &nbsp; NARRATORThe resident on duty now compounded the blunder by treating the old man for pulmonary edema . He gave him digitalis , diuretics and oxygen . This restored the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door opens . Two orderlies wheel the sleeping man on his bed back around the Nurses ' Station and down the corridor to his room .  --  4  --  &nbsp; NARRATOR . . . and he was sent back to his room in the Holly Pavilion , ruddy complected and peacefully asleep . ROOM 806 . EVENING The old man is back in his room sleeping serenely , his tiny body making barely a ripple in the white sheet that covers him . The room is in hushed shadows . A yellowish light diffuses into the room from the half-opened bathroom door . The other patient in the room remains as before , comatose and silent . &nbsp; NARRATORIn point of fact , the patient was in CO2 narcosis . . . ROOM 806 All the lights are on now . NURSE PENNY CANDUSO and an orderly are wrapping the old man in a post-mortem shroud . BRUBAKER , the senior resident , is giving hell to Schaefer , the intern . &nbsp; NARRATOR . . . and died at seven-thirty that evening . The shrouded body of the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vacated bed . &nbsp; NARRATORI mention all this , only to explain how the bed in Room 806 became available . PAN from bed to Schaefer , now alone in the room and regarding the empty bed with frowning interest . Schaefer is a scraggly young fellow , bespectacled , with a contemporary mess of hair and a swinging unkempt moustachio . HOLD on Schaefer . &nbsp; NARRATORThe intern involved was a prickly young buck named Schaefer who had a good thing going for him with a technician in the hematology lab . In the haphazard fashion of hospital romances , Dr. Schaefer had been zapping this girl on wheelchairs , stretchers , pantry shelves . . . Dr. Schaefer moves for the phone on the table between the two beds.  --  5  --  &nbsp; NARRATOR . . . in the kitchen , in the morgue , in the dark corners of corridors . . . Schaefer speaks softly into the phone . &nbsp; NARRATOR . . . standing up , sitting down  --  so you can imagine what an available bed meant to him . &nbsp; SCHAEFER ( on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheila . Hey listen . I got us a bed for tonight . A real , honest-to-god bed . FREEZE on CLOSE-UP of the beaming , lubricious Schaefer on phone as CREDITS AND MUSIC ERUPT ONTO THE SCREEN  --  THE HOSPITAL INTERSPERSED WITH CREDITS , the following scenes : ROOM 806 . NIGHT Dark . Just a bit of moonlight streaking through the not quite closed bathroom . The hallway door opens , and a young woman , carrying a top coat , slips quickly in giggling like hell , followed by Schaefer , who is likewise giggling and admonishing her to be quiet . Her name is SHEILA . Sheila notices the other patient in the room sleeping away and looks questioningly at Schaefer , who reassures her as he removes her coat . After which he strips off his own white jacket and trousers and hangs them in the armoire . The girl asks in a hoarse whisper if they 're going to get totally nude and wonders if that 's such a good idea . For an answer , Schaefer fondles her crotch . They both giggle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're both stoned . The girl unzippers her dress . The dark room is filled for the moment with the flurry of undressing , flung garments , elbows , legs and arms , bumpings into each other , and Sheila saying between giggles , " Boy , I sure hope nobody walks in . " They eventually wind up on the unoccupied bed , and the scene ends looking ACROSS the sleeping profile of THE PATIENT in the other bed as Schaefer  --  6  --  and his girl thump away at each other with much creaking of springs , moans , groans , giggles and the white-limbed patterns of fornication . ROOM 806 Dark , silent , hushed . The fun and games are over . Sheila is in front of the armoire . She slips back into her dress , after which she tiptoes back to the bed where Schaefer is deeply asleep , smiling in postcoital peace . Sheila bends , shakes his shoulder . &nbsp; SHEILA ( whispers ) I 'll see you . Schaefer smiles , grunts , sleeps on . END OF CREDITS . FADE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6:30 A.M. NEXT MORNING , TUESDAY A cold newly-dawned sun shines down on the vast sprawling complex of the hospital . Desultory early morning traffic on First Avenue . HOLLY PAVILION , EIGHTH FLOOR The night shift of nurses is closing out another night 's work , which has been on the whole uneventful . The head nurse , MRS . REARDON , hunches over her paperwork . NURSE ELIZABETH RIVERS sits at the desk beside her , resting her head on the palm of one hand . NURSE 'S AID J.C . MILLER crosses with an armful of linens . She disappears into the pharmacy and supply areas behind the Nurses ' Station . In the west corridor , NURSE LUCINDA PEREZ glances at her watch , then pads down to Room 806 . She enters . ROOM 806 . DAY A cold gray light cheerlessly illuminates the room . Nurse Perez checks the I.V . on the comatose patient who is in the bed nearest the door . Then she turns to regard the other bed  --  which gives her pause .  --  7  --  NURSE 'S P.O.V. : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyes dilated , pupils staring unseeing . An I.V . tube sticks out of his naked right arm . Nurse Perez does n't quite know what to make of the fact that Dr. Schaefer is lying on that bed with an I.V . tube sticking out of him looking dead . Frowning , she reaches out a tentative hand to shake his naked shoulder . &nbsp; NURSE PEREZDoctor Schaefer . . . . There is , of course , no response . A terrible suspicion enters Nurse Perez 's mind , and she closes her eyes and sighs a long shuddering sigh . Then she opens her eyes and , with a second and briefer sigh , reaches for Schaefer 's neck to take his pulse . Clearly , the result is not encouraging . She sighs another short sigh and regards Schaefer 's unblinking , dilated pupils . It 's all a bit too much for her ; she shuffles to the window and stares out into the gray morning where things are a little more comprehensible . Once again , she returns to the bed , regards Schaefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one short but appreciative moment , considers Schaefer 's naked body . She lets the bedsheet carefully down . She sighs again . &nbsp; NURSE PEREZ ( trying again , with little hope ) Doctor Schaefer ? She sighs , turns and leaves the room . EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR Nurse Perez , frowning and pursing her lips , moves slowly back to . . . EIGHTH FLOOR , NURSES ' STATION Head Nurse Reardon is still bent over her paperwork . &nbsp; NURSE PEREZListen , did you know Doctor Schaefer was in Eight-O-Six , because he 's dead ? &nbsp; MRS . REARDON ( late forties , continues her painstaking paperwork , grunts ) What ? &nbsp; NURSE PEREZI 'm just telling you , Dr. Schaefer is dead .  --  8  --  &nbsp; MRS . REARDON ( works on ; after a moment , looks up ) What do you want , Perez ? &nbsp; NURSE PEREZLook , I do n't know what the hell this is all about , but Dr. Schaefer is in Room 806 with an I.V . running and he 's dead . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( regards Perez a moment ) Perez , what the hell are you talking about ? ( appeals to Nurse Rivers coming out of the floor pharmacy ) Do you know what the hell she 's talking about ? &nbsp; NURSE PEREZWell , maybe I 'm going crazy . I do n't know . Is n't Room 806 the patient Guernsey ? I mean , did something happen I do n't know about ? &nbsp; MRS . REARDONPerez , I do n't know what you 're talking about . &nbsp; NURSE PEREZThis is the nuttiest thing I ever saw . Dr. Schaefer 's in Room 806 dead . &nbsp; MRS . REARDONWhat Dr. Schaefer ? Our Dr. Schaefer ? &nbsp; NURSE PEREZOur Dr. Schaefer . The one who 's always grabbing everybody 's ass . &nbsp; MRS . REARDON ( to Nurse Rivers ) Do you know what she 's talking about ? I do n't know what she 's talking about . ( to Perez ) What do you mean Doctor Schaefer 's in Room 806 dead ? &nbsp; NURSE PEREZI mean , he 's lying on the far bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking out of him . And if you do n't believe me , maybe you just ought to get up and look for yourself . With a short , irritable sigh , Mrs. Reardon abandons her paperwork and heads down the west corridor , followed by Nurses Perez and Rivers . CAMERA TRACKS as Mrs. Reardon turns to Nurse Rivers . &nbsp; MRS . REARDONAll right , maybe you 'd better call Mrs. Christie .  --  9  --  Phone RINGS . BOCK 'S HOTEL ROOM Dark . Venetian blinds drawn . TV set on , a gray coarse-grained square . PHONE RINGS . DR . HERBERT BOCK , 53 years old , a large man , bulky , disheveled , apparently fell asleep in a chair while watching television the night before . The bed still has its spread on but is rumpled . Bock is in trousers and shirt , collar opened , barefooted . PHONE RINGS . The reading lamp is the only light in the room except for the sheen of gray hissing from the television . Newspapers litter the floor . Books , two-day-old plates of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shirt , a pair of pants , a winter overcoat , a battered gray fedora have been slung about . PHONE on the bedtable RINGS again , begins to penetrate the sotted sleep of the man . Two bottles of booze , one empty , and a clump of glasses are on the coffee table in front of Bock . He grunts , opens an eye . PHONE RINGS . Bock suddenly exsufflates in a snorting grunt . He stands , shuffles to the bed , a big , sodden fellow , picks up the receiver , interrupting its next RING . He sinks , sitting on the bed . &nbsp; BOCKThis is Dr. Bock . . . Yes , Mrs. Christie , what is it ? It 's all right , I 'd be getting up in a few minutes anyway . . . I 'm sorry I missed that . Would you say it again ? Yes , I know him , Schaefer , the stud with the glasses , who fancies the nurses . . . I 'm afraid I do n't understand that , what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he . . . uh , what was the cause of death ? Was he being treated ? I do n't understand . What was he doing in the bed ? You did say he . . . Look , Mrs. Christie , did you call the office ? Good , well , I 'll . . . No , no , it 's all right . I 'll be getting my wake-up call any minute anyway . He returns the receiver to its cradle , sits disoriented , unbuttoning his shirt . HOSPITAL . MORNING . 8:00 A.M LONG SHOT of the hospital , now alive and jumping . Taxis pull up and out of the large U-shaped drive . A noisy picket line of about twenty chanting protesters parade with signs in an uneven ellipse.  --  10  --  &nbsp; GRUMBLING PROTESTERS ( chanting ) Two-four ! Help the poor ! Most of the placards are slogan-y : " PEOPLE YES ! DOCTORS NO ! "  --  " CURE POVERTY ! HEAL THE POOR ! " Two protesters move toward the street , waving and yelling at an approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwich board that goes into the matter at some length : " WE PROTEST THE EVICTION OF 386 BLACK FAMILIES AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR HOMES TO SERVE THE EXPANSIONIST POLICIES OF THIS IMPERIALIST HOSPITAL . " In the back seat of the car sits JOHN SUNDSTROM , handsomely graying , tanned , early fifties , the Director of the Hospital . He looks up . That young demonstrator , DR . IVES , a sandy-haired bespectacled man of 30 in a white doctor 's coat , sidles to the car 's open rear window angrily shouting . &nbsp; DR . IVESWhat do you say , Sundstrom ? How much longer do you think our monopolistic , exclusionary , racist policies will work ? &nbsp; PROTESTERWe 're the hope ! Sundstrom lowers his window and gives his driver directions . He exits in the BACKGROUND parking area , where he notices Bock emerging from his car . Sundstrom waits for him . &nbsp; SUNDSTROMSo how 's it going , Herb ? Bock 's sour glance says it all . He locks his car , joins Sundstrom , and the two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment ) One of my interns dropped dead this morning . &nbsp; SUNDSTROMReally ? I 'm sorry to hear that . I understand you 've moved out to a hotel . &nbsp; BOCKYes . &nbsp; SUNDSTROMIt got that bad with Phyllis ?  --  11  --  &nbsp; BOCKIt 's been that bad for twenty-four years . Are you going to be solicitous ? &nbsp; SUNDSTROMYes . &nbsp; BOCKOh , God . They trudge across the U-shaped entrance drive , pausing to let a car pass . &nbsp; SUNDSTROMListen , Herb , I 'm the guy who brought you into this hospital , so I think I can skip the diplomatic overtures . Marty stopped me in the hall yesterday , very upset . He had just had lunch with you and said you sounded suicidal . Marty tends to be extravagant , but he 's not the only one . Jack Singer mentioned the other day you 've been boozing it up a lot . And let 's face it , you 've been sloughing off . I understand you have n't even been doing rounds . &nbsp; BOCKI 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shuffling line of protesters  --  many with Afro haircuts and tinted glasses , including a black minister and four young white activists . HOSPITAL , HOLLY PAVILION , EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR Early-arriving secretaries chat in the doorways . The corridor itself connects to the Bryce Pavilion ( pediatrics , gynecology and obstetrics ) , so a steady stream of traffic moves back and forth . Bock and Sundstrom enter the corridor and slow to a halt to continue their chat by a wall . &nbsp; SUNDSTROMHerb , want a couple of days off ? &nbsp; BOCKNo . &nbsp; SUNDSTROMGo down to Montego Bay , get drunk , get laid , get a little sun . &nbsp; BOCKFor God 's sake , John , I 'm fifty-three years old with all the  --  12  --  attendant fears . I just left my wife after twenty-four years . Standard case of menopausal melancholy . &nbsp; SUNDSTROMMaybe you ought to have a talk with Joe Einhorn . &nbsp; BOCKI do n't want to see a psychiatrist . Stop worrying about me . All I have to do is get my ass back to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've caused you concern . He sets off down the long corridor to the elevators . MILTON MEAD , the Administrator of the Hospital , comes out of one of the offices , waves a good morning to Bock , who acknowledges him and plods on . Mead comes up to Sundstrom , now moving toward his own office . &nbsp; MILTON MEADSid just called from St. Luke 's , and he 's heard that the demonstrators up there are planning a march to join the bunch down here . &nbsp; SUNDSTROMOh , God . ( He wraps his arm around Mead 's shoulders , ushering him into his office area . ) Did you call the cops ? &nbsp; MILTON MEADYes . HOLLY PAVILION , EIGHTH FLOOR . 8:15 A.M. The elevator door opens . Out comes Bock , overcoat unbuttoned now . He clumps to the Nurses ' Station . An unusual number of nurses seems to be there . Through the doorway of the floor pharmacy , we can see Nurse Rivers of the night shift being comforted by Nurse Perez of the night shift and Nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MRS . DONOVAN , is at the desk hunched over her paperwork . ( Nurses are always hunched over their paperwork . ) NURSE FELICIA CHILE is also seated at the desk doing some paperwork . Head Nurse Donovan looks up briefly as Dr. Bock approaches . &nbsp; MRS . DONOVAN ( back to her paperwork ) They 're all in Eight-O-Six , Doctor .  --  13  --  &nbsp; BOCKWhat happened ? &nbsp; MRS . DONOVANI think I 'll just let Mrs. Christie tell you about it . Bock lumbers off for the west corridor through a press of activity . Kitchen workers trundle creaking portable carts , nurse 's aids and attendants pop in and out of doorways bearing trays and used dishes . A robed patient or two ambulates along the hall . Morning rounds have just started , which means a clump of white-jacketed , white-trousered young doctors are gathered in a gaggle at the far end . The group includes senior resident MONROE BRUBAKER , junior resident HARVEY BIEGELMAN , interns SAM CHANDLER and IRVING AMBLER and another medical student , all lounging outside a door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenting the case from a handful of notecards in his hand . The others lean against the walls , listening . They wear shirts and ties with the exception of Ambler , who is new to the floor and still in the canonical white tunic under his jacket . They are all in their twenties and have swinger sideburns and occasional mustaches . When he spots Dr. Bock , senior resident Brubaker turns the rounds over to Biegelman and joins Bock just outside 806 . &nbsp; BRUBAKER ( as he approaches , rolls his eyes ) Oh boy . &nbsp; BOCKWhat happened ? &nbsp; BRUBAKERI 've seen some pretty good snafus , but this one . . . I mean , there 's a certain splendor to this one . One of the night nurses , a float , thought Schaefer was a patient and plugged an I.V . into him . He was a diabetic , you know . &nbsp; BOCKWhat do you mean , a nurse plugged an I.V . into him ? &nbsp; BRUBAKEROh , it 's really a screwed-up story , Doctor . You see , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who died last night , so the bed was available . And you know Schaefer . He 's Sammy Stud . &nbsp; BOCKAnd he talked a nurse into zapping him on that bed .  --  14  --  &nbsp; BRUBAKERI think it was a girl from hematology he 's been running with . &nbsp; BOCKMy God , it 's a Roman farce . The door to Room 806 opens , and an Assistant Administrator named HITCHCOCK pokes his head out . &nbsp; HITCHCOCKI thought I heard you out here , Doctor . ( He too rolls his eyes heavenward in an expression of incredulity . ) Bock makes a noise and goes into . . . ROOM 806 Aside from Hitchcock , the room includes MRS . CHRISTIE , the Director of Nurses , a fusty forty-six , in streetclothes ; Head Night Nurse , Mrs. Reardon , in uniform ; Head Evening Nurse , MRS . DUNNE , mid-fifties , who had apparently been called in from home because she 's in mufti and wearing a winter coat ; and , of course , the comatose patient and the dead Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; MRS . CHRISTIEI 'll need one from both of you , three copies , and I suggest you do that right now . The forms are in my office . . . Mrs. Dunne , on the verge of tears , head bobbing , looks up to Bock . &nbsp; MRS . DUNNEI 'm really so terribly sorry about this , Dr. Bock . I. . . &nbsp; BOCK ( regarding Schaefer 's rigid death mask ) As I understand it , one of the nurses inadvertently administered an I.V . to Schaefer here . How the hell could that happen ? &nbsp; HITCHCOCKListen , I think we ought to straighten this out somewhere else . &nbsp; MRS . CHRISTIEYes , very good idea . Oh God , what a mess .  --  15  --  They all file out now , Bock in the rear into . . . . HALLWAY , NURSES ' STATION AND LOBBY AREA They all go along to the Nurses ' Station where Mrs. Reardon and Mrs. Dunne disappear into the rooms behind . Mrs. Christie leads Hitchcock and the trailing Bock to the TV-solarium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stands , quietly expounding on the uses of heparin , a decoagulant . One of the patients last night had hemorrhaged consequent to injudicious use of that drug . Listening , the other young doctors make notes . Mrs. Christie leans against the wall . Apparently , the conference is to take place in the corridor . Background activity continues normally . &nbsp; MRS . CHRISTIE ( with a sigh ) Well , these things happen , of course . &nbsp; HITCHCOCKI suppose I 'd better call the Medical Examiner . &nbsp; BOCKI still do n't know what happened . &nbsp; MRS . CHRISTIEWell , it took an hour to get it sorted out . It seems a patient named Guernsey died last night in Eight-O-Six , but that information was n't given to the night nurses . These things happen . Bock has begun to get the drift . A curious state of apathy settles over him . &nbsp; MRS . CHRISTIE ( rattling on ) At any rate , according to the cardex , the patient Guernsey was down for twenty-five milligrams of Sparine Q-6-H , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock shot . Meanwhile , it seems Dr. Schaefer had usurped that particular bed for his own purposes . Dr. Brubaker suggests it was for a love tryst , and some weight is given that hypothesis by the fact that Dr. Schaefer was naked . &nbsp; BOCK ( trying to give his attention to this ) I get the drift , Mrs. Christie . In other words , Nurse Perez went in and sedated Dr. Schaefer thinking it was the patient Guernsey . My God ! What I do n't understand . . . &nbsp; MRS . CHRISTIEIf I may finish , Doctor . Well , after Perez gave him his  --  16  --  shot , she noticed the I.V . on the bed had been pinched off , and she reported that back to Mrs. Reardon , who then assigned Nurse Rivers to restart the I.V . ( Bock sighs . ) Now Rivers was a float . She did n't even know the staff people on the floor , and nobody knew what the patient Guernsey looked like anyway , since he 'd only been admitted that morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; MRS . CHRISTIEYes . &nbsp; BOCKHow much ? &nbsp; MRS . CHRISTIEA liter . &nbsp; BOCK ( The doctor in him intrudes into his lassitude . ) A five percent glucose solution wo n't kill anybody . Did he have any other ancillary conditions ? He was n't dehydrated , was he ? Did n't anybody bother to go in to check him during the night , even under the impression he was merely a patient ? Was he hyperasthmolic ? Did he have a bad heart ? He must have had some kind of thrombosis . I want the post done here , Mr. Hitchcock . And you and I better have a little chat , Mrs. Christie , about your excessive use of float nurses . &nbsp; MRS . CHRISTIEI 've got nearly a thousand nurses in this hospital . &nbsp; BOCK ( gathering rage ) And every time one of them has her period , she disappears for three days . My doctors complain regularly they ca n't find the same nurse on the same floor two days in a row . What the hell am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substitute nurse assassinated him , because she could n't tell the doctors from the patients on the floor ? My God , the incompetence here is absolutely radiant ! I mean , two separate nurses walk into a room , stick needles into a man  --  and one of those was a number eighteen jelco !  --  tourniquet the poor sonofabitch , anchor the poor sonofabitch 's arm with adhesive tape , and it 's the wrong poor sonofabitch ! I mean , my God ! Where do you train your nurses , Mrs. Christie ? Dachau ! ? ( He is aware his voice has risen and is attracting attention . He lowers his voice. )  --  17  --  All right , wrap him up and get him down to Pathology . I 'm especially interested in his blood sugar . A liter of glucose never killed anybody . Your ladies must 've done something else to him . &nbsp; MRS . CHRISTIEWill there be anything else , Doctor ? &nbsp; BOCKNo . &nbsp; HITCHCOCKBefore you call the family , Doctor , I wish you 'd talk to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid litigation . Bock heads abruptly down the corridor to the elevators. &nbsp; pp. 18-41 HOLLY PAVILION , SEVENTH FLOOR , CORRIDOR A corridor of offices . This is the Department of Medicine , where Bock and all the senior staff members of the department have their offices . It 's quiet , since most of the staff are away at their various specialties about the hospital . Bock comes up the corridor still wearing the overcoat he arrived in some hours ago . He has only managed to unbutton it in all the time it has taken him to reach the corner office . Gilt lettering on the door reads : DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE and below that DR . HERBERT E. BOCK . BOCK 'S OFFICE , OUTER OFFICE Small office with two desks . As Department Chief , Bock gets two secretaries . Both are at their desks , one on the phone , MISS GLORIA LEBOW , and the other rattling away on the IBM , MISS STEPHANIE McGUIRE . &nbsp; MISS LEBOW ( mouthing ) Coffee ? It would seem not . Bock waves a listless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OFFICE The modestly imposing office is lined with medical tomes . Bock slips out of his coat and jacket and hangs them in the closet . In shirtsleeves with his tie a bit  --  18  --  askew  --  fastidiousness in dress is not Bock 's strong point  --  he crosses to his desk and sits , breathing more heavily than his small exertions would seem to warrant . He seems exhausted . There is a KNOCK on the door . Miss Lebow enters , holding a filing envelope stuffed with papers . &nbsp; MISS LEBOWA few things have been piling up . Would you like to go into them ? A guttural noise indicates yes . Miss Lebow pulls up a chair , opens her folder . &nbsp; MISS LEBOWA quickie . Dr. Esterhazy wants to start hiring temporary people to cover the summer vacations . He says last year some of the replacement people did n't receive their checks until they waited six months . He wonders if you could do something about getting these people paid more promptly . She places a sheet of paper on the desk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . &nbsp; MISS LEBOW ( drones on ) Miss Aronovici complains the lab reports are coming in slow into the E.R. I called Dr. Immelman about that , and she said three microscopes have been stolen out of her lab in the last two months . Charley Waters also complains about pilferage . I 've clumped all those together for you . . . ( She lays a sheaf of memos in front of Bock , who stares at them blankly . ) Now , as you know , Doctor , we 've agreed to take over the local ambulance cases as part of the hospital 's commitment to the community , and it 's created a serious overload in the E.R. I do n't know why this was dumped in our lap , but . . . Bock obviously is n't up to all this . He waves a limp hand to stop Miss Lebow 's morning report . &nbsp; BOCK ( staring at his desktop ) Find out if Dr. Einhorn is in his office yet . &nbsp; MISS LEBOWWhich Dr. Einhorn ? Ophthalmology or Psychiatry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll look in myself .  --  19  --  He lumbers across the room and out into . . . BOCK 'S OUTER OFFICE . . . and down past Miss McGuire , rattling away on her IBM , and out into . . . HOLLY PAVILION , SEVENTH FLOOR , CORRIDOR . . . down past several closed doors , stopping at a door marked DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY , DR . JOSEPH EINHORN . He enters . DR . EINHORN 'S OFFICE , SECRETARY 'S OFFICE A secretary at her desk , sips coffee and reads a paperback novel . &nbsp; BOCKIs he in ? The doctor is obviously in . He can be seen through the open door sitting at his desk writing in a notebook . Bock leans in . &nbsp; BOCKCan you give me a few minutes , Joe ? &nbsp; EINHORN ( short , chunky , bespectacled , late fifties ) Of course . Bock goes in , closes the door behind himself . DR . EINHORN 'S OFFICE Bock looks only at the floor . &nbsp; BOCK ( ill at ease ) I 've been having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming noticeable . A number of people have remarked on it . Anyway , John Sundstrom thought it might be a good idea if I spoke to you about it . &nbsp; EINHORNDo you want to sit down , Herb ? &nbsp; BOCKNo . I 'm not good at confessional . ( He ambles around . ) Well ,  --  20  --  what can I tell you ? The last year , two , three . . . it goes way back , I suppose . I can remember entertaining suicidal thoughts as a college student . At any rate , I 've always found life demanding . I 'm an only child of lower-middle-class people . I was the glory of my parents . My son the doctor . Well , you know . I was always top of my class . Scholarship to Harvard . The boy genius , the brilliant eccentric . Terrified of women , clumsy at sports .

Out of respect for the hospital corridor and the people working around him and Brubaker , he keeps it glacial .

Bock seizes it . &nbsp; BOCKYeah . . . Gilley ? Put him on . Bock . Did n't you tell me a couple of months ago you were going to cut off all privileges for that assassin , Welbeck ? Yeah . Wellbeck . He just butchered another one of my patients . . . Oh , come on , Harry ! The man 's a buccaneer ! I want him brought before the Medical Executive Committee . . . . He 's in your department , Harry , not mine . He 's putatively a surgeon ! . . . I 'll be here !

He blinks at Lagerman . &nbsp; BOCKWhat do you mean , Ives is dead ? &nbsp; DR . LAGERMANI mean he 's dead . He had a heart attack in the Emergency Room . &nbsp; BOCKHe had a heart attack in the Emergency Room ? &nbsp; DR . LAGERMANYeah . &nbsp; BOCK ( blinking ) What the hell is this ? Some kind of plague ? ( stands ) Where is he now ? &nbsp; DR . LAGERMANThey were just taking him down to Pathology . pp. 1-17 &nbsp; pp. 42-55 HOLLY PAVILION , FIRST FLOOR , PATHOLOGY DEPT Bock , Lagerman and Hitchcock have gathered across the shrouded figure of Dr. Ives on a stretcher . We are in the lab section of Pathology ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separating the lab from the surgery room , we can see the autopsy on Dr. Schaefer being performed . Schaefer 's naked white cadaver is stretched out on an operating table . He has been opened up and all his vital organs are being excised . It 's bloody . The autopsy is being performed by DR . BREWSTER , the Resident in Pathology , dressed in surgical scrub . &nbsp; HITCHCOCK . . . and the next thing anybody knew , about three hours later , Mrs. Cushing from Accounting came in and said there was a dead man in the Holding Room . &nbsp; BOCKYou do n't find anything grotesque about all this ? &nbsp; HITCHCOCKWhat do you mean ? &nbsp; BOCKI mean , at half past eight this morning , we meet over a doctor who 's been killed intravenously , and here we are again , four hours  --  42  --  later , with another doctor who had a heart attack in the Emergency Room . &nbsp; HITCHCOCKWell , what 're you suggesting Doctor ? Do you think we have a mad killer stalking the halls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart attack and Schaefer in a diabetic coma . People do die of these things . It 's all perhaps coincidental , but I do n't think I 'd call it grotesque . &nbsp; BOCKHow long are they going to be on Schaefer 's post ? He knocks on the glass window of the door separating the laboratory from the operating room . Dr. Brewster turns from his gory chore . Bock makes a gesture saying , " How much longer ? " Brewster raises ten blood-drenched rubber-gloved fingers . Bock turns and shuffles across the lab for the door out . &nbsp; BOCK ( pauses at door , to Lagerman ) I do n't suppose you 'd like to call next of kin ? &nbsp; DR . LAGERMANNo thanks . &nbsp; BOCK ( deeply depressed ) Oh God , I need a drink . He goes down . . . THE PATHOLOGY CORRIDOR . . . and is soon lost in the normal traffic of the area . THE HOSPITAL . NIGHT CRASH of THUNDER . CRACKLE of LIGHTNING . A horror-film rainstorm lashes the vast dark complex of buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , empty , silent . One lonely light at the lobby end of the long , closed corridor of offices . The door to Bock 's office stands ajar and issues a trace of light .  --  43  --  BOCK 'S OFFICE ACROSS the silent , dark , typewriter-covered desks of the two secretaries through the doorway to Bock 's private office , we can see Bock at his desk , lit by the desk lamp . He has a bottle of booze on his desk . He gets up from his desk . He has made a decision . HOLLY PAVILION , EIGHTH FLOOR The corridors are silent ; the night lights are on , subdued . Head Evening Nurse Mrs. Dunne is back at her desk , hunched over paperwork . Resident Brubaker passes by . EIGHTH FLOOR , PHARMACY Nurse SHERLEE DEVINE , a black woman in her mid-twenties , has a porcelain tray on the shelf onto which she puts a small jar of alcohol , cotton swabs , a wrapped hypodermic needle and syringe . She moves out into . . . NURSES ' STATION . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; NURSE DEVINEMead . Mrs. Dunne nods . Nurse Devine makes her way silently down the sleeping doors to . . . ROOM 806 Dark , sleeping . The bathroom light is on , but only a thin stream of yellow light trickles through the door . THUNDER CRASHES . William Mead sleeps fitfully . The other patient is entirely curtained off . Nurse Devine sets her tray on Mead 's bedtable , turns on the goose-neck lamp , keeping it from his eyes . She unwraps the hypodermic syringe , sets in the needle , draws the required dosage , reaches over and gently shakes Mead by the shoulder .  --  44  --  &nbsp; NURSE DEVINE ( softly ) Mr. Mead . . . Mr. Mead , I have an injection for you . Mead sleeps on . Expressionlessly , Nurse Devine extracts Mead 's right arm from under the sheets , wets a swab with alcohol and rubs down the vein . The needle slides into Mead 's vein . OVER THIS , we begin to hear a distant sibilant HISSING , indistinct like the leakage of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not quite civilized sound . CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY to Nurse Devine withdrawing the needle , looking up , for she too has heard the soft , strange sounds . They emanate from behind the curtains of the other bed . Nurse Devine returns the syringe to the tray , gathers her things and pads silently around Mead 's bed to Drummond 's bed . With her free hand , she opens the curtains a little and stares in . &nbsp; NURSE DEVINEWhat the hell is going on in there ? NURSE DEVINE 'S P.O.V. : The Indian and BARBARA DRUMMOND bend over Drummond performing some pagan ritual . The HISSING is Barbara 's contribution to the ceremony . ( It sounds like pis-pis , and is in fact an imitation of the nighthawk , meant to appease the spirit of the thunder . ) The old Indian has stripped to the waist and marked his body with smears of dye and tule pollen . He wears a ceremonial hat , a sort of beaded beanie . He holds a small buckskin bag of pollen in his cupped palms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering the bag and prayers under his breath as he does . A beaded amulet lies stretched across the white sheet covering the comatose Drummond . When Nurse Devine draws the curtains , Barbara frowns at Nurse Devine , holds a cautioning finger to her lips and draws the curtains closed again . Nurse Devine , carrying her porcelain tray , exits . EIGHTH FLOOR , NURSES ' STATION Bock comes out of the elevator , jacketed now , fairly drunk but holding it well .  --  45  --  He heads for the Nurses ' Station as Nurse Devine comes down the west corridor . Bock grunts at Mrs. Dunne and goes into . . . PHARMACY . . . where he quickly runs his finger along the second shelf until he comes to the bottle of potassium which he filches off the shelf and slips into his pocket . He rummages through the drawers for a hypodermic syringe . Through the open doorway , we see Nurse Devine making her way swiftly up to Mrs. Dunne at the desk . &nbsp; NURSE DEVINEWell , honey , we got a witch-doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know that Indian that was sitting in Eight-O-Six all night ? He 's still there , and the girl 's there , and they 're doing some voodoo in there , and I ai n't kidding . Behind Mrs. Dunne , Bock appears in the doorway to the pharmacy where he stands listening . &nbsp; MRS . DUNNE ( looking up ) What are you talking about ? &nbsp; NURSE DEVINEI mean that Indian 's in there , half-naked and going pis-pis-pis with a little bag . You just better get in there , Mrs. Dunne . Mrs. Dunne , annoyed , gets up and heads for the west corridor , followed by Nurse Devine and by an intrigued Dr. Bock at a few paces behind . &nbsp; NURSE DEVINE ( to NURSE WEITZENBAUM , coming out of another room ) You want to see somethin ' , baby ? You jus ' come here . As the small procession bears down , Barbara Drummond slips out of that room to intercept them . &nbsp; BARBARA ( keeping her voice low ) Look , it 's a perfectly harmless ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in a few minutes anyway . Mr. Blacktree is a shaman who gets his power from the thunder , and it 's imperative he conclude his rituals while the storm is still going on .  --  46  --  &nbsp; NURSE DUNNEVisiting hours were over at nine o'clock , Miss . Bock reaches for the door to the room . &nbsp; BARBARAAll that 's going on in there , Doctor , is a simple Apache prayer for my father 's recovery . Bock makes a vague noise , neither contradicting her nor assenting , and continues around her into . . . ROOM 806 As Bock slides in , a bit of the corridor light comes in with him . The curtains have been left sufficiently open to reveal Mr. Blacktree . He is still stripped to the waist and marked with crosses of pollen . He extends two twigs to the four directions after which he places the twigs carefully on the white sheet covering Drummond in a pattern around the amulet already there . Behind Bock , Mrs. Dunne can be seen peeking in . The Indian is oblivious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest for a moment and then backs out into . . . EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR . . . closing the door after him . &nbsp; BARBARAThe markings he 's made on my father 's arms are from the pollen of the tule plant . The twigs have no significance other than they 've been struck by lightning and are consequently appeals to the spirit of lightning . It 's all entirely harmless , a religious ceremony , not a medical one . &nbsp; BOCKYou do n't seriously believe all that mumbo-jumbo will cure him ? &nbsp; BARBARAOn the other hand , it wo n't kill him , Doctor . They regard each other levelly . &nbsp; BOCK ( grunts ) Okay . Go ahead .  --  47  --  He wheels and clumps off for the stairway exit . &nbsp; BARBARAThank you . Nurse Weitzenbaum opens the door of the room and peeks in . At the stairway exit , Bock pauses to look back at all the women in front of Room 806 . &nbsp; BOCKMiss Drummond , are you still taking your father out ? &nbsp; BARBARAYes . I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone around I could use ? &nbsp; BOCKUse my office . &nbsp; BARBARAThank you . Bock exits . Barbara edges past Weitzenbaum , who is still peeking into the room . ROOM 806 Barbara comes in , gathers her coat and purse from a chair and moves to the Indian , now occupied with what seems to be the rolling of a cigarette . The two exchange a brief dialogue in Apache . The old Indian nods . Barbara turns and exits , taking Nurse Weitzenbaum out with her and closing the door . The room is dark and hushed again . Blacktree lights his cigarette and " sends the smoke up , " a ritual which consists of puffing smoke to each of the four directions , muttering in Apache " May all be well " after each puff . CAMERA SLOWLY PANS to the other bed where William Mead sleeps fitfully . The Apache words and pis-pis-pis penetrate Mead 's drugged sleep . He opens one eyelid and stares glazedly at the dark air . The SOUNDS persist . Blacktree chooses this moment to sidle out from behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of Drummond 's bed . It 's quite a sight for a nervous , sedated man to wake to . Thunder RUMBLES and the rain SLASHES and a sudden , savage STREAK of lightning illuminates it all .  --  48  --  Mead figures it 's all a bad dream and , after a moment of dully regarding the odd spectacle , closes his one eye and goes back to sleep . BOCK 'S OFFICE , OUTER OFFICE Barbara Drummond comes in . Bock has apparently turned the lights on for her , but Bock himself is not immediately visible . She looks through the half-open door to Bock 's private office , and there he is , staring blankly at the bottle . Barbara starts to say something , thinks better of it , lays down her coat , and looking around , spots a Manhattan classified directory which she hauls up from its shelf and sets on Miss Lebow 's desk . She sits , quickly flips through the pages . Barbara flips through the directory . Bock is partially visible in the background at his desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens her purse and takes out two airplane tickets . She dials . The CLICKING of the dial catches Bock 's ear . He looks up for a moment . &nbsp; BARBARA ( on phone ) Hello . I 'd like to arrange an ambulance for one-thirty tomorrow afternoon . . . Thank you . . . REVERSE ACROSS Bock at his desk with Barbara partially visible at Miss Lebow 's desk . All he can see are her great long tanned legs . &nbsp; BARBARA ( in background on phone ) . . . Drummond , first name , Barbara . I 'll pay cash . . . Bock stands a little unsteadily and moves around his desk to get a better look at those legs . &nbsp; BARBARA ( on phone ) No , you 're to pick up my father , Drummond , Edward , at the Manhattan Medical Center , Holly Pavilion , Room Eight-O-Six . It 's a stretcher case . I presume you provide the stretcher . She senses Bock watching her , turns , smiles . She 's a very beautiful girl . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to American Airlines , Yes . . . No . . . Kennedy  --  49  --  Airport , Flight Seven-Two-Nine to Yuma , Arizona . I 'll accompany the patient . . . Yes , thank you . She returns the receiver to its cradle . When she looks up again , Bock is no longer there . She returns the flight tickets to her purse , snaps it shut , stands and moves to the doorway , enters a step into . . . BOCK 'S OFFICE Bock , back at his desk , looks up . &nbsp; BOCKYou believe in witchcraft , Miss Drummond ? &nbsp; BARBARAI believe in everything , Doctor . &nbsp; BOCKLike a drink ? &nbsp; BARBARAYes . Bock drains his glass and pours her a hefty shot of bourbon . &nbsp; BARBARA ( from the door suddenly ) My father , you should know , was a very successful doctor in Boston , a member of the Harvard Medical Faculty . He was a widower , and I was his only child . He was not an especially religious man , a sober Methodist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Pentecostal meeting in the commons rooms at Harvard and suddenly found himself speaking in tongues . ( She takes her drink and crosses to the sofa . ) That is to say , he suddenly sank to his knees at the back of the room and began to talk fluently in a language which no one had ever heard before . This sort of thing happens frequently at Pentecostal meetings , and they began to happen regularly to my father . ( She sits . ) It was not unusual to walk into our home and find my father sitting in his office , utterly serene and happily speaking to the air in this strange foreign tongue . I was , at that time twenty years old and having my obligatory affair with a minority group , in my case a Hopi Indian , a post-graduate fellow at Harvard doing his doctorate in the aboriginal languages of the Southwest . One day , I brought the Indian boy home just as my father was sinking to his  --  50  --  knees in the entrance foyer in one of his trances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I 'll be a sonofabitch . " You see , my father was speaking an Apache dialect , an obscure dialect at that , spoken only by a ragged band of unreconstructed Indians who had rejected the reservation and were living in total isolation in the Sierra Madre Mountains of northern Mexico . Well ! What do you say to that , Dr. Bock ? &nbsp; BOCK ( who has been staring at her as if she were insane ) What the hell am I supposed to say to that , Miss Drummond ? Barbara throws back her head and roars with laughter . &nbsp; BOCKI 'm sitting here boozing and , all of a sudden , you start telling me some demented story about your father 's religious conversion . &nbsp; BARBARANo , no , you miss the point , Doctor . Not my father 's conversion  --  mine . You see , I had been hitting the acid pretty regularly at that time . I had achieved a few minor sensory deformities , some suicidal despairs , but nothing as wild as fluency in an obscure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I mean , here was living afflatus right before my eyes ! Within a week , my father had closed his Beacon Hill practice and set out to start a mission in the Mexican mountains . And I turned in my S.D.S. card and my crash helmet and followed him . It was a disaster , at least for me . My father had received the revelation , not I. He stood gaunt on a mountain slope and preached the apocalypse to solemnly amused Indians . I masturbated a great deal . We lived in a grass wickiup and ate raw rabbit and crushed pion nuts . It was hideous . Within two months , I was back in Boston , a hollow shell and dizzy with dengue , disenchanted with everything . I turned to austerity , combed my hair tight and entered nursing school . I became haggard , driven and had shamelessly incestuous dreams about my father . I took up with some of the senior staff at the hospital . One of them , a portly psychiatrist , explained I was generated by an unresolved lust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , they found me walking to work naked and screaming obscenities . There was talk of institutionalizing me , so I packed a bag and went back to my father in the Sierra Madre Mountains . I 've been  --  51  --  there ever since . That 's three years . My father is , of course , mad as a hatter . I watch over him and have been curiously content . You see , Doctor , I believe in everything . She pauses , her story over . Throughout , Bock has been trying to keep his glowering eye on the desktop . During her long narrative , he once seized the bottle and took a swig . Mostly he is finding the experience murkily sensual . His glance keeps darting out from under his brows to surreptitiously look at the beautiful long tanned legs ; or , when she bends for the drink she set on the floor , to peer down the flapping open scalloped neck of her dress ; she is bra-less . She , on the other hand , has been crossing and uncrossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short dress has ridden up almost to her waist and is saved from utter exhibitionism only by the darkness of the shadows . She seems unaffected by Bock 's voyeuristic interest in her , but she is surely not unaware of it . It is hard to believe she is not courting his attention . &nbsp; BOCKNow what was that all about , Miss Drummond ? &nbsp; BARBARAI thought I was obvious as hell . I 'm trying to tell you I have a thing for middle-aged men . &nbsp; BOCKI admire your candor . &nbsp; BARBARAYou 've been admiring a lot more than that . Bock looks up , and they suddenly find their eyes locked . The dark , dense air in the room fairly steams with incipient sexuality . &nbsp; BOCK ( looks down again ) You 're wasting your time . I 've been impotent for years . &nbsp; BARBARARubbish . With a crash of his fist on the desktop , Bock stands ; he is in a drunken rage . &nbsp; BOCK ( lurches about ) What the hell 's wrong with being impotent ? My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Victorians ! I 've got  --  52  --  a son , twenty-three . I threw him out of the house last year . Pietistic little humbug . He preached universal love and despised everyone . He had a blanket contempt for the middle class , even its decencies . He detested my mother because she had petit bourgeois pride in her son the doctor . I can not tell you how brutishly he ignored that rather good old lady . When she died , he did n't even come to the funeral . He thought the chapel service an hypocrisy . His generation did n't live with lies , he told me . " Everybody lives with lies , " I said . I grabbed him by his poncho , dragged him the full length of our seven-room despicably affluent middle-class apartment and flung him out . I have n't seen him since . But do you know what he said to me as he stood there on that landing on the verge of tears . He shrieked at me : " You old fink ! You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see . That was his real revolution . It was n't racism and the oppressed poor and the war in Vietnam . The ultimate American societal sickness was a limp dingus . Hah ! ( He lurches about , laughing rustily . ) My God , if there is a despised and misunderstood minority in this country , it 's us poor impotent bastards . Well , I 'm impotent and proud of it ! Impotence is beautiful , baby ! ( He raises a militant fist . ) Power to the Impotent ! Right on , baby ! &nbsp; BARBARA ( smiling ) Right on . &nbsp; BOCK ( stares drunkenly at her ) When I say impotent , I do n't mean merely limp . Disagreeable as it may be for a woman , a man may sometimes lust for other things , something less transient than an erection , some sense of permanent worth . That 's what medicine was for me , my reason for being . When I was thirty-four , Miss Drummond , I presented a paper before the annual convention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of immunology . A breakthrough ! I 'm in all the textbooks . I happen to be an eminent man , Miss Drummond . And you want to know something , Miss Drummond ? I do n't give a goddam . When I say I 'm impotent , I mean I 've lost even my desire for work , which is a hell of a lot more primal a passion than sex . I 've lost my raison d'etre , my purpose , the only thing I ever truly loved . It 's all rubbish anyway . Transplants , antibodies , we manufacture genes , we can produce birth ectogenetically , we can practically clone people like carrots , and half  --  53  --  the kids in this ghetto have n't even been inoculated for polio ! We have assembled the most enormous medical establishment ever conceived , and people are sicker than ever ! We cure nothing ! We heal nothing ! The whole goddam wretched world is strangulating in front of our eyes ! That 's what I mean when I say impotent ! You do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; BARBARAOf course , I do . &nbsp; BOCKI 'm tired , I 'm terribly tired , Miss Drummond . And I hurt , and I 've got nothing going for me anymore . Can you understand that ? &nbsp; BARBARAYes , of course . &nbsp; BOCKThen can you understand that the only admissable matter left is death ? He suspects he is going to cry and turns quickly away . He sits heavily and fights his tears . &nbsp; BARBARASounds to me like a familiar case of morbid menopause . &nbsp; BOCKOh Christ . &nbsp; BARBARAWell , it 's hard for me to take your despair very seriously , Doctor . You obviously enjoy it so much . &nbsp; BOCKOh , bugger off . That 's all I need now , clinical insights . Some cockamamie twenty-five-year-old . . . &nbsp; BARBARATwenty-seven . &nbsp; BOCK. . . acidhead 's going to reassure me about menopause now . Look , I 'd like to be alone , so why do n't you beat it ? Close the door and turn off the lights on your way out . They are both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They look  --  54  --  to the door where Mr. Blacktree , fully clothed again and carrying his coat , is standing in the doorway . Barbara uncrosses her long legs and stands . &nbsp; BARBARA ( crossing to the door ) Mr. Blacktree disapproves of my miniskirt , but it was the only thing I had to come to the city with . Back at the tribe , I wear ankle-length buckskin . &nbsp; BOCKSwell . Just close the door and turn off the lights . Barbara regards his hunched form and , murmuring in Apache , she exits , closing the door . In the subsequent hush , thunder RUMBLES and CRASHES . Wind sweeps the rain against the window panes . The sounds go unheeded by Bock , still as marble . Slowly , he raises his head and sighs and then fishes about in his jacket pockets to bring out the bottle of potassium and syringe . He takes off his jacket , rolling up his shirtsleeve , poking about for the vein . He removes his trouser belt , which he ties tightly about his upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapping of the syringe and fits the needle to it . Fiddling about in the pockets of his jacket , he finally finds a crumpled pack of cigarettes . He lights one and returns to the business of killing himself , puffing expressionlessly as he does . Thunder RUMBLES and rain SLASHES . He carefully draws just the right amount of potassium from the bottle to the syringe , peering at the procedure against the light of his desk lamp . He sets the cigarette on the ashtray , switches the hypodermic to his right hand , holds his left arm rigidly out under the light of the lamp . . . &nbsp; BARBARA 'S VOICE ( off-screen ) What 're you shooting , Doc ? He turns slowly to the doorway , his bare left arm still rigidly extended , the belt dangling , the hypodermic clenched in his other hand . Barbara is perfectly framed in the doorway . He stares at her , slowly suffusing with the numb , blind , total rage of the aborted suicide . The thunder CRASHES . &nbsp; BOCK ( barely gets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches the desk affably , turns the potassium around to read the label .  --  55  --  &nbsp; BARBARAPotassium . You take enough of this stuff , it 'll kill you , Doc . ( moves toward the couch ) It occurred to me that I might have read you wrong , that you really were suicidal . So I came back . Bock 's rage erupts . He crashes the hypodermic syringe down , shattering it . The potassium puddles on the wood . &nbsp; BOCK ( hysterical rage ) Who the hell asked you ! He moves around the desk , a shambling bear of a man , a leather belt dangling dementedly from his arm , tears coursing down his cheeks . He advances on her in a stuperous shuffle . &nbsp; BOCKWho the hell asked you ! She regards his lumbering approach with a faint , grotesquely sensual smile . He reaches with his naked left arm to the neck of her dress and , with one savage wrench , rips her stark naked , sobbing through hysterical tears . &nbsp; BOCKLeave me alone ! Why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her , crushing her down into the shadows of the couch , ravenous at her neck and shoulders in a brutish assault , sobbing . &nbsp; BOCKWhy did n't you let me do it ? Who the hell asked you ! Throughout the scene , CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN through the flesh and fury to an INTENSE TWO-SHOT of this terrified act of love . Then slowly over Bock 's plunging shoulder to the woman 's face . She gasps at the moment of penetration , then her lovely face slowly shapes into smiling serenity . Bock sobs ; even in the shadows we can see the path of the tears on his cheek . ABRUPT SILENCE . pp. 18-41 &nbsp; pp. 56-72 OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL , NIGHT . 4:00 A.M. The quiet , black streets glisten wetly in the puddles of lamplight.  --  56  --  THE STEINMETZ PAVILION , TENTH FLOOR The night shift is finishing up . THERESA CAMPANELLA , R.N. , a high-strung girl in her early twenties , stands at a water tap holding a glass and popping some pills in her mouth . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR . NIGHT Campanella comes out of the Dialysis room , puts on her coat and walks to . . . HOLLY PAVILION LOBBY . NIGHT Campanella moves down the empty corridor . All the doors are closed now ; only the overhead light in the background of the corridor glows weakly . Campanella puts a cigarette in her mouth , pauses to look for matches ; she has n't any . Scowling with annoyance , she continues to the lobby and stops by a partially visible white-jacketed figure reading a newspaper . &nbsp; CAMPANELLADo you have a match , Doctor ? She takes the matches , lights her cigarette , inhaling deeply , when he suddenly sandbags her from behind . She goes down . BOCK 'S OFFICE . DAYBREAK , WEDNESDAY Covered by Bock 's overcoat , Barbara tosses and turns on the couch in a small nightmare . Through the windows comes the first gray wash of dawn . FULL SHOT of Barbara , awake and up on one elbow on the verge of a scream . She looks around the room . It is dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to the secretarial office . It is likewise dark , but suddenly the lights go on and , a moment later , Bock enters . He holds a container of coffee in each hand and has something white draped over his forearm . From under Bock 's bulky coat , Barbara watches him lumber to his desk , where he sets the containers of coffee down . He drops the whitish garment over the back of a chair and then sits . He hoists a bulging  --  57  --  folder of correspondence from his filing tray and hunches to work , reading . After a moment , he regards the silent figure on the couch across the room . &nbsp; BOCKYou would n't be awake . &nbsp; BARBARAWhat time is it ? He rises , picks up the second container and white dress from the chair . She reaches out an arm for the coffee . Bock holds up  --  a nurse 's uniform . &nbsp; BOCKI swiped this for you out of the nurses ' locker room . I 'll make good on your dress . I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or , if you like , give me your size and I 'll send it on to you . But I want to talk to you about that . &nbsp; BARBARATalk to me about what ? &nbsp; BOCKAbout your father . You really should n't move him in his condition . I just had a look at his chart . There 's no reason to presume brain damage . You know as well as I you ca n't predict anything in these instances . He could pull out of that coma at any time . I think you should let him stay here . I 'll personally look after him . He has perched on the edge of the couch , and she rests her cheek against the long , bent curve of his back , smiling . &nbsp; BARBARAIs this your way of saying you 'd like me to stay in town a few more days ? He turns to look at her , smiles back . &nbsp; BOCKWell , that would be nice , too . She sips her coffee . &nbsp; BOCKWhat do you say , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me Barbara , considering you ravished me three times last night . &nbsp; BOCKThree times ? &nbsp; BARBARAOh , look at him , pretending he did n't count .

I 'll call you Herb . &nbsp; BOCKLet 's give your father a week , Barbara , what do you say ? &nbsp; BARBARA ( A frown darkens her face . ) No , I do n't want my father in this hospital . I had a dream about this hospital . ( Some of the terror shows on her face . ) I dreamt this enormous starched white tile building suddenly erupted like a volcano , and all the patients , doctors , nurses , attendants , orderlies , the whole line staff , the food service people , the aged , the lame  --  and you right in the middle  --  were stampeding in one hideous screaming suicidal mass into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliving the dream . ) I 'm taking my father out of here  --  and as quickly as I can . They stare at each other , she in terror , he with affection . &nbsp; BOCKYou 're a real fruitcake , you know ? She sets her coffee down on the couch and decides to wear Bock 's overcoat rather than use it as a cover . She searches for the sleeves . Bock assists her . &nbsp; BARBARAWell , let me put it this way . I love you . I fancied you from the first moment you came lumbering down that hallway upstairs . I said to Mr. Blacktree , " Who 's that hulking bear of a man ? " The Apaches are reverential about bears . They wo n't eat bear meat ; they never skin bears . Bear is thought of as both benign and evil , but very strong power . Men with bear power are highly respected and are frequently said to be great healers.  --  59  --  By now she 's standing , the overcoat reaching her toes .

If he dies , he dies , but I 'm taking him out of here and back to Mexico about one o'clock this afternoon . I want you to come with us , because I love you and want children . &nbsp; BOCKI 'm afraid Mexico sounds a little too remote for me . &nbsp; BARBARAWe could use you down there , you know .

How did we get to love and children all of a sudden ? &nbsp; BARBARAOh , for heaven 's sake , Herb , I ought to know if a man loves me or not . You must have told me half a hundred times last night you loved me . You murmured it , shouted it ; one time , you opened the window and bellowed it out into the street . &nbsp; BOCKI think those were more expressions of gratitude than love . &nbsp; BARBARAGratitude for what ? &nbsp; BOCKWell , my God , for resurrecting feelings of life in me I thought dead .  --  60  --  &nbsp; BARBARAWell , my God , what do you think love is ? &nbsp; BOCKOkay , I love you , and you love me . I 'm not about to argue with so relentless a romantic .

My God , half the time you 're a perfectly intelligent young woman , and then suddenly you turn into a goddam cabalist who believes in dreams , witchcraft and bear power ! And I do n't like the way you dismiss my whole life as unnecessary . I do a lot of healing right here in Manhattan . I do n't have to go to Mexico for it . I also teach . I send out eighty doctors a year into the world , sometimes inspirited , at least competent . I 've built up one of the best damned departments of medicine in the world .

Mr. Blacktree does n't speak any English . &nbsp; BOCK ( from the connecting doorway ) Well , you 're coming back , of course . &nbsp; BARBARAOf course . I have to settle the bill here and pack my father . And I think you need a few hours alone to make your decisions . &nbsp; BOCKWhat decisions ? &nbsp; BARBARAYou 're a very tired and very damaged man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few tacky affairs along the way . You 're understandably reluctant to get involved again . And , on top of that , here I am with the preposterous idea you throw everything up and go off with me to some barren mountains of Mexico . It sounds utterly mad , I know . On the other hand , you obviously find this world as desolate as I do . You did try to kill yourself last night . So that 's it , Herb . Either me and the mountains or the bottle of potassium . I 'll be back in an hour or so . I 'll be in my father 's room . She slips into her coat and exits , as Bock looks after her thoughtfully , then turns back to his own office .

At the far end , an anesthetized patient , blue in the harsh light , fresh from surgery , is being wheeled into a recovery room .

A large blackboard faces the Supervisor 's Office with the  --  68  --  day 's schedule of operations neatly chalked in . It is full .

I hold a controlling interest in a number of proprietary hospitals , nursing homes and rest farms , and I 've been leasing hospital equipment to my own hospitals at excessive rates . Why , you ask , am I draining my own hospitals ? Well , my hospitals are taxed at 48 percent , and I 'm giving my leasing company a hell of a price-earnings ratio , which 'll balloon the market value of the stock .

Bock rolls back the curtains around Drummond 's bed revealing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an I.V . tube in his right arm , a catheter projecting from under the sheet . Bock lowers the protective railing , leans in , takes the man 's pulse on his neck , raises one closed eyelid , then the  --  82  --  other . The pupils stare vacuously back at him ; the eyelids drop closed as soon as they are released . In the background , the orderly and aid finish tucking in William Mead and exit , wheeling their creaking stretcher out . The room is shockingly silent . Bock goes to the window and frowns in thought . HOLD ACROSS the patient Drummond , on Bock in the background at the window with his back to us . Suddenly , Drummond 's eyes open . He lies rigid , his eyes staring dementedly into the air above him . Slowly , his left hand reaches out and carefully withdraws the catheter from his bladder , lays it on the white sheet beside him , and silently reaches over to withdraw the I.V . needle from his right arm . He lets the needle dangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from under his sheet , swings his legs over the side of the bed and sits up . REVERSE ACROSS Bock at the window , pondering . With a swift lash of movement , the double tubes of a stethoscope are whipped over his head and tightened around his throat . &nbsp; DRUMMOND ( mad as a hatter ) I am the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca .

He 's already killed two doctors and one nurse . &nbsp; DRUMMONDI am the wrath of the lamb and the angel of the bottomless pit . &nbsp; BARBARAWhat do you mean he killed two doctors and a nurse ? &nbsp; BOCKI mean , he 's killed two doctors and a nurse ! And he just tried to kill me ! He has something against doctors . Somehow he got hold of a thousand units of insulin and put it in Dr. Schaefer 's intravenous solution .

Do n't look at me like I 'm the one who 's crazy . Ask your crazy father ! &nbsp; DRUMMONDI was merely an instrument of God . I killed no one . They all three died by their own hands , ritual victims of their own institutions , murdered by irony , an eye for an eye , biblical retribution .

She solicitously helps the wispy old man off with his coat and jacket and hat which she puts in the armoire . With palsied fingers , the little old man unknots his stringy tie and unbuttons the collar , which is three sizes too large . In the other bed , Drummond 's eyes slowly open . &nbsp; DRUMMOND ( off-screen ) I was instantly aware of a divine presence . The old man is slipping out of his clothes to expose a thin little body in a torn nightshirt . &nbsp; DRUMMOND ( off-screen ) I was convinced this porcelain old man was , in fact , an Angel of the Lord . . . The old man sits back , wheezing a little . Nurse Chile smiles nicely at him and takes her leave . For a moment , Drummond lies rigidly on his bed , staring dully into the air and the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room is silent except for his rheumy wheeze . &nbsp; DRUMMOND ( off-screen ) . . . perhaps even Christ Himself . After a moment , the old man rises and goes to the washbasin and , with some wheezing , spits into it . He shuffles back to bed . Dr. Schaefer comes into the room with a professional smile and the patient Guernsey 's chart . &nbsp; DRUMMOND ( off-screen ) Our Savior was , it seems , suffering from emphysema . Schaefer perches on the bed beside Guernsey and begins to take his history . &nbsp; DRUMMOND ( off-screen ) He was relentlessly subjected to the benefits of modern medicine . He was misdiagnosed , mismedicated , and put into shock by Dr. Schaefer ; raced off to Intensive Care , where the resident compounded the blunder and induced a coma . I can tell you  --  85  --  with authority that God is indeed dead . He died last Monday under the name of Guernsey .

Drummond 's eyes open and roll to the direction of the voice . DRUMMOND 'S P.O.V. : Guernsey , dressed only in his hospital shift , is shuffling up and down the aisle of the room , hands clasped behind his back like a Mittel-European intellectual , head hunched forward  --  a little old man with a white beard talking to himself . &nbsp; GUERNSEYThose who killed you and those who killed me will die in our place . You are the Paraclete of Caborca , the wrath of the lamb . The angel of the bottomless pit .

The end is at hand !

His thin , high nose projects from the whiteness of his face . He sighs the rattling last sigh of life and dies . CAMERA DOLLIES slowly to CLOSE-UP of Drummond lying motionless on his bed . His eyes are wide , glinting in the shadows , a man imbued . His cheeks are wet with tears of exaltation . &nbsp; DRUMMOND ( off-screen ) Well !

Dr. Schaefer , it seems , had arranged an assignation with a girl from the hematology lab named Sheila . ACROSS Drummond to the now empty other bed . All the lights are on . PAN on Nurse Penny Canduso and an orderly wheeling away the wrapped body of Guernsey . Intern Schaefer , at the door , considers the empty bed with interest . Moving to the bedtable , he picks up the receiver of the phone . &nbsp; SCHAEFER ( on phone ) Hey Sheila , this is Howard , Sheila . Hey listen , I got us a bed for tonight .

The hospital was to do all the killing for me . All I need do was arrange for the doctors to become patients in their own hospital . Accordingly , the next morning , I set out for Dr. Ives . I put on Dr. Schaefer 's uniform , pinched some digoxine from the pharmacy and a sandbag from a utility cart , and found my way to Dr. Ives ' laboratory . I coshed him with the sandbag , gave him a massive shot of the digoxine . This , you see , brought on an instant condition of cardiac arrhythmia .
