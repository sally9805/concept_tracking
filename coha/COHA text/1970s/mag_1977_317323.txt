From New York Bureau Chief Laurence Barrett : <P> On frigid Fulton Street , the dilapidated main drag of Brooklyn 's black Bedford-Stuyvesant ghetto , idle young men were warming their hands at trash-barrel fires and talking about their future . Life is bleak even in the best of times for people on Fulton Street , where hustling and mugging are commonplace . It has been even worse lately because of New York City 's empty coffers and the continued loss of factory jobs to other parts of the country . Nonetheless , Jimmy Carter 's election has brought a measure of wary optimism . Explained Community Worker Eduardo Standard : " They expect him to pay more attention to jobs . Does n't matter whether it 's private jobs or public jobs , just so long as it 's work . As we say here , when you 're sitting on a hot furnace , there 's no place to go but up . " <P> The plight of Bed-Stuy is extreme but easily recognizable to any big-city mayor in the region . After trimming its payroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City must make additional cuts to meet Mayor Abraham Beame 's promise of a balanced budget by June 30 , 1978 . New York Governor Hugh Carey this week will announce details of a further squeeze in public services to keep the state solvent . <P> Most parts of the Middle Atlantic region have had to grow accustomed to the hard realities of economic stagnation , which set in before the national recession and is likely to survive it . In Philadelphia , Buffalo , Newark and even the affluent suburbs , talk soon turns to unemployment . There are jobs to be had , as any newspaper 's want ads demonstrate , but only about half as many as were offered ten years ago . One reason that many of the jobs are going begging is that some unemployed people can afford to be choosy about work . For instance , in New York , dishwashing at the minimum wage of $2.30 per hr. pays less than the unemployment compensation ( $95 a week ) available to a skilled worker who is out of a job . But according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important reason is that most advertised jobs require some skills , and high schools " do n't train enough people for work that is available . " <P> Whatever the answer is to these problems , Easterners have a sense that Washington under Carter will be more interested in finding it . For starters , they applaud his proposals to stimulate the economy by tax cuts and other means . <P> There are other encouraging signs for the East . Pittsburgh has been buoyed by predictions of a good year for steel , and New York City by the Ford Administration 's approval of $1 billion to replace the crumbling West Side Highway with a six-lane interstate Westway . <P> Yet few people expect all the solutions to come from Washington . Said Roscoe Brown Jr. , director of New York University 's Institute of Afro-American Affairs : " More and more people realize that we have to help ourselves . Local groups are getting together to do things in neighborhoods-fighting crime , getting baseball teams going , raising money for hospitals and libraries . That sort of thing is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations from Carter , expressions of enthusiasm-or even keen interest-are rare . Many middle-class people seem more preoccupied with the latest fads :
