txt THE LAST WORDS sung by the Collins Sigh School mixed chorus hung gently on the mind as the young people left the Board of Education meeting room . . heavenly peace . " But peace was not at band Wednesday , not for the board members who finally found out what their financial condition is and heard it is almost terminal ; not for protesters led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson , who almost got arrested ; not for the school children of Chicago , who had better hope Santa arrived on his sleigh with about half a billion dollars to keep their schools open . As the door dosed after the chorus , an observer mumbled : " Back to the fighting , folks .

" APPARENTLY MY color was wrong , " the woman said . " I 'm not going to take that , " Mrs. Preston said . The mood of the crowd was getting quite testy when a speaker yielded his alloted two minute time to the Rev. Mr. Jackson . He began to speak , talking of " steamroller decisions , " " racism , " and the " politics of race . " At the end of the two minutes , Mrs. Rader said his time was up . The reverend kept speaking .

" You are out of order . You mut Mrs. Byrne . " Mrs. Roder asked for the next speaker . Everyone yielded to the Rev.

" Chicago is a classic example of a colonial power , " said the Rev. George Beddick , an aide at Operation Push People United to Save Humanity . " Blacks and browns have been locked out of whole school crisis . " THE SPEECH ENDED . The reverend asked if there were any questions . Mrs. Rohter ignored hint . " You wo n't deal with him because he 's a black man , " a woman in the audience shouted . The reverend asked , again .

Mr. Jackson began leading the protesters in a prayer . Mrs. Rohter consulted with the police . People milled around .. MRS . ROSTER continued with the meeting . Somehow a speaker got through to the microphone . " I am here as the parent of a handicapped child , " she said quietly as bedlam threatened to reign around her . A few voices were raised in " We shall overcome . " The reverend kept praying , ending with " The Lord 's Prayer . " A white spectator bellowed : " Madame Chairman , I want order .

" I 'm ' going to the bathroom , " he whispered . Then , it was time for the bad news . Jerome Van Gorkom. the businessman named ? to head a committee to watch over school finances , gave it to them . They took it meekly , rather like school children being addressed by a teacher . Van Gorkom explained , slowly and pa-. tiently , just how the board had managed to come to the brink . of financial disaster . He even used a blackboard .

Board members asked questions . " How are you going to help us ? " Mrs. Preston asked . " I do not come with a solution to your problems , " Van Gorkom said . But he indicated one very real solution might be " to live within your income . " HE SUMMED UP the situation : " It 's not serious . It 's desperate . " A board member asked why the financial community had not diagnosed the board 's financial condition and warned someone . Several observers choked in amazement . They had assumed it was the board 's duty to know its own condition . During a recess , Van Gorkom talked to reporters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much about them , " he said . Then it was the accountants ' turn . Their job is figures , not kids . " Ninety four million . . . " they intoned . " One hundred thirty one million . . . 649 million . . . "
