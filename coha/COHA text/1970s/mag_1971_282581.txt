Under the eye of television cameras , the heads of three leading European banks took their places on gilded Louis XV chairs at an oblong marble table in an 18th century Baroque palace . Each man in turn signed a document . Then the trio toasted the occasion in Mot &; Chandon champagne-as well they might . Credit Lyonnais of France , Commerzbank of Germany and Banco di Roma of Italy had just joined in a unique accord that one executive described as having " all the advantages of a merger without its inconveniences . " The signing brought into being a financial powerhouse with $18 billion in deposits , 3,000 branches and 60,000 employees , making it the largest banking operation in Europe and the fourth largest in the world. * Though there will be no common direction , the three partners intend to " harmonize " management practices and so integrate their accounts that a customer will be able to walk into a Crdit Lyonnais branch in Marseilles and make a deposit to his Banco di Roma account in Milan . <P> Mnage a Trois . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mating .

The multinational trend has built up a momentum of its own . Says Dr. Heinz Sippel , a Westdeutsche Landesbank representative at Orion : " There were a number of trains standing in the station , and we wanted to be sure to get aboard one of them before they all pulled out .
