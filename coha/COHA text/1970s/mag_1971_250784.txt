I think we 've gone hog wild in putting all our hopes on White House leadership . We have to develop other sources of drive and imagination . This is a time of interlocking revolutions . There is a very serious question as to whether our institutions can hold together under the enormous strains of those changes . Somebody has to make them work . <P> - John Gardner <P> One year ago , the former Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare left the relative calm of the Urban Coalition to try an experiment in making American institutions work . John Gardner 's notion was to create a citizens ' superlobby called Common Cause ; his dream has come true-sort of . <P> Common Cause claims a membership of 191,000 , paying a minimum of $15 per person per annum . Gardner 's liberal and determinedly nonpartisan " third force " has a projected budget for its second year of $3,800,000 , of which roughly a third is earmarked for membership expansion . Aided by word-of-mouth recruitment , which already accounts for 25% of the organization 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by next year . They could also shrink , and in that sense Common Cause faces a continued test . Says Gardner : " Our record is fairly well known now . A year ago , a membership prospect got a blueprint . Now he gets a track record . " <P> Mailing List . Trouble is , that record is not as clear and sharp as it might be . To be sure , the effectiveness of lobbying defies precise calculation . Common Cause has concentrated most of its efforts on Congress , and new legislation has many fathers . Still , Gardner feels that Common Cause should be recognized for significant if sometimes intangible achievements . <P> Common Cause claims success for its efforts in behalf of the 18-year-old vote ; the group sparked a heavy write-in campaign , lobbied on Capitol Hill and organized ratification coalitions and lobbies in many state capitols . Though Gardner asks for no special credit , Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin commended Common Cause for its help " in rallying opposition to the SST and winning the fight . " <P> Gardner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Committee 's newsletter " Monday " as " a purveyor of the radical Democratic line on virtually every issue . " Gardner once had to apologize for a staff goof that permitted the Democratic National Committee to use his mailing list for fund raising . He has been vulnerable on another count : Lyn Nofziger of the Republican National Committee has charged him with creating a personality cult . That accusation is undoubtedly unfair . But it is true that John Gardner 's personal prestige and organizational skill have been essential in attracting supporters to Common Cause . While he persuasively disclaims personal political ambitions , there is continued speculation that he might emerge as a sort of citizens ' candidate for the presidency . In the forthcoming election , Gardner does not want Common Cause to endorse any candidate but to act as a kind of conscience . Says he : " You are going to get two candidates who are completely accommodated to a set of institutions that need to be renovated . Somebody has to have his eye on that .
