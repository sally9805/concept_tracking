Inevitable as Autumn Here is a melancholy little love story , carefully crafted , that evokes the kind of mood more ambitious projects only hint at . Made in Europe on a slender budget by Screenwriter James Salter ( Downhill Racer ) , Three says more about young love in a single scene than Last Summer , for example , does in its entire running time . <P> Salter , working from an Irwin Shaw short story , has kept the plot simple , concentrating on nuance of character and atmosphere . Taylor ( Sam Waterston ) and Bert ( Robie Porter ) are two decidedly American college boys touring Europe during the summer in a beat-up Peugeot . One morning in Florence 's Piazza della Signoria , Taylor meets a bored and footloose English girl named Marty ( Charlotte Rampling ) who is alone on holiday and obviously receptive to some attractive company . She takes the boys to visit some jaded Italian friends ; they respond by inviting her along on the remainder of their trip . <P> It is all Taylor 's idea . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , " he says , " with the understanding that she does n't choose between us . " Bert agrees , but it is a compact made to be broken . Taylor , longingly in love with Marty , clings to his word ; he can not bring himself to violate the agreement and " ruin the beautiful summer " by sleeping with her . Bert has no such scruples . The result is as inevitable as autumn . <P> Such a fragile theme could easily have been ground into pulp , but Salter is a film maker of discretion . He includes too many scenes of motoring and picnicking , but he has a laconic facility with dialogue and an eye for the small gesture that can transform a scene from an actor 's project into reality . Sam Waterston is a superb young naturalistic performer , Robie Porter is convincing and human in an unsympathetic role , and Charlotte Rampling , all angles and sensuality , is that rare thing , a beautiful woman who can also fairly be called an actress .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
