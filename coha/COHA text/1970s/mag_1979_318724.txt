Asking the question again <P> On a visit to Boston , Senator Ted Kennedy was cornered by a local television reporter . With mike in hand , she dutifully asked the question , and Kennedy coolly responded with the answer . Yes , he had every expectation that President Carter would be renominated , he said , and yes , he fully intended to support him . The reporter was disappointed . " I 've heard that answer before , " she groused off-camera . " Oh , uh , that 's all right , " smiled Kennedy , " I , uh , T 've heard the question before too . " <P> So he has . And , as Reporter James Wooten points out in a recent cover story in the Washington Post magazine recalling that unsuccessful interrogation , both the question and the Senator 's coy answer will be analyzed countless more times . The punditry should reach a crest this week as journalists almost everywhere take yet another look at Kennedy and his intentions . The reason for the outpouring : it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the bridge at Chappaquiddick , next to Martha 's Vineyard , and a young female aide drowned . <P> On the eve of the anniversary , all three networks were preparing Kennedy stories , as were the two major wire services , the New York Times , the Philadelphia Inquirer , the Gannett newspapers and many others .

Why not take him at his word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are beginning to hit the brakes on covering every Kennedy tease . Says Executive Producer Av Westin of ABC 's World News : " We do n't want to end up giving him a free campaign ride . " <P> Kennedy , to be sure , generates plenty of copy with his energetic Senate activities . But at times it almost seems as if the press wants to build up Kennedy as a presidential prospect because that would make covering the nominating process far more interesting . Says Washington Post Ombudsman Charles Seib : " If there is n't a fight , we 'll make one . " <P> Many reporters are sensitive to suggestions that they are not tough enough on Kennedy . But it is no easier for journalists to get angry with Teddy than it was for them to get angry with Brothers Jack and Bobby . Explains James Weighart , Washington bureau chief for the New York Daily News : " He 's such a likable guy . He 's responsive ... You smoke cigars together . You kid together .
