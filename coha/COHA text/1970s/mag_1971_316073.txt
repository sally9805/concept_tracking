SOUTHERN history books , says our Atlanta bureau chief , Joseph Kane , contain many references to dastardly " Yankee journalists " who went South to feed on the carcass of the vanquished Confederacy . The antipathy has lingered into modern times . But in reporting for this week 's cover story on the new South and Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter , Kane found as one sign of evolution a moderating attitude toward the press : " Even the courthouse gangs that run local politics are becoming more tolerant of itinerant reporters . " <P> The TIME cover staffers , however , could not have been considered carpetbaggers even in the old days . Rather they lived in Dixie through its years of great change . Kane grew up in Washington , D.C. , while it was " still very much a Southern town , " he recalls . " When my high school eventually took its first black student , the football team had to travel to Pennsylvania and even West Virginia to play .

Phillips recalls that trucks used to oil the dirt road in front of her house to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to remember . They consisted of only two digits . " At age eleven , she tried cotton picking : " I can still feel the burlap bag cutting into my shoulder . " Twelve years later she dropped out of the University of Georgia to work for the Atlanta Constitution , joined the Washington Post in 1968 . She frequently covered civil rights stories while a reporter and has kept up with the field since joining TIME last July . <P> Although she remained in New York during the story 's preparation , Phillips did not feel deprived of identification with the subject matter . " The longer I live in Manhattan , " she says , " the more Southern I become . "
