HABEAS CORPUS <P> by ALAN BENNETT <P> Can even a farce rest only on a pair of falsies ? It is true that in the course of Habeas Corpus ( which means , appropriately , let 's have the body ) a couple of sets of real female breasts are fondled and pummeled , and one or two actors lose their trousers , but the evening 's focus is on a pair of " the Rubens , made of sensitized Fablon as used on Apollo space missions . " The breastworks are delivered to one Connie Wicksteed , who looks so like a choirboy that the errant local curate has fallen in love with her . Connie lives in the genteel resort town of Hove with her brother Arthur , a G.P. specializing in lechery , his wife Muriel , a lady endowed with Jane Russell proportions , and a cleaning woman who is a victim of overexposure to modern communication : " I 'm now going into the lotus position .

" <P> What follows is entirely predictable and unabashedly vulgar . Inhibitions must be left at the door . Alan Bennett , one of the quartet of Beyond the Fringe a decade ago , has constructed no more than a sloppy farce , but in Director Frank Dunlop 's nimble hands it becomes an uproarious kaleidoscope of pratfalls . The Wicksteeds live in a world still superficially Victorian , but underneath there rage fires of frustration fed by the characters ' anxiety that if an opportunity arises , their sexual equipment may be unequal to the occasion . Thus every double-entendre is not merely dirty but wistful . The cast acts as if high on speed . Two are supreme . Donald Sinden turns Arthur into an irresistible hypocrite whose mind is so firmly fixed on sex that everything else is tiresome distraction , while Rachel Roberts ' surrender of Muriel 's well-bred faade to exigent desire fills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . <P> Gina Mallet
