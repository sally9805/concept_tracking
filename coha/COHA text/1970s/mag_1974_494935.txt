religion . The book is also useful . Somewhere in these essays is just about everything the traveler needs to know : bits and pieces about African food and hotels ( " touristic violence " Moravia calls it ) ; astute comments on Africa 's people ( including the Asian minorities and the last of the colons ) ; sad , but true , statements about the rape of Africa 's wildlife ? all described with a sharp cutting edge , in a good translation by Angus Davidson . One quotation will suffice . Of the Hotel Ivoire in Abidjan ( that haven for thousands of European travelers , complete with multiple swimming pools and an ice-skating rink ) , Moravia says : The hotel has no relationship with Africa ; it has a relationship only with the West of which it is both an emanation and an outpost . It takes five hours to fly from'Paris to the hotel ; but it is often impossible to reach villages not more than about a hundred kilometres from Abidjan .

I used to think that the most important book one could read for a general overview of life in Africa today was Colin Tumbull 's The Lonely African ( 1962 ) . Now there are two books ? Tumbull 's and Moravia 's . These days it is not very easy for a white man to say something intelligent about Africa . Charles R. Larson CHARLES R.

Fine Print Richards and Etcetera Doris Grumbach Published last year and recommended to me by a reviewer who had been struck by its photographic force and eloquence , Few Comforts or Surprises ( MU Press ; $9.95 , $7.95 paper ) is a book no one can open and then shut quickly or , having once become engaged with it , will be able to put out of mind .

He has shown us a vision of life so tragic and hopeless that other places one may have seen or seen photographed pall before it . The narrative , which forms only a small part of this chronicle of spiritual imprisonment , tries hard to accompany the incredible photographs , but fails perhaps because the written word lacks the innate power of the picture , but more because Richards ' style is often awkward and strained , attempting a poeticism it can not possibly reach . But no matter . The photographs are so full of poignant detail , so unsentimental and cold-eyed , and yet , despite the fact that this lens has no tint to it , so full of compassion for the subjects and their ugly environment , that the book takes on a pulsing , exhausting life of its own .

Etcetera : One of the bashes that literary editors , reviewers and , I 'm sure , publicists and judges looked forward to every year was the National Book Award doings in New York . Publishers ' parties were lavish and there was a modicum of meetings to attend , just enough to justify all the eating and drinking and socializing . Well in these days of publishers ' tightened belts and budgets , the National Book Committee ( now 20 years old ) has decided ( rightly , I think ) to disband . The 1975 awards will be made in April , but there are no plans for the usual ceremonies and celebrations of the awards . The winners will , presumably , pocket their thousand dollars and their consequent royalties , and creep quietly , undined and unwined , all the way to the bank .
