COME NINEVEH , COME TYRE <P> by ALLEN DRURY <P> 481 pages . Doubleday . $8.95 . <P> Long ago , in the sane dull Washington of 1958 , Journalist Allen Drury wrote his first novel-the one for which he is remembered-Advise and Consent . That was a blowsy , likable , jump-all-over-you book , about a Senate battle against confirmation of a Secretary of State ; about a band of stalwart lawmakers , including one Senator being blackmailed for homosexuality ; about a society hostess , and so on . It made a great read . It won Drury the Pulitzer Prize , which he even perhaps deserved : he had had the energy to people a big novel with a lot of boldly drawn characters and keep them moving through incidents and operatic set pieces . Beyond that , he was a man of sense and rugged principle-though his heroes all seemed to employ the same turgid speechwriter . <P> Then history began to play tricks on Allen Drury .

But these days no writer should play " Can You Top This ? " with history . <P> Come Nineveh , Come Tyre is the fifth and penultimate novel in what the author calls the Advise and Consent series . Escalation has continued . Nothing less than the destruction of the American republic , and its transformation into a totalitarian dictatorship , is this book 's story . It includes the assassination of a presidential candidate , the suicides of a President and a Vice President , and an incipient bloodless takeover of the U.S. by Russia . Drury 's political principles have hardened into sclerotic pieties . Few would argue that the Soviet Union could never be tempted into acting out her ancient ambitions , or that U.S. military strength and civil concord are not important to keeping the peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in February-and history , that heartless bitch , has stood him up again , with the Watergate investigations and the Agnew scandal . Characters more fascinating , events more crowded , a conspiracy against the Constitution far more plausible than any thing Drury has invented . It is not Drury 's country that is a helpless giant , after all . It is his novel . <P> Horace Judson
