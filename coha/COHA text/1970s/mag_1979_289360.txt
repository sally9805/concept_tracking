" I spent most of my time reading . Lefortovo had a wonderful library-it looked as if all the books confiscated from the enemies of the people over half a century had ended up here . Up and down the country they had ' purged ' libraries and burned ' pernicious ' books , while in here , everything was preserved as in an oasis . It had never occurred to anyone to purge the libraries of the KGB prisons-who could be holier than the pope ? Pre-revolutionary editions of Pushkin and Gogol , A.K. Tolstoy and Lermontov , Hamsun and Maeterlinck , Marcel Proust and Zamyatin . What did n't they have in here ? <P> The books were in excellent condition , but almost all their pages were covered with rubber stamps . ' Internal prison of the GUGB NKVD ' was a prewar stamp . ' Investigation isolator of the KGB under the SM of the U.S.S.R. was a modern stamp . And in capital letters running from top to bottom of the entire page : ' Any damage done to books or marking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will result in the withdrawal of library privileges .
