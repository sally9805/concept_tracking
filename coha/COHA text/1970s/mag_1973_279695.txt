In Paris last week , Surgeon Georges Thomeret talked to reporters and displayed a photograph of a dead woman . " She was 24 years old , married , and had a child of two . She had an abortion , done by her concierge . Voila : dead of septicemia blood poisoning because she could not afford $500 for a safe abortion in England . That is why I signed the manifesto , because of this woman and others like her . " <P> The manifesto , issued last week and signed by 390 French doctors , makes bold demands on a nation that has successfully resisted even moderate abortion reform for half a century ; it calls for unrestricted abortion on request - and at the expense of the state . Many of the signers are prominent in medicine and some are practicing Catholics . All , moreover , acknowledge that they have performed or arranged abortions because " we believe it is our duty to help women . " The doctors realize that their admission makes them liable to punishment under France 's archaic law prohibiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are undeterred . " We will stand trial together , " they proclaim defiantly . <P> Two days after the manifesto appeared , 206 well-known French citizens - including four Nobel prizewinners - added their voices to the demand for reform . They issued a " charter " calling for abortion on several grounds , among them poor health , rape , incest and " grave social conditions . " <P> Appearing only four weeks before the sharply contested national elections , the manifesto and charter have provoked bitter controversy across France . For the first time since the present abortion law was passed in 1920 , chances for reform seem good . <P> The Gaullist government is not expected to buy the idea of liberalization without a fight . A few years ago a committee of the Public Health Ministry insisted that " the state can never legalize abortion . " Government officials and their supporters , still of the same mind , at first did not respond to last week 's declarations , hoping to forestall debate . They feared that inflamed public opinion could force a change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midweek , however , the newspapers were so full of the controversy that silence became impossible . Public Health Minister Jean Foyer spoke out , calling the manifesto " excessive " and charging the reformers with political maneuvering and provocation . <P> A more positive response came , surprisingly , from a Gaullist Deputy , Jacques Sourdille of the Ardennes region , who announced that he would soon introduce a liberal abortion bill in the National Assembly . The fate of that measure depends partly on the election outcome . If the Gaullists are defeated , the bill-or a similar one-is almost certain to pass . If they win , Sourdille 's permissive bill may be defeated , but public opinion is nevertheless expected to force at least some degree of reform . <P> The prospects for liberalization have been further enhanced by two recent events : the U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing abortion on demand , and the case of Marie-Claire Chevalier , 15 , who was arrested and tried in Paris because she had had an abortion after being raped ( she was acquitted , but her mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
