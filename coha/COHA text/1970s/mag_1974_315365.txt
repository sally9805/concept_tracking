For nearly a decade , Japan and the Soviet Union have been mired in desultory negotiations over joint development of the vast natural resources of Siberia . The Japanese need the oil , natural gas , coal and timber that the Russians offer and have plenty of hard currency to invest in extracting it . The Soviets need the cash , and Russian leaders from the time of the czars have been eager to develop that frozen wilderness . But the two parties have differed on just about every detail , from interest rates to what should be developed first . <P> Last week the odd couple finally agreed to agree-maybe . Japan will lend $1.05 billion to the Soviet Union so that work can begin on three major projects : mining coal in southern Yakutia , prospecting for natural gas in northern Yakutia , and harvesting timber in the Soviet Far East . The Russians will repay the loan in hard currency at 6.375% interest over the next 16 years . Four-fifths of the loan must be used by the Soviets to purchase Japanese mining and lumbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union will supply Japan with coal at prevailing world market prices and timber and natural gas . <P> As that description might indicate , Japan 's future in Siberia is still so uncertain that many diplomats wonder if last week 's deal will come off at all . As recently as this month an agreement looked more unlikely than ever . The Japanese have stipulated that two interested U.S. firms , Occidental Petroleum and El Paso Natural Gas , be brought into the gas exploration venture because of their expertise in that activity , and that the U.S. put up an equal amount of money for the venture . The Soviets are amenable , but Congress lately has been opposed to granting the Export-Import Bank credits necessary for U.S. participation . Some legislators object to Soviet treatment of dissident intellectuals and Jews ; others feel that the money would be better spent inside the U.S. In addition , the idea of lending billions of dollars to the Soviets at low interest when American businessmen must pay 10% or more on bank loans is politically unattractive , to put it mildly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviets last month abandoned their plan for an east-Siberian oil and gas pipeline and instead plan a railroad that would run roughly parallel to the Chinese border some 250 to 300 miles inside Soviet territory . Among other things , it would carry Siberian oil to ports for export to Japan . The Chinese are probably worried by the idea of a railroad , which also could be used to carry troops and arms . Japanese relations with China have been improving recently , and Premier Kakuei Tanaka is unlikely to do anything to jeopardize that budding friendship . <P> Mired in Mud . Japanese and Soviet representatives have until September to work out final details on the three ventures . Late last week the coal project was settled , and early agreement on the timber venture appeared likely . But everything hinges on getting the gas deal , with U.S. participation , sewed up too . If that can be done , the Soviets could start receiving Japanese mining and foresting machinery by September . Siberian timber could start moving to Japan as early as this fall , coal by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earliest . If the September deadline is not met , the loan will not be made , and Japanese-Soviet economic cooperation will still be mired in Siberian mud .
