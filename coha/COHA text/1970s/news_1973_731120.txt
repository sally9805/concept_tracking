txt The pressure for impeachment proceedings is intensifying as top Republicans call upon the House to vote the question up or down as soon as possible . Now Melvin R. Laird joins Vice-President Gerald Ford and Sen. Barry Goldwater in pushing for this early decision . He asks that the House decide by March 15 whether it will impeach the President . The objective of these Republicans is not , of course , to bring about impeachment of Mr. Nixon . Instead , they are taking the position that there will not be sufficient votes in the House for an impeachment which would amount to an indictment . // *Laird : Decide on Nixon // What tney are admitting , however , some say , is something particularly significant They are saying the President needs to restore public trust , and that nothing less than an absolving vote in the House will be able to restore this credibility . Implicit , too , in that position is an acknowledgement that the President 's efforts to clear up Watergate have failed , including his recent " Operation Candor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of an announcement that he was leaving his post as counselor to the President on Feb. 1 , said that a prompt impeachment vote was necessary " because the continuing controversy over Watergate and other issues is hurting America 's foreign and domestic policies . " Actually , it was George D. Aiken of Vermont who was the first Republican Senator to urge impeachment as a means of letting the President put Watergate behind him . Mr. Laird , who says he is a " good counter , " thinks that a House impeachment vote would fall short of the majority needed for such an indictment . If the House voted for impeachment , then the decision on conviction ( two-thirds necessary to convict ) would ensue in the Senate . President Andrew Johnson was impeached . But the Senate conviction vote fell a vote short . Ironical position Republican leadership now finds itself in the rather ironical position of calling for quick impeachment proceedings while at the same time criticizing the Democrats for letting their feet drag on the issue . They think the Democrats now want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and on . They judge the Democratic timing for moving toward an impeachment vote will be sometime near the 1974 elections . The Repbulicans are hopeful the President can clear his skirts quickly and , thereby , help to lift , at least in part , the Watergate load from the shoulders of Republican candidates who will be running for office next Year . In asking for quick action on impeachment , Mr Laird said : " I would call on my former colleagues in the House ? Democrats and Republicans alike ? to accept their constitutional responsibility " and vote on the issue . April target " There 's no reason , " said Mr. Laird , " why the House ca n't pass judgment in the next 60 days . " Mr. Laird told a White House news briefing of his decision to leave Mr. Nixon 's staff after seven months as the President 's chief domestic counselor , the Associated Press reported . " I do n't have disappointments " in departing to become senior counselor for national and international affairs of the Reader 's Digest Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Nixon had failed to heed his political advice . The Wisconsin Republican who served nine terms in Congress , said the new Vice-President , Gerald Ford , can take over his congressional liaison and domestic adviser duties . In a letter of response , President Nixon thanked Mr. Laird for postponing his departure for a month until Feb. 1 to help prepare the State of the Union and budget messages .
