The conventional beginning to an interest in nature and conservation is the picture of a small tousle-haired boy roaming the country lanes and fields , pockets crawling with insects and small reptiles . Dedicated to animals from an early age , a despair to tidy-minded parents and teachers , dirty , absentminded and frequently truant , the budding naturalist scrapes unwillingly through school and college . Forty years later , the picture of the early days of the distinguished naturalist becomes even more romantic and embellished with prophetic details . I am not a distinguished naturalist ; in fact , I 'm not really a naturalist at all . I have merely developed or acquired an interest in conservation . Far from having a passion for spiders and toads as a small boy , I can remember not the faintest interest in them or anything else to do with " nature , " for that matter . To me the world was there ; I accepted it . Wild animals were as much a part of the scenery as railway trains or street lamps . It 's true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gardener , but very soon their breeding ability defeated our combined efforts at birth control and the swarming colony was quietly disposed of . I do n't remember even shedding a tear . I think I was fortunate in being born into a very matter-of-fact family . There was no sloppy sentimentality about " darling furry creatures " or " our feathered friends " and no anthropomorphic attachment to dogs or other pets . Animals were simply animals to be treated with consideration , but not with gushing adoration . I suppose that living partly in the country , frequently in large family houses , surrounded by pets of all kinds and being on fairly intimate terms with the usual farm animals , I never consciously segregated human from animal existence ! Anyway , I made my way through school totally oblivious of the call of nature or whatever it is that captures the imagination of the budding naturalist . Even a fairly elementary course in biology failed to arouse any enthusiasm and the internal arrangements of a frog left me cold . Stalking roe deer and red deer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of many of my relations that it has never become a moral problem as far as I am concerned , although I realize it can raise strong emotions in others . The sight of blood had nothing of the mystical significance which it seems to hold for those who grow up shielded from the facts of life . But I very soon learned the basic rules and traditions of those who for generations have gone after game animals and birds : the rigid observance of close seasons , the need for special care in hard weather , the overriding concern to avoid unnecessary suffering , and the need to understand the whole life cycle and habits of particular game animals and their predators . I certainly learned the fundamental lesson of conservation that if you want any game animals the following year you have to ensure a proper breeding stock and a suitable habitat . Looking back now , I realize that this was my real introduction to natural history , and it does n't surprise me to find how many amateur naturalists came into it through shooting , stalking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ townspeople seem to be incapable of understanding that hunting and conservation are now entirely compatible so far as con- . // servation is concerned . They simply will not , or do not wish to recognize that in most parts of the world the leadership in conservation has come from experienced hunting sportsmen . This early introduction was brought to a rather sudden halt when 1 joined the Navy in 1939 , just in time to be swept into six years of war . Again , if I had had any particular interest in nature I would be able to record that I had kept notes of observations of seabirds during those days . In fact , I have to admit that I do n't consciously remember seeing any birds at all in the whole period I spent at sea in the North Sea , Indian Ocean and Pacific . To the sailor there are anyway only three types of birds : sparrows , seagulls and ducks  --  but I have omitted the traditional descriptive adjectives . Discovery , in the sense that I became aware of the fact that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game birds , came rather slowly , and then only because I had bought a rather expensive camera and a telescopic lens . In 1956 I went to Melbourne in the Royal Yacht Britannia for the Olympic Games . Following a short visit to New Zealand , we sailed across the Pacific Ocean to visit what were then called the Bases of the Falkland Islands Dependencies on the Grahamland Peninsula of the Antarctic Continent . From the Chatham Islands off the coast of New Zealand to Grahamland is 3,800 miles of open sea in the roaring forties . The old windjammers used that route across the South Pacific from Australia round Cape Horn to England . They crashed across , driven by a succession of depressions which caught them in a series of westerly gales . The passage took us 13 days , and by a stroke of luck we picked a gap between two depressions and crossed in relative comfort . We soon got used to the long , heaving swell but our only company were the seabirds of the southern oceans . Simply as a pastime I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then on I was hooked . I had to know what each species was called . I had to try and get a reasonable picture of every species that came anywhere near the yacht , and in no time at all I had exposed the first of several miles of film and started a hobby and an interest which has grown with the years . Other journeys followed , to Africa for independence ceremonies , the Galapagos , Iceland , South America , Canada and Australia , and most recently to Ethiopia . Each time , I must confess , the planning included some provision to do a bit of bird watching and sometimes some photography . Even if a proper expedition were not possible , I soon discovered that the grounds and gardens of Government Houses invariably held a store of new and fascinating birds . In Canada I managed to squeeze a few days out of a busy program to escape into the Laurentians , and I returned with eyes red-rimmed by binoculars and a well-thumbed copy of Roger Tory Peterson 's Field Guide to Birds . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serengeti National Park with some friends and we were able to add half a dozen names to the Park 's checklist of birds . It was there that I came across my favorite bird name , the " Barefaced Go Away Bird . " If you do n't believe it , look it up . In Iceland it was the famous Lake Myvatn and in Kenya the remote and fascinating Lake Rudolf . In Australia I gave the citizens of Perth a faint shock by getting up before dawn to watch and photograph birds on the Swan River . In Canberra I again got away before dawn on the day of the capital 's 50th birthday celebrations to watch some mist settling on the shores of Lake George . If I was n't all ears and appreciation at the speeches and ceremonies later that day , this supplies the explanation . In South America bird watching is almost too much of a good thing ; everywhere there is something new to be seen , and expeditions with knowledgeable ornithologists such as I managed in Chile and Argentina produced an indigestion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my contact with the natural environment took place away from home . In fact , not many years after the war a combination of fortunate circumstances made it possible for me to resume some of the country pursuits . Indeed , one thing led to another . It is quite impossible to spend a day on a Scottish river or loch , or up on the high hills , and fail to notice the life of birds and other animals . One day it might be the dramatic sight of a golden eagle floating watchfully over the heather , or perhaps a wild cat or fox about its business , golden plover , ptarmigan , black cock or perhaps an adder just a bit too close for comfort ; on the river it might be an otter or the screaming oyster catcher or the silent , flitting flight of the dipper or some small wader . It is the incidental happenings of a dawn or dusk wildfowling expedition to some remote marsh in East Anglia which make the whole experience so fascinating . The sights and sounds and the mysterious movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Without an interest in these pursuits I would never have seen the Norfolk Broads in the grip of an icy winter , or watched the dawn come up over the St. Lawrence marshes , or witnessed the spectacular collections of wildfowl in the swamps of India , Pakistan , Persia and Greece . In fact , I have been wet and frozen , and fried in the sun . I have walked for miles through fields and over hills ; I have frightened myself silly climbing to the top of rickety pigeon platforms , and I have sat shivering on the edge of a kale field in a blizzard . I once sat in what North Americans call a " blind " with a chap who prided himself on being able to call duck . Unfortunately , he was just getting over an attack of whooping cough . Every time he started to quack it brought on a bout of whooping . To anyone with a conventional view of pleasure , to the town-living , comfort-loving commuter , the idea that there might be any thrill in wildfowling or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet this is the stuff of natural history , this is a certain way to arouse an enthusiasm for conservation . Without this introduction I would never have learned about the sights and sounds of the country and the wilderness or taken my camera to places like Hilbre Island , off the northwest coast of England , the nature reserves in the Outer Hebrides , or to Lake Rudolf . Perhaps the most fascinating expedition of all was a four-day visit to the Galapagos Islands , forever associated with Darwin 's great work , the Mecca of naturalists and a veritable paradise for bird and animal photographers . It is here above all that the whole problem of conservation becomes most obvious . I came to conservation through shooting and bird watching , but that is only a very limited sector of natural history . Others arrive at the dilemma of conservation through animals and zoology , or through a delight in flowers and botany , or through the study and practice of forestry , or again through fish and marine biology . Sooner or later , it becomes only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the whole . It is only a matter of a short time of innocent bird watching and photography before the question of survival of species begins to dawn on the mind . It was made to dawn on my mind pretty forcefully when I agreed to attend and speak at the inauguration of the United States World Wildlife Fund National Appeal in New York in 1962 . There is nothing like having to make a
