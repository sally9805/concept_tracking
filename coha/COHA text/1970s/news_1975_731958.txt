txt President Ford , asserting that a federally guaranteed loan to New York City " would provide no real solution , " tonight turned down the city 's plea for the $1.5-billion in cash it says it , needs for its expenses through June 30 . In a letter that began " Dear Abe , " read by an aide over the telephone to Mayor Beame and Governor Carey as they attended the Democratic dinner tonight at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and released by the White House shortly before 9 P.M. , the President said : " I believe that the proper place for any requests for backing and guarantee is to the State of New York . " Despite the President 's decision , Congressional leaders said they would continue to work for some kind of Federal loan guarantee or bond purchase by the Federal Reserve System to help the city avoid having to sell additional securities in an increasingly reluctant commercial money market . But they conditioned support on economies by the city and aid from the state and banks . Mr. Beame has said repeatedly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford Rejects a Plea by Beame for Help anteed by a Congressional bill authorizing the Treasury to make it , would merely have postponed the city 's problem for the requested 90 days . Mr. Simon said later that he , Mr. Ford and the President 's domestic advisers had considered three options . Advancing Medicaid payments and revenue-sharing money was the first , he said , and would have given New York about $200-million . But Mr. Simon said " this was not a viable option " and would have " set a dangerous precedent . " The second option under which the Federal Government would have sought legislation to permit the Treasury to either buy city notes outright or to guarantee their purchase " was again a precedent . " ? In response to questioning , was reasonable . " hc- : said that he believed that the city could avoid default and , even if it could not , he doubted whether such an event would affect other money markets . Mr. Carey several times on Tuesday warned that a money failure in New York would he disastrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a . circumstance the Federal Reserve System . " the lender of last resort , would carry out their traditional role if , indeed , there was a problem . " Asked if he meant that the possibility of a direct loan to the city was then possible , Mr. Simon said that he meant money would go in through the commercial banks . " There is no doubt that Mayor Beame inherited some of his problems or that he is taking laudable steps , " but more must be taken , Mr. Simon said . Tonight 's denial followed a day of political maneuvering with the city 's fiscal problems at the core . The New York Congressional delegation in a meeting with House Speaker Carl Albert echoed Mr. Simon and let it be known that any hope for Federal financial aid to the city , either short-term or long , was dependent upon the city 's instituting a series of economics and receiving additional state aid . In addition , those at the meeting suggested that the city press the banks to market its note issues . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the President 's Domestic Council , and his deputy , Richard L. Dunham , and approved earlier in the evening by Mr. Ford between the sessions with the National Secucity Council and with the Congressional leadership on the shifting Cambodian situation . It was Mr. Cannon who read the letter to Mayor Beame in New York . Immediately following the release of the text of the letter , Treasury Secretary William E. Simon , who had said last week that the Federal Government would not be the source of help for the city , declared that Mr. Ford 's response to New York should be regarded as a signal to the city that " it take the extremely difficult political actions it must take to put its fiscal and financial house in order . " As possible actions . Mr. Simon said that the layoffs of policemen and firemen had to be- considered : expense budget ; items had to be removed from the city 's capital budget and permanent long-range economies and reduction of the city 's short-term indebtedness had to be attained . He said that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility . " According to President Ford 's letter , the Mayor and the Governor had asked " me for my support for Federal legislation which would enable the City of New York to use the credit of the United States for a period of 90 days and in the amount of S1-billion . " Because of the period cited , it appeared that Mr. Beame was not only seeking the solution of the cash flow predicament he faces with regard to the city 's current budget , but that he also would have used the prospects of the future Federal money as one basis for presenting a balanced budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 . Currently that new budget has a projected deficit of S641.5-million . Mr. Ford said he was " deeply impressed " with both the city 's problems and " the difficult steps confronting you to eliminate the extraordinary imbalance between current revenues and current expenses . " But despite that , the President said , it was evident that the city 's problem was not new " but has been a long time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
