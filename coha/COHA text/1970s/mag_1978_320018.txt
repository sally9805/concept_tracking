There are only a few clues at the house in the valley . <P> The furniture , marginally stylish when new , shows the wear of a decade and the impact of two lively kids . A Kiss album has been left abandoned on a sofa that Elton John would n't allow in the servants ' quarters . A silver-blue Mercedes-Benz is parked in the concrete driveway , but automotive ostentation is endemic to Los Angeles , even to such a comparatively modest suburb as Woodland Hills . <P> The license plate gives a little away : NUM 1 . This is not wish fulfillment on a rear bumper , though . The owner of this Mercedes rates . In a time of phenomenal success for the record business ( 698.2 million albums , singles and tapes were sold for $3.5 billion in 1977 ) , Al Coury , president , head honcho and chief dervish of Robert Stigwood 's RSO Records , has taken a penthouse on top of the sales curve , even as his family stays snug in their San Fernando Valley tract house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did when I was making $18,000 a year for Capitol , " Coury says . " Who needs Bel Air ? My kids go to good schools , my wife 's involved with the women 's league at church . It 's just my lawyers . They think I 'm crazy . " <P> They are the only ones . This year , RSO will sell more than $300 million worth of records . Al Coury spearheaded the runaway success of the Grease and Saturday Night Fever sound tracks , making them two of the alltime Top Ten albums . He insists that the Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band sound track package will sell 4.6 million units . For 42 weeks of 1978 , RSO albums occupied the top slot on the charts . During one of those weeks , the RSO logo-a benign , bright red castrated bull-graced the labels on three of the top five albums . During two of those weeks , across the way on the singles charts , RSO claimed four of the top five . Music biz stats like this burn the giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such a fact was not lost on anyone in the record business , least of all Robert Stigwood . " I knew Al was dedicated to music , " Stigwood said . " I just did n't know he was that dedicated . " The grateful board chairman cut Coury in for some additional pieces of the corporate pie , a consideration valued at well over $5 million . Said Stigwood : " Al 's worth a lot to me.
