THE SECRET WOMAN " I can only wish you bon voyage . " " Thank you . I hope you will think of me while I 'm away and perhaps pray for those in peril on the sea . " " I hope you wo n't need my prayers . " " When you know me better you 'll realize that I need them more than most . " When you know me better ! I should have guessed at the state of my feelings when a simple phrase like that and its implication could delight me . He was going away , but when I knew him better .. . " You strike me as being very self-sufficient . " " Do you think any of us really are that ? " " I think some of us may be . " " You ? " he asked . " I have not yet had the time to discover . " " You have always been cosseted ? " " Hardly that . But you have just made me realize that I have never exactly been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you sit down ? " He looked round him and I laughed . " That 's how I felt when I first came here . I used to sit on a chair and say to myself , Perhaps Madame de Pompadour once sat here , or Richelieu or Talleyrand . " " Being less erudite such a thought would not occur to me . " " Let us go into my aunt 's sitting room , that is more . . . habitable . That is if you have time to stay for . . . a little while . " " I 'm sailing at seven in the morning . " He gave me that quizzical look . " I should leave before that . " I laughed as I led the way up the stairs and through our clutteredrooms . He was interested in some of the Chinese pieces which Aunt Charlotte had recently bought . I had forgotten how she had to make room for them in her sitting room . " Aunt Charlotte bought rather lavishly on this occasion , " I said . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a collector . " I felt I had to go on talking because I was so excited that he had come to see me . " Do you like this cabinet ? We call it a chest-on-chest . The lacquer is rather fine .

" " Nothing compared with my aunt . But I 'm learning . It takes a lifetime though . " " And , " he said gravely studying me , " there are so many other things in life to learn . " " You must be an expert on . . . the sea and ships . " " I shall never be an expert on anything . " " Who is ? But where will you sit ? This is perhaps more comfortable . It 's a good sturdy Spanish chair . " He was smiling . " What happened to the desk you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know who was the buyer . " " I did not come to talk about furniture , " he said . " No ? " " But to talk to you . " " I do n't think you 'd find me very interesting . . . apart from all this . " He looked round the room . " It 's almost as though they 're trying to make a period piece of you . " There was a moment 's silence and I was suddenly aware of all the ticking clocks . I heard myself say almost involuntarily : " Yes , I think that is what I fear . I see myself living here , growing old , learning more and more until I know as much as Aunt Charlotte . As you say , a period piece . " " That must n't happen , " he said . " The present should be lived in . " I said : " It was good of you to call , on your last evening . " " I should have called before , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on but he had decided not to . " I heard about you , " he said . " You heard about me ? " " Miss Brett the Elder is well-known in Langmouth . I heard that she drives a hard bargain . " 42 THE SECRET WOMAN " Lady Crediton told you that . " " She was under the impression that she drove a harder one . That was the occasion when we first met . " And then : " What do you know about me ? " I was afraid to repeat Ellen 's story in case it was wrong . " I had heard that you live at the Castle , that you are not Lady Crediton 's son . " " Then you will understand that I was in a somewhat invidious position from the beginning . " He began to laugh . " I can talk to you of this somewhat indelicate matter . That is why I find your companystimulating . You are not the sort of woman to refuse to discussa subject simply because it is . . . unconventional . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you have heard . Yes , it 's true . Sir Edward was my father ; I was brought up as a son of the house , and yet not with the same status as my half brother . All very reasonable , do n't you think ? It 's had its effect on my character , though . I was always trying to outdo Rex in everything , as much as to say , See I 'm as good as you are . ' Do you think that excuses a boy for being shall we say arrogant , eager to attract attention , always wanting to win ? Rex is the most patient of fellows . Far more worthy than I but then I always say he did n't have to prove he was as good . He was accepted as being better . " " You are n't one of those tiresome people with a chip on your shoulder , I hope ? " He laughed . " No , I 'm not . In fact trying so hard for so long to convince people that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . " " That 's all to the good . I could never bear people who are sorry for themselves , perhaps because there was a time when I started to feel life had treated me rather harshly . That was when my mother died . " I told him about my mother , how beautiful she was , how enchanting , her plans for my future , how my father and I had doted on her ; and then I went on to speak of his death and how I was left , an orphan , at the mercy of Aunt Charlotte . THE QUEEN 'S HOUSE 43I was unusually animated . He had that effect on me . I felt I was being amusing , interesting , attractive and I was happier than I had been since my mother died . No , I was happier than I had ever been in my life . I wanted this evening never to stop . There was a gentle tap on the door and Ellen came in , brighteyedand conspiratorial . " I was going to say , miss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be joining you for it , I could serve in fifteen minutes or so . " He declared his delight in the suggestion . His eyes rested on Ellen and I noticed that the color deepened in her cheeks . Could it be that he had the same effect on her as he had on me ? " Thank you , Ellen , " I said , and I was ashamed that I had felt a little jealous . No , it was not really that , but the thought occurred to me that his charm was not for me alone ; he possessed it in such abundance that he could afford to squander it so that even a maid announcing a meal was aware of it . Was I attaching too much importance to his interest ? Ellen had set a meal in the dining room and had , greatly daring , put two lighted candles in the lovely carved gilded **30;12025;TOOLONG and had set them at either end of the Regency table ; she had placed two Sheraton dining-room chairs opposite each other and the table looked delightful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with porcelain and Wedgwood pottery , but the candles lightingthe table shut off the rest of the room and the effect was charming . It was like a dream . Aunt Charlotte never entertained . I wonderedfleetingly what she would think if she could see us now , and I thought too how different life here would be without Aunt Charlotte . But why think of her on such an evening ? Ellen was in high spirits . I imagined her giving an account of it all to Mr. Orfey the next day . I knew she believed  --  for she had told me often  --  that it was time I had " a bit of life . " This would be in her opinion a very delectable slice of life , not just a bit . She brought in the soup in a tureen with deep blue flower deco-44 THE SECRET WOMANrations and the plates matched . I caught my breath with horror that we should be using such precious plates . There was cold chicken to follow and I was thankful that Aunt Charlotte was to be away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aunt Charlotte ate little herself and kept a very meager table . But Ellen had worked wonders with what she had ; she had turned cold potatoes into delicious saute and had cooked a cauliflowerwhich she served with a cheese and chive sauce . Ellen seemed to be in possession of new powers on that night . Or perhaps I imagined that everything tasted different from what it had before . We talked and every now and then Ellen would come in to serve , looking very pretty and excited ; I was sure there had never been a happier scene in the Queen 's House , even when Queen Elizabeth was entertained here . I was full of fancies . It was as though the house approved and the alien pieces retreated as I sat in the dining room at the Regency table entertaining my guest . There was no wine  --  Aunt Charlotte was a teetotaler  --  but that was of no importance . He talked about the sea and foreign places and he made me believe I was there , and when he spoke of his ship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was taking out a cargo of cloth and manufactured goods to Sydney and when he was there he would do a certain amount of trading with the Pacific ports before bringing wool back to England . The ship was not big ; she was under a thousand tons but he would like me to see how she could cut through the water . She was in the clipper class , and you could n't find anything speedier than that . But he was talking too much about himself . I protested . No . I wanted to hear it . I was fascinated . I had often been down to the docks and seen the ships there and wondered where they were going . Were they entirely cargo ships , I wanted to know . " We take some passengers , though cargo 's the main business . As a matter of fact I have a very important gentleman sailing with me tomorrow . He 's primarily a diamond merchant and going outTHE QUEEN 'S HOUSE 45to look at Australian opals . He has quite a conceit of himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can present problems on ships like ours . " And so we talked and the clocks ticked on furiously and maliciouslyfast . And as we talked I said : " You have n't told me the name of your ship . " " Have n't I ? It 's The Secret Woman . " " The Secret Wonsan . Why . . . that 's what it said on the figure which was in the desk we bought from Castle Crediton . It 's in my room . I 'll go and get it . " I picked up the candlestick from the table . It was heavy and he took it from me . " I 'll carry it , " he said . " Be careful with it . It 's precious . " " Like everything in the house . " " Well , not everything . " And I turned and side by side we went up the stairs . " Be careful , " I said , " as you see we 're very cluttered . " " I understand it 's the shop window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I found this figure in the desk . I suppose we should have returned it to you but Aunt Charlotte said it was worthless . " " I 'm sure Aunt Charlotte , as usual , was right . " I laughed . " She almost always is , I have to admit . " And thinking of Aunt Charlotte I marveled afresh that I could have dared to invite him to supper as I had  --  although Ellen had made that inevitable . But I was very willing , so it was no use blaming her . I refused to think of Aunt Charlotte at such a time ; she was safely out of the way in some dingy hotel bedroom  --  she would never stay at the best hotels and poor Mrs. Morton was no doubt having a very trying time . We stepped up into the room above . I always thought the house was eerie in candlelight because the furniture took on odd shapes  --  some grotesque , some almost human , and as they changed constantlythey rarely became familiar . " What an odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Genuinely old , " I told him . And I laughed aloud to think of Aunt Charlotte 's verdict on Castle Crediton : Fakel He wanted to know why I laughed and I told him . " She has the utmost contempt for fakes . " " And you ? " I hesitated . " It would depend on the fake . Some are very clever . " " I suppose one would have to be clever to be a successful faker . " " I suppose so . Oh mind this , please . See how that edge of thattable juts out . I did n't see it in the shadow . It 's rather dangerousthere , so near the stair . " We had reached my bedroom . " Miss Anna Brett slept here , " he said with mock reverence . I was very lighthearted . " Do you think we should fix a plaqueon the wall ? Queen Elizabeth and Anna Brett . . . ' Perhaps theyought to call it Anna Brett House instead of the Queen 's House . " " It 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figure . " I took it from the drawer in which I kept it . He put down the candlestick on the dressing table and took it from me . He laughed . " It 's the figurehead of The Secret Woman , " he said . " A figurehead . " " Yes , no doubt there was a model of the ship and this was broken off . " " It 's of no value ? " " None whatever . Except of course that it represents the figureheadof my ship , which might give it a little value in your eyes . " " Yes , " I said . " It does . " he handed it back to me and I must have held it somewhat reverently , for he laughed . " You can take it up now and then , look at it and think of me on the bridge as it plows through the waves . " " The Secret Woman , " I said . " It 's a strange name for a ship . Secret , and Woman . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment I heard the sound of a door being shut ; I heard voices below and felt the goose pimples rise on my flesh . THE QUEEN 'S HOUSE 47 " What 's wrong ? " he asked and he took me by the arms and held me close to him . I said weakly : " My aunt has come home . " My heart was beating so wildly that I could scarcely think . Why had she come home so soon ? But why not ? The sale had not been so interesting as she had hoped ; she hated hotel bedrooms ; she would not stay in one longer than she could help . It did n't matter for what reason she had come . The point was that she was here . Perhaps at this moment she was looking at the remains of our feast . . . the lighted candle  --  only one because we had the other here  --  the precious china . Poor Ellen , I thought . I looked wildly about the room  --  at my bed , the **28;12057;TOOLONG pieces of furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tallboy and . . . ourselves . Redvers Stretton was actually alone with me in my bedroom and Aunt Charlotte was in the house ! I must at least go downstairsas quickly as possible . He understood and picked up the candle which he had put on the dressing table . But we could not hurry of course ; we must pick our way carefully . As we came to the turn of the staircase and looked down at the hall , Aunt Charlotte saw us . Mrs. Morton was standing beside her ; Ellen was there too , white-faced and tense . " Anna ! " said Aunt Charlotte in a voice which reverberated like thunder . " What do you think you are doing ? " The Queen 's House could never have known a more dramatic moment : Redvers towering above me  --  he was very tall and he was standing one stair up ; the candlelight flickering ; our shadows on the wall ; and Aunt Charlotte standing there in her traveling cloak and bonnet , her face white with the strain of fatigue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as a woman , powerful and malevolent . I walked down the stairs and he kept close to me . " Captain Stretton called , " I said trying to speak naturally . He took the matter out of my hands . " Perhaps I should explain , Miss Brett . I had heard so much of your wonderful treasure store48 THE SECRET WOMANthat I could not resist coming to see it for myself . I was not expectingsuch hospitality . " She was a little taken aback . Was she , too , susceptible to that charm ? She grunted and said : " You can scarcely judge antiques by candlelight . " " Yet it must often have been by candlelight that those wonderfullywrought pieces were shown in the past , Miss Brett . I wanted to get the effect by candlelight . And Miss Brett kindly allowed me to do this . " She was assessing his possibilities as a buyer . " What are you particularly interested in , Captain Stretton ? " I said quickly , " Captain Stretton was greatly impressed by the Levasseur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine piece , " she said . " You 'd never regret having it . It would be very easy to place if ever you wanted to pass it on . " " I am sure of it , " he said earnestly . " Have you seen it in daylight ? " Her voice was ironical . She did n't believe for one moment in this act . To her it was an absurd charade . " No . That 's a pleasure in store for me . " Aunt Charlotte was staring at the candlestick in his hand . " Aunt Charlotte , " I said , " you must be very tired after your journey . " " Then I should take my leave , " said Redvers . " And thank you for your kind hospitality . " " And the Levasseur ? " " In daylight , " he said . " As you tell me I should . " " Come tomorrow , " she said , " I 'll show it to you myself . " He bowed . " Ellen will show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said firmly : " I will . " And I went with him to the door . I stood in the garden with him . I was talking wildly about the cabinet . " That marquetry ofTHE QUEEN 'S HOUSE 49brass on the tortoiseshell background is really very beautiful . There is no doubt that it is genuine Levasseur . . . " " Oh , no doubt at all , " he said . It was autumn and I could smell the peculiar odor of chrysanthemumsand the dampness of the ground and the mist on the river . Whenever I smell those smells I remember that night . My enchantedevening was over ; and he was going away . I was shut in my prison ; he would leave me for his life of adventure and I would go back to my infuriated jailer . " I think she is a little put out , " he said . " I 'm sorry . " " I thought she would be away another night . " " I meant I 'm sorry I 'm going away . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could face it if . . . " He knew what I meant . If he were there to face it with me , if I could see him now and then , even if they were stolen meetings , I would not care . I was twenty-one years of age . I did not have to be Aunt Charlotte 's slave forever . " I wish it had been different , " he said , and I wondered what he meant by that . I waited for him to go on , and I knew I could not stay long . Inside the Queen 's House Aunt Charlotte was waiting . " Different ? " I insisted . " You mean you wish you had n't come ? " " I could n't wish that , " he said . " It was a wonderful evening until the ogress returned . She did n't believe me , you know , about that ... thing . " " No , " I said , " she did n't . " " I hope it is not going to be . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came was so very agreeable . " " You found it so ? " I could not hide my feelings . " The most agreeable evening I have . . . " No I must not be so naive . I finished , " That I have spent for a long time . " " I shall be back , " he said . " When ? " " Perhaps sooner than you think . " He took my face in his hands and looked at me ; I thought he50 THE SECRET WOMANwas going to kiss me , but he seemed to change his mind and suddenly , he was gone and I was alone in the autumn-scented garden . I went back into the house . Aunt Charlotte was not there . Ellen was clearing the table . " Your aunt 's gone to bed , " she said . " Mrs. Morton 's helping her . She 's worn out . She says she 'll see you , and me , in the morning . Oh miss  --  we 're in for it , we really are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short time ago he had been there with me . He had brought a magical touch to my life and now he was gone . I had been foolish to imagine . . . ' What had I imagined ? ' What did a young woman who was not outstandingly attractive have to interest a man who must surely be the most charming in the world ? And yet . . . there was something in the manner in which he had looked at me . Had I shown too clearly my feelings ? I took out the figurehead and set it on the dressing table . Then I undressed and when I got into bed I took the figurehead with me  --  a foolish childish gesture , but I found it comforting . It was a long time before I could sleep but at last I dozed . I awoke with a start . It was the creak of a floorboard  --  the sound of a footstep on the stair which had disturbed me . Someone was comingup to the top of the house . . . footsteps and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed ; I stared at the door which slowly opened and she stood there . She looked grotesque in her camel's-hair dressing gown with the military buttons , her long gray hair in a coarse thick plait , and in her hand the ebony-topped stick which she used since her arthritis made it difficult for her to walk about . She carried a candle  --  in a plain wooden stick , not one of our valuable ones . She glared at me . " You may well look ashamed of yourself , " she said . Her laughter was horrible , sneering and in a way coarse . " I could n't sleep for thinking of what happened tonight . " " I have done nothing of which to be ashamed . " THE QUEEN 'S HOUSE 51 " That 's what you tell me . So you waited until I was out of the way before you brought him in . How often has he been here ? You 're not telling me this was the first time . " " It was the first time . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know it then but she needed me far more than I needed her . She was a lonely old woman who had to rely on people like Mrs. Morton ; but I was to be her salvation . I was going to look after her and the business ; she had trained me for just that . And what she feared was that I would marry and leave her  --  as Emily Beringer had . She looked round the room . " You 're feeling lonely now he 's gone , I daresay . Do n't tell me he was n't up here . I saw the light from the garden . You ought to have thought to draw the curtains . But then you were n't expecting to be seen , were you ? You thought you had the place all to yourself and that Ellen , she was in it , too . A nice example to her , I must say . " " Ellen was not to blame . " " She served your supper on the Delft , did n't she ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish as bringing him up here to your bedroom . " " Aunt Charlotte ! " " Do n't play the innocent with me . I know you were up here . I saw the light . Look . There 's candle grease on the dressing table . Did n't I see you come down together ? Oh , I wonder you can lie there , so brazen . You 're another such as your mother , you are . I said at the time it was a pity your father ever took up with her . " I said : " Be silent , you wicked old woman . " " That sort of talk will get you nowhere . " " I wo n't stay here , " I said . It was the worst thing I could have said . She turned her rage on me . " You ungrateful girl ! I did everything for you . What would have happened to you if I had n't taken you in , eh ? It would have been an orphanage , I can tell you . There was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've tried to make you useful . I 've taught you all you know . . . to give you a chance of paying me back and this is what you do . Bring strange men52 THE SECRET WOMANinto the house as soon as my back 's turned . Your mother all over again ... I should n't wonder . " " How dare you say such things . My mother was good , better than you could ever be . And I ... " " And you are good , too ? Oh , very good . Very good to young men who visit you when my back 's turned . " " Stop it ! Stop it ! " " You dare to order me in my house . " " I 'll go if you like . " " Where to ? " " I 'll find some post . I know something about antiques . " " Which I have taught you . " " I could be a governess or a companion . " She laughed . " Oh yes , you 're very clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might owe me something ? You might think about that . A fine fool you are . Making yourself cheap to the first man who comes along . And from that place too . I should have thought you would have known better where someone of that reputation is concerned . " " What reputation ? " She chuckled . " You ought to select with more care . I can tell you that Captain Redvers Stretton has not a very good name in this town . He 's the sort who 's going to take his fun where he finds it . And I 'll daresay that he 's ready to try all sorts . " I could only cry : " Go away . I do n't want to hear what you have to say . I 'll leave here . If you want to get rid of me , if I 'm such a burden ... " " You 're a rash and foolish girl , " she said . " You need me to look after you . Your father was my brother and I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you in the morning . I 'm worn out ... and my pain is terrible . I could n't sleep for thinking about you . I thought I 'd speak to you tonight . But tomorrow perhaps you 'll be in a more contrite mood . " She turned and went out . I stared at the door . I was hurt and angry ; the evening had changed . She had smirched it with her evilTHE QUEEN 'S HOUSE 53thoughts and her talk of his reputation . What did she mean by that ? What did she know ? And then suddenly there was a piercing scream and the heavythud of something falling . I got out of bed and ran to the stairs . Aunt Charlotte was lying at the foot of that flight , groaning . I ran down . " Aunt Charlotte , " I said . " Are you hurt ? " She did not answer ; she was breathing heavily . I called Mrs. Morton and Ellen . Foolishly I tried to lift my aunt ; I could n't , so I found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came hurrying . With her fine hair in curlers under a net she looked different , grim , excited . " My aunt must have slipped coming down the stairs , " I said , I remembered warning Redvers . " At this time of night , " said Mrs. Morton . She picked up the candlewhich Aunt Charlotte had dropped . There was the faintest moonlight shining through the window . Aunt Charlotte began to groan again . I said : " Put on your cloak , Ellen , and go and ask Dr. Elgin to come . " Ellen ran off and Mrs. Morton and I stayed with Aunt Charlotte . " How did it happen ? " asked Mrs. Morton . She looked rather pleased , I thought , and I imagined what it had been like traveling with Aunt Charlotte . " She came to my room to talk to me and fell on the way back to her own . " " She was in a rage , I daresay , " said Mrs. Morton . She looked at me obliquely ; I realized that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be shut in with some secret life of her own . I wondered why she endured Aunt Charlotte'stantrums . Surely she could have found more congenial employmentelsewhere ? I could think of no reason for her staying but that of Ellen : that she would be remembered in my aunt 's will if she were still in her employ . It seemed a long time before Ellen returned . Dr. Elgin would be with us shortly , she said . When he came he said we should get Aunt Charlotte to bed at54 THE SECRET WOMANonce . I was to make hot sweet tea for her because she was suffering from shock . He thought she had been lucky for no bones were broken . As I made the tea Ellen said : " What a night this has been ! Do you know , I reckon this could knock years off her life . A fall like that , at her age ... " And I knew that she was thinking of taking her legacy to Mr. Orfey . Life changed after that . It was the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fall and this had aggravated her arthritis . There were days when she could not walk except to potter about the house and sometimes she could not even do that . She could not always go to sales ; I had to go . I became a well known figure at them . At first I was treated with mild contempt ; but this so angered me that I determined not to miss anything and I became more and more knowledgeable , so that they had to respect me . " She 's her aunt all over again , " it was said . And I was rather pleased because the only way in which I could bear to resemble Aunt Charlotte was in her knowledge . More than anything Aunt Charlotte had changed . I made excusesfor her in the beginning . A woman with her energetic mind must find it tragic to be physically incapacitated . It was small wonder that she was irritable and bad tempered ; she had never been convivial but now she seemed to hate us all . Continually she reminded me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern for me that had made her come to my bedroom ; it was because she was so upset by my conduct that she had carelesslywalked into the edge of that table and tripped . I had cost her her health and vigor ; I owed it to her to repay her in any way I could . The household had never been gay ; it now became grim and melancholy . She would sit propped up in her chair in her sitting room on her good days and go through the accounts . She never allowed me to see them ; she herself did most of the buying . SheTHE QUEEN 'S HOUSE 55would allow me no authority although my knowledge was growing and was not far behind her own . I began to experience once more that feeling that the Queen 's House was a prison ; and just as in the old days I had dreamed of reunion with my mother as my means of escape now I thought of that evening with Redvers and I told myself : He will come home from his voyage and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months passed and I heard nothing of him . The autumn was with us  --  the smell of dahlias and chrysanthemums in the garden ; the damp mist was rising from the river and it was the anniversaryof that evening and still I heard no news of him . Aunt Charlotte was getting more crippled , more irritable . Scarcely a day passed during which she did not remind me where my duty lay . I went on waiting and hoping that one day Redvers would seek me out , but he never did . It was Ellen who brought news to me . Her sister still worked for the Creditons . She had married the butler and had come up in the world . Lady Crediton was pleased with her and although she was not exactly a housekeeper , she was in charge of the maids which , being the butler 's wife , was very convenient . Ellen said to me one day when she was helping me to take some Ferrybridge pottery from one of the cabinets and pack it for a customer : " Miss Anna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday morning . " I looked at her in some alarm ; she was clearly distressed and I wondered whether Mr. Orfey had grown tired of waiting for her legacy and turned to someone else . " I went up to the Castle yesterday to see our Edith . " I avoided looking at her ; I must handle the pottery very carefully . " Yes , " I said . " There 's news of the Captain . " " The Captain , " I repeated foolishly . " Captain Stretton . Something awful 's happened . " " Not ... dead ? " 56 THE SECRET WOMAN " Oh no , no ... but some awful disgrace or something . He lost his ship . " " You mean it was ... sunk . " " Something like that . They 're all talking about it up at the Castle . It 's something dreadful . And he 's miles away . And it 's some disgrace , but there 's something else , Miss Anna . " " What , Ellen ? " " He 's married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife in foreign parts . He must have been married when he came here that night . Who 'd have thought it ! " I did n't believe it . He would have said so . But why should he discuss his private affairs ? I must have misunderstood bitterly . I had thought ... What had I thought ? I was a simpleton . I was all Aunt Charlotte said I was . That evening had meant nothing to him . Two people could see the same event entirely differently . He had called on me because he had nothing else to do before he sailed . Perhaps he knew how I felt about him and was amused . Perhaps he had told his wife about that last evening . The meal by candlelight , the arrival of Aunt Charlotte . I suppose it could be seen as comic . " How interesting , " I said . " I had no idea , had you , miss ? " " Of what ? " " That he was married of course . He kept it dark . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped that . There would have been trouble if that had been broken . " Broken , I thought dramatically , like my dreams , like my hopes . Because I had been hoping . I had really believed that one day he would come back to me and then I would begin to be happy . Captain Redvers Stretton was married . I heard it from several sources . He had married somewhere abroad , married a foreigner , so they said . He had been married for some time . When Aunt Charlotte heard , which she did inevitably , she laughed as I had rarely seen her laugh before . And from that dayTHE QUEEN 'S HOUSE 57she taunted me . She never lost an opportunity of bringing his name into the conversation . " Your Captain Stretton . Your eveningvisitor . So he had a wife all the time! Did he tell you that ? " " Why should he ? " I asked . " People who come to look at the furniture do n't feel it necessary to acquaint one with their family history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at Levasseurs might . " She laughed . She was better tempered than she had been for a long time , but spiteful and malicious . He came home I believe but I did n't see him . I heard from Ellen that he was there . And the time passed  --  one day very like another , spring , summer , autumn , winter ; and nothing to make one week different from another except perhaps that we sold one of the Chinese pieces which nobody seemed to want , for what Aunt Charlotte called an excellent price but which I believed was what she had paid for it . She was relieved to see it go . " You would n't find another like that , " she said . " Carved red lacquer . Fifteenth century of the Hsuan Te period . " " And you would n't find another buyer either , " I retaliated . We were like that together , constantly bickering ; I was getting old and sour and so was everyone in that house . Ellen had lost some of her exuberance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted the legacy she would get more than he wanted her . Mrs. Morton was more withdrawn than ever ; she went off on her free days once a fortnight and we never knew where she went . She was mysterious and secretive in her ways . I was twenty-five  --  no longer young . Sometimes I thought : It is four years since that night . And it meant nothing to him because all the time he was married and he did n't tell me . He implied ... But had he implied or had I imagined it ? Aunt Charlotte never forgot . She was constantly reminding me that I had behaved like a fool . I had been an innocent and he had known it . It seemed amusing to her ; she would titter in an infuriating way when she spoke of it . It was the only subject she ever found amusing . Oh , the dreariness of the Queen 's House with four women growing old and sad , all waiting for something to change their58 THE SECRET WOMANdrab and dreary lives . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could marry Mr. Orfey . Mrs. Morton was no doubt waiting for what she would get . And I ... At least I thought I should be free . Why did n't I go away ? Could I have found a post ? Perhapssomewhere in England there must be an antique dealer who could make use of my services ; and yet much as I hated her  --  for hate her I did at times  --  I felt a responsibility toward Aunt Charlotte . If I went she would be bereft . I was doing more and more of the essential work . I could run the business alone  --  except of course that I was never allowed to see the accounts . But in my heart I believed that I had a duty to her . She was my father 's sister . She had taken me in when my parents left me in England ; she had looked after me when I became an orphan . The clocks ticked on . There was a very special significance in their ticking now . Aunt Charlotte had grown worse ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her spine had aggravated her complaint , said Dr. Elgin . Her bedroom had become an office . She still kept a tight hold on the books and I was never allowed to see them ; but I was taking over all the selling and a great deal of the buying , though everything had to be submitted to her first and accounts passed through her hands . I was very busy . I devoted myself passionately to my work and if ever Ellen or Mrs. Buckle started to talk about what was happening up at Castle Crediton I implied that I was not interested . One day Dr. Elgin asked to see me ; he had just come down from Aunt Charlotte 's room . He said : " She 's getting worse . You ca n't manage her without help . There 'll come a time very soon when she 'll be completely bedridden . I suggest you have a nurse . " I could see the point of this but it was , I said , a matter I should have to discuss with my aunt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impress on her that you ca n't doTHE QUEEN 'S HOUSE 59all that you do and be an attendant in the sick room . She needs a trained nurse . " Aunt Charlotte was against the idea at first but eventually gave in . And then everything changed because Chantel Loman had arrived. 4How can I describe Chantel ? She was dainty and reminded me of a Dresden china figure . She had that lovely shade of hair made famous by Titian , with rather heavy brows and dark lashes ; her eyes were a decided shade of green and I thought her coloring the most arresting I had ever seen . She had a straight little nose and a delicatelycolored complexion which , with her slender figure , gave her the Dresden look . If she had a fault it was the smallness of her mouth but I thought  --  and this had occurred to me with some of the finest works of art I handled  --  that it was the slight imperfectionwhich added something to beauty . Perfect beauty in art and nature could become monotonous ; that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to me . When she first came into the Queen 's House and sat on the carved Restoration chair which happened to be in the hall at that time , I thought : " She 'll never stay here . She 'll not come in the first place . " But I was wrong . She said afterward that the place fascinated her , as I did . I looked so ... forbidding . A regular old maid in my tweed skirt and jacket and my very severe blouse and my really lovely hair pulled back and screwed up in a way which destroyed its beauty and was criminal . Chantel talked like that  --  underlining certain words and she had a way of laughing at the end of a sentence as though she were laughing at herself . Anyone less like a nurse I could not imagine. 6o THE SECRET WOMANI took her up to Aunt Charlotte and oddly enough  --  or though perhaps I should say naturally enough  --  Aunt Charlotte took a fancy to her on the spot . Chantel charmed naturally and easily , I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Ellen . " Things will be different now she 's come . " And they were . She was bright and efficient . Even Aunt Charlottegrumbled less . Chantel was interested in the house and explored it . She told me later that she thought it was the most interesting house she had ever been in . When Aunt Charlotte had been made comfortable for the night Chantel would come and sit in my room and talk . I think she was glad to have someone more or less her own age in the house . I was twenty-six and she was twenty-two ; but she had lived a more interesting life , had traveled with her last patient a little and seemed to me a woman of the world . I felt happier than I had for a long time and so was the entire household . Ellen was interested in her and I believe confided in her about Mr. Orfey . Even Mrs. Morton was more communicative with her than she had ever been with me , for it was Chantel who told me that Mrs. Morton had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morton 's unmarried sister five miles from Langmouth . That was where she went on her days off ; and she had come to the Queen 's House and endured the whims of Aunt Charlotte and the lack of comforts because it enabled her to be near her daughter . She was waiting for the day she would retire and they would live together . " Fancy her telling you all that , " I cried . " How did you manage to get her to talk ? " " People do talk to me , " said Chantel . She would stand at my window looking out on the garden and the river and say that it was all fascinating . She was vitally interested in everything and everybody . She even learned something about antiques . " The money they must represent , " she said . " But they have to be bought first , " I explained to her . " AndTHE QUEEN 'S HOUSE 61some of them have not been paid for . Aunt Charlotte merely houses them and gets a commission if she makes a sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said admiringly . " You have your profession which is no doubt more useful . " She grimaced . At times she reminded me of my mother ; but she was efficient as my mother would never have been . " Preserving lovely old tables and chairs might be more useful than preserving some fractious invalids . I 've had some horrors I can tell you . " Her conversation was amusing . She told me she had been brought up in a vicarage . " I know now why people say poor as church mice . That 's how poor we were . All that economy . It was soul-destroying , Anna . " We had quickly come to Christian names , and hers was so pretty I said it was a shame not to use it . " There was Papa saving the souls of his parishioners while his poor children had to live on bread and dripping . Ugh ! Our mother was dead  --  died with the birth of the youngest , myself . There were five of us . " " How wonderful to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful when you 're poor . We all decided to have professions and I chose nursing because , as I said to Selina , my eldest sister , that will take me into the houses of the rich and at least I can catch the crumbs that fall from the rich man 's table . " " And you came here ! " " I like it here , " she said . " The place excites me . " " At least we sha n't give you bread and dripping . " " I should n't mind if you did . It would be worth it to be here . It 's a wonderful house , full of strange things , and you are by no means ordinary , nor is Miss Brett . That is what is good about this profession of mine . You never know where it will lead you . " Her sparkling green eyes reminded me of emeralds . I said : " I should have thought anyone as beautiful as you would be married . " She smiled obliquely . " I have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , " I said . " No . Have you ? " 62 THE SECRET WOMANThat brought the color flooding my cheeks ; and before I could prevent myself I was telling her about Redvers Stretton . " A roving Casanova , " she said . " I wish I 'd been here then . I would have warned you . " " How would you have known that he had a wife abroad ? " " I would have found out , never fear . My poor dear Anna , you have to see it as a lucky escape . " Her eyes shone excitedly . " Think of what might have happened . " " What ? " I demanded . " He might have offered marriage and seduced you . " " What nonsense ! It was all my fault really . He never gave the slightest indication that he was ... interested in me . It was my foolish imagination . " She did not answer but from that moment she became very interested in Castle Crediton . I used to hear her talking about it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed ; Ellen was far more interested in Chantel than in me . I could understand it . She was wonderful . By a deft touch of flattery she could put even Aunt Charlotte in a good mood . Her charm lay in her interest in people ; she was avidly curious . After Ellen 's day off she would go to the kitchen to prepare a tray for Aunt Charlotte and I would hear them laughing together . Mrs. Buckle said : " That Nurse Loman 's a real bit of sunshine in the house . " I thought how right she was . It was Chantel who had the idea about our journals . Life , she said , was full of interest . " Some people 's , " I said . " All people 's , " she corrected me . " Nothing happens here , " I told her . " I lose count of the days . " " That shows you should keep a journal and write everythingdown . I have an idea . We both will and we 'll read each other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , living as close as we do we shallbe recording the same events . We 'll see them through each other'seyes . PrTHE QUEEN 'S HOUSE 63 " A journal , " I said . " I 'd never have time . " " Oh yes , you would . An absolutely truthful journal . I insist . You 'll be surprised what it will do for you . " And that was how we began to keep our journals . She was right , as she always seemed to be . Life did take on a new aspect . Events seemed less trivial ; and it was interesting to see how differently we recorded them . She colored everything with her own personality and my account seemed drab in comparison . She saw people differently , made them more interesting ; even Aunt Charlotte emerged as quite likeable in her hands . We had a great deal of pleasure out of our journals . The important thing was to put down exactly what one felt , said Chantel . " I mean , Anna , if you feel you hate me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the good of a journal that 's not truthful ? " So I used to write as though I were talking to myself and every week we would exchange our journals and see exactly how the other had felt . I often wondered how I had got through the days before Chantel came . She was as much a nurse to me in a way as she was to Aunt Charlotte only I did n't need the physical attention . It was only ten months since Chantel had come and the autumn was with us again . The autumn tints and smells still filled me with sorrow but my heart was considerably lightened . That summer had been a wet one and the damp atmosphere had had its effect on Aunt Charlotte ; she was still unable to leave her bed . How right Dr. Elgin had been when he said she needed a nurse . The ease with which fragile Chantel was able to lift her up with the help of Mrs. Morton , always astonished me . Aunt Charlotte 's disease had moved into an advanced stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . She fought against what she condemned as drugs but finally she gave in . " One a night , " said Dr. Elgin . " At most two . More would be fatal . " 64 THE SECRET WOMANThe pills were always kept in a cupboard in the anteroom as I called it which adjoined her room . The doctor said it was better not to have the pills near her bedside in case she was tempted to take more than the prescribed dose if her pains were acute , for the drug could become less effective after too frequent use . " Nurse Loman , you will see to that . " " You can trust me , Doctor , " said Chantel . And of course he did . He talked to me about Aunt Charlotte . How wise I was to have brought in Nurse Loman . My aunt was a very strong woman . There was nothing organically wrong with her . But for her arthritis she would be absolutely healthy . She could go on for years in her present state . The night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange experience . I awoke in the night to find myself standing by my bed . I was not sure what had happened to me . That I had had a strange dream I was sure , though I could not remember what . In my mind was the thought of us all growing old , waiting on Aunt Charlotte  --  Ellen , Mrs. Morton , myself , and Chantel . All I could remember from that dream were the words which were still ringing in my mind : " for years ... " And I was not sure how I came to be out of bed . At one moment I thought I remembered getting out of bed ; and the next I was sure I did not . It was a frightening experience . I went to the door of my room and stood there listening to the sounds of the house . Had something happened to disturb me ? I could only hear the faint soughing of the wind through the trees outside my window , the sudden creak of a floorboard . Then I was aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened ? Nothing but that I had been disturbed by a dream . The weeks passed . The winter was a hard one ; the east wind penetratedthe house and as Aunt Charlotte said " stiffened up her bones " and made it painful even to move . She was resigned now to being completely bedridden . Her feet were swollen and misshapenTHE QUEEN 'S ROUSE 65and she could not stand on them . She relied completely on Chanteland Mrs. Morton . I was away from the Queen 's House for whole days at a time , visiting sales , though I never went so far that I had to spend the night . A woman could not very easily travel alone . Besides I curtailed my trips as much as possible because it was difficult for business as there was no one to attend to customers while I was away . I had begun to suspect that Aunt Charlotte had often bought unwisely . The Chinese goods were still hanging fire . Her expert knowledge had often carried her away and she would buy a piece because of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a collector ; but our business was buying and selling . During that long hard winter I kept my journal up to date ; and so did Chantel . I learned all that was happening at home , all the little details , made amusing and lighthearted by Chantel ; and in more heavy style I wrote about my visits to sales and customers . And then one morning when I awoke to find a crisscross of frosty pattern on the windows it was to learn that Aunt Charlotte was dead . Chantel had gone in as usual at seven o'clock to take a cup of tea . She came running to my room . I shall never forget the sight of her standing there  --  her green eyes enormous , her face unusually pale , her titian hair falling about her shoulders . " Anna ... she 's gone ! I do n't understand it . We must send for Dr. Elgin at once . Ellen must go . " So he came , and we were told that she had died from an overdoseof her opium tablets which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she been able to take them ? The inference was obvious . Only if someone had given them to her . The Queen 's House had become not only a house of death , but a house of suspicion . We were questioned , all of us . No one had heard anything during the night . My room was immediately above Aunt Charlotte 's , 66 THE SECRET WOMANChantel 's was on the same floor , Ellen 's and Mrs. Morton 's were together on the other side of the house . I can not remember details of those days now for I did not write in my journal until after the inquest . Somehow I could not bring myself to do so . It was a nightmare ; I would not believe it was real . But there was one question which must be answered because the law demanded it . How had Aunt Charlotte taken sleeping pills which were kept in the next room when she could not walk ? The inference was : Only if someone gave them to her . And the inevitablequestion was : Who ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficiary . The Queen 's House and the antique business would be mine on her death . I was her only surviving relative ; it was a foregone conclusionthat everything would be mine . I had been trained with that object . The suggestion was there right from the start . Before anyone mentioned it : Had I become tired of waiting ? It hung about the house like some miasma , horrible , insinuating . Ellen was struck dumb , but I could see the speculation in her eyes . Had she got her legacy ? Would it satisfy Mr. Orfey ? Mrs. Morton seemed almost relieved . Life in the Queen 's I-Iouse had not been what Mrs. Buckle would call a bed of roses . Mrs. Buckle was too simple to hide her excitement . To be connected with a house in which sudden death had occurred had raised her prestige enormously . It was exhausting  --  the questions , the police , the inquest . What would have happened to me then but for Chantel ? I often wondered . She was like my guardian angel ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be well . Of course Aunt Charlottehad taken the pills herself . It was just what she would do . " She never would take her own life , " I cried . " Never . It would have been quite against her principles . " " You do n't know what pain can do to people ... pain that goes on and on and can only grow worse . I 've seen it happen . At first she did not want the opium pills at all and then she took them and was constantly asking for snore . " Oh yes , Chantel saved me . I shall never forget how valiantly sheTHE QUEEN 'S HOUSE 67did battle for me at the inquest . She looked lovely , yet so discreetin her black nurse 's cloak and her green eyes and reddish hair so strikingly attractive . She had more than beauty ; she had that power to win confidence and I could see that she carried everyone in the court along with her , as she had in the Queen 's House . She gave her evidence clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been unable to walk across the room in ordinary circumstances . But she had seen her achieve the seemingly impossibleand not only Aunt Charlotte but another patient she rememberedhad done the same . She would explain . A piece of furniture had been put into Miss Brett 's room ; it was a piece which her niece wanted her to buy and although Miss Brett was so crippled and suffered such pain she kept an alert eye on the business . She had actually left her bed to examine the small cabinet . Nurse Loman had been astonished because she had believed her patient could not walk . But in certain circumstances patients such as Miss Brett could summon up special powers . She believed Dr. Elgin would confirm this and in any case she had found Miss Brett beside the cabinet . It was true she had had to be almost carried back to bed but she had walked to the piece of furniture unaided . Nurse Lomanbelieved that this was what had happened during that night . The pain was intense ; the dose she had already taken had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to take more . Close to the chest on the top of which the opium pills were kept Nurse Lomanhad found a button from Miss Brett 's bediacket , and she knew that button had not been missing when she had given Miss Brett her pill and said goodnight . The bedjacket had been produced ; the button examined ; water had been spilled on the table close to Aunt Charlotte 's bed . The verdict was that Aunt Charlotte suffered great pain and had taken her own life while the balance of her mind was disturbed . But the matter did not rest there . The will was read . The businessand the Queen 's House were for me ; there was two hundred pounds for Mrs. Morton and  --  this was a surprise  --  two hundred for Chantel ; one hundred for Ellen and fifty for Mrs. Buckle. 68 THE SECRET WOMANChantel wrote in her journal : " What a surprise ! Although I knew she was a little fond of me . She must have added the codicil that day when the two important-looking gentlemen came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy her including me . Money is always comforting though . But I do wish it had n't happened as it did . Poor poor Anna ! She 's really very vulnerable . As for the others  --  particularly Ellen  --  they ca n't quite hide their jubilation . " Change had certainly come to the Queen 's House . Mrs. Morton wanted to leave at once and she did . Ellen said Mr. Orfey had no objection to her staying until I found someone else to suit . Chantel asked if she could stay on for a while although there would be no need for her services . " Please stay , " I begged , and she did . We used to sit in the Queen 's room  --  Chantel 's favorite room  --  and talk about the future . Sometimes she would lie on the Queen 's bed , very gingerly , always aware of its age and the need to preserve it , and say that she felt like the Queen . She tried to be lighthearted , but I found that difficult . I knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said . And Mrs. Buckle had often talked about the trouble that always seemed to be brewing between myself and my aunt , although everything did run more smoothly since Nurse Loman came . Chantel helped me sort things out . I soon learned that what I had inherited was mostly debts . What had happened to Aunt Charlotte ? In the last two or three years she had lost her judgment . No wonder she would not let me look at the books . I was horrifiedat the price she had paid for those Chinese pieces . There were other pieces too . Beautiful in themselves , but more suitable for museums than for private buyers . She had borrowed from the bank at a high rate of interest . I quickly realized that the business was on the edge of bankruptcy . Sometimes I would wake in the night and think I heard Aunt Charlotte 's mocking laughter . And then one night I woke with a THE QUEEN 'S HOUSE 69horrible thought in my mind . I remembered the night when I had found myself standing in my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Aunt Charlotte 's room and taking six of these opium pills , dissolving them in water and putting them at her bedside . She often drank water during the night . There was some spilt on the bedside table . Suppose . . . " What 's the matter ? " demanded Chantel . " You look as though you have n't slept a wink . " " I 'm terribly afraid , " I said , and she insisted on my telling her . " You did n't write in your journal about that dream you had some time ago . " " No , I thought it was too trivial . " " Nothing 's too trivial . And we promised to tell all . " She was mildly reproachful . " Is it important ? " " Yes , " she said , " everything is important . That 's what I 've learned in my profession . But never mind that now . Anna , you must get this suspicion out of your mind . " " I ca n't . I think I 'm suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it about the town . " " Gossips . They must have something to talk about . I found the button from her bedjacket , did n't I ? " " Did you , Chantel ? " " Did I ? What do you mean ? " " I wondered whether you were trying to save me . " " Listen , " she said , " I 'm sure it happened the way it did . " " Did you really see her get out of bed to look at the cabinet ? " " I do n't think we should talk about it . People can do thesethings . I tell you I 've seen it . And quite clearly it 's what she did . " " Chantel , " I said , " I believe you 've saved me from something ... very unpleasant . Perhaps it might have been proved ... SupposeI walked in my sleep ... " " What nonsense . You do n't walk in your sleep . You were half awake when you got out of bed . You were upset about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day . Listen to me , Anna . You 've got to put the whole thing out of your mind . You 've got to concentrate on pulling the business together . You 've got to forget the past . It 's the only way to go on . " " Oh Chantel , the best thing that has happened to me has been your coming here . " " I 've enjoyed the job , " she said . " You 'll be all right . You 'd have stood up to them all if it had come to the court . I know you would . But you have to stop working yourself up about the whole thing . It 's over . Finished . You 've got to start living now . Something wonderfulmight be happening in a few weeks ' time . " " TO me ? " " That 's the wrong attitude . Wonderful things can happen to us all . That 's how I 've lived my life . When I 've had the most horrid cases I 've said to myself : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What should I do without you ? " I asked . " You do n't have to ... yet . " She was right when she said that nothing remained static . She came to me one day and told me that Dr. Elgin had a post for her . " You 'll never guess where . Castle Crediton . " I felt stunned . First she was going to leave me and secondly she was going to the Castle . " It 's good news , " she said . " I have to work for my living and just think we sha n't be far apart . I 'll be able to see you ... fre-quently . " " Castle Crediton , " I repeated . " Is someone ill there ? Lady Cred-iton ? " " No , the old lady 's as strong as a horse . It 's Mrs. Stretton I 'm going to nurse . The Captain 's wife . " " Oh , " I said faintly . " Yes , she 's delicate . Our climate I expect . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going into a decline . There 's a child , too . I could n't resist the job when Dr. Elgin suggested it . " " When do you ... start ? " " Next week . " She leaned over and taking my hand pressed it firmly . " I 'll be near at hand . We 'll see each other often . And don'tTHE QUEEN 'S HOUSE 71forget there are our journals . Have you written in yours recently ? " " I could n't , Chantel . " " You must start at once . I 'll tell you all about Castle Crediton and the strange life of its inhabitants and you must tell me everything that happens here . " " Oh Chantel , " I cried , " what should I do without you ? " " To repeat oneself is a sign of encroaching age , I 've been told , " she said with a smile . " But I must say I found such repetition endearing . Do n't be morbid , Anna . You 're not alone . I 'm your friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly . I have to make plans . The business is rocky , Chantel . I shall have to see so many people  --  Aunt Charlotte 's lawyer and the bank manager , among others . " " It 'll keep you busy . Write it all in your journal . I 'll do the same . We 'll make a pact , we 'll tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth . And we 'll both have the comfort of knowing we are not alone . We can live our own lives and that of the other . " Her green eyes were enormous . " You must admit , Anna , that that is a very exciting state of affairs . " " We must never lose sight of each other , " I said . She nodded . " And we 'll exchange journals so that even when we ca n't see each other as often as we 'd like to , we shall know everything that is happening . " " I shall know everything that is happening to you in Castle Crediton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna , have you ever felt you would like to be a fly on the wall to hear and see everything and no one be aware of you there ? " " Who has n't ? " " Well , that 's how it is going to be . You 're the fly on my wall . " She laughed . How she lightened my spirits ! And how I was going to miss her ! Ellen , married to Mr. Orfey , came back to say that he had no objection to her coming in in the mornings to give a hand ; Mrs.72 THE SECRET WOMANBuckle continued to come in to dust and polish , but she left at four o'clock , and from then on I was alone in the Queen 's House . It was when the shadows fell that I would find myself brooding on Aunt Charlotte 's death . I would wake up suddenly from a dream in which I walked down to her room and took the pills from the bottle , to hear myself crying out : " No . No . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still listening to the clocks and it would seem as though they soothed me . It must have happened as Chantel said . There was no other explanation . I should not brood on the past . Goodness knows the future was stark enough . How was I going to pay Aunt Charlotte 's debts ? Many of the pieces which I believed were hers had not been paid for . She had spent far too much of her capital on the Chinese collection ; during the last years the business had not been paying its way . Alarming as this was it gave credence to Chantel 's theory . Obsessed by ever-increasing pain , always impatient of inactivity , seeing her debts rising and eventual bankruptcy , she had forced herself  --  and I knew the extent of her will power  --  to get out of bed and seek oblivion . I should have to make some decision . I could not allow things to drift . Indeed I should not be allowed to do so . I formed all sorts of plans . To advertise for a partner with money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales often meant cut prices . If I realized enough to pay my debts I should be lucky . There would be nothing left but the house . I could sell that perhaps . That was the answer . So my mind raced on during the sleepless nights and in the mornings when I looked at my face in the mirror I would murmur to myself : " Old Miss Brett . " Chantel came and left her journal for me while she took mine away . She would return with it the next day . That night I took it up to bed with me and the thought of readingit brought me out of my melancholy . My life was drab , and even frightening , but Chantel as before was my savior . To look in on what was happening at Castle C'rediton would give me theTHE QUEEN 'S HOUSE 73respite I needed . Besides I would always be particularly interested in anything that happened in Redvers Stretton 's home . I felt my spirits lighten a little as I lay back on my pillows and brought the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer to my bed and started to read Chantel 's journal . THE CASTLE5Aril 28th , 1887 . Today I came to Castle Crediton . I could n't help feeling rather pleased with myself . I had a new patient and I should not be too far from Anna . We should see each other frequently . I was going to make sure of that . The Castle I knew was not a real one . " Fake , " Miss Brett had called it , but that meant little to me . It had all the appearance of a castle and I liked driving under the great archway with the gate house overhead . But I never cared for antiquity . I 'll ask Anna about it all sometime , if I ever think of it . The stone walls of the castle looked as if they had been there for centuries . I wondered what had been done to give them that appearance . Another thing to ask Anna  --  if I ever think of it . As for myself I could n't help thinking how pleasant it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is an air of opulence about it ; and I feel sure that this castle will no doubt be more comfortable to live in than the genuine article . I alighted from the station fly which I had engaged to bring me and my belongings from the Queen 's House . I was in a sort of courtyard and there was an iron studded door with a bell beside it , rather like the one at the Queen 's House . I pulled this bell and a manservant appeared . " I 'm Nurse Loman , " I said . " Her ladyship is expecting you , " he answered . He was very dignified , the perfect butler . I had an idea that everything would be perfect in Castle Crediton  --  outwardly at least . I went into the hall which I was sure was the one Anna had once mentioned to me . Yes , there were the tapestries she had talked of , and which she had been examining when she had first met her Captain . " If you will wait for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your arrival . " I nodded and looked about me , impressed by it all . I thought78 THE SECRET WOMANI was going to like living in a castle . In a very short time the servant reappeared and took me up the stairs to her " ladyship . " There she was seated in her high-backed chair , a tartar , I thought , if ever I saw one and I was glad that she was not to be my patient . I knew from experience that she would be the very worst possible , but she was in perfect health and would scorn illness , thinking , I was sure that it was due to some mental weakness . I ca n't help comparing myself with Anna . She would have made an assessment of the treasures of the house , and while their obvious worth did not escape me I included them in my summing up of " grand " and concernedmyself with the people . Nursing gives one a very clear insight into people ; when they are sick and to a certain extent at one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One becomes perceptive , and the study of human beings always seemed more interesting to me than that of inanimate objects . Yet I am inclined to be frivolous  --  at least when I compare myself with serious Anna . Lady Crediton was what I call a battleaxe . She looked at me and did not entirely approve of my appearance although I was doing my best to look demure . Her appearance was entirely forbidding  --  or it would have been to anyone less experienced than I was . I thought to myself : Well , Dr. Elgin has recommended me and I 'm here and they want a nurse , so at least they 'll have to give me a chance to prove my worth . ( And I was going to prove it for I found Castle Crediton much to my taste . ) The place had appealed to me as soon as I heard of it , and when I learned that there was the possibility of working there , I was elated . Besides , I do n't want to be too far from Anna . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household . " She spoke precisely in a rather gruff masculine voice . I could understand the husband seeking consolation elsewhere . She was clearly a very worthy person , almost always right and taking care that those about her realized it . Creditable , but very uncomfortable to live with . " Yes , Lady Crediton . Dr. Elgin has given me particulars of my patient . " THE CASTLE 79Her ladyship 's mouth was a little grim , from which I gathered the patient is no favorite of hers . Or does she despise all patients because they have n't earned her obvious ruddy health ? " I am glad that he has given you some indication of how we are placed here . Captain and Mrs. Stretton have their own apartments here . The Captain is not in residence at the time , but Mrs. Stretton and her son , with their servants occupy the east wing . But although this is so , Nurse Loman , I myself am ... shall we say the Chatelaineof the Castle , and as such what happens in all parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you have any complaints , any difficulties , anything you wish to be explained  --  apart from ordinary domestic matters , of course  --  I must ask you to see me . " " Thank you , " I said . " Your patient is in a way a foreigner ; her ways may not always be like ours . You may find certain difficulties . I shall expect you to report anything unusual to me . " It was becoming rather mysterious and I must have looked puzzledfor she said : " Dr. Elgin tells me that you are extremely effi-cient . " " That was kind of him . " " You have been nursing at the Queen 's House and were involved in that unfortunate occurrence . I met Miss Brett once when I allowedher to have an escritoire for which I had no use . She gave me the impression that she was a very precise and efficient woman . " " She was , " I said . " It seems very odd , that affair . " " She changed a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lady Crediton nodded . " It was most unfortunate , Nurse Loman , and I will tell you frankly that I did consider whether I should be wise to employ someone who had been involved in such an unsavoryaffair . " She was one of those women who would call her own outspokennessfrankness and that of other people rudeness . I knew8o THE SECRET WOMANthe type . Rich old women very often who had had too much of their own way for too long . I decided to be affronted . I rose and said : " I have no wish to discountenance you , Lady Crediton . If you feel that having nursed Miss Brett you would rather I did not nurse your . . . your patient , I would not wish to remain . " " You 're hasty , " she said . " Not a good quality for a nurse . " " I must beg to contradict you . I spoke with no haste . However much I considered your remarks I should still say that if you would prefer me to go I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not preferred that you stay I should not have asked you to come here in the first place . " I bowed my head again . First round to me , I thought . " I merely want to tell you that I deplore the unpleasantness of what happened to Miss Brett and it is impossible to be involved in such unpleasantness without being connected with it . " " If one is involved one must necessarily be connected , Lady Crediton . " Oh yes , I was scoring fast ; but I sensed I was only doing so because she was trying to tell me something and did not know how to . She need not have worried . I understood . She did not like " the patient " ; there was something strange about " the patient . " Somethingwild perhaps which might involve her in some " unpleasantness . " This was growing interesting . I went on boldly : " One of the qualifications of a person in my position is discretion . I do not think Dr. Elgin would have recommendedme to this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You may find Mrs. Stretton a little . . . hysterical . Dr. Elgin will have told you what is wrong with her . " " He mentioned some lung complaint with asthma . " She nodded . And I realized that she accepted me . I thought she liked someone to stand up to her and I had done exactly that . I had her approval as the patient 's nurse . " I daresay , " she said , " that you would wish to see your patient . " I said I thought that would be desirable . THE CASTLE " Your bags . . . " " Were brought into the hall . " " They will be taken to your room . Ring the bell please , Nurse Loman . " I did so and we waited in silence for the call to be answered . " Baines , " she said when it was , " pray take Nurse Loman to Mrs.Stretton . Unless you would prefer to go first to your room , Nurse ? " " I think I should like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She inclined her head and we went out ; I could feel her eyes following me . We went through a maze of corridors and up little flights of circular stairs  --  stone some of them and worn in the middle  --  fake I thought . Stone does n't wear away in the space of fifty years . But I found it fascinating . A house pretending to be what it was not . That made it very human to my mind . Then we went into the Stretton apartments , high up in one of the towers , I guessed . " Mrs. Stretton will be resting , " said the manservant hesitantly . I said , " Take me to her . " He knocked at a door ; a muffled sulky voice said : " Who 's there ? " " It 's Nurse Loman who 's come , madam , " said the servant . There was no answer so he opened the door and I went in . In my profession we take the initiative . I said to him : " That 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venetian blinds at the windows and the slats had been set to let in the minimum of light . She was lying on the bed , thick dark hair hanging loose , in a purple robe with scarlet trimming . She looked like a tropical bird . " Mrs. Stretton ? " I said . " You are the nurse , " she said , speaking slowly . I thought : What nationality ? I hazarded some sort of half caste . Perhaps Polynesian , Creole . " Yes , come to look after you . How dark it is in here . We 'll have a little light . " I went to the nearest window and drew up the blind . She put a hand over her eyes. 82 THE SECRET WOMAN " That 's better , " I said firmly . I sat down by the bed . " I want to talk to you . " She looked at me rather sullenly . A sultry beauty she must have been when she was well . " Dr. Elgin has suggested that you need a nurse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Elgin thinks so , and we shall see , sha n't we ? " We took measure of each other . The high flush in the cheeks , the unnatural brightness of the eyes , bore out what Dr. Elgin had told me of her . She was consumptive and the attacks of asthma must be alarming when they occurred . But I was interested in her more as a person than a sick woman because she was the wife of Anna 's Captain and I wondered why he had married her and how it had all come about . I should discover in due course , I had no doubt . " It 's too cold here , " she said . " I hate the cold . " " You need fresh air . And we must watch your diet . Dr. Elgin visits you frequently , I suppose . " " Twice a week , " she said . She closed her eyes ; quiet , sullen , and yet smoldering . I was aware that she could be far from quiet . " Dr. Elgin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall have to see about getting you well , " I said in my bright nurse 's voice . She turned her face away . " Well , " I went on , " now that we 've met I 'll go to my room . I daresay it is close to yours . " " It 's the next to it . " " Ah , good . I can find my way there then without bothering anyone . " I went out of the room and into the next one . I knew it was mine because my bags were there . The shape of it indicated that it was part of the tower . I went to the window which was really a door  --  of the french window type  --  opening onto a balcony or rather a parapet . Anachronism , I thought . I must ask Anna . What a view from the parapet  --  the deep gorge and the river below and on the other side the houses of Langmouth . THE CASTLE 83I unpacked my bags and as I did so the door was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a boy of about seven . He said : " Hello . You 're a nurse . " " That 's right , " I replied . " How do you know ? " " They said so . " " Who are you ? " " I 'm Edward . " " How do you do , Edward . " I put out my hand and he shook it gravely . " Nurses come for ill people , " he told me . " And make them well , " I added . His enormous dark eyes regarded me as though I were some goddess . " You 're clever , " he said. very , " I admitted . " Can you do twice one are two ? " " Twice two are four . Twice three are six , " I told him . He laughed . " And a , b , c ? " I went through the alphabet with great speed . I had impressed him . " Are those your clothes ? " I told him they were . " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aback . " Like the furniture lady , " he added . He was sharp ; I could see that . I said quickly : " Only for making people well . " " But . . . " he began ; then he was alert . " Master Edward , " called a voice . He looked at me and hunched his shoulders ; he put his fingers to his lips . " Master Edward . " We were both silent , but he had left my door open and his governess came in . She was tall , angular , and wore a most unbecominggray blouse with a brown skirt  --  hideous combination ; her hair was gray too , so was her skin . " Oh , " she said , " you 're the new nurse . I hope Edward has not been annoying you . " 84 THE SECRET WOMAN " Entertaining me rather . " " He is really far too precocious . " She had rabbity teeth and rabbity eyes . We took an instant dislike to each other . " Come along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturb your Mamma . " " His Mamma is my patient , I believe , " I said . She nodded . " I shall soon learn my way around , " I added . " You 've just come from the Queen 's House . " Her eyes were alert . Young Edward looked from one to the other of us . " My last case was there . " " H 'm . " She looked at the child , and I thought : How gossip spread ! And thought of Anna and the horrible things which had been said about her . They were even inclined to regard me with some sort of suspicion ; how much more so they would have regardedAnna ! She sighed . She dared not talk in front of the child . I wished he was not there so I could discover more , but I had plenty of time . She took him away and while I unpacked , a parlormaid brought tea to my room . Baines came with her ostensibly to see that she served it in the correct manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken in my own room . I realized that this was an edict from Lady Crediton and that he only ventured into this part of the house to deliver such commands . I was beginning to learn something about the ways of Castle Crediton . April 3oth . This is my third day and I feel as though I have been here for months . I miss Anna . There is no one here with whom I can be friendly . If Miss Beddoes , the governess , were a different type , she might be useful , but she 's a bore , always anxious to impresson me that she has come down in the world . A vicar 's daughter , she told me . I said : " Snap . So am I. " She looked startled . I 'm sure she was surprised that one so lacking in decorum should have come out of a vicarage . " What can one do , " she demanded . " One has never been brought up to work for a living , and suddenly itTHE CASTLE 85is a necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's where I was more fortunate . I knew from my earliest days that I should have to battle for my bread in a cruel world , so I prepared myself . " " Really , " she replied with cold disdain . But she does regard me a little more kindly since we both came from similar stables , or as she would say , were " distressedgentlewomen . " She has told me quite a lot about the family , and for that I 'm grateful . She whispered that she believes there is a streak of madnessin my patient . I would call it hysteria . Mrs. Stretton is a passionatewoman deprived of a husband . I think she is obsessed by him . She writes letters to him every day and tears half of them up . Scraps of paper fill her wastepaper basket . He , Miss Beddoes , tells me , is not welcome in the house since his " disgrace . " What disgrace ? I wanted to know . But she could n't tell me . It is something which is Never Spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . But because of the child they brought Mrs. Stretton over here . " You see , " she said , " until Mr. Rex marries , that child is in a way a sort of heir . " It 's a muddled setup and I have n't quite worked it out , but I intend to . My patient takes up so much time . I cook for her because Dr. Elgin wishes her diet to be watched . She is like a child and I suspect her of getting one of the servants to smuggle chocolates to her . She likes coffee and makes it herself . There is a spirit lamp in her room for the purpose . I think if she were well she would be fat . She is indolent and likes to stay in bed , but Dr. Elgin does want her to rest . She orders the maids to shut the windows after I 've opened them . She hates what she calls the " cold , " and fresh air is an important part of the treatment . I discovered this afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister . She came to my room especially to tell me so . She wanted to say that if there was anything she could do to make me confortableshe would be pleased to do it . Great condescension from the butler 's wife . She looks after all the maids and they are quite in awe of her . Ellen must have given me a good reference . May 1st . Two exciting things happened today . I am growing more and more pleased with Castle life . There is something about this place  --  an atmosphere of tension . I 'm never quite sure of what86 THE SECRET WOMANmy hysterical patient is going to do , and I 'm constantly aware of intrigue . For instance there is what happened to the Captain to make him unwelcome here . I think that if they did n't want him here they might have left his wife where she was . He could have visited her now and then , I suppose . It is some island . She has mentioned it to me as " the Island . " I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined to retreat if one is too curious . The first adventure was my meeting with the Crediton heir . None other than Rex himself . I had settled my patient for an afternoonrest and had taken a little walk in the gardens . They are as magnificent as I expected them to be . There are four gardeners living on the estate with wives who work at the Castle . The lawns look like squares of fine green velvet ; I never see them without wishingthat I had a dress made out of them ; the herbacious borders will be dazzling later on I 'm sure . Now the big features are the lovely aubrietia and arabis  --  in mauve and white clumps growing on gray stone on the terraces , and of course Castle Crediton aubrietiaand arabis must be twice as bushy as anyone else 's . That is the first thing that occurs to me in this place : opulence . You know it 's the home of a millionaire and a first or second generation one . There is a continual straining after tradition , the Creditons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can buy . It 's different from the Henrock 's place where I nursed poor Lady Henrock  --  and very successfully for she left me five hundred pounds in her will  --  just before going to the Queen 's House . There had been Henrocks at Henrock Manor for the last five hundred years . It was shabby in places but I could see the difference . As I was inspecting the most elaborate of sundials whom should I see bearingtowards me than the heir to the millions , Rex Crediton himself . Mr. Rex , not Sir Rex ; Sir Edward was only a knight . I am sure that must be rather a sore point with her ladyship . He is of medium height and good-looking but not exactly handsome ; he has an air of assurance and yet there is something diffident about him . His clothes were immaculately tailored ; I think he must get them in Savile Row . There 'd never be anything quite like that in LangTHECASTLE 87mouth . He looked surprised to see me so I thought I would introducemyself . " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his eyebrows ; they are light and sandy , his lashes are sandy too ; he has topaz-colored eyes  --  yellow-brown ; his nose is aquiline just like Sir Edward 's on the portrait in the gallery ; his skin is very pale and his mustache has a glint of gingery gold in it . " You are very young for such a responsibility , " he said . " I am fully qualified . " " I am sure you would not have been engaged unless that had been the case . " " I am sure I should not . " He kept his eyes on my face ; I could see that he approved of my looks even if he was a little dubious about my capabilities . He asked how long I had been at the Castle and whether I was satisfied with my post . I said I was and I hoped there was no objection to my walking in the gardens . He said there was none at all and pray would I walk there whenever I wished . He would show me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been planted soon after his birth ; it was now a little forest of fir trees . There was a path through this which led right to the edge of the cliff . He led me there and examined the iron fence and said the gardeners had strict instructions to keep it in good repair . " It would need to be , " I remarked . There was a straight drop right down the gorge to the river . We stood leaning on the fence looking across at the houses on the opposite cliff over the bridge . There was a proud proprietorial look in his eyes and I thought of what Anna had told me about the Creditons bringing prosperity to Langmouth . He looked important then  --  powerful . He began to talk about Langmouthand the shipping business in such a way that he made me feel excited about it . I could see that it was his life as it must have been his father 's . I was interested in the romance of the Lady Line ; and I wanted to hear as much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready and willing but he talked impersonally about how his father had built up the business , the days of struggle and endurance. 88 THE SECRET WOMANI said it was a wonderfully romantic story  --  the building of a great business from humble beginnings . I was surprised that he should talk so freely to me on such a short acquaintance and he seemed to be too , for suddenly he changed the subject and talked of trees and garden scenery . We walked back to the sundial together and he stood beside me while we read the inscription on it . " I count only the sunny hours . " " I must try to do the same , " I said . " I hope all your hours will be sunny , Nurse . " His topaz eyes were warm and friendly . I was fully aware that he was not as cold as he liked people to believe ; and that he had taken quite a fancy to me . He went in and left me in the garden . I was sure I should see him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walled garden and even through the copse to the iron railings beyondwhich was the gorge . I was amused by the encounter and elated to find I had made an impression on him . He was rather serious , and must probably be thinking me a little frivolous because of the light way I talk , and I laugh quite frequently as I do so . It makes some people like me , but the serious one might well think me too frivolous . He was of the serious kind . I had enjoyedmeeting him anyway , because he was after all the pivot around which the household revolved  --  and not only the household ; all the power and the glory was centered on him  --  his father 's heir and now the source from which all blessings would flow when his mother was no more . I went back to the sundial . This , I said to myself , is certainly one of the hours I shall count . I looked at the watch I wore  --  made of turquoise and little rose diamonds , a present from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the sundial . My patient would soon be waking . I must return to my duties . I looked up at the turret . This was not the turret in which my patient lived ; it was the one at the extreme end of the west wing . I have very long sight and I distinctly saw a face at the window . For a few seconds the face was there and then it was gone . THE CASTLE 89Who on earth is that ? I asked myself . One of the servants ? I did n't think so . I had not been near that turret . There was so much of the Castle I had not explored . I turned away thoughtfully ; and then some impulse made me turn again and look up . There was the face again . Someone was interested enough to watch me , and rather furtively too , for no sooner had she  --  I knew it was a woman because I had caught a glimpse of a white cap on white hair  --  realized that I had seen her than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But was not everything intriguing in Castle Crediton ? But I was far more interested in my encounter with the lord of the Castle , the symbol of riches and power , than I could possibly be in a vague face at a window . May 3rd . A perfect day with a blue sky overhead . I walked in the garden but there was no sign of Rex . I had thought that he might join me there and meet me " by accident " for I believe he is quite interested in me . But of course he would be busy at those tall offices which dominate the town . I had heard from several sources of information that he had stepped into Sir Edward 's shoes and with the help of his mother ran the business . I was a little piqued . I had imagined , with a fine conceit , that he had been interested in me . When he did not appear I started to think of the face at the window and pushed Rex out of my mind . The west turret I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easy enough , Heaven knew , in the Castle ; and I could quite easily go up to the west wing and look round and if discovered imply that I had lost my way . I know that I am overcurious , but that is because I am so interested in people and it is my interest in them which makes me able to help them . Besides , I had an idea that to help nurse my patient I had to understand her and to do that I needed to discovereverything I could about her . As everything in this house concerned her , this must . Anyway toward late afternoon the sky became overcast , the bright sunshine had disappeared and it was clearly going to rain at any moment . The Castle was gloomy ; this was the time in which90 THE SECRET WOMANI could most convincingly lose my way , so I proceeded to lose it . I mounted the spiral staircase to the west turret . Judging that it would be a replica of the quarters in which I lived , I went to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had seen the face and opened the door . I was right . She was seated in a chair by the window . " I . . . beg your pardon . Why . . . " I began . She said : " You are the nurse . " " I 've come to the wrong turret , " I said . " I saw you in the garden . You saw me , did n't you ? " " Yes . " " So you came up to see me ? " " The turrets are so much alike . " " So it was a mistake . " She went on without waiting for me to reply which was fortunate . " How are you getting on with your patient ? " " I think we get on well as a nurse and patient . " " Is she very sick ? " " She is better some days than others . You know who I am . May I know your name ? " " I 'm Valerie Stretton . " " Mrs. Stretton . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I live up here now . I have my own quarters . I hardly ever see anyone . There is a staircase in the west turret down to a walled garden . It 's completely shut in . That 's why . " " You would be Mrs. Stretton 's . . . " " Mother-in-law , " she said . " Oh , the Captain 's mother . " " We 're a strangely complicated household , Nurse . " She laughed ; it was slightly defiant laughter . I noted her high color with its tinge of purple in the temple . Heart , possibly , I thought . It was very likely that she might be my patient before long . " Would you like a cup of tea , Nurse ? " " That is very kind of you . I should be delighted . " And I was THE CASTLE 91because it would give me an opportunity of going on talking to her . Like her daughter-in-law she had a spirit lamp on which she set a kettle to boil . " You 're very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I could n't hope for more comfort . Lady Crediton is very good to me . " " She 's a very good woman , I 'm sure . " She did n't notice the touch of irony in my voice . I must curb my tongue . I love words and they get out of control . I wanted to win her confidence because she was the mother of one of those two boys born almost simultaneously of the same father but by different women and under the same roof , which could have been a situation from one of Gilbert and Sullivan 's operas  --  except of course that they were never improper and this was decidedly so . I must go along and have a look at old Sir Edward 's portrait in the gallery . ' What a character he must have been ! What a pity that he was not alive today ! I was sure he would have made the Castle even more excitingthan it was . She asked me how I was getting on and if I enjoyed my work . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it trying at times . Another , I thought , who does n't like my naughty patient . I said I was used to coping with patients and did n't anticipate that my present one would be any more trying than others I had experienced . " She should never have come here , " Valerie Stretton said vehemently . " She should have stayed where she belonged . " " The climate is not good for her , I admit , " I said . " But as this is her husband 's home perhaps she prefers to be here , and happinessis one of the best of all healers . " She made the tea . " I blend it myself , " she said . " A little Indian mingled with the Earl Grey and of course the secret is to warm the pot and keep it thy ; and the water must have just come to the boil . " I listened politely to my lesson in tea-making and I wondered92 THE SECRET WOMANhow much information I should get from her . Not much I decided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been too many secrets in her own life for her to want to chatter lightly about other people 's . She must have been extraordinarily pretty when she was young . Her coloring would have been fair ; her hair was still abundant though white ; her eyes were very blue . Quite a beauty ! No wonder Sir Edward had succumbed . I sipped my tea . " You must know every part of the Castle , " I said . " I find its geography so difficult to learn . " " We should n't complain of that as it 's due to it that I owe the pleasure of this visit . " I wondered what lay behind her words . I came to the conclusion that there was a depth in her which was not apparent . What a strange life hers must have been , living here under the same roof as Lady Crediton . " Do you get many visitors ? " She shook her head . " It 's a lonely life , but I prefer it so . " I thought , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Shalott . " Rex visits me often , " she said . " Rex . You mean . . . " She nodded . " There 's only one Rex . " Her voice softened slightly . " He was always a good boy . I was nurse to them . . . both . " An even more strange situation . So she was nurse to the two boys  --  her own and her rival 's . ' What a strange household ; they seemed to create unnatural situations . Was that Sir Edward ? I decided it was . There was a trace of mischief in the old fellow . I pictured it . She would favor her own son . Anna 's Captain was a spoiled boy ; that was why he was careless of other people 's feelings , that was why he thought he could amuse himself with Anna and never allow her to suspect that he was already married to a dusky beauty across the seas . " I daresay you are longing to see Captain Stretton again . When will he return ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . affair . . . " I waited expectantly but she did not continue . " He 's always been away for long periodsTHE CASTLE 93since he first went to sea . He wanted to go to sea right from a baby almost . He must always be sailing his little boats in the pond . " " I suppose they were both interested in the sea . " " Rex was different . Rex was the clever one . Quieter too . He was the businessman . " The man , I thought , who will multiply his father 's millions . " They are both good boys , " she said , suddenly taking on the character of the old nurse . " And now that Redvers is away Rex comes and sees me and makes sure I know that he does n't forget me . " How complex people are ! I had talked to this woman for half an hour and I knew scarcely any more of her than when she was a face at the window . There was a furtiveness about her one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nurse who had loved her charges ; I imagined she would have wanted to have been fair , and knowing that naturally she would favor her own son she had tried to be equally as fond of Rex . And according to her Rex was a paragon of virtue . That was not entirelytrue , I was sure . I should not have been as interested in him if he were because he would have been so dull . He was far from that . " The boys were very different in temperament , " she told me . " Red was the adventurous one . He was always talking about the sea and reading romances about it . He imagined himself another Drake . Rex was the quiet one . He had a business head on his shoulders . He was shrewd , quick to seize an advantage right from the start and when they bartered their toys and things Rex alwayscame out best . They were so lovable , both of them . . . in their different ways . " How I should have liked to pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should never get anything from her by pressing . My only chance was to lure her to betray herself . One must never rush confidences . They are so much more revealingif they come out gradually . But she interested me as much as anyone in the house  --  except perhaps Rex . I was determined that we should become friends . I found Chanteys journal enthralling . Mine was not nearly so interesting . To read what she had written was like talking to her . She was so frank about herself that I felt my writing was stilted in comparison . The references to me and the man she called " my captain " startled me at first but then I remembered that she had said we must be absolutely frank in our journals , otherwise they were useless . I recalled my own . " April 3oth . A man called to look at the Swedish Haupt cabinet . I do n't think he was serious . I was caught in the downpour on the way back from the shop and this afternoon to my horror discovered woodworm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it at once with Mrs. Buckle . May 1st . I think we 've saved the clock . There was a letter from the bank manager who suggests I call . I feel very apprehensive about what he will say . " How very different from Chanteys account of her life I sounded so gloomy ; she was so lively . I began to ask myself whether it was the different way in which we looked at life . However the situation was melancholy . Every day I discovered that the business was more deeply in debt . After dark when I was alone in the house I would imagine Aunt Charlotte was there laughing at me , implying as she had in life : " You could n't do without me and I always told you so . " People had changed toward me ; I was aware of that . They looked at me furtively in the street when they thought I did n't notice them , and I knew they were wondering : Did she have a hand in THE CASTLE 95killing her aunt ? She inherited the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only they knew what anxieties I had inherited . I tried to remember my father during that time and that he had always told me to look my troubles right in the face and stand up to them , to remember I was a soldier 's daughter . He was right . Nothing was to be gained by pitying oneself , as I knew too well . I would see the bank manager and know the worst , and I would decide whether it was possible for me to carry on . If not ? Well , I should have to make some plan , that was all . There must be something a woman of my capabilities could do . I had a fair knowledge of antique furniture , pottery , and porcelain ; I was well educated . Surely there was some niche somewhere waiting for me . I should n't find it by being sorry for myself . I had to go out and look for it . At the moment I was in an unhappy period of my life . I was no longer young . Twenty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title of " Old Maid . " I had never been sought in marriage . John Carmel might have asked me in due course but he had certainly been quickly frightened off by Aunt Charlotte ; and as for Redvers Stretton I had behaved with the utmost naivete and had myself imagined what did not exist . I had no one but myself to blame . I must make that clear to Chantel when I next saw her . I must try to write as interestingly , as revealingly about my life as she did about hers . It was a measure of our trust in each other , and there was no doubt that writing down one 's feelings did give one a certain solace . I must stop my brief entries about Swedish cabinets and tall clocks . It was my feelings that she was interested in  --  myself  --  just as I was interested in her . It was a wonderful thing to have such a friend ; I hoped the relationship between us would always be as it was now . I became afraid that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to take a post somewhere far away . I then realized to the full what knowing her had meant to me in these difficult times . Dear Chantell How she had stood by me during those dreadful96 THE SECRET WOMANdays which had followed Aunt Charlotte 's death . Sometimes I was convinced that she had contrived to divert suspicion from me . That was a very bold thing to do ; it was what was called tampering with evidence . She was so lighthearted , so loyal in her friendship , it would n't occur to her . I must write this down . No I would n't because it was something too important to be written down . That was where I was not so frank as she was . When one started to write a journal one realized that there were certain things one kept back . . . perhaps because one did n't really admit them to oneself . But when I think of Aunt Charlotte 's death I grow cold with horror because in spite of the button which Chantel found and the belief ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have special powers , I could never believe that Aunt Charlottewould take her own life , however great the pain she was suffering . And yet it must have happened . How could it have been otherwise ? Still everyone in that house benefited from her death  --  Ellen had her legacy which was more than a legacy because it was the gateway to marriage with Mr. Orfey ; and Heaven knew Ellen had been waiting at the gate for a very long time . Mrs. Morton had been waiting too for the happy release from Aunt Charlotte 's service . And myself . . . I inherited this burden of debts and anxieties , but before Aunt Charlotte 's death I had not known they existed . No , it was as Chantel had made them believe . I might think Aunt Charlotte would never take her life , but what human being knows all about another ? I must stop thinking of Aunt Charlotte 's death ; I must face the future as my father would have done . I would go and see the bank manager ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat looking at me over the tops of his glasses , pressing the tips of his fingers together , a look of mock concern on his face . I daresay he had spoken in similar strain to people before . " It 's a matter of assets and liabilities , Miss Brett . One must balance them . And you find yourself in a very precarious position . " THE CASTLE 97He went on explaining ; he showed me figures to back up his conclusions . I was in a very difficult position indeed and I had no alternative but tu act promptly . He talked of " voluntary liquidation " which he believed , with care , could still be accomplished . In a few months ' time it might be too late . I must remember that expenses went on mounting and debts growing . He was not suggesting that I should rely entirely on his advice . He was a bank manager merely . But the business had clearly been going downhill fast . Miss Charlotte Brett had bought unwisely  --  there was no doubt about that ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise money . That was a very dangerous procedureand could not be repeated too often . He suggested that I see my solicitor . Miss Brett 's loan to the bank would have to be repaidwithin the next three months he feared , and he believed that I should go into these matters very , very carefully . It might be a wise plan to cut my losses and sell everything  --  including the house . That should settle the debts and leave me a little capital in hand . He feared it was the best I could hope for . He gave me a melancholy handshake and advised me to go home and think about it . " I 'm sure you are very sensible , Miss Brett , and will before long have made up your mind . " When I returned to the Queen 's House , Mrs. Buckle was on the point of leaving . " You look down in the dumps , miss , " she said . " I do n't know . I was saying to Buckle it 's no life for a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all alone there . I do n't reckon it 's right . All alone with them valuable things . It gives me the shivers , not that the house itself would n't do that at night . " " I 'm not afraid of the house , Mrs. Buckle . It 's . . . " But I could n't explain to her ; besides she was a gossip and would be unable to help repeating any confidence . " Well , it 's none of my affair . But I think there 's worm in that ' Epplewhite table . Not much . But it was right next to the tall clock and you know what them little devils are . " " I 'll have to look into that , Mrs. Buckle . " 98 THE SECRET WOMANShe nodded . " Well , I 'll be getting along . We 're short of beeswax . I 'll get some on the way in tomorrow . See you then , miss . " She was gone and I was alone . I went into the garden and thought of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he ever thought of it . I walked down to the river where the water crowfoot rioted among the lady's-smocks and a swarm of gnats danced above the water . I looked back at the house and thought of what the bank manager had said . Sell everything . Sell the Queen 's House . I was not sure how I felt about that . The Queen 's House had been my home for so long . It attracted me while it still repelled me , and sometimes when I suddenly realized that it was mine I thought of it furnished as it must have been before it became Aunt Charlotte 's storehouse . It would have been a charming happy house then . . . beforeso many tragic things had happened in it . My mother 's death , my father , that brief evening 's happiness when I had thought I had met someone who would change my life , the disillusion and then Aunt Charlotte 's mysterious death . I did n't want to sell the house . And yet I believed I should have to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees were covered in pink and white blossom ; and there were flowery pyramids on the horsechestnut tree near my window . I had a strong feeling for the Queen 's House . I stepped inside . I stood listening to the clocks . It was still as cluttered as in Aunt Charlotte 's day . Not many people came to the house now . Perhaps they felt embarrassed to deal with someonethey suspected of being concerned in sudden death . That night I walked all round the house , through room after room . So much valuable furniture for which I could not find profitablebuyers ! I should have to sell up and that meant selling to dealers . Anyone knew that they would only buy cheaply . But I was coming nearer and nearer to a climax . I seemed to hear my father 's voice : " Stand up to your troubles . Face them and then you 'll find the way to overcome them . " That was what I was doing and the malicious clocks were tellingTHE CASTLE 99me , " Sell , sell , sell , sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start afresh . Make a new life . . . entirely . " There 's some people , " said Ellen , " that say the Queen 's House is haunted . " " What nonsense , " I retorted . " Well , that 's what they say . It gives you the creeps . " I looked at her sharply . She had changed since Aunt Charlotte 's death . I was certain that at any moment she was going to say that she could n't continue . After all she had only stayed to " help me out " as she had explained at the time . Mr. Orfey was an exactinghusband . With the legacy , he had bought his own horse and cart and was in business on his own  --  " building up nicely , " said Ellen . But it was not so much Mr. Orfey 's growing prosperity that made Ellen chary of the Queen 's House . It was the memory of Aunt Charlotte . In a way the house was haunted for Ellen as well as for me . Ellen would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she said it gave her " the creeps . " I could see that very soon she would be giving her notice . It was a wet day and the rain had been falling steadily through the night ; the skies were overcast and the house was full of shadows even in the afternoon . Mrs. Buckle going up to the attic rooms came hurrying down to say there was a pool of water on the floor of the attic . It was coming through the roof . The roof had always been a matter for anxiety . Aunt Charlotte had had it patched up now and then but I remembered the last occasion when we were told it needed major repairs . Aunt Charlottehad said she could n't afford it . I was feeling very melancholy when Chantel arrived . How pretty she looked in her dark nurse 's cloak which set off her lovely hair to advantage ; her cheeks glowed and her eyes sparkled . " I could n't resist calling , " she told me . " Miss Beddoes drove me into the high street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was terrified that you 'd be out . " 100 THE SECRET WOMAN " Oh Chantel , it is good to see you ! " I poured out everything that had happened ; my visit to the bank manager , my fears about Ellen and the leaking roof . " My poor Anna ! What shall you do ? You must have that money your aunt left me . I ca n't imagine why she should have done such a thing . I 'd only been here such a short time . " " She quickly grew fond of you . . . as anyone would . " " You must satisfy me by taking that money back . " " You know I 'd do no such thing . " " Well , at least it 's there if you want it . What are you going to do ? " " The bank tells me I should sell up . " " Can you do that ? " " I can try . There 's the house . That should fetch something . " She nodded gravely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Anna . " " I wish I could be sure . " " Have you written it all in your journal ? " " How could I when you had it ? " " As you have mine . You must give me mine back . Things must be written when they happen , otherwise they lose their flavor . One forgets so quickly the essential feeling of the moment . " " It was wonderful reading it , Chantel . I thought I was there . " " How I wish you were ! What fun that would be . If only they wanted an antique adviser at the Castle ! " " Did anyone ever want such a thing ? " " It 's fascinating , Anna . I 'm intrigued by it . It 's not only the place which is so unusual , it 's them . " " I know . I could sense that . Has anything else happened ? " " I 've consolidated my position . I 'm getting to know them all somuch better . I 'm no longer the stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Rex ? " " Now why did you pick on him ? " " I fancied he had appealed to you rather specially . " " That 's because you 're thinking of romance . Now do you think that the heir to all those millions is going to be interested , seriously , in his sister-in-law 's nurse ? " THE CASTLE 101 " I am sure he must be interested . " " The important word is seriously . " She laughed , and I said : " Well , at least you are not thinking of him seriously . " " I 'm so frivolous , as you know . " " Not always . I shall always remember you , Chantel , at the inquest . You were n't frivolous then . " " I have my serious moments . " " I ca n't get Aunt Charlotte out of my mind . " " Stop it , " she said sternly . " You must get her out of your mind . It 's all over . It 's finished . What you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Is it very bad ? " " Very . The debts are double , treble what I thought . Aunt Charlotteseemed to lose her judgment . She bought the most unsalablethings . I shall never get half what she paid for them , and toward the end she let the debts mount up . At one time she was always so meticulous . " " Her illness changed her . It does change people . " " It certainly changed her . " " You ought to get away , Anna . This is no place for you . " " Chantel , it is sweet of you to care so much what becomes of me . " Why Anna , I look on you as my sister . " " We have not really known each other long . " " Time is not always the foundation on which friendship is built . You can know more of some people in a month than you can of others in years . All that happened here brought us together . I 'd like us to stay like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have sisters . " She grimaced . " It 's odd how one loses touch with one 's family . My sister Selina married and stayed in the village where my father had his living , Katey married a doctor and went up to Scot-land . " " And do you never see them ? " " I have n't since I nursed Lady Henrock ; you see I came straight to you and there was n't time to go home ; and it 's so far away in any case . Right up in Yorkshire . " 102 THE SECRET WOMAN " I expect they would love to see you . " " They were years older than I , grown up when I was born . I was the afterthought , they used to say . My mother grew sentimentalbefore I was born ; she took my name from an old tombstone in the graveyard beside the vicarage . Someone named Chantel was buried there . She departed this life aged twenty-four years . Chantel Spring , her name was . My mother said , If it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did . I 'm Chantel Spring Loman . At least that 's the story I heard . I never knew my mother . I killed her getting born . " " Killed her ! What an expression . You speak as though it were your fault . " " One feels a certain responsibility . " " My dear Chantel , that is quite wrong . You should get that out of your head without delay . " " Look here , " she said with a laugh , " I came to give you my advicenot ask for yours . " " Well , what is yours ? " " Do n't worry . Sell up if you have to . And then we 'll go on from there . " " You 're a comfort to me , Chantel . " Then we talked about the Castle and what had been happening up there . She was certainly excited about the place . She was like a girl in love , I thought , but with the Castle . Unless that was a blind . I was certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not seem in the least bit apprehensive , although she had said he could not possibly be serious about the nurse . I did n't want her to be hurt , as I had been . It seemed an odd coincidence that she whom I had really begun to think of as the sister I always longed to have , should become too interested in one of those brothers  --  as I was in the other  --  too interested , that was , for our comfort . I felt so much better when she had gone . I was cheered ; I felt that whatever was going to happen I could cope with it . THE CASTLE 103I longed to hear more about the Castle ; she took her journal away and said that she must " make it up " as soon as possible . I told her I was longing to read the next installment . " And you must write yours too , Anna . I want to know everything you do , everything you think , nothing held back . It 's the only way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some time before I read her journal again . In the meantimeI had come to the conclusion that I would have to sell up . I had even considered selling the house . I saw a house agent who told me that this would not be easy . It was an interesting house but no repairs had been done for years . The roof was leaking ; there was woodworm in one of the floors and dry rot on the river side . " You 're too near the river and the place is damp . Houses like this are very picturesque but they need fortunes spent on them from time to time . Do n't forget this one has been standing here for the last four hundred years . It would be folly to put the house up for sale because so much has to be spent on it you would get practicallynothing for it . " The best suggestion he could make was that I let the house for a peppercorn rent with the proviso that the tenant must keep it in good repair . This meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to see to that leaking roof , that woodwormand dry rot . " It seems a possible way out , " I said . " Believe me , " was the answer . " It 's the only way out . " So I made up my mind . I was going to sell up , pay the debts ; let the house . I should have little  --  perhaps nothing ; but I should be free of encumbrances . What I should do then had still to be decided ; but these arrangementstook so long to settle that I still had months in which to think about my future. 104 THE SECRET WOMANMeanwhile events were taking place at the Castle and of these I learned through Chantel  --  but chiefly and most vividly through her journal. 7May 9th . I went to see Anna today and heard what they are advisingher . I think it will be good for her to get away from the Queen 's House and all its associations as long as she does n't go too far and I ca n't see her now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting her to the Castle . What fun it would be if we could talk over things as they happen . Today Edith Baines came to my room to bring some medicine Dr. Elgin had left for my patient and we talked . She is very different from her sister Ellen . Very dignified  --  mistress of the maids and wife to Mr. Baines ! She regardsme as an equal which means I am treated to graciousness without condescension which is amusing , and also profitable . I believe Edith knows a great deal about the " secrets " of the Castle . She did confide in me that there would shortly be a bit of a " to-do " in the household . Lady Crediton had summoned her yesterdayand told her that she had invited the Derringhams for the first week in June . " So , " said Edith , " we shall have some fun and games , and that makes work . Mr. Baines has been told to have the ballroom floor repolished ; and I hear she 's already been seeingthe gardeners . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important people I imagine since Lady Crediton thinks so highly of them . " " In a way , " said Edith , " they 're our rivals . " Edith always implies she has a share in the Lady Line . " But all very friendly , of course . Sir Henry is a friend of Mr. Rex and of her ladyship . As a matter of fact I think Sir Henry and Lady Crediton have decided that Helena will do very well for Mr. Rex . " THE CASTLE 105 " Do very well ? " " A match . Link the businesses . That 's always a good thing . My goodness , what a power we 'd be  --  Creditons and Derringhams together . " " It all sounds reasonable , " I said . Edith raised her eyes to the ceiling : " It makes work . And some of those girls are so lazy . You 've no idea . At least we 'll get Mr. Crediton safely married . After the Captain doing what he did . " " The Captain 's a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes of . . . well , " Edith folded her arms primly . " It 's not the same is it ? After all who was his mother ? She seems like a lady , and there she is waited on hand and foot up in her turret . Jane Goodwin waits on her  --  thinks the world of her . But I mean to say who was she to start with ? Although of course she was a lady 's maid . " Edith had a close knowledge of the social hierarchy of those who served the rich . This was cozy . People like Edith were the best sort of informants . They were so righteous ; they had such a sense of family . Edith for instance would have been astonished if she were accusedof gossiping . Her respect for the family was great but so was her interest in it ; and in talking to me she was not discussing it with one of the lower servants . " I should think Mrs. Stretton was very beautiful when she was young , " I prompted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And what of Sir Edward ? " " It should have been hushed up . But . . . " Her eyes had fallen on a speck of dust on my cabinet which seemed of as great concern to her as the conduct of Sir Edward with his wife 's lady 's maid . I hastily diverted her attention from it . I did not want young Betsy whose task it was to dust my quarters to be scolded on my account . I wanted to be on pleasant terms with everyone . " Why was n't it hushed up ? " I said quickly . " My mother told me . She had a post in the household before her marriage and that was why I was taken on in the first place . Mrs. Stretton  --  as she calls herself  --  is nearly twenty years younger than her ladyship , who was married fifteen years before Mr. Rex106 THE SECRET WOMANwas born . It appears that Sir Edward believed her ladyship was barren . She was a wonderful help to him ; she understood the business ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every way but one . She could not produce a healthy child . And of course what Sir Edward wanted was a son to carry on the business . " " Naturally , he 'd want a son . " " Her ladyship had had several failures . Sir Edward was in despair . Then her ladyship was pregnant but no one thought her pregnancy would come to a satisfactory end . It never had before and she was nearly forty . The doctors were dubious and even feared for her life . It became known that Valerie Stretton was about to have a child  --  and Sir Edward admitted parentage . Sir Edward wanted a son  --  legitimate if possible  --  but he wanted a son . There were two chances of getting one and Valerie Stretton seemed the more likely one . He was always a law unto himself . He snapped his fingers at local scandal and no one dared oppose him  --  not even Lady Crediton who was furious that her lady 's maid should be kept in the house . But Sir Edward always had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that her ladyship was brought to bed only two days after Valerie Stretton had given birth . Sir Edward was wild with joy because his mistress had had a healthy boy ; he 'd got his son . And a few days later Lady Crediton'sboy was born . He 'd got two sons , but he was n't going to lose one of them . Sir Edward , they said , tried for everything and that was why he had got such a great deal . He wanted his wife and his mistress ; and what Sir Edward wanted was done . So the two boys were to be brought up in the Castle and Sir Edward doted on both of the boys , though of course he was very strict with them . He was always talking about " my sons . " Valerie Stretton 's was christened Redvers , but Lady Crediton wanted everyone to know who was the important one , so her baby was christened Rex  --  the King . Rex would inherit the business ; but Master Red would be very well looked after ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of course ; and Red was all for going away to sea and Rex was all for juggling with money . So they were different in their ways . But Rex is theTHE CASTLE ln7Crediton . I wonder Sir Edward did n't make Redvers change his name too . I 've heard that if anything should happen to Rex ... " " You mean if he died ? " I said . She looked rather shocked . Death was " anything happening "  --  I must remember that . " If anything happened to Rex , " she said firmly , " why Redvers would be the heir . " " It 's all very interesting , " I said . She admitted it . " My mother was here , you see , before the boys were born . She often talked of what happened . I remember her talking about the day the ship was launched . It was quite a to-do  --  launching the ships . Sir Edward saw that it was done in the proper way because he used to say it was good for business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had added to its power . " " Naturally , " I said soothingly . " All the ships as you know are ladies . And Lady Crediton was going to name this one . It was all arranged ; she was going to break a bottle of champagne on the side as they do , you know . They had decided to name the ship The Lucky Lady or something like that . The day before the launching there had been trouble at the Castle . Her ladyship had discovered Sir Edward 's feelings for ValerieStretton and what was going on . She was most upset . She knew his tendencies , but that it should be in the Castle . . . right under her very nose you might say . . . made her very angry . She wanted to dismiss Valerie Stretton but Sir Edward would n't hear of it . Oh yes , there was a rare to-do that day . And the next she went out to name the ship and when they all expected her to say I name this ship The Lucky Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I name this ship The Secret Woman . ' Defiance you see ! " " What a flutter that must have caused . " " The only Woman among the Ladies ! But they kept it that way . It shows you , do n't you think , the sort of woman she was . Liked her own way and got it . But this was one thing in which she did n't get it . She wanted to send Valerie Stretton away . But oh no , said Sir Edward . She stays . It was funny , too , that her ladyshiplob THE SECRET WOMANaccepted it and Valerie stayed on as the nurse . They were always cool and distant to each other . But there you are , Sir Edward was no ordinary man . " " He was like an Eastern potentate with his wives and children all under one roof . " " I would n't be knowing about that , " said Edith . " But there 's not much I do n't know about the Castle . " May 11th . I thought my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack of asthma and was gasping for her breath . I sent Betsy for Dr. Elgin and when he came he told me that I must be prepared for these attacks . They were dangerous . When she had recovered a little he gave her a sedative and he came to my sitting room ( next to my bedroom in the turret ) and talked about her . " It 's an unfortunate situation , " he said . " She would be better in a climate to which she is more accustomed . The sudden changes here affect her . The damp 's no good to her . And she has a touch of consumption , you know . Her temperament does n't help . " " She seems an unhappy woman , Doctor . " " This marriage is a bit incongruous . " " Why has she come here ? As her husband is so rarely here there does n't seem much point . " " It 's the child , of course . Until Mr. Rex Crediton produces an heir , I suppose the boy is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less . It 's entirely due to the child that she is here . " " It seems hard luck on the mother . " " It 's an unusual situation . You 've probably heard that the boy is Sir Edward 's grandson -- wrong side of the blanket though it may be . But they want family in the business and the more the merrier ; I know it was always a sore point with Sir Edward that he had only two sons . He had visualized a large family of them . It seemed to be the one thing over which he had no control and that irked him . Lady Crediton seems determined to carry out his ideas . So that is why young Edward is here to learn the shipping business with his a , b , c . " TAE CASTLE 109 " I think Mrs. Stretton is homesick . By the way where is her home ? " " It 's an island in the Pacific  --  not far from the Friendly Isles . Coralle is the name . I believe her father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fish out of water here . " " The attack last night followed a display of temper . " " That was to be expected . You must try to keep her calm . " I smiled ruefully . " She reminds me of a volcano ready to erupt at any moment . The worst possible temperament for one suffering from her complaint . " " You must try to keep her happy , Nurse . " " Her husband might do that . . . if he came home . I sense that his absence is the cause of her unhappiness . " " She married a sailor so she should expect absences . Watch her diet closely . Never let her take a heavy meal  --  small and often is the rule . " " Yes , Doctor . " " Just a glass of milk or cocoa with bread and butter for breakfast . And at eleven milk . . . with perhaps an egg . She could take the egg in the milk . With the midday meal she might take a little wine but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teaspoon of cognac in it . " " I have the diet sheet , Doctor . " " Good . If she were happy she 'd be better . These distressing attacksare the result of inner tensions . She 'll sleep it off now , and you 'll find she 'll be calm enough when she wakes . " When the doctor had left I realized how alarmed I had been . I had really thought she was going to die . I ca n't pretend that I was fond of her ; there was something quite unlovable about her ; but I thought if she died I should no longer be at the Castle . And that thought made me very concerned . But of course it is the nature of my work . I am at one place for a while and then as Edith would say " something happens " and my services are no longer required . It 's a rootless existence ; and it has been brought home to me since I came to Langmouth  --  first when I had to leave Anna and now at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far110 THE SECRET WOMANtoo fond of this Castle . I like its thick walls and the fact that it 's a fake endears me to it in a way . I think I should have liked Sir Edward . What a pity he died before I came . I have seen his son Rex several times . We seem to meet frequently  --  more frequently than could be put down to chance . I am enormously interested in him and long to know about his childhood when Valerie Stretton was his nurse , and what he thought of his half brother Redvers . I wish the Captain would come home . I am sure my poor patient would be happier if he did ; and it would be interesting to see how they all get on together . May 12th . Last night I was with my patient when she was coming out of her sedation . Tier name is Monique . Such a dignified name does not really suit her . I picture her lying on sandy beaches under palm trees gazing out at the coral reefs about the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I picture her meeting the Captainwho would have perhaps gone to this Coralle to pick up copra and fish or something like that to take back to Sydney . I imagined her with exotic red flowers in her hair . He was captivated surely and foolishly , for he married her without thinking how she would fit into Castle Crediton society . But this was pure imagination . It probably happened quite differently . As I sat beside her , she started to mutter ; I heard her say : " Red . Why ... Red ... You do n't love me . " Quite revealing for it shows that he is constantly in her thoughts . Suddenly she said : " Are you there , Nurse ? " " Yes , " I soothed . " Try to rest . It 's what the doctor wants . " She closed her eyes obediently . She was really beautiful  --  rather like a doll with her thick black hair and long dark lashes ; her skin looked honey yellow against the white of her nightdress ; her brow was low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't have been more than twenty-five now . She was murmuring to herself and I bent over to listen . " He does not want to come back , " she said . " He wishes it had not happened . He wishes to be free . " THE CASTLE 111Well , madam , I thought , I do n't wonder at it if you get into tempers like you did a short while ago . She was wild , passionate , and uncontrolled . What would Lady Crediton think of such a creature ? One thing she would be pleased about . If one of the brothers had to make such a faux pas at least it was n't her precious son . I could imagine her fury if the importantRex made a m6salliance . What would she do ? Had she the power to do anything ? No doubt she had an interest in the Company ; she would most certainly be a very important shareholder . There were so many interesting things to be learned in the Castle ; more interesting in fact than the matrimonial troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to nurse . May isth . I heard today that the Captain is on his way home and should arrive in four weeks ' time . It was Edward who told me . We have become friends ; I must say I find him a bright little fellow and I pity him left to the care of the prim Miss Beddoes . She is the most unimaginative woman imaginable and Edward is really rather a naughty little boy where she is concerned . The other day she brought him in from his walk in the grounds dripping with water . He had decided to take a bath fully dressed in the fountain , he said . She was quite distracted and he only laughed when she scolded him . It is her own fault in a way ; she is so lacking in confidencethat the shrewd child senses this and makes the most of it . He knows that he has to do what I tell him or go . But I suppose it is easy for me as I am not in control of him . He quite clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of his Mamma in the same way as poor Miss Beddoes is in charge of him ; and to be in authority over a grown-up person makes me very important in his eyes . He comes into his mother 's room and watches me give her medicine . I have a little kitchen where I prepare her food and he watches me do that . He likes to have what he calls " tasters " from Mamma 's plate . Miss Beddoes frowns on this ; she says it is eating between his meals and spoils his appetite ; and as in the case of most young people the more this is forbidden the more it is to his taste . He is a lonely little boy in some respects . He is so112 THE SECRET WOMANsmall ; the Castle is so big and his mother has no idea how to treat a child . Sometimes she spoils him and wants to fondle him ; at others she loses her temper with him and has no time for him . He is not fond of her , I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lady Crediton ; but he is fond of Grandmamma Stretton , and goes to see her every day but Jane wo n't let him stay long because she said he tires her mistress . It 's small wonder that he has become attached to me . I am , I suppose , predictable ; my attitude is unchanging . I never fuss over him ; in fact I take little notice of him ; but we like each other . So he came in this morning while I was preparing his mother 's mid-morning milk and cutting her bread and butter . He sat down watching me , swinging his legs . I knew he had some exciting news to tell and that he was wondering how best to startle me with it . He could not keep it to himself : " My Papa is coming home . " " Well , are you pleased ? " He regarded the tip of his shoe shyly . " Yes , " he said . Then : " Are you ? " " I sha n't know yet . " " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps . " " And will you like him ? " " I daresay that will depend on whether he likes me . " For some reason that seemed to amuse him ; for he laughed aloud , but perhaps that was with pleasure . " He likes ships and the sea and sailors and me . . . " " That sounds like a song , " I said . I began to sing : " He likes ships and the seaAnd sailors and me . " He looked at me with great admiration . " I know something else you like , " I said . " What ? What ? " " Bread and butter . " THE CASTLE 113I put a slice on a plate and gave it to him . While he was eating it Miss Beddoes came in looking for him . She knew well enough to come straight to my room when he was missing . Seeing her he crammed the bread and butter into his mouth . " Edward ! " she cried angrily . " He 'll choke , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's no right to come in here ... eating between meals . " She was criticizing me really , not him . I just ignored her and went on cutting the bread and butter . Edward was taken away . At the door he turned and looked at me . He looked as if he was going to cry so I winked which made him laugh . It always did and he would pull his face into all sorts of contortions to try to wink back . It was flouting authority of course and wrong of me , but it stopped his tears  --  and after all he was a lonely little fellow . When I took the tray in Monique was sitting up in bed in a lacy bedjacket looking at herself in a hand-mirror . She had heard the news evidently . What a difference in a woman ! She was quite beautiful now . She frowned at the tray though . " I do n't want that . " " Oh come , " I said , " you 'll have to be well for when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Your son has just informed me . " " Trust you ! " she said . " You know everything . " " Not everything , " I said modestly . " But at least I know what 's good for you . " I smiled my bright nurse 's smile . I was pleased that at last he was coming home . May 18th . It seems incredible that I have been here such a short time . I feel I know them all so well . Lady Crediton sent for me yesterday afternoon . She wanted a report on my patient . I told her that Mrs. Stretton seemed to be progressing favorably and114 THE SECRET WOMANthere was no doubt that the new diet Dr. Elgin had worked out for her was having a beneficial effect . " You are quite comfortable , Nurse ? " she asked me . " Very comfortable , thank you , Lady Crediton . " " Master Edward has a cold . I understand that he went fully clothed into the fountain the other day . " I wondered who her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting to Baines and Baines carrying the news to Lady Crediton . Perhaps our misdeeds were all recorded and presented to our employer . " He is very healthy and will soon be well . I think a day or so confined to his bedroom and he will be perfectly well again . " " I will speak to Miss Beddoes . She really should have more control . Do you think Dr. Elgin should look at him when he calls , Nurse ? " I said I thought he might do that but it was not necessary to call him specially . She inclined her head . " Mrs. Stretton has had no more unfortunate attacks ? " " No . Her health has improved since the news came that her husband is on his way home . " Lady Crediton 's lips hardened . I wondered what she felt about Redvers . I should know when he returned . " The Captain will not be home until after our house party . I must ask you to take special care of your patient , Nurse . It would be most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I shall do my best to keep her well . " The interview was over . I felt a little shaken . I am not easily overawed ; but there was something snakelike about the woman 's eyes . I pictured her smashing the champagne bottle with venom against the side of the ship and saying in a firm voice : " I name this ship The Secret Woman . " How she must have hated having that woman in the house all those years ! And what a power Sir Edward must have been ! No wonder the Castle was such an excitingplace ! What emotions must have circulated within its walls ! I wonder Lady Crediton did n't push her rival over one of theTHE CASTLE 115parapets or Valerie Stretton did n't put arsenic in her ladyship 's food . There must have been ample provocation . And now they still lived under the same roof ; Valerie Stretton had lost her protectinglover ; and I supposed that all passions were spent . They were merely two old ladies who had reached the age when the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any case , I thought , I should not like to offend Lady Creditors . There was no fear of my doing that at the moment . She was clearly quite pleased with me . I fancied she was less so with Miss Beddoes who even as I left the presence was making her trembling way toward it . I walked out into the gardens . Rex was there . He said : " You seem to enjoy our gardens , Nurse Loman . I believe you find them beautiful . " " I find them appropriate , " I replied . He raised his eyebrows and I went on : " Worthy of the Castle itself . " " You are amused by us and our ways , Nurse Loman ? " " Perhaps , " I retaliated , " I am too easily amused . " " It is a great gift . Life becomes so much more tolerable when it amuses . " " I have always found it very tolerable . " He laughed . " If we amuse you , " he said , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should hate to bore you or make you melancholy . " " I could not imagine that to be possible . " " I feel I should sweep a curtsy and say : Thank you , fair sir . " ' " You 're different from so many young ladies I meet . " " I daresay . I work for my living . " " You are certainly a most useful member of the community . How pleasant to be both useful and decorative . " " It is certainly pleasant to hear oneself so described . " " Nurse Loman sounds a little stern . It does n't fit you . I shouldlike to think of you as something other than Nurse Loman . " " You are asking my Christian name , I presume . It is Chantel . " " Chantel . How unusual ... and how delightful . " " And more suited to me than Nurse ' ? " 116 THE SECRET WOMAN " Infinitely more . " " Chantel Spring Loman , " I told him and he wanted to know how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother 's seeingit on the tombstone and he seemed to find that very interesting . He took me along to the greenhouses and he talked to the gardeners about the blooms which would be brought into the house during the period of the house party . He asked my advice and I gave it freely . It was flattering that he passed it on to the gardeners and said " This shall be done . " May zxst . There has been drama in the house these last two days . I think it had begun before I realized it . I noticed that Jane Goodwin , Valerie Stretton 's maid , was worried . I asked her if she were feeling well . " I 'm quite all right , Nurse , " she said . " I thought you looked ... anxious . " " Oh no , no , " she said , and hurried away . So I knew that something was wrong . I kept thinking about what went on in the west turret and wondering how Valerie felt about her son 's return . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From all accounts he was such a fascinating fellow . His wife was madly in love with him and my dear cool Anna had been ready to fall in love with him , so surely his mother should be happy by his return . I had quickly summed up Jane as being one of those women made to serve others . I doubted she had ever had a life of her own ; the center of her existence would be her mistress and friend , in this case Valerie Stretton . So if Jane were anxious I guessed something was amiss with Valerie . It was about nine o'clock in the evening . I had given Monique her food and was reading when Jane knocked at my door . THE CASTLE 117 " Oh , Nurse , " she said , " do come quickly . It 's Mrs. Stretton . " I hurried to the west turret to find Valerie Stretton lying on her bed and distorted with pain . I thought I knew what was wrong and that it was what I had suspected . I turned to Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jane ran off . There was nothing I could do . I believed it was an attack of angina and had thought " Heart " as soon as I set eyes on her . I bent over her . " It 'll soon pass . It 's passing now , I believe . " She did not speak but I think she was comforted to have me there . What startled me was the manner in which she was dressed . She wore high boots ; the mud on them had stained the counterpane and her hat had half-fallen from her head . What I noticed particularly was the heavy veil which would have concealedher face . She had been out . I would not have believed that possible if I had not seen her boots and the hat . Why had she gone out dressed like that at that time of the evening ? The pain was passing . Such an attack would last about half an hour , and I knew that this was not a major attack . But it was a warning . Without disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took her hat off , but I did not take her coat from her as I did not wish to move her until the doctor had been . When he came the attack was over . He examined her and I gently undressed her . She was too exhausted to tell him much but I described what I had seen and he looked grave . She was to rest , he said ; he wanted her to sleep . He came into my sitting room afterward . " Very grave , is it , Doctor ? " He nodded . " Angina pectoris undoubtedly . I 'm glad you 're here , Nurse . That 's if you 're prepared to take on another patient . " " I certainly am . " " I just want you to watch her very carefully . There must be the minimum of exertion ; fatigue and anxiety must be avoided , excite-118 THE SECRET WOMANment too . And of course her diet must be watched . She must eat sparingly . You 've probably nursed this sort of case before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart . " " Good . Now , there may not be another attack for weeks , months ... or even longer . On the other hand she could have another within the hour . Give her a little brandy if there is any sign of another attack . I 'll send up some nitrite of amyl . You know how to use it ? " " Five drops on a handkerchief inhaled ? " He nodded . " Was she alone when this happened ? " " No . Jane Goodwin was with her . She had just come in , though . " " Ah , she had walked too far . She must be careful in future . She should always have close at hand a piece of cotton wool soaked with nitrite of amyl . There 's a special bottle I can give you ; it has a particularly tight stopper . Put the five drops on the cotton wool and the wool into the bottle ; then if she feels an attack coming on and is alone she can have it all ready for use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either you or Jane Goodwin will be at hand . Jane seems a sensible young woman . " I said I was sure she was . " All right , I 'll go and see Lady Crediton and tell her the state of affairs . She should be grateful that you 're installed in the house , Nurse . " Lady Crediton , if not exactly grateful , because she would never be that to someone she paid , at least found it most convenient ( her word ) that I should be there . " Dr. Elgin tells me that you will keep an eye on Mrs. Stretton , Senior , " she said , making it seem the lightest of duties . " I understand that she has a bad heart . " Her nose was lifted with disapproval , as though she was saying : " How typical of such a woman to have a bad heart at such a time ! " I thought she was as hard as the nails which were driven into the Company 's " ladies " ( if they do drive nails in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see her fierce and implacable ; and I wondered afresh how such a woman could ever have toleratedthat situation which Sir Edward had put her into . It onlyTHE CASTLE 119went to show what a man of iron he must have been . And then suddenly it occurred to me that it was the Shipping Line she loved . It was Big Business , the acquisition of money . Sir Edward and she had been partners not only in marriage but in business ; and if the marriage failed her , she was determined that the business never would . May 24th . There is that feeling in the air which suggests that we are moving toward some climax . I believe it is the house party which will begin on the first of June . Such activities there are throughout the Castle ! Baines importantly struts ( there 's no other word for it ) around , investigating the wine cellar , instructing the maids and informing the footmen what will be expected of them . This visit of the Derringhams is going to be important . I fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't relish the fair Helena Derringham . Ironical that she should be called Helena . Though Helen would have been more apt . I said something to him about the face that launched a thousand ships and he smiled a little perfunctorily , as though it were too serious a matter ( or perhaps too melancholy a one ) over which to joke . I gather that the matchmaking is Lady Crediton 's doing . She will expect Rex to marry where she wishes . Poor Rex ! I feel this will be something of a test for him . He has met Helena at dances when she came out two years ago , and I gather he was not exactly stunned by her charms . But of course her ladyship has a controlling interest in the business . This slipped out , too . Sir Edward left everything in her hands . He must have had a great respect for her business acumen  --  and I 'm sure he was not a man to be mistaken . I understood that it could be very uncomfortable for Rex if he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could leave her share away from Rex if he displeased her . To the Captain ? I wondered . No , that was something she would never do , I am sure . She bitterly resents Red having any shares at all ; but he has a small holding ; Sir Edward had left that to him and of course he would always be one of the Company 's Captains . I was surprised that Rex should confide in me . But we had a rather special friendship  --  rather like the one I120 THE SECRET WOMANhad with young Edward , perhaps . They found me different from the people they usually met . Besides , the people at the Castle do behave rather unconventionally . May 25th . My original patient is much better . She blossoms . It is the thought of the husband 's return rather than my nursing , I 'm sure . But it 's always so with that type of patient . I have difficulty though in making her rest and keep to her diet . Oddly enough when she 's excited she wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her dresses  --  all in gay colors . She favors a flowered robe , loose and shapeless and split almost up to the knee . She looks as Edith said disapprovingly , " foreign . " Yesterday afternoonshe flew into a temper because she could n't find the sash she wanted . I thought she was going to have an attack  --  but we avoided that . My other patient is much more sick and I have been spending a great deal of time with her . Jane welcomes me because I think she feels I know how to treat her mistress . I asked Valerie Stretton yesterday if she had walked very far on the day she had had the attack . " Yes , quite far , " she said cautiously . " Farther than usual ? " " Yes , much farther . " " You usually walk in the grounds , do n't you ? " " Yes , I do , but ... " She was plucking at the bed coverlet and I thought I had better change the subject because this was exciting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked myself , which had brought on the attack or was it due to some anxiety ? I discovered that she had had vague warnings before in the form of slight pains in the arms and chest . They had passed within a few minutes though and she had thought of them vaguely as some sort of rheumatism . I said : " The thing is to avoid too much exercise . You must never overtire yourself . But I think anxiety would probably be more dangerousthan anything else . " Again that look of fear . THE CASTLE 121When I left her it was with the certainty that she had something on her mind . I wondered what , and being myself I knew I should not be happy until I found out . June 6th . I have not had time to write in my journal for nearly a fortnight , and that is not surprising . Such excitement we have had in the Castle and it is due of course to the Derringhams ' visit . They arrived on the 1st  --  a lovely summer 's day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in a fever of excitement and the lawns and the flower beds were certainly at their best . The scent of pinks filled the air and the fountain-lawn marques had been set up for the garden party which was to be the first what Edith would call " to-do . " I was longing for a glimpse of the fair Helena and when I saw her I knew why Rex was melancholy . I am sure she was a young woman who was full of virtues , but she was not exactly an attractive one . She was awkward , with large hands and feet , and walked like a woman who spends a great deal of time in the saddle  --  which I 'm sure she did . In fact her face was rather the shape of a horse 's ; her laughter had an equine quality too ; she neighed , one might say . She talked in a loud and piercing voice ; she was a character . I wondered whether Lady Crediton had looked rather like her in her youth and then it occurred to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure Rex was feeling now . But Sir Edward would do his duty . And there was no doubt that Lady Crediton heartily approved of Miss Derringham . How could she help it when she considered the Derringham million or so  --  and Sir Henry had no son . Moreover he doted on his daughter . I was glad that some people admired her for I had a notion that Rex was not being the attentive squire his mother and Helena 's father expected him to be . I was at the window watching the guests on the lawn . It was a perfect day . Even the weather had to toe the line for Lady Crediton , it seemed . The grass was even more soft and velvety than usual , and the colored dresses , the big shady hats and parasols made an enchanting picture accentuated by the dark clothes of122 THE SECRET WOMANthe men . I longed to be down there among them . I pictured the dress I should wear  --  green as the grass and my hair should be piled high . Perhaps I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more , and a parasol that was a mass of green and white frills like the one I most admired down there . If I had the clothes I would go down and mingle with the guests and I would be as beautiful and amusing as any of them  --  and no one would know that I was merely the nurse . " Stop it , Cinderella Loman , " I said to myself . " It 's no use your looking round for a fairy godmother with a magic wand and pumpkin . You ought to have learned by now that you have to be your own fairy godmother . " Monique had gone to the party . She insisted . She looked strange among those elegantly dressed women . Monique would never be elegant , only colorful . I imagined that Lady Crediton would not wish her to be there . How tiresome of her , she would think , to be well enough to attend the garden party when on almost all other occasions she was so ill that Dr. Elgin had suggested they employ a nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of him . He was quite fond of Redvers so I supposed he thought he should be kind to his wife . I went along to see my other patient and I found her sitting at her turret window looking down on the scene . " How are you today ? " I asked , sitting beside her . " I 'm very well , thank you , Nurse . " It was n't true , of course . " It 's colorful , " I said . " Some of the ladies ' dresses are really beautiful . " " I see Miss Derringham . . . in blue there . " I had a good look at her . It was the wrong shade of blue  --  too light ; it made her fresh color look crude . " There are hopes , I believe , that an announcement will be madeduring the visit , " I said , because I could never curb my curiosityenough to resist bringing up the subjects I wanted to talk about . " It 's almost a certainty , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept ? " " But of course . " She looked surprised that I could suggest anyone could possibly refuse Rex . I remembered that she had been his nurse and would have loved him as a small boy . " It will be an excellent thing to link the two companies which is what will happen naturally . It will certainly be one of the biggestcompanies in the Kingdom then . " " Very good , " I said . " She 'll be lucky . Rex was always a good boy . He deserves his good fortune . He 's worked hard . Sir Edward would be proud of him . " " So you are hoping this marriage will take place . " She seemed surprised that I should imply there was an element of doubt . " Yes , it will make up for Red 's marriage . That is a disaster . " " Well , perhaps not entirely so . Young Edward is a charming child . " She smiled indulgently . " He 's going to be just like his father . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she would give little away . There was a definite air of wariness about her . I suppose it was natural considering her past . I remember my sister Selina 's calling me the Inquisitor because she said I was completely ruthless when I was trying to prise information out of people who did n't want to give it . I must curb my inquisitiveness . But , I assured myself , it was necessary for me to know what was in my patient 's mind ; I had to save her from exerting herself , worrying about anything  --  and how could I do that unless I knew what she was troubled about . Then Jane came in with a letter for her mistress . Valerie took the letter and as her eyes fell on the envelope I saw her face turn a grayish color . I went on talking to her , pretending not to notice , but I was fully aware that she was paying little attention to what I was saying . She was a woman under strain . Something was bothering her . I wished I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone and I could not ignore the hint she gave me ; so I left her . Ten minutes later Jane was calling me . I went back to Valerie and gave her the nitrite of amyl . It worked like a miracle and we staved off the attack while it was merely an iron vise on her arms and was over before it reached the chest and the complete agony . I said there was no need to call Dr. Elgin ; he would be looking in the next day . And I thought to myself : It was something in that letter that upset her . The next day a most unpleasant incident occurred . I disliked the Beddoes woman right from the start , and it seems she felt similarly about me . Valerie was feeling so much better that she was taken a short walk in the garden with Jane , and I was in her room making her bed with the special bedrest Dr. Elgin had suggested to prop her up when her breathing was difficult . The drawer of her table was half-open and I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking it out and looking at it . There were several photographs in it  --  mostly of the boys . Underneatheach was lovingly inscribed : Redvers aged two ; Rex two and a half . There was a picture of them together and again with her . She was very , very pretty in those days , but she looked a little harassed . She was obviously trying to make Redvers look where the photographers wanted him to . Rex stood leaning against her knee . It was rather charming . I was sure she loved them both dearly ; I could tell by the way she spoke of them and I imagined her tryingnot to show favoritism to her own son ; they were both Sir Edward'schildren anyway . I put the album back and as I did so I saw an envelope . I immediatelythought of what had upset her and wondered if this was the letter ; I could n't be sure because it was an ordinary white envelope like so many . I picked it up . I was holding it in my hand when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sly rather whining voice said : " I 'm looking for Edward . Is he here ? " I swung round holding the letter and I was furious with myself because I knew I looked guilty . The fact was I had n't looked insideTHE CASTLE 125the envelope . I had only picked it up and I could see by her expression that she thought she had caught me red-handed . I put the envelope back on the table as nonchalantly as I could and I said calmly that I thought Edward was in the garden . He was probably walking with his grandmother and Jane . I felt furious with her . I shall never forget the night of the fancy dress ball . I was very daring , but then I always had been . It was Monique oddly enough who goaded me to it . I fancied she was becoming rather fond of me ; perhaps she recognized in me something of a rebel like herself . I encouraged her to confide in me because my policy was that the more I knew about my patients the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house where she had lived with her mother on the Island of Coralle . It sounded like a queer , shabby old mansion near the sugar plantation which her father had owned . He was dead and they had sold it now but her mother still lived in the house . As she talked she gave me an impression of lazy steamy heat . She told me how as a child she used to go down to watch the big ships come in and how the natives used to dance and sing to welcome them and to say goodbye . The great days were when the ships arrived and the stalls were set up on the waterfront with the beads and images , grass skirts and slippers , and baskets which they had made in readiness to sell to the visitors to the island . Her eyes sparkled as she talked and I said : " You miss it all . " She admitted she did . And talking she began to cough ; I thought then : She would be better back there . She was childish in lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure in one moment of abandoned laughter whether she would be on the edge of melancholy in the next . There was no contact whatever between her and Lady Crediton ; she was much happier with Valerie , but then Valerie was a much more comfortable person . She would have liked to go to the fancy dress ball but she had had an asthmatical attack that morning and even she knew it would be folly . " How would you dress ? " I asked her . She said she thought she126 THE SECRET WOMANwould go as what she was , a Coralle islander . She had some lovely coral beads and she would wear flowers in her hair which would be loose about her shoulders . " You would look magnificent , I 'm sure , " I told her . " But everyonewould know who you were . " She agreed , and said : " How would you go . . . if you could go ? " " It would depend on what I could find to wear . " She showed me the masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big alabaster bowl in the hall and brought them to her . He had come in wearing one crying " Guess who this is , Mamma . " " I did not have to guess , " she added . " Nor would anyone have to if you went as you suggest , " I remindedher . " You would be betrayed at once and the whole point is to disguise your identity . " " I should like to see you dressed up , Nurse . You could go as a nurse perhaps . " " It would be the same thing as your going with your coral beads and flowing hair . I should be recognized immediately and drummed out as an imposter . " She laughed immoderately . " You make me laugh , Nurse . " " Well , it 's better than making you cry . " I was taken with the idea of dressing up . " I wonder how I could go ? " I asked . " Would n't it be fun if I could so completely disguisemyself that that were possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and I put it on . " Now you look wicked . " " Wicked ? " " Like a temptress . " " Rather different from my usual role . " I looked at myself in the glass and a great excitement possessed me . She sat up in bed and said : " Yes , Nurse . Yes ? " " If you had a dress that I could wear ... " " You would go as an island girl ? " I opened the door of her wardrobe ; I knew that she had some exotic clothes . She had bought them on the way home from Coralle at some of the eastern ports at which they had stopped . ThereTHE CASTLE 127was a robe of green and gold . I slipped out of my working dress and put it on . She clapped her hands . " It suits you , Nurse . " I pulled the pins out of my hair and it fell about my shoulders . " Nurse , you are beautiful , " she cried . " Your hair is red in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't look so much like the nurse now , doI ? " " They will not recognize you . " I looked at her startled . I knew that I was going down there ; but I was surprised that she did . I looked round the room . " Take anything . . . anything , " she cried . I found a pair of golden slippers . " I bought those on my way over , " she added . They were loose but that did not matter . They matched the green and gold robe perfectly . " But what am I supposed to represent ? " I picked up a piece of thin cardboard which Edward used for his drawing lessons  --  he had brought his latest picture in to show her  --  and twisted it into the shape of a steeple hat . " I have an idea , " I said . I took a needle and thread and in a moment I had my steeple hat . Then I took one of her sashes  --  a gold colored chiffon  --  and I draped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cascades . She was sitting up in bed rocking on her heels . " Put on the mask , Nurse . No one will know you . " But I had not quite finished . I had seen a silver chain girdle which she often wore about her negligee so I put it round my waist and picking up a bunch of keys which were lying on the dressing table I attached them to the girdle . " Behold the Chatelaine of the Castle ! " I said . " The Chatelaine ? " she asked . " What is this ? " " The lady of the house . The one who guards the keys . " " Ah , that becomes you . " I put on the mask . " Will you dare ? " she said . There was a recklessness in me . Selina had noticed it and warned me about it . Of course I was going. 128 THE SECRET WOMANWhat a night it was  --  one I am sure I shall never forget . I was down there , among them ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wild excitement grip me . Selina had said that I ought to be an actress ; and I certainly acted that night . It was scarcely acting  --  I really felt that I was the Chatelaine of the Castle , that I was the hostess and these were my guests ; I was quickly seized by a partner . I danced , resisted his attempts to discover my identity and joined in the game of mild flirtation which seemed to be the purposeof the affair . I wondered how Rex was getting on with Helena Derringham . I could be certain that if he saw through her disguise he would do his best to avoid her . It was almost inevitable that he should discover me in time . I was dancing with a portly Restoration nobleman when I was seized and wrested from him . Laughing I looked into the masked face and knew that my troubadour was Rex . I thought : If I know him will he know me ? But I flattered myself that I was more completely disguised . Besides , I was expecting to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sorry for the rough treatment , " he said . " I think a serenade first of all would have been more appropri-ate . " " An irresistible urge possessed me , " he said . " It was the color of your hair . It 's most unusual . " " I shall expect you to make a ballad about it . " " I wo n't disappoint you . But I thought we should be together  --  after all we belong . " " Belong ? " I said . " Just about the same period . The medieval lady . . . the Chatelaineof the Castle and the humble troubadour who waits outside to sing of his devotion . " " This troubadour seems to have found his way into the Castle . " He said : " You might have come as a nurse . " " Why ? " I asked . " You would have played the part to perfection . " " You might have come as the shipping lord . How would thatTHE CASTLE 129he , I wonder ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your neck . " " I see , " he said , " that there is no need to introduce ourselves . Did you really think I should n't know you ? No one else has hair that color . " " So it was my hair which betrayed mel And what are you going to do ? Dismiss me . . . in due course ? " " I reserve judgment . " " Then perhaps you will allow me to retire gracefully . Tomorrow morning I shall expect to receive a summons from her ladyship . ' Nurse , I have just heard of your most inconvenient conduct . Pray leave at once : " " And what of your patients if you deserted them in that cruel way ? " " I should never desert them . " " I should hope not , " he said . " Well , now you have caught me red-handed , as they say , there is nothing more to be said . " " I think there is a great deal to be said . I do apologize for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters been left to me ... " I pretended to be relieved , but I had known all along that he was pleased I was here . So we danced and we bantered together , and he stayed with me . It was pleasant and I know he thought so , too . But if he had forgotten Miss Derringham , I had not . In my impulsive way I asked if he knew what she was wearing . He said he had not inquired . And is there to be an announcement ? I wanted to know . He replied that it certainly would n't be tonight . The Derringhamswere leaving on the seventh and on the night of the sixth there was to be a very grand ball . This would be more ceremonious than tonight . " Opportunities will not be given to intruders ? " I asked . " I 'm afraid not . " " The announcement will be made , toasts will be drunk ; there 'll be feasting probably in the servants ' hall ; and those neither below130 THE SECRET WOMANstairs nor quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Beddoes  --  perhaps even may be allowed to enter into the general rejoicing . " " I daresay . " " May I say now , that I wish you all the happiness you deserve . " " How do you know that I deserve any ? " " I do n't . I wish that if you deserve it you may have it . " He was laughing . He said : " I enjoy so much being with you . " " Then perhaps my sins are forgiven ? " " It depends on what you have committed . " " Well  --  tonight for instance . I am the uninvited guest . The Chatelaine with false keys . . . and not even an invitation card . " " I told you I am pleased you came . " " Did you tell me that ? " " If I did not I tell you now . " " Ah , Sir Troubadour , " I said , " let us dance . And have you seen the time ? I suppose they will unmask at midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the Chatelaine has turned into Cinderella ? " " To be turned at midnight into the humble serving wench . " " I have never yet been aware of your humility  --  although I admityou have many more interesting qualities . " " Who cares ? I have always suspected the humble . Come , sir . You are not dancing . This music inspires me so and I have not much longer . " And we danced and I knew that he was reluctant for me to leave . But I left a full twenty minutes before midnight . I had no intention of being discovered by Lady Crediton . Besides , I rememberedMonique would no doubt be waiting to hear what had happened . I could never be sure what she would do . She might suddenly decide to see for herself . I pictured her coming down and looking for me and perhaps betraying me . She was awake when I got up to her room and inclined to be sullen . Where had I been all this time ? She had felt so breathless ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was n't it myTHE CASTLE 131place to be with her ? She had thought I would just go down and come straight back . " What would have been the good of that ? " I demanded . " I had to show you that I could deceive them all . " She was immediately restored to good humor . I described the dancers , the plump Restoration knight who had flirted with me ; I imitated him and invented dialogue between us . I danced about the room in my costume , reluctant to take it off . " Oh , Nurse , " she said , " you 're not in the least like a nurse . " " Not tonight , " I said . " I 'm the Chatelaine of the Castle . TomorrowI shall be the stern nurse . You 'll see . " She became hysterical laughing at me ; and I became rather alarmed . I gave her an opium pill and taking off my costume , I put on my nursing dress and sat by her bed until she slept , Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . I could hear the strains of music still . They would have unmasked ; and were dancing again . Poor Rex , I thought maliciously . He would n't be able to evade Miss Derringham now . June 7th . There is a strange flat feeling throughout the Castle . The Derringhams are leaving . Last night was the great finale , the great ceremonial ball . Everyone is talking about it . Edith came into my room on a pretext of inspecting Betsy 's work but actually to talk to me . " It 's very surprising , " she said . " There was no announcement . Mr. Baines had made all the arrangements . We were going to celebrate in the servants ' hall naturally . They would expect tt . And there was simply no announcement . " " How very odd ! " I said . " Her ladyship is furious . She has n't spoken to Mr. Rex yet . But she will . As for Sir Henry he is very annoyed . He did not give Mr. Baines the usual appreciation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised me a new gown because he was sure that after the announcement Sir Henry would be more generousthan usual . " 132 THE SECRET WOMAN " What a shame ! And what does it mean ? " Edith came close to me . " It means that Mr. Rex did not come up to scratch as the saying goes . He just let the ball go by without asking Miss Derringham . It is most odd because everyone was expecting it . " " It just goes to show , " I said , " that no one should ever be too sure of anything . " With that Edith heartily agreed . June 9th . Lady Crediton is clearly very upset . There have been " scenes " between her and Rex . The acrimonious exchanges betweenmother and son could not go entirely unheard by one or other of the servants and I gathered that there must have been some lively conversation behind the green baize door and at that table presided over with the utmost decorum by Baines at one end and Edith at the other . Edith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averse to imparting it to me . I was very interested and rather sorry that my special status in the household prevented my joining those very entertaining meals when the conversation must have been so lively  --  I am sure it made up for the celebrationthey missed . " My word , " said Edith , " her ladyship is in a nice paddy . She reminds him what he owes to her . You see Sir Edward had a very high opinion of her and she still has a business head on her shoulders . She 's the one who always has to have the last say in all businessmatters . And if she could n't cut him off with a shilling  --  as the saying goes  --  she could divert a big proportion of the shares . That was her word , divert . ' Mr. Baines heard it distinctly . " " To whom I wonder would she divert . To Captain Stretton ? " " Never ! She could tie things up in some sort of trust . . . perhaps for Mr. Rex 's children if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't have all that much say in things after she 'd gone . No more than he has now . Her ladyship is in a fine paddy , I can tell you . " " And Mr. Rex ? " THE CASTLE 133 " He keeps saying he wants time . He does n't want to rush into anything and all that . " " So he has n't definitely decided against the marriage . " " No . It 's just that he has n't committed himself . He 'll come to it . " " Can you be sure of that ? " " Oh yes , it 's what her ladyship wants and she always gets what she wants . " " She did n't . . . once . " Edith looked surprised and I pretended to be embarrassed . " Well , it 's common knowledge , " I went on . " I was thinking of how put out she must have been about the Captain and Mrs. Stretton ... but she had to accept that . " " Ah , that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . But there 's no Sir Edward now , is there ? And her ladyship has taken his place . You mark my words , Mr. Rex will come to it sooner or later . A pity he had to hang about like this .. . when you think of all those preparations Mr. Baines made for the staff celebration . " " Very unfair to Mr. Baines , " I commented ; and wondered whether I had gone too far ; but Edith was incapable of recognizingirony . It certainly had been inconvenient for Mr. Baines . June 13th . I have heard today  --  through Edith  --  that Sir Henry is taking Miss Derringham on a long sea voyage . It will be very beneficialto the health of them both . " They are going to Australia , " said Edith . " They 've a branch there . So have we , of course . After all , many of our main voyages are to Australia and back . So naturally we 've our branch there . Sir Henry 's not the sort to go for pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disappointment . " " What does her ladyship think of that ? " " She 's furious . Do you know it would n't surprise me if she punishedMr . Rex . " " Send him to bed without his supper ? " 134 THE SECRET WOMAN " Oh , Nurse , you are a one for jokes . But she was talking about solicitors and all that . " " But I thought it was only a postponement and that he just wanted Time . " " Suppose she meets Another out there ? " " But surely there is n't another shipping line like ours ! " " There is certainly not , " said Edith stanchly . " But Sir Henryhas fingers in lots of pies . He 's a man with wide business interests . He might have someone else in mind for Miss Derringham . " " Then what shall we do ? " Edith laughed . " You can bet her ladyship 's got the trump card up her sleeve . " Yes , I thought ; and I wondered what would happen when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . What a stir there is in the house . He is not as important as Rex , of course , but somehow he makes his presence felt . For the last few days Monique has been impossible to control  --  alternating between excitement and depression . " You 'll love the Captain , Nurse , " she told me . " I think that is an exaggeration , " I replied deciding to be the cool nurse . " Nonsense ! All women do . " " Is he so devastatingly attractive ? " " He 's the most attractive man in the world . " " It 's a mercy we do n't all think alike on such matters . " " People think alike about him . " " Wifely prejudice , " I retorted , " and very admirable , of course . " She tried on her dresses , exhausting herself ; then she was depressed . I found her crying quietly one afternoon before he cameTHE CASTLE 135hack . It was not unusual that she should cry but that she should do it quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gasped between sobs . " What nonsense , " I said nonsensically . " You 're his wife . And pray calm yourself . You want to be well for his return . Now come along . What shall you wear for the great occasion ? These beautiful corals . How lovely they are ! " I slipped them round my neck . I loved beautiful things and they became me as much as they did her . " These , " I said , " and that long blue dress . It 's most becoming . " She had stopped crying to watch me . I took it out of the wardrobe and tried it against myself . " There , " I said , " do n't you think that 's lovely . Do n't you see how right for a dutiful wife ? " I composed my features in a humble and devoted expression which made her smile . I was finding that I could often lure her from a stormy mood to a sunny one by one of my little acts . She talked about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well when we married . He had come to the Island . . . only twice . " I pictured the big gleaming ship and the irresistible Captain in his uniform ; the beautiful girl and the tropical island . " He was brought to the house by a friend of my mother 's , " she said . " He dined with us and afterward we walked in the gardens among the fan-shaped palms and the fireflies . " " And he fell in love with you . " " Yes , " she said , " for a time . " Her lips were beginning to tremble so I started to play the amorous captain and the dusky beauty in the garden where the fireflies flitted about the fan-shaped palms . Oh yes , poor Monique was certainly difficult during those days . And when he was in the house it changed , because without meaning to he made his presence felt . And when I saw him I realizedthe attraction . He was certainly good looking  --  taller than Rex , more blond , lacking that reddish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar . The Captain laughed more readily , talked more loudly ; and I should imagine was less guarded than Rex . He was the adventurer type  --  the sea rover ; Rex 's adventures136 THE SECRET WOMANwould be confined to business deals . Rex seemed pale in comparison with the Captain whose skin was deeply tanned ; his deep blue eyes were more startling than Rex 's topaz-colored ones . I could n't help being excited by his arrival . But I did wonder whether his coming had added any happiness to the house . I daresayhis mother was delighted to see him ; and I wondered whether I ought to have a word with him regarding the seriousness of her illness ; but perhaps that was for Dr. Elgin to do . Lady Crediton was cool toward him for obvious reasons and I heard from Edith that this seemed to amuse him rather than upset him . He was that sort of man . I was sorry for poor Monique because it became very clear to me that she was not happy . You 're fickle , Captain , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charms you . And I was thinking a great deal about Anna . I always do ; but particularly now that the Captain was home . But it was long ago that he went to visit her and caused such trouble with old Miss Brett . I could understand the fascination he had had for Anna , though . June zoth . The Captain came to my room this morning , nonchalant , at ease , very much the man of the world . " Nurse Loman , " he said , " I wanted to speak to you . " " Certainly Captain Stretton . Do sit down . " " About your patients , " he went on . Ah yes , he would be concerned about his wife and his mother . " They are both a little better at the moment , " I said . " Perhaps it is due to their pleasure in your return . " " Do you find any change in my wife since you 've been here ? Has her complaint . . . worsened ? " " No . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Monique . I suppose there is nothing more nauseating than to be pursued passionately by someone one does not want . I believed this to be the case with him . And I wondered : Is lie hoping that a benevolent fate will give him his freedom ? " No , " I went on . " Her condition is much the same as when I arrived . ItTHE CASTLE 137depends a great deal on the weather . During the summer she will be a little better , especially if it is not too damp . " " She was better in her own land , " he said . " That 's almost inevitable . " " And ... your other patient ? " " Dr. Elgin will be able to give you more details than I but I think she is very ill . " " These heart attacks . . . ? " " They 're really a symptom of imperfections in the heart . " " And dangerous , " he said . " Which means that at any time she could die . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was a brief silence and then he said , " Before you came here you were on another case . " " I was at the Queen 's House . You probably know the place , " I added craftily . " Yes , I know it , " he admitted . " There was a Miss ... " " Brett . There were two Miss Bretts . My patient was the elder and her niece lived with her . " He was rather easy to read , this Captain . He was not as subtle as Rex . He wanted to ask about Anna ; and I felt a little more friendly toward him . At least he remembered her . " And she died ? " " Yes , she died . Rather suddenly . " He nodded . " It must have been rather alarming for Miss . . er , Miss Brett . " " It was decidedly unpleasant for us both . " " She took an overdose of pills , I heard . " " Yes . That was proved at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had mentioned the matter in the past I had spoken as though I defied anyone to deny it . That was what I did now . " And Miss Brett is still at the Queen 's House ? " I said : " Yes , she is . " He stared beyond me ; and I wondered whether he was thinking of calling on Anna . Surely not . That would cause quite a scandal138 THE SECRET WOMANnow that he had his wife actually living at the Castle . But one thing I did know ; he was not indifferent to her . Young Edward came in , looking for his father , I believed . He had little time for me now ; there was no one for him but his father . His eyes were round with adoration . He had shown me the model of a ship his father had brought him . He took it to bed with him and clutched it all night , Miss Beddoes said ; moreover he had nearly driven her frantic by sailing it in the pond , and had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . He carried the boat under his arm now , and saluted the Captain . " All present and correct ? " asked the Captain . " Aye aye , sir . Gale blowing up , sir . " " Batten down the hatches , " said the Captain with a serious face . " Aye aye , sir . " I watched them . The Captain could charm a child as easily as he could women . He was that sort of a man . June list . Monique spat blood this morning and the sight of it so frightened her that she had one of the worst asthmatical attacks as yet . I believe there had been a scene between her and the Captain on the previous night . He occupied a room close to hers in the turret  --  and because I was not far off and Monique never controlledher voice , I often heard it raised in anger or protest . When Dr. Elgin came he was very grave . He said he thought her conditionwould worsen with winter . The English winter climate would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out before the autumn was over . After he had seen both of the patients he had a long session with Lady Crediton . June 25th . We have had a death in the house . Jane Goodwin awakened me at four o'clock this morning and begged me to go to her mistress ; I scrambled into my slippers and dressing gown but by the time I reached Valerie Stretton she was dead . I was horrified . I had known of course of her precarious condition but when one comes face to face with death and realizes that one willTHE CASTLE 139never see the person again , one feels shaken . I know I should be used to this by now  --  and I am to some extent . But I have never been so shocked by a patient 's death before . I had become so interested in this woman 's story and I was getting to know her . I believed that she had something on her mind and I wanted to discover what , that I might understand her case . There was that occasion when she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out because of the mud on her boots . I felt there was some drama in her life which was still going on , and I wanted to understand it . And now she was dead . June 27th . A house of mourning is a sad place . Lady Crediton finds it most inconvenient , Edith tells me . After all these years her rival is dead . I wonder what she really feels . What passionate emotionserupt within these walls . The Captain is grieved . She was after all his mother . Monique is alarmed . She is afraid of her own death . Edward is bewildered . " Where is my grandmamma ? " he asked me . " Where has she gone ? " I tell him she has gone to heaven . " In a big ship ? " he asked . I said he should ask his Papa , and he nodded as much as to say Papa would surely know . I wonder what the Captain told him . He had a way with children .. . children and women . The west turret is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funeral gloom to penetrate to the rest of the Castle . In Valerie 's old room the blinds are drawn ; the coffin stands on its trestles . I went in to see her for the last time ; she lies there with a white frilled cap hiding her hair and her face looks so young that it seems one of Death 's roles is that of a laundress to iron the lines out . I ca n't help thinking of her coming to the Castle all those years ago , and of her love for Sir Edward and his for her . All that violent passion and now he is dead and she is dead . But their passion lives on for there is the Captain , virile , so vital , so alive to give proof to it . And there is young Edward too , and the childrenhe will have , and their children , and on forever , so that that love affair will have left its mark for generations to come . I feel frustrated that I had not been able to discover what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
