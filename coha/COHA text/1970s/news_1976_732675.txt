txt After a quarter-century of efforts to standardize weapons , the 12 NATO armies in Europe still have 13 kinds of close-range weapons , 6 short-range missiles , 7 medium-range missiles and 5 long-range missiles . At sea , NATO navies employ 36 types of radar , 8 kinds of surface-to-air missiles and 40 varieties of heavy , guns . NATO 's former Supreme Commander , Gen. Andrew Goodpaster , estimated that improvement in standardization could save the NATO nations $12 billion a year and lift effectiveness 30 percent . But arms orders in the billions have proven to be too lucrative a source of profit and too susceptible to national political influences for the adoption of common weapons systems . The six national armies stationed in Germany can not resupply each other 's ammunition and spare parts and often use different grades of fuel . The United States , which has talked the most about collective defense , has often done the least , except when American arms , such as last year 's $2 billion worth of F-16 fighters , have been sold to the allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country should evaluate the campaign just opened by the United States Army , its arms suppliers and their allies on Capitol Hill against the new effort by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and West German Defense Minister Georg Leber to standardize the key components that will dominate logistical support for the main battle tanks the two countries are developing for the 1980 's . Competitive trials of a new American tank against Germany 's projected Leopard II are still scheduled for this fall under a 1974 agreement . But it has become increasingly clear  --  with 10,000 NATO tanks due to be replaced at a cost of $10 billion  --  that neither country was prepared to buy the other 's tank , regardless of which proved superior . On Army urging , Congress already had voted funds for expensive advanced engineering development of the U. S. tank this summer , before the trials . Instead , Mr. Rumsfeld now has postponed the choice between two competing American tanks . He has sent their developers  --  General Motors and Chrysler  --  back to the drawing boards to compete further on a list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be common to the American and German tanks immediately , such as ' tracks , fasteners , wheels and advanced sighting devices . The agreement also calls for the Germans to adopt an American turbine engine and transmission system and for the United States to buy a turret which could accept the German 120 mm. gun , when it is ready , to replace the current American 105 mm . That will mean standardization of ammuntion , fuel and most spare parts , when the engine and guns have been developed . Eventually , little more than the hull and turret designs may remain " national . " Production of a new tank , 13 years in development , is urgent to match Russia 's new model . But whether there now is to be a further delay of four months , as the Pentagon claims , or ten months , as opponents insist , it will be well worth waiting to . achieve this degree of , standardization . The tank is as central to the Army 's strategy as the aircraft carrier is to the Navy 's , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,
