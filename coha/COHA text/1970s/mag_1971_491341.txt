Back in the twenties the man who may yet be hailed as America 's greatest novelist  --  Sinclair Lewis  --  did a series of articles for this magazine about what he called " Adventures in Auto-bumming . " He conducted his research behind the wheel of a T-Ford and only those who can recall traveling the roads in those days know the agonies he must have endured . Only the main roads were hard top . The rest were dusty , pocked with potholes , and given to long stretches of " washboard " which made the Tin Lizzie shimmy like your sister Kate , shook the bolts out of the car and the teeth out of the driver . And the hotels ! The big cities had the only good ones and they were showplaces for the well-to-do with rates to match . But every small town was graced by one of the most miserable , flyspecked , heart-chilling institutions ever to disgrace our landscape  --  the local hostelry . It was usually situated close to the railroad station , to oblige the " drummers " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they plied their trade from town to town . This chummy proximity virtually guaranteed that the exterior of the hotel would be gritty from years of softly descending coal dust , some of which filtered inside to become an integral part of the rugs , the bedding , and frequently the food . The guests ' dreams were punctuated by the huffing and puffing of the locomotives , the crash of cars being switched around , and the bellows of yardmen with leather lungs . Each room was provided with small animal life . The ninning water usually only walked . The dining room struggled to keep one step ahead of ptomaine  --  and often failed . Mattresses were the murderers of sleep . As early as those years , a few farmers here and there put up chicken shacks next to the edge of the back roads , furnished them with army cots and kerosene stoves , and advertised them as havens of private delight  --  the only alternative being to rent the extra room in the farmhouse ( where grandfather died the year before ) and share the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was touring in the twenties . It drove Sinclair Lewis , no mean hand at scathing language , into masterpieces of invective . But in the course of these flights , Lewis had a vision which was fantastic in its foresight : " Somewhere in these states there is a young man who is going to become rich . He may be washing bottles in a dairy lunch . He is going to start achain of small , clean , pleasant hotels , standardized and nationally advertised , along every important motor route in the country . He is not going to waste money on gilt and onyx , but he is going to have agreeable clerks , good coffee , endurable mattresses and good lighting ; and in every hotel he will have at least one suite which is as good as the average room in a modern city hotel . He will invade every town that does n't have a good hotel already ( and at present that means more than 40 percent ) . When he has completed his work he will be in the market for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up . " So spake the prophet Sinclair . As Sinclair Lewis wrote those words in 1920 , the individual he was talking about but was never to meet  --  Kemmons Wilson  --  was a seven-year-old boy in Memphis , Tennessee , hustling pennies after school to help his mother make both ends meet . Today he is the multimillionaire Chairman of the Board , Holiday Inns , Inc . Kemmons Wilson was born in Osceola , Arkansas  --  the kind of grassroots place Sinclair Lewis , a native of Sauk Centre , Minnesota , could well understand . He owes his name Kemmons to the fact that his father was named after the country doctor who delivered him . Sinclair Lewis would have liked to know that . He would have understood , too , what it meant when the boy 's father died nine months later , because the life of Kenunons Wilson is the stuff of which books are made . The widow and only son moved to Memphis , Tennessee , then . And Mrs. Ruby Lloyd " Doll " Wilson turned to supporting the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an auditor 's assistant , and a bookkeeper . Once when Kemmons was fourteen and hotfooting it around Memphis as a drugstore delivery boy , his leg was broken in an automobile accident . His mother took a leave of absence from her job with a meat-processing company . She moved into his hospital room and nursed him night and day for four months . The petite lady became a familiar sight in the hospital . She was only four feet eleven , but her energy was the marvel of the place . But to tell a story like this one , you ca n't just crank the time machine and let it spin out the yarn . Whenever you are talking about a multimillionaire  --  and we certainly are here  --  there are three things to get right to in a hurry . One : just what is he worth ? Two : how did he get that way ? And three : just what is he like as a man ? Kemmons Wilson 's precise worth in dollars is his own business . But the truth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about it any more ( he ca n't even tell you his salary as Chairman of the Board of Holiday Inns , Inc. , and the last time he made a guess , he was some thirty thousand off on the short side ) . He proves this by carrying so little of it around with him that he 's al- ways running out of change , much less bills . He 's a credit-card man . Since we are going to size up Kemmons Wilson , we shall have to face up , as a starter , to the blunt statistics of his industrial empire , and an empire it is . Holiday Inns , Inc. , has assets of more than six hundred million dollars . There are more than 1,350 Holiday Inns open around the world , offering above 195,000 rooms to the public . They are in fourteen countries , as of now , and under construction or planned in thirty-five more . Everyone knows the Holiday Inn just down the pike : the fifty states are more than covered . So are Holland , Belgium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Lesotho . The great sign will shortly go up in Australia , New Zealand , the Samoas , the Fiji Islands , Indonesia , Taiwan , Hong Kong , India , Tahiti , Lebanon , Israel  --  on every continent , in fact , except Antarctica . And do n't be too sure even of that . Even as these figures are published , they are automatically out of date  --  a new Holiday Inn opens about every three days . I caught Kemmons Wilson looking south rather pensively the other day , and he may well have in mind some kind of a mammoth snow palace down at the Pole . It was only in 1952 that Kemmons Wilson took off and started all this  --  his accomplishment on this front alone has been prodigious not only in terms of his success ( which , to tell the truth , he is not overly impressed with ) but in terms of what he has done for the touring public , which is very much on his mind all of the time . Dr. Donald E. Lundberg , Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amherst ( there 's another big school for hotel training up at Cornell ; this thing is getting to be quite a coming thing in careers ) is quite outspoken about Wilson 's contribution : " Wilson did For the motel business what Statler did for the hotel business . He brought comfortable accommodations to the middle class at prices they could afford . He standardized motel keeping much as Howard Johnson standardized the roadside restaurant . All three men  --  Wilson , Statler , and Howard Johnson  --  insisted on cleanliness , relative uniformity and careful attention to maintenance . Such practices endear a product or a service to the middle class who want , above all else , predictability and safety in lodging and food . " The traveler in the automobile wants to know ahead of time what he will find in the way of food , drink , and lodging . He wants to know roughly what it will cost . He wants security and sanitation . He does not expect luxury but is pleasantly surprised when he gets it for a price within his budget . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without undue effort and inconvenience on his part . " It was John D. Rockefeller who brought a standard oil product to the world in the form of the Standard Oil Company , and as a result became the largest seller in the world . Statler , later Howard Johnson , and more recently Wilson , are in the same tradition . They reached the subconscious mind of Americans , satisfying a need for certainty , safety and comfort . In addition , they made their products eminently accessible . " In his early days , Wilson found that not many companies supplying his inns wanted to do the job the Holiday Inn way . So , in 1957 , Inn Keepers Supply Company was set up to supply Holiday Inns ( and anyone else in the in nkeeping trade who cared to shop from this source ) with furniture , draperies , carpeting , lamps , paints , and all that goes into the equipping of a first-rate establishment . The subsidiary has offices in Memphis , Atlanta , and Winston-Salem ; it tests and markets over 150,000 items , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since that time , more than thirty major additional divisions and subsidiaries have been added to the parent company . How Wilson can keep them separated in his head is hard to figure out ( although he obviously is in full command of the entire situation at all times ) since these subsidiaries include meat packing , corrugated containers , data processing , commercial printing , relocatable buildings , furniture manufacture , and outdoor camping facilities . Impressed with the fact that from spring to fall more than one million people camp out each night in this country , Wilson is moving his inn formula outdoors via Trav-L-Park , which will offer the camper clean ceramic tile restrooms , laundry facil-ities , country stores and gift shops , recreational rooms , and outdoor facilities such as swimming pools , shuffleboard courts , miniature golf courses , marinas , and the like  --  a concept which calls for a minimum of one acre per fifteen rental spaces . The recreational vehicle business is booming in Amer-ica these days , and Kemmons Wilson is going to boom along with it , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and Trav-L-Park well on the way . If you 've ever lingered at the usual campsite for travel trailers , you 'll begin cheering Kemmons Wilson right now . Today you can even ride via Holiday Inns . The company owns Tco Industries . Inc. , which controls Continental Trailways , Inc. ? the second largest U.S. inter-city bus system . Tco also controls Delta Steamship Lines , in addition to foreign and domestic tour operations . Holiday Inns , with Gulf Oil Corporation , pioneered in the use of an oil company credit card for charging services . Gulf Service stations are built next door to Holiday Inns whenever practicable . My goodness , Wilson makes his own coffee  --  Coffee Host  --  coffee-making equipment , and candy that you ca n't stop eating . He even bottles his own label of Scotch whiskey , the inside story being that it is one of the very top brands ( 1 know which it is but I wo n't tell ) and sells it for less than the original . Well , lawsamercy . He also owns a passel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has built apartment buildings , office buildings , and warehouses throughout the United States . With Wallace Johnson , his partner and Vice-Chairman of the Board of Holiday Inns , Inc. , he is presently launching a franchise program of " Medicenters , " a type of nursing home . Nobody mentions it in very loud tones around the boss , but Kemmons Wilson also took a flyer in bullfrog and catfish farming once upon a time , and came a cropper . But , heck , ca n't an Arkansas boy have a little fun his own way ? As for fun , he is even starting a chain of nightclubs , each called " Pierre 's , " where the decor is informal , the music mod , and the entertainment young and great . To sum it up , the Sunday Times of London has named that Arkansas boy one of the 1,000 most significant figures of the 20th Century . But listen to this man talk . Down to earth , if anyone ever was . The occasion is May 26 , 1968 . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His son is graduating in this class of ' 68 , and Charles Kemmons Wilson is being awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws , the eminent LL.D . Wilson did not attend any college ; he was too busy trying to help out his mother during those years . He might then be excused for a little braggadocio on such an occasion . But first , he did something which could well have sent a chill through that possibly self-satisfied group of young scholars . He called his address " The Eighty Hour Week . " Some of his points were hammer blows . " You do n't learn to sail on a smooth sea . You do n't learn to ride on a lazy horse . You do n't learn to sell with a popular product .... A man can never be successful until he teaches his wife not to expect him home for dinner .... As long as we 're willing to work , the American dream is not dead . " There 's an old folk tale that says you ca n't kill a frog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and violently to the boiling water that he jumps out before he 's hurt . But if you put the same frog in cold water and heat it gradually , he never decides to jump until it 's too late . By then he 's cooked .... People in a democracy are inclined that way . Take away their freedom overnight and you 'll start a revolution . But take it from them gradually and you can paralyze an entire generation ... maybe an entire nation . " In this country you do n't have to settle for being average ... you can dare to be better ... and I challenge you to do this . Whatever your career choice , make your work count . " I 'm not one to be too much concerned about the youth of today . They 're so much better than I was when I was growing up that they make me ashamed of myself . " If you know Kemmons Wilson you know that he means this . But the way he wound up that speech will also help you to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment made by another character who did n't have the advantage of a so-called formal education . He said : " ' When you ai n't got no education , you jes'got to use yo ' brains . ' " The graduates cheered him for that one  --  Wilson lays it on the line . And the University thought so highly of his address that it was printed up for wider distribution , not s.o.p. on that campus by any means . Kemmons Wilson is a dramatic personality who goes out of his way to avoid dramatizing himself . Part of this is due to his personal makeup ; and part of it is that he is a Southern gentleman , and the lingering cavalier code never did have much truck with big talk . So you have to kind of drag his past out of him and work up slowly to how he started the Holiday Inn system . ( One Southerner I knew used to refer to the " little ole farm " where he was born , the while he rolled his own cigarettes in a somewhat dilapidated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City . I later discovered that the " farm " had originally been one of the most beautiful plantations in the entire South , and that when it was finally sold and staked out into parcels its boundary lines surrounded what is now an entire county . ) After Wilson gave up his work as a delivery boy because of his injured leg , he went into the popcorn business . He was about seventeen at the time . He got the idea Far ahead of his time that popcorn could be sold in movie theaters and went out and purchased a popcorn machine . He must have been quite a salesman even at that time  --  because the terms for the second-hand contraption were nothing down and a dollar a week . Then he went over to the Memphian Theatre and paid them $2.50 to rent the space and pay for the electricity . " Business was real good and after awhile 1 was making about $30 a week , a lot of money in those days . After about six months it got so I was making more money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out and took the popcorn machine over . " Wilson sold him the machine for $50 , which was the precise price of the machine originally , now long since paid for . So Kemmons wound up with his $50 capital back . He took the money and went out and bought five old second-hand pinball machines and started putting them out in drugstores and cafes . It panned out fine . He collected enough money to buy more machines and shortly had quite a business going for himself . At this point he met the girl he was to marry . He had this stand of pinball machines in the Hotel Memphis lobby , and he kind of got talking to a young thing who worked upstairs as assistant bookkeeper in the hotel office . That was Miss Dorothy Lee . They were married when she was about twenty-four and Kemmons twenty-eight . Kemmons saved his pinball machine money and built a house , even though he did n't know anything about building a house . It cost $1,200 and he paid cash for it . With a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for a $3,000 loan on the property . It was a little slow in coming , mostly because the young man had built his house on the wrong lot  --  he had n't bothered with a title survey . However , the man he had bought it from owned the adjacent lot , so after a little chatting , they merely swapped deeds as a couple of Southern gentlemen would . Wilson put the three grand from the loan back into his flourishing pinball business , and about a year later he sold the house for $6,500 . " I said to myself that I had been in the wrong business . I 'm going into the building business . " So he did . He built another house next door to the first one , then some more small houses . After that he built and operated seven motion picture theaters . Then World War II came along . He had once said as a boy that his ambition was not to make a million dollars but to owe a million . Now he had his wish . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing the fear was to liquidate everything before he went into the service : he sold out , paid his debts , came up with a quarter of a million dollars in cash and put that into war bonds . He served as a flight officer in the Air Transport Command from 1943 to 1945 , mostly flying " over the Hump , " which was a way of describing possibly the most hazardous route in the world , up and over the Himalayan range in the north of India , highest mountains in the world , in weather conditions treacherous beyond description . But ... " I was building houses all during the time I was in service . My mother was looking after it , and when was home I would get all of the things lined up , and she would take over and look after it while I was away . When I came back from service , I went into the real estate and building business . I built maybe 5,000 homes and probably that many apartment buildings , too . " In 1951 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loaded our five children into a station wagon and started from our home in Memphis for a vacation trip to Washington , D.C. It did n't take us long to find out that most motels had cramped , uncomfortable rooms  --  and that they charged extra for the children . Few had adequate restaurants and fewer still were air-conditioned . In short , it was a miserable trip . " This is not to say there were no great hotels in that day . There were . But the industry as a whole had reached a lull . During World War 11 , hotels did n't have to worry about empty rooms . Guests paid premium rates for any accommodations at all . They were forced into expensive parking fees and into tips for doormen and bellmen who rendered little more than lip service . " After World War 11 , businessmen began traveling by auto instead of by train , and the family vacation came into its own . In essence , transportation was changing , and the hotel-motel business was ripe for development . " I built the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was then the eastern city limits . It had 120 rooms . We now have thirteen Holiday Inns open in the Memphis metro-politan area , including that first one . It 's still making a profit , and the land has increased twenty-five times in value . " During the next year and a half , I built three more Holiday Inns . Each had a swimming pool , air conditioning , a restaurant on the premises , a telephone in every room , free ice , dog kennels , free parking , and baby-sitters available . " These features are standard in every Holiday Inn today . We have added physicians and dentists on call , the Holiday Inn Magazine , wall-to-wall carpeting , twenty-four-hour phone service , Holidex computerized reservations , and meeting facilities . More than 600 clergymen of all faiths and denominations are chaplains-on-call , available to guests at our Inns . " As the first four Inns in Memphis were completed , I began to see the possibilities of developing a national chain . I needed a man who could think big with me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had built thousands of homes and was hailed by The Saturday Evening Post as ' the Henry Ford of the homebuilding industry . ' " He had started as a carpenter and pioneered low-cost housing , working out a production line for standard parts . When the ' Manhattan Project ' to make the first atomic bomb was still top secret , General George Marshall asked him to develop plans for the city which became Oak Ridge , Tennessee . He had been a leading officer of the National Association of Home Builders , with friends in the business all over the country . It seemed to me that Holiday Inns could be established nationally if prominent home builders all over the nation would build them in their home cities as I had done in Memphis . " One night I drove over to see Wallace and explained my thinking . We talked far into the night . Here was a man who could understand how such an organization could be made to work . That night we shook hands on a partnership which in 1954 became Holiday Inns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc. , it is now parent company for the world 's largest international system of food and lodging facilities . " Wallace and I were idea men and we realized the need for a man with organizational ability . I had been president of the Memphis Home Builders Association that year and Bill Walton , a successful young attorney , had been vice president and general counsel . Bill had made my work with the association so easy that I wanted him to help me and Wallace with organizing Holiday Inns . " In 1955 William B. Walton joined Holiday Inns , having caught the contagious enthusiasm of Wilson and Johnson . Today he is president and day-to-day leader of the Corporation International " Management Team . " " I learned early that you can not do it all yourself , " said Wilson , " and I have had the good fortune to be surrounded by some of the finest executives in the business . " As I said , you have to be careful with Kemmons Wilson  --  he understates by instinct . This is the head of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40,000 or so work for the parent company . Yet when he recently stopped by one of the Inns and quietly asked at the desk if he could see the manager , so retiring is his public image that he was not even recognized . The manager sent out word that he was busy and not to be disturbed . It was only then that Wilson mentioned his name  --  you can imagine how that fellow came out of his private office like a shot from a cannon . I was not there , but I imagine that Kemmons Wilson did everything he could to put the man at his ease . I was there when he asked for one of hisexecutives in the Memphis office who should have been available and was n't . I overheard the boss ask the office staff not to mention the incident in any way : " I do n't want to embarrass him and I do n't want to embarrass myself . " Dorothy Wilson says this is typical of Kemmons . He bears with the first mistake . If it happens again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Kemmons Wilson the man comes on just fine . It is there also that one begins to comprehend the immensity of this Holiday Inn business . All of us tend to take the Holiday Inn scene pretty much for granted . The " roadside " installation is the one you see mostly . But some of these Holiday Inns are little short of palatial . Perhaps you have seen some of the " high rise " Inns such as the octagonal-shaped building in Raleigh , North Carolina , the smashingly modern one in San Francisco , or the thirty-three stories of the Chicago Lakeshore Drive Inn . The Inns in Holiday 's " resort " classification do n't have to bow to any other hotels  --  they are full-fledged resort installations . The one in Miami Beach , smack on Collins Avenue , is among the best . The plants at Aruba , Montego Bay , and Acapulco are stunning , both in location and facilities . The big Inn at Waikiki has 643 rooms on the beach where the big combers roll in , and a view of Diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Holiday Inn in Munich , Germany , and its nightspot , " The Yellow Submarine . " This is a three-story nightclub which guests enter through an underwater tunnel . As they enjoy the discotheque , some thirty live sharks swim restlessly by in tanks surrounding the club , eyeing the nightclubbers balefully through large glass portholes , and to judge from their piscine expressions , reversing the usual process of **33;3078;TOOLONG by keeping an eye on choice morsels cavorting on the dance floor for possible future consumption . Wilson , the former pilot , is especially tickled at the thought that these hammerhead , demon , and sand sharks , captured in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico , were flown to Munich , perhaps the first of their kind to join the jet set . Kemmons Wilson presides over Holiday City in Memphis , Tennessee , as the top kick in a complex which contains in its eighty acres a Holiday Inn , ( and is that shipshape ! ) , the main executive building of the company , shopping facilities , a theater , U.S. Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant , the huge display building of the Inn Keepers Supply Company , and the Institutional Mart of America ( in which about 250 ma nufacturers have displays ) . Everything is brought together and fully assembled , in interiors where construction , design , furnishings and equipment are on handsome display , ready for customers . But the pride and joy of Holiday City is the Holidex reservation system . This is housed in a building that would not be out of place at Cape Canaveral , either in style or in the sophistication of its equipment . Kemmons Wilson is the man to describe for you what it does : " Through our twin IBM 360 computers in Memphis , we can utilize the Holidex network to process reservations and messages from all the Inns , as well as from our six metropolitan area reservation offices and many large corporations with direct lines . " In 1970 we made history in Mexico by becoming the first communications user ever to install its own terminal equipment on a Mexican-leased communications circuit . In that year we also became the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own computerized reservation system with a terminal in Europe . This joined Holiday Inns European headquarters in Brussels , Belgium , to the Holidex system . " We utilize cables to Brussels , but still make transoceanic reservations to Hawaii and Europe using satellites . We have the equivalent of 300,000 miles of leased communication lines now in operation . Today the Holidex computerized reservation system is the world 's largest company-operated communications system . We have handled as many as 172,000 messages in a single day . " Our computers also handle the Holidata bookkeeping system used in the Inns , as well as our corporate reports and financial projections , payrolls , profit sharing , and inventory reports . " Not far away from Holiday City , in Memphis , the system is building Holiday Inn University in Olive Branch , Mississippi . Ground was broken in 1970 for a multimillion-dollar university complex scheduled to open in 1972 on ISO acres of the 3,000-acre Holiday Industrial Park . Each year more than 3,000 employee-students will attend the university , which will be divided into schools of Innkeeping and Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly , only about 300 . It franchises others , but keeps a close watch on how everything is managed ; the University will thus be another tool in keeping the Inn standards up to snuff by indoctrinating innkeepers with the gospel right at the very start . Kemmons Wilson is not a backslapping greeter , but is the kind of man who comes out of his office when you call to say hello to you . At fifty-eight , he is rugged , fit from playing tennis and outworking everybody in sight , stands close to six feet , and is solid all over . He has physical power  --  his hands and wrists are the tipoff to that . He can , and does , dance the night away ( every dance , with every lady in the party , thanks to his own special Arkansas twist of changing partners every minute or so in a midfloor do-si-do ) and you 'd think twice before getting into a fight with him , no matter what football team you played on . he 'd never give up ! He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way which is oddly becoming . He 's restless . " To make money , you 've got to go where money is , " says Wilson , and he goes for it on the average of a hundred thousand miles a year . Says a friend who went along on a ten-day trip by private jet with Kemmons : " He wore me out , and then he wore out two assistants , one at a time . He was up at dawn , never ate breakfast , and I got so worried about our pilots that I started bringing them snacks . " Wilson totes it all up succinctly : " The Good Lord has really blessed me . I never have a sniffle , I never take a pill , I have never been sick  --  just work all the time . " Fortunately , he can catch a nap anywhere and wake up refreshed . Once he did just that on a bridge spanning an interstate highway . He was waiting for a magazine photographer to catch up with him to take a series of shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I usually do most of the talking , " says Kemmons with a very winning grin , " because if I have to listen I may fall asleep . " While I was with him , he walked the legs off a party of us showing us the wonder of Holiday City . At one point we came upon a huge puddle , left over from the morning 's heavy rain . The men waded through , but Kemmons was the first to make a hand-carry for a lady in the party and carry her across the puddle , remarking as he did so that if he had a cloak to throw down in the path before her , he would do that too . One of the most striking things about Wilson is his eyes . I have n't seen eyes like that since I quaked before my last Admiral in World War II . Admirals have weathered faces from the days at sea , and their eyes burn out a bit from squinting over sunlit horizons , and if the eyes are blue to begin with they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are this startling kind of blue , and I could swear that the color can alter from the veriest blue of a baby 's stare to a flinty gray which could scare the daylights out of a hostile lumberjack . Everything fascinates him . Walking through the printing plant ( they print eleven million copies of their guidebook alone every year , with millions of other items such as menus , magazines , house organs , and even outside contract work ) he knows the ins and outs of all of the equipment , and talks to the operators as man to man . He is wearing a necktie with a Holiday Inn motif , and discusses that with one of his purchasing staff like a fashion expert . His people obviously enjoy this kind of cross chat with him . Kemmons Wilson has an ear for details . A classic complaint turned up recently : seems a traveling salesman wrote in some slighting remarks about the minuscule size of the Holiday Inn soap bars . Wilson took this as a personal challenge . " We made a study to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-ounce bar to one-and-a-half ounces . When we learned it would cost an additional $1,200 a day , I wrote the guy and had to admit we could n't do anything about his complaint . " It looked like a lost round . But the salesman was so enchanted to have the big boss from Memphis rapping with him over the soap situation that he wrote back saying that he would evermore stay at Holiday Inns but would bring his own cake of soap . Wilson has another angle on l'affaire bubble bath . " We know that most hotel guests really do n't want a large cake of soap , they want a fresh small one for every shower or bath . Our real problem is what to do with all of the leftover pieces . We found the answer  --  we grind them all up into soap flakes and use them in a washing compound . " The Wilson zest is contagious . He 's lived in the same house for the past twenty-one years , and although it is handsome and spacious and hardly lacks for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of his means . " I learned a long time ago that money is probably the most unimportant thing in the world , providing you have enough to live the way you want to . I know some people who spend a million dollars a year , and they require that much . An ordinary guy like me could n't spend that much . " Well ... OK , if he says so . But this " ordinary guy " was in Monaco not long ago , chatting at home with Princess Grace and Prince Rainier , and when in Iran , he visited the Shah . Home is where the heart is , at least with Wilson . His wife Dorothy , ? today , dark-eyed , charming , soft spoken and fetching as ever in that specially feminine way so many Southern girls have  --  is obviously the apple of his eye , and the companion to everything he does , whether mixing drinks with a tremendous gusto or going over the details of the next big merger . That all started long ago . In 1941 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little plane he had bought for peanuts : then they 'd barnstorm the Continued on page 123 // t owns around Memphis .. ? she 'd sell dollar tickets to all corners , and he would fly them over their own homes . " That 's how we paid for the plane and the gas , " she reveals now . She is his favorite partner all along the line , including dancing , which she enjoys with verve and style . The lady is a poised hostess , a community leader without peer who leads rather than directs , a mother adored by her family , and is . . . well , a lady , if you take it in the full and rare sense of the word . Wilson is lucky , and he knows it . The Wilson office is a big one , neither the kind which is an image builder for his ego , nor small enough to damage it . On the wall behind his semicircular desk is a large photograph of his mother , surrounded by fourteen framed portraits of his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citations of every kind , and photographs which begin with Norman Vincent Peale and wind up with one showing Kemmons Wilson during a private audience with His Holiness the Pope in Rome , an event the Memphis Methodist recalls very proudly . His office has " that lived-in " look , with a clutter of merchandise all over the place , such as books , candy , magazines , newspaper clippings . The furniture is handsome but obviously built for comfort . When you write about a man , any man , there 's always one secret thing about him you have to know-because if you do n't know that one thing , you can write 75,000 words and still fail to catch what makes him tick . Sometimes you do n't find it out at all ; and then you might as well tear up everything you 've written because it just does n't mean a thing . Yes , Kern mons Wilson is a complex personality . He is powerful , and tender ; proud , but oddly modest . He would give you anything-but do n't for God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hard as molybdenum , but a pushover for anyone in his family . He was born poor ; now he is rich . But all that avails you nothing unless you know why . I found out , fortunately , before 1 had been with him too long in Memphis . We were touring his printing plant and stopped by one of the offices where they run a special little operation-looking into every possible kind of merchandise manufactured anywhere in the world which might fit into the Holiday Inn line . Everybody refers to the place as Grandma 's attic , and indeed a body would have to have one foot in the grave if this collection of knickknacks , gimcracks and whatzies did n't tickle his fancy . Of course , like everything else Wilson does , this operation winds up making a mint . But he also enjoys it like everything else that he does . Well , the man in charge of the shop talks a bit and then comes up with a shallow square box . " It 's mighty hard to find something for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , " but maybe you 'll like this . " Wilson takes it and very simply says , " Thank you . " Then he opens the box and lifts out a china plate . On it is a beautifully reproduced photograph of his mother . " Thank you , " Wilson says again . He looks at it for just a trifle more than a few seconds . That is longer than you think . In his eyes , I see the moment fall away , I see a child orphaned at nine months in Osceola , Arkansas . I see a boy with a broken leg lying in a Memphis hospital . And now I know that there on that plate is what makes this multimillionaire tick . He 's still Doll 's boy , and while there 's strength in him , there is n't anything in the world he would n't try to do-just to make her proud of him .
