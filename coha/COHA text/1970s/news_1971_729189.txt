txt The Defense Department acknowledged today that 15 to 20 Americans in civilian clothes landed at Pnompenh airport last night to retrieve two damaged helicopters and take them back to South Vietnam for repairs . The men were disclosed to have been carrying sidearms . A Pentagon spokesman , responding to questions about a Columbia Broadcasting System report on the episode , acknowledged that the rescue team had landed at Pnompenh in three United States Army , helicopters . He identified the men only as " U. S. personnel , " declining to say specifically that they were military men . Pentagon officials also declined to confirm that these men carried weapons or to explain why they were in civilian clothes . The United States command in Saigon said that the men had worn civilian clothes under their flying suits " in conformance with established policy of the U. S. Embassy in Pnompenh " and that they had carried sidearms as " air crews normally do " in combat areas , The Associated Press reported . In a report by Its correspon ? dent in Pnompenh , Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having said the mission was C.B.S . Cyr:Blau News %vitt , Waller Cronkile led ' by a Colonel and that the men could be seen changing into uniforms or flight suits once they went back into their own aircraft . ' he pictures showed the men nth sidearm . Defense Department officials idicated that the two recovced helicopters were among ; ix Cambodian helicopters damaged last Friday in an enemy raid on the airport , The network reported the dis . tied aircraft had no nationality markings , but had tail numbers like those used by the United States Army . C. B. S. said there were eight such " anonymous aircraft " at the Pnompenh airport , in addition to the six damaged Cambodian helicopters . From time to time there have been reports of unmarked American-made helicopters flying spotter missions in Cambodia . Parts of Mr. Webster 's report from Pnompenh were carried on C.B.S . radio during the day and the complete report , with film , was carried on the " C.B.S . Evening News With Walter Cronkite . " Mr. Webster said that although ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " through a fluke " he paid a visit there . He said the Americans were led " by a full colonel , Colonel , one G.I. said his name was . " He said the colonel " was very upset by our presence and would n't come within a hundred feet of us , much less answer questions . " Concerning the helicopters the men recovered , Mr. Webster said : " They are the standard UH-1 models but do not say U. S. Army , do not have South Vietnamese insignias and presumably are not Cambodian . " The six helicopters the U. S. gave Cambodia can be found elsewhere among the debris . So , who owns these ? The only hint is a five digit number on the tail in black paint . That 's the way the U. S. Army numbers its choppers , but here all other insignia have been obliterated . Judging by the adjacent wreckage there were about eight unmarked helicopters here . The others are just a pile of rubble now . These two escaped being blown up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men as members of the 520th Transportation Battalion of the United States Army , stationed in South Vietnam , The Defense Department , in a three-sentence statement , did not identify whose helicopters had been rescued . It said that initial reports from the American command in Saigon indicated the rescue team was " on the ground about one hour while the men rigged the damaged helicopters for recovery.e Defense officials said the American team flew into Pnompenh in three helicopters . Two were huge , banana shaped Chinook ** capable of lifting the smaller disabled craft back to Vietnam . Both the Defense Department and State Department were at pains once again today to eraIphasize that the Administration was abiding by Congressional prohibitions , against the introduction of American ground troops or advisers into Cambodia . State Department officials , reportedly concerned about Congressional sensitivity to increased American involvement , were understood to have blocked attempts by the Defense Department to station 50 members of a military equipment delivery team at the American Embassy in Pnompenh . Civilian officials said that the State Department had insisted that  --  the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Pentagon eventually , accepted that limit . Considerably more military personnel , State Department officials said , will be sent into Pnompenh on temporary duty to assist with the delivery of American military equipment to the Cambodian forces and to provide an accounting for Congress that the equipment is properly delivered . On the average , officials said , 20 or more Americans from the military command in Saigon are in Cambodia on temporary assignment on any given day . The recovery of the Cambodian helicopters for repairs in South Vietnam was cited by American officials as an example of their duties . The State Department spokesman today took a more conservative view than the Defense Department on whether it was permissible for the United States to provide instructors for the Cambodian Army in the use of American equipment . Yesterday , Jerry W. Freidheim , the pentagon spokesman , said that instructors were permissible though the Administration had no plans to send them to Cambodia . Today Robert J. McCloskey , the State Department spokesman , declined under questioning to confirm that interpretation of Congressional restrictions . State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the lead in justifying that stand to Congress .
