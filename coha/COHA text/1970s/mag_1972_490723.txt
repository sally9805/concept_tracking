THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment 11-AST week , the President once again summoned the nation around its television sets to re-ceive a surprise message . Once again , he had secrets to share with us infor-mation about secret trips , secret meetings , secret proposals . We 've also learned secrets of a different kind recently , by courtesy of Jack Anderson and Daniel Ellsberg , among others . Their secrets tended to show that the President ( whoever the President was ) had been wrong and his opponents right . But President Nixon 's secrets showed that he was right and his opponents were wrong . " Nothing is served by silence when it misleads some Americans into accusing their own government of failing to do what it has already done , " he said , and he also said , " We are being asked publicly to set a terminal date for our withdrawal when we already offered one in private . " His point immediately won almost universal acceptance . Senator Muskie , while expressing some misgivings , said , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a date certain , to withdraw all of our forces in Vietnam . " Senator McGovern noted that " at the same time Mr. Nixon was bitterly opposed to the McGovern-Hatfield proposal to end the war , he was ... offering it to the other side . " And the next day most columnists seemed to agree with James Reston 's remark in the Times that the President 's disclosure " clearly puts Edmund S. Muskie , Hubert H. Humphrey , George S. McGovern , and John V. Lindsay in the position of attacking the President for refusing to offer what the President now discloses he has offered long ago . " Nearly everyone agreed that the President had now done what his opponents had been asking him to do . But it is n't true . His opponents ' principal proposals for ending the war were very different from the President 's plan . It is a matter of the plainest public record . Thousands of words have been written about these proposals , and they have been embodied in hills before Congress . The McGovern-Hatfield amendment , to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a date for a withdrawal of American forces and an exchange of prisoners six months after the enactment of the legislation . The President 's plan calls for a withdrawal of American troops and a prisoner exchange six months after a political settlement with the North Vietnamese . In other words , the McGovern-Hatfield amendment called for a withdrawal with or without a political settlement , whereas the Nixon plan requires a political settlement first , and the settlement he offers is one that all observers  --  incIud ing , no doubt , the President himself  --  know is unacceptable to the North Vietnamese . These are not superficial or merely technical differences . They arc the kind of deep , fundamental differences that have been tearing the country apart over the last decade . The case of Senator McGovern , whose record on the war has been consistent and straightforward , and who does n't usually make this kind of slip , is particularly instructive . He wanted to point out that if you believe what the President is now saying , you have to conclude that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others for putting forward the McGovern-Hatfield amendment ; that hr was attacking them , and questioning their patriotism , for merely proposing what he was actually doing ; and that now , having himself been a party to the secret of the new plan , he was turning around and accusing them of being dupes of the enemy- - of having let themselves be " falsely used by the enemy to stir up divisiveness in this country , " as he put it in his speech . But in pointing out this inconsistency McGovern neglected to look at the root of the matter  --  whether the President 's secret proposal really was the same as the McGovern-Hatfield amendment  --  and thus he seemed , for a moment , to join the rest of the world in forgetting his own fine record on the war . No doubt he and others will soon recover and set the record straight again . But McGovern 's aberration , together with almost everyone else 's , provided a remarkable display of the extent to which American politics has come to he ruled by propaganda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader who tries to rewrite history must dream of he had wiped out his opposition 's memory of its own actions . In a way , his television blitz was as impressive a display of Presidential power as the heaviest B-52 raid . It revealed , at the start of this election year , the stunning range of his political resources : his power to commandeer television ; his power to dominate the news with pseudo-events , or with real events undertaken For domestic political purposes ; his power to undercut the opposition by first withholding and then revealing state secrets ; and his power to obliterate the public record with the sheer prestige of his office . ? DURING the closing weeks of - 1 - -   ? 197/ , when the Nixon Administration 's support of President Yally a Khan of Pakistan brought relations between the United States and India to a sorry pass , something was happening that , in a modest way , may ultimately help to repair the harm . On December 20th  --  the same day that a Times survey reported that the " moral influence " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? an unusual record album went on sale . Its cover shows a photograph of a Bengali refugee child under the title " The Concert for Bangladesh . " It is a recording , on three discs , of a benefit concert held in Madison Square Garden last August 1st . That concert was organized by George Harrison , a former member of the Beatles , and his friend and teacher the Bengali sitarist Ravi Shankar . Bob Dylan was among the performers who donated their services . The concert raised a quarter of a million dollars for a fund , administered by UNICEF , for the relief of the Bengali refugees . The price of the record album is twelve dollars and ninety-eight cents , of which five dollars goes to the t'NICEF fund . Sales of the record have already added about four and a half million dollars to the fund , and that sum will almost certainly he quadrupled by the end of 1972 . A 70-millimetre color film of the concert is now in preparation and may raise as much as thirty million dollars more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and a multitude of their fans ) will turn out to have contributed to the relief of the refugees in an amount normally at the disposal only of the richest governments . This is ex-traordinary . Nothing quite like it has ever happened before . Even so , it may seem strange to suggest that a rock record album could have anything at all to do with matters of high policy . But a large proportion of younger Americans , including many of the most sensibk and politically concerned , count rock music as an important part of their lives . George Harrison is someone they trust and admire  --  more , it hardly seems necessary to say , than they trust and admire President Nixon or Henry Kissinger . To these young men and women , the fact that George Harrison , Bob Dylan , Ringo Starr , Eric Clapton , and others pooled their efforts so impressively on behalf of a particular cause was a signal that that cause deserved to be taken seriously . Mr. Harrison is not a political figure in any conventional sense , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view . His response to the events in South Asia was , broadly speaking , humanitarian ; and because his starting point was a knowledge of and a respect for the music and culture of Bengal and India his hu-manitarianism was based on something inure substantial than generalized pity . By con-trast , Mr. Kissinger , acting as Mr. Nixon 's surrogate in the councils of state , seemed to be living in an entire ' ) different world : a world of maps with pins in them , of spheres of influence , of geopolitical ma-neuverings ; a world that , for all its hardheaded " realism , " had little to do with the less abstract realities of human suf-fering in East Bengal . The money that Mr. Harrison and his associates and his fans are raising will relieve the pain of many Bengalis . And  --  what is perhaps more significant for the future of Indian-Ameri-can relations  --  because of the concert , the record , and the film , a vast number of young Americans will henceforth have a special feeling for the people of Bangladesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that the " youth vote " will turn Mr. Nixon out of office becausa he kept silent when the Pakistan Army tried to destroy the people of East Bengal and because he " tilted " toward the wrong side when war came , But governments can get away with such policy decisions only when no one is listening . And if enough people listen to " The Concert for Bangladesh , " the Administration will find itself obliged to listen to them . ? VIRST , our President was phoning in plays to football coaches . Now he is writing to horses . No , that 's not fair . Our President is not yet writing to horses ; he is writing about horses . The horse in question , called Black Jack , is the horse that walked behind the coffin at President Kennedy 's funeral . Black Jack apparently had a birthday the other day . A Virginia lady baked him a cake , which was nice of her . President Nixon wrote a letter to her . " I knew that all Americans would want to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served our nation and our people so well , " the President wrote . So much for horses . A less romantic , although equally docile , creature in our midst , which also appears to be trying to serve our nation and our people well , is something called Public Broadcasting . Here is a statement to the press by the head of the White House Office of Telecommunications , Clay T. Whitehead : There is a real question as to whether public television , particularly the national federally funded part of public television , should be carrying public affairs , news commentary , and that kind of thing , for several reasons . One is the fart that the commercial networks , by and large , do quite a good job in that area . Public television is designed to be an alternative , to provide programming that is n't available on commercial television ; so you could raise the legitimate question as to should there be as much public affairs , as much news and news commentary , as they apparently plan to do .... What this arrogant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been Ear from perfect , that has been constantly struggling for money and personnel , but that is the best alternative available to the inadequacies and Administration-directed deferences of commercial television -- is to he dismissed , at the time we need it most ( in an election year ) , by a wave of a White House hand . For most of its history in this country , Public Broadcasting has had a hard time of it . Its administrators have often been inept . Its trustees and directors have often been the same hank presidents and lawyers and educators who make true growth , and change , and new departures so difficult to achieve in other areas of this country 's life . The public-television stations have seemed to be spending most of their time scrambling for money  --  money that has rarely been sufficient to do more than buy up old B.B.C. programs or chow lessons in flower arranging . Recently , however , there has been a small surge in money from the foundations , and even a small surge in interest from the public  --  some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that a nation that learns its daily history and acquires its daily sense of reality from network news departments is not doing itself any great favor . There is a Corporation for Public Broadcasting . It has spent money ( some think too much money ) to hire experienced newsmen . Many of the public-television stations are overhauling and expanding their news programs . Still , there is a pressing need for longterm funding from the government which is , after all , the basis on which the whole thing was set up . And it is this long-term funding that the Nixon people have been playing around with . John Macy , Jr. , the head of the Corporation , recently remarked , " The current situation is one of the Corporation awaiting word from the Administration as to what its position actually is . There are exchanges of material and occasional conversations , but nothing definite has come from the Administration . " It seems to us high time there was something definite some money . A few weeks ago , a Republican congressman spoke out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leftist . Now we have Mr. Whitehead , who says that we do n't really need Public Broadcasting 's news , because we have such a wonderful supply of it from the networks , and because any more of it , presumably , would turn our heads , or , at any rate , cause confusion , ill feeling , and anal tie si  --  cle among the citizenry . Mr. Whitehead is profound ! ) wrong . Books , Ideas , and Talk JOHN WILLIAM WARD , the new president of Amherst College , is an animated , handsome , dark-haired , keen-el ed , unpretentious man of forty-nine , a squash and tennis player , a wide-ranging reader , and a thoughtful essayist in the fields of literature- , education , history , and social manners . He was horn in Boston , the son of a doctor ; his two sisters are doctors ; he was going to he a doctor but changed his mind during the Second World War , in which , having left Harvard ( following Boston Public Latin School ) during his sophomore year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normandy and South of France landings . We learned all this the other afternoon , when he was in town for a reception in Isis honor . We asked for a mufti reminiscence , and he said , " I grew up in the suburbs of Dorchester and Brighton , in that special odor of corruption that flows over Boston . IVhen I left Harvard , in the fall of 1942 , I was a biochemistry major , but when I returned , in 1946 , I took up American history and literature . F. O. Matthiessen and Perry Miller , on the faculty , influenced me toward books , ideas , and talk . " Next , in 1948 , was the University of Minnesota , " where my fiancee , a Boston girl , followed me , married me , and , along with the deferred G.I. Bill of Rights , helped put me through graduate school by working as a secretary , " he said . " While I was at Harvard , I worked summers in the shipyards at Quincy  --  you could make twelve or fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of money . I went to Minnesota because Henry Nash Smith was teaching there  --  a really great teacher . He came to my inaugural at Amherst and made a speech . " Mr. Ward has been a teacher most of his life . After Minnesota , he taught first English and then history ? " I call it cultural history " at Princeton un-til 1964 , when he went to Amherst . " I knew a lot of people at Amherst , " he said . " There was a tremendous pool of talent there in American history . I thought I 'd have a quieter life there , and more time for writing . This was n't true . I 'd thought I was an excellent teacher at Princeton . At Amherst , I found l was n't a very good teacher . I was not paying enough attention to the development of the young , to the shift that the whole university u.orld has been going through in the last ten years  --  away from expertise to being a good person . I became more involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary tradition and in violence in America . I legally took over as presi dent last July , but I really began in September . We 're not big , we 're not anonymous , and we 're not a university ; we 've never had any problems of confrontation or occupation of buildings . We have a hundred and one blacks among twelve hundred and fifty students ; we want more . Amherst is a very privileged place , relatively , but the serious problem that such privileged institutions are facing is the loss in the range of students from the middle-income group . It costs five thousand dollars a year to maintain a student . Sixty-three per cent of our students come from families with incomes of over twenty thousand dollars a year ; about forty per cent come from families with over thirty thousand dollars a year . There 's a danger of a privileged group 's predominating . We want to reach further into the **28;4121;TOOLONG group . We have twenty-eight per cent of our students on scholarship aid , and we hope to push this up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three sons : David , nineteen ; Christopher , seventeen ; and Andrew , nine . " I discussed my new job with them , " he said . " David is at the University of Rochester , so he was n't much involved . Christopher was against it . ' You wo n't be as honest , ' he said . change your character . You wo n't be as open . ' Andrew , the little one , was concerned that I 'd spend less time with him . Well , we take him on trips , and I 'm home most evenings . My wife and are going to Paris this spring , for our first vacation , hut , as a rule , if I 'm away from my desk for more than ten days I get restless . " At our suggestion , Mr. Ward sent us a sampling of his essays , a few of which have been collected in a book called " Red , White , &; Blue : Men , Books , and Ideas in American Culture . " Herewith a sampling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Flight " : Lindbergh was so innocent of his future that on his flight he carried letters of introduction . . The flight was not the heroic lone success of a single daring individual but the climax of the cooperative effort of an elaborately interlocked technology .... The worship of the machine which was en , - 5regrijarri bodied in the public 's response to Lindbergh exalted those very aspects which were denigrated in the celebration of the flight as the work of a heroic individual .... In Lindbergh , the people celebrated both the sell-sufficient individual and the machine . Americans still celebrate both . We cherish the individualism of the American creed at the same time that we worship the machine which increasingly enforces collectivized behavior . Whether we can have both , the freedom of the individual and the power of an organized society , is a question that still haunts our minds . From " The Intellectual : Cleric or Critic The intellectual becomes not only the conveyor of traditional values but critic of the very values he wishes to convey . So we , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsettling posture of being inside and outside our society , passionately committed to it , yet by that very passion inevitably somewhat alienated from it .... Little wonder that the society that supports us should be uneasy about what we are up to and little wonder we can not easily say whether the main function of the University is the preservation of the old or the discovery of the new . From " The University : The Tremble with Higher Education " : As Americans move into the end of the twentieth century , there is one institution which can no longer afford the luxury of waiting to see how the story turns out , and that is the institution of education itself .... If higher education accepts the role of acting as witness against society , as well as servant to it , the burden of fostering minds which are free as well as servants , minds which may control power and not simply be victims to it , then we have the university and the ideal of a liberal education . What troubles American higher education today is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternatives . It must meet both demands . It must serve power and yet make that pow er humane . Whether it can or not is at the bottom of what troubles American education today . Dance Gala LST week , we attended a lighthearted fund-raising gala  --  for the New York Public Library 's Dance Collection . We can report that it was both a cultural landmark  --  the first cooperative effort by five major dance companies operating in the New York area  --  and a rousing financial success . ( The evening raised $106,032.90 , or enough to keep the Collection open to the public for more than a year . ) The audience was a knowledgeable mixture of prominent people and diehard dance huffs , and the performances , all of which were donated , ranged from solos ( Lawrence Rhodes , Natalia Makarova , fudith Jamison ) through pas de deux ( Margot Fontcyn and Attilio Lahis , Gelsey Kirkland and Helgi Tomasson , Melissa Hayden and Peter Martins ) to three remarkable group efforts : Jerome Robbins ' very funny " The Mistake Waltz , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Anton Dolin 's romantic " Pas de Quatre . " A few days before the gala , we accepted an invitation to visit the Dance Collection , which is in the Lincoln Center library . After a tour of the premises , we discovered that it contains the largest assemblage of dance-related materials ever to have been gathered under one roof . Our guide was Genevieve Oswald , a vivacious , dark-haired , dark-eyed North Carolinian , who is both curator of the Collection and unofficial den mother for the New York dance establishment . " When I was asked to build a dance library , in 1948 , we had seven hundred books and eight hundred programs , " Miss Oswald told us . " Now we have twenty-eight thousand books and seventy thousand programs , but they represent only ten per cent of our total holdings . Dance is a visual and an ephemeral art , and the problem we faced was how to capture it in the form of a permanent record . So we expanded our collection to include films , videotapes , photographs , drawings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of memorabilia . " We asked Miss OsTHE NEW YORKER 29 wald to show us some of the rare items in the Collection , and she led us through banks of bookcases to a gray steel cabinet . Unlocking a door , she produced a set of black portfolios ( " The most complete set of original Nijinsky photographs in existence " ) , some boxes of manuscripts ( " Isadnra Duncan 's letters to Gordon Craig " ) , and a small vellum-hound volume , which , she informed us , had been donated by the late Walter Toscanini . " This is one of the earliest dance documents known to exist , " she said , turning the pages to show us delicate Renaissance script . " It was written , in about 1460 , by an Italian dancing master who called himself Giorgio e del Giuden , and it contains descriptions of several dances that were choreographed by Lorenzo de Medici . " Our final stops were the print-conservation laboratory --  -- a room where graphics are put on mats and restored  --  and the film archive and print stacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph files , and shallow cases holding thousands of prints and drawings . Miss Oswald pulled out a famous lithograph of the four ballerinas who had danced the original " Pas de Quatre , " in 1845 , and explained that it showed the final tableau of the ballet . " From other sources  --  letters , notebooks , diaries , newspaper accounts of the period  --  we can put together additional clues about the style and the steps , which we can pass on to a modern choreographer , " she went nn . " Today , of course , film is the all-important record . In 1967 , Jerome Robbins assigned part of his ' Fiddler on the Roof ' royalties to the Collection , and we have used some of this money to film fifty-eight major dance works and preserve them for future generations . " On the afternoon of the Gala , we dropped by the City Center to watch the dancers rehearse for the first  --  and only  --  time with their orchestra , which consisted of volunteers . As we made our way through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tights , and Natalia Makarova , in a white net tutu , warming up in opposite corners with slow leg extensions and plii.s . An elegant white-haired man , who turned out to be the choreographer and former dancer Anton Dolin , embraced a striking brunette , whom we identified as Maria Tallchief , the recently retired prima ballerina of the New York City ballet . " I flew in from Lisbon last week to restage Pas de Quatre , ' " said Mr. " I flew in from Chicago this morning , " said Miss Tallchief . " Everybody 's coming tonight , " Mr. Dolin said . Two stagehands stepped up to shake hands with Miss Tallchief , and she asked them how the rehearsal was going . " Fine , except for the ' Dying Swan , ' " said one of the men . " Miss Makarova wants the stage so dark that you need radar to pick her up . " Onstage , Donald Saddler , the producer of the Gala , was chatting with Agnes de Milk , Lucia Chase , and Maria Karnilova , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their roles in Antony Tudor 's " Judgment of Paris " ? a ballet whose plot involves three ladies of pleasure in a Paris bistro who put on their acts to impress a rich customer . " When you 've done this ballet as often as we have , you remember the steps automatically , " said Miss Chase , a tiny , green-eyed hrone tte , who was wearing a wine velvet corselet and carrying a bedraggled pink feather boa . " Marusha , your variation comes first . " Miss Karnilova romped through an abandoned tango , fluttering her fan during a dozen coy poses . Miss dc Mille , who was virtually unrecognizable in black-rimmed glasses , a long blond wig , and a 1hl ? , z. satin costume trimmed with an enormous orange how , tried a few and struck a pose holding two hoops behind her hack . " M ) husband 's coming , in a state of near unconsciousness , to see if I 'm going to make a fool of myself , ? she told Mr. Saddler . " You 'll bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Milk bent toward him and leered benevolently , twirling one of her hoops on the end of a finger . " I commissioned this ballet in London in 1938 , and I 've always been fond of it  --  it 's so tacky and so tragic , " she said . " As a matter of fact , my number is rather difficult , because of these blood ) hoops . And every single pose do is thoroughly bad dancing . " " Antony 's choreography is a miracle of asymmetry , " said Miss Chase , rearranging her boa and releasing a snowstorm of feathers . " We found the original Ballet Theatre costumes , and I 'm probably going to shed bits of my boa all over the stage . " The orchestra struck up a tune from " The Threepenny Opera , " and the three ladies formed a chorus line and made their entrance with a slow shuffle and a series of bent-knee kicks that broke up the backstage crew and convulsed several young dancers who were watching from the wings . " Please keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said an assistant stage manager severely . " Oh , let ' em laugh , for God 's sake , " said Miss de Mille , aiming an expert kick through one of her hoops . " Dance is getting so pious and abstract these days . This kind of theatre is supposed to be fun . "
