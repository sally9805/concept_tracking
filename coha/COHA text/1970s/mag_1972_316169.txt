Week after week , the networks delayed their annual ritual of announcing the new fall schedules . Was some major policy shift in the offing ? Were the congressional hearings on TV violence being taken to heart ? Apparently not . When the final schedules were revealed last week , the delays seemed merely a result of the usual intramural poker game . All three networks are holding new hands , but the viewer is getting the same old deal . <P> Some longtime favorites are being dropped in the program shuffle . CBS 's twelve-year-old My Three Sons and four-year-old Glen Campbell Show are going , and ABC is twitching its nose and making the eight-year-old Bewitched disappear from prime time . Some newer favorites are spawning the inevitable offspring . CBS is cashing in on All in the Family 's success by giving Mrs. Bunker 's Cousin Maude her own show . The ethnic emphasis begun by Family is showing up in several new entries . The Catholics and Jews are getting CBS 's Bridget Loves Bernie , a variation on Abie 's Irish Rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a more tentative gesture , ABC has Kung Fu , an adventure show set in the old West with a Chinese hero , to be aired every fourth Saturday . <P> Reverse Alchemy . Violence is holding its own . Five crime and Western shows are being canceled by the networks , but another six are being added . TV 's medical corps , on the other hand , is definitely growing . NBC plans The Little People , about a Hawaiian pediatrician and his pediatrician daughter , and ABC has Temperature 's Rising , about the chief surgeon in a big city hospital . Both shows will combine the medical genre with the situation-comedy formula . The only new programming of a serious nature is an hour on NBC that will alternate between NBC Reports and Alistair Cooke 's BBC-Time-Life Films series , America . <P> The networks are also persisting in the reverse alchemy that so often has turned movie gold into weekly dross . An hour-and-a-half round robin of mystery shows on NBC will include Richard Widmark in a series called Madigan , adapted from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MASH , the grisly 1970 comedy about a troupe of Army surgeons in Korea , is becoming a half-hour situation comedy starring Alan Alda . <P> Also on CBS , Anna and the King of Siam , which has seen every other incarnation , will turn up as a series called Anna and the King . The schoolteacher will be played by Samantha Eggar ; the King by the actor who took the role in Broadway and film musicals and seems to hold a patent on it : Yul Brynner.
