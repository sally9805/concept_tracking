Publishers plan awards <P> The Oscar . The Emmy . The Tony . The Grammy . Next , the Bookie ? Now that the Association of American Publishers has replaced the 30-year-old National Book Awards with something called the American Book Awards , that is a distinct possibility . The association grandly suggests that " a plaque or statuette designed by a major American artist " be awarded to winners . Unfortunately , there is no promise as yet of a checkette drawn on a major American bank . <P> Although nearly all of the men and women on the American Book Awards committee are New York-based executives , their program sounds like something concocted at the Polo Lounge of the Beverly Hills Hotel . In a nine-page memo informing its members of the new awards , the A.A.P. proposal committee said that once winners have been chosen , " they will be announced at an awards ceremony that is envisioned as a gala evening of entertainment , a celebration for the industry , and a news event for the media . " Following their flashier big brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established an " academy . " Organizations suggested for membership include not only hardback and paperback publishers but associations representing bookstore owners , jobbers , publicists , advertisers , librarians and , finally , authors and critics . <P> Nominating and balloting procedures appear to have more in common with political conventions than with literary panels . Independent committees from various parts of the business will select book candidates . The academy will distribute about 2,000 voting rights throughout the A.A.P. membership . In general , the bigger the company , the more votes it will be able to cast . Categories are no longer confined to such elite fare as poetry and belles lettres . New subjects include such mass-market items as religion and inspiration , selfhelp , cooking , crafts , gothic romances , historical novels , fantasy , science fiction , mysteries and westerns . <P> Publishers , many of whom have been taken over by entertainment conglomerates , should be pleased by these new arrangements . For years , officials in the book business complained that the National Book Awards refused to acknowledge the growth of popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges angered sponsoring publishers by rejecting Erich Segal 's Love Story as too lightweight for consideration . <P> The American Book Awards can not ignore serious writing . But as in a children 's summer camp , there will be a prize for nearly everyone . In addition to the standard awards for the best novel and verse , there will be recognition for jacket designs and paperback covers . To reduce further the chance of disappointment , the academy assures its sponsors that a book that does not win in hardback will be eligible to compete in paperback categories the following year . <P> Estimated budget for this extravaganza of self-hype is $460,000 , which includes start-up costs , staff , publicity , hall rent and partying . There is no specific allocation for authors who would rather take the money and write . The first Bookies are scheduled to be presented in the spring of 1980 , when an appropriately distinguished M.C. suspensefully requests , " The dust jacket , please . "                 @ @ @ @
