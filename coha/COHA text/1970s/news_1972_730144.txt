txt Fifty years after Mussolini came to power , the specter of fascism again haunts Italy 's political horizon . The Italian Social Movement , or MSI , a party embracing various right-wing extremists and neo-Fascists , appears to hold the key to Sunday 's crucial election and , possibly , to Italy 's future . The MSI has about 5% of the seats in parliament , but it 's expected to register substantial gains , probably at the expense of the leading Christian Democrats . " We may double our seats , " mildly claims Giorgio Almirante , the MSI leader . " We have millions of supporters , the small people and the middle-class . " Even doubling their seats in parliament , of course , would n't mean a Fascist takeover of Italy . Such gains would , however , drastically decrease the chances of a workable parliamentary coalition and , indeed , a workable government . And the reason this election is crucial for Italy 's future is because the country 's problems ? particularly a faltering economy , and a desperate need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population shift from the countryside to the cities  --  require action that can only be accomplished by a stable government . Mr. Almirante , urbane and reasonable , hardly sounds like a rabble-rouser . Although MSI members have fought bloody street battles with the leftists , he has ordered his followers not to provoke fights as his party strives for respectability . He blames the violence and bombings that have marked this campaign solely on left-wing extremists . The black-shirted toughs , so reminiscent of Mussolini , have disappeared from MSI rallies . The black nee-Fascist flag in Mr. Almirante 's office is n't publicly displayed . Rallying the Silent Majority " But when we 're attacked , we must defend ourselves , " he says . Recently , his summer home was bombed . And , almost inevitably , there 's violence when the MSI sponsors a rally of the maggioranza silenziosa , the silent majority . Violence also often erupts , somehow , at leftwing political rallies . Riding hard on the law-and-order theme and attacking the Christian Democrats for inefficiency and being too cosy with the Socialists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MSI have struck a responsive chord among many Italians yearning for stability . The MSI scored impressive gains last year in Sicily 's local elections , beating the Christian Democrats outright in one important city . With more than eight parties represented in parliament , the Christian Democrats have n't gained an absolute majority since 1953 . They remain Italy 's largest party with only 39% of the vote . After them come the Communists , with 27% , and various socialist and conservative parties . The electorate is understandably confused : Of 14 parties on the ballot in Rome , six have the hammer-and-sickle as their emblem . The proliferation of political parties has led to 33 governments since the war and the dissipation of Italy 's " economic miracle " of the 1960s in a wave of strikes and social unrest . While the strength of the Christian Democrats has eroded , the Communists have made slow but steady gains . They 've ruled Bologna since the war , earning a reputation for efficiency there , and created a bombshell by declaring themselves ready to participate in any new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to go in , " says Giorgio Amendola , a leading Communist in parliament . " It 's the country that needs us . If we do n't , there 'll always be a crisis . We 're needed for a majority government and think we have an important role in the political life of our country . " Military Men and Demagogues Fears of communism , and the country 's legendary political turmoil , seem tailored for a party that promises domestic peace , like the MSI . Polls show that most Italians want " stronger " political figures , and that 's what the MSI offers . Its candidates include Admiral Gino Birindelli , who resigned as chief of NATO 's Mediterranean naval forces to run for office . Another MSI candidate is Gen. Giovanni De Lorenzo , former Italian army chief of staff . Mr. Almirante , who has attracted military men , demagogues and street-fighters into the MSI , remains its chief spokesman and the target of the opposition . A socialist campaign poster pictures him with a Hitler mustache and forelock  --  the resemblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust your future to this man ? " Not only its political rivals fear the MSI . Luigi Ceriani , an official at the Banco . Nazionale del Lavoro , says the MSI will always be a minority party in a democracy but worries over " the danger that a transfer of votes to the extreme right or left from the center parties will make democratic government more difficult . " " The MSI is trying to disentangle itself from its Fascist trappings , " he says , " but it 's only a cloak , a disguise . " Flaunting the Past Mr. Almirante , a minor Fascist official in Italy 's puppet regime at the end of the war , seems to flaunt rather than disguise his own past . " Those who were Fascists then make as if they had never been , " he says . " They all deny it now , but I do n't . I was a Fascist until the end . " He does n't label his politics today but says , " Italy after 1945 has had post-Fascism . " Aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MSI program is rather vague . Mr. Almirante wants a more authoritarian presidency " like that in America " for Italy . Parliament would be more efficient and would be composed " not only of the politicians " but of workers , artists and professional men , , he says . " The president would have authority that does n't exist now , and the government would have stability and continuity , " he says . He 's confident of future gains because " people are disillutdoned with the lack of promised reforms . They do n't believe in the center-left coalition anymore . " At a noisy street rally , the MSI program seems even more ill-defined . Burly young men quietly distribute leaflets stressing that the party otters " an alternative to the system " ? almost exactly the same theme pushed by farleft extremists . But the alternative is n't spelled out . Speakers attack both the Communists and Christian Democrats and praise " the courage of the right . " Most of the quiet spectators are middle-aged , and the steel-helmeted police who are on hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the campaign , there 's something a bit chilling about the rally  --  the blaring martial music , the young men lined up waving Italy 's tri-color in unison . One man hands out a 32-page " battle diary " listing the exploits of the evening 's key speaker , a 45-year-old member of parliament named Giulio Caradonna . Heavy-set and scowling , the candidate is pictured giving the Fascist salute and surrounded by tough beret-clad youths . Not only does the publication reprint numerous attacks calling him a Fascist , but Mr. Caradonna also proudly notes that his father was in Mussolini 's government and that he himself at 16 joined the Fascist puppet state after the dictator 's fall . Mr. Caradonna was sentenced " to a long jail term " by a military tribunal after the war , says the official biography . Then he joined the MSI when it was - formed in 1947 , later taking time off from his political activities to serve another 23 months in jail for fighting with the Communists . The MSI literature , its military candidates and the former Fascists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumors of takeover plots . One magazine reprinted the alleged " plans " of a military coup scheduled to occur after the election . Just as the far-left youths are committed to violence , there are several para-military Fascist groups said to be training in the mountains . Pino Rauti , the founder of New Order , one such far-right group aligned with the MSI , was arrested for a 1969 Milan bank bombing in which 16 people were killed , although a left-wing anarchist has been jailed ( but not tried ) for more than two years for the same crime . Mr. Rauti , an MSI candidate , was released from prison just as the increasing number of " Free Rauti " slogans daubed on statues and buildings gave the far-right a fresh rallying cry . Strikes , Civil Disobedience Bombings and strike violence , of course . have much longer been connected with leftwing extremists here . There 's still shock and speculation over the death of millionaire leftist publisher Gianciacomo Feltrinelli , a victim either of his own bomb or murdered by rightists . And Pietro Valpreda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left-wing Manifesto group 's party ticket here . If he wins , he 'll be released from prison because of parliamentary immunity from prosecution . Aside from that consideration , explains Luciana Castellina , number two on the Manifesto ticket here , " We do n't think parliament is so very important . You do n't have to be elected to be a political force . " The Manifesto group is a pro-Chinese fac- tion that split from the Communist Party here . It currently has five members in parliament , all ex-Communist deputies who quit the official party ; but the radical action group would n't be dismayed if none are re-elected . Its program of rent strikes , civil disobedience and general insubordination is propounded daily in a wellwritten newspaper called II Manifesto , which appeals particularly to left-wing youths . " We 're willing to make bombs , to change the state through violence , " says Miss Castellina. the II Manifesto editor . ( Others share the same sentiments . On a recent morning , a pirate radio station in Genoa broke into a national television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . " For more than one minute , a woman 's voice called on viewers to " avenge the death of Feltrinelli " and to " carry the revolution to the factories , schools , banks and streets . " ) The extremism of the left-wing Manifesto group and the far-right MSI has frightened large numbers of voters  --  and added a decidedly negative flavor to the campaign . The Christian Democrats implore voters to " say no to the Fascists and Communists " by voting for Christian Democrats . " The obvious strategy is to tell voters that a vote for the right is wasted because we 'll never cooperate with the MSI in a government , " says Arturo Pellegrini , editor of the official Christian Democrat weekly La Discussione . A Communist 's Views He predicts that " the MSI will meet with success " in the campaign but Manifesto wo n't be a factor . " The Communist Party is still too powerful for this movement , " he says . At the Communist Party 's large and modern headquarters here , Mr. Amendola says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully one-third of the vote . " Although we were n't in the government , we 've been courted for years for our votes by the Christian Democrats , " he says . " The party said in 1963 it would enter the government , and now it 's time for us to help realize the reforms that are needed . " Mr. Amendola tries to allay 11 fears by joking that " some Christian Democrats say we 're too moderate " and notes that the Manifesto group calls the Commtmists revisionist . The Communists , if part of a government coalition , would n't even press for Italy 's immediate withdrawal from NATO , says Mr. Amendole . " We 're for the withdrawal of all foreign powers from Europe , from the East as well as the West , " he pointedly says . Raffaele Venni , general secretary of the Union of Italian Labor , says that he 's " fairly certain " there wo n't be a government influenced by either the Communists or the far right . The fashionably dressed unionist is concerned that " there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because of Italy 's unsettled economy , he 's optimistic that there wo n't be massive strikes like those of the " hot autumn " of 1969 that disrupted most Italian industry . " I think the unions must take the economy into consideration in making their demands this year , " he says . But Mr. Ceriani , the banker , is less optimistic . With major contracts expiring this year , he 's worried that " disaster " could overtake Italy if there 's any major industrial strife . " There 's always a political danger where conflict is n't only of a political character , " he says . Mr. Ceriani has " little faith in our political class , " he admits . " Our politicians have deprived the Italian people of an efficient government for 20 years . They 've chosen not the best but most servile followers , and it 's difficult to choose between the parties because of the deteriorating quality of our political class . " Despite his pessimism , he hopes that the two-day election on Sunday and Monday shows Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a useful time for elections , " he says . " But not since 1948 ( when the Communists were defeated ) has there been a ' more delicate or important election . "
