Probably not since the days of the ancient Greeks have so many exposed so much to so many . In one short week the naked dash has achieved Olympian , if not exactly Olympic proportions ( see MODERN LIVING ) . Already those first lonely streakers across dark and isolated campuses seem the fusty pioneers of a misty age . The streaking contagion has spread to every corner of the U.S. , spilled across to Europe , gingerly moved out ward in both directions on the age ladder , infected a still minority but growing number of women . What began as a tentative titter at the edge of the national awareness has become one great , good-natured American guffaw . <P> It could hardly have come at a better time . The U.S. , too long assailed by inflation , shortages and Watergate , sorely needed a diversion . Combatting the sour mood was scarcely behind the students ' exuberant rush to take it off ; students have never really needed much of a reason to cavort beyond the incandescent mix of youth , health and spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain the remarkable good humor and even enjoyment of the streaking phenomenon manifested by school authorities , lawmen and the public.With few exceptions , hardly a bluenose is out of joint . Indeed , the only groups that streaking really threatens are nudists and Peeping Toms-it deprives both of their raison d ' tre . More ponderous analyses are already droning forth : the sexual revolution is responsible ; folks are simply grateful that students are no longer rioting or building bombs . But the best explanation may be as simple as the relief afforded by a good belly laugh . What do you say to a naked everybody ? Thanks , we needed that .
