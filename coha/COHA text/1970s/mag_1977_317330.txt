Since 1970 , TIME Diplomatic Editor Jerrold Schecter has been covering the world of Henry Kissinger . His assessment of the man who reshaped U.S. foreign policy : <P> After all the years of high drama , the secret missions overseas , the exhausting negotiations when everything depended upon him , it seems hard to believe that Henry Kissinger will no longer be the U.S. Secretary of State . There will never be another like him-a prospect that pleases his enemies as much as it saddens his admirers . The debate on Henry the K 's legacy is just starting and promises to grow-and grow . He is , as Psychohistorian Bruce Mazlish explains , " one of those figures , like a Churchill or a De Gaulle , who bestride their eras and dominate by the sheer weight of their character . Such figures take on mythical , as well as historical attributes , even in their own time . " <P> The Secretary 's secret diplomacy and his secret-swinger life-style energized the Nixon years and turned them into the Kissinger era . To critics , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's performance was theater and the rest was fiction . " His " balance of power " approach has been attacked as reflecting a static view of the world that overemphasized superpower relationships and squandered American assets without deriving strategic benefits . New York Times Columnist Anthony Lewis has accused him of conducting foreign policy with " cynical brutality . " Kissinger shrugs off attacks with a quip : " Even a paranoid can have enemies . " Some of them , apparently , are real enough . Members of a right-wing extremist group in Israel are said to have put up $150,000 for his assassination . <P> Discussing his record . Kissinger compares the world of 1968 with that of 1976 . When he came to the White House , Berlin was a flash point for World War III , and there were 500,000 American troops in Viet Nam . There was little American presence or influence in the Middle East outside of Israel , no relations with Communist China , and cold-war jargon dominated any dialogue with Moscow . <P> All this has changed . He leaves with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage of the Viet Nam War and Watergate has been contained . Despite the buildup of Soviet conventional forces , the outbreak of a major war seems remote . <P> How much did Kissinger contribute to these changes ? Was he simply a brilliant tactical negotiator , or did he begin building the " structure of peace " he sought and lay the foundations for a " permanent foreign policy " ? In his behalf , Kissinger can mount an impressive case . His design for a global foreign policy included a comprehensive economic , political and military approach with long-term goals . He has sought to explain the new reality that although America is still the world 's greatest economic power and possesses massive military strength , " we no longer enjoy meaningful nuclear supremacy . " For Kissinger , this has meant the imperative of survival : building a process of negotiation and the policy of detente . It has meant playing the Russians against the Chinese while never admitting he was engaging in such a dangerous game .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
