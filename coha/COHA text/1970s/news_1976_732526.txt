txt A possible break in the strike of apartment house employees that started May 3 appeared imminent yesterday as both sides were reported to be considering a formula for resolving their differences . Members of the Realty Advisory Board , representing 1,600 landlords and cooperatives , were scheduled to meet this morning to act on a revised package . Details were not disclosed , but sources close to the behind the scenes discussions yesterday said it included some reshuffling of the recommendations originally made by a special panel named by Mayor Beame . The overall package , these sources said , would still add up to $39 a week over three years , as the panel had proposed , but because of the rearrangement the cost during the term of the contract would be less . How It Could Be Done One way this could be achieved would be for a small increase to be paid in the first year and larger ones in the second and third . In this way , most of the cost would fall toward the end of the contract , lessening the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tabulation , such a rearrangement could save them an aver -- age ? of about . it week over the three-year term of the contract . The position of the striking union , Local 32B of the Service Employees International Union , was not decided , although its // leaders were reported to be leaning toward acceptance if they could do so in line with the original recommendations of the panel . John J. Sweeney , president of the local , has repeatedly emphasized that the union would insist on . $35 in ... wage increases and $4 in benefits . But a shift in the way the various wage increases were paid might provide the avenue for a settlement , sources close to the talks said , with savings to the employers while preserving the basic package . . The panel 's recommendations had called for a $13-a-week pay increase the first year . $12 the second year and $10 the third year . The wage scales of most of the striking service ' employees have ranged from $180.15 to $201.77 a week . Mr. Sweeney said last night that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board and that nothing had been formally submitted to him . A Critical Day Vincent D. , chairman of the State Mediation Board , said that he expected today to be a critical day in efforts to end the strike . " I ca n't believe that the strike can go on much longer , " he said . " Reason must prevail . " Sources among Realty Board members indicated that there continued to be opposition from some in the group to acceptance of the revised package , particularly from those members identified with the Community Housing Improvement Program . This group has been in the forefront of those attempting to keep the cost of a settlement down . But Realty Board sources said that by rearranging . the package to make it less costly in the early part of the contract the wage , cost to the employers for the'three-year term might be cut by $600 per employee . The panel recommendations , accepted last ? week by the union but rejected by the Realty Board , would have cost a total of $3,796 for each employee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board computation . This was calculated as follows : A $13-a-week wage increase the first year  --  or $676 ( $13 for 52 weeks ) for.each of the three years  --  for : a total of $2,028 ; $12 a week in the second year  --  or $624 for each . of two years for a total of $1,248 ; and $10 in the final year for a total of $520 .
