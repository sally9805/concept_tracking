DEAR SIRS : Peter Stern 's description and analysis of events at Stanford this spring " Stanford 's ' Community of Con  --  sent , ' " The Nation , Sept. 7 is bound to provoke contro  --  versy and disagreement among those who observed those events closely . As would any account of complex and fast-moving events , Mr. Stern 's rendering provides ample opportunity for disputing the accuracy of specific facts or the details of analysis . For ekample , Mr. Stern is simply wrong when he reports that the 1969 sit-in began on April 8 , when " the board failed to meet the demands . " The board was not scheduled to meet until April 14 , and the report of a **30;2099;TOOLONG committee on Stanford Research Institute , which the board was to consider , was not available until the middle of the intervening week . Thus the sit-in began a full six days before any action on the demands could conceivably have been taken . One is entitled to conclude from this sequence that its intent was not to protest but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , goes to his central line of argument , namely , that there existed at Stanford something that could be called a " community of consent , " and that the university 's administration was responsible for breaking it . Mr. Stern 's community of consent apparently consisted of an unspoken agreement to allow students to demon  --  strate in any nonviolent manner , no matter how disruptive or coercive . The evidence for this is that two sit-ins , in 1968 and 1969 , had taken place without intervention . What Mr. Stern does not report is that the 1968 sit-in ended only when the faculty , after a bitter and tumultuous de  --  bate , voted by a narrow margin and contrary to the recommendation of its own executive committee and the administration , . to concede essentially all of the student demands , including that of amnesty for those who were sitting-in . The 1969 sit-in , which was larger and longer than its predecessor , ended more ambiguously . The sub  --  stantive results were that classified research was ended , but SRI was sold by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had demanded . More to the point , however , substantially no disciplinary action could be taken against those who had closed the laboratory because they would not identify themselves ( the celebrated " complicity statement " allegedly signed by 1,500 people had never been seen by anyone who might have been able to act on it ) , and partly because those faculty who ' were most willing to make identifications  --  a sizable number  --  were least able to recognize the students involved , and those who were best able were least willing . All of this hardly adds up to a picture of a community united , or even substantially united , on either means or ends . On most questions short of outright violence the divisions were deep and in some cases bitter . This situation explains , I believe , why some students and faculty were so surprised when the police arrived to end the sit-in of April 23 . There was no ambiguity in the event itself ( In deed , the students bad posted lookouts around the campus to warn of the police arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be more accurately described as chagrin when the lookouts apparently failed to notice the approach across severalmiles of campus of two buses and a number of squad cars . ) The police captain who addressed the sit ters-in at about 5:30 P.M. did not " intimate " that they would be arrested , he told them that they would be subject to arrest if they failed to leave . Some simply did not believe what they were plainly told because events of the past two years had produced the expectation that nothing serious would ever happen until destruction and violence had actually begun . . . . The April 23 sit-in had been preceded by three weeks of " trashing " and large-scale night actions between students and police . The administration also had before it examples of escalating violence on other campuses . ' ( Continued on page 308 ) EDITORIALS Cold Comfort Two days after Attorney General Mitchell was quoted by a reliable reporter ( Kandy Stroud of Women 's Wear Daily ) as saying " this country is going so far right you are not even going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published an arresting and disturbing essay by Philip Green of Smith College called " Can It Happen Here ? Is It Already Happening ? " ProfessOr Green opens by deploring the thoughtless , often ignorant , use in this country today of the epithet " Fascist " to vilify those whose words or actions one detests . With a brief but brilliantly evocative history of the two most notorious examples of fascism  --  those of Hitler and Mussolini  --  he demonstrates that the United States has neither the conditions nor the apparatus to make plausible the emergence of anything that could rationally be called a Fascist state . He shows further that the goals of the contemporary Left dissidents , often called Fascist by their more bitter critics , are diametri  --  cally opposed to those of fascism ; and that the radical Right is confronted by no hostile force that is sufficiently powerful to provoke a fully developed Fascist counter  --  attack . It is on this last point that Professor Green is most alarming . Communism , he points out , was a formidable movement in the dying years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their strength and resolved to fight for their interests , in the streets if necessary . In America , by contrast , " The working class is no longer seen as a mortal threat by other social classes ; and blacks are too isolated a minority to con  --  stitute a believable , national menace of the kind that requires a dictatorship to put it down . " If that sounds like good news , such is not the author 's intention . He continues : " What we really want to know is whether there are potential victims whose lives might take on a terrifying quality like that which the European Fascists imposed on similarly situated people . " One purpose of fascism was to crush a fairly strong , well-organized working class . " To do the same to the poorly organized student , hippie ' and black Left in America would simply not re  --  quire the whole centralized police-state , monopoly-party apparatus . All that is required , in fact , is an illiberal national ' administration , a compliant court system , and a timid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not actually encouraging ) a series of local , decen  --  tralized police and vigilante terrorisms . " With that , Professor Green rests his case , concluding with the observation that " can it happen here ? " is per  --  haps the wrong question , that what we should ask is " how long has this been going on ? " In referring to contemporary affronts to American principles , The Nation has studiously avoided the term " Fascist , " not from a reluctance to speak roughly but because we believe the term is counter-effective . It ' is a universal human trait to soften one 's troubles and vices by definition . If you define " real sickness " as cancer , and " real alcoholism " as delirium tremens , then the vast majority are hale and prudent . None of the deeds now being perpetrated in the country ( examples will be found elsewhere in this editorial section ) constitute " real fascism " and none of their agents are " real Fascists . " But there is no comfort in that , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blindfolding the Senate On August 10 the St. Louis Post-Dispatch published a long article by Sen. Stuart Symington under - the title " Secrecy Called Security Threat . " Senator Symington is in a peculiarly favorable position to discuss the effects of military secrecy on the foreign , policy of the United States , and in particular on the relation between the Executive branch and the Congress . He is a former Secretary of the Air Force and the only member of either House who sits on both the Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees . The gist of his article , which is supplemented by Richard Halloran 's " Korea 's Vietnam Troops Cost the U.S. $1 Billion " ( The New York Times , September 13 ) , is that the Senate is shamelessly hood  --  winked by the Executive branch in order that the latter may carry on foreign wars at its discretion , cover up errors and scandals , and flout the constitutional preroga  --  tives of the Congress . And this goes on regardless of the party in power : President Nixon is no more guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's indictment covers a broad area , but one example of Executive duplicity must suffice ? America 's role in Laos . In 1962 Prince Souvanna Phouma was sup  --  plied with military equipment on a modest scale to fight the Pathet Lao , but within two years our fighter-bombers were attacking Communist ground targets and troops , and any civilians in the area . When President Johnson , having got nowhere with his bombing of North Vietnam , suspended his destructive efforts there , he simply trans  --  ferred the operation to northern Laos , in proximity to the Laotian-Chinese border . In 1968 William H. Sullivan , then U.S. Ambassador in Laos and soon thereafter pro  --  moted to Deputy Assistant Secretary of State , was asked to tell the Senate Foreign Relations Committee something about these operations . There just were n't any , he said . The CIA 's Air America carried , some equipment for Laotian aid , but the Royal Laotian Air Force was solely responsible for the fighting . All this time U.S. pilots , flying out of Thailand , were bombing and napalm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ho Chi Minh Trail . Confronted later with this testimony , in which he pre  --  varicated manfully for the Pentagon and his bosses in the State Department and the White House , Sullivan pleaded that he had not been asked direct questions about American air operations in northern Laos . Senator Ful  --  bright observed , " We do not know enough to ask you these questions unless you are willing to volunteer the information . There is no way for us to ask you questions about things we do n't know you are doing . " The Senate , as well as the American people . have been kept in the dark about what was being done . Nor have the citizens and their legislative representatives any idea of why and where the United States has positioned 7.000 nuclear weapons in Europe alone . nor the political and military agreements covering the handling and use of this stu  --  pendous arsenal . The 50,000 South Korean troops now present in South Vietnam , where they shoot up villages ad libitum , have been represented by the State ' Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government for American help in the Korean War . But a secret agreement , drawn up by Winthrop G. Brown , then Ambassador to South Korea and now Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs , has provided $1 billion over the past five years for the hiring of these mercenaries . Another billion poured into Thailand has resulted in various benefits for the Pentagon , including the presence in South Vietnam of 12,000 Thai soldiers whose chief activity is buying merchandise at the PX for resale in the black market . The $36 million for some Philippine military engineers , since withdrawn , is hardly worth men  --  tioning . The big picture is that the United States , together with the Soviet Union the most militarized nation in his  --  tory , exercises its power with scarcely more responsible control or public information than does the Politburo of the Supreme Soviet . I Hold in My Hand ' Sen. William Proxmire and the Department of Trans  --  portation 's expert on the SST , William Magruder , engaged in a debate on the SST before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Answers . Both men are formidable polemicists , and it is likely ' that the audience came away better informed than if it had been watching the ball game . The only reason for commenting on the event is that apparently Mr. Magruder engaged in a bit of the deception in government that is becoming the rule rather than the exception . Owing to well-founded public concern over damage to the environment , Congress recently enacted a law requiring the filing of a report on the environmental effect of federal programs . Mr. Magruder was of course familiar with this provision ; he also knows that the SST is enmeshed in a maze of controversy in this very area . Waving some papers before the camera , he said , accord  --  ing to Mr. Proxmire ( Congressional Record , Senate , S15405 , September 15 ) : " Speaking of pollution , I would like to say again we have complied with the Act on the environment , paragraph 102 , which was submitted to the chairman . . . . " And again , " We have recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  sponse to paragraph 102 . " The audience must have gained the impression that the SST had been cleared of posing threats to the environ  --  ment or , at the least , that the Department of Transpor  --  tation had made a plausible shoWing of compliance . But it had done nothing of the sort . It had submitted a preliminary draft to the Council on Environmental Qual  --  ity , which the council had returned with a request for reworking , additional information and revisions  --  in short , the report was rejected . " It is the council 's position , " says Mr. Proxmire , " that the Department has not com  --  plied with Section 102 of the Environmental Quality Act " ( italics added ) . So it seems that the Department of Transportation is prepared , like the State Department and the Defense Department , to disseminate what Senate Proxmire refers to as " an outright distortion  --  an outright lie . " ? Jails and Courtrooms In the orthodox political view , getting tough is the solution to the crime problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get still tougher . The absurdity of this technique of dealing with the symptoms , never with the disease , is nowhere more clearly - shown ' than in the present trend toward merging jails and courtrooms . It is only one aspect of the progress of the country toward what President Eisenhower called the " garrison state . " As a result of the Marin County Courthouse killings on August 7 , in which a judge , two convicts and a ' 17 ? year-old youth lost their lives , the Mann County District Attorney , Bruce Bales , proposes to hold jury trials inside San Quentin prison instead of in a regular courtroom . In fact , on August 25 a Superior Court judge did conduct a series of routine court proceedings inside the prison . However , the District Attorney is not sure that this would be valid in the case of jury trials , so he plans to prosecute someone in this fashion to ascertain whether the proce  --  dure is practical and legal . Of course to carry the matter to the appeals level he must first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a conviction . The defendant , though a convict , will be presumed to be innocent of the current charge till proved guilty , but will not the surroundings and atmosphere of such a trial influence the jury ? Will the trial be truly public ? Spectators wishing to observe the proceedings  --  lawyers , witnesses , et al. ? will have to be admitted to the prison and allowed to leave when court adjourns . Other techniques of judicial security are under con  --  consideration . One is to arm courtroom bailiffs , The flaw in this proposal is that he who is armed can also be dis  --  armed or , if he retains his weapon and is impelled to use it , he may inadvertently kill or wound anyone in the courtroom . And why not arm the judge ? In Alameda County recently an infuriated 19-year-old attacked /'a judge who was about to commit him to a mental hospital for observation . The judge and the prisoner grappled on the dais until separated by unarmed court attaches . If firearms had been available , a bizarre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now before the Committee on the Judiciary-would make assaults on state and local law-enforcement officers , firemen and judicial officers a federal crime . The sponsor is Sen. Richard S. Schweiker of Pennsylvania , a Republican . The reasoning behind this proposal is ob  --  scure , To Republicans , especially , local self-government is the very cornerstone of democracy , yet in any crisis , or what may be construed as a crisis , they cry piteously for federal help . The community is likely to be sufficiently severe when local guardians of the peace are assaulted , but Mr. Schweiker feels that as " a symbol of the Estab  --  lishment , " a justice of the peace , say , should receive fed  --  eral redress for a punch in the nose or other molestation . In San Francisco , Los Angeles , New York and other locations " special security " measures are in effect to protect courtrooms , offices of prosecuting officers , and the like At the trial of the Panthers in New York , a policeman or court official sits directly behind each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles has become almost equivalent to a sight-seeing tour of the war room at the Pentagon . Visitors are frisked , handbags and briefcases are searched , everyone must be prepared to identify himself . One can not blame the authorities for trying to protect themselves and pre  --  serve the decorum of the courtroom . but where will it end ? It is but one result of a theory which the Nixon Administration has seized upon as a political issue , that there is really nothing seriously wrong with the country that tough policing will not cure . An ominous thread of ideology runs through the in  --  stances of courtroom turmoil . Even today , one does not look for violence in cases of robbery , fraud . murder which have no overtones of rebellion against the Estab  --  lishment Since the threat of an outbreak is typically associated with the political or social views of the de  --  fendants. the danger of a drift toward a star-chamber state of mind is the greater . If it is to be stopped , the courts , like our other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely defend themselves against effects Welcome , General If he thinks it serves his cause , we see no reason why Vice President Ky should not appear at the base of the Washington Monument and exhort us to win him a vic  --  tory in Vietnam . Clifford Peterson , spokesman for Dr. Carl McIntire , the right-wing preacher and radio hate  --  monger who will be General Ky 's host at the October 3 March for Victory , gave the cogent arguments for the visit in response to questions by a New York Post re  --  porter . Ky , he said . " is much like our Spiro Agnew. - Also , " since we 're so deeply involved ? I , er there . we should be in closer contact. - Agreed . Since American leaders have been meddling in the affairs of Vietnam these many . pitiful years , it is only just that Saigon 's second ranking official should now come over here and meddle a hit in ours . And this " closer contact " may be mutually insti uctive . Knowing the intellectual level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is producing Ky to " stir up the animals . " But the vice president , for all that he may resemble " our Spiro Agnew " in his contempt for dissent , is in many ways a subtle , almost sinuous man . When he stands up there on the platform , and hears the animals roar for blood , he may at last understand why responsible public opinion is sick at heart over the moral devastation that Vietnam has wrought on this country . He may come to see that no administration , however hawkish and primitively anti-Comniunist , can let this go on , that " withdrawal " is not Just a phrase but a policy . And on this side , the hard-hat minds , who would honor America by devastating Asia , may be taken aback by The spectacle of this dapper little ex-pilot telling America 's mobocracy to send more cannon fodder for his aid , com  --  fort and continuing safety . Let them take a close look at the man who is so supremely confident of his hold upon President Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep him at home . But let us all look and listen  --  and not interrupt . It would be a basic mistake to offer any impediment to General Ky 's appearance , and those who share our opin  --  ion of him should not stream into Washington with ob  --  struction as their goal . That is so because if they create a ruckus , the full effect of his presence will be blurred by domestic controversy . For all his veneer of elegance and sophistication . Ky is a rather raw man who , gvien enough scope , can be counted upon to blunder . He has a weakness for such things as declaring his admiration for Adolf Hitler , and he is self-deluded by an arrogance that does not sit well with Americans , particularly when it comes from someone on their payroll It is true that General Ky may embarrass the Adminis  --  tration by lending the presence of his uniform to Dr. Mclntire 's paranoid parade , but administrations have been suffering red faces from Ky for a long time , and it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share the sensation . A hearty welcome to our war buddy , the general from Saigon . The U.S State Department and the Pentagon are con  --  vinced that Japan is now strong enough to take over some of the less , flammable " responsibilities of Amer  --  ican power " in Asia . Japan has demonstrated an ability to do so and is preparing to , an expanded ? role in Asian security . I so conclude from personal investiga  --  tions , plus a careful reading of official statements and interviews with American authorities in the first half of 1970 . This will mean in practice that the United States and Japan will exert complementary power to carry out a joint Asian policy . At first , America will provide the military power , Japan the economic It will he a one-two punch , a continuing and mighty attempt to stop the spread of communism across more of East Asia Gradu  --  ally . Japan will take over more functions from the Americans .               @ @ @ @ @ @
