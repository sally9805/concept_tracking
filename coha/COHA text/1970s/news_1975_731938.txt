txt Blue jeans , says Yale law professor Charles Reich , " express freedom and wholeness of self . " Expressive or not , this modest garment  --  once worn exclusively by the farmer , the cowboy , and the miner  --  is now at home on the world 's most fashionable boulevards , in the finest restaurants , at the most elegant parties . The best estimates place current worldwide production of jeans at a billion pairs a year . Consumers in the Soviet Union , one of the few developed nations where jeans are not manufactured , have been known to pay as much as $140 , a pair for a simple blue denim model which costs no more than $6 to produce . The incredible popularity of jeans , a phenomenon that began building in the early ' 60s and shows no signs of diminishing , has been attributed ? to more casual lifestyles , even to a *desire for blurring class distinction . WHATEVER THE cause , a prime effect has been to transform one San Francisco company from an obscure wholesale house into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levi Strauss &; Co. is the largest single manufacturer of jeans anywhere . It has about 40 per cent of the market in the United States with outlets in 25,000 retail stores . Its international divisions , with factories in 14 foreign countries , is almost as impressive . This is a company that In 1946 was doing $0 million in business , 75 per cent of that as a wholesale distributoi of blue denim . Last year , net sales exceeded $097 million and the company soon expects to join the exclusive list of America 's top 200 corporations . Not surprisingly , Levi Strauss is a company with a passionate commitment to the concept of casualness . " THE LIFESTYLES of the world arc changing constantly , and we try , to , keep up with them , " says ' Walter Haas , the company 's chairman and a great-grandnephew of the greatest gold rush enterpreneur of them all , Levi Strauss . " Jeans are a classless garment , " says Haas , attempting to explain the popularity of his product . " People of all ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're really the great equalizer . " The altering of American lifestyles was the farthest thing from the mind of Levi Strauss , a Bavarian immigrant , as he boarded a New York sailing ship in 1050 and headed , around Cape Horn for the California gold rush . He landed in San Francisco with a large roll of canvas under his arm  --  planning to sell it for tents and wagon tops . Soon after his arrival , however , it was his gbod fortune to encounter an old miner who told him the real need was for a tough pair of pants that could withstand the rigors of the mining camps . HEEDING THIS advice , Strauss quickly set up a small pants shop on Battery Street . One of his first moves was to switch from canvas to a more pllabje tho equally strong cotton fabric originally loomed In Nimes , France , and called serge de Nimes . It was the forerunner of modern denim . A special indigo dye was developed for the fabric the exact color still used for Levi 's basic jean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivets were added to reinforce the pockets . Levi 's jeans soon became the regulation garb for those whose livelihood was carved out of the harsh western frontier . But there it stopped . As late as World War II the fascination with Levi Strauss , and with jeans in general , had yet to cross the great continental divide . Taking note of the baby boom in the late ' 40s , the company gambled , dropped their wholesale business entirely and started marketing jeans nationwide . " I DO N'T THINK I ever figured it would come to this , " says Haas , who along with his brother Peter , the company 's president , was responsible for molding Levi 's into ils present structure . " Basically , what we 've tried to do Is serve society 's needs . " " The consumer still determines what he wants , " says Bud Johns , the company 's public relations director . " We always try to adapt . " This adapting has recently taken Levi 's into a field seemingly incongruous with its lofty position in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knows the fashion ' of youth knows that a used , indeed a beat-up , to-helland-back pair of jeans is infinitely preferable to a stiff new . pair . Desponding to this demand , boutiques have sprung up across the country peddling well-worn Levi 's , sometimes at prices as high as for a new pair . " WE JUST CA N'T believe it says Alfred Sanguinetti , the president of Levi 's jeans division , " but we 're looking at it carefully . " Last year , the company began " recycling " defective jeans which had been returned from a customer and selling them to stores interested in used jeans . One major New York department store bought 5,000 pairs at $4.50 per and took one full-page newspaper ad proclaiming ; " Levi 's  --  Better the Second Time Around . " The recycling operation Is costly and time consuming . Each pair must be inspected employes are constantly amazed at what theyfind in the pockets  --  even a little marijuana on rare occasions , washed , repaired , and sized . " And besides , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place , " says Sanguinetti , shaking his head in wonderment at this newest fad . THE COMPANY Is quick to detect changing styles among young people ; one of Levi 's top executives likes to boast that he attended 11 high school football games last fall . It was this kind of insight which led Levi 's a couple of years ago to start making pants with longer inseams , thereby accommodating the clunky platform shoe . The recession has affected Levi 's as it has every company . Sales are off , particularly to smaller stores which are jittery about making a commitment until they can spot a turnaround . But a miscalculation in inventories two years ago in their European operations left the company overstocked and it taught Levi 's a lesson . Levi 's now professes satisfaction with its level of stockpiles . Their one big advantage in the current economic downturn is their product , a utility garment at a reasonable price . " People are always going to buy pants , no matter how tough things get , " says one officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temptation to diversify , at least for now . They are limited exclusively to pants , shirts , and jackets , roughly 150 million of them a year . With this kind of output , the company 's influence on that indefinable quality  --  lifestyleis enormous . They take satisfaction that the old dress-code battles in schools of the last decade have now , for the most part , been decided in their favor . They are amazed that sociologists are crediting their product with actual changes in attitude by an American public , no longer so conscious of clothes and class . And they see the good days continuing . " Within five years I do n't think any of us in this room will be wearing a tie , " Walter Haas recently told a conservatively attired group of visitors to his sleekly modern office . " I know my own kids and their friends prefer clothing that makeS no distinctions between someone who is wealthy and someone who is poor . I like to think we help fill that need .
