WHO MAKES WAR <P> by SENATOR JACOB K. JAVITS <P> 300 pages . Morrow . $8.95 . <P> Among the many lessons to be learned from the tragedy of Viet Nam , none is more compelling than the need for a U.S. debate on how to control the power of the President to wage war . The Chief Executive must be free to respond instantly to clear-cut attack . But in more equivocal circumstances the national will might be far better safeguarded if Congress reasserted its constitutional authority as the sole branch empowered to " declare war . " If this could be worked out practically , an increasing number of political scientists and elected officials now argue , Congress might also find a way to prevent Presidents from waging undeclared wars . <P> New York 's Republican Senator Jacob Javits has special reason for examining the problem . He opposed U.S. policy in Viet Nam . Yet like many other congressional doves he felt compelled to vote for military appropriations as long as U.S. fighting men were " over there " by presidential order . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The issues that it raises about the way we conduct our national affairs have driven me to the pages of history where I find strange analogies that sound the themes of the present . " <P> Javits ' book notes a steady erosion in the congressional power . In 1793 George Washington issued a Neutrality Proclamation during a congressional recess , thus unilaterally withdrawing the U.S. from any involvement in revolutionary France 's fight with Britain in the face of great popular support for the nation 's first ally . Thomas Jefferson secretly schemed to enlarge the Navy 's operations in the Barbary wars . President James Folk 's reckless acquiescence to annexation fever during the Mexican War created dissent in Congress and among non-frontier voters that , in Javits ' view , stood " unequaled until the war in Viet Nam . " <P> Such early meddling with congressional power bears little direct relation to Lyndon Johnson 's massive intervention in Viet Nam as the Chief Executive of a superpower . The point is that the precedents for presidential activism and congressional passivity were gradually established by many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created what many historians now call the " imperial presidency , " was to cite the Barbary wars as a constitutional defense for his undeclared war against Nazi U-boats in the Atlantic just before World War II . It has been argued that Roosevelt 's early brand of brinkmanship was farsighted brilliance-because it helped prepare the U.S. for a necessary war with Hit ler . None of F.D.R. 's successors , how ever , have been willing to give up the enormous power he acquired as the only President to preside over a global war .
