The Justice Department last week made a proposition that will upset some big owners of newspapers and television stations . In a major policy statement , it urged the Federal Communications Commission to ban single ownership of daily papers and TV stations in the same city ( there are now an estimated 83 such combinations in 78 cities ) . The department 's antitrust division recommended that dual owners be given from five to eight years to unload one property or the other ; it suggested that owners be allowed to trade papers or stations with those in other cities , a move that would allow them to remain in both businesses while cutting back their power in any one community . <P> Department lawyers point to studies showing that ad rates charged by affiliated papers and TV stations run 10% to 15% higher than those demanded when papers and stations are competing for dollars . The trustbusters say that their plan would encourage more independent news coverage ; they also believe it could eliminate a " subtle pressure on editors and reporters " in single-ownership situations " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitious press and broadcast journalists that the road to promotion does not lie with antagonizing the publisher or owner . " <P> The department has already moved to contest license renewals of TV stations that are owned by companies that also have papers in Des Moines , St. Louis , Milwaukee , Minneapolis and Topeka , and it plans to challenge renewals in other markets as well . Joint owners are digging in on the argument that the Justice proposal would , as Broadcast magazine put it , " add few new public voices at the exorbitant price of wholesale dislocation in media operations . " How the FCC will respond , after having dodged the issue for six years , remains to be seen .
