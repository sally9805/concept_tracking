&gt; Sex in the patrol car may be more than just a fantasy of policemen 's wives in the growing number of cities using women cops on line duty . In Washington , D.C. , Officer Peggy A. Jackson , 27 , charges that it is practically a rule of the force that " you 've got to make love to get a day off or make love to get a good beat . " Washington 's 4,200-member police department includes 333 women , about half of whom are assigned to patrol duty with men . No formal complaints have been filed , but D.C. Councilwoman Willie Hardy is investigating several verbal charges of sexual harassment . Though the U.S. Attorney 's office has dropped the case for lack of evidence , the police department is investigating the alleged rape of a woman cop by a sergeant during a stakeout of an office building . All of which suggests that the life of a female on a big-city force is not quite as simple as that of Angie Dickinson on NBC 's Police Woman . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like Peyton Place . " <P> &gt; Israel 's small but vocal band of about 400 active feminists is making an issue of local censorship of Playgirl magazine . Steimatzky 's Agency , a Tel Aviv-based book and magazine distributor , gave up censoring female nudes in Penthouse a year ago , but it still insists on blacking out the male genitals in copies of Playgirl .

" The feminists have filed a suit demanding an end to Steimatzky 's emasculation of the magazine . Since Israel has no pornography law , the courts may well agree . Until the courts act , male employees at Steimatzky 's Agency will dutifully wield their black-magic markers . Says he : " We would n't ask women to do it because it would be tasteless . " <P> &gt; Four years ago , an elderly convicted pimp appeared in a Seattle court for sentencing . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to contribute $3,000 to begin a scholarship fund for prostitutes who want to go to college . " One of the biggest hassles for a prostitute is getting the money for education , " says Jennifer James , an anthropologist at the University of Washington and one of the trustees of the fund . " The only solution seems to be to go back to prostitution or deal with the bureaucracy , and I can see why a prostitute would find it easier to turn a trick than to take on the Department of Vocation . " So far , five women have gone to college with the help of the fund .
