If President Carter 's program to conserve energy is to succeed , U.S. suburbanites-the nation 's most careless squanderers of energy-will have to change their attitudes substantially , and their life-styles somewhat , too . To learn how one representative American suburb uses energy , and how it has responded to Carter 's call for conservation , TIME Correspondent Patricia Delaney went to Hinsdale , Illinois . Then , to see how another affluent suburb takes a different approach to the same problem , TIME Correspondent Barrett Seaman visited Rsrath , outside of Cologne , West Germany . Their reports : <P> <P> At dawn , the mists of spring float over the rolling green lawns of the village of Hinsdale , 25 miles west of Chicago . Petals from thousands of flowering fruit trees swirl down wide , brick streets and settle in pink drifts around sprawling Victorian houses . The casually wealthy suburb of 15,906 seems safe from any kind of drastic change , especially an energy shock . Says Louis Duncan , Hinsdale 's president : " We are individually concerned about energy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it soon be expected to , given the facts of life in Hinsdale , where the median income is $26,340 . While many of the town 's corporate executives pay hip-service to conservation by boarding the crowded Burlington Northern for the commute to Chicago , their wives and children spend their lives in automobiles . To shop in a big supermarket , housewives must drive three miles to Oak Brook . There is no local public transportation system-and none is contemplated . In Hinsdale , where families with two or more cars are the norm , the auto rules not only the road , but life . Among the most popular makes : those big gas guzzlers that Carter is inveighing against . <P> If the young children are not in the family station wagon , they are on the school bus . So many older students have cars that high school parking lots are jammed . As suburban mothers do across the country , Hinsdale 's decry the time they spend behind the wheel . And well they should : they clock between 6,000 and 8,000 miles a year simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife of a psychiatrist and mother of four girls : " Everything is event-oriented with children here . Dozens of full-sized station wagons roll just to get teenagers to their parties . " <P> What with the chauffeuring of kids , shopping excursions , trips to tennis and golf clubs twenty or more minutes away and frequent journeys to summer houses in Wisconsin or Michigan , the gasoline bills are enormous . Mrs. Gibson averages $55 a month for her 1976 Chevrolet Chevelle sedan , which gets 16 miles to the gallon . Her husband spends double that for his 12 m.p.g . Mercedes , which he uses for commuting . John Schmeltzer , editor of the local Suburban Trib , believes that car-buying , if not car-driving , habits are slowly changing . Says he : " People have come down from the huge Cadillacs to Buicks or Oldsmobiles , from a Marquis Brougham to just a Marquis . "
