In acting on Mayor Daley 's order to switch the business to Heil &; Heil , some policies held at the time by another political broker were cancelled in the middle of coverage periods , according to the broker . These disclosures came yesterday amid a mounting furor over the way the head of Heil &; Heil , an Evanston real estate and insurance firm , has come to dominate such political plums as public insurance and equally lucrative court receivership cases . STATE 'S A TT Y. Bernard Carey vowed to investigate the a f f a i r .

" FLANAGAN 'S income as the most popular receiver is estimated by knowledgeable sources to be in six figures . But the big windfall for Flanagan came last year when Daley ordered large amounts of city insurance switched without competitive bid  --  from the Joseph L. Gill &; Co. firm to Heil &; Heil .
