Carter vows that international trade laws will be enforced <P> Only hours after issuing his scorching televised blast against oilmen , President Carter last week dropped in on steel executives meeting with his aides in the White House and gave them a far different message : international trade laws will be enforced . That pledge , mild as it might seem , came a few days after European and Japanese steelmakers had informally offered to restrict exports to the U.S. , and it gave American steelmen some assurance that one of the nation 's basic industries might get a little relief . <P> The occasion of Carter 's remarks was itself unusual : a White House conference on steel , attended by mill and union bosses and presided over by the Administration 's chief trade negotiator , Robert Strauss . That it was called constituted Administration recognition that the steel industry is in bad trouble : rising imports of cheaper steel from Japan and Europe in August captured almost 20% of the American market , causing layoffs of some 60,000 American workers , slicing steel company profits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steelmen have long complained that much of the foreign metal is being " dumped " - that is , sold in the U.S. below the cost of production . But little was done about the problem until two weeks ago , when the U.S. Treasury accused five Japanese steelmakers of dumping carbon plate and ordered them to post bonds totaling $50 million to cover penalty tariffs that Treasury might later assess against their products . <P> Dumping is universally recognized as a violation of international trade law , but Carter confessed to the steelmen that he had been unaware of the problem until last week . Now , the President said , " we 're going to do something about it . " Said Edgar Speer , chairman of U.S. Steel : " We have been assured by this Administration that it would act promptly and aggressively on any antidumping cases brought before it . " <P> How much relief this can ultimately bring to the U.S. steel industry is questionable . The Treasury Department will have to thrash out pricing problems that approach the metaphysical . According to the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steelmakers contend that they are not dumping , just producing steel more efficiently . American mill executives swear that can not be true . Says Speer : " No foreign producers , including those in Japan , can manufacture steel , ship it to this country and undersell our domestic product without engaging in unfair trade practices .
