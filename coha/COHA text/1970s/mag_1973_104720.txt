He looks like a saint and rides like the devil . He is Desmond Sandford ( Sandy ) Hawley , a long-haired , 105-pound Canadian jockey who has just won his second North American riding championship . Once again he has brought in more winners ( 367 ) in a year than all the big-name jockeys : Shoemaker ( 172 ) , Pincay ( 289 ) , Baeza ( 129 ) . Yet Sandy Hawley is little known in the U.S. While other top riders are congregating under the palms at Santa Anita and the Miami tracks , Hawley works the cold , often drear , Bowie meeting in Maryland . There the bettors love him . They should  --  his winning percentage is an astounding 29.6 . There are many who bet on Hawley , not the horse , a considerable tribute inasmuch as the rule of thumb is that the horse is 80% of the race and the jockey 20% . In Canada , Hawley is such a hero that Toronto once celebrated Sandy Hawley Day , going so far as to give the 23-year-old rider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laurel last December midway through the meeting he boosted attendance to such a point that grateful track officials actually named a race in his honor . In hero fashion , Hawley won that event , too . // The Canadian will ride between 1,500 and 2,000 horses in 1973 , hoping to win 500 races , something no jockey has done in a year . ( The record is 485 by Shoemaker in 1953 . ) After Bowie , Hawley plans to head home to ride at Greenwood , Woodbine and Fort Erie , all near Toronto . On off days and nights he will take mounts at Blue Bonnets in Montreal , an hour away by jet . He may come back to the States during the summer and expects to ride at the fall meeting at Laurel . // There are those who declare Hawley has yet to prove himself a top jock , never mind the top jock , because he does not compete regularly at New York or Florida tracks . For all his wins , Hawley 's mounts earned only $1.3 million in 1972 while Pincay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , Hawley did appear as an apprentice one winter at Hialeah and did very well indeed  --  he was the first bug boy to be the leading rider . In Canada Hawley has performed superbly in the best competition . He has ridden in the Queen 's Plate twice and won twice . He has ridden in the Canadian Oaks three times and won three . // Hawley 's style is distinctive , especially in the stretch . He bounces up and down a lot and sits farther back in the saddle than other jockeys . Pictures of a Hawley photo finish often are startling . At first glance it appears that he has lost , because his body is completely behind that of the rival jockey , but the nose of his horse usually has hit the wire first . // As a jockey , Hawley has several notable attributes , not the least of which is courage . Chick Lang , who was Bill Hartack 's agent and who says that Hawley reminds him of the early Hartack , recently remarked in the Daily Racing Form , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very hazardous track which might have caused others to conveniently cancel their mounts . Hawley was spilled twice that day and was pretty well banged up , but he came back to ride his mounts the next day . That 's the mark of a champion . " // Hawley also has acumen . " He can foresee things , " says his agent , Colin Wick . " He 's not perfect . Understand , nobody 's perfect . I 've seen him win races he should have lost and lose some he should have won , but he 's won more than lost . Jim Fitzsimmons used to say that the only difference between a good jockey and a bad one is that a good jockey does n't make as many mistakes . " // For all his mod looks and dress , Hawley is a young man with old-fashioned manners , polite and well-spoken . There are trainers who do n't like the length of his hair , but no one complains of the size of his head for all his success . Hawley 's wife Sherrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the movies and sometimes in real life . A pert , intelligent brunette who used to ride show jumpers in Canada , she met Sandy while working as an exercise girl at Fort Erie . Recently , to Wick 's horror , Hawley joined Sherrie and Kathy Kusner in jumping horses on a Sunday . " Busman 's holiday , " said Hawley . He has been teaching Miss Kusner , a member of the U.S. Equestrian Team who has been riding at Maryland tracks , how to switch a whip from her right hand to her left and to her right again during a race  --  a skill many jockeys never learn . The secret is to use the mouth as the transfer point . // Hawley 's development as a rider follows classic lines . He grew up near the National Stud Farm in Ontario , the son of a lab technician in Oshawa . Despite his size ( 5 ' 2 " ) , young Hawley played every sport he could as a child . In grammar school he was a first baseman and batted third in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In high school he had the audacity to go out for varsity football , but , he admits , " they ran me off after two practice sessions . " In his first and only year of high school wrestling he came in second in the 98-pound class , All- Ontario . // Almost always in the back of his mind was the idea of becoming a jockey , largely because an uncle , Web Bride , used to tell him , " I 'm going to make a rider out of you . " Hawley says , " Up until the time I was 16 , I would bother my uncle all the time , asking , ' When are you going to take me to the racetrack ? ' " // One day Uncle Web called up Duke Campbell , a trainer at the National Stud Farm . Campbell told Uncle Web to bring his nephew over for inspection . When they went , Campbell carefully looked at Hawley 's hands and feet and then announced , to Hawley 's joy , " I do n't think you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance . " // Hawley quit school and began his rigorous training . First he walked horses and mucked out stalls at Woodbine . Then there were weeks of cleaning stalls at the National Stud , turning horses out in the paddocks and bringing them in at night , " just getting used to being around horses . " This was followed by months working as a groom at the tracks for $55 a week . // On his days off as a groom , usually Sundays , Hawley would ask an exercise boy if he could ride a horse around the shed . " I rode bareback , " he says . " Mr. Campbell wanted me to ride bareback , and his reason was that a person can gain better balance learning that way . After he saw me doing this Mr. Campbell was enthused , and he would let me make rounds of the shed with the tack . When I 'd ride by the oldtimers would say , ' Keep your feet forward . ' ' Keep your hands down on the neck . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross one rein over the top of the other and then hold them with your hands . Mr. Campbell began taking me out to a field and teaching me to post on a horse , to stay in time with the animal in a jog . After he taught me that , I began to canter , and he 'd be riding a pony alongside and have a shank on the horse I was on . He 'd let the shank get longer and longer until I was on my own . // " In about a year 's time , I became an exercise boy . And after a year and a half of that , I rode races . I used to ask Duke Campbell , ' When can I ride ? ' and he 'd say , ' I 'll let you know . ' " In late 1968 the trainer put Hawley on a mount at Woodbine . " The horse was called Regal Victory , " Hawley says , " and I wound up fifth . My first winner was Fly Alone . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three lengths . I remember it was on a Saturday with a real big crowd . It was funny that I won on that horse because a rider has to ride five races before he 's allowed to carry a stick . The stewards use this rule , I guess , to see if a rider can control horses well enough without a stick . The first time I was able to use a whip , I won . I hit Fly Alone two or three times . " // Hawley has had almost 5,000 mounts since , but he is not in the least convinced that he knows everything there is to know about racing . He is always trying to find ways of cutting down mistakes . Hawley 's riding style is both an amalgam of techniques he has absorbed from other jockeys and a summation of his own experiences . " You can listen to other riders , " he says , " but you have to find your own style . Riding race after race , you develop a style , and the way the horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Hawley sits down each morning with the Form and goes over the entries carefully , race by race . He tries to figure which horses in an event might have real speed or " cheap speed " and where he is likely to be lying when he makes his move . He also notes track conditions  --  what they are before the first race and how they change during the afternoon . For instance , in a recent race at Bowie , the seventh on the card , Hawley realized the track was getting " greasy " on the inside because horses had been running all day along the rail . So he moved his mount , Zadig , outside in the stretch , where the footing was firmer , and won by a neck . A track official , who is an admirer of Hawley 's cunning , had purposely gone down to the winner 's circle to watch the drive to the wire , and when Hawley and Zadig came on fast at the finish there was Zadig 's owner , George E. Frisco , just another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down exclaiming , " The horse would n't have won without Hawley ! He 's five lengths better than any jockey on the grounds ! " // Before a race Hawley goes out to the paddock where a battalion of bettors watch him mount his horse . The owner or trainer might offer instructions on how to handle the animal , and if they do n't , Hawley is likely to ask if it has " any bad habits . " Warming up on the track as the odds on the mutuel board begin to light up and change , Hawley feels the horse out , " whether he 'll lug in , lug out , whether he 's heavy-headed or has a light mouth , which means he might be very tricky about the mouth . This is important because you have to be ready when you come out of the gate . If you have a light-mouthed horse and he comes out of the gate on his own , he can lose a stride or two if he throws up his head and you pull back on the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep him under control . " // Should a horse be skittish or drenched with sweat  --  the latter a bad sign  --  before reaching the starting gate , Hawley does his best to calm the animal with affectionate pats on the neck and soothing words of " Easy , boy , " or " That 's a good girl . " He wants the horse to be relaxed ; otherwise it would use up energy needed for the race . // When the gate opens , Hawley tries to get his horse " running easily , running into the bit , so the horse is n't used up at all . " In a typical race , Hawley likes to lie back until the ? ths pole . Up to this point he almost never uses the stick . " You wait for the stick until you have to use it , " he says , " and there 's the odd race where I do n't hit a horse at all . " // Around the ? ths pole , Hawley begins to make his move . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the ? ths pole . The move depends on traffic , how the field is bunched or unbundled , and Hawley makes a split-second judgment . There are risks here that a jockey must bear . He might get shut off . There are times , he knows , when he rode a fine race and the gap just closed and he placed second , to the catcalls of the bettors . There are also times , he admits , when with sheer luck he finished lengths in front but knew that he had ridden a bad race . There are also times when he will make the move toward the sliver of an opening between galloping horses , seize the lead , finish first and see the inquiry sign light up . Last year he lost 50 days of riding because of suspensions by the stewards . " You see the opening and you go for it , " he says , not apologizing at all . " There are no rearview mirrors , and you may have no idea that you cut another horse off . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pwwipp " to his mount , a kissing sound that means go . " This is called ' clucking to the horse , ' and when he hears this he starts moving , " he says . Should the horse not respond , Hawley swats him with the stick in methodical fashion , first on the right side of the neck , then under the belly and finally back on the rump . Inasmuch as most jockeys are right-handed , some horses have grown immune to being whipped on the right side ; Hawley then switches the stick to his left hand and begins lashing from the neck to the behind . " This startles them , and they move , " he says . // In Hawley 's experience , horses react differently upon gaining the lead . " Oddly , " he says , " some wait for the rest of the field to catch up . They think the race is over because they 're in front . This may have something to do with the way they 've been trained . There are other horses that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want mud or dirt thrown in their face . " // Going into the stretch drive , Hawley gives a shrill whistle like a doorman calling a cab . He might bellow " Yah ! Yah ! Yah ! " Because of their own roar , the bettors in the stands can not hear the jocks at this dramatic moment , the smacks of the sticks and the clattering of hooves . At this instant , Hawley begins bouncing up and down on his mount in rhythm with the horse 's stride . Because he bounces , he uses a soft-backed saddle so he will not bruise his own backside . " I feel that bouncing moves a horse up near the finish , that it will make his front end stretch out a little better , " Hawley says . " Some horses really will respond to that , especially since I sit back on their kidneys. " // Barring lengthy suspensions or accidents , Hawley is convinced that using this technique he can ride those 500 winners in 1973 . " Riding could get to be a bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a goal , you 've got more to be enthused about . "
