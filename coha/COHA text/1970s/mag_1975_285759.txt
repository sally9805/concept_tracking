LULU THE TOOL <P> Directed by ELIO PETRI Screenplay by UGO PIRRO and ELIO PETRI <P> This is a sharp , jangled , slightly bemused assault on the indignities that capitalism inflicts on the worker , as well as a few other indignities that the worker turns against the bosses . The movie is angry but wry about it , indignant without being incendiary . It is less like a Molotov cocktail , say , than a water balloon . <P> The original title of Lulu the Tool was The Working Class Goes to Paradise , a grand-prizewinner at Cannes in 1972 . There is no good reason why it has taken so long to come Stateside-the diminishing market for foreign films probably has something to do with it-and even less cause for the U.S. distributor 's cutting 28 minutes from the original . Petri obviously intended the film to have a slightly frenetic quality and edited it accordingly , as if to duplicate the nerve-shredding tension of a day in the factory . The additional cutting makes the rhythm of the film even more ragged than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds its source largely in the superb performance of Gian Maria Volonte . He plays the conscientious and eventually disconcerted Lulu with just the right mixture of dumb charm and derangement . It is Petri 's thesis that the industrial state can be located somewhere between depersonalization and psychosis , and Volonte is eminently capable of covering the range in between . His Lulu is a creature of blind dedication with the best production record in the factory . No matter that he comes home too bushed to enjoy the amorous invitations of his mistress ( the wonderful Mariangela Melato ) ; no matter that his energy and commitment make his fellow workers look bad : Lulu slaves away like a man possessed . <P> What possesses him is an empty , aimless ambition that forces him to do his piecework as if by rote . His one source of solace is an occasional visit to a friend , Militina , now grown old and a little crazy , who spends his time in the madhouse giving political speeches and reading a child 's biography of Spartacus . <P> Soon Lulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political , delivers fiery speeches about the necessities of industrial reform , resistance and strike . For his pains , his mistress leaves him and the police beat him up . In politics as in work , Lulu 's greatest quality- his enthusiasm-is eventually turned against him . <P> Elio Petri is a film maker of deft , sar donic talents ( We Still Kill the Old Way , Investigations of a Citizen Above Suspi cion , both starring Volonte ) . Lulu suggests no solutions . Petri takes great joy in the freedom of unrestricted attack and ignores the drudgery of coming up with answers . In fact , he could be counted on to mock anyone who dared to . J.C .
