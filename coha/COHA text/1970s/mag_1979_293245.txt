On the Bench To the Editors : <P> Your fine article " Judging the Judges " Aug. 20 was long overdue . Obviously , many lawyer-judges are unable to police themselves , and people outside the bar are needed to end the abuses . It seems the lawyers and lawyer-judges want to regulate and control everything and everyone except themselves . Earl Wheby Jr . Atlanta <P> I used to resent doctors , now it 's jjudges . At least with doctors it does n't take so long to get a second opinion . <P> Frederick Clevel and Milford , Mich . <P> Rights , civil or otherwise , are not and should never be isolated absolutes . No court can ever protect anyone against the will of the majority . When sufficiently provoked , the majority will attack both the court and the minority and redress any such imbalance . I suspect this realization once prompted a Chief Justice to observe that the court did " read the election returns . " <P> David N. Alloway Upper Montclair , N.J. <P> Honestly , I am more afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Jim Peterson Ringsted , Iowa <P> To relieve case loads in the courts , legislators should be required to eliminate an old law before legislating a new one . <P> Frank Zaic Northridge , Calif . <P> Young 's Exit In letting Andrew Young go Aug. 27 , the White House lost the best Ambassador to the United Nations in recent memory . For a brief period , he made the U.N . newsworthy , gained some valuable good will in the Third World and rediscovered a weapon that modern diplomacy has forgotten : speaking the truth . Even the diplomats will be sorry to see him go . <P> Nicholas H. Morgan Charlottesville , Va . <P> The talks with the P.L.O . that brought about Young 's departure will become the official policy of the U.S. <P> June Clark Chicago <P> Of course he should have been fired - he is n't the President , is he ? <P> Don E. Barman Harrisonburg , Va . <P> Who would be a better candidate for the U.N . Ambassador than Sammy Davis Jr. ? He 's black , Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> A Chat with Arafat Yasser Arafat in his interview with TIMEAug. 20 rightly implies that the conflict in the Middle East is basically between Jewish lobby dollars and Arab oil wealth . Can any American politician risk alienating either ? As long as the legitimate aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians are ignored , the Middle East will remain a powder keg . <P> Catherine Mullally Seattle I just returned from a kibbutz near Israel 's border with Lebanon . During my stay we received a gift from the P.L.O . - a bomb . Fortunately no one was hurt , but that was not their intent . To grant the P.L.O . self-determination is a step toward the elimination of Israel . <P> Jory Vernon Downsview , Ont . <P> Hooray for Yasser Arafat for his super remark : " The real terror is the occupation itself .
