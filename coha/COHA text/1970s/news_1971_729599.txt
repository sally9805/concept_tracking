txt From the photographs and interviews flowing Westward lately , one might assume that Premier Chou En-lai is running the People 's Republic of China almost single-handedly. - - Intelligence sources here dispute that theory , however . They say that although the moderate , pragmatic policies he favors currently prevail , he is by no means alone in deciding to follow them . Although Mao Tse-tung , lifetime Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party , is the other name most familiar to Westerners , it is generally conceded here that he no longer wields the policy influence he once did . His preoccupation with ideology and reform suffered a strong setback in the course of the " cultural revolution " of the mid-1960 's . Group power seen Technically still first in the governmental hierarchy , he is worshiped with near-religious fervor by millions of Chinese quoting from his famous Red Book . However , China-watchers insist that no one really knows precisely where Chairman Mao stands in the spectrum of practical politics ( some say he is a power broker among all factions ) and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions . One China scholar who contends it is groups rather than a few prominent individuals who decide Peking 's foreign and domestic policies is Dr. William W. Whitson , a retired Army colonel currently with the Rand Corporation here in Washington . In his view , a combination of professional military men and state economic planners ( represented by such relatively rational bureau crats as Chou En-lai ) currently hold the reins . He sees the Maoists or professional revolutionaries , advocates of rapid social change , as the third ' major power group on the mainland , and one now dominated by the other two . Like most China-watchers , Dr. Whitson considers it significant that both Ch'en Pota and K'ang Sheng , the radicals ranking fourth and fifth on the party 's elite five-man standing committee , have virtually disappeared from public view in the last year . Mr. Ch'en , formerly Chairman Mao 's secretary and one who insisted that Sino-American relations could not be improved without damaging Peking 's image as a revolutionary leader , is viewed here as the least influential of the two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party for the last six months . // *U.S. view : Peking no one-man show // Similarly , those most active in the cultural revolution no longer play key roles Ch'ang Ch'ing , the former Shanghai actress who is Chairman Mao 's fourth wife , was once head of the ctultural revolution group . Today she is still listed as one of the top people in the 25-member Politburo but generally regarded as having little influence on policy decisions . Although the Communist Chinese put little stress on formal organization in practice , the ample representation of professional military men in the governmental structure offers some indication of the strong role the military men play in policymaking Dr. Whitson , who is regarded as this country 's leading expert on Chinese military affairs , points out that Defense Minister Lan Piao , Chairman Mao 's designated successor and second in the party hierarchy , is close to Chairman Mao but , like Mr Chou , an excellent administrator Considered even more powerful than Lin Piao is his subordinate Huang Yung-Sheng , chief of staff of the armed forces and a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last few years A stern disciplinarian and the former military commander of the Canton region , he was appointed to the Politburo in April 1969 Military trio It is also considered noteworthy that Chen Hsi-hen , commander of the/Shenyang ( Manchuria ) region and Shu Shih-liu , commander of the Nanking military region , serve on the Politburo . These three men , in Dr. Whit-son 's estimation , represent the great bulk of military power on the mainland . All told , 12 Politburo members are military men Interestingly , the current pragmatic em- phases is reminiscent of Liu Shao-chi , the former head of state who was purged during the cultural revolution when he urged taking the path of economic expansion and money incentives . In the Rand scholar 's view , Peking domestic politics may well be dictating mainland foreign policy moves at the moment The three major domestic factions have varying priorities and policies chosen have to be " sold " inJthe light of these . The Soviet threat to the north , for instance , may well have been used to persuade some Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialogue noted In his view . Peking foreign policy decisions ought first to be examined in the light of what Chinese leaders are trying to say to one another . As an example , he cites the September , 1965 , speech of Lin Piao , which many have referred to as one of Peking 's major foreign policy statements . Its theme was that the world 's industrial powers were being surrounded by rural powers and that the people 's war would be ca **38;575;TOOLONG Whitson points out that no action , other than verbal support for wars of liberation , followed that speech . The Defense Minister was talking to other generals at a time when there was an intense internal debate going on regarding Peking 's proper role in the Indo-China war . The various power groups were trying to decide whether Peking ought to move toward rapprochement with the Soviet Union , concentrating on the American threat in , Vietnam , or put more money into research and development . Mr. Lin 's answer , says Dr. Whitson , was " Let 's stay primitive "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
