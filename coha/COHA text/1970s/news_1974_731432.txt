txt The Federal Trade Commission announced today it is beginning an industrywide investigation of condominium housing . The commission said it wants to find out whether the firms which manage the condominiums or convert apartment buildings have been using unfair or deceptive  --  practices . The commission cautioned that in announcing the investigation it was taking no position on whether law violations exist . But it added it is prepared to take corrective action should the staff uncover violations . CONDOMINIUMS CAN be permanent housing or vacation units in which the buyer owns a townhouse or apartment . Certain other assets , such as recreati9n facilities , are held in common or retained by the developer . Vacation condominium units often are used by the owners only a few weeks every year , with the condominium developer operating the units much like a hotel for the rest of the year . Rising land values , increased overhead for landlords , and the popularity of a second home have combined to spur a rapid growth in condominiums . The expansion has come so rapidly that exact figures have yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association of Realtors estimates there were only 400,000 condominium units in the country in 1970 . LAST YEAR , 218,095 condominium units were built10.7 per cent of the new housing constructed in 1973 , according to the National Association of Home Builders . This year , builders expect 243,200 condominium units will be built , or 15.2 per cent of all housing built in 1974 . And these figures do not include older apartment buildings or developments converted from rental into condominium units . Common complaints of condominium buyers include hidden charges for things such as parking lots , which can increase substantially at the whim ef the developer or manager , and inadequate disclosure of the condition of vital items such as heating systems , roofs , and plumbing .
