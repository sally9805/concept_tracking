txt President Ford 's Project Independence , the U.S. answer to the energy crisis , is to be unveiled Nov. 1 ? but some of the broad outlines are emerging . Federal officials tentatively confirm that the mammoth study being drafted for the President will conclude that : ? The goal of total energy independence for the United States by 1980  --  or even 1990 ? should be dropped . ? U.S. oil imports from Middle Eastern nations should be continued into the 1980 's and beyond ? but such imports should not be allowed to exceed approximately 18 percent of America 's total energy needs . ? Another " age of coal " may lie ahead , with coal resuming its position as America 's No. 1 fuel . ? Nuclear energy faces serious challenges ? on the basis of both safety and economics . ? Offshore oil and gas should be developed quickly as a " bridge " fuel to the future . co Adequate . capital should be available within the United States to fund all its future energy needs . Two officials with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions " are presently only tentative and subject to change before the report is released . // *U.S. oil ' independence ' goal  --  all but 18% // Expert witnesses and FEA officials are in Atlanta this week for the seventh of 10 Project Independence hearings being held across the United States . The Atlanta hearings focus on offshore drilling , deep-water ports , and refinery siting . The project 's final report ? a 36-page executive summary and a 450-page report of findings ? will be released at the White House Nov. 1 . Program Options provided The report will provide President Ford with program options which he may use to guide the United States toward a greater degree of energy self-sufficiency . But from officials here , it is apparent that the goal of total self-sufficiency by 1980 ? an idea once supported by former President Richard M. Nixon ? has been dropped . As one source here noted , there were two things wrong with total independence from foreign oil : " It 's not what we want . It 's not possible . " Purchases of Mideast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic sense , one source noted , but it also will help to maintain current national defense agreements In that region . Continued trade should strengthen both economic and military ties . FEA officials have tentatively concluded that if U.S. reliance on Mideast oil can be held to about 18 percent of total energy needs , the country could survive another oil embargo without even resorting to rationing . Large step seen Duke R. Ligon , assistant administrator for energy-resource development at FEA , says the Project Independence report will be " one of the largest steps toward national energy policy that we 've ever taken " in the United States . But Mr. Ligon suggests that even with good energy policies at the federal level , the days of cheap energy in the United States " are over for good . " The times of " 29.9 cent gasoline " will not return , he says . Coal role looms Congress and the President can take steps , however , " so we never have to experience again what we did during the embargo , " Mr. Ligon says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future energy for the United States : gas , oil , oil shale , solar ( sun , winds , tides ) , nuclear , geothermal , hydro , coal , and synthetic fuels such as coal gasification . Coal , America 's most abundant fossil fuel , appears certain to play a large role . Oil use should peak around 1985-1990 , thereafter sliding to a less-crucial role . Nuclear energy , which was the hope of the 1960 's , has proved disappointing . It faces serious economic questions ; and safety questions are being debated . But nuclear energy still could be a key element ? perhaps the key element ? in future policy . Solar energy looms as a potentially Important source in the long term  --  and geothermal in the even longer term . Other fuels , such as oil shale , appear potentially important but somewhat less significant than other sources . The report also will include a major section on conservation , which officials agree is vital if Project Independence is to be a success .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
