A story by Stephen Dixon STREETS Jacqueline Chwast T wo PEOPLE STAND on the street corner . Or , rather , she stands on the corner . He 's gone into the corner store . She looks up . A jet plane passes . She waves at the plane and laughs . She looks at the cars passing on the avenue . A bus . She waves at the people in the bus . A young boy in the bus waves back . She sees me waiting at the bus stop . She smiles . I smile . The man comes out of the store . He holds out a package he did n't seem to have when he went into the store . She takes the package and puts it in her pocketbook and runs . He walks after her . She sees him walking after her and runs faster . He starts jogging after her . She sees him and begins to run as fast as she can . At least it seems like that . She 's sprinting . He 's now running after her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining on her . She seems to try to run faster than she was going , but she ca n't . She 's in fact slowing down . She 's getting tired . The pocketbook she 's holding might be heavy . I 'm running along the avenue behind both of them . People turn as we run past . They look at the couple and then me as if I know what 's going on . I do n't . As if I 'm part of a threesome  --  this woman , man , and I  --  but I 'm really not . I was just watching them on the corner . Then just the woman on the corner . Then the man leaving the store and holding a package out to her and the woman taking the package and putting it in her pocketbook and running away with it and the man following her , and now he catches up . He tries to take her pocketbook . She pulls her pocketbook back . I stand and watch this from about fifteen feet away . Other people watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she tries to get the pocketbook back , he pushes her . She falls . A man steps over to them and says something to the man who pushed her and holds out his hand to the woman and pulls her up . The man with the pocketbook tells him to mind his own business . The helping man steps back but continues to watch them while sitting against a parked car . The man he 's watching pulls the package out of the pocketbook and puts it in his side jacket pocket . The woman reaches into his pocket . He slaps her hand . She slaps his face . He punches her in the face . She falls , this time on her back . Her head hits the ground hard , and she seems unconscious . The helping man rushes over and begins arguing with the man who hit the woman . The man swings the pocketbook at him and catches him in the face . The woman was only stunned or maybe unconscious for a few seconds . The helping man has a cut on his cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other man tries to knock the knife out of his hand with the pocketbook , but the strap breaks and the pocketbook drops to the ground . The woman takes a handkerchief out of the pocketbook , presses it against the back of her head and stands . The two men are facing one another and shouting , the helping man waving his knife in the air , the other man his fists . " Use it . You just try and use it , " he says to the man with the knife . Several people come over , and others from across the avenue , and almost all of them crowd around the two men and the woman , though giving them plenty of room to move around . I still have n't moved . The crowd forms quickly and so densely around the trio that I can no longer see what 's going on . I hear screams . From women and men . One woman turns around from the crowd with her arm to her lips and looks at me and walks away . Her space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going on . I go over to the crowd , try to get a place in the circle by squeezing between two people , then look over a couple of shoulders to see what 's going on inside . The man who tried to help the woman has his own knife in his chest and is lying on his back . The woman is lying on her front , her face on its side . Blood frames the back of her head , though it could be from the second fall that I saw . The man who hit her then is on his knees . Blood seems to be blotting his dark shirt around his stomach where he 's holding himself . " What happened ? " I say to a man . " Do n't you see ? " " But how 'd it happen ? " " What 's the difference how ? It 's happened . " " Someone should go for the police . " " Good idea . You go . " " And the people there should be helped . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How can I if I 'm going for an ambulance and the police ? " " That 's true . And an ambulance . You 're right , They need one . " " Will someone please go for an ambulance and the police while I try and help these people ? " I say . " I 'll go , " a girl says . She does n't look older than eight . " Someone older ? " I say . There are about twenty people around the trio . Nobody responds to anything I say with even a head shake . I push through the crowd . The man 's shirt is soaked now and he 's groaning . The man with the knife in his chest looks dead . The woman is still bleeding from the head . " Will someone please go for the police ? " I say . " Let the girl go , " a woman says . " I know her . Know her mother , I mean . She 's a smart girl . Rather , her mother says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " another woman says . " Go , girl . Call the police . " " I need money , " the girl says . I put my hand in my pants pocket . Everyone watches me go through all my pockets for change . I look at the crowd nearest the girl . " I thought I had change , " I say . " Sure , " a man says . He gives the girl a dime . " Give her two , " a woman says . " She might lose the first . " " I wo n't lose the first , " the girl says . " I know who to call and how . I dial . I put the dime in . " " You put the dime in and then dial , " the woman says . " I know , I know . I only need one dime . " She goes . I GET DOWN ON ONE KNEE . I do n't know whom to help first . Probably the woman . The knifed man looks dead . If the knifed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident fall on the knife himself , then the man who stabbed him would seem like the last person to help . I 'm not sure about that . All I know is someone has to be helped first . So I pick the woman . Maybe because she is a woman . Though if she 's the one who stabbed the man , then I probably should first help the man who I thought stabbed the man in the chest , though only if I 'm sure the stabbed man is dead . If he is n't dead , then I would n't know which man to help first  --  that is , if the woman is definitely the one who stabbed the man , but not out of self-defense . If she stabbed him out of self-defense or to protect the man who chased and hit her before , then the last person to be helped would be the stabbed man , dead or not , and the first would he either the woman or the man holding his stomach . " Who stabbed who ? " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who 's responsible for all this ? " " I did n't see it . " " I did , " a woman says . " Who stabbed who ? " I say . " Why you want to know ? You a cop ? " " No . I just want to help these people . " " You a doctor ? " " I 'm a passerby , just like you . " " No you 're not . You were running after them before . " " I was running after them because I saw the man chasing the lady , and I thought something was wrong . " " Something was , " a man says . " What happened ? " I say . " You 're the one running after them , and all of a sudden you did n't see ? " a woman says . " No . " " Bull . " I decide to help the knifed man first . At least I can find out quick enough if he 's dead or not . If he 's alive then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except put a support under his head , and then I can go right to the woman or other man . " Will someone please do what they can to make the woman and that man comfortable while I see to this one ? " " Best medicine and treatment in these situations is to wait for professional help , " a man says . " Real doctors or hospital aides , but some-one ignorant of medicine can do more damage than someone not doing anything . " " He 's right , " several people say in different ways . " But I know what I 'm doing . I 'm not in the field of medicine , but I do know how to stop someone from bleeding to death . " " How ? " a man says . " Tourniquets , for one thing . " " That 's for arms and legs , nut the head . " " I said for one thing . ' Another way is pressure points . The neck . There 's one there . They 're all over the body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood vessel that 's cut if you ca n't find the right pressure point . At least let me try . " " Sure , we can let you try , and watch you finish off all three of them before our eyes . Just stay off them . " " I 'm sorry , but I still think it 's best I try . " I feel the woman 's forehead . Put my car next to her mouth . " She 's breathing . " " We said stay off her , " the man says . " Wait for help . " " What I think is someone else ought to call the police for help . That girl might have met a friend or someone and just forgotten about it . " " She 's a good trustful girl , " the woman who said she knows the girl 's mother says . " I 'm not saying she 's bad or distrustful . But younger people  --  particularly around her age , eight or nine or so  --  do get distracted more than adults . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ten-year-olds probably get less distracted than eight- or nine-year-olds , but still get distracted a lot . " " So do adults , " a woman says . " I know . But children more so . " " Children more so . You 're right . Maybe someone ought to go , as he says . You go , why do n't you ? " she says to me . " You seem so interested and reliable . " " I want to stay here and help these people now . " " I think you 'd best be giving help by calling for it than touching them , " a man says . " And out of all of us , you 're the one who seems more liable to do the most trouble if you stay . " " I agree , " the woman says . " I do n't . " I feel the stabbed man 's temple . " He 's alive . " " Too bad , " a man says . " What are you saying ? " someone else says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . He started it , did n't he ? " " No , the other man did . " " It was the woman , " a woman says . " She stole something from the man with the knife in him . That 's why he chased her . The other man just happened to step in . And she took the knife out of his hand , which he only pulled out to protect her , and put it in the stabbed man 's chest . " " I think the woman and the man holding his stomach did know one another , " I say . " You know them ? " " I saw them together . They were standing on the corner of this same avenue three blocks away . The man went into a corner store , and the woman waited for him outside . " " What kind of store ? " " I forget . A jewelry store . I was waiting for my bus . Then the man came out and held the package out for her , or just held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyway , she took it and put it in her pocketbook and ran . The man walked after her . She ran faster . He started jogging and then ran after her . She at first ran faster than him when they were both running , and then , because she was tired or her pocketbook had become too cumbersome to run with or something , she slowed down and he caught up . Right here . I was standing over there . Next to the hydrant . The one where the two dogs are . " I ' 11 STILL ON ONE KNEE and now pointing through someone 's legs . Almost all of them turn to look at the hydrant and dogs . " Then the man took the pocketbook from her , and she tried getting it back . He pushed her and she slapped him . Rather , he hit her hand and she slapped his face and he punched her and she went down . That 's when the man who was knifed stepped in for the second time . Most of you must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told to mind his own business and he did . This time I do n't remember him being told anything . They just argued . And he pulled out a knife  --  the knifed man did  --  after the tither man hit him in the face with the pocketbook . Then the other man must have taken the knife away from him and stabbed him with it , though I 'm only assuming now , as that 's when you all suddenly encircled them and I could n't see what happened . " " That 's not at all what happened , " someone says . " What really happened then ? " someone says . " You did n't see it ? " " I just got here . " " Remember that little girl who went to phone the police ? " " I told you , I just got here . " " Well , there was a little girl of about nine or ten or so who we sent to call for help . " " Ten , " a woman says . " Ten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ridiculous , " several people say in different ways . " I thought we needed a bit of , I do n't know , levity here , what with the grim sight of them lying there and the waiting for help taking so long . But I guess it was in bad taste . " " Very . " While they were saying all this I took my jacket off , rolled it up and put it under the woman 's head . " Here it comes , " a man says . We hear an ambulance siren and look in the street . The ambulance and police escort preceding it pass . " Must be for someone else . " " I really think one of us should try and get the police now , " I say . " Just to remind them , if the girl called , or to let them know , if she did n't . " " Maybe he 's got a point , " the woman who said she trusts the girl says . " I 'll go , " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man says . " What do you mean ? You would n't let me do anything , which is why I 'm volunteering to go . " " You picked up that woman 's head just before . Maybe they did n't see you , but I did . And in her condition you might have done just enough damage to kill her , when if you had n't touched her she might have been saved . " " You do n't know that . " " I say we make sure he stays here and send someone else to call . " " Send anyone you want , but I 'm also phoning for help . " I push through the crowd . I look hack . The circle 's together again around the three injured people . I go into one of the stores nearest the crowd and ask the hardware-store man if I can use his phone . " There 's a public booth a block north of here , " he says . " This is an emergency . " " All I get every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let him use the phone , " a woman at the cash register says . " I said no . " " But it 's real important . Ca n't you look outside yourself and see ? " " Just keep looking for your register-tape error and do n't butt in . " " Do n't you talk to me like that . " " I said shut up , " he says to her . " And I 'm telling you this is as much my store as yours and even more so , as it 's in my name . And I want him to phone for the police for whatever it is that happened out there . " " I better go somewhere else , " I say . " You 're damn right , " he says . " No . Go no other place . Use our phone . It 's mine  --  in my name  --  and in the back there , right down that aisle . " " Use the phone and you 're flattened , " he says , his hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the door . The woman runs after me . " I said you can use the phone . " " But I do n't want to cause any more trouble and also get killed for it . " " Trouble between him and me is nothing new . Besides , he 's a blowhard  --  all wind and words . So use the phone . " " No . " " He 's smart , " the man says . " Now get the hell out of here , sonny . " " Coward , " she says to me . " Idiot ! " she yells at him . He picks up a wrench and comes over to her . " Do n't be calling me an idiot . " " All right . I apologize . You 're not an idiot . " He relaxes both arms to his sides and walks away . " You 're a big moron and stupid son of a bitch . " H E RUSHES AT HER to use the wrench on her , or it at least looks like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ froze before and watched , and now three people are near dead out there . The man runs past me after the woman . I grab the hand that holds the wrench . " Get his other arm and we 'll trip him , " I yell at her . He hits me on the hack with his other arm or hand . I fall . He lifts the wrench over my head and yells , " Meddler , meddler ! " and comes down on my shoulder with it and then my neck . Both times it seemed he aimed for my head . Something in me broke both times . He lifts the wrench again . " Do n't ! " she yells . He turns to her . I start to crawl to the door . He comes after me . " Leave him ! " she yells . He turns to her . I 'm still crawling . He steps over to me with the wrench raised . " Stop ! " she yells . He rushes her and hits her across the face with the wrench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't see where she got him . Somewhere high up . They both fall . They do n't make sounds . I crawl out of the store to the crowd . The ambulance and police still have n't come . I grab a man 's ankle and shake it . He turns . " Oh my gosh , " he says . " What happened ? " " In there . " I ca n't point . " The hardware . Two people are hurt . Maybe dead . The man hit me twice with a wrench and then the woman with a wrench , but she much worse than me . She stabbed him to protect me and herself . Take care of her . Then me . The man should come third . Or rather , call the police , for I never could . Help for all six of us . I 'm sure that girl never called . They would have been here by now . " " He wants us to phone for help , " he says to the crowd . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ile told you . " " I have n't any change . " " Use the phone in the hardware store , " I say . " In back . Straight down the middle aisle . " " You do n't need a dime ? " " Maybe you do . I thought it was n't a pay phone , but maybe it is . But they must also have a regular business phone that does n't take dimes . " " I better take a dime just in ease . " " Two , " I say . " Two dimes , then . " " Two ambulances . For the trio in the street and the couple in the store and me . " " The stabbed man does n't need help anymore . " " The one in the street ? " " Maybe the one in the store also , " a woman says . " That would mean only four people need help , " the man says . " We 'll still need two ambulances if they 're the triple kind , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help either , " a man says . " The one in the street , I mean . She does n't seem to be breathing . " " Check , " I say . " No , just go in the hardware store and call the police . Do n't tell them how many ambulances we 'll need . The ones I 'm thinking of they might be out of . Just say six people are seriously hurt . Also , if some of you would turn me over now and put something under my head . A jacket . But gently . Rolled up , and not the jacket that 's under the head of the woman in the street . " " I would n't touch him , " a man says . " You might do more damage than not . " " Do n't worry , " I say . " I 'm uncomfortable , in pain , and know what I need . I give you permission . " " For his own good I would n't touch him . His shoulder seems broken . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Wait for the ambulances , " several people say in different ways . " Phone , " I say to the man . " I do n't want to go in the store . The man with the wrench might be up and ready to clip the first one to come in . For all we know , you could have been the one who provoked him into using the wrench , and he might think the next person to come in his store is the same . " " I did n't provoke him . I only went in to call . " " Maybe you 're right . The courts will decide if it has to come to that . But I 'm not going in there . Anyone know where the nearest phone booth is ? " " Three blocks south on this avenue , " someone says . " One block north , " I say . " The dime , " he says . " I 'm all out . " Several people search their pockets and handbags. in my shirt pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket the dime I was going to call with before and goes . " I think someone else should go in the hardware store to also phone the police and see about the couple . " " You think he 's going to get distracted like that ten-year-old girl ? " a woman says . " He 's a grown man . " " I know . But I 'd like the double assurance that help will come . " " Look , I know him a long time , that fellow who went . When he says he 'll do something , he does it . " " That 's not the way I see him , " a man says . " He 's owed me i10 for two years now and always says he 's paying up and never does . I 've given up on him and do n't even ask him anymore . " " Well , I know him as a very dependable honest man , " she says . " Always pays his rent on time . Never a bill due on anything for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Two years he 's owed me . For sup-plies . " " Then you better go in the hardware store and call the police , " I say to this man . " Right , " he says . He goes into the store . " You know who you just sent to call the police ? " a man says to me . Several people laugh . " The worst thief of them all . He 's going to steal everything that is n't held down . " We hear sirens . It seems the ambulance is going to pass . A man runs into the street and waves at the ambulance to stop . It 's gone . " Somebody else again must be sick or in trouble , " a woman says . " Or that siren 's on so it can get through traffic quicker , " a man says . " They have that advantage over most of the other cars and use it . " I turn myself over on my back . " You should n't do that , " a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put my good arm under my head . Everything hurts . " You know , it 's possible those people who went to phone could all be unreliable , " I say . " I think someone else should call . " " How many do you want ? " a woman says . " If they are reliable and too many people phone the police , they 'll think we 're cranks or crackpots and never send anyone to help . Three 's enough . " " Three are plenty , " a man says . " Three for what ? " someone new in  --  the crowd says . " Three people have gone to call the police for these four people in the street here and a couple who are seriously hurt in the store . " " Three calls are more than enough , " the new person says . I shut my eyes and wait . ?
