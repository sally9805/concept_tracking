txt President Carter 's Office of Management and Budget is seeking to make drastic cuts in Federal health programs in the next budget , including the elimination of some major programs altogether . A series of documents obtained by The New-York Times shows that cutbacks have been proposed by the office for a broad range of projects , particularly those involving preventive health , support of health education and manpower , drug and alcohol abuse and basic research . In Hundreds of Millions The list of budget recommendations for health systems administered by the Department of Health , Education and Welfare was not complete , and no total figures were available . But the cuts will run to hundreds of millions of dollars if backed by the President , and perhaps even more . Mr. Carter has not yet given his approval to the office 's budget proposals . The health department still can make a final appeal before its budget for the fiscal year 1980 is fixed . President Carter has said that - he is planning to cut back on many domestic programs so as to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also said he wants to increase defense spending , a move some O.M.B. officials have opposed . , A spokesman for the H.E.W . Department said , " We wo n't have any comment on the budget . " Senator Edward M. Kennedy , chairman of the Senate Health subcommittee , when asked about the proposed cuts reSays People Would Pay The Massachusetts Democrat added : , these American people would pay for these reductions with their health . But the budget process is not complete , and I hope the final budget proposal will not reflect these figures . " The working figures of the Office of Management and Budget obtained by The Times indicate that the agency is not only trying to slash health spending in 1980 but is also seeking cutbacks in planned spending for the current fiscal year in some programs . For example , estimated spending by the research institutes of the National IInstitutes of year " allowance " for the year , according to the O.M.B. table , is $2.96 billion , a cut of $160 million . These " rescissions , " as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some Would Get More Some health programs would receive additional funds in the 1980 fiscal year , under the O.M.B. recommendations . Financing to support Health Maintenance Organizations , prepaid , fixed-fee medical services that are supported by the Carter Administration because of their cost savings potential , would receive an allowance of $57 million , nearly double the current level . The Health Care Financing Administration , which is responsible far the Medicare and Medicaid programs , would be allowed $49.1 billion compared with $43.4 billion in the current fiscal year . Medicare and Medicaid costs are considered largely uncontrollable budget costs under the present system . But documents indicate that the budget office is resolved to cut back sharply on many health programs . The working papers show , for example , that it would give no funds at all for comprehensive health grants to the states , now a $90 million-a-year preventive health program . Hypertension , immunization , venereal disease programs and preventive health care for Indians are among the other preventive health programs that may have to be cut back substantially . Grants to states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $57 million for alcoholism projects would be eliminated . Money for health education and training would be sliced back sharply . The O.M.B. is proposing no funds for " capitation " payments , which the Government gives to medical schools for each student . Also eliminated would be " exceptional need scholarships , " which generally are used to help black and other minority students attend medical school . Nurse training funds would also be dropped , following President Carter 's veto of the Nurse Training Act earlier this year . Also apparently dropped was a new program for assessing health technology . The explosion of new technology in health care and its haphazard application is widely regarded as a major factor in soaring health costs . Jay B. Cutler , president of the Coalition for Health Funding , said when asked about the O.M.B. proposals , " It sounds like President Nixon 's budget for social programs reincarnated . It is a complete cutting back and failure to understand the need for adequate funding for human services programs . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
