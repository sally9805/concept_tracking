Compared with those of , say United , the friendly skies of North Carolina-based Wheeler Airlines do not seem to amount to much . The line 's fleet consists of three red , white and blue eight-passenger Cessna 402s . Its route map includes such eastern North Carolina points as Elizabeth City and Morehead City , small towns that were abandoned some time ago by larger carriers . But tiny Wheeler can claim at least two distinctions . Its president , principal stockholder and part-time pilot , Warren Wheeler , 31 , has a unique way of keeping up with the competition : besides being the boss of Wheeler , he is a senior copilot with Piedmont Airlines , a regional carrier that flies some of the same routes as Wheeler . At the same time , the lanky young executive is a black and , so far as he knows , the head of the first and only black-owned scheduled air carrier in the U.S. <P> Postoperative Flight . Wheeler Airlines has 32 employees , including seven pilots , of whom one is black . The common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 29 , who triples as back-up pilot , public relations man and investigator of new route opportunities : " To work for Wheeler , you have to love flying . " That certainly goes for the boss . Last month Wheeler had an appendectomy ; a few days after the operation , with surgical staples still in his abdomen , he flew two round trips between Raleigh and Charlotte , then returned to the hospital for removal of the staples . Others among Wheeler 's staff are equally eager . Recently , when the mini-airline inaugurated midday service from Charlotte to Raleigh-Durham Airport ( Wheeler 's headquarters ) , Pilot Richard Jeffords Jr. , 23 , helped passengers fill out tickets , loaded suitcases aboard the airplane , took the controls on the 60-minute , 130-mile flight , taxied to a stop , and unloaded the bags . Says Jeffords : " It 's all in a day 's work . " <P> Airstruck since boyhood , Wheeler chose flying over the family business ; his father , John H. Wheeler , is president of Durham 's prosperous Mechanics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technical State University after a year , enrolled in flying school in Oklahoma , and got a commercial license at 19 . At 22 , he was hired by Piedmont as one of its youngest-and first black-pilots . A few years later , he took a leave of absence to start a charter flying service , partly with loans from the Small Business Administration . In August 1973 he drew up a schedule and put his single plane to a new use : Wheeler Airlines was born . <P> In its first month , Wheeler flew just 208 passengers ; recently the line has been carrying more than 1,000 passengers a month , mostly commuting businessmen , and revenues are up to more than $20,000 a month . Wheeler , however , has yet to earn a profit . The federal subsidy ( up to $140,000 this year ) that the line receives to provide service to shore and rural areas does not quite cover losses on these routes , although Wheeler has been able to break even or better on its popular and completely unsubsidized intercity commuter schedules . Wheeler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to drop subsidized service altogether at some point . Says he : " It 's holding us back . "
