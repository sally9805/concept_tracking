PEOPLE OF THE LAKE by Richard E. Leakey and Roger Lewin Anchor Press/Doubleday ; 298pages ; $10.95 <P> Everyone has his own idea of how man became man , and of what life was like among the creatures , no longer apes but not yet human , who inhabited the earth more than a million years ago . In 2001 , science fiction writer Arthur Clarke presented ape men who evolved , in part , by murdering those of their neighbors who had not yet learned to use clubs . Cartoonists gave us Fred Flintstone and his pet dinosaurs . The epic movie One Million B.C. offered a grunting Raquel Welch dodging various prehistoric beasts and cave men with something more than evolution on their minds . <P> These views of our ancestors are diverting , and even , on occasion , informative . But even the speculations of more serious anthropologists and behavioral scientists , says Richard Leakey , are far from accurate . The author should know . His own guesses have the ring of authority , and his genealogy is impeccable . Indeed , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lineage-or the books-of the Leakey family . A generation ago , the great anthropologists Louis and Mary first explored the highlands of East Africa in search of man 's origins . Today their son Richard spends much of his time in further examination of sun-scorched barrens in northern Kenya . He has found enough clues to burnish the names of two families : the Leakeys and the larger tribe of Homo sapiens . <P> In 1972 a team unearthed the nearly complete skull of a creature called Homo habilis , a proto-man who flourished some 2 million years ago . The skull , labeled " 1470 " for its Kenya National Museum catalogue number , gave science a new idea of early man 's appearance . People of the Lake provides some fresh ideas about how he lived . The book , written in collaboration with Roger Lewin of the British journal New Scientist , also offers some encouraging speculations on why hominids became humans . <P> An accomplished Fossil Hunter , Richard Leakey wittily probes the remains uncovered near crocodile-infested Lake Turkana . The authors admit that we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 12 million years ago ; all we have are a few teeth and bones . Nor , despite the recently unearthed ribs and vertebrae , is there much more data about Australopithecus , who survived until about a million years ago , then turned down an evolutionary dead-end street and disappeared . But science has learned what happened to habilis . With a brain-half again as big as his neighbors ' , he not only adapted to his environment but evolved . Habilis passed his genes along to an improved model called erectus , who evolved into modern man , a creature Shakespeare more accurately called " the paragon of animals . "
