txt For the first time since the massive Russian grain deal of 1972 , wheat markets in the U.S. and abroad appear to be returning to normal . Which is to say that while supplies of some kinds of wheat remain abnormally small , enough of the golden grain is pouring into world trade channels to cool the speculative fever that pushed U.S. wheat prices up as much as 137% in the eight months ending in February . There 's no danger of a glut reappearing soon ? at least not this year ? but gloom-and-doom predictions of $1 loaves of bread and no more birthday cakes are equally farfetched . The most obvious barometer of this turnabout is prices . Wheat futures in Chicago hit a record $6.45 a bushel in late February , but have since dropped about 35% to $4.21 . Prices have fallen similarly in Kansas City , and in Minneapolis the premiums being charged for spring wheat used to make bread and rolls have been almost halved to 20 cents a bushel , one miller says . Flour prices have fallen , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $11.60 , down 28% since Feb. 25 . Other signs are apparent in the export trade , which is transforming into a buyer 's from a seller 's market . For instance , wheat orders placed with exporters last week by the United Arab Republic called for shipments from whatever country has the lowest price at the time deliveries are to be made from May through September . This practice has been unheard of in the past two years of short supplies . Take It or Leave It Even India , which is running short of food and came into the market this week for an unexpectedly large amount of grain , including wheat , was telling exporters what it would pay  --  take it or leave it . India 's indicated price was , incidentally , several cents a bushel lower than the U.S. market prices , which had risen on news of India 's interest . ( See story on page 20 . ) The basic reason for this transformation is that there is more wheat available than people had thought  --  both right now and later this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , when there was speculation that the U.S. could run out of wheat by late spring , U.S. officials asked major export customers , such as the Soviet Union , to hold off shipments awhile ; they also asked other countries to help ease the supply strain . These requests have paid off . For the week ended March 29 , the Agriculture Department 's report showed no wheat-export clearances to Russia for the first time since July 28 , 1972 . The European Common Market has made more than 45 million bushels available , and France has even more to sell if the price is right , one exporter says . Additional wheat also is coming from Canada and Australia , which just completed harvesting a crop more than twice as big as last year 's . Most of Australia 's wheat already has been sold , filling many pipelines and relieving pressure on U.S. stocks . With the international supply situation thus eased , exporters began unlocking some of the wheat they had stashed away . " A lot of wheat is coming on the market from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sight who had wheat to sell , " says R. H. Uhlmann , president of Standard Milling Co. in Kansas City . He adds : " Many farmers also are selling wheat now to make room for the new crop . " Ebbing Exports ? This sudden flush of wheat has raised some doubts that the U.S. will actually export 1.2 billion bushels by the end of the crop year on June 30 . The Agriculture Department is sticking by that projection , but grain dealers say the outflow could be some 50 million bushels less than that . Looking ahead , the Agriculture Department 's Foreign Agricultural Service thinks supplies will be ample : " Responding to rising world demand and strong price incen. , tives , the world 's output of grains in fiscal 1974.75 could approach ( one ) billion tons for the first time in history , rising 31 million tons over this fiscal year 's outturn . " As a result , the service continues , grain stocks in major exporting countries , which are projected at about 111 million tons by June 30 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fiscal 1975 . Richard E. Bell , assistant agriculture secretary , says recent moisture has improved the outlook for the 1974 U.S. wheat crop and says he sticks with the Agriculture Department 's 2.1 billion-bushel production estimate , up from the 1973 record of 1.71 billion bushels . He adds that ho expects the U.S. to export one billion bushels of wheat in the 1974-75 season , which could be about 200 million bushels more than some trade observers estimate . But the prospect of bigger crops overseas means there will be considerable competition in world markets . There are indications that Agriculture Secretary Earl L. Butz , currently on a swing of Far East countries , is talking to Asian customers about buying more U.S. wheat next season-1n an effort to preserve the billion-bushel export estimate . The Agriculture Department expects the U.S. to have 180 million bushels of wheat left over when the crop year ends June 30 , the lowest carryover in 20 years . But a department economist , Dawson Ahalt , figures that if the harvest is as big as expected , and it export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve at the end of the 1974.75 season could be around 500 million bushels
