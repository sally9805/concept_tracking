txt WITH TONGUE only slightly in cheek . nature writer John Burroughs once remarked , " I was born with a chronic anxiety about the weather . " Burroughs was n't alone . Lots of people worry about the weather . In fact , the subject is so important to some that they pug up the free information provided by the National Weather Service and pay meteorologists to make private forecasts . The folks at Commonwealth Edison Co. are an example . They hired Murray &; Trettle in Northfield , one of three private forecasting services in the Chicago area , to produce a daily series of weather reports to guide the giant utility in producing electricity and deploying maintenance crews . EDISON FEELS the National Weather Service reports are n't detailed enough . On a'steamy summer morning when air conditioners are gulping electricity , it is n't sufficient for Tom Cihiar , head of power supply , to know the weatherman is forecasting rain in the afternoon . Oilier needs to know exactly what time it will rain  --  before or after power demands hit the anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night , John Viera needs to know which of his seven divisions stretching from the Mississippi River to southern Wisconsin should keep crews overtime to repair possible wind and lightning damage . The National Weather Service says it has neither the budget nor personnel to provide the highly specialized forecasts Edison seeks . So the utility pays Murray &; Trettel $28,600 a year , according to Clem Stave , Edison spokesman , to produce the forecasts . EDISON IS ONLY one of nearly a dozen electric and gas companies in four states that Murray &; Trettle lists among its 100 clients , says Jack Murray , one of the founders of the 28-year-old meteorological service . Other clients include Brach Candy Co. , which does n't ship chocolate unless the temperature is right , a taconite mining company that schedules the timing and size of blasting operations according to meteorological conditions , and two major grain companies that want to Imow how weather is affecting crops all over the world , Murray &; Trettle also is " Weather Command " on WBBM radio and Snow Command information center for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Weather Service in Wheeling , started 13 years ago by Earl Flnckle , does weszber forecasting on WIND and four other radio stations around the Midwest . In Ft . Wayne , Finckle tailors the report for farmers , and in Minneapolis for hunters and boaters . Finckle 's customers include the Chicago Cubs and Sox and Milwaukee Brewers because rain affects everything from pitching to concessions  --  or even if the game is played at all . BOTH CENTRAL Weather and Murray &; Trettel also do forecasts for photographers planning outdoor work , builders and road contractors , managers of large buildings concerned about heating and cooling , commodity brokers , lake dredging operations , and just about any other business that worries about the weather . That is , just about any business other than the major airlines and Sears , Roebuck &; Co. , which have their own meteorology departmionts . And the television stations whose m'eathermen produce their own forecasts . Curiously , much of the raw data everybody uses comes from the National Meteorological Center and other federal agencies . There 's no Charge for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive it , MURRAY &; TRETTEL 'S two-story office is crammed with teletypes , facaimilie machines cranking out satellite photos , computers , radar , maps , charts , graphs , and clipboards filled with miscellaneous papers . Jack Murray coyly placed the cost of the equipment at " six figures annually . " John Coleman , who made " hoonies " a household word among Channel 7 weather watchers , said ABC pays about $8,000 a month for the machines he uses to prepare his forecasts . Murray &; Trettel , with 14 meteorologists , and Central Weather , with six , operate around the clock , seven days a week , monitoring the weather worldwide . Some of their customers they will contact up to four times a day with hour-tohour predictions detailed to their exact location ; others they talk with perhaps lees than 12 times a year . THEIR FEES , a closely guarded secret , mostly to keep one firm from knowing what the other Is charging , are based on time and effort . Earl Finale said he will charge $10 to provide a forecast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to five figures a year for a commodity operation . " The airlines prepare their own flight Plans . United 's meteorologists at the corporation 's main office in Elk Grove Village , prepare 2,000 reports a day plus four daily reports on upper-air wind , temperature , and turbulence , two reports a day on runway temperatures , fused in computing safe plane loadsl , and severe Weather warnings whenever winds exceed 35 knots or there is a possibility of icing or storms . American Airlines has meteorologists stationed at O'Hare International Airport and in Los Angeles and New York City . They prepare forecasts 14 hours in advance and- rewrite them every eight hours for an area extending from Hawaii to'the Caribbean . WEATHER FORECASTING as a public service began about 1840 with the invention of the Teletype . Meteorologists know a lot more today and have more tools , but their work still is considered somewhere between an art and an exact science . It only adds to the puzzle when people like the late Mathon Kyritsis , Waukegan restaurant owner , for years accurately predicted mild or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake Michigan , or when Gordon Wimsatt , a New Mexico land developer , achieved a 70 per cent accuracy rate by rendering bear grease in " a secret Indian manner " and studying the oil that formed . Murray &; Trettel and Central Weather will make predictions only five days in advance . Both admit that accuracy declines the further in the future they attempt to forecast . WEATHER CONSULTANTS , Inc. of Mundelein , which has been in business for slightly more than a year and mostly serves agricultural interests , will issue predictions for a year in advance . Daniel says his 70 to 80 per cent accuracy rate " is just as good as the Old Farmer 's Almanac . " Mariann uses practical meteorology combined with tides and moon influences as computed by the naval observatories near Washington and Greenwich , England . Arnold Gambol , one of Sears ' two meteorologists , works with climatology and then plays the odds so Sears knows up to a year ahead how many air conditioners or snow tires to order for each store . But Gambell also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running rampant in late September , Gambell predicted heavy flooding on the Fast Coast . Sears placed a rush order to a sump pump supplier , and the stores in Harrisburg altnost had enough to meet the customer demand , he said . Weathermen frankly admit they are tired of being the butt of jokes , but they tend to remember their successes more than their failures . Like the time Earl Finckle told Leo Duroeher , then manager of the Cubs , it would rain on Wrigley Field at 3 p. m . At 2:55 the sky was sunny . Durocher donned a slicker and climbed out of the dugout . The crowd laughed . At 3 p. m. he reached the pitcher 's mound , and so did the rains . The forecasters say the weather never catches them unprepared  --  or at least , never in public . Early this summer , Finckle went to an outdoor charity auction . He was the only one carrying an umbrella . When the first rain drops fell he leaped to the platform and auctioned off the bumbershoot  --  all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
