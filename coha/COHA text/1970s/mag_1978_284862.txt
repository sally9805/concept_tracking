CORVETTE SUMMER <P> Directed by Matthew Robbins <P> Screenplay by Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins <P> To enjoy Corvette Summer it helps to abandon common sense . In this film there is not a single credible plot development or convincing character . What the movie offers instead is a few benign laughs , some neatly staged action sequences and a bit of appealing moralizing about the evils of materialism . As long as one does n't demand too much of it , Corvette Summer delivers a very pleasant two hours of escape . <P> The film marks the graceful directing debut of Matthew Robbins , who , with partner Hal Barwood , wrote the scripts for The Sugarland Express and The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars . Corvette Summer shares the earlier films ' jaunty , all-American tone . The hero is a recent high school grad , Kenny ( Mark Hamill ) , who leaves home for Vegas after his prized Stingray is stolen . While chasing down the car , he meets up with a prattling , fledgling hooker ( Annie Potts ) who initiates him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually triumph over pimps and car thieves . <P> Though Hamill and Potts are appealing performers , their characters seem too singleminded , and at times simpleminded , for comfort . Their love affair as well as their search for the car are both overtly stage-managed . But Barwood believes in his movie 's every frame , and his sincerity comes across in its exhilarating pace and tender moments . Though Corvette Summer relies on hot air rather than narrative propulsion for fuel , it breezes past the finish line . - Frank Rich
