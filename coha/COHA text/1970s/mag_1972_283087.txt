THE COUNTRY GIRL by CLIFFORD ODETS <P> A successful revival of a play from a former era often says more about the audience than it does about the playwright . Nine playgoers out of ten would much prefer to have their hearts warmed and their curiosities aroused than to have their minds challenged . Clifford Odets knew that . He knew that the public roots for a fallen hero to make a comeback . He knew that playgoers would wonder if an alcoholic could stay sober at a crucial moment in his career . He intuited that every woman in the audience would ask herself if she would suffer and support such a husband or accept an offer of love from a younger man with pile-driving ambition . In every soap opera there is a sudsy whiff of humanity . <P> This production of The Country Girl is a first-class revival that is likely to attract rapt audiences . If that happens , it will not prove that in 20 years Odets has grown in stature , but only that people tend to remain , somewhat endearingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to make a comeback , Maureen Stapleton is the wife to whom he clings , and George Grizzard is the young director with a shark-toothed hunger for fame . <P> In two of three instances the casting is perfect . Robards gives a performance for the theatrical memory book : vain , vulnerable , self-pitying , playful , hung over , a deposed Richard II of the Great White Way who wins back his crown . Grizzard is the perfect foil , an edgy Broadway Bolingbroke with a rapier for a tongue . Unfortunately , Maureen Stapleton still seems to be playing The Gingerbread Lady . She is a jittery bundle of nerves rather than the tough stoic she ought to be , and her matronly appearance short-circuits what should be an electrically charged love interest between her and Grizzard . Nonetheless she is all theater , and-bless it-so is The Country Girl .
