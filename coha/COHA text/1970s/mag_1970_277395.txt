Forgettable used to be the word for the University of Massachusetts School of Education . Like many such trade schools , it trained teachers in stale methods and lacked a complete graduate program . Then , two years ago , the university turned the place over to a frenetic professor of education from California named Dwight W. Allen . Ever since , it has hurtled into experiments that could turn U.S. teachers into models of sensitivity-or cause the school to selfdestruct . <P> The ambitious son of a successful used-car dealer , Allen , 39 , is one of nine American leaders of the Baha'i faith , a Persian religion resembling Unitarianism that advocates world brotherhood and universal education . A Stanford graduate , he joined the ed school faculty there , ran the Peace Corps training program , and continually tried to inspire public schools to break up their rigid schedules . The " modular " class system he advocates-16-to 20-minute periods that can be endlessly recombined for different subjects-is now used in 500 schools , from Temple City , Calif. , to Sarasota , Fla . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( now Chancellor ) Oswald Tippo approached him about heading the ed school , Allen boldly " asked for everything . " To his shock , he got virtual carte blanche-and has used it with characteristic gusto . Draping his portly form in custom-tailored African shirts and guzzling low-calorie colas , Dean Allen first set out to whip up a graduate school . Foundations and the Federal Government agreed with his goal , came up with nearly $4,000,000 . Allen raised faculty salaries to as much as $33,000 a year , signed on historians and economists as well as education professors , attracted 90 new doctoral candidates . Then he popped them all aboard a chartered 707 jet for a week of planning at a camp in the Rockies , where he bulled through his reforms . " A little change hurts , " he soothingly told objectors , " but a lot of change does n't hurt much more . " <P> Heaving out the old curriculum , Allen &; Co. reorganized departments into multidisciplinary " centers " that must rethink their goals every three years or automatically go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching-methods courses , the adventuresome are free to gather credits where they may . In the " humanistic education " center , for example , students and professors join modified encounter groups to pinpoint the elusive emotional problems that may baffle them and the children they will teach . A doctoral student recently got credit for one self-designed unit of " watching Dwight Allen . " Students also practice-teach while living full time in Philadelphia and other cities far from the ed school 's Amherst campus . <P> This week Allen is in Washington at the White House Conference on Children , superselling his suggestion that every school system in the nation should create an " alternative " school " where change is the tradition . " Said he : " Students will no longer tolerate a procrustean system of education . I want useful alternatives and an atmosphere of choice . "
