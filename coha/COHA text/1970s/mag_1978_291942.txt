Their identities will be kept secret until 48 hours before the Super Bowl kickoff . If they are lucky , no one will remember a single one of the six when the game is over . They are the game officials , part-timers , in real life accountants , schoolteachers , salesmen and executives , whose only claim to football fame can be infamy . This year 's Super Bowl officiating crew will be operating in the unwelcome glare of a spotlight created by two highly debatable , and debated , calls made by their colleagues in two crucial games-most notably the A.F.C. title match . Both calls involved plays that when viewed-and viewed , viewed , viewed-in instant replay , appeared to be goal-line fumbles . The combination of televised second-guessing , N.F.L. stonewalling and coaches complaining , perhaps alibiing , has brought the striped-shirt arbiters a notoriety they would just as soon had passed them by . <P> This year 's Super Bowl zebras will , as always , be an all-star cast , chosen by N.F.L. Supervisor of Officials Art Mc-Nally and his staff after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linesman , head linesman , umpire , field judge and back judge who rate number one will get to call the big one this Sunday . Two retired N.F.L. referees who have been there before , Norm Schachter ( three Super Bowls ) and Tommy Bell ( two Super Bowls ) , last week reflected on the techniques and pratfalls of the official 's craft : Schachter on Super Bowl preparation On the Friday before the game , the crew meets with McNally and goes over all the mechanics , just like a pregame conference . They will go over what each guy does in certain situations , the things they have to be careful about . But not the teams ; we never discuss the teams . We never say , " Watch Dallas ' right tackle or Denver 's tight end . " However , if you have been around any length of time , nobody has to tell you about the players . I know them as well as their coaches - their mannerisms , their problems , their strengths . Bell on the pros and cons of instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that ever happened to the pro officials . Whereas before the fans just knew the official was cheating their team , now they run the instant replay and they say , " By gosh , he 's right . " You ca n't beat the old human eye . If the Government was right that many times , the country would be in a lot better shape . Schachter I have no hangup about getting help on a call . But I would n't like to see an official say , " Hey , that was a tough call ; let me see the instant replay . " Schachter on the disputed calls I saw one of them while I was in the hospital . I told the nurse that the official probably wished he was in the hospital with me . Bell on the boo birds Sure , it 's a tendency for the home team ; any time a tough call goes against their team , they are going to boo . That 's natural . That 's what they pay their money for . <P> Schachter I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take booing personally and I did n't want him to take it personally , either . He said , " Wait a minute . I was booing , too . You blew that call . I do take it personally . " From then on , he brought his own ticket .
