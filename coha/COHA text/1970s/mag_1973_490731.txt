THE TALK , OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment FS:ENING to the news on the radio just before Christmas , we heard the newsman say that the United States would " observe the traditional two-day halt in the bombing . " A Washington Post headline referred to it as a " Yule halt . " Since nearly all of this country 's Christmas traditions  --  such as Santa Claus , peace on earth , the Yule log , Christmas carols , stockings by the chimney , mistletoe , giving presents  --  have come from abroad , we 're proud that it has contributed a tradition of its own . A two-day bombing halt is pure Uncle Sam . WAR may seem like an odd place to look for scruples , since wars apparently represent the breakdown of all scruple ; yet the history of war holds as many restraints and inhibitions as the history of peace . Many of these sometimes seem odd and quirky . For instance , in our century we have felt more comfortable using bombs than using gas , and we have felt better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And although no one has maintained that the lives of women and children are worth more than the . lives of men , we particularly want to spare the women and children in war . War may also seem like an odd place to look fur justice , but a sense of justice can survive there , too . A sense of justice is grounded in the mental operation by which a person puts himself in someone else 's shoes  --  most particularly a suffering person 's shoes . Justice is hound up with equality , and the reason is that to imagine yourself in someone else 's shoes you have to imagine him your equal  --  to recognize that he is as much loved by his family and friends as you are by your family and friends , that he is as able to suffer as you are able to suffer . You must acknowledge that he is as irreplaceable as you know yourself to he . In short , you must acknowledge that he is a roan like you . And because you and he are equal , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye , a tooth for a tooth , " and not " Two of his eyes for one of my eyes , ten of his teeth for one of my teeth . " And not " One thousand of their lives for one of our B-52s . " The bombing of North Vietnam offends our sense of justice . Justice wants adversaries to he equal or nearly equal . It abhors a big man 's heating up a child . And when we perform the mental operation of putting ourselves in someone else 's shoes , we do n't want to find ourselves staring up helplessly at waves of B-52s , just as we do n't want to find ourselves strapped to a rack with the torturer approaching . As a nation , we seem to fail utterly to acknowledge that the Vietnamese are people like ourselves . Indeed , we make them disappear from our view even as we kill them , and they lack the means to strike hack and so force us to recognize that they are there . We first erase them from awareness and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of our century 's wartime scruples ( which , it must he said , have been more talked about than honored ) have to do with a sense of justice . For instance , we have a special aversion to killing the wounded or sick in hospitals . We are more protective of the ailing , the dying , and the half dead than we are of the healthy and whole . It is because they are helpless and can not strike hack . They are unarmed men . With them , the inequality in power is beyond argument . They are already threatened from within 1 ) ) wounds or germs , and to threaten them also with bombs seems to impose an unbearable heaping up of misfortune . That is why when , in the midst of Christmas shopping , we heard that our bombers had destroyed the Bach Mai hospital in Hanoi it came to some of us as the cruelest news of all in a week of cruel news : the most helpless people in a helpless country were dying at the hands of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was an event that illuminated the monstrous character of the entire campaign . The disproportion of it  --  and the injustice  --  had become total . HARRY TRUMAN was by no means universally admired by the American electorate , but he was among the few Presidents who have provoked no deep animosities . As far as we can recall , the only national politician who had an ugly word to say about Truman was Joe McCarthy , who seldom meant what he said  --  in fact , was willing to say anything that might get him on the front pages . Those who were antago-nistic to ' Truman 's policies  --  for example , Richard M. Nixon  --  were openly admiring of him as a man of spunk and integrity . And now , too , it is not so much his policies  --  which are still un-der debate  --  as his character that in-spires our respect . His language could he inelegant  --  he once said of Dwight Eisenhower , " That man do n't know as much about politics as a pig knows about Sunday " ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Border hyperbole . Also , Truman was one of the great exam-ples of the Presidency 's ca-pacity for ennobling a man . When he entered the White House , his stand on civil rights was that of a redneck , but in very little time he changed , and took large political risks in doing so . As a Missouri sena-tor , he was indifferent to the welfare state , but when , as President , he thought of the nation 's poor and dis-advantaged in an economic system that had developed large faults , he be-came a reformer  --  a wholly genuine one . Except for the . Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty Or-ganization , there is disagreement now about the efficacy of his foreign policy . Some people assign him much of the blame for Vietnam and other Cold War misadventures , and his decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and ? Nagasaki still haunts the world . Unlike some of his successors , Truman went strictly by the book with the soldiers under his command , and he did not hesitate to dismiss General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular than the President himself  --  for insubordination . There were scandals in his Administration , just as there have been in almost every recent one , but those in his time were trivial compared to some of the later rip-offs . No one challenged Harry Truman 's honesty , and in his nearly eight years in the White House he was the devoted servant of his people . The Touch ELLIS LARKINS , the shy , brilliant , semitransparent pianist , started out life in clear view . He made his debut as a classical pianist at the age of eight , in Baltimore , where he was born and grew up , and his debut as a jazz pianist at the age of nineteen , in New York , where he now lives . The second debut was at Cafe Society Uptown in 1942 , and during the next ten years he slipped hack and forth between there and the Blue Angel and the Village Vanguard as the leader of his own trio , as a sideman with the clarinettist Edmond Hall , and as an accompanist of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maxine Sullivan , Eartha Kitt , Georgia Gibbs , and Harry Belafonte . Then , turning to teaching , vocal coaching , and occasional radio , TV , and recording dates , he disappeared . He came up for air in the late ? fifties , at the Village Gate , with the harmonica player Larry Adler , and he surfaced again in the sixties , as an accompanist of Joe Williams . And last April he began an unlimited engagement at Gregory 's , a bate on the noisy southwest corner of Sixty-third Street and First Avenue . But several things belie his presence at Gregory 's : his diaphanous , elusive , feather-touch style , which is often fogged in by the surrounding din of trucks and talk ; his sliverlike shape , which is further deemphasized by big glasses , a generous mustache , and invariably dark clothes ; and his method of communication , which lies somewhere between the spoken word ( not really spoken but cast forth at random , soft and half-articulated ) and an ingenious and vigorous sign language . When we learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording no fewer than seven largely solo L.P.s under the supervision of the producer Ernest Anderson ( historic , pioneering jazz concerts in New York and Boston in the forties ; publicity work of various kinds in England ever since ) , we went to Larkins ' apartment , which is catercornered to Gregory 's , to find out how he was surviving this encyclopedic task . Freely decoded , this is what he told us : " I was the second of six children , and my mother , who died just last year , did housework and played piano and sang opens mouth , as if singing . My father , who died in 1942 , was a cook and caterer and janitor , and he played violin rapid violin-playing motions with the Baltimore City Colored Orchestra . He taught me piano JANUARY , 1 9 7 3 until I was six , and he was strict Piano-playing gestures with both hands , followed by two emphatic forefinger stabs at a piano standing against one wall of his living room . Then I studied with Joseph Privett , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tallarico , and finally with Gladys Mayo . I went to the Peabody Conservatory , in Baltimore , when I was fifteen , and at seventeen , after graduating from high school , got a scholarship to Juilliard , which I attended for three years holds up three fingers . I had to give a little dissertation before I graduated , but I knew I could n't get up there and talk . I was standing on a corner of Madison Avenue , on my way to the event , when what I 'd do came to me hits his right temple with his right hand : demonstrate the similarities between the melodic lines of Bach and boogie-woogie . The teacher told me afterward that he knew that I 'd made up the whole thing on the spot pulls an object out of the air and shapes it into a ball but that I 'd done it very well . My touch on the piano is probably God-given looks up at the ceiling , just as being able to improvise is . If you play a well-constructed tune , you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it leaks , you patch it and remake it . It 's like improving a house by decorating it and adding wings and windows and such painting and hammering gestures with both hands . My idols in classical music were Chopin and Mozart and some . Beethoven , and I still play them for my own pleasure . My idols in jazz were Fats Waller and Teddy Wilson and Art Tatum and Earl Hines steady piano-playing motions . I 'm enjoying Gregory 's , which I hope I can use as a home base . If it gets too noisy when I 'm playing , I just stop and turn on the jukebox , which I 've had stocked with records by Nellie Lutcher , Ellington , Basic , and Charlie Barnet . The kids twenty-one , and even younger  --  are coming in , and they 're listening cups right ear . Ernie Anderson gives me complete freedom at the recording sessions , and I do n't have any idea shrugs shoulders and holds out hands , palms up what I 'm going to play before I sit clown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 tonight , at the studio over on West Forty-eighth . At seven . Come by beckoning motions with both hands . " We did , shortly before seven , and Larkins was already there . He greeted us in the control room by holding one finger in the air , cocking his head , and saying , " Do n't tell inc where we 've met , " and laughed a prolonged , al-most inaudible sigh . Larkins ' wife , THE NEW YORKER Crystal , introduced herself , and so did Ernest Anderson , who is white-haired , trim , and bespectacled . " I 'm doing this project simply because I want to register some of the great neglected players before it 's too late , " he told us . He and Larkins went over a list of the tunes Larkins had already recorded , and Mrs. Larkins , a short , forthright woman , told us that she and Larkins had known each other since they were seven , that he had accompanied her singing when they were eight , and that they had been married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides . Al Hall , Larkins ' bassist from Cafe Society days , arrived , and was followed by another C. S. alumnus , the trumpeter Joe Thomas , and his wife , the singer Babe Matthews . Larkins went into the recording studio by himself , played some chords , so that the engineer could get his balance , and immediately started a slow version of " Who Can I Turn To ? " The Larkins magic was at once apparent : the delicate , almost inside-out melodic lines , some only a few notes long and some daring refashinnings of Art Tatum arpeggios ; the rich , gleaming triplex chords ; and the easy , no-hands , pedalling rhythms . He slipped into the control room when the take was finished , and the tape was played back . The first chorus went by , and Larkins made an abrupt stop signal with his right hand and said , " That 's it . " He returned to the studio , and Anderson said , " He 's done just about everything in one take , but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What They Used to Be , ' and they 're so beautiful and so utterly different that I 'm going to use them both . " Al Hall joined Larkins in the studio , and they did " The Lady ' s in Love . " Larkins reappeared , and said to Joe Thomas , " Well , you brought your horn . Want to do Little Girl ' ? " Thomas looked puzzled . " Want a Little Girl ' ? " he asked . " I do n't think I know that . Anyway , what key would you play it in ? " Larkins made flat , conciliatory motions with his hands , and said , " I 'll play it with Al and then you come in and we 'll do something else . " " ' Talk of the Town ' Thomas said . Larkins made the 0 . K , Ballantine sign with his right hand . He and Hall played " I Want a Little Girl , " and he and Thomas and Hall did " It 's the Talk of the Town " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can translate what just happened , " Anderson said . " Thomas did n't want to play ' Little Girl , ' which , of course , he knows like the back of his hand . He wanted to play something that every other trumpet player has n't recorded . Ellis got the message right away . " By this time , the control room was bulging . Billy Moore , a guitarist , who had been Larkins ' first boss at Caf ? Society Uptown , arrived with his wife , and after them came art unidentified songwriter and a singer named Emme Kemp . A small bar set up on one side of the control room was being supervised by a raggedy-mustached man in a tweed overcoat and a fur hat , identified only as Freddy . Because of the reflection of the crowd in the glass that separates the studio and the control room , Larkins had become less and less visible . But his music was forcefully and elegantly present . " Sentimental Journey , " " Rose Room , " a ballad with lyrics by Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went by . Joe Thomas , a stocky , heavy-voiced man , let loose six " Beautiful ! " s and an " I hear you ! " during " Sweet Sue . " It was nearly ten o'clock , and Larkins , who had n't been visible at all during the last two numbers , closed the session with " Solitude . " We found him outside the recording studio afterward , and thanked him and said we 'd stop by Gregory 's soon . He nodded , and clapped his hands soundlessly . Turn-0 ifs ONE of the traumas that sometimes befall New Yorkers is to receive in the mail a card from Con Edison saying , " TURN-OFF NOTICE-WE ARE SORRY , BUT YOUR SERVICE WILL BE DISCONTINUED UNLESS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THIS BILL IS PAID BY a date within five days . " It is a frightening card to get , since it seems to come from the same computer that sends out one 's bills and there is no indication that any human thought has gone into the warning . There is no indication , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain a hearing . This problem may be on its way to a solution , for a few weeks ago a federal judge declared that Con Ed 's customers are entitled to a hearing  --  and to a notice of how to obtain the hearing  --  before their electricity is shut off . The principle is known , of course , as due process , and it is explained in an opinion handed down h ? Judge Harold R. Tyler , Jr. , in the case of Bronson v. Con Edison . The facts of this case arc almost a paradigm of everything that can go wrong with Con Ed bills . Mrs. Eloise Bronson , the plaintiff , is a seventyseven-year-old widow who lives herself in Brooklyn , on welfare cheeks and Social Security benefits . In January , 197 ( 1 , she received an electricity bill , covering the four previous months , for twenty-seven dollars and seventy - one cents  --  a figure that she considered far ton high . As her hills continued at this rate , she paid only a portion of the total and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation , which revealed that her landlord had been diverting current through her meter . Despite this finding , Con Ed continued to hill her for the excess amount and threatened to cut off her service , and in May , 1971 , did just that . Mrs. Bronson was without electricity for a month . She sought help from the Legal Aid Society , and , at the request of the Society , Con Ed restored service . She also approached the Department of Social Services , and obtained from it an emergency check to cover the amount that Con Ed WAS demanding . This check was received by the company and credited to her account ; then , somehow , it was lost , and the deficit was restored . Once again , Mrs. Bronson was billed for the excess amount . Once again , she was threatened with disconnection . In June of 1972 , two Con Ed representatives visited her at her home , hoping to collect payment , Mrs. Bronson responded by suing Con Ed on behalf of herself and " all other persons similarly situated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suit is still being fought as a class action . ( Judge Tyler 's opinion only set forth the principle to be followed in a settkment , which is now being worked out by the two parties . ) How do ordeals like Mrs. Bronson 's come about ? Hoping to get an answer , we went down to the Con Edison Building , on Irving Place , and put the question to William E. Wall , the executive vice-president for division operations . Mr. AVall was earnest and informative . " We send out thirty-five million bills a year , " he said . " There is opportunity for error at a series of points . First , our representative has to read the customer 's meter . Now , someone may have switched meters with another apartment , or our man can misread the numbers , or , since he records the . numbers on a mark-sense card , which is then scanned by .1 machine , a mistake can be made in the marking or in the scanning . Inexplicable things happen . There can be mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The customer sends in his check and his stub , and these are received by a bank . The bank is supposed to deposit the check in our account , and the stub has to be keypunched . So there are more opportunities for error . We have about forty thousand incoming personal-service cases a month . Now , when you hear a figure like that , you think the city must he in revolt , but most of these are simple inquiries they 're not really complaints . Our complaints rise as our rates rise . When a customer says his bill is too high , our first response is to make sure his meter is accurate . Now , a meter is like an electric clock ; it almost never goes wrong . We sometimes also inventory the appliances in his apartment , so we know about how much electricity he slinuld he using . If the bill still ca n't he explained after that , there may be no way to tell . A major source of problems is when a tenant moves out without notifying us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on for months , and then we have to come along and ask , ' All right , when did rEu move in And when did hr move out " Mr. 1Vall cast up his eyes . Con Ed is installing a new computer .5 ) stem to help in adjusting customers ' accounts . The system is operating for about a quarter of the city and will hr completely set up by the end of 1973 . Its main advantage , Mr. 1VaIl said , is that whereas the old system required up to twenty-one days to enter a correction in an account , the new system can do it in one day . We went to see the new system in operation  --  on the eighth floor of the building , where Con Ed representatives were answering calls from the Bronx . There were sixty representatives , seated at five U-shaped tables . The walls of the room were painted baby blue , and Muzak was playing in intervals of fifteen minutes on and fifteen off . Each representative faced a small television set with a built-in typewriter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now use for reservations . By tapping out instrucdons on his keyboard , a representative can have the records of an account shown on his television screen and can JANUARY ( 2 . ? 1 9 7 .3 order various services to be performed . Previously , customer accounts were kept on film , and any such order required filling out a form . Neil O'Leary , the manager of Brona customer service , showed us around . He introduced us to one of the representatives , a clean-cut young man named Dennard K. Clendenin , who graduated five years ago from Aviation High School . " Sometimes it 's fun , sometimes it 's tedious , " Mr. Clendenin said of his job . We asked him if customers ever got angry , and he said , " Sure . Srime of them curse and shout . " He smiled . Mr. O'L , Firy placed a chair beside Mr. Clendenin , asked us to sit down , handed us a headset , and invited us to listen in on a call or two . The first caller was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but had just received another one , exactly like it . " Yes  --  well , that was a mistake . Please disregard it , " Mr. Clendenin said . " Seventeen thousand duplicate hills were sent out in the Bronx yesterday , " Mr. O'Leary said to us . " A tape was run through the computer twice . " The next caller , also a woman , had an inquiry about her account . Mr. Clendenin tapped out her account numher , and a small , height " P " appeared on the television screen . Then he tapped out her address , and the words " INVALID STREET NAME " appeared . While she continued to talk , he flipped through a hook of addresses . He found that she had neglected to add " North " or " South " to the name of her street . It was " North , " and when he fed this fact into the machine her account appeared on the screen ; it showed that she had put an extra zero in her account number . The woman asked some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had received five straight months of estimated hills , since she was never at home when the meter reader came around . Mr. Clendenin told her he 'd send a meter reader and tapped nut " AVG MOP , " meaning that there had been a telephone inquiry concerning averaged charges and that he had referred it to the Department of Meter Operations . Then he tapped out " oRm , " showing that he 'd sent an m-der to read the meter . " You see , that has been locked into the computer , " Mr. O'Leary said . " If she calls hack in a couple of hours -- or if her husband calls  --  the representative who answers the phone can bring that up on his screen . " We asked Mr. O'Leary if the system could make mistakes , and he said , " You 've got a human being involved , and any time a human being is involved , you get mistakes . But in the old way a piece of paper could . get lost . This wav , it ca n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a ham-associated with the more cluttered sort of outlying highway , has been thrusting itself upon some real cities lately , and since March of 1972 three McDonald 's Town Houses -- one on 12S th Street , one on upper Broadway , and one ( brand-new ) on Second Avenue at Seventieth Street  --  have opened in Manhattan . Each McDonald 's restaurant , as anyone who has travelled a cluttered highway will remember , has traditionalll been flanked by two enormous golden arches , majestic in their conception , that dwarf the restaurant itself ( while broadening the boundaries of what we call " architecture " ) , so when we went to visit McDonald 's new East Side restaurant the other dal we were disappointed to see that there were no golden arches of any decent size around . There was , on the red-and-white sign above the door , a symbol representing the enormous golden arches , but the symbol was tiny  --  much smaller than the restaurant itself -- and we found it annoying to be reminded , by such a timid symbol , of the flamboyant architecture we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important design elements to look for at a McDonald 's  --  the sign , for instance , that tells how many billion McDonald 's hamburgers have been sold  --  and so we kept on . The first thing we saw was a sign , but it said nothing about billions of hamburgers . It announced that the McDonald 's premises were protected by the Dictograph Sentinel 3 Surveillance System ( from Guardian Industries , Inc . ) . This sign was on the outside door . When we entered , we found that five more such signs had been placed on the five cash registers on the service counter . The restaurant was full . Against a window facing Seventieth Street , there was a counter covered in a wood-like substance . People were standing at 1** the counter eating . A girl with blond hair was eating a Big Mac combination hamburger . A young dark-haired girl in a camel's-hairlike coat was eating an order of French fries . An older woman in a black furlike coat and a white furlike hat was eating an ordinary , classic McDonald 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter , was a big green plant with a red ribbon tied around it bearing a card that read " Best Wishes for Your Success from Highland Construction . " 1 . Ve observed the whole place carefully . We noticed that the walls and supporting columns were clad in a woodlike substance . We noticed that some small chairs seemed to have seats of real wood but hacks of more mysterious materials . We noticed that under the windows facing Second Avenue , and elsewhere in the room , there were upholstered benches of bright yellow punctuated with raspberry tufting . We noticed that to the right , over the service counter , there was a Guardian Wide-Angle Security Camera with a flashing red light and a sign that said " Smile You 're on Camera . " The thing that troubled us was that nowhere did we see the sign that told how many billion McDonald 's hamburgers have been sold . Finally , we found a manager , a man named Floyd Corso ! , and asked him about the sign . " Well , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten billion by now , " he said . " There just is n't any sign , that 's al " On the wal out , we talked to a young man with curly blond hair , an Arms coat , and a long red scarf , who said his name was Howard Lewis . " The McDonald 's experience is a recent thing for me , " he said . " I was out in Colorado . I was on the road and I was desperate , and I saw those golden arches and I freaked out , because I 'd just seen the buttes and all that great stuff . In fact , I 'm planning to go hack to Colorado just to re-create that experience . "
