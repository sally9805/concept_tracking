txt " Tame and correct . " That was the kind of Wall Street lawyer John Marshall Harlan had been , by his own description 16 years ago . It would be only about half right as a description of his Supreme Court years . Mr. Harlan was a correct justice scootarly to the point of awe , impeccable in manner , refined of speech , diligent in professional labor . But his decade and a half on the court was not tame . He was the rebel justice against the " Earl Warren majority , " the fighter for judicial restraint when activism was dominant . He was the only conservative to span the Warren years , and his dissents for himself or , at most , a thin minority embodied the alternative that could not prevail Still , Justice Harlan retires from the court with a substantial legacy for his colleagues and for his successor . He made losing seem gentlemanly , or seem correct , because he adjusted . Though unconvinced , he went along , hoping that he could shape the principles that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in dissent - It would not have been his way , even now , to overturn the Warren years wholesale He did not believe that the American people would insist on a fresh start , a return to the pre-Warren precedents " The American people are a fair-minded people , " he once declared , " whose ultimate support can be counted on for any constitutional decision which , with due regard for the claims of history , is grounded on principles that are manifestly fair and right " They would adjust , he said , because they accept " orderly government " // *Harlan : ' correct , ' yes ; ' tame , ' no // He was not speaking of the transition period through which the court now is about to pass , but he might have been The justices of the probable new majority ? the " Nixon bloc " ? will clearly , and soon , have the opportunity to bring about complete reversals Left with them , tnough , is Justice Harlan 's lingering reminder that any precedents that are to be disposed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room for modification It would be possible , if the new majority chose , to modify the broad changes that the " Warren court " brought to constitutional law , and do so without erasing them entirely . The principles Mr. Harlan himself helped to construct to uphold the precedents of those years allow for adaptation The court of the 1950 's and 1960 's had often rushed to make change , and the speed with which new mandates came out made it difficult to follow a unifying principle each time . But more often than not , it was Justice Harlan who , after the fact , would issue one of his long concurring statements to supply the principle . " Our scheme of ordered liberty , " he commented , " is based , like the common law , on enlightened and uniformly applied legal principle , not on ad hoc notions of what is right or wrong in a particular case . " Recitals of precedent In an unusually large segment of the court 's work in the 16 years he was there , it was his summing-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for what had just been done recently , that often brought the " enlightened " approach he sought The solution of the issues of the day , by the process of law or of politics , would require - objectivity , understanding , patience , willingness to reckon with the just demands of history , and , above all , steadfastness to the orderly processes of our system . " Mr. Harlan preferred that many of the " burning issues , " as he spoke of them , be resolved through the political processes , not the courts He saw " serious mischief " it the view " that all deficiencies in our society which have failed of correction by other means should find a cure in the courts " Yet , as a justice , he did not fight unyield ingly against bringing some of the tough issues into court for settlement And , once they were settled , he was prepared to accept the result rather tnan sugges-t that the issue be reopened He came to feel that the Supreme Court did not need to have its work load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rather , he said , it was the Justices ' oongation to make " wise and sparing " use of their review power , saving the court 's time for its " role as the final federal appellate court . " With his deep-seated devotion to the role of the states as laboratories for social and political experiment , Justice Harlan would have the Supreme Court draw back considerably from involvement with state criminal cases and state and local election disputes . While he leaves the court with an urgent demand that political machinery be returned to state and local control , he also departs with an implied plea that any return to the states of the right to experiment in criminal-law matters be done gradually , in an orderly way that might accommodate most if not all of the facets of " principled constitutionalism " he had helped develop .
