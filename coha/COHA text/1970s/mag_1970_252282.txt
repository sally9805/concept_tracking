Joyful Discovery What is so rare as a young pianist who has a technique that approaches the heroic perfection of Horowitz ? Nothing much . Many a youngster plays that well these days . The real find is the pianist who has the taste and intelligence to keep keyboard dexterity from turning into its own raison d ' tre . <P> Such is Nelson Freire , 25 . A total unknown in the U.S. only a year ago , Freire now ranks as one of the most exciting new pianists of this or any other age . Born in Boa Esperanca , Brazil , and trained in Vienna , Freire made his first big impression in 1966 , when he gave a galvanically Promethean performance of Tchaikovsky 's Piano Concerto No. 2 in West Germany . Last winter Columbia introduced him with a two-LP album on which he played four concerto favorites-the Schumann . Grieg , Tchaikovsky First and the Liszt Totentanz . The album caught the critics by surprise and sent them scurrying for superlatives . <P> Obviously , talent like that had to be brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it turned out , Freire 's was more than the usual debut . He was due to perform the Rachmaninoff Fourth Piano Concerto twice with the New York Philharmonic . But because another pianist , Jeanne-Marie Darre , fell ill with flu , Freire performed the concerto five times in six days . <P> The last evening actually became the toughest of all . After tossing off the Rachmaninoff , Freire tossed on coat , muffler and gloves for a breakneck 25-mile drive to Garden City , Long Island . There , coaxing his cold hands back to life under a hot-water tap , he made his U.S. recital debut . The program was a knuckle-cruncher ( Beethoven 's " Waldstein " Sonata , Chopin 's B Minor Sonata , Bach , Liszt , Villa-Lo-bos ) , but Freire rippled through it as though it consisted only of minuets . If there was a sense of urgency about his playing , that was just fine with Freire . " There should be something of the logic of the moment in the performance , " he says . <P> No Patchwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . His programming preferences lie in the dreamy , picturesque worlds of Schumann , Chopin , Liszt , Tchaikovsky , even Rachmaninoff . Yet he consistently attacks the music with crispness and Mozartian clarity . <P> Despite his precision , when he plays - especially in recording-he seems to be joyfully discovering the music for the first time . One reason is that , unlike most pianists who record today , Freire does not like to splice his tapes together to achieve some kind of Utopian perfection . He prefers the single big line of an uninterrupted movement , and insists on doing the whole piece over even if the performance only goes sour for a single bar . In a recording age of electronic patchwork , such persistence and devotion are rare indeed .
