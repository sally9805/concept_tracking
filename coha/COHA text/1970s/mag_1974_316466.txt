The first professional organization to study paranormal phenomena was the British Society for Psychical Research , founded in 1882 . Among its membership were prominent scholars and scientists - men of unimpeachable credentials and high moral character . They soon discovered and enthusiastically reported on the telepathic abilities of five little girls , daughters of the Rev. A.M. Creery . <P> The mentalist millennium was at hand . <P> Six years later , the girls were caught cheating and shamefacedly admitted that they had fooled the investigators . <P> They were the first in a long series of deceivers of scientists . <P> The society 's next major project was an investigation of two " sensitives " from Brighton , G.A . Smith and Douglas Blackburn . Smith would allow himself to be blindfolded , his ears to be plugged , his body to be thoroughly blanketed ; yet somehow the thoughts of Blackburn reached him . This time , it seemed , the S.P.R. had really justified its existence . <P> When Smith left the S.P.R. in 1892 , no other comparable sensitive could be found . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own eyes ; the evidence was held acceptable . <P> It was not until 1908 that Blackburn admitted deceit . " The whole of these alleged experiments were bogus , " he later wrote . The remainder of his statement has echoed to this day : " Our hoax originated in the honest desire of two youths to show how easily men of scientific mind and training could be deceived when seeking for evidence in support of a theory they were wishful to establish . " <P> The American Society for Psychical Research , organized with the help of Philosopher William James in 1885 , suffered similar embarrassments . Yet it pursued its quarry with vigor . As James had noted , " To upset the conclusion that all crows are black , there is no need to seek demonstration that no crow is black ; it is sufficient to produce one white crow . " But after 25 years of reading psychic literature and witnessing phenomena , James admitted that he was " theoretically no further than I was at the beginning , and I confess that at times I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended this departure of nature to remain baffling . " <P> Other researchers had not been humble or uncertain . Late in the century , a self-styled sensitive named Henry Slade toured the U.S. and Europe making objects vanish and swinging compass needles without the aid of a magnet . He was so convincing that a German scientist published a book , Transcendental Physics , devoted to Slade 's accomplishments . Again , the psychic millennium seemed imminent . But in his biography , A Magician Among the Spirits , Harry Houdini reported that the conjurer was simply a fraud with a dazzling technique ; Slade later confessed that it was indeed all an act . <P>
