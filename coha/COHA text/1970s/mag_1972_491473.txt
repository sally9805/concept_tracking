I have noted in much current American discussion a doleful tendency to argue that the past is mostly a tale of horror , exploitation , oppression , selfishness , hypocrisy , destruction and terror ; that the present is a completely unsatisfactory condition of almost unrelieved injustice and evil ; and that the future is not only going to be sinful , but is heading for total disaster . The appropriate reaction is grim ? " Let 's burn the place down , " or " Bury it and start all over again . " Some groups in America may even urge that , instead of a festival in 1976 to celebrate the 200th birthday of the United States , we mark the bicentennial with a massive " cleansing " or cathartic bonfire ? or equivalent violence . In the vernacular , I just wo n't buy this . I am prepared to argue that the last 200 years have been a tale of rather impressive material and technological , and from some points of view , spiritual progress . I am also prepared to argue that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the situation today around the world is fairly reasonable . From the perspective of middle-class American , middle-class European , middle-class Japanese values , the future looks good in the long run . However , many people 's value systems will not fit comfortably into that future , including , in some ways , my own . 1 was raised in Southern California . We were quite poor , but when we went to the beach , we could anticipate such luxurious privacy that if we encountered another party we would often leave in annoyance and go on to a totally empty stretch . When hiking in the high Sierras , if we met somebody on the trail , the day was ruined . The future will not permit that kind of a value system . And it is not because there will be so many people there will be a lot , of course  --  but more importantly because so many are likely to be well off . Poor people do not take up much room . The rich and affluent do . They can travel , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these . This is no overwhelming reason to argue against the masses becoming affluent , but itdoes mean that society  --  particularly the upper- and upper-middle-class portion  --  will pay a price in terms of the privacy it so values . Now , why do so many people in the developed world think the present is so terrible ? In part the current disillusionment is based on misinformation . How familiar is the expression , " half the world goes to bed hungry every night " ? Yet how many people have traveled around the world and seen hungry people in large numbers ' ? The answer , if you have been traveling since the early 1950 's , is that you probably have not . ( Unless you went to a place like Biafra or some sections of India or perhaps a couple of places in Egypt or Ethiopia , or visited some area that had had an unlucky agricultural year . ) The original assertion that a large percent of the world 's people are hungry , or even starving , was based upon an FAO study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the English eat  --  i.e. , 2,800 calories a day  --  you 're hungry . By this definition , the Japanese , who eat 2,300 calories a day , are hungry . But aside from dieters you will not see a hungry face in Japan . By this definition , the Chinese who live on slightly more than 2,000 calories a day , are hungry , but one of the things almost everybody who visits China notices  --  at least in 1971 and 1972 is the incredibly good food available at all levels of society . By this definition , most Indians , who live on 1,900 calories or so a day , would seem to be hungry . But even many rich Indian families have been observed who eat 1,900 calories per day . It is hard to believe they are going hungry . Probably a better hypothesis is that most small people in the tropics tend to live on 1,900 calories or so per day and regard it as natural . But they are not hungry . It is my belief that , white there is still too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 10 percent of the world 's population and that really large-scale hunger was abolished in the early fifties . If luck is with us , it will never come back again . Now there is much serious **25;3430;TOOLONG protein deficiency . This lastaffects mainly people who live on root crops , on polished rice , or where the grain has certain deficiencies . It might include from 10 to 20 percent of the world population . We have learned that protein deficiency is both widespread and has more serious effects than we first thought it had . Yet many , including myself , judge that it would be very easy to greatly alleviate or even eliminate this problem -- and that it costs almost no money to do so ? just reasonable programs . Why then do n't we fix it ? I think because we focus too much on the wrong issues- for example , the erroneous calorie issue . But this is aside from the main point . If half the world actually goes to bed hungry every night , there would be something very wrong with the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been . But there is no need to push the panic button- the 50 percent bogeyman is mostly imagination . It is bad enough that we have as much hunger as we do have in the world . There is another misunderstood problem  --  in this case one which arises from excessive egalitarianism . In almost all industrial countries , the upper 5 percent of the population receives about 25 percent of the total national income  --  sometimes 30 , sometimes 20 . The bottom 20 percent gets only 5 percent or so , sometimes 4 , sometimes 6 . This is true in almost all industrial countries  - -  including the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe . Let 's assume that one is very interested , as I am , in improving the welfare of the bottom 20 percent . Of course , every group is normally going to have a bottom 20 percent ; it is normally impossible not to have somebody at the bottom . But one can still improve the standard of living and status of this bottom 20 percent . Unfortunately , being at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the defects of Western capitalist culture , and particularly the United States version , is that if a family lives below acceptable living standards , then the father  --  if he is around  --  is blamed for being at the bottom as if he had necessarily committed a moral crime of some sort . This does hurt . My own belief is that many a fatherless family among the hard-core poor in America arises from this shame  --  the father can not bear the pressure , and he simply walks out . Assume now that we are trying to help the people at the bottom ; one way would be to double the income everywhere . Then the rich would benefit more than the poor . Indeed , relative to the 20 percent at the bottom , the 5 percent at the top will get about 5 times as much of the increased income and about 20 times as much gain per income unit . Have we done anything useful ? Well , yes . We have doubled the income of the 20 percent at the bottom  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to enjoy it . But let me give another and less controversial side of this phenomenon  --  but still one which is completely misunderstood by 90 percent of the people discussing and writing on the subject . A standard speech made almost everywhere points out that the developed world makes approximately $2,000 per capita , and the less developed world , about $200 per capita . The gap is $1,800 . If you double everything , the gap is also doubled and increased to $3,600 . The argument goes that you are now worse off than you were before . Is this correct ? Obviously not . The people at the bottom went from $200 to $400 , and they like it . In fact , I would doubt that there is a single peasant , a single worker , or very many businessmen ( I am here excluding many academicians , many government officials and some businessmen ) in Latin America , Africa , or Asia who gives a damn about what Americans , Europeans , Japanese , or Russians make . They just do n't care . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rare to find people who care about the quantitative size of their numerical gap . In many countries , the bottom resents the top . In the United States , that has typically not been true . But in both cases , whether or not they resent somebody having more than they have , this resentment is not much increased or decreased as the gap is increased or decreased  --  so long as an appreciable gap exists . One way to see that is to ask yourself the following question : " Have you recently felt depressed because you do n't live as well as a Rockefeller or a Rothschild ? " I have a reason for choosing these two names . I have asked that question many times and few found the comparison relevant . But once there was a Rockefeller in the audience and another time a Rothschild . In both cases they said to me privately , " They are n't depressed ? What 's wrong with them ? " From their point of view almost everybody in the world is living a desperate , deprived life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of your income . But your grandfather probably lived on that and did n't notice he was poor . But for most people who can barely get along on their current income , the idea of living on 20 percent of it is inconceivable . Let us consider another example of such a misunderstanding . In 1960 , the United Nations set a goal for the economic develop-ment of the so-called third world . Their goal called for an average of 5 percent economic growth in the decade of the sixties or an overall increase of about 60 percent in only ten years . This was an unprecedented rate for the third world ; almost no one expected the goal to be met . What they actually expected to happen was that the rich would grow richer and the poor would grow poorer  --  remember that famous remark ? Well , it turned out the goal was exceeded by 10 percent ; the third world succeeded in achieving 51/2 percent . Was there a celebration ? No . Our culture just does n't celebrate this kind of success . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake , a funeral ; we had many speeches about the almost total failure of " the decade of development . " How was this result arrived at ? It was pointed out that the bottom two-thirds , the poorer people , only did 3.9 percent . But this is more than half of all the people . Development has never been uniform anywhere in the world . If the bottom two-thirds does only one percent less than the goal , you are actually doing very well in-deed , and it is a separate  --  a second cause for celebration . But it was then pointed out that there was another reason for not celebrating . Continued on page . 131 continued from page 53 The population increase in this poorer group was 2.1 percent , leaving only 1.8 percent actual increase in per capita income . But that is actually a third reason for celebration . The original expectation was that they would get poorer because of the population growth . Now the goal set for the next decade is 6 percent . Since nothing has changed , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results will happen  --  even if we meet the goal . Let us start describing this world of the future . First , how many people will there be ? I spend a lot of time collecting long-term projections , and I think I have collected every important long-term population projection made in the twentieth century . Not one of them has proved to be respectable . In other words , the person or group doing the projection usually gives a range of estimates to take account of the uncertainty  --  that is , high , medium , and low estimates . In all cases , the actual range proved larger than expected and population came out to be either higher than the predicted high or lower than the predicted low . There are , as yet , no respectable long-term twentieth-century population predictions . But let me try one . If I had to guess , I would say world population will be between five and one-half and six and one-half billion by the year 2000 . The seven and one-half billion estimate for the year 2000 often quoted is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreasonable . How much will this population grow in the twenty-first century ? It is not unreasonable to imagine population growth tapering off and more or less stabilizing at about ten billion or so by the middle or end of the twenty-first century . That is a reasonable scenario . A slightly more likely scenario would be a tapering off of population growth at about twenty billion ; a slightly less probable scenario would be tapering out at about thirty billion . How rich will people be ? Gross world product now grows about 5 percent a year . This kind of trend often has a rather stable inner dynamic behind it and is relatively project-able . I would guess that this 5 percent growth rate will not only continue for some time but may even go up to 6 percent . Presumably though , it will taper off eventually  --  less because people find difficulty in maintaining the growth rate than because they wo n't care so much about increasing GNP . We already see inmany upper- and upper-middle-class Americans , an antimaterialistic bias , particularly among those who already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in the country . Their children who have been raised with this kind of material plenty are even less " hung-up " about it and often reject materialism almost completely . This wealth also has an effect on the rate of population growth . The main reason we think the population growth is going to taper off is that we believe there will be a repetition of the similar experience of the twentieth century  --  that as people get rich , they find that having many children becomes more and more an economic and social burden , at least if they are not extremely rich . ( It is worth noting that the Rockefellers , the DuPonts , the Kennedys , and such extremely rich people still do have a lot of children . ) But the average upper middle class and the middle class do not . So we believe the birthrate in the developed areas will continue to drop and that the underdeveloped areas will follow this same trend when they become reasonably well developed . In Europe today , there is only about 1/2 percent population growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of a college education or of an extra room or of maid service . For many , maid service is the biggest issue of all three ( anyone who has taken care of three or four kids will know what I am talking about ) . Russian and Western birthrates also seem to be dropping and should approach European and Japanese levels reasonably soon . In many ways , this picture is likely to resemble certain aspects of Sweden today ? not in population tendency , but in style of life . If one stops at a small Swedish airport today , there are no porters ; he has to carry his own bags . If he is old or sick , the pilot will carry the bags for him . But one does not tip the pilot , because he generally earns more money than the passenger , by quite a bit . He 's carrying the bags as a courtesy . One of the characteristics of this rich society of the future is that personal services will get quite expensive . One can see this happening today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire a professional painter . They either paint their own houses or they try to get somebody , often an amateur , who is moonlighting . They ca n't afford professionals any more . In terms of historical perspective , if one tries to compare the average Continued on page 132 continued from page 131 standard of living of past cultures with current ones , one finds great difficulty in making the comparisons meaningful . However , one can persuasively argue that we know of no culture before the industrial revolution of the eighteenth century which attained much more than the reasonable equivalent today of $200 to $300 per capita for any lengthy period of time or dropped much below $50 per capita . So we can think of a range of $50 to $250 as more or less normal . That means that any culture that reaches much more than $300 in per capita income can be regarded as being richer than any society has been for any length of time-at least before the eighteenth century . By the end of this century , almost alrnost everybody outside of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups elsewhere , should have attained $300 per capita and therefore , by the judgment of past centuries , be richer than the richest societies ever known . In the next two decades or so , almost everybody should be over $300 per capita and by the mid-late twenty-first century , almost everybody should be over $1,000 per capita and hence , living at a relatively high level . Gaps , of course , would have increased during this entire period , but many of the moral issues raised by egalitarian value systems will presumably have lost some oftheir intensity , since there will , by historical standards , be almost no poor . Indeed , at this point most of the wealthy will have quit working hard to increase their income and/or the very concept of GNP per capita will have lost much of its traditional meaning . In view of these probabilities , why do so many people think we 're going to run out of time and resources ? The most well-known calculations have been sponsored by the Club of Rome . This is a group of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , organized by a man who lives in Rome , hence the name . They have united to study what they call " the current predicament of mankind . " Their first important study was by Professor Forrester of MIT , the second by Professor Meadows , also then at MIT . Both studies concluded that in the next fifty to 100 years we are going to run into a kind of rock wall . In some sense they believe that , with heroic and disciplined efforts , the earth can support about four billion people at about , say , $1,000 per capita . Professor Forrester 's basic argument on resources and pollution is the simplest . One does not need a computer to go through it . Forrester assumes there are 250 years of resources left in the world . Now if gross world product goes up by 5 percent a year , it doubles every fourteen years . Let us now assume , a bitpessimistically , that the use of resources goes at the same rate as gross world product . If this is so , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years of resources , because you 're using more at the end than at the beginning . So you have 230 years left . But now your rate is twice as fast , so in 1986 , fourteen years from now , you only have 115 years left at the 1986 rate . In the next fourteen years , or in the year 2000 , you use up twenty again , and you 're down to less than fifty-eight years . By 2014 there are only nineteen years left and in the next fourteen years you 've finished it . So if you tried to continue a 5-percent , or current , level of growth , you would run out in something less than fifty years . Then Forrester says , what if we 're off by a factor of 2 ? That only gives you fourteen years more . What if you 're off by a factor of 10 ? That only gives you another fifty years . That 's persuasive argument . It is very persuasive but it is wrong . There are a number of things wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses the wrong model of a resource . In this model , a resource is thought of as what we call a " fixed-bowl " model or a " fixed-pie " model . Imagine a bowl filled with a homogeneous substance and that using resources is like taking something out of the bowl . You can then calculate when the bowl will be empty by carefully measuring at the rate atwhich you take things out of it . much better picture of resource-also simplistic , but much better- is what we call the " use expanding " model , or the " growing pie . " Think of resource as being similar to a muscle or a skill . The more you use it the more you have . For example , if at any time in the last fifty years , you had put a sharp stop to the growth of the petroleum industry , my guess is that you would have run out within twenty or thirty years . The reason you did n't run out is that the very growth of the industry forced a technological and financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to drill wells , new ways of getting oil out of fields , the ocean , etc . If you had stopped that process by radical conservation ( and radical conservation would stop that process ) you simply run out sooner . We call that counterproductive behavior . Let us now consider the problem of feeding twenty billion people at a high standard of living . The most important element in feeding a large population is the supply of grain , either for direct use by the population or in supporting animals so that one can have a high quality of meat , poultry , milk and dairy foods . In poor countries four or five people can live for a year on a ton of grain . In rich countries you can support about one person per ton of grain because you feed so much grain to animals . ( You want meat and eggs and milk and vegetables and things like that . ) So if you have twenty billion people , you will need twenty billion tons of grain . Could you do it today ? Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three tons per hectare . Of course , one can now start practicing very intensive and advanced agriculture and double , triple , even quadruple this production . In fact , in tropical climates where one can get two or three crops a year , one might do another doubling or tripling . Under this kind of intensive cultivation , agricultural production might double or more , but we can clearly afford it . If I have $20,000 per capita as it stands , I can afford to spend $200 to $300 per person for grain , It is true that if people were not rich , doubling or tripling the cost of grain would put them into starvation . You could n't double or triple the cost of grain in China and/or India today . People would just starve to death ; there 's not enough money there . But you can if the world is rich . And this is one example of what we mean by " use expanding " resource . The biggest single resource you have is money GNP  --  did you know GNP is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not ; it 's gross national product and it makes you safe because you have resources you can reallocate . In fact , high GNP and technology are the most useful resources one can have . The best example is what we called the " use expanding " model of a resource . Only by economic growth and investment , and research and development can one get a high GNP and a high technology . That is , only by using the economy and technology can one both maintain and increase it . Another interesting example is energy . Under current circumstances we will run out of fossil fuels long before the end of the twenty-first century . The only likely long-term solutions seem to be the exploitation of nuclear and solar energy . Solar energy has lots of advantages , but it is presently quite expensive . Let us assume it will be used in the twenty-second century  --  possibly in the twenty-first , but let 's not depend on it . Let 's consider nuclear energy . The usual contention is that we will soon have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our uranium supplies . That 's probably true , but it may be wrong or there may be problems with these reactors ; so let us take another look at the uranium itself . At $10 a pound for uranium oxide , which is roughly the current price , we 'll run out in about fifty to sixty years . But raise the price to $100 , and we can afford to mine uranium even where it appears in a concentration of only sixty parts per million . That 's approximately what it is in many ordinary granites and ordinary shales . The supply at this price is , for all practical purposes , infinite . The price for electricity would go up only five mills per kilowatt hour  --  a 25 percent increase to the customer . Most people simply would n't notice it . In fact , it 's almost exactly equal to the increase we 're going to have anyway because of pollution control , but this would be in addition to that . This solution raises all kinds of pollution problems : release of radioactive materials into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste heat ; problems of safety and aesthetics . But all of these seem to me quite solvable . What kind of quality of life will this world of the future have ? I would assume a work year of about 1,000 hours  --  approximately half the current work year . Imagine this being a three-day week or a two-day week , forty weeks a year . What about population density ? There are roughly 150 million square kilometers of land in the world today . Ninety million of them are not really usable , so put that 60 percent aside for fun and recreation . Put aside about fifteen million for agriculture ( which seems to be more than we need ) and about fifteen million for industry , commerce and the like . That leaves about twenty million for human settlements  --  houses and parks , schools and all the infrastructure  --  and ten million for close-in commerce , government and other services . That is less than the density of Westchester County today-2,000 people per square mile , 800 people per square kilometer . It is about 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people think Westchester County is one of the nicest places in the United States to live and Holland one of the nicest countries . To see the United States populated that way , take the current metropolitan areas of the United States ( 300,000 square miles ) and populate it 2,000 people per square mile ( 600 million people , or three times the current population ) . Ninety percent of the United States would remain for industry , commerce , agriculture , and recreation . There would be a great deal of national park per person , beach per person , and so on . But unless you go very far from urban areas , you are going to meet somebody on the trail and I wo n't hike with you . What 's the problem ? It is something classicists might tell you about . I think it is very similar to the so-called failure of nerve in Hellenistic Greece . After Alexander died , there were , over the next two or three centuries , about a thousand philosophers in Athens . From that point on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why had their nerve failed ? ( This is a phrase used by Gilbert Murray in a great book called The Five Stages of Greek Religion . ) It failed because the Greek city-state had failed . Athens had failed . The ideals of this group had simply been destroyed . But at the time when they were crying doom and gloom and failure , Continued on page 134 // continued from page 133 the Macedonians and their other Greek friends were running the Mediterranean world . The seven wonders of the ancient world were built during that period  --  the period those philosophers described as total failure . This is , I think , quite typical . My own belief is that around the world today , the upper- and upper-middleclass elites are increasingly irritated at their problems and are projecting their failure as a class onto the outside world as a failure of nature , and/or a failure of society . Actually , this sense of failure  --  this loss of nerve  --  is not universal around the world but rather is held by a very small number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holland , parts of Belgium , England , the United States , and Canada . These are also the only places in the world where we have an upper-middle-class counterculture and the hippie phenomenon . If you add Switzerland to it , it is the only part of the world that ever had stable democracy in the last 300 years . It has lots of pluses and lots of minuses . The other areas of the world have not had the same kind of failure of nerve , or at least not to the same degree . 1 believe that in the United States we can project a picture of the world that is good enough for the average person and good enough for humanity to he able to say  --  with credibility and a good heart ? " That is a good picture ; let us preserve it . " And we do n't have to kill people to achieve it . We may have to hire some cops , but we can hire a cop with good conscience , since what we have is good for most people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . In fact , 1 believe you might organize a number of people worldwide to act as a lobby for the future and to act as an early warning system for problems that may come up to make this group members of a kind of a division or ideology . This group could then act very much like members of the Stoic religion of the Greeks and the Romans . The Stoics ran the Roman Empire for about 400 years and ran it very well . They were pacifistic , cosmopolitan , and antimilitaristic , but they ran an army . The thing tended to run in families in which the members of the family would say , " We do n't care how others act ; we do n't act that way . It is our job to keep the system running . " 1 believe a similar group could play a central role in both creating and maintaining useful and beneficial trends today . I suggest a very pretentious project  --  to recreate a modified and modern Stoicism around the world . Those Stoics still did a magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appropriateness of the Stoic tradition for the future is almost directly at odds with much literary discussion today which tends to emphasize one side of what they call Humanism . However , the current usage of the word " humanism " is rather misleading . ( The original word meant a return to Greco-Roman values as contrasted to those of the Catholic Church  --  a return to heroism and reason , Not to pleasure , not to joy , not to love , not to spontaneity , as in much modern American usage , but to reason and to heroism . Somewhat later , the Catholic Church synthesized its values with these Greco-Roman values . And then , humanism included religion and Catholic values . ) What I suggest is that we pledge ourselves to humanism  --  not in the way it is often used in America today but the way it was used in those centuries  --  a call for reason and for heroism . It is too good a word to lose . And this world is too good a place to be without faith in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
