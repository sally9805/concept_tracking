 | The Down-to-Earth Truth About Big Spending Our nation is confronted by a paradox . At no time in our history have we been so breathtakingly close to realizing the promise of America , yet so painfully far from marshaling all the resources that would fulfill that promise . We have retained the original freedoms of our Constitution and enlarged upon them , particularly with respect to civil rights . Our lives are longer and healthier : the average life expectancy has increased to 70 years ? a gain of 11 years since 1930 . We are becoming better educated : in the last decade the number of students enrolled in higher education has more than doubled , to 8.5 million . The proportion of those who are poor is declining : 12.5 percent of our people now live below the poverty line , compared to 21.9 percent ten years ago . " 4  | totals . We would need hundreds of billions of additional dollars . This is a rich country , but not that rich . Thus we must choose , painfully but necessarily , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal year , for example , the Administration proposed a number of new initiatives in education totaling $276 million . These included expanded help for black colleges and for " career education " ( the latter being an effort to make education at all levels more relevant to the real world of work ) . To make room for the boost , we proposed reductions of $177 million in aid to school districts containing large numbers of federal civilian employes . We also had to determine how much of the money available we could allocate to increase health services and educational opportunities in poor neighborhoods , to reduce the isolation of the aged , to offer alternatives to delinquency and drugs , and to support many other worthy claims . So it goes , down through the tiers of government ? the inescapable necessity of choosing . 2 . It takes more than just federal funds to eradicate our problems . The continual struggle for a piece of the federal fiscal pie conveys an impression that more money is the end-all answer . This is a dangerous illusion . The American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures : giant public-housing developments that have become high-rise slums and breeders of delinquency , drug addiction and Still , disappointments abound . A cloud of problems ? pollution , care of the aged , property taxes , drugs , big-city crime , and more ? seems to overshadow and darken our successes . We grow impatient and angry . I share these frustrations . But what especially troubles me is a chorus of voices promising quick , easy cures instead of providing straight talk about what we actually can and can not do over a period of time . In response , let me set out four realities that I have learned about our government and its powers . 1 . Not nearly enough money is available for everything we would like to do or believe worthwhile . Consider just a few widely accepted national goals : a " Right to Read " for every American ; day-care services for children of working parents ; a first-rate education for every disadvantaged child ; homemaker assistance for the elderly and bedridden who otherwise would have to be institutionalized ; vocational training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals in a reasonably adequate way , we would have to increase our federal spending by roughly $40 billion per year ? ten times our current expenditure for these purposes . If we listed other , larger claims ? money needed for health services , higher education , urban redevelopment , transportation , environmental protection , to name a few ? we would rapidly enter a realm of unimaginable budget  | crime ; scenery-destroying highways that bog down with traffic jams ; canal and harbor projects that ruin rivers and destroy marshlands ; and , worst of all , our disgraceful welfare system with its incentives for people not to work and for fathers to desert their families . Unfortunately , the temptation to solve problems by throwing cash at them is still firmly rooted in the rhetoric of many empire-building officials and office-seekers . Their persistent demands for more funds are accompanied by the implication that spending for domestic needs has been held at starvation levels . This is nonsense . Between 1965 and 1973 , federal civilian spending per person increased by more than 125 percent . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has skyrocketed from an annual rate of $30 billion to $1io billion . This year , for the first time in history , HEW 's budget ? $87 billion ? exceeds that of the Defense Department . If spending alone could solve the problems to which existing programs are addressed , there would today be no problems . 3 . The political process involves a shell game that raises expectations far beyond what can practically be achieved . Two misleading practices have developed over the years . First , Congress creates social programs requiring billions upon billions of dollars . Time after time , the figures on the price tag are higher than anything the Executive Branch can , in good conscience , request , and higher than anything that Congress itself is willing to provide . Historically , one set of committees in the House and Senate creates programs , and another entirely different set actually provides the money for them . The appropriations committees have al ways held the purse strings tighter than the authorizing committees . In recent years , the excesses of the committees that create programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those actually appropriated a serious concern . In 1964 , this gap for HEW was $200 million . Today it is nearly $9 billion . The **28;987;TOOLONG gap frequently causes the hopes of many citizens first to be raised , then to be dashed . For instance , in the last fiscal year , $1.1 billion was authorized for training grants , scholarships , fellowships and student loans for doctors , nurses and other health personnel . Less than half that sum was appropriated ? a shattering disappointment to scores of men and women in medicine , many of whom put the entire blame on the cutive Branch . It is time for people to understand that the promissory notes of an open-handed authorizing committee are not redeemable for full face value at the appropriations window . There are just too many competing claims . The second misleading practice in legislation involves passing new laws which convey authority that already exists ? with flourishes of press release : and self-congratulation . In  | the past three years , Congress has enacted nine such laws affecting HEW . clone . Each ardently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most often , the enactment misleads the public into believing that nothing has been done before and that something dramatic is about to happen . A striking example is the purportedly new authority to make grants for communicabledisease control . It so happens that this activity is among the oldest at HEW . The fault of these particular pieces of legislation is that they are illusory . They make people think that something fresh and significant is at hand , when , in fact , all that we can do about the given problems ? even though inadequate ? is already being done . 4 . The governmental apparatus itself is often choked with red tape and more concerned with its own prerogatives than with helping people . Frequently , on visits to communities around the country , I run into dedicated people who have been driven to despair trying to penetrate the multi-layered , overlapping , unresponsive network of federal agencies . The mayor of one midwestern city is told he can obtain federal funds to set up a plan for comprehensive health service , yet he finds that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five other grants , each from a different federal program , require separate governing boards , making efficient coordination virtually impossible . An official in another city finds numerous grants for libraries ? but can not get money to hire teachers . Programs are designed to build parks ? but no allowance is made for essential maintenance costs , which will become a burden on the community . At HEW , we have devoted priority attention to simplifying the administrative process . Several years ago , for example , to secure funds for health and child care , Tennessee submitted a plan 790 pages long , a budget of 35 pages and 94 more pages of expenditure reports . Today it need submit only three pages to satisfy our requirements . And , through a coordination office , we are trying to initiate a simplified grant-packaging system for any community participating in more than one HEW program . Yet , no matter how many timesavers we devise , narrow-approach programs remain a major obstacle to the prudent use of tax dollars . Congress continues to launch crash legislation , then pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers soon develop their own client groups eager to lobby for perpetuating the programs , and so we confront yet another set of roadblocks in the way of broad solutions . We call this " hardening of the categories . " IN two and one-half years at the helm of our nation 's largest domestic department I have come up against these four realities again and again . I can not offer any magic answers ,  | but I do recommend that we bear in mind the following points : First , beware those who propose legislative panaceas or proffer false gifts from Washington . No money trees grow in the nation 's capital . Rather , the funds come from the hard-earned dollars of U.S. taxpayers . We can not conceivably meet all claims comprehensively and concurrently without levying such excessive taxes as would jeopardize economic growth and employment . Congress should set up its own oversight agency to keep total fiscal commitments in view and to analyze the real costs of each new proposal . Perhaps we also should silence the siren song of specific dollar authorizations in legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be necessary . " It would be more honest and far less likely to raise false hopes across the land . Second , government must exert every conceivable effort to discard those programs which are truly not working , however ferociously vested interests may battle to continue them . Third , the bureaucracies at all levels ? federal , state and local ? must wrench their attention away from the mere tending of government machinery and turn it outward to people and to the neighborhoods and communities where people live . facilitate putting the emphasis on people rather than on paper , we should combine many existing grant programs into comprehensive block grants . This is the aim of our revenue-sharing proposal in education , which would consolidate 33 categorical programs . We have also submitted legislation to overcome fragmentation of grant-supported human services in states and localities . It would , for example , permit transfer of funds among HEW programs , and deserves early enactment . Finally , and most importantly , we must not kid ourselves or let others kid us into believing we can have our every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is fashionable to talk about " reordering our priorities . " This we are already doing , but nevertheless we must still face the agonizing task of deciding exactly where our actual revenue resources should be placed . For that is the real responsibility of good government ? making balanced , realistic and humane choices . @#
