Family-owned businesses can be showcases of executive harmony-or the arena for bitter feuds made all the more painful by the fact that the disputants are of the same blood . For the past 30 years one of the most spectacular such feuds has pitted Robert Mondavi , now 64 , against his brother Peter , 63 , over the operation of the Charles Krug Winery , the oldest in California 's Napa Valley . Their struggle came to a climax this year in a court battle interrupted by their mother 's death . Now it is nearing a surprising conclusion : a California judge has ordered the profitable winery-it earned $3.5 million on sales of $16 million in the fiscal year that ended last week-to be sold , taking it out of the family 's control altogether . <P> The saga began in 1922 , when Italian Immigrants Cesare and Rose Mondavi settled in Lodi , Calif. , to start a grape-shipping business . In 1943 , drawing on savings and bank loans , the Mondavis acquired the Charles Krug Winery , a dilapidated structure dating to 1861 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership , C. Mondavi &; Sons , and later turned it into a corporation . Cesare , Rose , Robert and Peter each took 20% ; Daughters Helen and Mary received 10% each . Cesare put Robert in charge and returned to grape shipping . When Peter got out of the Army Air Corps at the end of World War II , he became production manager . <P> The two brothers clashed almost from the start . Says Peter : " I 'm conservative . Bob is an extravert , a promoter . " Robert adds : " Peter 's business philosophy and mine are completely opposite . " <P> Cesare usually managed to arbitrate their business disputes , but after he died in 1959 the tensions increased until , in 1965 , they exploded into a fistfight . The other family members talked Robert into taking a six-month leave to cool off . He soon concluded they wanted him out and started a rival business , the Robert Mondavi Winery-while still sharing the family 's profits from Krug . In a final burst of fraternal affection , Peter helped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new winery and lending it a badly needed bottling machine . <P> The dtente did not last ; the other Mondavis soon asked Robert to stop using the family name as a label ( he refused ) . Meanwhile , Krug prospered under Peter 's direction , but an involved tax situation held down the family 's share of its earnings . In 1972 , for instance , Krug earned $1.9 million pretax , but the family partnership netted only $332,525 of that . Peter proposed forming a new partnership that would ease the tax bite-and , not incidentally , reduce Robert 's share to 10% . Robert refused to join , so the other Mondavis went ahead without him . Robert promptly sued , contending that his brother , with support from his mother and sisters , was scheming to cut him off from his share of the family 's profits from Krug . <P> Complete Victory . The trial finally began last spring . Two months into the trial , Rose Mondavi died . Robert and Peter stood close together at her funeral but spoke not a word to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert a complete victory . He found that the old partnership , C. Mondavi &; Sons , is " no longer the family corporation originally envisioned " and ordered the assets of the Krug Winery sold .
