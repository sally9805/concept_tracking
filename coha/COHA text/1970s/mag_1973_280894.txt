For a glimpse inside a family under pressure , TIME Correspondent Bonnie Angela talked last week to irrepressible Julie Nixon Eisenhower about life in the White House during a week of crisis : <P> <P> Julie is incensed at the idea that her father is a desperate man , harassed by the worst of all his crises . " I think sometimes he really likes a challenge , " she says . " It 's kind of a gauntlet thrown down-you 've got to pick it up . " That , asserts Julie , is exactly what the President has done . She says that her father has never discussed the possibility of impeachment with his family . On the contrary , she reports , the President is the family 's strongest member these days . " He 's the one who 's always calling us and saying , ' Now do n't read the papers tomorrow because it 's going to be bad . This whole week is going to be bad , and I do n't want you to worry about it . I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " She simply laughs off AFL-CIO President George Meany 's charge that the President is suffering " dangerous emotional instability . " Says she : " It 's so absurd . " <P> How did Nixon feel about his reversal on the Watergate tapes ? " Disappointment , " says Julie . " He was standing with a constitutional principle , and he wanted to preserve this for future Presidents but he thought it had reached the point where there was no public understanding for his position . " <P> Busy Weekend . Of life in the White House during the tumultuous weekend that brought the firing of Archibald Cox , the resignation of Elliot Richardson and the dismissal of William Ruckelshaus , Julie understates : " Well , it was a busy weekend for my dad . But in the evening we did relax , and Friday night turned out to be a kind of party . " Julie and David had invited another young couple , Mr. and Mrs. Robert Milligan ( he works in the Commerce Department ) , to the White House . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our voices , they came hurrying down and asked us to have dinner with them . " Joined by Nixon Friend Bebe Rebozo , the young people dined with the Nixons , discussed the day 's events and then put matters aside to watch the latest Paul Newman movie ( The Sting ) . Most tantalizing of all the weekend 's events is the picture Julie draws of the President on Saturday evening summoning the family to explain why Cox had been fired , an explanation Julie adroitly declined to pass along . " When he writes his memoirs , he will explain . " <P> Sunday saw a visit by Rebozo and the Nixons to Julie and David 's home in Bethesda , Md . " It 's the best deal in the world , " chuckles Julie . " My parents bring dinner . And they always bring so much-this time it was a Mexican dinner-that I freeze the other half . "
