Even after the oil workers and Teamsters settle their contracts , an extraordinary number of big pacts , covering a wide variety of workers , will be up for renegotiation next year . A rundown of the most important : <P> Rubber . Contracts between 70,000 members of the United Rubber , Cork , Linoleum and Plastic Workers of America and the four major tire companies-Firestone , BF Goodrich , Goodyear and Uniroyal-expire in April . The militant union has conducted eight major strikes since 1960 ; the last , in 1976 , dragged on for 141 days . Another next year is likely . Still , the union 's demands focus on job security rather than wages , and the cost of the settlement could be partly offset by changes in work rules . <P> Public employees .

Most of the unions , again sensitive about imports , are expected to concentrate on job security , and if moderate wage settlements are reached in other industries , the electrical workers will probably follow suit . <P> Autos . The really big one . In September , contracts between the 650,000 members of the United Auto Workers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades , the union has struck one or another of the companies each time around ; early speculation is that this year its prime target will be GM . Main demands will be for inflation protection and a shorter work week , but the liberal union 's stance could harden if Carter moves to cut social spending .
