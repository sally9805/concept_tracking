Dwight Dobbs , 41 , owner of an office supply company in Urbana , Ill. , got so tired of Watergate and what he considered disrespect toward the President by the news media that he rented three billboards that read : " I have more faith in this man . . . than I have in any of his accusers . . . especially the press . " Dobbs was rewarded with the thrill of his life . <P> The phone rang , a male voice announced , " This is the White House switchboard , " and told him to hold on for the President . Then that most familiar of voices came on and chatted with Dobbs for fifteen minutes . <P> The euphoric Dobbs was the lion of Urbana for two days . Then the bottom dropped out . The Associated Press telephoned him to say that it had checked with the White House and found that Nixon had made no such call . Dobbs , who maintains that every inflection of the famous voice was perfectly clear , called Deputy Press Secretary Gerald Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President had not called , but added that Nixon did indeed thank him for his support . Further consolation came last week in the form of personal letters from both Richard and Pat . But the phantom mimic is still at large .
