In an extraordinary campaign , the Soviet Union for weeks has been attacking Israel and Zionism with newspaper articles , resolutions , petitions and mass meetings . Despite a tradition of Russian anti-Semitism dating from the days of the czars , Moscow insists that the drive is not directed at the country 's loyal Jews but only at the Zionists - those who believe in a separate homeland in Palestine for all Jews . The cunning thing about the campaign is that Moscow has pressured Russia 's Jews into conducting it themselves . A few Jews , however , have refused to go along with the official line . Last week they were circulating audacious letters challenging the government campaign . <P> One Homeland . The anti-Zionist drive follows some characteristic Soviet patterns . There was a letter to Tass from a Jewish doctor in Uzbekistan : " We have never had and never will have anything in common with Zionists . We have only one homeland : the Soviet Union . " Meetings of Jews were held in factories and on farms to proclaim their satisfaction with life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zionists as evil men " who every day sow death and destruction on the occupied Arab lands . " <P> Two weeks ago the campaign reached an unusual pitch in Moscow . At a government-sponsored press conference in Friendship House , a panel of prominent Jews appeared before foreign newsmen to explain an anti-Zionist statement that had been signed by 52 of them , including Bolshoi Prima Ballerina Maya Plisetskaya . Their statement declared that Zionism " expressed the chauvinist views and racist ravings of the Jewish bourgeoisie . " <P> A reply to the government campaign was not long in coming . One group of 39 Jews , in a signed petition that was made available to Western correspondents in Moscow , declared : " We are of those Jews who persistently express the desire to leave for Israel and unfailingly are refused by the Soviet organs . We believe that Jews will answer the anti-Israeli campaign by fortifying their pride in their people and by declaring : ' Next year in Jerusalem ! ' " Izvestia denounced the petitioners as " renegades who have long been known for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted in an open letter to the 52 : " Unlike you , we are not Jews only because this detail is noted on our identification cards . We deeply treasure the indissoluble ties that bind us to Jews of all countries . " <P> Incident in Georgia . Moscow is sensitive toward charges that Russian Jews are discriminated against and are not allowed to emigrate . One estimate aired by the protesting Jews last week was that in the past year 240,000 of Russia 's 3,000,000 Jews have requested permission to leave , but have been turned down . An incident last year involving 18 Jewish families in Georgia contributed to the current uproar . The families claim that they were told they could join their relatives in Israel . They quit their jobs , sold their possessions and waited for documents that never came . In desperation , the group finally wrote to Israel 's Premier Golda Meir , pointing out that their appeals to Russian officials had " disappeared like teardrops in desert sands . " Mrs. Meir , who is Russian-born , forwarded their " sincere and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human Rights Commission .
