The whims of weather have always bedeviled India 's food production . This year the drought that appears every five years with devastating regularity has struck again , sweeping across India from the Bay of Bengal to the Arabian Sea and north to the foothills of the Himalayas . Across the vast Deccan Plateau , where 50 million people live , crops are stunted , cattle emaciated , and people weak and exhausted from hunger . Thanks to astute stockpiling by the government-and to the Green Revolution that has helped to double food production in the past decade-India for the first time in centuries has enough food stocks to ward off mass starvation . But having ample food on hand is only half the battle . There is also the mammoth task of distributing supplies to the needy in remote rural villages-a project in which New Delhi has been less successful . The drought , moreover , has brought in its train a host of other problems . Small businesses have been wiped out . Drinking water is so scarce that it has to be hauled in by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities in search of work . Malnutrition is pervasive . To assay some of the effects of the drought , TIME 'S New Delhi Bureau Chief William Stewart last week visited the hard-hit state of Maharashtra and its capital , Bombay , and filed this report : <P> From the swank high-rise apartments of Malabar Hill to the new skyscrapers at Narriman Point , Bombay exudes money , power and privilege . But the city 's back streets tell another story . They have become home to thousands of people seeking refuge from the scorching sun , who have poured into the city looking for work . They sleep on the platforms of railroad stations or in the jhuggis-sheet-metal and jute huts-that are home to hundreds of thousands of Bombay 's poor . There is little work to be found , and in the past few months , with no money and often no shelter , many have had to beg . Accustomed to providing for themselves , they are humiliated and bitter that the government has not done anything to alleviate their plight . Since most of them have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fair price shops " - so called because they sell below the regular market price-set up by New Delhi to distribute food stocks . <P> One of the refugees is Narayan Mahadev Thanage , 30 , who lives with his wife and daughter in one of the jhuggis adjacent to the new Bombay slaughterhouse . He was forced to leave his five-acre farm in Ahmednagar District 125 miles from Bombay , one of the areas worst affected by the drought . In a good year , he cleared 3,000 rupees ( $410 ) over and above the cost of supporting his family . " In my village there are n't enough people left to make a good funeral , " he says . " Maybe there are 100 , and they are mostly old . The schools and factories are closed . There are relief projects , but in some areas they have stopped because there is n't even enough drinking water . You might get work once every 15 days . " Thanage gave his four bullocks , two buffaloes , two cows and a few goats to the Belapur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fodder , and came to Bombay . " Everybody here is hungry , " he adds . " Any man with self-respect would not I beg , but if it 's a question of filling your stomach and there is no work , what is I a man to do ? "
