txt Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba got his first look at a Boeing 747 jumbo jet plane early this morning after Pan American World Airways Flight 299 from New York to San Juan was hijacked to Havana with 379 people aboard . Capt . Augustus Watkins , the pilot , said the plane was hijacked by a young bearded man at 2:47 A.M. , less than two hours after the plane had taken off from Kennedy Airport at 1:07 A.M. When the plane landed at Jose Marti Airport outside Havana at 5:31 A.M. , Premier Castro was on hand to take a look at the largest American commercial jet now in use and probably the largest plane ever to land in Cuba . The hijacking was the first of a 747 . " The only people to get off the plane were me and the hijacker , " Captain Watkins said . ) " I met Fidel and took him for a tour of the outside of the airplane . He asked all manner of questions related to the plane 's capacity and speed . He was particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from the Cuban airfield . I told him that was not a problem . " The 53-year-old pilot related the events connected with the hijacking after the plane arrived in San Juan later this morning . Captain Watkins said Mr. Castro had spent about 30 or 40 minutes inspecting the aircraft and then helped to get the plane away in the unusually short time of 52 minutes . " The hijacker wanted to get his luggage off the plane before we took off , and I had to // explain to him and to Castro that this could not be done on ' the 747 without special baggage - handling equipment . which was not available in Havana , " the pilot said . " After I promised to see to it that the luggage was shipped to Havana on another flight , Castro gave orders to clear us for take-off , " Captain Watkins added . The pilot and Mr. Castro talked through an interpreter . Before leaving Havana , Captain Watkins said , he invited the Cuban Premier to board the plane to see how it looked from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Premier Castro said , declining the invitation . The plane took off at 6:23 A.M. for Miami , where it landed at 7:10 to refuel . An airline official said two agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation boarded the plane and during the flight to San Juan questioned the crew and passengers who had contact with the hijacker . After the plane landed in San Juan at 10:45 A.M. , 6 hours 40 minutes behind schedule , about 20 F.B.I . men climbed aboard to question the passengers and crewmen further . The hijacker , who has been tentatively identified as R. Campos , was sitting in the firstclass section of the aircraft and first approached a stewardess , Esther de la Fuente . He Pulled Out a Gun ' " He pulled out a gun , pointed it at me and said , " fake me to the pilot because I want to go to Cuba ' , " Miss de la Fuente said . " I thought he was joking and replied , " No , let 's go to Rio , it 's a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then he pulled out a bottle , which he said contained explosives , and warned me that he was not kidding , " she continued . " I took him to the captain . " The hijacker also demanded that another stewardess , Regina de Silva , accompany him upstairs to the cockpit. the plane is so large that few of the passengers would have realized what was going on in the first-class compartment even if they had been awake . But with most of the passengers asleep , fewer than a half dozen were aware of anything unusual . There was no panic at any time , airline officials said . One of those aware of what was going on was Miss Rosa Troche , a Dominican national who was sitting next to the hijacker , She said : " I never knew what was going on until I saw him point a gun at the stewardess . Then I knew we were on our way to Havana . Hijacker Speaks Spanish Miss de la Fuente , an Argentine , said the hijacker , who spoke Spanish , appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent , although he spoke frequently about Cuba and the airport at Havana as though he had been there before . Airline officials said he was tentatively identified as R. Campos because that was the name listed for the only passenger not accounted for as the flight ended in San Juan . Captain Watkins said that when he first saw the gunman , whom he described as a young man " with a black beret and a short beard who looked like a pint-sized " Che Guevara , " he attempted to talk him out of the hijacking . " Then he appeared to be a little kooky , " the pilot said , " and I decided that , the safer thing to do was to follow his instructions . So we went to Havana . " The pilot said landing and ' taking off at Havana did not prove to be difficult for the big jet . The only problem , he said , was that the unloading ramp at the airport was about three feet too short . The plane carried 360 passengers , including 11 infants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eight-month stint as Pan American 's chief training pilot on the 747 jets . A native of Augusta , Ga. , he and his wife have homes in Oyster Bay , L.I. , in Tazewell , Va. , and in the El Yunque forest in Puerto Rico . Mrs. Watkins was a passenger on the hijacked plane , their son said , because the couple had planned to spend some time at their Puerto Rican home .
