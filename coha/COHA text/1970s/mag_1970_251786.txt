Texas has often been funny . Mexicans have sometimes been good for a laugh . National Guard soldiers can usually provide a chuckle or two . So can militant right-wingers , harassed sheriffs and discombobulated diplomats . Even the Alamo could be funny . But Viva Max , which is about all these things , manages to be funny about none of them . <P> Not , of course , for lack of trying . A ragtag unit of the Mexican army , led by General Maximilian Rodrigues de Santos ( Peter Ustinov ) and Sergeant Valdez ( John Astin ) , straggle across the U.S.-Mexican border , looking simultaneously tired and suspicious . General Max and a sadsack adjutant hijack a car full of gringo tourists and scout the territory . They return to the troops , and in a matter of seconds there is an irregular unit of the Mexican army charging through today 's downtown San Antonio on its way to reclaim the Alamo . <P> Director Jerry Paris manages to ignore whatever humor there is in this situation . Ustinov is merely gross in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the supporting players-including Pamela Tiffin and Keenan Wynn-wince along with them . Jonathan Winters , as General Billy Joe Hallson , secondhand mattress salesman and head of the San Antonio unit of the Texas National Guard , has a couple of good stumblebum comic moments , as does Kenneth Mars playing a Texas Minuteman . But even they can do nothing about the witless dialogue and vapid plotting , which lace the comic moments in Viva Max with all the kick of day-old cerveza.
