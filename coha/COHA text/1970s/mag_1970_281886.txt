In the first such action anywhere , a state has hauled the Federal Government into court for polluting water . California last week sued the commanding general of Fort Ord for dumping undisinfected sewage into Monterey Bay . The suit , filed in the state superior court , asks civil penalties of $6,000 for every day since Jan. 1 for ignoring a cease-and-desist order that was issued against Fort Ord by a water-quality-control board . If the court agrees that the base continued to pollute the bay , the Army would face a fine of nearly $500,000 . <P> Although President Nixon ordered all federal facilities to end pollution-or to have antipollution programs under way-by 1972 , California was not about to wait for Fort Ord to police itself . Instead , it brought suit under a new state law that gives the state attorney general power to act directly against all water polluters . " The law is very clear and constitutional . The Army is in violation of it , " says Chief Deputy Attorney General Charles A. O'Brien . " We are now going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of California . If we succeed , we will set a model for the country . "
