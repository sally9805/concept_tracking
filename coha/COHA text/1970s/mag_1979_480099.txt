AT THE Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles , a group called " Californians for Brown " was paying $750 a head to dine in the governor 's company . When Jerry Brown was introduced not as a candidate for President , not even as the next President , but simply as " the President of the United States , " he smiled ; but unlike everyone else in the room , he did not laugh . To a thousand of the richest and most powerful people in California ? which is to say , on the planet he spoke of seeing the visions of William Blake realized in the photographs sent back from Jupiter . My dinner companions included the treasurer of a large munitions corporation and the director of a government agency with 15,000 employees . The governor counseled us to despoil the atmosphere less and to value austerity in our personal lives more . He spoke of brown-skinned migrants fusing new cultures in Los Angeles and of technologists building cathedrals in the sky . Some might call his approach " flaky " or " weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in him and in California this does not amount to decadence , but instead bespeaks " the seeds of future greatness . " Do outsiders make fun of California ? Do skeptics deride Brown as an opportunist ? " That 's the price , " Jerry Brown told the diners , " that California pays for being the place the rest of the country would like to be , and will be in the future . " His gesture encompassed the Century Plaza Hotel : here , he said , is the place where one sees " the meeting of the outer with the inner universe . " It is this , he concluded , that " makes our state the beacon of all the people on the planet . " The address , which had begun to thunderous applause , concluded in a hush . Then the room went black . I had assumed that Jerry Brown would be the evening 's main event , but he was only the warm-up . The Californians for Brown were cheering . On stage was the child actress who plays the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond curly wig she wore had been contrived to match his fur . And if there was some humorous , self-deprecating irony in all this ? in the orphan adopted by Daddy Warbucks as the pike de resistance of a $750. a-plate dinner for Jerry Brown , amateur of Zen and prophet of the new era of limits ? it seemed unintended . " Tomorrow , " the child sang , " tomorrow . " Money and power are the great stratifiers in Southern California , but parking problems and traffic jams are the great democratizers . Political ladies in diamonds and waiters from Watts know only so many cars can be disgorged from an under . ground garage in so many minutes : they grow frank and philosophical as they wait at the curb . " Loved the dog , " a woman confided , hugging her furs about her , to no one in particular . " Once they made a dog just like that emperor of Rome , " offered the busboy who had cleared away her filet mignon . And further down one could sec Pat Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conversation with Lew Wasserman , the most successful backer in California politics , thus arguably one of the most powerful men in the world . " I think this gentleman from the press needs a few words from you , " Jerry Brown 's father told Wasserman , and after a moment the chairman of the Music Corporation of America drew me aside . " We held this dinner to pay off a few of Jerry 's debts from the last gubernatorial campaign , " Wasserman said , not caring who heard . " I 'll be for Carter in ' 80 . " I mentioned the fusion of new cultures , Blakeian visions , and Jovian clouds . Could he envision himself , under any circumstances , favoring Jerry Brown for the White House ? " I ca n't imagine it . " Wasserman replied . " Never . " And he stepped into his car , which merged into a tumult of Audis , Mercedes , Sevilles . The cars at first clung together . Then they dispersed , and in every direction they sped , the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeway . 1 SPENT two and a half months in California , much of it trying to divine the conundrum of Jerry Brown , listening to people who had known him since his youth , like Elizabeth Gatov , formerly the Treasurer of the United States , June Degnen , a member of the Democratic National Committee , and Don Bradley , who helped run Pat Brown 's campaigns . There were politicians who grappled with Brown , like Leo McCarthy , Howard Berman , and Maxine Waters , the Democratic leaders of the state assembly ; and those Brown , as governor , had entrusted with power , like Rose Bird , the chief justice , Gray Davis , his chief of staff , and Robert Gnaizda , formerly a close aide who now practices public-advocacy law . There were those who have denounced Brown in print , like his former employment director , J. D. Lorenz , and those who were surprisingly unvindictive in private , like Jesse Unruh , who is now state treasurer . I listened to those who analyzed Brown 's policies , like Jonathan Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his politics , like Mervin Field , the opinion analyst . I talked to taxi drivers , bartenders , and people on buses ; those who lived lavishly in Beverly Hills , and with fewer amenities in San Quentin prison ; waiters who had served Jerry Brown dinner , women who had had dates% ith him , voters who had shaken his hand . Whether people detested Brown or attended gala dinners in his honor , whether they knew him personally or had seen him only on television , the Californians with whom I spoke generally reacted as Wasserman had when I asked about Jerry Brown and the Presidency . A person who had known Brown much of his life , and said he liked him , smiled and answered : " The Presidency ? I would do what I could to stop him . " One of Brown 's acquaintances from the Zen Center in San Francisco suggested he had no karma . Cesar Chavez , when I met him , refused to say anything at all ? and then a few weeks later de-flounced Brown publicly . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor repeatedly call him " dangerous . " One of California 's most distinguished jurists was of the opinion that the Bill of Rights would not be safe in his hands , and a veteran of many a dinner-table seminar with the governor said : " He wo n't blow up the world to spite the Russians . Jerry will do it because it seems like an intriguing idea at the time . A capacity to be intrigued by ideas , " he added , " must never be mistaken for a capacity to be committed to principles . " In truth , I encountered deep enthusiasm for Brown only twice , both times expressed by proprietors of restaurants that the governor had made famous by his patronage . His aides were loyal , but not even all of them had much enthusiasm for arguing that it was in the nation 's best interests that Brown move into the White House . I must say that Brown did not excite hatred either . These conversations were completely different in tone from discussions about Nixon during Watergate , or about Lyndon Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmos arid proposes a balanced budget here on earth ; professes austerity and takes vacations in Africa ; warns the disadvantaged to expect less of government in a new era of limits , and hungers to achieve the highest , most powerful political office on earth . And Californians respond to these contradictions not with anger but with indifference . One member of his cabinet described the governor as " the hole in the doughnut . You ca n't put your finger on him , but he is always there . " When I discussed tax reform with Jonathan Lewis , he said : " Most politicians get elected by being all things to all people . Jerry survives by being nothing to everyone . " Advocates of equal education , of efforts to fight structural unemployment and to rationalize the state 's finances , all gave similar accounts : they no longer pay attention to what Brown says , because it bears so little relationship to what he does . For years Brown has lectured the state on the need to use energy less and to reduce pollution . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established a car-pool lane on the Santa Monica Freeway , Brown quickly ordered it eliminated . The governor and the people of California have struck a deal : He can be the prophet of the new epoch of the 1980s , so Iong as he leaves them alone . Midway through my visit , The California Poll , an independent , nonpartisan institute supported by California publications and universities , published some interesting surveys . Only 21 percent of California Democrats said they would vote for Brown for President if he ran in his own home-state primary . Only 18 percent supported President Carter . On his trips East , Governor Brown had suggested that the causes he espoused were surging out of the West to determine the national future in the 1980s , that liberal politicians who clung to the notion that big government could solve big problems were destined to be swept away . But the same poll showed Sen. Edward Kennedy ? in spite of his liberalism , his opposition to the tax revolt , his total rejection of a constitutional convention ; in spite of his Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? beating Brown by more than two to one in California itself . In a three-way contest Kennedy was the Presidential favorite of more California Democrats-53 percent ? than Brown and Carter combined . In a direct Brown-Kennedy contest , the poll indicated , Kennedy would defeat the governor of California in a California Presidential primary by a margin almost as big as he habitually wins in Massachusetts , 62 percent to 31 percent . A companion poll indicated that Brown 's constitutional convention was opposed 40 percent to 36 percent , with 24 percent undecided . By far the most revealing result came when Jerry Brown confronted Jimmy Carter head on in a California Presidential primary . It was almost a dead heat : 46 percent for Brown , after so much exposure here of his character and policies ; 43 percent for Carter : 11 percent with " 110 preference " if the choice came down to that . Why did Brown 's Presidential ambitions arouse so little enthusiasm in California ? Another survey by The California Poll revealed that 45 percent of all Californians believe Brown " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 46 percent art convinced both that " Jerry Brown is n't providing public leadership of the kind needed to get things done " and that he " does not work well with the legisla ture in getting necessary laws and pro grams passed . " The poll discover &; " that two-thirds of the public do not countenance an active drive for the Presidency by Brown . " 1 T TAKES LESS TIME for a lobbyist , politician , or journalist to fly from Los Angeles to the state capitol at Sacramento than an East Los Angeles housemaid needs to travel by bus to Palos Verdes or Beverly Hills . Five years after Governor Brown first announced that Californians must conserve more and expect less and look inward to their souls , not outward to increased consumption , to fulfill themselves , the state still works superbly for the advantage of those who spend lavishly today , and leave balancing their books for tomorrow . The lesson California has to teach the nation , Brown suggested when we spoke , is that prosperity can not be built on debt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite lesson . With Brown as governor , California has run up the biggest foreign balance-of-trade deficit of any state in the Union . It was less than $L3 million when he took office in 1975 . After four years of Brown 's lectures on limits , it amounted to no less than $6.6 billion last year . Yet this tidal wave of red ink was far less important than the fact that , over the same period , California 's total foreign trade had soared from about $22 billion a year to more than $36A billion . With the state emerging as a major trading partner of the vast Pacific rim , California 's cities are full of new skyscrapers . its factories full of new jobs . Wealthy Japanese crowd restaurants in San Francisco ; Chinese investors have discovered Oakland . Healthy , well-dressed , affluent people are driving cars , riding airplanes , and using their credit cards to rent speedboats at Marina del Rey . The only principled Californians , in the terms of Brown 's theology , are those obliged by circumstance to practice what Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or black youths with vacant eyes , or Chicano women wearing lunch-counter uniforms ? those other Californians who spend only what they have , and consume only what they can afford , and who must wait forever in the sunshine at bus stops while the rest of the state speeds by . " The important thing about a balanced budget , " Brown told me when we met in his vast air-conditioned office in the capitol , " is that if people do n't really want programs they wo n't get them . " I inquired about California 's closed schools , its demoralized community colleges , its growing illiteracy , its unemployed minority youth . " Does spending all that money on schools really help ? " Brown wondered , and handed me an article by Milton Friedman on the chimera of public education . What about the lost , the crazed , the drug addicts , those human casualties with which every society must cope ? The governor gave me the transcript of his discussion with Dr. Thomas Szasz on " the myth of mental illness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon 's " law and order " and Carter 's " ethnic purity " ? really just code words ? Under the guise of a new politics , new era , and new decade , was n't Jerry Brown just pandering to selfishness , trying to exploit the " Me Generation " the way others had the " silent majority " ? I was counseled by Bill Press , Brown 's chief urban planner , to study a book the governor had urged all his closest advisers to read . It revealed , 1 was told , the perils of too much social , economic , and human presumption . It was called The Faustian Delusion . F OR THE NEXT FORTNIGHT or so , I tried to keep track of Jerry Brown 's displacements . He flew to the East Coast and back three times , for a total of about 18,000 miles , to warn against the politics of waste . One Sunday he flew to New Mexico for the day . He visited his country home at San Juan Ridge in Northern California , and flew countless times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district of Los Angeles . He attended political meetings in San Mateo County , San Diego , the Central Valley , and a dozen other places in California , and then he left on a 22,000-mile , ten-day vacation to New York , Liberia , Nigeria , Kenya , Tanzania , and Europe with several close friends , including the singer Linda Ronstadt . Others might not recognize that the attempt to teach a ghetto teenager to read is Faustian presumption . or realize that the mind-blurred , elderly , homeless drunks shambling past the governor 's office in Sacramento each night are illusions , but as I commuted among San Francisco , Los Angeles , and Sacramento , mimicking the governor 's own perpetual motions in a small way , it was easy to understand Brown 's reasoning . While others are blinded by getting too close to things , it is his destiny to perceive the verities of the future from the windows of airplanes . Gazing down from such heights , traveling ceaselessly at such speeds , does he not best perceive people and their problems as ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than accomplishments. understand California , America , the cosmos ? life itself ? as metaphor ? Sacramento is like all artificial , asymmetrically located capitals ; it is Brasilia without modern architecture , Washington without blacks , Canberra . Sacramento is an Aleph ? that is , not a place where power converges , but the point where images do . From Friday afternoon to Monday morning the capitol and the nearby mall are as empty as Wall Street on a bank holiday . But on Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday Sacramento is where the most important people of Los Angeles , San Francisco , Orange County , San Diego , the Valley , of the whole state converge with PSA flight schedules in their pockets . In elevators and hotel suites , in antechambers and on television , over steaks at Frank Fats and drinks at the Ponderosa Hotel , they bicker , orate , cope with scheduling conflicts , maneuver , and deal . Then they fly away , back to the realities that have sent them here . The only real deadline in the seat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as I watcher Sacramento empty out one evening , i occurred to me that if one constantly looked down on California as a kalei doscope , perceived politics as meta phor , and interpreted government as linguistic game , then one could appre elate that Jerry Brown , in terms of Cali fornia , is not the inner-directed lone some describe him as , but a one-ma : coalition . Like Tammany Hall or th Cook County organization , he is understood not for what he is but fo what he combines ; not as a politic , means , but as an end unto himself . Oh style political machines were built u people , ballot boxes , and money . Brow is a coalition of California resonance He has the intellectual instincts of a Marin County ecotopian , yet he shares the Orange County developer 's loathing of government " waste " ? that is , programs that subsidize people rather than profit . He hates pollution in Humboldt County and loves Linda Ronstadt in the entertainment capital of the world . He combines Earl Warren 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitching himself to a cause , Ronald Reagan 's photogeneily , and his own father 's finesse for the political deal . When we spoke privately , for example , he seemed to sense my own II interests , and argued strongly for a common market linking America , Canada , and Mexico . But a few days later , in South San Francisco , he was among people whose whole lives seemed threatened by Mexican workers , Japanese imports , Arab oil . Foreigners , he told them , had to be stopped from taking away American factories and jobs , from buying up American land . If many Californians express apathy or contempt for the governor , they have also consented to elect him . They do so because Brown is entirely representative of the state he governs . Affluent California , and much of the rest of America in the 1970s , is populated by enlightened eighteenth-century aristocrats who want the Rights of Man , and to keep their estates , too , In such societies , the politician is expected to create an impression of enlightened progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , I had a long discussion with a solar-energy activist . He emphasized the perils of the nuclear reactor , the folly of dependence on imported oil . By chance I asked his position on the carpool lane on the Santa Monica Freeway . He denounced it as bureaucratic tyranny , and a violation of his civil liberties . In San Francisco the gay activists were strong for human rights , and had voted for Proposition 13 , too ; they tend to awn houses , and have no children to ; end to school . Such people like to beieve the leaders they elect are brave and principled , but punish them when hey act accordingly . It is political suicide , of course , really to cross the jevelopers , the big industries , the grow- ; to make people use car-pool lanes . 3ut one can fly to Tokyo , and chide the . apanese for killing the whale ; or when farmworker is killed , fly down to the mperial Valley to attend his funeral ; and drive around in a Plymouth in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reelection debt . N ONE OF THESE contradictions is peculiar to Brown , or unique to California , or new . In fact , the Jerry Brown era in California in the 1970s is an imitation of the John Lindsay era in New York City a decade ago . In both cases , beneath the general fascination with a beguiling politician lies an identical problem : an incompetence to deal with money , and a readiness simply to trade in images . In New York , of course , the fiscal crisis had been brought on by a lack of money . California politics were shaken to the foundation by Proposition 13 because there was too much money . But the essential dilemma in both cases was that the politician in question realized he could not at once pursue the Presidency and address the responsibilities of the office he already held . Lindsay , the maverick Republican , had to campaign for President as though free-spending liberalism had triumphed in New York City : he could not admit it was steadily going broke . Before Proposition 13 , Brown , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " era of limits " had triumphed in California ; he could not admit , so far as the torrent of state revenues pouring in was concerned , that there were hardly any limits at all . Indeed , as the years passed , Jerry Brown became more and more like the Sorcerer 's Apprentice . The louder he announced the " era of limits , " the big . ger the California state surplus grew . It was $500 million in early 1975 , when Brown took office , $2.7 billion just two years later . It had climbed ? unman . aged , ignored , and unused ? to nearly $6 billion by the time the voters ransacked the state treasury . A different kind of politician might have seen in this mountain of money a unique chance to reform society with vast new social programs , and given it all away ; or if he subscribed to another philosophy , he might have felt it his duty to return it to the taxpayers . Brown , for his part , perceived in this staggering fiscal imbalance a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would let the surplus stealthily grow . Then he would pre sent himself as the Democrat who had out-Reaganed Reagan in turning government indebtedness around . He would run for President not as having balanced the budget ? the California budget remains massively imbalanced. on the side of surplus , even today ? but as the politician who had proved that bureaucracy could make a profit . So through 1976 and 1977 . Brown treated the California surplus the way Lindsay had handled the New York debt , not as something real that could feed people , or make them hungry , but as a concept , an image , a political abstraction that , for political reasons , had to be suppressed . Before the 1978 California tax revolt , one heard the same things one earlier had heard about the New York deficit before the 1975 fiscal crisis broke : The surplus was overstated ; it was a temporary aberration ; it could be managed ; it hardly existed at all . But the voters of California knew better . They struck first . Of course once Proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-wing flat-earthers , just as during the fiscal crisis New Yorkers were condemned as welfare chiselers and socialist knaves . The larger lesson was ignored . It was that a politics of illusion can not make reality go away ; it only ensures that power migrates someplace else . If an elected governor would not deal with the surplus , then self-appointed manipulators for special interests like Howard Jarvis would . Proposition 13 no more disposed of California 's surplus than the New York " bail-out " disposed of New York 's debts . instead , in the guise of a tax revolt , there was a political revolution . Just as the fiscal crisis in New York transferred political control from elected officials and local government to the banks , the Municipal Assistance Corporation , and committee staffers in Washington , so Proposition 13 stripped power from city hall , the school boards , the elected officials , The real winners were the California state bureaucracy , which now holds the local purse strings , and the big corporate property owners , who will profit from the tax cut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the legislators and state administrators and the governor 's aides all spoke like people who had lost the capacity to determine events , and properly so . The most powerful man in the state is not the govJERRY BROWN NOTHING TO EVERYONE governor , on those occasions when he is at home ; or the Republican lieutenant governor , Mike Curb , a thirty-fouryear-old recording executive whose company produced " You Light Lp My Life " ; nor is it Leo McCarthy , the speaker of the assembly . It is Paul Gann co-author of Proposition 13 , and the proponent of another California constitutional amendment , to be pro . posed to the voters in 1980 . Where Proposition 13 merely reduces property taxes and effectively takes away from state government the power to raise them again , the new Gann proposal would limit government spending itself . The state government would be denied the power to increase spending even if it had the money . Most of the officials I met consider Gann 's " Spirit of 13 " initiative unwise , even wicked , and a fait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead , or even have the power to try . To the extent he is remembered as a governor of California , rather than as a media figure or Presidential candidate , it seems likely Brown will be recalled as the seer who did not see Proposition 13 coming , as the politician who prophesied greatness for the 1980s while embodying the 1970s paralysis of leadership here and now . " Everywhere Pat goes in California , " said June Degnan , who has known both Browns for years , " he gets standing ovations , the kind his son never does . It 's as though people miss the days when politicians were leaders , and believed government mattered . " T HE WEEK Jerry Brown left on safari , a move to outlaw desegregation-by-busing in Cali- fornia was approaching a climax : a nuclear reactor , a twin of the one in Pennsylvania , was a subject of great concern ; Brown had left dozens of judgeships vacant for more than a year . It was not that the governor favored de facto segregation or , conversely , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was an issue the governor could not profitably address at this time . As for the fear of a nuclear melt-down , the governor had asked that the plant be closed . Now it was for others to decide . He did appoint more than twenty judges just before he left , lest the lieutenant governor do it while he was away . " Jerry can make love to Linda on top of an elephant , so long as he leaves me alone , " a fellow passenger on a San Francisco trolley answered , when asked him about the Africa trip . If many people are apathetic about Brown and yet content to have him governor , it is because they do not care whether government matters and are satisfied that , under him , it does not . Observe , for example , Brown 's performance on the death penalty . In California , as elsewhere , capital punishment is like busing , a divisive , emotional issue , and leaders lead at their peril . Jerry Brown 's position was unequivocal and well known . Back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicted murderers in the state of California . Indeed , while his father was governor , Jerry Brown had fought against the Caryl Chessman execution with such fervor that many ? including Pat Brown himself ? believed the son 's position had cost his father reelection in 196G , when Ronald Reagan had defeated him by making law and order a major theme of his campaign . Now it was Jerry 's turn as governor . The legislature was moving to restore the death penalty . Would Jerry Brown choose political expediency and accept the measure , or pay the political price of his convictions and veto it ? The political problem was that expedience might hurt him politically even more than following his conscience would . Not only would Jerry Brown be perceived widely as abandoning a moral position for lack of political courage , he would be accused of having been all too wilting to endanger his father 's political career while refusing to take any such chances with his own . It seemed a situation in which , whatever he did , Jerry Brown was sure to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then and only then , many people told me , that his real mastery began to show . Could the legislature muster the necessary two-thirds majority to override his veto ? It seemed unlikely , until Governor Brown announced publicly that capital punishment was far too important a moral issue for politics to play a rote . He had followed his conscience . Now it was up to the legislators , without political interference , to vote their consciences , too . Privately , the word went down the governor 's chain of command : Not a single assemblyman or state senator was to be lobbied , not a single action taken in support of the governor 's own cause . In the end the death penalty was enacted , by exactly the necessary two-thirds vote . " We could have done it , " one of Brown 's former aides told me . " I personally knew at least two assemblymen who were waiting for the call . All Jerry had to do was pick up a telephone , but he refused . It was then I realized what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to go . " A person who still works for Governor Brown told the identical story , but he derived quite a different lesson from it . " Jerry 's a genius , " he told me . " He constantly turns political disasters into opportunities smaller politicians ca n't even sense . " As a result of the death-penalty maneuver , he pointed out , Brown had metamorphosed certain defeat into a multidimensional political success . He had proven to the reformers that he stands by his principles , while avoiding the political complications of flaunting his convictions in the face of public opinion . Friends of his father could not accuse him of disloyalty , nor the legislature criticize him for meddling in its affairs . And the lawand-order people had their death penalty , too . " It was the perfect political solution , " he said . " It showed Jerry doing what he dues best . " 1 N PERSON Governor Brown seemed older and smaller than he does on television . Contrary to what I had been led to expect , he was cordial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than his first , seven-minute inaugural address . I asked about his proposal for a constitutional convention . In Washington and New York , when it was reported Brown wanted a convention , many liberals were outraged : many conserva ? lives took heart . Some editorial writer ; and jurists started discussing the thing as if it would actually take place . Jr California , as in the East , the proposal divided people , too , but in a differen way . Some were upset because Brow ' did not really mean it , or so they be Bever ! . Others were not upset , for th very same reason . When 1 asked Brown himself , h described his support for a constitt clonal convention . using the same eaculus that had informed his stan against capital punishment . " I will have succeeded in my objective precisely if there is no constitutional convention , " he said . " The important thing is that the question has been raised , and people have started to think . " But what if it were held ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopting an amendment to balance the federal budget , " he answered . I was confused . He repeatedly had said a whole new agenda was needed for the nation , that it was time for the politicians to cede power to the people . Why not have a constitutional convention to do that ? " Oh no , " he replied , " that 's not what we want . " On his trips across the country , Brown had spoken as though his objective were to make every dime in taxes that came in equal every ten cents in government spending that went out , so I was intrigued when neither he nor his aides could give me any studies on what it all would mean . lithe federal budget were balanced , would taxes have to be raised , or the Pentagon budget cut ? Were we to do away with Social Security ? How many government employees would have to be laid off ? " I 'm trying to get the message across that we ca n't go on mortgaging the future , " the governor replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with such affairs as the Constitution and the balanced budget , or the diminishing returns of teaching people to read and write . Instead he dwelt on the catholicity of his intellectual tastes . At one point , Brown showed me two books he was reading : Carl Sagan 's The Cosmic Connection , and Muddling Toward Frugality , by Warren Johnson . " That 's the real challenge of the 19B0s , " he said . " How do we synthesize the two ? " Journalists have to listen to so many unoriginal people , it was hard not to be grateful . Jerry Brown has an interesting collection of ideas the way Nelson Rockefeller had an interesting collection of abstract art . He aspires to personify the future the way others want to embody avant-garde aesthetic taste . His frugality is famous , but it seemed to me as I listened to him that he is a consumer of a different sort : intriguing ideas are his microwave ovens , fascinating little books his mobile homes . He spoke of communing with the rhythms of the cosmos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to dance to whatever tune the present cares to play . If the polls show declining faith in education or in equal opportunity or in basic social services , then he will denounce these public works . If he can not head off Proposition 13 in California , then he will lead the tax revolt across the nation , because thither the Presidency lies , On the hidden costs of deficit spending he is brilliant ; for the price of his own ambition he has no critique . I remember Oliver Wendell Holmes 's reaction to Franklin D. Roosevelt , but with Jerry Brown it is the reverse . He has a first-class intellect and a second-class temperament . He can calculate exceedingly fine , but he has no sense ? in spite of Zen , and the years with the Jesuits ? of how legitimacy depends on conviction , how politics runs on faith . And so when one raises matters of substance with Jerry Brown , he will dance to the tune of the present , taking positions that reflect the polls , reciting phrases one has heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , is not much different from Jimmy Carter , or even Jerry Ford . w E MET one more lime , in Los Angeles , under circumstances so strange , so unique to California , that I report the encounter because I believe it composes a parable of Jerry Brown . In the office of Gray Davis , Brown 's chief of staff , a framed poem hangs on the wall : Do you know the feeling when you have been looking down , preoccupied , perhaps reading ? You suddenly become aware that someone has been watching you , without your realizing it . You look up , suddenly startled . We were driving , a friend and I , along one of those endless , neon-lit boulevards in west Los Angeles , looking for a Mexican restaurant . I had the glove-compartment light on . and was trying to navigate from a map . A car had been running beside us , in the next lane , for a number of blocks . Though traffic was not heavy , the neighboring car seemed deliberately to keep to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly I sensed it . I started , and looked up . A man in the neighboring car had been looking out at us for some time staring , studying us . It was the governor of California . There were other people in his car , a chauffeur , a guard , an aide , but they were seated in the normal position , looking ahead . Only he was swiveled around , gazing half-sideways , half-backwards , at us , while we all moved along at a speed of about fifty miles an hour , from a distance of less than ten feet . Why had he swiveled around , and stared ? Later I thought it was perhaps only that Brown is like some of those Hollywood stars , who can not tolerate anonymity ever , who try to make eye contact with strangers , for the satisfaction of making them recognize in the flesh the faces they have seen so often on the screen . But in that split second on the boulevard , I had an entirely different sensation . The relation of journalist to public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is always a one-way street . They have no right to secrets , we enjoy our privacy as a matter of law . All our inconsistencies , dishonesties , ambitions are private matters . Theirs are information the public has a right to know . For a second I sensed what it was like to be in his position , to be watched . Had Brown found some satisfaction in turning the tables , if only for a minute or two , while riding in a moving car : in staring at the journalist without the journalist aware that he was being seen ? As soon as he saw me start with recognition , Brown waved . We exchanged gestures , and followed the governor 's car around corners , down canyons , through the Hollywood night to his house . When we stopped , he got out , and came over . I rolled down the window . It was California : Where else can you interview a governor without getting out of a car ? We talked for a few minutes . Then he startled me again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . And again I had the sense the tables had been turned . Surely it was my function to ask the question , his not to see , but to be seen . I was not sure he was anyone 's magical friend , least of all his own . But I sensed in my person at that moment what he in ? tended for the nation : to make himself impossible to lose .
