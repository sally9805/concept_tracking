 | AUTUMN in Syria . The borders , as always , are troubled . To the east , the frontier with Iraq is sealed ; in Lebanon , turmoil ; on the Golan Heights , an occupying Israeli army . With two Syrian officers in an army Land-Rover , I course the sunny plain from Damascus to the foothills of storm-shrouded Mount Hermon . Then we lurch up a twisting dirt track that all but defeats the vehicle 's four-wheel drive . As we ascend , the temperature drops ; gusts of icy rain lash the windshield . Higher , fog closes in like dense smoke ; snow stings us in squally flurries . At 7,300 feet we halt by a concrete bunker ? now seen , now erased by the fog . The wind buffets our ears like some chaotic concerto . Two sentries in lumpy overcoats pull themselves to attention and present arms . This is one of Syria 's most sensitive outposts . A few hundred yards over the crest of the mountain lies a similar Israeli installation . Inside , the bunker is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plastic seal the sole fire port against the cold . A pressure lamp on a table flares with harsh , white light ; a kerosene stove emits a sparse halo of warmth . I crowd near it , sipping a glass of hot , sweet tea . With me are Lt. Col. Muhammad Halal , who commands the sector , and Lt. Ali Diab , who commands the bunker . Lieutenant Diab shrugs : " Life here is routine . From time to time there 's an aerial sortie , but otherwise little enemy activity . We watch by day , we patrol during the night . " When the British withdrew from neighboring Palestine in 1948 , Syria ? along with other Arab nations ? took up arms against the fledgling State of Israel . It has been a continuing war , with major hostilities in 1967 and again in 1973 . Colonel Halal , who commanded a battalion , reminisces about October 1973 : " The Syrian infantry achieved 75 percent of its initial objectives ; for once , the Arabs achieved surprise . But a flood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even tanks . The tide turned . But . by God , we fought all the way . " A long silence . The lamp throws distorted shadows on the walls . " What about now ?

Land Suffers History of Conquest The Syrian Arab Republic was born in 1946 in an ancient land swept for more than four thousand years by waves of conquerors ? Akkadians , Assyrians , Babylonians . Persians , Greeks , Romans , Byzantines . Crusaders , Turks , and Frenchmen . And for 30 of its 32 years of existence as a nation Syria has been at war ? a fact , I learned , that colors virtually every aspect of Syrian life . " This country , " a young Syrian told me , " could be a paradise . But since before I was born , more than half of our national budget has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d velop very little . Our natural resources remain almost untapped . " Nonetheless , the nation that many regard  | as the " Great Syrian Desert " offers endless surprises . Superb beaches line the Mediterranean ; eternal snows crown Al Jabal ash Sharqi along the Lebanese frontier ; magnificent cherries and apples grow in the uplands surrounding Idlib ; a new dam on the Euphrates is beginning to irrigate one and a half million acres of farmland . And , boasts the contemporary writer Gabriel Saade , " In Syria one can literally learn the history of the world ! All the gods have lived in our skies and all the great civilizations of the Mediterranean basin have flourished on our soil . " Modern Syria , however , presents a chronicle of chaos . In its first 24 years the nation saw 23 changes of government ? 15 by military coups . With war a continuing fact of life ? men are conscripted for two and a half years ? the army grew ever more powerful . Since 1949 most heads of state have been military officers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a disastrous merger with Egypt into the United Arab Republic . But Syria soon felt that it was being treated as a colony by its powerful partner , five times as populous . After three years the Syrians withdrew , and the U.A.R. perished . In 1963 Syria attempted another , equally unsuccessful alliance ? this time with Egypt and Iraq . Thereafter , governments rose and fell , most with socialist goals . The nation plunged into economic torpor as well as a xenophobia that isolated it from much of the world except the U.S.S.R. , which continues to provide arms and technological aid . Then , in 1970 , ( Continued on page 333 )  | Lt. Gen. Hafez al-Assad , representing the Baath , or Arab Renaissance , Party , led a " corrective movement " that was ratified in presidential elections the following year . A foreign observer described Assad 's policy as " to move the regime out of its isolation . . . and to strengthen the army . " Assad also introduced compulsory education ; currently Syria counts almost 1,800,000 students at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earlier , Syria became the first Arab nation to extend the vote to women . Assad was reelected in February of 1978 to another seven-year term . The Baath Party dominates Syrian political life , so he ran unopposed . Despite the heavy burdens of defense and debt ? including millions in repayments to the U.S.S.R. ? the Syrian economy continues to grow . In recent years Western Europe has replaced the Eastern bloc as the nation 's principal trading partner . Damascus , Islam 's Sacred Oasis My exploration of Syria began in the capital , Damascus . Many archeologists regard the city as the world 's oldest continuously inhabited settlement , and to Muslims it is sacred . Cradled in its green oasis , called AlGhutah , Damascus stands serene and beautiful in the desert . Devout Muslims believe that Damascus occupies the site of the Garden of Eden , and tradition holds that when the Prophet Muhammad looked upon the city he refused to enter it , not wishing to anticipate paradise .

Devout Gather for Pilgrimage Not everyone regards the innovations with approval . A high government official told me : " I look at what is happening in Damascus ? the new high rises , the swimming pools , the expensive hotels ? and I 'm filled with regret . New ways destroy old virtues . " Yet the past permeates the Syrian capital . You can still walk down the Street Called Straight , where Saul of Tarsus regained his sight almost 2,000 years ago . And the Suq alHamidiyah , the most magnificent of bazaars in the city , erupts daily in a frenzy of commerce . The best time to visit the suq is during the hajj , or pilgrimage . Every Muslim is adjured to journey , at least once in his life , to Mecca , the cradle of Islam . Damascus is a staging area , the last stop before the pilgrims plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much of the Islamic world streams through the suq . Whip-lean Afghans , squat Turks , tall Sudanese , Pakistanis , Iraqis , and Kurds shoulder their way through the swirl of Damascenes . Merchants cry the merits of their wares . Water sellers clang their little cymbals calling , " Atchan , taa saubi ! ? If you thirst , come to me ! " Sherbet sellers entice you with , " Refresh your heart ! Refresh your heart ! " Over vats of steaming corn , others cry , " Bedha ha-dara bedha ! ? White corn white ! " And everywhere the scents of spices and perfumes , the sinuous flash of brocades , and the sobriety of intricately inlaid wood . But the old days of happy bargaining ? " Regard it ! A pitcher of pitchers ! The sun and the moon of pitchers ! " " That ! It is dented , worthless . But , from charity , I will offer you 50 piasters " ? are disappearing . Most  | prices are fixed .

Beyond twin Corinthian columns that once bounded an immense Roman temple to Jupiter , the Suq al-Hamidiyah ends in a skirmish of booths selling perfumes and religious objects . Ahead looms the Umayyad Mosque , one of Islam 's holiest sites . The Umayyad dynasty reigned as caliphs in Damascus from A. D. 661 ? after the Arabs had wrested the city from the Byzantinesuntil 750 , when the rival Abbasids all but exterminated the Umayyads and moved the capital of Islam to Iraq . In that brief century Damascus dominated an empire that stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to China . Syria enjoyed an epoch of glory that still glows in folklore and legend .

His reign was predictably brief . But the Umayyads were builders , and the great mosque of Damascus is their monument . Upon the site of the pagan temple to Jupiter , Christians had erected the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist . With the church as a focal point , the Umayyads elaborated it into a structure more than 400 feet long fronting upon a magnificent courtyard . I visited it with a Syrian friend , Muhammad Kuteifan . As we threaded our way among the faithful , all of them intent upon their devotions , Muhammad told me , " Perhaps only one-third of all Syrian Muslims perform their religious duties . But the rest feel guilt . And I can assure you , for I am one of them , that all of them remain Muslims in their hearts . " We paused before an aged blind man in a yellow robe .

The Syrian capital is an overpopulated city , but perhaps its most crowded facility is the University of Damascus , grossly overtaxed by 45,000 very serious students . " The eye also feasts , " Syrians say of such appetizing arrangements in restaurant windows ( above ) . In another display near Suq al-Hamidiyah , Damascus 's teeming bazaar ( facing page ) , straw brooms and reed baskets await buyers . Though the government sets prices , some haggling persists . As one official admits , " Syrians can not live without bargaining . "  | On a pleasant afternoon I struggled through congested corridors to the office of Dr. Fuad Shaban , an associate professor of English .

Five or ten years ago there might have been difficulties , particularly for girls from small villages . But no longer . " Had Miss Keylani ever worn a veil ?

" Throughout their history , the Druzes have built a reputation as disciplined and ferocious soldiers . " Druzes are courageous because they do not fear death , " said Mr. Amer . " Every man believes that when he dies he will be instantly reborn as an infant . " When a Druze dies in battle , the mountains remember . As you drive through that charred terrain , you pass the elaborate tombs of officers killed in the 1973 war .

Crusaders Ruled " Beyond the Sea " From Latakia south , the Mediterranean washes a fertile littoral backed by the green range of Jabal an Nusayriyah . A memory haunts this coast ? a dream of medieval kings and barons , mailed knights and their wimpled ladies . For nearly two centuries , after they captured Antioch in 1098 , the Crusaders ruled here . From northern Syria to the Red Sea in the south they both conquered and built magnificent castles to guard the land that they called Outremer , Beyond the Sea . Vivid , turbulent , doomed , the Crusader states still kindle the imagination . Princesses with names like Melisende and Plaisance tied their favors to the lances of knights at Tripoli and Acre . Chivalric figures abounded . Richard Coeur de Lion and Louis IX of France fought there ; Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa , leading an army , died en route .

That number has swelled to more than three million dispersed throughout the world . Syria now hosts 225,000 Palestinians , many of whom as refugees are supported by United Nations funds for education , health , and food .  | The mightiest relic of Outremer still stands ? the Krak des Chevaliers , stronghold of the Knights of the Hospital . It looms on the summit of a 2,200-foot hill , commanding a vital pass that links inland Syria with the sea . From 1110 until 1271 , the Krak with its garrison of 2,000 troops resisted all attacks .

The dream that had intoxicated Christian Europe for two centuries died here . Dusk was gathering as I left the little courtyard before the cathedral . The pigeons fluttered on their evening errands and suddenly , from every minaret in the city , came the muezzin 's chanted call to prayer : " Allahu akbar . A shhadu allaa ilaha llah . . .

Nomads Seek the Perfect Pasture From Palmyra ? if you are willing to sleep under the stars and take potluck with the Bedouin ? you can hire a guide and strike due east across the desert . To Arabs the Bedouin are objects of romance . A Westerner might well wonder why . After all , they are only homeless nomads in search of a sweet , cool spring . Perhaps it is because they alone , in the sociological ferment of the Arab world , have preserved the wistful ideal of total freedom . Occasionally their black tents appear on the outskirts of the cities . Men with lean , weathered faces and squinted eyes stalk through the suqs , buying coffee and rope . Soon the black tents are gone , and the Bedouin are roaming their beloved barrens ? free of taxes and trauma and time . Free . Economic Hopes Rest on Damsite A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bring you to the ruins of Mari on the Euphrates , one of the great cities of the distant past . French archeologists have uncovered a palace of some 300 rooms and a library of 20,000 cuneiform tablets ? a sounding into antiquity that , according to one expert , " will take another 200 years to excavate ... completely . " From Mari a good road arcs northwest . It curves through a tawny , wasted landscape that rolls away into an infinity of emptiness . Even the Bedouin and their stringy flocks can find little sustenance here , and the eye searches in vain for their low tents . Suddenly you come upon ordered ranks of steel pylons ? some marching south , others west . The electric cables stretching between the skeletal towers create a peculiar 20thcentury latticework across the ageless desert sky . Follow the pylons and you will discover Syria 's most majestic engineering achievement ? the Euphrates Dam ( pages 338-9 ) . A thousand Russians and 12,000 Syrians spent ten years barricading the ancient river with a massive earthen wall . I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ? looking down into the jade waters of newly formed Lake Assad . Fish in huge schools swarmed at the base of the dam , periodically scattering before the darting shadow of a predator . Eventually Syria intends to plant the raw Under a beloved burden , a mother picks cotton near Tibni . Women make up a third of Syria 's labor force ; most work in agriculture , which is not yet heavily mechanized . Cotton planted in pre-independence days to make Syria the " cotton farm of France " now provides an export second only to oil as a revenue earner . A growing number of Syrian mills are expected to weave 75 percent of the nation 's cotton by 1980.  | banks with trees to create a vacationland of pines and water . Meanwhile , the dam ? with eight 103,000-kilowatt turbines ? is already providing 70 percent of the nation 's power . " At full capacity , " an engineer told me , " the dam could meet the future requirements of Syria , Jordan , and Lebanon . " In a huge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the Soviet turbines whirling lazily at 60 percent capacity . Their throb resounded in the ears like an audibilization of power . With Irrigation , the Desert Blooms Syria has bet most of its economic chips on this project , and electricity represents only one benefit . Lake Assad will ultimately stretch for 50 miles , storing 420 billion cubic feet of water . This reservoir will irrigate one and a half million acres , revolutionizing Syrian agriculture . Near the town of Ar Raqqah , experimental farms fed by dam-diverted water have been functioning for five years . Sugar-beet harvests have been running 250 percent greater than forecasts ; a breeding farm has adapted German Holstein-Friesian cattle to the Syrian climate so successfully that a dairy processing plant is being built . With construction of the dam already complete , a heavy responsibility has fallen upon Engineer Taha al-Atrash of SARICO , the Syrian company for irrigation constructions . For he and his crews must prepare an area as large as Delaware for cultivation . Engineer al-Atrash , a sturdy , dynamic man with a beret tugged low on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthmoving equipment . " All American ! All Caterpillar ! " he exclaimed proudly . " The best ! " Over the inevitable cups of coffee , he said : " We face serious problems here . The subsoil has a high proportion of gypsum . If we took no preventive measures , water seeping from the irrigation canals would dissolve the gypsum , creating subterranean hollows . Eventually the land and the irrigation system would collapse . This is not only our problem , incidentally , so anything we learn here will be of benefit to others . " International experts have studied the situation . We even held a conference on it in 1973 . Well , now we think we 're going in the right direction .  | We 're insulating canals with gypsum-free dirt . And we 're replacing bad foundation soil with good soil , concrete , or sand . " Engineer al-Atrash ushered me into his warehouse of Caterpillar spare parts . In his impeccably organized domain , pistons , huge blades , carburetors , oil filters stood in shadowy ranks , reinforcements waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , was a bathroom scale . " This is our policeman , " he said . " Everyone is weighed as he enters and again as he leaves . " He watched my face carefully , then he exploded in laughter . " It 's a joke ! " I laughed too . But I could n't help thinking that it was n't a bad idea . Later , by the Euphrates , I watched the great machines at work . The big yellow Cat scrapers came growling and skittering across the powdery soil . They threw up huge plumes of dust that the sun transmuted into pastel peach and gold as they swirled skyward . The ground flattened , almost miraculously , beneath the iron caress . " We 're not just digging canals and leveling ground here , " said Engineer al-Atrash . " We 're also building roads and village sites . What we 're really doing is bringing life to this part of Syria . " But elsewhere there is death . In the disputed Golan Heights I visited the Syrian city of El Quneitra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Syria , after heavy fighting , in 1974 . Empty , destroyed , as obliterated as ancient Tyre or Nineveh . The Golan Heights hold great strategic importance for both Israel , which regards them as a Syrian firing platform endangering settlements in Galilee below , and Syria , which is aware that Israeli posts on the highest hills scan the very streets of Damascus , only forty miles away . Lifeline of an empire lost : Limestone blocks of a Roman road laid 1,800 years ago ? part of a road system stretching from Rome to Arabia ? survive for half a mile in near-perfect condition west of Aleppo . A macadam highway , right , links the city to Azaz , near the Turkish border . From Aleppo , paved roads lead to Iraq and Jordan , helping Syria continue its role as a land bridge of the Middle East . The Syrians claim that the already war- the torn city was leveled systematically before the its return ? dwellings bulldozed and the re maining buildings looted and gutted . They pa call it a " martyr city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin ( page 357 ) . A United re ( Nations report cites much deliberate de- Sy struction . Israel holds that the damage was to caused by the guns of war booming from an both sides . But no matter where the blame is en assessed , the place evokes a sense of despair . Hope Blooms in Ruins of War r1 ab I saw Quneitra on an overcast day with hu gunmetal clouds scudding low above the pi ; ruins . Walking through the detritus struck co me as a foretaste of the day after the end of Sa  | the world . Not a single birdsong disturbed the gray , final silence . There is , in Quneitra , an ultimate checkpoint . You go down a straight road that flanks the sad , smashed dwellings and you reach a cluster of tank barriers ? the limit of Syrian authority . Perhaps a hundred yards to the west looms a United Nations outpost , and , beyond that , Israeli soldiers guard the entrance to the occupied Golan Heights . A tidy hut stands on the Syrian side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag snaps above it . Attentive hands have flanked the hut with artillery-shell cases , serving as planters for flowering shrubs . I fell into a conversation with two liaison officers , Lts . Samir Abbadi and Ahmad Kalaji , standing a three-day watch . With typical Arab courtesy , they invited me into the hut . " I am an expert maker of tea , " said Samir . " So much so that our neighbors of the UN ? who are our frequent guests ? presented me with a certificate of excellence . " He pointed to it , framed in a place of honor on the wall . The tea , in the Arab fashion , was burning hot and piercingly sweet . As we sipped it , I said , " Quneitra must be a depressing post . " One of the officers shook his head . " No . Even among the ruins , hope grows . Did you notice those flowers outside in the shell casings ? blossoms springing from the implements of war ? Just so , we of the Arab nation must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Must n't we ? "
