txt A very important question overhangs this year's. annual British budget . Can 50-50 socialism be made to work ? Or is there . a choice . to be made now for the sake of national prosperity between increasing the role of government still further or fairly drastically reducing it ? This is what is at stake . After six years of belt-tightening and " restructuring , " Chancellor of the Exchequer Roy Jenkins took with him to the House of Commons Tuesday at last a buoyant revenue , a huge surplus on his current account , and a payments surplus for the nation . But in the country out beyond Westminster , industrial growth was slow . Unemployment was relatively high . Profits were sluggish . People were tiring of high taxes , poverty remained a problem , and the pay-price spiral of inflation was ominously speeding up . In the main this is what Mr. Jenkins did : He made tax concessions that will cost the treasury . ? 200 million ( $480 million ) a year in revenue , a useful but clearly not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liglit for bank lending to rise 5 percent , again a little , but far from a lot . He announced that the prime rate of interest in Britain will be reduced to 7 percent from 7.5 , an improvement but still historically a crisis rate . He made a slight concession to importers , reducing the deposits they have to pay on goods imported at the time of their entry into the country from 40 to 30 percent . He eased the squeeze on investment in- come by raising the lower limit of " surtax " by ? 500 . He raised the tax-free allowances ( exemptions ) on earned incomes for both single people and married couples , by ? 75 and ? 90 pounds respectively , to free many lower-paid people from tax . // *Britain faces budget decision // His task , he declared , is " to maintain the strength we have won and guide the economy in steadily increasing growth . " In 1968 Britain was in the trough of crisis , Mr. Jenkins declared . By this time last year it had made progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still a hope and an aim . " Today we have solid achievement behind us . Over the past two years I have had to give priority to a massive switch of resources into the balance of payments , " he added . The improvement in the balance of payments has been dramatic . Today it is one of the strongest in the world . He had planned for a surplus of ? 300 million for the year 1969-70 and , although the final outcome will not be known until June , up . to last December the surplus was ? 451 million . For 1969.70 as a whole , it is unlikely that the surplus will be less than ? 550 million , he said . The five years to 1964 ended in a record deficit . The past five years have ended with a record surplus . And Britain has repaid three-quarters of all its huge short-term debts . This budget is more significant as a signpost than for the intrinsic im'portance of the measures within it . It is an election-year budget . For Prime Minister Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an election , has to call one within the next 12 months . Most commentators seem to think he will choose a convenient moment in October . But he does not have to . And if by then it looks as if this budget has indeed pointed Britain 's and Mr. Wilson 's mixed economy up the right road , he may well delay things until next year ' ? even perhaps until one more budget . In this way he and Mr. Jenkins could hope to get the advantage of two ' election budgets instead of only one . An end to stop-go ' But what this budget and the events that follow it have to point to are these goals : ? An end at last to " stop-go . " Boom . and bust in government policy . Expansion followed by sqUeeze . ? The ability to sustain a British payments surplus over a period of several years . ? The containment of inflation . ? The quickening of productive investment . ? The further relief of poverty . ? But finally a chance for everyone to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electoral arguments will revolve around that last requirement , coupled with the containment of inflation .
