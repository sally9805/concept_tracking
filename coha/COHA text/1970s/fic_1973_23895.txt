BALDESSUCIS DEAD SEA FLIGI ITS TritEffil " - VipH . F1 " 11 " ii. /C 3 I r . q1 f , 1 110 i , 10 .11 ; . % ? O N THE FLATLANDS between Denver and Oklahoma City there is an airstrip built in the early Fifties that is unused now except by an air charter service named Ciafu Flying , which attempts to fly a fairly regular route between the two cities , carrying , for the most part , vegetable and meat preservatives , tenderizers , emulsifiers , and food stabilizers , Ciafu Flying 's clients being a loose collection of the taco , roast beef , hamburger , and fish-and-chip franchises of either city . Off to one side of the abandoned airstrip were the remains of a hangar . An old man sat beside the hangar and stared silently across the dirt airstrip overgrown with weed , prairie grass , and cannabis that moved and shifted in the random winds of the place . The man straightened up against the hangar , tilted up the straw hat he wore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far end of the airstrip , faltering , sinking , settling finally to the earth . The port engine emitted graceless wisps of smoke and oil : both engines coughed and sputtered . The plane taxied with a list . The old man watched the pilot , Baldessari , bring the plane to a halt , climb to the ground , pull out a handkerchief , hack into the dust . Then the old man watched lialclessari stare curiously at him across the field . Baldessari was unshaven , fat , wore a T-shirt : a slight southwestern wind ruffled the shirt . Dust powdered the bottom of his cords . He lit a cigarette , cupping the match against the wind , and smoked in short , cheerless puffs . It was not very long before a Piper Apache appeared low over the grass strip , settled smoothly to the earth , and taxied next to the 310 . The pilot cut the motors , climbed out of the Apache , and hurried into the 310 . Baldessari headed toward the new plane , flipping the other pilot the bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Apache , and the other pilot , after some effort , started the engines of the 310 . They taxied to the end of the airstrip and took off in the direction from which they had come . The old man watched carefully . He nodded to himself , stood up , tilted his hat low over his head , and shuffled off to his home . The gentleman walked through the yard , up the steps , into the house , and took off his hat and laid it on the sofa . " Two planes landed . One good , one bad . The pilot from the bad plane flew the good one away . The pilot from the good plane flew the bad one away . " The woman looked up suspiciously . " What 's it mean ? " The gentleman settled into the sofa , looked away , closed both eyes : " It means some people get good stuff and some people get bad stuff The people that get had stuff get screwed . " T HERE IS A GREAT FLAT PLAIN of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tides , pulling and tugging , causing great wave : of it to sweep silently from Texas to Oklahoma to Colorado and back , great silent unstoppabl. dry movements that are a secret between the white hovering moon and the earth . Baldessari can see it , ' eel it , when he flies over the abandoned landscape of eastern Colorado . The dust : it washes and wears against the edges of the cities that are built upon the plains . At the farthest edge of the last suburb of any prairie city , at the last row of houses , at the last fence , is the dust that stretches to the horizon . At the western edge of the plains is Denver , port city to this long-dead sea . And as weight lifters thank God that things are heavy , so too do the horny thank Him for this oasis . In Denver on East Colfax , between a Ski-Doo dealer and a tackle shop , is a dating bar called the Sperm and Ova that is frequented by the first-generation dental assistants , receptionists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barmaids who have come in off the plains to live beyond their emotional means . Next door to the tackle shop that borders the Sperm and Ova is the Enola Gay , raffish hangout of charter pilots , mechanics , ground crews , crop dusters , ex-Air Force people . One night Christopher Baldessari , drunk on Coors , the local product , crude in some old corduroys and Hawaiian shirt , came ricocheting out of the Enola Gay , past the tackle shop , and stumbled blindly into the Sperm and Ova . That was where he met Didi , first-generation stew . S OME AFEINITLES CAN BE touchstones : perhaps Stewardess is subconsciously pointed in the direction of Pilot . If Deidre was her Christian name , then Didi was a cabalistic one . She was mysterious and subtle-seeming , a prime-looking lady who hid herself in a hundred looks : corning on foxy in hell-bottoms and pout ; or showing up innocent in pigtails and knee socks ; or appearing in stockings and heels , looking quite prepared for a sexual event of the highest caliber . Baldessari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rape , wondered why he deliberately cultivated schizophrenia . She lived in a townhouse complex , a place of generally bad resonance close to the airport built when the sun was in Gemini and the moon in Aries and filled with other stews and airport personnel . And Baldessari , after several nights of casually hanging around the Sperm and Ova playing various minor roles , mostly that of pilot , which he found he had to play even though he was one , found himself one evening standing on the balcony outside Didi 's apartment , holding a drink and staring down at the tennis courts , game areas , and swimming pool , his witty line being , " Let me take you away from all this . " Which got from Didi only a look . Intimacy between the two did not come with a gentle touch or with some shared embarrassment , but with the simple step of Baldessari T " E OLD MAN STARED ACROSS the airfield . He coughed slightly , hand over mouth , but the sound escaped , went tumbling southward toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plane and into the dust . He watched Baldessari stare curiously at him across the airstrip . Baldessari thinking that being on the ground in western Kansas is almost the same as being in the air . Baldessari shuffled his feet in the dirt and wished he were waiting alone . Bennett , which was the name the FAA put on its maps for the place , was 280 miles from Denver , 330 from Oklahoma City . The other pilot , one Compton Sheats , necessarily arrived in Bennett after Baldessari , since they both left at ten every morning , Ciafu Flying supposedly establishing some regularity of schedule to qualify for a federal mail contract between the two cities . Sheats ' perpetual lateness gnawed at Baldessari . Waiting at Bennett had become a focal point of Baldessari 's day . He woke each morning knowing he was flying into a minor vacuum over which he had no control . Baldessari was not sure how the vacuum had come into existence ; he did not know what to do about it . Maybe on other planets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with two beings flying madly between them . Baldessari hoped so : the redundancy would offer unity , completeness ; certain absurdities might be lessened by the sheer number of participants . Otherwise Baldessari was one of only two men in the entire universe who landed at Bennett and changed planes . The thought was not appealing . Sheats had the Apache again . Baldessari heard the faint buzz of it , the only noise at Bennett . He saw it appear , saw it come in low to land , and then watched awestruck as it began to climb toward the sun , Baldessari suddenly running after it across the flat face of Kansas screaming at the plane to get the fuck down here . Sheats dove , banked tightly , and came in low over the airstrip , and Baldessari could see Sheats staring down at him with disapproval . Then Sheats smiled at Baldessari : he stayed low over the earth , circled off to the south , and became a dot . Baldessari stared . Sheats sat out there in the far sky playing with perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreground , then retreating again an inch or two above the horizon , a small mark , waiting to be erased . He disappeared from the scene entirely , leaving only a noise . l le puttered about the countryside , generally using up fuel , and then he sneaked back over the horizon and put the thing down upon the earth , taxied to Baldessari , cut the engines , climbed out , and with a large Oklahoma smile on his red face hurried into the waiting 310 . Baldessari , hurrying by him , flipped him the bird , got into the plane , and started the engines . The two planes taxied , took off , and the pilots headed hack to where they had come from . It was quiet , the sky and earth abandoned . The old man leaned against the hangar and stared across the field : the impression of Baldessari flipping the bird remained mysteriously in the air , a sign , a gesture , the very finger , may-he , pointing to the heating heart of God . It carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insult first appeared in the lexicon of emotions , when the first oblique knowledge lodged in some primal consciousness that some poor fool of an anthropoid had not risen to the expectations anticipated of him , that , as a result , anger Hashed and dour wit came exploding out in gesture , word , whatever , and , yes , accompanying it was the first dim wrench. ing knowledge that , jesus god , there are going to be expectations , criteria , a code , for this long stay here on earth . ALDESSmu FLEW LOW over the prairie towns B that had an airstrip and a hangar or two and a ragged row of parked planes ; he slowed , circled , seeing if he recognized any of the planes . People from the Enola Gay flew out this way : crop dusters in biplanes , ex-Vietnam pilots on random charter flights , amateurs in P51s and P48s , pilots of varying degrees of flakiness who made unscheduled flights over the Mexican border and back . Baldessari , like most of the pilots who flew the area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every airstrip someone had taken the trouble to lay down , filling up with fuel , having a sandwich and coffee , then taking off . There were queer places out there , places Baldessari 'd dropped into and never visited again , maybe could n't even find again if he 'd wanted : small isolated towns whose populace was inbred , Baldessari catching glimpses of the same gesture , the same facial characteristic , in everyone ; towns whose anonymity was sought by the deformed and cast-off ; towns of the old , that smelled like the blue hair of near-dead ladies . Baldessari had landed in towns that had no discernible reason for existence , towns where sometimes he 'd see a look , a cast , that he had last seen in a town fifty miles to the east . Strange tides of genes and private sadnesses flowed and dispersed to the rhythms of some unknown law : Baldessari coming upon whole towns that were sunk into a black catatonic depression , life at a standstill ; all these towns whose only link if there was any link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnivals with their Oklahoma flatland prairie girls who did their thing in the back tent or the fourteen- and fifteen-year-olds who married and settled in another part of the plains , returning home only to attend funerals , births , basic life/death events worth the trouble of traveling for . DALDESSARI SHOWED nun some of this : the two of them flew low over the earth toward Kansas , suspended over a large flat brown ma ? nila envelope for which no amount of postage would suffice . Didi frowned : small precise wrinkles appeared momentarily above her nose disappeared . The rand took on more than it offered thanks to granny glasses of a purplish/ rosy tint . She was in her stewardess uniform : wry humor for this excursion ; she had packed a picnic hamper of United Air Lines food finger sandwiches , cocktail nuts , artful little cakes , a rattling collection of basic airline liquor , ten or fifteen 1/10-pint bottles of bourbon , Scotch , and whiskey . Didi , slightly white against the primary colors of her lipstick , makeup , and uniform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posture and decorum taught in girlhood , Baldessari realizing she had probably never seen anyone actually fly before , that she was maybe apprehensive at the ease with which he had lifted them from earth , no flight crew , navigators , computerized flight patterns , just he , Baldessari , who was now maybe rubbing it in a bit , flying low , catching every thermal updraft , tacking this way and that over the flat earth . A general aura of wind , vibration , and engine noise surrounded them , intruded upon only by static and by a voice Didi said she knew , the cool , low-key voice of Denver control tower granting permission for someone to come to earth , a voice smooth , unruffled , cultivated , it seemed , off some free-form FM radio . At Bennett Didi climbed out of the plane and stepped into the dust and scrub grass and stood still for a moment staring at what was Kansas . Baldessari brought out the hamper and a blanket . " There 's the old man . " Didi laughed , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited the old man to join them in lunch , and , after he sat down on a corner of the blanket , he made himself comfortable and drank two small bottles of bourbon . The deep wrinkles of his face held midday shadows . His eyes were watery blue , glaucomatous , and Baldessari wondered if for all his staring at him he had seen anything . The man removed his straw hat , laid it beside him on the blanket , and accepted his lunch as if Baldessari should have brought it long ago . They ate quietly , small winds scuttling dust across the blanket , and Baldessari listened for the sound of the Apache . When Sheats landed , Didi , Baldessari , and the old man watched without speaking . Sheats climbed out of the plane , looked at the blanket and the bottles and the food without expression , and hurried into the 310 . " Thank God we do n't have to go to Oklahoma City , " Didi said . " Precisely , " Baldessari said . The old man nodded . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blanket , and put their things in the hamper . Baldessari looked at the old man . " See you tomorrow . " The man nodded . Baldessari and Didi taxied by the old man in the Apache , Baldessari gunning it , Didi looking hack at the gentleman , standing alone , casting a small noon shadow upon the dust . IIIHE SHORTNESS OF AFFAIRS and decrease in 1 permanent relationships is some obscure step in the evolution of man whose purpose can not yet be determined , was Baldessari 's theory . Baldcssari would be gone for hours at a time on his flights and Didi would be gone for days on hers . Sometimes she would switch schedules , or be shunted onto other flights , and return at curious hours carried beyond exhaustion on nerves hyped by time changes , speed , pressurization , and the cities she 'd touched down in , her nervous system kindled beyond reason by its odd touches with America and forty-three cups of coffee . Didi took Baldessari on one of her routes , to places Baldessari had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kansas City . He got on hoard through sonic low-air fare scheme of Didi 's and , once airborne , felt a vague despair at having given up his destiny to pilots and crew he did n't know . Didi walked up and down the aisle , looking good in heels and black stockings , dressed to please a nation of traveling fetishists . Stews hustled back and forth and liquor flowed . Didi hurried by , winked , Baldessari smiled . Or was that Didi ? They all dressed the same . The passengers were brought bottle after bottle of booze . The fear was communal , came free with the purchase of every 727 . They spent the evening in Minneapolis or Chicago , Didi , laughing at Baldessari 's sense of displacement , refusing to tell him which . They visited three or four clubs where Didi knew people : other stewardesses , pilots , airline people , some of whom Baldessari had met in Denver , the clubs identical to ones in Denver , the parking lots filled with the same cars , the kind all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colts , Pintos , sprightly little automobiles named after the first warm thing American womanhood had wrapped its thighs around . Detroit being no fool . The night was passed in a stew 's apartment who , yes , was in Denver that night , a fact leading Baldessari to suspect he was receiving an ill-focused picture of some vast complicated linkage he was not a part of , something he was being allowed to glimpse the outer edge of , with perhaps more revelations to follow , if only certain steps were successfully passed . He returned with Didi to Denver the next day via Kansas City , Moline , Omaha , or some such , and he felt better than he had in ages . He wondered why : Didi ? the booze ? the force-fed oxygen ? A damned fine way to feel . Which was probably exactly what Didi wanted to show him . Get him out of Bennett while there was still time . Thus , once home : " Jesus , what a bummer you are . Fly halfway to Oklahoma City and back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as any sane man would , and you 're back for dinner . " " Sheats knows this barmaid in Oklahoma . He does n't want to spend every other night in Denver . " " Sheats , " Didi said . " God ... " " I do n't want to spend every other night in Oklahoma . " Didi glared . She had a set of gestures , facial expressions , blinking of eyes , pouts , frowns , casual smiles that she had acquired over the years during various sexual situations ( which the present argument was ) . The coyness she sometimes used still brought the same reaction it had eight years before in junior high in West L.A. " Do n't you know Ciafu 's making an ass out of you and Sheats ? " Baldessari said nothing : Ciafu being the one who figured that a simple solution to many problems would be to have his pilots change planes halfway between points of destination . " Christ , " Didi said . " I bet Ciafu had to hunt all over , give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found two people that failed them . Two people who want to underachieve . You have to lack something to fly only halfway to a place day after day . " There being some truth to what Didi was saying , Baldessari was thinking : mayhe they could move . Go east . Maybe Dick . could just transfer to another airline , merely change uniforms , stews probably being free from those difficulties en- countered by Jesuits jumping to the Dominican Order , Dominicans to the Capuchins . " Most people would want to go all the way . " " Bennett is all the way . " " For you . " She was getting dressed . Their arguments came whenever she had to leave ; proceeding out the door before any conclusion was reached . She was putting a small hat on her head , topping off a very neat package . Nothing messy ; you knew she was going to work at someplace clean . And Baldessari , unshaven , hairs protruding from the area of his belly , with eyes that seemed not to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at him . " Something 's missing . Do n't you feel something 's missing ? " Baldessari shrugged . " You be home tonight ? " Hands on hips , her mouth a moue , standing by the door , Hollywood exit , she slowly shook her head no . R ALDESSARI STARTED HIS FAT , decrepit Olds . A small blue-white ball of smoke appeared from the exhaust , lingered , caught the hot weak wind , stretched and thinned , and moved acrossthe road . It hung there , alone , conspicuous , cloudlike , sitting halfway between the grass and the skein of smog over the city it 'd soon join . Denver was filled with a yellow-brown cloud that held the thin sunlight and diminished any clarity . The vague dark fingers of the stuff reached into the canyons of the mountains , the thick heavy palm of it lay over the city . The city was hypertense , as if the flickering of the stoplights and mercury lamps was causing vibrations other than those that caused waves to enter the visible spectrum . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brown like the plains to the east : the haze contained its own heat , its own maneuverings , its private winds ; it dictated life-styles , demanded obeisance from lungs and hearts . Psyches warped , changed shapes , curled at their farthest ends , withdrew upon themselves , and then became irritable when even this small portion was stepped on . Baldessari taxied the 310 to the end of the runway , the plane partaking in slight , graceful bounces over cracks in the cement . Didi . God : Didi . More initials . FAA , VHF , ETA , DD . She could n't see him for a while ; her gynecologist said , she said . What did Baldessari know ? There were people in cities all over the United States she told everything to . Doctors , analysts , lawyers , dentists , stews , girlfriends , pilots , and ground crews knew more of her secrets and problems than Baldessari : a great underground of people who knew Baldessari secondhand . Once , twice , several times Baldessari thought he heard mention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierced by static , comments emanating from cockpits and control towers discussing Baldessari 's habits and his odd flights halfway to any decent destination . He was positive he caught the names of the Sperm and Ova , of various clubs around the country . Didi 's name was spoken continuously . He heard the names of Didi 's friends he had met . Again he heard his own name . He felt he had stumbled onto some vast inner core of America , a great web whose strands stretched across the country , interwoven voices and static-pierced broadcasts of wants , desires , greeds , and simple communications . Then , abruptly , Baldessari ceased to hear his name at all , and he wondered if he had imagined it . He listened intently . He decided , after much thought , that his name had just stopped being spoken . Baldessari peered eastward , could see the lip of smog that ended not far from Denver . The tower finally gave him clearance , but he waited still longer ' before leaving , careful to avoid the turbulence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra minutes until it was gone , a speck in the sky , before beginning his takeoff down the long runway . ?
