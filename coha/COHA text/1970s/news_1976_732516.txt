txt There is the joke about the pilot coming in for a landing at Salisbury Airport . He tells his passengers the altitude , the weather conditions , the temperature , and then he says : " Do n't forget to set your watches back 10 years . " A visitor to Salisbury undergoes time warp . The songs are old , the fashions are old , and the jokes  --  even the ones about being behind the times  --  are old . Along the broad avenues named after the heroes of African exploration and empire-building  --  Rhodes , Baker , Stanley  --  there are women in miniskirts and men with short hair and neckties as narrow as Prime Minister Ian D. Smith 's . A radio listener Is apt to hear within the space of 15 minutes Bing Crosby , Nat King Cole and Doris Day . On television there is Roy Rogers , downing a varmint with a single blow , and Dale Evans brushing off his sleeve . It all contributes to a sense of never-never-land serenity , and it makes the guerrilla war ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If your dad 's been called up , you can feel proud " ? seem as though it 's happening in another country . The rest of the world may feel that Rhodesia 's 270,000 whites are perched on the edge of an abyss of racial war , but there is no hardedged sense of impending disaster here . On the surface life is as it always has been  --  paradisiacal in an outpost of colonialsuburban living where whites have the highest per capita ownership of homes , automobiles and swimming pools in the world . In the evenings , on . the hotel veranda , there is still the " sundowner , " a cooling drink brought by a black waiter who is smiling and attentive . In the mornings , In Salisbury Park , there is still ' the gentle click of bowls , rolled across a clipped lawn . by white-haired gentlemen fully clothed in white . " Whites here retreat into the luxury , " said a British writer who has lived here 27 years . " They have been bombarded with politics so long that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The feeling is ' leave it to good old Smithy . ' " You must remember when economic sanctions were imposed , the whole world said the Government would crumble in a matter of weeks . It did n't . Over the years there have been so many dire predictions from the outside world that did n't come true , the whites are hardened to them . They just do n't believe them . " BiirtherFare signs that the guerrilla activity is beginning to make psychological inroads . At cocktail parties in the northern suburb of Highland , now lush with blooming trees , the conversation turns to , " Where else is there to go ? " " You know , " says one young woman raised ; n Zambia , " when you 've been in Africa so long and the sun goes behind the clouds , you feel chilled . " Some of the ranchers v , , h , o live in the northeastern region of the country , tired of sleeping with guns under their pillows , have " packed it in " and moved into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grazing land are up for sale at mckbottom prices . The newspapers , now under heavy censorship , carry an increasing number of reports on attempts to circumvent the rigorous exchangecontrol law that limits the amount of Rhodesian currency that can be exported . One man bought more than $6,000 in lottery tickets under the names of friends in South Africa . Another shipped out three RollsRoyces , including one that used to belong to the Duke of Windsor , and started a new ranch in Dallas . A black market is beginning and American dollars are prized . On weekday nights , the strip-tease clubs play to nearly empty houses . At the Matelot , where old taboos are honored and the black waiters retire to the kitchen when the white dancers come on the floor , there were only two diners at 10 P.M. last Wednesday . " Three months ago this place was jumping , " says the South African drummer , lighting a cigarette on his break . " I guess all the chaps have gone to the front . " ? Enkeldoorn is a small town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of Afrikaaner territory . It felt so strongly about white rule that in 1954 , when the British joined what was then Southern Rhodesia into a federation with two predominantly black territories to the north , the town seceded . It was a joke , of course , but even today , with the federation long since dissolved , the joke is taken semiseriously . The " Republic of Enkeldoom " centers on the Enkeldoom Hotel or , to be more precise , on its safari-motif bar . If a traveler is accepted , the bartender will stamp an Enkeldoorn visa on his passport . If not , he is liable to be tossed into a makeshift " jail . " Buck Rogers is the president of the republic  --  an inscription on his bar stool says so . The other night , as Mr. Rogers was berating Henry A. Kissinger , the subject turned to " ters " ? short for " terrorists , " which is what the guerrillas are called here : " The ters are all around , " he said , dropping his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're meeting in Gwelo . They 're planning something big . Right in Salisbury . " The whisky has perhaps heightened his sense of the dramatic , for in fact there have been no sightings of guerrillas or any incidents within miles of Enkeldoorn . " They 've got bloody AK 's and all we 've got is pellet guns , " he continued , referring to the AK-47 Soviet-designed rifle . " I got 10 bullets . That means I 'll get me 10 ters , right in the forehead . " He held his hand up in the shape of a gun and was about to demonstrate when the bar company swept him up in a rousing version of " Across the Sea to Ireland . " ? White Rhodesians frequently say that they are fighting a war against Communism and that for this reason the West wo n't turn Its back on them . They also say that if they left the country the blacks would fall into tribal warfare and everything the whites have built up , epitomized by the sparkling skyscrapers and manicured public gardens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to support it except passion , and the passion runs strong . " I feel very strongly that we are fighting for the survival of Western civilization , ' ' said Bill Searle , the owner of a company that manufactures prefabricated housing . " We have three sons at the front , " said his wife , Shirley . " We 're comitted to this country . If we did n't like it so much we would n't stay here . " Their fourth son , Dudley , was going up to the front next week , and so they were giving him a dinner at the 12,000 Horsemen Restaurant in the Hotel Monomatapa . Dudley saw the conflict differently . He felt that the blacks deserved more than the whites have given them " and fast . " But he was willing to fight just the same because " the ters are just thugs . " The party was interrupted by a bomb scare at the hotel . The guests milled about outside while khaki-uniformed policemen searched the 19-story building . Nothing was found . It was surmised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guerrillas . It came from university students as a prank to interrupt a dinner celebrating the publication of their humor magazine .
