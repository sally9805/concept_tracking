txt After nearly a year of study of youth crime in America , the prestigious Twentieth Century Fund recommends court reforms to reduce lockup time for offenders under the age of 21 . The report comes at a time when there are many efforts to try mire juveniles in criminal courts and treat them as adults . In a 120-page report released April 5 , the Twentieth Century 's task force , chaired by Robert Taft Jr. , former U.S. senator from Ohio , made these sweeping recommendations : ? That juvenile courts keep jurisdiction over all defendants up to the age of 18 . In many states youthful offenders over 16 are tried in adult criminal courts . ? No incarceration for juvenile first convictions for property crimes and extensive use of alternative sanctions , and a 21/2-year maximum sentence in custodial confinement for any property offense committed before the defendant 's 21st birthday . ? For minor offenses against a person , including fistfights and schoolyard extortions , the task force recommends " no minimum sanction and a maximum sentence of 18 months of custodial confinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbery where the defendant used a deadly weapon or inflicted grievous bodily harm , the task force says " minimum sentences of custodial confinement are worthy of consideration . " ?

" According to the report , 13- to 20-year-olds " comprise about 9 percent of the population but they account-for more than half of all property crime arrests and more than a third of all arrests for offenses involving violence . " Judge William Booth , acting New York Supreme Court Justice , says there is a national trend to " lower the age at which a juvenile can come into the criminal court from 16 to 12 .

Traditionally , juvenile courts have been somewhat more lenient than criminal courts . Juvenile courts were set up in 1899 to consider the special needs and problems of youthful offenders . But recognizing that juvenile courts with jurisdiction up to 18 years of age may , indeed , encounter some extremely serious offenses , the task force report says state law could provide for these by providing for the transfer of cases to criminal court . Some dissented While the majority of the task force feels that the least harmful method of dealing with serious cases of juvenile crime is to transfer them to criminal court , some task force members dissented . Task Force member Sister M. Isolina Ferre says she " opposes the waiver of juveniles to the adult criminal justice system under any conditions , given the chaotic state of the criminal courts .
