From time to time , the members of the cast line up , face the audience and flash shy , charming smiles . They march a lot too , keeping time by smacking sticks and shaking tambourines . They love to pretend they are being birds and animals . If necessary , they will speak . But they prefer to sing , dance or grunt as they mime their mysterious little charades-a kind of **26;5478;TOOLONG . <P> Precocious at a kindergarten assembly ? Wrong . Joseph Chaikin 's off-off-Broadway Open Theater . But that first impression may not be entirely mistaken . For the Open Theater plays a brilliant game of neo-innocence . It peels down actors to their childlike selves and doubles back to drama 's origins : religious processionals , Dionysian revels . <P> Chaiki-a monkish-looking alumnus of the Living Theater-is also stripping the Tired Old Theatergoer to his pre-prop basics . Audiences bored with seeing curtains go up on living rooms that imitate their own will find themselves confronted by inner rather than outer realities . Chaikin says that he is striving toward " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In other words , the pure joys , and terrors , of make-believe . <P> Beginning to Surface . Since 1963 , the Open Theater has been testing theories and practices chiefly before semiprivate audiences in small New York theaters or at the anonymous distance of European stages . Chaikin is a fervid anti-publicist who has kept underground despite the Open Theater 's operative role in two famous productions : Jean-Claude van Itallie 's America Hurrah and Megan Terry 's Viet Rock . Whether Chaikin wants it or not , his Open Theater troupe is beginning to surface as one of the best experimental companies in the U.S.-and certainly the most disciplined . <P> During a recent visit to Harvard 's Loeb Drama Center , the Open Theater demonstrated its traditional expertise at oldfangled script-drama with a superbly subtle production of Endgame . Chaikin himself counterpointed Beckett 's black doomsplay with a singsong , smiling-Buddha portrayal of blind , crippled Hamm . Beckett 's line , " Nothing is funnier than unhappiness , " might have served as production motto . <P> Ceremony of World Birth . But Cambridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Open Theater : Terminal and The Serpent . Death is the deliberative theme of Terminal , but as with Endgame , there was a paradoxical buoyancy to the brief evening ( playing time : a little over an hour ) . In fact , the moments that pretended to morbidity were the moments that failed-most conspicuously , a deadpan lecture on the art of embalming and a rather derivative attempt to dramatize dying , American-style , as an induction center through which the imminent dead get processed like draftees . <P> On the other hand , a savage dance of chanted resistance to death-to say nothing of Viet Nam and polluted air-burst with demonic energy . For Terminal reverses the adage to read : In the midst of death , we are in life .
