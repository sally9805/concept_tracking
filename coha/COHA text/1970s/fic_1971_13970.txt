Seedy wallpaper with pictures of cowboys peeling off the wall . Photographs of Hank Williams and Jimmie Rodgers . Stuffed dolls , crucifixes . License plates from southern states nailed to the wall . Travel poster of Panama . A funky set of drums to one side of the stage . An electric guitar and amplifier on the other side . Rum , beer , white lightning , Sears catalogue . CAVALE has kidnapped SLIM off the streets with an old . 45 . ( She wants to make him into a rock-and-roll star , but they fall in love . We find them after one too many mornings . They 're both mean as snakes . SLIM is charging around screaming words ; CAVALE is rummaging through junk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on them in this state . ) SLIM Wolves , serpents , lizards , gizzards , bad bladders , typhoons , tarantulas , whipsnakes , bad karma , Rio Bravo , Sister Morphine , go fuck yourself !

Oooooooooooooooooh what can I do but just keep on loving you ? * " You Cheated , You Lied . " Copyright 1961 by Patricia Music Publishing Corporation . All rights reserved . Used by permission . Fuck it . ( He stops . CAVALE finds Raymond the dead crow and talks to him . ) CAVALE Oh , here 's my baby . Here 's my little crow . He 's no crow , I was jes ' fooling . We 're the crows , me and you , Raymond . ( she sings him something like the theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around with that dead crow ? It makes me sick ! It 's morbid and black and dark and dirty ! It makes me sick ! Ca n't you see what 's happening here ? Here we are stuck in some border town , some El Paso town , and you 're fucking around with a dead crow . I should just leave and go back to my family . My little family . My little baby . I should , should n't I ? Should n't I ! CAVALE Fuck you . Fuck you . Fuck , fuck .

C'mere though . ( SLIM goes to her and curls up in her lap . ) CAVALE Johnny Ace . Johnny Ace . Johnny Ace was cool . He was real cool , baby . Just like you . And he came East from Texas and no black guy had a hit record and no rock-and-roll boy had a hit record . And in rode Johnny Ace , from a moving train , pledging his love . That was his best song , man . What a great fucking song . And all the girls would cry when he sang . He sang all them pretty ballads . And one day when all the girls were waiting , when everybody paid their fare to see Johnny Ace on stage in person singing sad and dressed in black , Johnny Ace took out his revolver , rolled the barrel like his 45 record , played Russian Roulette like his last hit record , and lost . Johnny Ace blew his brains out , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shout Johnny Ace blew his brains out . p. 5 SLIM You think that takes balls , I suppose . Do you ? CAVALE Oh man . You 're always saying that shit . Why do n't you just play ? Just play , it do n't mean nothing , it 's just a neat story . Fuck . You always wreck everything . Jus ' like when I told ya ' about Villon . You never just listen , you always got to place stuff . And hey , fuck you , you asked me to tell you it . I ai n't telling you no more stories . ( she gets teary and nervous ) SLIM Aw , come on , baby . Baby crow . Do n't crow , baby crow . I 'm sorry . I love ya ' . I love ya ' to tell me stories . It 's like listenin ' to the streets . Ya ' know ? Like listenin ' to summer sounds . Like it could be the dead of winter but some kind of sound like just a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why I love your stories . I 'm sorry , baby . CAVALE Baby . Baby . Baby . Slim , I hurt my foot . ( she lifts up her foot . It 's wrapped in a piece of ragged scarf ) Raymond bit it . Johnny Ace bit it , Villon bit it , a tarantula bit it . Summer bit it . Kiss it , will ya ' , Slim ? ( SLIM bends down and licks her foot all over . He growls like a coyote and howls . ) SLIM It 's them damn steel plates they put on yer foot when you was a punk . They called ya ' splayfoot , no ' count . I know . I know ' bout them jealous creeps . Lookin ' at my crow like a freak . I 'll kill ' em ! I 'll tear out their throats ! I kiss your foot . I lick your toes . I suck your pinkie ' cause I love ya ' . How 's that for openers ? p. 6 CAVALE Slim , do n't tease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little lobster ? Could ya ' go for a little lobster with drawn butter ? CAVALE I guess . SLIM You do n't dig lobster ? CAVALE Sure . SLIM Who do we call for lobster ? CAVALE Call the lobster man . ( SLIM goes to the phone and dials . Someone answers . ) SLIM Listen , is this the lobster man ? Good . Send us up some lobster with drawn butter and two scrambled eggs and four toasted bialys with cream cheese and some Pepsi-Cola and a bottle of tequila with plenty of lemon . You got that ? Good . ( he hangs up ) CAVALE I 'm not that hungry . SLIM Tell me about Nerval . ( He holds her close and they dance while she talks ; an old waltz or a fox-trot . ) CAVALE Nerval . Hey , Slim , really he 's " de " Nerval , but we 'll can that " de " stuff ' cause it 's too fancy . Hey , Slim , tomorrow can we go into town and you buy me something fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slim , ya ' know what I want ? Tap dance shoes . Red ones , red ones with pretty ribbons . Could we do that , huh , baby ? p. 7 SLIM We 'll do that right now . Right now we 'll do that ! ( He stands up and pulls her to her feet . They take an imaginary walk to the shoe store . CAVALE limps along , SLIM helps her . They walk through the room as though it were the city . ) SLIM Now ya ' got ta look sharp . Ya ' know what I mean . No limpin ' . Try not to limp . CAVALE I ca n't help it , Slim . SLIM I know , I know . Just get it together . It wo n't be far now . Just a little ways . Up past Ridge Avenue , down through Ashland , we 'll slide through Mulberry , and bingo ! We 'll be there . CAVALE It wo n't take long , will it , Slim ? SLIM We 'll be there before you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact ! In fact , you know what ? CAVALE What ? SLIM We 're here . CAVALE Already ? SLIM Yeah . Now just take yer pick . There 's all them pretty dancin ' shoes in the window there . Just take yer pick . CAVALE I want the red ones , Slim . The red ones with the ribbons . SLIM Okay , now I 'm gon na ' break the window , so stand back . p. 8 CAVALE But we got money . SLIM A good thief never hesitates . ( He smashes the window and steals the shoes . They run away to another part of the room and sit down exhausted . SLIM puts a beat-to-shit pair of high-topped sneakers on CAVALE . ) SLIM Now , madam , if you 'll just slip your foot into these , we 'll see how they suit you . ( She tries them on . She takes a walk in them and looks them over . ) CAVALE Oh , Slim , they 're beautiful . SLIM Good , Now will you tell me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name is ? CAVALE Can the " de , " baby . He 's Nerval to me . He had a fucked-up foot too . Poor baby , Always banging into walls . Always dreaming when he 's walkin ' . ( she spins around and tells the story singsong ) It hurts just to think about . Singing , I try to sing it out . Dead in winter . Two calico shirts . They cut the rope , that rope that cut him down . It hurts just to think about or how I 'll do without him . SLIM Cut the shit , baby . You never knew that guy ; he 's a million years old . Just tell the story . CAVALE I do so , I do know him , Slim . He hung himself on my birthday . My birthday . And some lady tole my mom I was made from a hanged man . Poor bastard . And , Slim , he had a crow too . Just like Raymond . I read this dream book Baudelaire writ , and he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-ass . Nah . I 'm just teasing . I 'm sorry , Nerval . Slim , I do n't wan na ' tell this story . It 's stupid . I 'm sick of telling about people killing themselves , it makes me jealous . p. 9 SLIM Okay ! Okay ! Then do n't tell me a story ! Do n't never tell me a story ! Do n't never tell me another fucking story ! See if I care ! Nobody gives a rat 's ass anyway ! I 'm gon na ' play rock-and-roll ! I 'm gon na ' play some mean , shitkickin ' rock-and-roll ! ( He goes to the electric guitar and starts playing loud rock with a lot of feedback . He sings " Have No Fear . " ) SLIM Have no fearThe worst is hereThe worst has comeSo do n't runLet it comeLet is goLet it rock and rollThe worst has come . Have no fearThe best is hereThe best has comeSo do n't runLet it comeLet it goLet it rock and rollThe best has come Every night I sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fearThe worst is hereThe worst has comeSo do n't runLet it comeLet it goLet it rock and rollThe worst has come ( CAVALE plays dead on the floor with Raymond on her stomach . After a while SLIM stops . CAVALE stays " dead . " ) SLIM Hey ! Is that the lobster man ? Hey ! Cavale , did somebody knock ? Cavale ! ( CAVALE stays " dead " on the floor. ) p. 10 SLIM Stupid broad . ( SLIM goes to the door and opens it . The LOBSTER MAN enters . He 's dressed like a lobster and carries all the food they ordered . ) SLIM Oh , you must be the lobster man . Just drop everything in the middle of the floor . ( The LOBSTER MAN grunts , then goes center stage and drops all the food in a heap . ) SLIM Great . Thanks a lot . Just charge that to my office number . Gramercy 6-5489 . Here 's a little something for yourself . ( He tips the LOBSTER MAN . The LOBSTER MAN grunts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lobster man came . Cavale ? You can stop playing dead now . We can eat . Cavale ? Well , I 'm going to eat , I do n't know about you but I 'm going to eat . ( he sits on the floor and digs into the food ) CAVALE I 'm dead , baby . Dead as dogshit . Dead and never baptized . Dead . Slaughtered . Without the Christian aid of water . Water makes me cringe . SLIM Cut the mystical horseshit and come eat . CAVALE ( runs to the food and starts overacting disgustingly ) Oh , man , look at all this neat shit . Have some cream pie , Raymond honey . Slosh up that shit , blackie baby . Shove a little sausage in that ole cracked beak . Here 's tuna in yer eye . p. 11 SLIM I 'm gon na ' roast that fucking crow . ( She tells the story of Raymond as they slop around in the food . ) CAVALE Hey , man . Watch that shit . Raymond 's real sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed with us anymore . SLIM Gim me that sausage . Well , goddammit , it 's sick . Fucking dead crow sucking me off in the morning . You went too far with that one , baby . There 's nothing in my contract says I got ta have a rotting stuffed blackbird for a groupie . CAVALE Hey , shut up , will ya ' ? Raymond 's been a real chum . All them nights in that fuckin ' hospital , all them electric shocks . All those hours they stole my dreams , all those people in white face masks saying I was crazy . Only ole Raymond stuck by me . Never gave me any shit . And the dirty fuckers broke his beak . Poor beak . ( CAVALE bandages Raymond 's beak with an old piece of lace . ) SLIM Poor beak , poor beak , poor beak . All I ever had was a dog . A dog . Like any good American boy . I had a dog . A live dog . A cattle dog . The reason I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He used to chase the cows out of the pasture instead a ' bringin ' ' em for milking . He was a fuckup . CAVALE What was his name ? p. 12 SLIM Blaze . Blaze Storm . Named after the stripper . ( CAVALE sings something like " put the Blame on Mame " in stripper style and picks up the Sears catalogue . ) CAVALE Hey , Slim , I wan na electric dishwasher . SLIM We do n't have any dishes . CAVALE But I want one . I do n't have any housewife shit . I want some stuff ladies have . SLIM You do n't want that shit , you 're not the type . Look , tomorrow I 'll take you into town and buy you a nice calico shirt . Just like your pal Nerval . How 's that , my little rabbit ? CAVALE Fuck Nerval . I wan na dishwasher . I wan na stovepipe and a scrambled-egg maker . Here , Slim , we can get it all in the catalogue . All the stuff you always miss when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Slim . We could even get Raymond a little cradle . And a rattle . And booties . And a black baby lamb with a bell in its tail . SLIM I do n't need no black baby lamb with a bell in its tail and I ai n't gettin ' no cradle for no dead crow . I have a baby ! My own baby ! With its own cradle ! You 've stolen me away from my baby 's cradel ! You 've put a curse on me ! I have a wife and a life of my own ! Why do n't you let me go ! I ai n't no rock-and-roll star . That 's your fantasy . You 've kept me cooped up here for how long has it been now ? I 've lost track of the time . A long time . A long fucking time . And I 'm still not a star ! How do you account for that ? p. 13 CAVALE I do n't know . I never promised nothin ' . SLIM But you led me on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . SLIM Well , it 's true . What am I doing here ? I do n't know who I am anymore . My wife 's left me . She 's gone to Brooklyn with the kid and left me . And here I am stuck with you . CAVALE You can go if you want . SLIM I do n't want ! I do want ! I do n't want ! I want you ! CAVALE Then stay . SLIM I want her too . CAVALE Then go . SLIM Good-bye ! ( SLIM gets up and stomps over to the drums . He starts bashing them violently . CAVALE goes through a million changes . Plays dead . Rebels . Puts on a bunch of feathers and shit to look alluring . Rebels . Motions like she 's gon na bash the amps with a hammer . Hides in a corner . Then , shaping up , she grabs her .45 . SLIM is still slamming . She yells over the drums . ) CAVALE Look , you jive motherfucker , I 'm still packing this pistol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with  --  I 'll  --  Hey , listen to me . I 'm threatening your life . You 're supposed to be scared . Look , baby , kidnapping is a federal affense . It means I 'm a desperate p. 14 SLIM ( still slamming the drums ) It 's " offense , " not " affense . " CAVALE What ? Hey , what do ya ' mean ? SLIM ( stops drumming and sorta slumps over ) I mean your grammar stinks . I mean you talk funny . I mean  --  CAVALE Shit . Goddammit . How could you ? How can you bust up my being a hard bitch with that shit ? What a lousy thing . You know I 'm sensitive about my talking . Shit . Just when I was really getting mean and violent . Murderous . Just like Franois Villon . You fuck it up . You wreck everything . SLIM Cavale ? CAVALE Yeah ? SLIM How come we 're so unhappy ? CAVALE Must be the time of year . SLIM Yeah . It 's that time of year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could change it . CAVALE What ? SLIM The time of year . Let 's change the time of year to Indian summer . That 's my favorite time of year . What 's your favorite time of year ? CAVALE Fall . SLIM Okay , we 'll change the time of year to fall . Okay ? p. 15 CAVALE Okay . SLIM Okay , now it 's fall . Are you happy ? CAVALE Yeah . SLIM Good . Now tell me a story . CAVALE Stop asking me that . I ca n't tell no stories unless I 'm inspired . Who wants to listen to something uninspired ? SLIM Okay , then tell me what it means to be a rock-and-roll star . Tell me that . I 'm supposed to be a rock-and-roll star . You 're going to make me into a rock-and-roll star , right ? CAVALE Right . SLIM So tell me what it means , so I 'll have something to go by . CAVALE Well , it 's hard , Slim . I 'll try to tell you but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish around for the right way to tell ya ' . I always felt the rhythm of what it means but I never translated it to words . Here , hold Raymond . Come on . It 's like , well , the highest form of anything is sainthood . A marvelous thief like Villon or Genet they were saints ' cause they raised thievery to its highest state of grace . Ole George Carter , black and beat to shit on some dock singing " Rising River Blues " he was one . He sang like an ole broke-down music box . Some say Jesse James was one and me I dream of being one . But I ca n't . I mean I ca n't be the saint people dream of now . People want a street angel . They want a saint but with a cowboy mouth . Somebody to get off on when they ca n't get off on themselves . I think that 's what Mick Jagger is trying to do what Bob Dylan seemed to be for a while . A sort of god in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he got too conscious . For a while he gave me hope but he misses . He 's not whole . Hey Slim am I losing ya ' ? I mean , just tell me if I 'm getting draggy . It 's just hard and it 's real important . p. 16 SLIM No , baby , it 's beautiful . CAVALE Well , I want it to be perfect , ' cause it 's the only religion I got . It 's like well , in the old days people had Jesus and those guys to embrace they created a god with all their belief energies and when they did n't dig themselves they could lose themselves in the Lord . But it 's too hard now . We 're earthy people , and the old saints just do n't make it , and the old God is just too far away . He do n't represent our pain no more . His words do n't shake through us no more . Any great motherfucker rock-'n ' - roll song can raise me higher than all of Revelations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's our child a child that 's got ta burst in the mouth of a savior . Mick Jagger would love to be that savior but it ai n't him . It 's like the rock-'n ' - roll star in his highest state of grace will be the new savior rocking to Bethlehem to be born . Ya ' know what I mean , Slim ? SLIM Well , fuck it , man . I ai n't no savior . CAVALE But you 've got it . You 've got the magic . You could do it . You could be it . SLIM How ? CAVALE You got ta collect it . You got ta reach out and grab all the little broken , busted-up pieces of people 's frustration . That stuff in them that 's lookin ' for a way out or a way in . You know what I mean ? The stuff in them that makes them wan na ' see God 's face . And then you got ta take all that into yourself and pour it back out . Give it back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Slim . Like God was selfish , He kept Himself hid . He was n't a performer . You 're a performer , man . You got ta be like a rock-and-roll Jesus with a cowboy mouth . p. 17 SLIM You fucking cunt ! ( He jumps up and starts tearing the place apart , throwing things against the walls and screaming his head off . ) SLIM You stupid fucking cunt ! Two years ago or one year ago ! If it was then ! If this was happening to me then , I could 've done it ! I could 've done it ! But not now ! Not fucking now ! I got another life ! I ca n't do it now ! It 's too late ! You ca n't bring somebody 's dream up to the surface like that ! It ai n't fair ! It ai n't fucking fair ! I know I could do it , but you 're not supposed to tempt me ! You 're twisting me up ! You 're tearing me inside out ! Get out of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAVALE This ai n't your house . This is my house . SLIM It 's nobody 's house . Nobody 's house . ( He collapses , exhausted from his violence . CAVALE goes to him as if to soothe him , then realizes it 's her dream being busted and not his . She starts yelling at him while he just lies there wiped out . ) CAVALE You 're fucking right  --  nobody 's house . A little nobody with a big fucking dream . Her only dream . My only dream . I spread my dreams at your feet , everything I believe in , and you tread all over them with your simpy horseshit . Fuck you . Fuck you . Poor , poor baby . I take your world and shake it . Well , you took my fantasy and shit on it . I was doing the streets looking for a man with nothing so I could give him everything . Everything it takes to make the world reel like a drunkard . But you have less than nothing , baby , you have part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's settled I ca n't do nothing to alter it . I ca n't do shit . I ca n't give you nothing . I ca n't . I ca n't . You wo n't let me. p. 18 SLIM Come here . ( He pulls her to him . They hug each other . A pause . They lie on the bed . ) SLIM Listen to the traffic . It sounds like a river . I love rivers . I love the way they just go wherever they want . If they get too full they just overflow and flow wherever they want . They make up their own paths . New Paths . I tried to make a dam once in a river . It was just a little river . I put a whole bunch a ' rocks and sticks and shit in that river . I even put a tree in that river , but I could n't get it to stop . I kept coming back day after day putting more and more rocks and mud and sticks in to try to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dammed it up . Just a little trickle coming out and a big pool started to form . I was really proud . I 'd stopped a river . So I went back home and got in bed and thought about what a neat thing I 'd done . Then it started to rain . It rained really hard . All night long it rained . The next morning I ran down to the river , and my dam was all busted to shit . That river was raging like a brush fire . Just gushing all over the place . Gushing up over the sides and raging right into the woods . I never built another dam again . CAVALE You 're so neat . You 're such a neat guy . I wish I woulda ' known you when I was little . Not real little . But at the age when you start finding out stuff . When I was cracking rocks apart and looking at their sparkles inside . When I first put my finger inside me and felt wonderment . I would 've took you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfall with tires and shit , and my own hut . We could 've taken all our clothes off , and I 'd look at your dinger , and you could show me how far you could piss . I bet you would 've protected me . People were always giving me shit . Ya ' know what ? Once I was in a play . I was real glad I was in a play ' cause I thought they were just for pretty people , and I had my dumb eyepatch and those metal plate shoes to correct my duck foot . It was The Ugly Ducking , and I really dug that ' cause of the happy ending and shit . And I got to be the ugly duckling and I had to wear some old tattered black cloth and get shit flung at me , but I did n't mind ' cause at the end I 'd be that pretty swan and all . But you know what they did , Slim ? At the end of the play I had to kneel on the stage and cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blonde-haired girl dressed in a white ballet dress rose up behind me as the swan . It was really shitty , man . I never got to be the fucking swan . I paid all the dues and up rose ballerina Cathy like the North Star . And afterwards all the parents could talk about was how pretty she looked . Boy , I ran to my hideout and cried and cried . The lousy fucks . I wish you were around then . I bet you would 've protected me. p. 19 SLIM Poor baby . ( pause ) Well , what 're we gon na ' do now ? CAVALE We could howl at the moon . SLIM Okay . Ready ? ( They both let out howls , then laugh and fall on the floor . They play the coyote and the crow game on their hands and knees . SLIM talks in an old cracked , lecherous voice . ) SLIM Now , the coyote is mean . He 's lean and low-down . He do n't fool around with no scraggly crows . When he sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He growls and goes after CAVALE . She scurries away . ) CAVALE Little crow did n't do nothin ' . Jes ' out here peckin ' in the desert . Checkin ' out the sand for little corn grains . Jes ' a little somepin ' to nibble . SLIM Coyote gettin ' hungry ' bout now . He ai n't seen a chicken for he do n't know how long . Crow look pretty good at this point . He do n't care if it be fat and saucy . Just a little somepin ' ta tear the wings off of . CAVALE Without no wings little crow bait have a hard time singin ' . Starts to run all crazy through the night . SLIM Coyote he howl and chomp down on that crow now . Tear into that crow now ! ( He jumps on CAVALE and tears into her . They roll around on the floor for a while , then stop. ) p. 20 SLIM Now coyote full . He ate up his tidbit . Now he roll on his back and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cactus bush . CAVALE Little crow feel pretty good inside coyote belly . Not bad she says for a day on the range . Not bad at all . Though she may never see daylight again . Not bad at all . ( A pause . ) SLIM Now what 'll we do ? CAVALE I do n't know . SLIM We could call back the lobster man just for laughs . CAVALE Okay . Let me do it , okay ? SLIM Sure . CAVALE Goody. ( she runs to the telephone and picks it up ) Hello . Is this the lobster man ? It is ? Could you come back over here again ? We need some cheering up . You would ? Oh great ! Thanks a lot . Bye . ( she hangs up ) He 's coming right over . SLIM Good . CAVALE Let 's play a trick on him when he comes , okay ? SLIM Like what ? CAVALE I do n't know . SLIM What could we do ? p. 21 CAVALE Too bad he is n't a tuna fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put him in it . SLIM Let 's just talk to him when he comes . CAVALE What about ? SLIM About what it 's like to be a lobster man . It must be pretty weired , you know . Weirder than being us . CAVALE We 're not weird , man . He 's weird , but we 're not weird . SLIM We could ask what the bottom of the ocean is like . CAVALE We could put him in a movie . SLIM What movie ? CAVALE Three Coins in the Fountain . The Prophet . SLIM The Swimmer . CAVALE You 're Just My Little Chicken of the Sea . SLIM No , we got ta be nice to him . He 's had a hard life . CAVALE How do you know ? SLIM You can tell by his claws . He 's got barnacles on his claws . CAVALE That means he 's a wily old devil . He 's outfoxed all the fishermen for years and years . He 's never been caught . SLIM That 's why he 's so big . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never be boiled , that one . SLIM We could boil him . CAVALE I thought you wanted to be nice to him . SLIM Did you ever hear a lobster scream when they hit the boiling water ? It 's awful . It 's like a peacock fucking . CAVALE We ca n't boil him . We do n't have any dishes . SLIM I could stab him with my switchblade. ( he pulls out a giant switchblade and stabs it into the floor ) CAVALE Now , dear , do n't get violent . Our company 's arriving any minute now . SLIM I could cut through that hard shell and tear his heart out . I could eat his heart . You know that 's what warriors used to do . Primitive warriors . They 'd kill their opponent and then tear his heart out and eat it . Only if they fought bravely , though . Because then they believed they 'd captured the opponent 's strength . CAVALE What kind of strength does a lobster have ? SLIM Ancient strength . Strength of the ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobster so much . They 're very prehistoric . CAVALE But this one 's a monster . p. 23 SLIM You 'd say the same thing about a Tyrannosaurus if he came in the door . I suppose you 'd call him a monster too . ( Loud banging on the door . ) CAVALE Jiggers , it 's the lobster man ! Quick , put away that knife . We do n't want to scare him off . ( SLIM folds up his knife and puts it away . ) CAVALE Okay . Ready ? SLIM Ready . ( More loud banging . ) CAVALE Coming ! ( She goes to the door and opens it . LOBSTER MAN enters . ) CAVALE Oh , Mr. Lobster Man . We 're so happy to see you . We were just talking about you . Wo n't you come in ? ( LOBSTER MAN saunters to center stage and grunts . He looks ill at ease in the situation . ) SLIM Have a seat . ( LOBSTER MAN sits on the bed and stares out at the audience . SLIM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you been a lobster ? ( LOBSTER MAN grunts . ) SLIM What 'd he say ? CAVALE He does n't speak too clear . Could you try to speak up so we can understand you ? ( LOBSTER MAN grunts. ) p. 24 SLIM Listen , the little lady here and I were discussing how we 'd like to get to know you on a more intimate level . You know what I mean ? I mean it 's a drag to have servants just bringin ' ya ' shit up the stairs and throwin ' it down in the middle of the floor and then leavin ' and you never get a chance to know them on a more intimate level . You know what I mean ? ( LOBSTER MAN grunts . ) CAVALE Yeah , you must be a very interesting person , and we do n't even know you . That 's not fair . We 'd like to know your darkest nightmares , your most beautiful dreams , your wildest fantasies , your hopes , your aspirations . Stuff like that . SLIM What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we ought a try a different tactic . SLIM Like what ? CAVALE Like just ignoring him for a while . Pretend like he 's not here . I mean , how would you feel if you walked into a situation like this ? SLIM I never would . CAVALE I know , but just pretend you did . Let 's just ignore him for a while . SLIM The whole point in bringing him over was so that we 'd have something to do . p. 25 CAVALE I know , but it ai n't workin ' out . SLIM So what 're we gon na ' do then ? CAVALE Let 's go down to the deli and leave him here alone . SLIM He might rip us off . CAVALE So what ? We do n't need this shit . SLIM What about my drums ? My guitar ? CAVALE What about them ? Man , you knock me out . You just gave it to me on the line . And like the Chinese say , sweetie , fuck the dream , you fuck the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ace . It 's the Aquarian Age . Ya ' know it was predicted that when Christ came back he 'd come as a monster . And the lobster man ai n't no James Dean . Hey , honey , hit some hot licks on the Fender . We 're going out for a little shrimp cocktail . SLIM " Now what rough beast slouches toward Bethlehem to be born ? " So now you want him to take my place . Is that it ? You think this creep is gon na ' take me over ! Is that it ! You 're gon na ' pour your magic gris-gris into this fool ! Well , I 'm gon na ' cut his ass wide open ! ( He pulls out his switchblade again and starts to threaten the LOBSTER MAN . ) CAVALE Slim ! Cut the shit ! He 's only a poor old lobster . Leave him alone . p. 26 SLIM ( to LOBSTER MAN ) Pretty sneaky . Pretty fuckin ' sneaky . Squirmin ' yer way into our lives . Pretendin ' dumb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's goin ' on . You 've got the silver . You 've got the gold . Out with it ! Out with it , Lobster Man , or the sun wo n't shine on your slimy shell . CAVALE No , do n't , Slim . Leave him alone . He did n't do nothin ' . Leave my savior alone . SLIM Your savior ? Your savior ! He 's supposed to be your savior ? Okay , we 'll just see what kinda ' stuff he 's made of then . We 'll just play him a little music and see what makes him tick . All right , Lobster Man , this is your big chance . ( SLIM goes to the guitar and starts playing the old C-A minor-F-G chords as CAVALE soothes the LOBSTER MAN . ) CAVALE All right now , this wo n't hurt . Do n't be afraid . I 'll be right back . Okay ? ( CAVALE gets up and goes to the microphone . She begins to talk the song " Loose Ends " as SLIM plays behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the song , the LOBSTER MAN gets up from the bed and comes downstage . As the song unfolds he begins to break open and crack , revealing the rock-and-roll savior inside the shell , dressed in black . ) CAVALE I 'm at loose endsI do n't know what to doAlways dreaming big dreamsHalf dreamsWanting him and loving youTo tell the truth I do n't know which way to turnGive me something to hold on toSomething I can learnOh come right here Come right here when you feel aloneAnd no one speaks for you You can do it on your own Show me the way to it You know I need a friendA song to pull me from the hole I 'm inGive me something low-downGive me something highPulling in the power of dark or lightTo destroy to the leftCreate on the rightOh come right here Come right here it 's such a simple songIt 'll cure all your misery It wo n't move you wrongSo open up your mouth do n't think about a thingFeel the movement in you and sing Sing sing sing sing ( CAVALE sings this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to doI needed to open upSo I turned to you ( She talks . ) Help me to do itI was always dreaming too highHelp me pull my star down from the skyDown on the groundWhere I can feel itWhere I can touch itWhere I can be it Oh I do n't want to give upI believe a light still shinesIt shines for everyoneIt 's yoursIt 's mineOh come right here ( CAVALE talks the chorus , SLIM sings . They alternate lines . ) Come right here you know you 're not aloneIf you got no savior you can do it on your ownOpen up your heart do n't think about a thingFeel the movement in you and sing ( By the end of the song the LOBSTER MAN is completely out of his shell and stands center stage as the rock-roll savior . He stares out at the audience . SLIM sets down his guitar and goes to the gun . He picks up the gun and goes to the LOBSTER MAN . He holds out the gun for the LOBSTER MAN to take . The LOBSTER MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOBSTER MAN , then crosses to the door . He pauses a moment and turns to look at CAVALE . They stare at each other for a moment . Then SLIM exits through the door . CAVALE turns to the LOBSTER MAN and gives her speech very simply and softly , sitting on the edge of the stage . As she talks , the LOBSTER MAN spins the chamber of the gun , almost in rhythm with the speech . All through this he stares at the audience. ) p. 27 CAVALE Nerval . He had visions . He cried like a coyote . He carried a crow . He walked through the Boulevard Noir inhuman like a triangle . He had a pet lobster on a pink ribbon . He told it his dreams , his visions , all the great secrets to the end of the world . And he hung himself on my birthday . Screaming like a coyote . The moon was cold and full and his visions and the crow and the lobster went on cavale . That 's where I found my name . Cavale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As CAVALE finishes , the LOBSTER MAN slowly raises the pistol to his head and squeezes the trigger . A loud click as the hammer strikes an empty chamber . The lights slowly fade to black. )
