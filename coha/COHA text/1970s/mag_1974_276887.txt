" We 've got problems with that fellow ... uh ... uh ... " " Jaworski ? " " Yes . " <P> Telephoning Martha Mitchell-style from seclusion in San Clemente , Richard Nixon could perhaps be excused a mental block in failing to remember the name of Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski . As related by the recipient of the call , Republican Congressman Dan Kuykendall of Tennessee , Nixon thanked him for his longtime support and seemed concerned about his own future . " Do you think the people are going to want to pick the carcass ? " asked the former President . <P> The metaphor was just as grisly but no more apt than Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott 's claim that Nixon had been " hung " and need not be " drawn and quartered . " The plain fact is that the former President 's own tapes provide prima-facie evidence that he was a participant in the Watergate cover-up conspiracy for which his aides have been charged with crimes . It is on that basis that Nixon does indeed have " problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it is highly unlikely that Nixon will be charged with a crime until after the conspiracy trial of six of his former aides at least gets under way and its jury is sequestered . To indict Nixon before then and make him a defendant in the same trial would require a long delay while he prepared his defense . To indict him and seek a separate trial would generate new publicity that would make the selection of a jury for the trial of the others extremely difficult . <P> The way was apparently cleared last week for the conspiracy trial to begin on Sept. 30 . The appeal of one of the defendants , John Ehrlichman , for a longer delay was turned down by Chief Justice Warren Burger of the Supreme Court . At the moment , Nixon is scheduled to be a witness at that trial , since a subpoena from Ehrlichman 's lawyers was finally served privately on Nixon at San Clemente by a U.S. marshal . What action Nixon will take , if any , to avoid that appearance undoubtedly will be one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Herbert John ( Jack ) Miller Jr . The Washington firm Miller , Cassidy , Larroca &; LeVin accepted the task after at least one , and possibly three law firms rejected overtures to defend Nixon . <P> Pun-Loving . Miller , 50 , brings unique qualifications to his Nixon defense role . A Republican who campaigned for Robert Kennedy in his 1968 presidential primary drive , Miller had served as chief of the Justice Department 's Criminal Division when Kennedy was Attorney General . There he became acquainted with many members of the present Jaworski staff , including James Neal , who will head the prosecution team in the conspiracy trial . A frequent guest at Kennedy 's Hickory Hill estate , the gregarious , pun-loving Miller retained his Republican credentials by running , unsuccessfully , for Lieutenant Governor of Maryland in 1970 . He was among the personal advisers summoned by Senator Edward Kennedy to Hyannis Port after the Senator 's 1969 accident at Chappaquiddick.
