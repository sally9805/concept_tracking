The 200th anniversary of the birth of the United States of America is still four years away , but already the celebrations and national self-inspections are beginning-cultural as well as political . Last week in Washington , one of the first and most promising took form on the stage of the Kennedy Center 's Concert Hall : a panoramic view of the U.S. 's musical past . The performers were the Paul Hill Chorale , a lively fixture on the capital scene . Called The Music Has Always Been There , their program was both a sonic trip into bygone times and an entrancing prelude to a projected series of concerts stretching into 1976 . <P> Conductor Hill began the evening with his most startling novelty : The Star-Spangled Banner in its earliest published version ( 1814 ) . The first edition turned out to have occasional variations in notation from the version in use today , betraying even more clearly the song 's derivation from an 18th century hit tune called To Anacreon In Heaven . At the same time , as sung by the Hill Chorale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested the effect the song may have had on those who heard it first . <P> There were more curiosities to come : Spiritual Music from New England tune books of the late 18th century , richly melancholy Negro spirituals , then a leap to Charles Ives ' quirky but equally spiritual Three Harvest Home Chorales-still sounding sonorously dissonant and as futuristic as ever . <P> For Worldly Music , Hill presented 15 campaign songs from forgotten elections , many of them set to popular tunes of their day : " Oh dear , what can the matter be ? /Women are wanting to vote ! " ; a rollicking boast of " Hoorah , hoorah , the country 's risin ' / For Henry Clay and Frelinghuysen " to the tune of Old Dan Tucker ; and a plaintive complaint about Prohibition with Old Black Joe 's lyrics changed to " I 'm thirsty , I 'm thirsty/For the beer we used to know. /I hear the gentle voices cal-ling , /'Have one , Joe . ' " The truly grand finale featured excerpts from March King John Philip Sousa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then vanished into obscurity , leaving only the famous title march to mark its existence . <P> Future programs , like last week 's , will be underwritten by private foundations and the National Endowment for the Arts and researched by Music Historian Vera Brodsky Lawrence , whose mania for musical Americana has resulted in the publication of the complete music of Louis Moreau Gottschalk and of Ragtime Composer Scott Joplin ( TIME , Feb. 7 ) . With such continued aid and support , says Hill , " we want to do a dozen or more programs like this one . Even that would barely scratch the surface . "
