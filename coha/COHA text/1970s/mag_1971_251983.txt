DAN COGGIN has spent most of the past seven years observing turmoil in Asia-grim but invaluable experience for his latest assignment , this week 's cover story on Pakistan . A former Marine , Coggin witnessed the Indonesian crisis of the mid- ' 60s , went next to South Viet Nam and then served as New Delhi bureau chief . Assigned to the Beirut bureau last fall , he continues to contribute his expertise on Pakistan . He was one of the 35 newsmen expelled from Dacca on March 26 , but in April he trekked from India by oxcart , rowboat , motorcycle , bicycle and bus to become the first American journalist to get back to the Eastern capital . He returned again for this week 's story and , despite his having seen much war in the past , found that " this one has special horrors . " <P> The two other correspondents contributing to the cover story are also veteran observers of Asian fighting . James Shepherd , an Indian national , joined TIME 'S New Delhi bureau in 1958 . His assignments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indo-Pakistani war waged over Kashmir . Recently Shepherd toured the refugee camps that line the Indo-East Pakistani border . David Greenway , whose most recent beat was the United Nations , formerly served in the Saigon and Bangkok bureaus . Last week he visited the insurgent forces . " The countryside , " he says , " looks quite like Viet Nam , and with all the airpower , armor and artillery the rebels face , it must have been like visiting the Viet Cong in the early days of that other war . " <P> <P> Our essay this week deals with imaginary numbers , those intriguing but often inadequately supported figures that festoon our data-happy society . Like other publications , TIME sometimes finds it impossible to avoid using such numbers . They are accurate as far as anyone knows , but inevitably they represent estimates rather than precise measurements . In the current issue , the cover story quantifies East Pakistan 's essentially unmeasurable agony in several ways ( more than 7,000,000 refugees fled to India , for example ) . Elsewhere we note that U.S. crops are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( ENVIRONMENT ) , and that microorganisms once killed 100 million pounds of fish in Florida ( THE NATION ) , confident that these figures represent at least reliable approximations . As a result of the Essay , continued watchfulness about imaginary figures will be pledged by nearly 200 TIME editors , writers , reporter-researchers and correspondents . At least that is our estimate .
