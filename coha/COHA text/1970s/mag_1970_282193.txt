John A. Volpe must enjoy confounding his critics . A millionaire highway builder and former Republican Governor of Massachusetts , he was expected to pave over America when he became Richard Nixon 's Secretary of Transportation . Instead , Volpe has stopped highway projects that would have thrust through park land and destroyed low-income housing and historic buildings . Says he : " We 've got to provide a national transportation system with the least possible harm to the environment . " <P> This week , when Volpe presents the Highway Act of 1970 to the House Public Works Committee , he plans to go even farther . He proposes to open the hitherto untouchable-indeed , almost sacrosanct-Federal Highway Trust Fund to purposes other than building roads . By so doing , Volpe will antagonize the highway lobby , a powerful amalgam of contractors , oilmen , billboard companies , automakers and others . The fight of his political life appears imminent . <P> Idealistic Lobbyist . The fund takes in about $5.5 billion a year , mostly from a 4 levy on every gallon of gas purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started , this money has automatically gone directly into building more and more interstate highways-about 30,000 miles ' worth to date . Now Volpe wants to broaden the uses of the fund to include such nonconstruction projects as driver-education and billboard removal for beautification . <P> Catalyst for Volpe 's startling proposal was Douglas T. Snarr , the most active exponent of the Highway Beautification Act of 1965 . To obey the law , Snarr , who himself owns 1,300 outdoor signs in the Rocky Mountain area , last year became a one-man lobby against billboards ( TIME , Oct. 31 ) . Although the Senate approved a measure in November to pay billboard owners to remove their own signs , Snarr 's crusade had hardly begun . Idealistic , insistent , resplendent in purple suits and iguana cowboy boots , Snarr seized every chance to plead his cause . This winter , he astonished politicians by convincing John A. Volpe to act . <P> Billboard Blight . Wheels within wheels began to turn . Volpe swayed a reluctant Bureau of Public Roads to attack billboard blight . White House staffers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their approval . Then Illinois Representative John C. Kluczynski , chairman of the House Subcommittee on Roads , insisted that a highway-safety program be started too . But where would the money come from ? Everybody thought of the Highway Trust Fund . <P> In quick order , the Budget Bureau and Justice and Treasury Departments approved the idea of opening the fund 's bulging coffers . The changes in the flow of money from the fund amount to only $120 million in fiscal 1972 , or about 2% of its total . But if the program is approved by Congress , which appears likely , some environmentalists hope for more far-reaching changes . For one , the fund conceivably could finance development of new , cheaper , faster and pollution-free means of transportation . By cracking the trust fund , the Nixon Administration may be taking its biggest step to improve the U.S. environment .
