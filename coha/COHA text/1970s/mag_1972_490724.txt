THE TALK OF THE TOWN ' Votes and Comment THE Department of Defense , not because its leaders wished to do so but because they were apprehensive about the political consequences of not doing so , has decided to withdraw from Vietnam its stockpile of a million and a half gallons of the defoliant Agent Orange  --  consisting of an equal mixture of the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T which it was about to hand over to the South Vietnamese authorities last fall to spray on their own countryside and people . As far back as 1966 ? when the Americans had already been waging herbicidal warfare in Vietnam for five years  --  samples of 2,4,5-T studied under government contract by Bionetics Research Laboratories , of Bethesda , Maryland , were shown to exert teratogenic , or fetus-deforming , effects on experimental animals . But it was not until about two years ago  --  after protracted delays , successive evasive maneuvers , and downright distortion of the facts by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Defense , and even the concealment of important data about the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon that pressure , resulting from a Senate subcommittee investigation headed by Senator Philip Hart , obliged the Administration to place restrictions nr prohibitions on certain uses of 2,4,5-T in this country . Since then , the herbicide has been shown to he inevitably contaminated with a dioxin known as TCDD , one of the most toxic substances known to man ; even in as purified a form as science has been able to achieve , 2,4,5-T , in large doses , has been shown to have teratogenic effects on experimental animals . Confronted with these facts , the Department of Defense , in 1970 , was forced to suspend its use in defoliation operations in Vietnam . As late as this past August , however , the Department was attempting to propagate the fiction that although the American military had stopped its own use of 2,4,5-T in Vietnam , it had no power to prevent the South Vietnamese authorities from using the million and a half gallons of Agent Orange remaining in Vietnam as they saw fit in defoliation operations conducted by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental groups in this country who are aware of the damage the use of this defoliant in Vietnam has already done , has now made it too difficult for the Department of Defense to hand over the stocks of 2,4,5-T under the subterfuge that it no longer owns the stuff . Currently , the United States Air Force , after considering various alternatives for the disposal of its stockpiles of Agent Orange in this country and in Vietnam  --  one was to sell the herbicide to some foreign country  --  has made tentative plans to attempt to render the stockpiles harmless by burning them in a commercial incineration plant here , with preference apparently given to a plant , with a smokestack a hundred feet high , that occupies a two-hundred-acre site just southeast of Houston . The amount of Agent Orange to be brought hack here from Vietnam and the stockpiles of Agent Orange already in this country total 2,338,900 gallons . The Air Force plan calls for the burning of the herbicide at the rate of five thousand gallons a day for four hundred and sixty-eight days , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hydrochloric acid and carbon dioxide , going on day and night . The drums in which the herbicide is now stored would , according to this plan , be flushed with an alkaline detergent solution , then mechanically crushed , and buried in a deep pit . An Air Force report estimates that the temperatures involved in the incineration process would dc-compose the herbicide and its dioxin contaminant , but in order to make sure that this decomposition would indeed take place the Air Force proposes to study the problem with the Department of Agriculture . However , since the Department of Agriculture has consistently argued in the past that 2,4,5-T , potent contaminant and all , is innocuous and benign , one can hardly feel sanguine about the reliability of whatever assurances the Department of Agriculture and the Air Force may come up with as a result of their joint study . While agencies of the United States government are pondering the best ways of rendering the remaining stocks of Agent Orange harmless , others can ponder what the American military has wrought so far in its program of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has sprayed or dumped upon the Vietnamese countryside and the Vietnamese people approximately fifty thousand tons of herbicides . In order to hurt the Vietcong and to turn inhabitants of Vietcong-controlled areas into refugees , it has carried on a huge campaign of crop destruction , but that is not all . In the course of the herbicidal warfare in Vietnam , the Americans have defoliated a seventh of the land , ruined a large part of the timber resources that in the postwar period would have to he considered South Vietnam 's principal potential export , and caused other grave ecological damage , some of which  --  like the infestation of certain defoliated areas by ineradicable bamboo  --  can not he reversed for many generations . All this has been carried out to the accompanirnent of repeated claims the American military , and by the State . Department as well , that the herbicides used are " not dangerous to man or animal life . " A couple of years ago , a spokesman for the Department of Defense claimed as one of the benefits of the defoliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on the defoliated hardwoods and could sell the resultant charcoal in the Vietnamese towns . The Air Force now appears to be happy that it has found a hundred-foot tower in this country to carry off the combustion products of the herbicide , with its potent dioxin . But the Vietnamese people have no such towers . Many Vietnamese women cook family meals over charcoal obtained from trees killed by the 2,4,5-T herbicidal spray . If the charcoal these women use still contains traces of the dioxin contaminant  --  or if , as some scientists have reported , the burning of 2,4,5-T can itself produce dioxin they arc running a risk of ingesting quantities , though small , of one of the most poisonous and teratogenic substances known . As long ago as 1967 , a confidential memorandum from an American official connected with the herbicidal program in Vietnam reported that " no American program is more bitterly resented by the Vietnamese peasant than defoliation and crop-destruction opprations . " And now the Vietnamese people may he breathing the results of this American folly . It would he unwise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orange to this country means the end of herbicidal warfare in Vietnam . The American military provided the South Vietnamese authorities with several hundred thousand gallons of two additional herbicidal agents it has been using in Vietnam . They are Agent White , which is a mixture of 2,4-D and picloram ( the latter is the most persistent of all herbicides ) , and Agent Blue , which is fifty-three per cent arsenic . Now these agents are being sprayed around fire bases and on the Vietnamese countryside by the South Vietnamese military . When will this destruction be brought to an end ? Has n't fifty thousand tons of herbicide been enough ? We think that the proposed withdrawal , at last , of the remaining stocks of Agent Orange from Vietnam , having in effect knocked the props out from under the rationalizations of the American military about the harmlessness and humaneness of herbicidal warfare , should enable the United States Senate to ratify the Geneva Protocol of 1925 , outlawing chemical and biological warfare . The Geneva Protocol has not been ratified by the United States , partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized nations who have expressed themselves on the question , is unwilling to recognize herbicidal warfare as one of the forms of warfare that the Protocol was intended to outlaw fo re ve r . Towin u s-r week , Our Town  --  badly put down of late by upstaters  --  was a sanctuary for about nine hundred of the nine hundred and thirty-one small towns in the state . From Monday to Wednesday , more than three thousand elected or appointed town officials took over the New York Hilton and the Americana Hotel to pick up tips from one another  --  and also from some New York City officials  --  on how to do a better job of running their towns . It was the fortieth meeting of the Association of Towns of the State of New York , which has its headquarters in Albany , and which exists , in the words of its annual report , " to provide the officers of member towns with the information they need to perform properly their official duties . " To explain the choice of New York City as the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only town in the state that can comfortably hold all the other towns at one time . And , according to another official , it is the best place " to have a little fun on the side . " We learned all this last Tuesday afternoon at the Hilton , as we moved among delegates from towns like Aurora , Colonic , Watson , Austerlitz , Fabius , Kinderhook , Guilderland , Pittsford , Monroe , Otego , Oneonta , Hartland , Irondequoit , Norwich , Guildford , Vestal , Pomfret , Ramapo , Southold , and Tonawanda most of which , we must say , we had n't heard of before . The majority of the delegates proved to be town supervisors , but there was a healthy sprinkling of assessors , town clerks , town hoard men , constables , town historians , town justices , collectors , fire officers , and highway superintendents . At the Hilton , they were rushing between suites and ballrooms , on their way to and from clinics and seminars that , we saw in our program for the three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hearings , " " Snowmobiles , " " How to Be an Ethical Historian , " " Meeting the Public , " " The Small Rural Type Food Market and Gas Station , " " Collector 's Cash Book , " " Review of Questionnaires on Dog Law Matters , " " Cable Televisi ) n Regulation Today , " " Sand and Gravel Mining , " " Roadside Vegetation , " " Special Districts : Accounting Pr iblems , " and " Planning a Town 's Growth . " We stopped a plump , gray-haired middle-aged man hurrying out of the Georgian Ballroom , where the clinic on " Meeting the Public " had just broken up . He carried a heavy-looking briefcase and wore a rumpled blue suit ; his tie , which was gray , was loose at the collar of a gray-striped red shirt ; he looked tired , and a tag on one lapel said his name was Emmett Sullivan . He told us that he was the town supervisor of Hartland . " You 'll find us in Niagara County , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess . In 1970 , our population was forty-one hundred and sixty . Still , we are bigger than a lot of towns . Why , you 'll find that a lot of the towns that are here today have no more than five hundred people , and sometimes as few as one hundred . I 've been a Hartland man all my life  --  was born there . Matter of fact , all my folks , going back more than a hundred years , were born there . " We asked him to tell us a little about his job . " Well , as town supervisor , I 'm the chief elected officer , " he said , resting his briefcase on the floor . " r chair the town-hoard meeting once a month , represent my town on the Niagara County Water Authority , keep the records of our income and disbu rsements , manage the hooks , pay all the salaries and hills , and recommend the appointment of zoning officers , at-torneys , and members of the planning hoard , the youth committee , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded like a tall order , and that we hoped we would n't embarrass him if we asked about his salary . He smiled , and said , " I 'm waiting to tell you . Twenty-seven hundred a year . It 's really a part-time job . I do n't know any supervisor who can live off what he gets . My wife helps me keep the town books , while I go out and work as a building contractor . That 's true of most supervisors . I know one who works part-time doing what I do . I know another who has a dairy farm with eighty head of purebred Holsteins . But if you 're not dedicated there 's no sense in running for a job like supervisor . There 's no money in it . " A few minutes later , we stopped in at the Sutton Ballroom , where about four hundred delegates were attending ? ? the annual business meeting . They did not completely fill the room , and we asked the delegate we sat beside why there were still so many empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " They have to go out on the town . When your town sends you here to represent it , you 're on your own . There 's no one to check up on what you 're doing . " As the meeting went on , however , and we heard a little more of what the Association of Towns was all about , we were struck by its solidarity . It was n't just that the " ave " s carried every discussion ; there was a conspicuous absence of " no " s . We could n't remember when we had last witnessed such a display of unanimity in the City of New York . We heard one note of dissent , but it lacked the energy or the courage to grow into a " no . " When the chairman presented the slate of new officers  --  one candidate per office  --  for approval , a delegate who must have been attending his first Association annual meeting rose to ask why the delegates were not presented with a choice of candidates . The chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been handled " in this Association , " and the delegate said nothing more . As for what troubled the towns , three of the resolutions that were read on the platform seemed informative . One deplored the proposed take-over by New York State of the counties ' sales-taxing powers , on the ground that the counties not only needed the sales tax for themselves but were already overtaxed by the state government . Another demanded that the Telephone Company extend to small towns the preferential rates granted to cities and villages . And the third protested a tendency of county legislatures to pass laws that usurped the legislative powers of the town boards . One delegate was not quite clear about what the last resolution covered , and asked for an example . " For instance , a town may well decide that eight-foot fence poles around swimming pools are high enough , " the chairman explained . " But then the county legislature rules that all poles around swimming pools must he ten feet high . Well , that 's none of their affair . They ca n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Family Store ABRAND-NEW , windowless , **39;4151;TOOLONG am-slate-panelled monument of a department store , with fourteen levels ( twelve aboveground and two below ) , totalling four hundred and twenty-five thousand square feet of floor space , was being filled , carton by carton , with brand-new mattresses , towels , lamps , Keds , jumping jacks , Italian dinnerware , Japanese dinnerware , Wedgwood china , jars of cleansing cream , tins of fried herrings in mushroom-flavored sauce , boxes of super-eyelashes , toys , nightgowns , bathrobes , coats , pants , sofas , Wassily chairs , Eames chairs , buttons , perfumes , ties , pocketbooks , bathing suits , jewelry , clocks , curtains , flags , pool tables , umbrellas , candles , shoes  --  things , things , things .

We saw all this , and more , last week at Gimbels East  --  the second Gimbels in the city  --  on the northwest corner of Eighty-sixth Street and Lexington Avenue , as it was being made ready for its official opening , on February 24th . " If it 's new , if it 's going to be great , we 're going to have it , " said Margot Infantino , a friendly , attractive , strong-willed woman , who is public-relations manager for the Gimbels New York division . She had invited us in for a look , and there was no doubt about the way she felt about Gimbels . " This is the first time a store has been built to serve the needs of an area in Manhattan , " she told us . " This is the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores in Manhattan . This is a very contemporary store . We 've even got a teeny little cocktail lounge . Very intime . " " Is there a Mr. Gimbel around ? " we asked as Miss Infantino guided us firmly to the eleventh floor . " Bruce A. Gimbel . Son of Bernard . Grandson of Isaac Gimbel . Great-grandson of Adam Gimbel , the found ing father . I 'll have Bruce Gimbel waiting on the street-level floor to meet us by the time we get hack there .

" It 's going to be a real fun store to shop . " " What do you stress in training the salespeople ? " we asked . " The necessity of becoming a store family , " Mr. Griffith said , changing his expression suddenly from smiling to alert and stern . " Salesmanship is a lost art these days .

" Obviously , we believe in the city . Oh ! " she said as we got off at the sixth floor and sidestepped a couple of men lifting an Eames chair out of a packing crate . She waved to a tall man with a thatch of red hair who was heading for our escalator . " I want you to meet Norman Guile , in charge of our Food Center . " " ' What 's going to be different about your food ? " we asked Mr. Guile , who was wearing a brown suit and a green sweater vest . " You name it , we 'll have it , " Mr. Guile said .

Waiting on the ground floor , as promised , was Bruce Gimbel , a suntanned , boyish-looking man , wearing what must surely be the only conservative navy-blue topcoat left in town . " Hi ! " Mr. Gimbel said , cheerfully getting out of the way of a terrazzoscrubber . " This store is my dream baby . I 'm the only Gimbel in the company .
