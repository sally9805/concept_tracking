Higher office rents , the mounting costs of equipment and rising wages for office personnel are all contributing to the increasingly steep price that doctors everywhere must pay to practice their profession . In New York State last week , overhead costs grew still more . Premiums for malpractice insurance-which almost every physician carries to protect himself against lawsuits by his patients-rose by a whopping 93.5% . The increase will make the state 's doctors pay the highest average malpractice rates in the nation and could have an enormous influence upon the way medicine is practiced . <P> New York is not the only state in which the cost of malpractice insurance is rising . Premiums in California climbed by more than 400% between 1968 and 1970 and are likely to go up again this year . Insurance rates in Maryland have recently increased by 46.9% , and may soar another 48% if the state 's major malpractice insurer is granted its request for a hike . Even in such states as New Hampshire and South Carolina , where patients seem less prone to bring suit against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> There is a legitimate reason for the increases in premiums . Malpractice claims , once relatively rare , have become so common that one out of every four physicians practicing today can expect to be sued before the end of his career . In New York State , for example , courts handled 407 malpractice suits in 1968 ; by last year , the number of such suits had risen to 773 , a 90% increase . <P> <P> The number of suits has been increasing partly because patients are better informed and less tolerant of physicians ' mistakes-which do happen more often than doctors would like to admit . Ever more dependent upon specialists , patients also feel fewer qualms about suing a brain surgeon or dermatologist than they would their old and trusted family physician . At the same time , fat malpractice cases are more and more appealing to lawyers , who stand to keep as much as one-third to one-half of any damages awarded by a court . <P> Five years ago , successful New York lawsuits brought plaintiffs an average of $9,878 ; in 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out several awards exceeding $1 million in cases in which negligence was proved ; a New York court recently awarded Tracy Gamell , 12 , a total of $2,110,000 for brain damage suffered shortly after her birth at a Manhattan hospital . Nor , apparently , is negligence the only ground for a successful suit . Juries seem to be taking the attitude that when a patient dies during surgery his family is entitled to compensation , and they are calling upon insurance companies to provide it . <P> Crippling Costs . The resulting rise in rates is " a disaster , " says Dr. Melville Platt , associate director of professional services at New York Hospital . Most doctors agree . A New York City obstetrician has to shell out $9,433 a year to keep himself adequately covered against lawsuits ; a specialist in a high-risk field like neurosurgery must pay $14,329 for protection . Doctors elsewhere face similar hikes . Dr. Suzanne <P> Graham , a San Francisco anesthesiologist , paid $2,100 for insurance when she started in practice three years ago . Now she must pay $5,100 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real crippler. "
