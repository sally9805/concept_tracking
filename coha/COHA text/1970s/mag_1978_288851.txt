Hospices help ease the pain and fear of the terminally ill <P> For many months , the 35-year-old man has been receiving chemicals to halt his cancer . But now , emaciated and racked with pain , he can no longer tolerate the powerful drugs . Everyone , including the patient , realizes that the chemotherapy is not working . The cancer has spread , and treatment is being stopped . Even before the notion of death can be fully accepted by the man or by his family , a hospital official calls aside the patient 's wife . He tells her that since the hospital can do nothing more for her husband , he must be discharged and she must find another place for him to die . <P> In one form or another , such harrowing scenes are played out again and again each day across the U.S. Imbued as the medical establishment is with the idea of fighting at all costs for the prolongation of life , it is naturally geared to hope of success rather than the fact of failure . Once it becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems unequipped , untrained and even unwilling to deal with death . It is mainly nursing homes-which are often dreary , costly and isolated from the rest of society - that seem ready to shoulder that inevitable human burden . As British Historian Arnold Toynbee once noted , it is almost as if " death is un-American . " <P> Today , in a remarkable turnabout , a growing number of Americans have begun looking for a better way of dealing with the dying . In their search they have reached back to the Middle Ages , when religious orders established hospices ( derived from the Latin word for guest ) to care for travelers as well as ailing and dying pilgrims . Within the past few years , 130 groups have organized hospice programs , and about 20 institutions recognized by the newly formed National Hospice Organization ( N.H.O. ) are operating in the U.S. Unlike the way stations of the past , the present-day hospices provide more than attentive , sympathetic care for the dying . They do pioneer work in such neglected medical areas as the easing of pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counseling for both patients and their families . <P> Most hospices in the U.S. take as their model London 's St. Christopher 's Hospice , founded a decade ago by Dr. Cicely Saunders . The primary goal of the London hospice and its American cousins is to help people die with as little discomfort and as much serenity as possible and live as individuals during the weeks and months left to them . <P> Such care is often best given at home with the support of family and friends . Indeed , the first U.S. hospice , established in New Haven , Conn. , in 1971 , is only now erecting its own 44-bed building as a backup for its home care . It will continue to rely largely on home visits by staff nurses and dedicated volunteers . That home technique has been widely and successfully emulated . Says Dr. Walter Norley , 62 , who is dying of bone cancer and is being cared for at home by Riverside Hospice in Boonton , N.J. : " I do n't know whether it 's because I 'm a physician or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in a hospital than I must .
