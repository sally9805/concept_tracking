THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment I ETTER from a friend : Did the ordinary folk of ages - gone by appreciate the world-shaking nature of inventions and innovations when they were first introduced ? Was Gutenberg 's printing press instantly hailed ? Did David Hume 's theory of knowledge dazzle the populace , or was the reaction matter-of-fact ? I ask because I recently chanced upon a report of a device destined to change the world of politics as we know it . And so overcome was I by the staggering consequences of this breakthrough that a single account of its birth , buried in a very large newspaper , all but seized me by the throat and hurled me to the floor . It seems that the supporters of Senator Frank Church , an estimable Presidential hopeful , had come to a caucus of liberal Democrats in Massachusetts determined to claim a psychological victory from the caucus 's balloting . ( Psychological victories have largely replaced real vote-counting as a measure of political strength . ) Before the votes were counted , Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Senator 's achievement in winning per cent of the vote here to-day was termed remarkable by his supporters , who went into the caucus with little hope of any kind of victory . " Following the vote , they scribbled in the correct number ( about twenty-four per cent ) and distributed the prepackaged expression of wonder and glee to the press . As a longtime political operative , I was for a moment puzzled by this tactic . It was certainly brave . Had all of Church 's supporters somehow been kept from the caucus ( by a felonious violation of the laws of probability , or by tainted chicken salad at a prepsychological-victory lunch ) , it would have left the statement a shade limp . ( " The Senator 's achievement in winning one-tenth of one per cent of the vote here today was termed remarkable .. . . " ) It also raised some exquisite epistemological questions . Can something be proclaimed as remarkable before it happens ? Indeed , is not an expectation of remarkability a self-contradiction ? The readiness of those press releases meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning every single vote and conclusively proving Fermat 's Last Theorem would have been really remark-able . It was then that a shock of recognition swept my doubts away . I realized that , intentionally or not , these citizens had devised an instrument of such cunning as to remake the political Landscape of our time . They had struck a stunning , perhaps fatal blow to that mortal enemy of modern politics : spontaneity . As any experienced campaign worker will tell you , the spontaneous event is the nightmare of the electoral battle . An uncontrolled outburst a campaign worker 's admission of doubt about his candidate 's capacity or the campaign 's momentum  --  can unravel the most carefully devised political strategy . None of the tools of the trade  --  the thirty-second spot , the four-color brochure , the six-city jet tour , the carefully chosen words and carefully frozen smiles can make up for the accidental , unvarnished expression of vulnerability . For years , strategists have struggled to combat this menace . Each year , the weaponry has grown more sophisticated . Computers have learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters they type , to make them appear a more authentically individual expression . ( " Believe me , Mr. Willis , nothing would please me more than to personally visit you at Cloverleaf Lane . " ) At the 1972 Republican Convention , the minute-by-minute briefing sheet for the chairman informed him that at the moment of Richard Nixon 's renomination he would attempt unsuccessfully to quell the spontaneous outpouring of delegate joy . Now the final weapon is at hand : the totally planned expression of emotion and reaction . Since the key aim in primary campaigns is to do better than anyone expected , the trick is to proclaim that your vote exceeded your fondest expectations . ( Remember , Lyndon Johnson heat Eugene McCarthy on write-ins in New Hampshire in 1968 , but McCarthy " won " because of the expectations . And in 1972 Edmund Muskie " lost " with forty-six per cent , while George McGovern " won " with thirty-seven per cent . ) Following in the footsteps of Senator Church 's doughty pioneers , a candidate need only print up a single victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Senator Frazier today scored a surprisingly strong x per cent of the vote in the ? primary , surpassing the highest expectations of his supporters , who would have been happy with x-10 per cent of the vote , and chilling his rivals , who were known to have wanted to hold Frazier to x-25 per cent . " Indeed , this tactic can be applied to the substantive world of politics as well . Suppose , for example , the President is going to announce whether he will sign or veto a housing bill . Whatever the President does , Senator Frazier , a candidate for the President 's job , must be against . ( That is how the system works ; if you do n't like it , you can go back where you came from . ) Up to now , the Senator 's only recourse has been to wait until the President made his speech and then react  --  incurring all the dangers inherent in letting a politician say something in public . Now the solution is clear . Hours before the President 's speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows : " Senator Frazier today expressed an overriding sense of dismay and outrage at the President 's decision to ( a ) sign ( b ) veto the housing bill . At a time when the No. 1 issue across the country is ( a ) excessive government spending ( b ) lack of decent housing , the President 's callous decision to ( a ) further erode the budget ( b ) condemn Americans to slum conditions can only he called immoral . I shall do all in my power to fight this outrageous example of ( a ) profligate waste ( b ) miserly indifference . " There are , of course , technical difficulties . You will need to carefully instruct the copy desks that all the ( a ) s or all the ( b ) s must he struck out in accordance with the President 's decision . ( It would obviously not do to attack the President for profligate waste if he vetoed the bill . ) And , given the free-flowing alcohol on election nights , there is the danger that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , " or even more spicy comments , in place of both the ( a ) s and the ( h ) s . But these are trivial objections . The fact is that by eradicating the last vestiges of unrehearsed dangers the prepackaged expression of post-electoral emotion will surely rank as one of the great ? s of our time . ? ? Mr. Dolan at the Met WE 'D like to tell you about the recent activities of Mr. James J. Dolan , president of the Dolan Steel Company , of Bridgeport , Connecticut , and , for one evening last week , the Metropolitan Opera 's most unusual Ethiopian slave . His appearance as a special guest super in the triumph scene of the new " Aida " climaxed a brief but spectacular operatic career that began one afternoon in December , when Mr. Dolan and his wife , Edna , attended a charity auction in the opera-house auditorium . Mr. Dolan , an opera huff , was planning to bid on Rosa Ponselle 's shawl , but instead he got carried away by Item 5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Met Production of Aida ... and Invitation to Cast Party . " After some spirited bidding , Mr. Dolan acquired Item 5 for four hundred and seventy-five dollars . When he checked with a Met official the following day , he was asked to report at 10:15 A.M. on January 28th for the piano dress rehearsal . We met Mr. Dolan at the stage door on the appointed day , and found him to be a tall , thin , amiable Irishman in his late forties , with sandy hair , blue eyes behind gold-rimmed glasses , and an open , friendly manner . He was wearing a tan raincoat and carrying a shiny black leather briefcase . " My family is thrilled at the thought of seeing me onstage at the Met , " Mr. Dolan said as we stood at the door . " Five of my eight children arc coming down for the dress rehearsal , and my wife will be in the auditorium on opening night . " We asked about Dolan Steel , and discovered that it was a family business , founded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , process it , and sell it in flat sheets , " he said . " The year 1975 was a pretty bad year for us , and I needed cheering up , which is one of the reasons I 'm here . " At ten-fifteen , Charles Caine , the Xlet 's staff costume designer , conducted Mr. Dolan to the supers ' dressing area for a costume fitting . The two men disappeared into a crowd of seventy-odd bare-chested males of various sizes and colors , most of whom were dressed only in undergarments . Some supers were applying body or eye makeup ; others were pulling on armbands and collars or folding onto themselves short gold Egyptian skirts that closed at the waist with Velcro . When Mr. Dolan returned , he was barefoot , minus his glasses , and wearing a pair of white shorts , having left his clothing and his valuables with a security man . Mr. Caine handed him a jar of reddish-brown liquid and asked him to put on his body makeup . " It 's called Texas Dirt , " Mr. Caine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torso . " A water-soluble makeup that gives a nice gloss to the skin under lights . You apply it in layers and get darker and darker . " When Mr. Dolan " was the color of coffee-with-cream , Mr. Caine helped him into a short brown cotton tunic that left one shoulder bare , handed him a knobby black wig , and stepped back to admire the effect . " We 're aiming for a simple , comprehensive Ethiopian look , " he said . " You 're one of the prisoners . " As our party of three headed for the stage , Mr. Caine told us that this " Aida " required three hundred and 4 twenty-five separate costumes . " We have eighty changes of costume in the triumph scene alone , with three groups of people changing twice or more , so that in those twenty-four minutes eighty-six people give you a hundred and sixty-six different looks , " When we asked how this worked , Mr. Caine explained that groups of marchers wearing animal heads turned into Ethiopians or Radames ' guards by changing costumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spoils porters became a platoon of archers for the scene 's final tableau . " It 's a matter of precise coordination and timing , " he said . " You 'll see . " Onstage , John Dexter , " Aida 's " director , was showing a line of animal-headed men at the front of a large circular platform how to kneel in the profile position familiar from Egyptian bas-reliefs . " Kneel upright first and then lean back on your heels , " he told them . " And do n't wiggl , ' as you go down . " During a break , Mr. Dexter was introduced to Mr. Dolan , who shook him enthusiastically by the hand , transferring a considerable amount of Texas Dirt to Mr. Dexter . " You 're going to have a terrible time , " said Mr. Dexter with a slightly manic grin . " You and sixteen other prisoners come in at the back  --  bent over and looking yen ' defeated , I hope . Then all seventeen of you cross in front of everybody to stage left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed a defeated crouch and moved rapidly across the front of the platform with Mr. Dolan in tow . Placing Mr. Dolan halfway back on the left side of the stage , Mr. Dexter said , " Here is the difficult part . You have to stand absolutely still for the rest of the scene . If I find you blocking the chorus , T may have to decapitate you so they can see the conductor . " Mr. Dolan , shivering slightly in bare feet and brief tunic , nodded enthusiastically . " This is going to be a hairy rehearsal , " Mr. Dexter added , " because our tenor is sick , and if I try to use a substitute who does n't know the stage traffic he could get run over by a chariot wheel . " " I wish I had brought my glasses , " said Mr. Dolan . On opening night , we found Mr. Dolan in his private dressing room  --  Dressing Room 24 ? wearing his tunic , his wig , and a liberal portion of Texas Dirt , and surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two bouquets of flowers sent by old friends , and listening to Marilyn Horne , the Amneris , warm up in the dressing room across the hall . Mr. Dolan " That may be your point of view down there , Hodgins. not our point of view tip here . " told us that there had been some changes after the dress rehearsal . " They added a strip of red cloth to the tunic to make me more visible , " he said . " They also gave me some sandals . My only problem is that I ca n't sit down in here now , because I 'd ruin the furniture with my body makeup . " We walked down the hall with Mr. Dolan to see how Cornell MacNeil , the Amonasro , handled that problem , and found him standing in the center of his dressing room while a makeup man covered him with a color even darker than Texas Dirt . " In the last two productions of ' Aida , ' my costumes have been held together by safety pins , " said Mr. MacNeil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and cinched it at the waist with a silver-studded leather belt . " So the one thing I asked for was something that would n't come apart when I jumped down from the cross . " " The cross ? " we said . " John Dexter thought long and hard about bringing me in tied to a cross , " said Mr. MacNeil , " but not about getting me down from it . We 've finally decided that the best way is for my bearers to give me a sharp jerk forward , so that I react by leaping to the floor . " " Do you sit down in here ? " Mr. Dolan inquired . " On a sheet of paper , " said Mr. MacNeil , grinning through his curly heard . " After seventeen years of Arnonasro , you learn a few tricks . " When the triumph scene began , Mr. Dolan and sixteen other Ethiopians took up their positions on a sunken staircase at the back of the stage . We walked around to a cavernous backstage area on the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning rapidly into animal-headed acolytes and spear carriers , and noticed that a lot of Texas Dirt was coming off in the process . There was one near-collision between a spoils litter loaded with giant elephant tusks which was being borne offstage and a file of gladiators who were marching up the steps in the opposite direction , but , despite the dim light and the multiple changes , all hundred and fifty Egyptians and Ethiopians ended up in the right place at the right dme . When Radarnes ( James McCracken ) mounted his golden chariot and Amonasro swung up on his cross , we edged forward to watch for Mr. Dolan 's entrance . Finally , we saw him , moving rapidly forward from the back stairwell in a defeated crouch , leading a ragged group of prisoners around in front of a dazzling semicircle of Egyptian nobility in stiff gold robes , Two hours later , at the Opera Guild cast party , we asked Mr. Dolan how it felt to be out there performing on that enormous stage . " Just wonderful , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old hand . As a matter of fact , Bill McCourt , the assistant stage manager , thinks he can put me hack next month , as a bullfighter in ' Carmen . ' " " Let me tell you about Texas Dirt , " Mrs. Dolan said , looking up at her well-scrubbed husband . " It keeps oozing out of the pores of the skin for about four days .

Session 2 : " Marketing Disco Product " At the seminar on " Marketing Disco Product , " there were scores of people in flowered shirts . There was a man in a brown velour leisure suit who wore a monocle and looked serious , and there were several young men in service-station overalls ( the name of the discotheque they represented had been embroidered over one pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room , a very large person talked about the needs of the emerging discotheque industry . We sat at a non-ringside table and listened . With us were Garnet Plank , his son David Plank , and Sean Sperring  --  three men with an interest in the emerging discotheque industry . Mr. Sperring is about to open a 2001 franchise discotheque in St. Louis ; David Plank , with his father 's cooperation , is planning to open a 2001 franchise discotheque in Odessa , Texas . The three men were dressed conservatively . Mr. Garnet Plank , who is in his sixties , wore a nicely cur gray suit . He looked , at first glance , like the sort of man who would n't let his daughter go out with anyone wearing a flowered shirt .

" The very large person talking at the front of the room stressed a point he thought important by raising his voice . " We 're getting back to the needs of society , " he said , loudly . " People now are into people again , and that 's what discotheques arc all about . People do n't want a hostile , metallic , fixed-seat kind of atmosphere  --  they want what you club owners have to give them . " " I 'm in it for the same reasons as Sean , " David Plank said .

" " Theoretically , if you set it up right you can make a political statement , a social statement  --  anything , " Sean Sperring said . " You can take over the world . I 'm only kidding . " We asked the elder Mr. Plank if he had visited many discotheques himself . " I have been in one in Columbus , one in Toledo , " Garnet Plank said . " Did we go to one in Chicago , son ? No , I guess not . I agree very much with this man who 's talking now that this is a time of change . This discotheque idea is the thing . " " Mr. Plank comes along so we do n't go too far out on a limb , " Mr. Sperring said .

Lunchtime AS the weather around here becomes more unbearable , little ways to divert yourself can become important . Nighttime is not a problem . You can take care of that by accepting every invitation that comes your way . Midday is another matter . What to do about lunch ? So far , we have tried having it with different sets of people ; we have tried having it with the same set of people ; we have tried having it alone ; we have tried not having it at all . just the other day , we tried having our lunch while watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play " Dr. Kheal " at St. Peter 's Church , which is on East Fifty-sixth Street , and this new way of having lunch was far better than anything else we had tried . There arc two shows put on every weekday  --  one at a quarter past twelve and the other at a quarter past one . We took the early show . We got to St. Peter 's at noon sharp , taking our lunch along , as we had been given to understand we should do . At the door , we learned that there was no admission charge but that donations were invited . We made our donation , walked in with a sandwich ( ham salad ) and a soft drink ( ginger beer ) , and hoped for a good time . We got a good time . First of all , the theatre is a dimly lighted room with about fifteen medium-sized round tables , a red tablecloth on each table , and four chairs to each table . When we got there , about ten couples were already seated and were unpacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable-looking . We thought we would wait until the show got under way before we had our lunch , and then we were sorry , because we laughed so much . The show began with a man reading this from a piece of paper : " It is with great pleasure that I welcome Dr. Kheal to Theatre at Noon today . With this visit , Dr. Kheal is completing a cross-country lecture tour , which has taken him to more than fifty universities and colleges . After this lecture , Dr. Kheal will be returning to Harvard , where he will resume his position as Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Mathematics . I am proud to introduce  --  Dr. Kheal . " Dr. Kheal came onstage . Dr. Kheal , played by a talented young actor named Richard Hamburger , was wearing formal evening clothes and white shoes with red shoelaces . He looked quite comical . Then he started to act quite comical . He walked over to a blackboard that was already on the stage , drew a large square on it , and wrote in the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambition , " " On Energy , " and " On Truth . " All in all , Dr. Kheal  --  or Richard Hamburger  --  was a funny man . Also , he said very funny things . The thing he said that we liked best was on the subject of energy . He said , " How does one do a million small things ? One at a time . How does one do a million big things ? One at a time . How does one do one big thing ? Never . "
