 | The headlines are disturbing : PARK CLOSED BY POLICE , KIDS RIOT . . . SUBURB SEEKS VANDAL CURB . . . STUDENTS CLASH , FORCE SCHOOL CLOSING . So are the pictures : kids screaming defiantly , hurling rocks at police cars , smashing windows . So are the statistics . They show that juvenile delinquency continues to rise . The headlines happen to be from newspapers in and around Detroit , Mich. , but they might as well be from any part of the U.S.A. In response , feeling mounts and the questions become more insistent : What 's wrong ? Where are the parents of these kids ? Why do n't they control their children ? And if they do n't , ca n't they be forced to ? by law ? In many of the Detroit-area suburbs and in scattered communities in other states , that is exactly what is being tried . For a report on the responses of GH readers to the issue , see page 40 ? Ed . In recent months a spate of local laws , known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' responsibility for the actions of their children . Simply stated , the ordinances tell parents that they must control the behavior of their minor children or themselves risk paying a stiff fine and/or going to jail . ) In Madison Heights , Mich. , a parental-responsibility ordinance has been on the statute books for a year and a half . Declaring that " it shall be unlawful for the parent of any minor child to fail to exercise reasonable parental control , " the statute decrees that if a youngster under 17 twice violates a state or local law ( including moving traffic violations ) within a 12-month period , his parents " may be deemed guilty of parental neglect . " Upon conviction , they shall " be subject to a fine of not more than $500 , sentenced to a term of not more than 90 days in jail or placed upon probation ... at the discretion of the court . " This is a tough ordinance ? especially in a town like Madison Heights , which has a ten P.M. curfew for minors and where , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delinquents , but parents of any careless teen-ager who happens to lose track of the time on a Saturday night . It 's a highly controversial ordinance ,  | too . And the closer you get to it , the more controversial it becomes . In January . 1970 , when it became law in Madison Heights , loud cheers went up from press and public alike . Judd Arnett , a columnist for the Detroit Free Press , expressed the general view when he wrote : " Goody . It has been felt for a long time that if the Old Man had to pay a fine , or go to the pokey , when Junior becomes a menace to society . we might have a speedy return to the day when parents kept track of their kids and exerted at least partial control over their conduct . " The mail began pouring in to newspapers and politicians ' offices . It . too , was almost unanimously enthusiastic . Typical responses : " God bless you ! It 's about time someone had the courage to take this much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years that once you hit the family 's pocketbook. people will see that they , and not the police , have to look after their children . " But that was many months ago , and many people , unacquainted with the details of the ordinance , were reacting with natural enthusiasm to its title . And everybody is in favor of responsible parents . Today ? in the Michigan towns of Madison Heights , Troy and West Bloomfield , and elsewhere ? the first wave of applause has faded . No one is now claiming that the ordinance is the answer to delinquency . " It 's only one approach , " says Monte R. Geralds , mayor of Madison Heights , who proposed the ordinance and steered it through the City Council . " It 's no panacea for all the problems . " So the important question is : How much of an answer is the ordinance ? Does it work ? Has it significantly reduced juvenile crime ? Mayor Geralds says yes . So does Bernard Michrina , juvenile officer with the Madison Heights Police Department . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Michrina told me , " and have n't had one of those kids back . We just are n't seeing the same familiar faces the way we used to . " Similarly , in nearby Troy , Police Chief Forrest Fisher says , " We 're getting fewer repeaters . No question about itj ' Supporting these optimistic views are police figures from Madison Heights ( elsewhere the ordinance is too new to have produced significant statistics ) . The official record shows a definite , if unsensational drop in delinquency during the 11 months of 1970 after the ordinance went into effect . The monthly average for juvenile cases in 1969 was 76.5 ; in 1970. 68 . This works out to a decrease of about ten percent . Moreover , 1970 was the first year in four that the average monthly figures showed an overall drop in juvenile crime , - Those who argue for the ordinance reason this way : Lack of parental supervision and control is one of the chief causes of juvenile delinquency . Par- ents can be held legally responsible for exercising reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so . Conclusion : Careless , unconcerned , or weak parents will be motivated into doing a better job of looking after their children . But wait before you begin to cheer . Are statistics alone ever able to tell the whole story ? Mayor Geralds , discussing the ordinance , stresses the point that it must be used selectively , as an " educational tool . " Taking their cue from the mayor , the police therefore use the ordinance with only a minority of offenders . They look for mothers and fathers who " give you the feeling they just are n't interested enough or ca n't be bothered '  - -  for example , a father whose 14-year-old son was caught joy-riding in the family car , and who reacted with a shrug and the words : " What do you expect me to do ? You know how boys are about cars . " Parental-responsibility ordinances are made to order for such a father . But if the police misjudge a situation , the ordinance can misfire disastrously . Consider this case : A 16-year-old girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only a few blocks from home and had had trouble with her car . The next day , her mother was called into the police station and told she could be sent to jail if her daughter got into trouble again . The mother , a recent divorcee who was feeling vulnerable , reacted with panic . She " grounded " her daughter : no more dates ; no more visits with girl friends ; no more baby-sitting jobs ; home after school , period . Within a month the girl was threatening to run away . An alert teacher sensed trouble , talked to the girl , and arranged counseling for the mother . The counselor reassured the mother that she was not a neglectful parent . nor was her daughter a delinquent . The mother , realizing how much she herself was contributing to the problem , relaxed , stopped restricting her daughter 's activities so severely , and the situation was soon straightened out . Parental reactions like that are just what Madison Heights teen-agers anticipate from the ordinance ? and are afraid of . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's impossible to talk to her , " one boy said . in a typical response . " Since she heard about this new law , she 's even worse . " Even more widespread among the kids is the feeling that the ordinance is unfair . " If I do something , blame me ? not my parents , " one said . " Leave them out of it ! " The mother-daughter incident above illustrates another troublesome point . Although almost every policeman I talked to assured me that the ordinance is used to " educate parents " and as " a means of communication , ; ' I could find few other observers who would agree . " The ordinance is used like a club , " one newspaper reporter told me . " Some police use it better than others . Proper use means making subtle distinctions-  | and that 's never been a policeman 's specialty . " Of course no matter how judiciously used , the threat implicit in the ordinance remains . And many experts in the field are not convinced that that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander expresses this view in an article , What 's This about Punishing Parents ? " What most parents of delinquent or neglected children need is help . ... " he writes . What good , he asks , is done when the father of several children is punished for the sins of one of them ? Suppose he is sent to jail for 90 days and he loses his job . What has this accom-plished ? Listen to a father who had received a warning under the parental-responsibility ordinance because his son had repeatedly been truant from school : . " Sure I know the kid is n't doing too well in his classes . He 's in with a bad crowd and we 've been trying to figure out what to do . But things are tough . My wife 's been sick ; I could be laid off any day ; we 've got six kids to feed . The last thing I need is something else to worry about . ' ' Most " warned " parents are equally bitter . A more positive note was sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in manner ? who felt that the ordinance had been helpful . Her 12-year-old son had been caught stealing a pocket knife from a hardware store , and she was called in . A police officer gave her a copy of the ordinance and there was some discussion . " My son did n't say much , " she told me . " I thought he just did n't care . But when we got home , he exploded . He kept saying , It 's not fair ! You did n't do anything ! ' I tried to explain that I was involved in what he did , law or no law . The experience got through to him . Since then he 's been much more responsive . " In this case the ordinance seems to have lived up to what ' Dr. William Westmaas , a Michigan psychiatrist , sees as its greatest potential : assistance to a mother in a fatherless home . " It could give such mothers more authority in disciplining their children , " Dr. Westmaas says , adding that it might also help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clearly ; this is qualified enthusiasm . So is what one hears from social workers who deal professionally with delin-quent : One man , who asked to remain anonymous , sees the ordinance as no more than a trap for the unwary . " By the time a child is in his teens , " he said , " parents are no longer the dominant influence in his life . Teen-agers are swayed by many influences ? school , neighborhood , friends , peer standards and pressures ? which parents are often powerless to control . It 's easy to blame everything on mothers and fathers ? and unfair . " The list of possible causes of delinquency could stretch for miles . In addition to lack of parental control , the list must certainly include such factors as : family problems , financial instability , deficiencies in schools , modern mobility and rootlessness , bad housing , unequal employment opportunities , discrimination , lack of moral standards and religious training , the drug culture , materialistic values , too much television , low IQ , bad health , low self-esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and so on and on . Many of these factors are so interwoven they ca n't be considered separately . Also , experts admit frankly that , in many cases of delinquency , they are simply not sure about the causes : " Why does one child , in a family of four children , become delinquent and not the others ? Sometimes the answer is obvious . In other cases , we have to throw up our hands and admit we just do n't know . " The factor that shows up most consistently in delinquents is not lack of supervision but poor performance in school . A high percentage of kids in trouble with the law are also in trouble  | at school . ' James L. Lincoln , judge of probate , Juvenile Division , in Wayne County , Mich. , points out that 86 percent of the juveniles in the Wayne County Youth Home are far behind their grade placement in reading . Only about 14 out of every 100 of these boys will ever graduate from high school . " The common denominator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The repeaters have failed in school . They ca n't get a job . The way we 're headed now in this country , there will be about 8,000,000 school dropouts in the next decade , and most of the serious behavior problems will come from this group . " In a way , the ordinance raises more questions than it answers . One question that must be considered is Will it hold up in court ? , ; Judge Lincoln ' states his opinion bluntly : " The ordinance places criminal liability where there is no criminal intent . It is unconstitutional . No one who contests it will ever go to jail .. ' . ' Said Madison Heights Judge Edward Lawrence , soon after the ordinance was passed : " It will remain a good weapon against juvenile offenders as long as it stays out of the courtroom , but if someone is convicted and challenges it , I 'm afraid it wo n't hold up . " The mayor of Madison Heights disagrees . He believes that the ordinance will hold up , though he grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parental control . " Many lawyers think that this term can not be clearly defined , and they are backed up by the Supreme Court warning : " Legislative acts creating crimes must be clear and certain . They must provide reasonable and adequate guidance to a person who would be law-abiding so that he can comprehend what activity is to be avoided . " Therefore , in order for the courts to uphold a conviction under the parentalresponsibility ordinance , not only is a clear definition of " reasonable parental control " needed , but there must be legal evidence to prove that the accused parent has " failed to exercise " this control . " It seems obvious to us that ... parents can not be prosecuted , " Judge Paul Alexander holds . " We all know that a child 's misconduct , when serious enough to bring him into juvenile court , is almost invariably traceable to a lack of the right kind of early training , supervision and discipline . But to prove it in a criminal court is an entirely different matter . ... Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents have omitted to give their child the right kind of ' fetchin up ' . . . . " The judge concludes : " The mere fact that a child has gone wrong would not be sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction in a court of law , and it would be impossible to obtain legal evidence during the child 's preschool or even early school years . Yet , that was when the real damage was done ! " Lawyers seldom like to make unqualified statements , and there are a lot of " ifs , ands and buts " in opinions on the legality of the ordinance , but the consensus seems to be that the ordinance is not likely to be upheld . After a ten-year study of delinquency and legal penalties , Judge Alexander comes to this conclusion : " We find no evidence that punishing parents has any effect upon the curing of juvenile delinquency . " However , there are some parents who will not accept help voluntarily and need to be bullied into making constructive changes . With such parents , Judge Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence and probation but not actual punishment ) as a method of achieving a definite , desired result is largely successful . " And even here ? when parents are probably not seriously negligent and the children not seriously delinquent ? where the ordinance seems strongest , there is a question of how long it will work . Are n't parents and children alike reacting to a threat ? And we all know that threats are only effective when there is good reason to believe they will be carried out . If many more months go by and the ordinance remains untested , parents will begin to feel they are being bluffed . And if it is used but does not stand up in court , the inevitable result is that it will be ignored . Laws that are ignored only encourage contempt for the law ? hardly a solution to the problems of crime and de-linquency ! Disregarding the ordinance 's chances in court , there is another disadvantage to the vagueness of the term " reasonable parental control . " Too much room is left for interpretations where personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for unfair and uneven use of the ordinance at the local level . One policeman said , vehemently , that his opinion was that all working mothers were guilty of neglect . Another felt the same way about " parents who go on vacations without taking their kids along ? and I do n't care how much they 're paying some fancy housekeeper . It 's not right . " Both men were sincere . But how many of us would go along with such narrow and personal definitions of parental neglect ? In an attempt to place the ordinance in perspective , Judge Lincoln calls it but one of a series of " innovative ideas . " Some other recent examples have been : juries of teen-agers to hear juvenile cases and advise judges on punishment , and open-hearing laws that make juvenile-court hearings and records open to the public . " Early reports on these innovations are always that they have succeeded , " Judge Lincoln points out , " but after a few years , we do n't hear any more because they have turned out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parents in Michigan have been held financially liable for malicious destruction of property by their children since 1953 , when liability was limited to $300 . When first passed . the law was hailed as a powerful weapon against vandalism , and statistics were cited to show dramatic results . Liability was gradually increased and is now set at $1,500 . Yet juvenile vandalism remains a serious problem everywhere , and guess what 's supposed to solve it now ? the parental-responsibility ordinance . On the bench in Wayne County , which includes Detroit , for ten years , Judge Lincoln grows restless when he hears about such problems as mini bikes , tipped-over mailboxes , and ten P.m. curfews in neighboring Oakland County , current home of the ordinance . Wayne County has thousands of juvenile cases where Oakland County has hundreds ; Judge Lincoln deals daily with delinquency and neglect in its most appalling forms . " I have reached the point where I am for anything that will work , " he said . " If beating kids would stop all this trouble , I 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're wasting time with these simple answers . We can pass all the get-tough legislation we want . They wo n't do the job . " So where does all this leave us ? Back where we started , with the problem of juvenile delinquency . The causes are complex . The answers can not be simple . Worry and wishful thinking , while normal reactions , do no good . What is needed is interest , education , and personal involvement . The National Council on Crime and Delinquency sums it up this way : " The prevention of delinquency and youth crime begins with the kind of environment we provide for our youth in home , school , community and nation . It continues with services available to parents and youth on the verge of trouble and in need of help , and it concludes with the effectiveness of correctional approaches after court processing . Unless all three approaches to delinquency prevention are applied , we are trying to stem a tide by controlling an eddy . " Who is responsible ? All of us.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
