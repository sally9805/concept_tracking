txt Britain , the United States and the United Nations worked at a furious pace Wedhesday to prevent Turkey 's new offensive in Cyprus from opening a wider theater of war in the east Mediterranean .

As the Turks apparently sought to encircle Nicosia , the capital , fighting was reported within the city along the " green " line separating the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot quarters . But late Wednesday , Reuter reported from Nicosia that a cease-fire in the capital , negotiated by the UN , had gone into effect . In Ankara Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said Turkish forces would not take more than " a fair share for the Turkish population of the island , " news agencies reported .

At this writing Wednesday Athens and Ankara hung back from the brink of war , but war measures were under discussion in both capitals . Greek Prime Minister Constantine Cara-manila called the Turkish actions " a threat to world peace " and said Greece would take measures to defend itself . // *Big powers try to choke off wider war // Aircraft and naval units were on the move along the serpentine Aegean Sea frontier , where rival Greek and Turkish oil claims and other strategic interests clash . 2 .

Greece announced Wednesday it was withdrawing from military participation in NATO . de Gaulle emulated But Prime Minister Caramanlis , emulating the late French President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATO , announced Athens would continue its NATO political role . The practical effect was to remove U.S. control and command restraints from Greek forces . Apart from the need for a continued flow of ammunition and spare parts from the U.S. , this left Mr. Caramanlis at liberty to order any or all of Greece 's estimated 160,000 mobilized land forces , 38,000 naval personnel and 225 combat aircraft with about 25,000 mobilized Air Force personnel Into battle at any point from Cyprus westward to the Greek heartland .

Several British and Finnish UN personnel were injured in the early Turkish air raids on Nicosia Airport . Among the " big five " powers , only Britain , as a party to the Geneva talks and co-guarantor of the 1980 Cyprus independence treaties with Greece and Turkey , was in a position to act .
