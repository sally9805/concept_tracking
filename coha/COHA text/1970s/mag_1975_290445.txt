Bill Talbert , director of the U.S. Open at Forest Hills , was hot under the collar-and the weather was not to blame . As the nation 's most prestigious tennis tournament got under way last week , six of the men players , including top-seeded Jimmy Connors , were not ready . The reason : they were worn out from competing in other tournaments that had ended only the day before . " Golf does n't permit this , " snapped Talbert as he announced the postponement of their matches . " You do n't see Jack Nicklaus unprepared for the U.S. Open . Tennis is not structured enough . " <P> Not nearly . As the game has soared in popularity-a survey indicates that 34 million Americans now play tennis compared with 10.6 million only five years ago-so many promoters , manufacturers and other assorted types have jumped into the act that professional tennis is becoming more show business than sport . The signs are unmistakable : <P> &gt; Tournaments have sprouted so fast that the most ardent fans get fouled up trying to keep track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when . Last winter alone , World Championship Tennis had two and even three tournaments going at once . No. 1 Player Connors played on yet another tour while the women trekked along on their own circuit . And there has been no relief .

The championship series in World Team Tennis , won last week by the Pittsburgh Triangles , was played on a court without white lines . Each section was a different color-from brown to blue . Scorekeeping can be perplexing , particularly when it comes to tie breakers . This year Forest Hills has dropped the sudden-death tie breaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the winner must beat his opponent by two points , could go on even longer than the set it is supposed to shorten . <P> &gt; Commercialization has all but given the game to the hucksters . Billboards now hem in the courts at many tournaments and players often spend more time dealing with-or ducking - businessmen than playing . <P> Not all the changes in tennis tradition have been for the worse . The millions of dollars in prize money have attracted a gallery of international players . The game that was once dominated by Americans and Australians is now a polyglot sport with stars from Mexico , Argentina , India , Poland , Sweden and Spain . Such varied talent , combined with the switch at Forest Hills from grass to a claylike surface that does not favor the spasmodic serve-and-volley offense , prompted Wimbledon Champion Arthur Ashe to predict last week that multiple upsets would rock this year 's Open . Indeed , former Open Champion Stan Smith was ousted in the tournament 's first night match under newly installed lights . As last year 's Winner Connors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
