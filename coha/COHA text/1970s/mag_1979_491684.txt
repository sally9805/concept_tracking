// The adventure which took me to a forgotten island in the South Seas and six fathoms down into its incredibly clear blue waters started innocently enough during the cocktail hour preceding The Explorers Club Dinner in New York last December . It was a light-hearted conversation with Dr. Carl Walston , treasurer of the Club ; Mere Mercure , one of our Ball Corporation 's top executives ; Pete Bartoe , on Merc 's staff in our Colorado facility , where he had served as president in the designing , directing , developing , and production of various electronic devices important to the exploration of space ( he had also just completed designing and building the Ball-Bartoe Jet Wing Aircraft and served as one of its test pilots ) . My wife Virginia and I completed the small group . Pete was coming down to earth , as it were , and planning a solo sailing trip around the world . Simultanot be planted at depths greater than six fathoms . This undertaking would lend an added interest to my diving and provide Pete with a challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , visited by tourists and ' round-the-world sailing vagabonds . Deadpanning the idea , we put it to Pete Bartoe that if he could design a spacecraft which , while spinning about the earth at 26,000 miles per hour , would carry on board a pointing device having the capability of directing a camera toward designated areas of the sun , some 93 million miles away , within an accuracy of one minute of an arc , then surely he could easily locate The Explorers Club flags planted on remote coral reefs in the Pacific . Doctor Walston agreed to supply the flags , and did . In the ambience of the cocktail hour , the project seemed like just another everyday undertaking , and the challenge was accepted . In preparation for our part of the deal , Virginia and I began studies of the Fiji and Cook Islands where our travels would take us . Pete , in addition to getting his vessel ready , would probably be doing some special boning up on his navigation . Art Gaiser , former vice president of Ball Corporation , at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coordinates I gave him of where the flags were planted . Flag #1 was placed precisely at 18 degrees , 46.6 minutes/South and 178 degrees , 30.6 minutes/East , on a coral formation five fathoms deep , between the small , uninhabited islands of Yanu Sau and Yanu-i-Loma , which themselves are about two miles south of the small , inhabited island of Ndravuni which is located at 18 degrees , 45.8 minutes/South and 178 degrees , 31.9 minutes/East , in the Fiji Island group . For some reason , Art Gaiser had difficulty locating the islands because his calculations by the coordinates given placed them in the Atlantic instead of the Pacific Ocean , which would have been a rather remarkable discovery . Further study , however , indicated a continued from page 23 of Auckland ; the New Zealand Oceanographic Institute ; and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research of New Zealand . The purposes were to study marine biogeography and evolution in the Southern Hemisphere . The symposium held in Auckland , New Zealand , was attended by over 170 scientists from all over the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , but also from Australia , England , France , Germany , Japan , Canada , Saudi Arabia , the Philippines , New Caledonia , the Cook Islands , Indonesia , and the Republic of China came speakers , sponsors , and participants . It was truly an event of world-wide interest and significance . Sir Charles Flemming , K.B.E. , F.R.S. , of Wellington , New Zealand  --  member of The Explorers Club of New York , distinguished scientist , oceanographer , and explorer  --  gave the keynote address in Auckland on the fascinating subject " Evolution in the South Pacific Marine Biota and the Expanding Fossil Record . " His excellent paper set the general theme of the symposium , which was to deal with plate tectonics  --  the theory of " continental drift , " or the sliding separation of the continents  --  Africa , South America , Australia , Antarctica  --  over a period of hundreds of millions of years , resulting in their coastal shapes still apparently corresponding to the original breakaway serrations . Doctor Frank Talbot , Professor of Environmental Studies Programs , Macquarie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly : " As the story unfolded , one was able to put together many isolated pieces of evidence and begin to see , even if unclearly at present , a link between earth and shoreline separations , earlier widespread distributions , evolutionary shifts , and later colonizations , all in a geological time frame steadily becoming known . As a learning exercise , this made an extremely rewarding experience are working . The specialist working directly on these problems will clearly have had some of this perspective . To myself , and clearly to many others , the geological , palaeontological , palaeoclimatic , taxonomic , and geographical fusion provided major new insights . " At the conclusion of the symposium , a number of us participated in visits to various areas and islands for the purpose of studying and collecting specimens that were generally related to the theory of plate tectonics . Areas visited were in and around New Zealand , the Fiji Islands , and the Cook Islands . Comparisons supportive of the theory were made between marine biota existing in these areas and those in such distant locations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Antarctic . In a previous visit to the Antarctic in 1970 , I myself had seen fossils trapped in bituminous deposits and other plant and animal life formations identical to many found in Africa , South America , and elsewhere . Arrangements had been made a year in advance through the University of the South Pacific at Suva , Fiji , for a few of us to visit Ndravuni , a small , remote island in the Fiji group located on the Astrolabe Reef some 60 miles southeast of the major island of Viti Levu . During our stay on the island , we lived with the natives , ate their food , enjoyed their local entertainment , explored the island and its surrounding marine environment . Ndravuni is an ideal location for a multitude of scientific studies . It is suf-ficiently isolated from trade , commerce , and the usual contaminations of civiliza-Continued on following page tion to be relatively pristine , yet it is close enough that some native inhabitants are well educated , English speaking , and friendly to visitors . While our accommodations were somewhat primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsoever for visitors , certainly none for tourists . We were strictly the guests of the little community and lived in their homes . In the waters surrounding Ndravuni , smaller , uninhabited islands and the Astrolabe Reef itself offer unlimited opportunities for study of marine life and oceanography of all kinds . Local flora and fauna have been relatively undisturbed . Such wildlife as exists , birds particularly , are not fearful of man and can be approached for study and photography . In few places in the world can one find such a congenial combination  --  in a relatively small yet accessible area  --  of climate , people , unspoiled environment , and variety of materials for scientific study . We were indeed fortunate to have had this opportunity to participate in such an unusual experience . For example , Dr. Austin E. Lamberts of Grand Rapids , Michigan , a prominent scholar of marine zoology specializing in corals , identified nine different types in one cluster I photographed . The #1 Explorers Club flag was planted on top of the table coral known as Acropora diverse . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two little rocky islands of Yanu-Sau and Yanu-iLoma among a proliferation of marine life and in 30 feet of water . It is hoped that Pete Bartoe , or someone , will find the flag undisturbed sometime and in good condition . Reluctantly , we left the lovely island of Ndravuni to return to the real world . The departing ceremony was as impressive as the one for our arrival . Lengthy speeches in the native language were made , Kava drunk , and gifts exchanged , the meaning of each being described in great detail . A farewell song sung by the natives as we boarded our boats to be ferried to the ship that would return us to Suva was beautifully interpreted by a representative from the University of the South Pacific , Suva , bringing tears to our eyes . Every one of us left saying to ourselves , " If only we could return sometime and stay a little longer . " From the Fijis , we flew to the Cook Islands , which are scattered through some 750,000 square miles of South Pacific waters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The people are a happy conglomerate of Polynesians akin to the Continued on following page // Maoris of New Zealand , Tahitians , Filipinos , and other natives of the South Pacific and Asian Islands . They are proud of their heritage , their traditions , and equally proud of their self-sufficient and independent society . Their handsome premier , Dr. Tom Davis , was educated in the States , where he earned both a Ph.D . and an M.D. In a receiving line , for lack of something better , I said , " We 're from Indiana , " and he promptly replied , " Oh , I 've been in Indiana many times , lectured at Indiana University . How 's Chancellor Herman Wells ? Give him my regards ! " Small world ! Dancing is the native sport , like basketball in Indiana , football or soccer elsewhere . We were there for the Constitution Celebration , and a main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancers representing all the islands met in competition , with eventual winners chosen for each of several classes . Dances were beautiful , graceful , precise , spectacular , and , above all , strenuous , requiring real physical endurance as well as skills . While the dances had certain similarities in rhythm and beat and were generally allegorical , telling stories or legends pertaining to the various islands , execution of each dance was completely different . While we were headquartered on the capital and largest island of the group , Rarotonga , arrangements had been made for us to visit outlying islands for further study of their geological origins and their surrounding marine life . We spent a night on the partially volcanic , partially atoll island of Aitutakisome 140 miles north of Rarotonga  --  which Captain Bligh visited in 1789 in his ship the Bounty just before the famous mutiny . During World War II over 2,000 U.S. military personnel were stationed there .

Unfortunately , we were so exhausted from travel and exploration that none of us did justice to these lovely islands and their friendly people . But I did take time to make one dive and place the third of The Explorers Club flags off a well-known landmark , " Black Rock " on the northwest coast of Rarotonga . I had given my second flag to Sir Charles Flemming to place in the highlands where he would be going shortly to discover what was believed to be the last habitat of certain species of birds indigenous to the islands . I have been diving now for a number of years and in many parts of the world , but this dive off Rarotonga was one of the most memorable I have ever made . The water was that " gin-clear " I 've seen advertised so many times , only to bedisappointed . But here it was  --  unbelievable . Visibility was 200 feet or more . Strangely , it was a dead world . Blights , plagues , infestations of predators like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind had killed the coral . The normal abundance of marine life it generally hosts was therefore absent . Fish were scarce as compared to most of the prolific areas of the South Pacific Islands . But here , because of the clarity , the absence of silt and plankton found in more fertile waters , photography was excellent . Here , on a coral heap , I planted my third flag . I hope that Pete Bartoe or someone else will look for it  --  not that I really expect anyone to find it  --  because of the sheer beauty of the place . I inflated my buoyancy compensator vest enough to lift me off the bottom six or eight feet . There , motionless , I floated in space . I became the center of a huge , azure vault , eerie , silent except for the bubbles from my regulator . Spectacular formations lay beneath me , grotesque shapes and forms beckoned in the distance lighted by the diffused light from the sun above . It was a scene of ethereal grandeur , serene , implacable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world  --  all my own . I shall never forget it . From the tranquillity and feeling of detachment from the realities of the world , it was difficult to adjust to packing of baggage , hustle and bustle of airports , and long , tiring flights . But it was worth it . The contrasts made the memory of it even more beautiful .
