He never made a campaign speech . His name did not appear on the ballot . Barred from running for the presidency , rebuffed and all but humiliated by the present military regime of General Alejandro Lanusse ( TIME , Nov. 27 ) , he waited patiently in Madrid , nearly 7,000 miles away , while the votes were cast and counted . When it was all over , there was no doubt that Juan Domingo Pern , once the fascistic strongman of Latin America , now a weary exile of 77 , had been returned to power in Argentina . <P> Pern 's chosen instrument was an obscure politician named Hctor Cmpora , an ex-dentist who unabashedly describes himself as Pern 's " obsequious servant . " Cmpora swept last week 's presidential elections , the first held in Argentina in ten years , with 49% of the vote . Radical Party Leader Ricardo Balbin finished a distant second with 21.2% . Although Cmpora failed to get an absolute majority and therefore should have faced a runoff , General Lanusse unhappily pronounced him victorious . <P> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cmpora in government , Pern in power " - had so angered Lanusse that he had tried , unsuccessfully , to have Peon 's powerful Justicialist Liberation Front legally banned . He did succeed in barring Pern from the country until after the new government is installed on May 25 , but Peon ignored the slap , preferring to let Argentina 's working class descamisados ( shirtless ones ) speak for him . This they did , resoundingly . Even after 17 years of Pern 's exile ( broken by a brief visit last November during which he spent most of his time in seclusion ) , they still remembered him and his late wife Evita as charismatic figures who had challenged " the system . " The vote was , in addition , a rejection of seven years of inept military rule . <P> What does Peronism mean today ? The Justicialist Front has promised a program of land reform- " the land must be for those who work it " - but this probably will involve the redistribution of unused land , rather than widespread expropriation of existing farms , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalize all bank deposits ( currently some $4 billion ) and take over all foreign trade . Also to be nationalized are industries that " imply monopolistic power and/or strategic decisions , " but it is not yet clear which industries are involved . <P> In foreign policy , Cmpora says that he will revive Pern 's old , somewhat vague concept of a " third position " between East and West . The new government has already decided to establish relations with Cuba , North Viet Nam and North Korea , but it will most likely remain in the " U.S.-dominated " Organization of American States .
