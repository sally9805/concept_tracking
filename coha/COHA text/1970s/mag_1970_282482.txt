" The target today is a suspected enemy location near the gully behind that clump of trees , " says the American Forward Air Controller ( FAC ) from a tiny spotter plane just above the treetops some 30 miles northwest of Saigon . On the receiving end of the message is a South Vietnamese pilot , Captain Hoang Manh Dzung , 28 , who is flying a propeller-driven A-l Skyraider with a 4,000-lb. bomb load . Suddenly , standing the plane on its nose , Captain Dzung swoops down , releases a 500-lb. bomb and pulls adroitly out of the dive . After several more runs , the FAC radios : " Very nice . Hundred percent of the bombs were on target . " To a companion in the cockpit , Captain Dzung says : " Oh , we do that every day . " <P> As the U.S. continues to turn over the burden of fighting the war to the South Vietnamese , the Viet Nam air force is rapidly coming into its own . Already it has doubled its combat missions to 40% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also handling a considerable part of the bombing inside Cambodia . The South Vietnamese are receiving sizable numbers of planes . At the start of 1970 , they had only 400 aircraft , including 125 helicopters . By the end of 1971 , they will have about 800 , half of them helicopters . South Viet Nam now has 26 squadrons and 1,300 pilots ; roughly as many men are in flight training . <P> Though Vietnamese pilots often must sit on pillows to see over the instrument panel of American-made planes , they are by no means short on combat experience . Most American pilots , whose combat tour in Viet Nam usually lasts only one year , can expect to fly 200 to 300 sorties , or about 400 to 600 combat hours . Many Vietnamese pilots have been flying combat missions for years and boast up to 4,000 flying hours , 90% of them in combat . As a result , says General Lucius D. Clay Jr. , commander of the Seventh Air Force and son of the famous World War II general , " they can put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Time for Girls . When they want to , that is . Like their famed colleague , Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky , who also flew an A1 , South Vietnamese pilots are flashy , hard-living and at times insubordinate . The Vietnamese pilot may refuse to make a tactical support strike if he does not happen to like the ground commander calling for one . " American pilots go wherever and whenever they are ordered , with no questions asked , " says one South Vietnamese ground commander . " With the Vietnamese , you can never be sure . If you call for an air strike in the late afternoon , they will say that they do not have enough fuel . Yet they always have enough fuel to fly home in time to take their favorite girl out for dinner . " <P> For their part , the pilots complain that they are not being given the hottest U.S. aircraft . The U.S. has turned over 20 C-119 and 20 C-47 overaged transports as well as 100 Cessna A-37 light bombers to Saigon . The Vietnamese would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster and more sophisticated A-7 Corsair jet fighters developed by the U.S. Navy . South Vietnamese commanders also complain that while the U.S. needed 4,000 helicopters to conduct the war , it is giving the V.N.A.F. fewer than 500.
