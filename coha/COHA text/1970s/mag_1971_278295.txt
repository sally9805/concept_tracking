" I remember being really bored by a play on the evening of my tenth birthday , " Max Beerbohm once wrote . How sad that he would have been equally bored by The Incomparable Max , the play that owes its title to Bernard Shaw 's apt and durable phrase . Playwrights Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee also came to praise Sir Max , but they ended up burying him . <P> The work is a glue job rather than an organic entity . The authors took two of Beerbohm 's stories , Enoch Soames and A.V. Laider , and awkwardly mixed Beerbohm in as a character among his own creations . In passages that are almost unrelated asides , they have Max as drama critic quoting himself on plays , players and playgoers . These comments lack the pithy bite of aphorisms , and as out-of-context fragments , they lose much of the slyly inflected wit that is one of the special pleasures of reading Beerbohm . The tone is wrong too . Clive Revill employs a voice and manner of waspish arrogance , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Prescient Palmist . Of the stories , Enoch Soames is the better one . Soames ( Richard Kiley ) is a minor minor poet pickled in absinthe who harbors a paranoiac conviction : people who ignore his slim volumes , The Ultimate Nil and Fungoids , are turning their backs on a late 19th century Milton . He desperately yearns to know posterity 's judgment and makes a pact with the devil to spend a few hours 100 years hence in the library of the British Museum . There he finds that the brief and only mention of the name Enoch Soames is in a short story by Max Beerbohm . <P> Kiley is marvelously intuitive in the role , capturing both the smug vanity and simultaneous vulnerability of literature 's seedy hangers-on . In A.V. Laider , Kiley is a prescient palmist who foretells the death of four people riding in a railway coach . Or does he ? Beerbohm is having a little fun with the old writer 's problem of illusion and reality . Neither story is much more than an attenuated anecdote told over brandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , who was too much the fastidious dandy , too much the meticulous stylist , to serve as a vehicle for the broad , boisterous traffic of the stage . He considered his twelve-year stint as drama critic for London 's Saturday Review a penance in the form of intellectual slumming . He viewed the theater 's vulgarity with distaste , and the occasional passion of high drama with skepticism . He had his muses-grace , urbanity , nuance-and he served them exquisitely , but those girls never make the chorus line .
