Out on the frontiers of confrontation , it is tough to be a newsman in the U.S. these days . The reporter is spat upon by students , Maced by cops , subpoenaed by lawyers . It is tougher still to be a black newsman . On assignments , and sometimes in his own office , he is mistaken for a messenger boy , a janitor , an agitator . At press conferences , he will be the only reporter asked to establish his credentials . If he is a broadcast newsman , sources will look right through him and talk to his white cameraman or sound engineer . <P> Still , more and more blacks are entering the news profession , as employment doors that were once closed continue to open . Many blacks suspect that they are hired mainly because publications feel that they need a token Negro or two around . Even when the job opportunity is more genuine , some blacks do not make it because of sheer lack of qualification . Says Edward Bradley of WCBS radio station in New York : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black reporters . They found one reporter-me . " Sometimes employers will lower hiring standards for blacks , many of whom lack training simply because they never received much encouragement to go into journalism . This can lead to resentment on the part of qualified blacks , who feel that it casts suspicion on their own abilities . Says Lem Tucker , a Washington correspondent for NBC : " I can understand the initial skepticism . But after two years of doing good work , it makes me mad . " Many black newsmen persist , however , and some have already demonstrated that they are among the best newsmen in the U.S. <P> Few white newsmen can match the achievements of Carl T. Rowan , a distinguished reporter and foreign correspondent who became Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs , Ambassador to Finland and director of the U.S. Information Agency . Rowan now writes a thrice-weekly column carried by 150 newspapers . As a reporter for the Minneapolis Tribune , Rowan made a reputation covering civil rights , later received assignments on major nonblack stories . He covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Suez crises in the U.N . <P> Most Fascinating . Other outstanding black newsmen : William Raspberry , a columnist for the Washington Post , who has won for the past three years the top award for interpretive reporting from the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild ; Thomas A. Johnson , a reporter for the New York Times , who wrote a penetrating series in 1968 on the Negro in Viet Nam , and Lu Palmer , a reporter-columnist for the Chicago Daily News , who wrote memorable pieces on the courtroom shackling of Bobby Scale and the killing of Black Panther Fred Hampton . <P> Like Rowan , who devotes only one column in about six to racial topics , Raspberry might write about anything . But he continues to keep a perceptive eye on black issues . " The race story is the most fascinating story going , " says Raspberry . " So why not want to cover it ? " He points out that in cities with large black populations , it is also virtually impossible to avoid race stories . " Even if you 're covering something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black people inevitably enter into the picture . "
