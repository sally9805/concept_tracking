THE MAN WHO LOVED CAT DANCING <P> by MARILYN DURHAM 246 pages . Harcourt Brace Jovanovich . <P> $6.95 . <P> <P> It can be said of First Novelist Marilyn Durham that she has the courage of her daydreams . The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing is basically pure feminine fantasy , but the treatment is so fresh and untroubled that the book is one of the most effective entertainments of recent months . <P> The heroine is a reluctant frontierswoman of the 1880s named Catherine Crocker . At 35-a refreshingly ripe age for a heroine-Catherine is marooned in a Wyoming mining camp with her boorish husband . After one quarrel too many , she decides to flag a train to civilization . But the train is robbed by four bandits whose hostage she becomes . Naturally , the leader is not your ordinary outlaw . Strong , silent and sexy , Jay Grobart is stealing in a good cause . Ten years earlier he killed his Indian wife , Cat Dancing , in a jealous rage . Having paid his debt to society , he is seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <P> As they face the privations and adventures that follow , Jay and Catherine quickly develop a Tracy-Hepburn love-hate relationship . Jay is cold and scornful ; Catherine feels that she has traded one insufferable male for another . But eventually accommodation follows passion down a well-worn path . <P> Jay is a standard frontier alien , but Catherine is a refreshing variant of the headstrong heroine . She is a potentially capable woman to whom nothing has happened , so she has nothing to bring to a sudden flood of experience except some mulish preconceptions . Durham leads her through the standard scenes : the learn-your-place tethering by Jay , the strip-or-go-filthy decision , the threat of lascivious Indians . Catherine handles them all incongruously . <P> Though the narrative is occasionally crude , Author Durham has one important veteran 's trait . The reader senses at once that he is in sure hands and trusts her . One feels that , like Margaret Mitchell , she knows absolutely everything about her main character and could tell as many tales as Scheherazade about her . Producer-Director Eleanor Perry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has proclaimed it " the first Women 's Lib western " - just what the movement needs . The remark is understandable because Catherine is ultimately stronger and less rigid than the men who try to run her life . But Marilyn Durham is not inspired by headlines . What she is doing is spinning her yarn in the age-old , instantly recognizable way . <P>
