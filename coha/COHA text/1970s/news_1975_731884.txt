txt The 11 major New York City commercial banks tentatively agreed today to lend the Urban Development Corporation $140-million to help finish its projects , Governor Carey announced here . The agreement came just a day before an expected flood of lawsuits that could ultimately have forced the housing agency to declare itself bankrupt . It is a month since the agency defaulted on $104.5-mililon worth of bond-anticipation notes , and the 30-day grace period against suits by the holders of those notes expires tomorrow . For that reason , the significance of today 's agreement is much greater than the actual sum of money involved . Basically the agreement breaks a three-month stalemate between the state and the banks , whose cooperation was always considered crucial to a resolution of the U.D.C. problem . With the expected participation of a large group of savings banks , which are working on the details of a $275-million loan , the pieces are now in place for a long-term solution to what has been an almost daily crisis in the first months of the new state administra- , // tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable U.D.C. to meet all of its obligations , " Mr. Carey said . The state will now be able , to pay off the note holders and thus " cure " the agency 's de-* fault , something the Governor had said the state would be willing to do only if the banks , first agreed to contribute toward finishing the U.D.C. 's building program . Three weeks ago the Legislature appropriated $90-million to enable the Urban Development Corporation to meet its daily operating expenses , and early today it added $20-million more . The language of the bills specified that the money could not be used to pay the bondanticipation notes . That restriction will now be removed by legislation , Mr. Carey said . The commercial bankers ' offer is also contingent on the Legislature appropriating $80- ' million in the new fiscal year to cover the debt service on ' the U.D.C. 's outstanding bonds . Loan Negotiations Due Mr. Carey and Richard Ravitch , who has been designated the corporation 's chairman , met this morning with the legislative leaders to enlist their support . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said the Senator had agreed to the legislative changes . Mr. Ravitch said he ' hoped to ! have details of the loan worked ; out in 10 days . Many aspects : are still unclear . The terms appear to represent ; something less than what the state had initially sought : a commitment by the banks of ; long-term financing of the ; U.D.C. through their purchase of the bonds of the new Project ' Finance Agency . The 11 banks are Chase ManChemical , Manufacturers-Hanover Trust . Irving Trust , Morgan , Marine Midland , National Bank of North America . United . States Trust , Bankers Trust and Bank of New York . Today 's agreement involves instead a $140-million revolving , credit fund at 8.5 per cent in- ; terest . The actual Toan will be ! made to the Project Finance Agency , which presumably will ! use the money ? as it already ; has done with about half the : money appropriated this week ? to buy U.D.C. mortgages , thereby giving the corporation a I source of cash to pay contractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , Governor Carey said , from the ; " stream of revenues " to be generated by the projects . as they ! are completed . Initially he had said that the ! U.D.C. would require $370-mil-1 lion in long-term bank financing ' ; to complete its $1.6-billion ' building program . The savings banks ' offer of $275-million left ! $90-million to be raised , which today 's agreement does not cover . Further Funds Needed But the Governor said today that the agreement would carry the U.D.C. " into 1976 , progressing unit by unit , and then we 'll have to look to additional buildout money . " The credit position of the agency , as well as the money market in general , will have improved by then , the Governor said . Today 's development still does not prevent the note holders from going into court tomorrow . But the Governor clearly hoped to forestall that move by letting the creditors known " that U.D.C. is moving and gaining credit resources we did n't have before this morning . " One unanswered question today was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this extent , after weeks during which ? some , powerful members of the group had refused to offer the U.D.C. any credit . The only banker Governor Carey named in his announcement today was John , president of the Manufacturers-Hanover Trust Company , which is also acting as the agent for the 10 other ; banks that were parties to the agreement . Just before the news , briefing began in the Governor 's office this afternoon , a number of bankers were in the room , but they hurried out and refused to answer reporters ' questions . Meetings Clear Way The agreement was worked out over the last week in a series of night meetings be- ; tween Mr. Ravitch and the ' bankers . Late last week a settlement appeared to have been reached , only to collapse over ; the weekend and be delicately patched together again Inst yesterday . Once the savings banks had agreed to participate , the spec-1 ulation here went , there was great pressure on the commercial banks not ? to be the one stumbling block to a successful resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proposal for a 3 per cent increase in the state ' bank tax , which passed the Assembly early today and died in the Senate , was a form of political revenge , or at least a warning to the commercial , banks for the role they had I played so far .
