The house lights dim , the stage brightens , the oboe sounds an A and the orchestra tunes up . To audiences , all A 's sound pretty much alike-but not to trained musicians or to those rare individuals with perfect pitch . The Metropolitan Opera orchestra , for example , tunes up to an A that vibrates at 440 cycles per second-theoretically , the international pitch standard . In Pittsburgh , though , the symphony raises the pitch to 442 , half a notch higher than the New York Philharmonic 's 441.5 . In Berlin , the Radio Symphony Orchestra soars to 446 , enough to make singers ' eyes pop on a top note . If the strain proves too great , they could take refuge in Moscow , where orchestras revel in a plushy , warm tone achieved by a larynx-relaxing 435 cycles . <P> Now somebody is trying to organize things . A committee of the Council of Europe , meeting in Strasbourg , has just recommended to its 17 member nations that the world 's musicians get in tune with each other by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council 's most momentous problem , but if harmony is finally achieved , it may put an end to discordant , bitonal performances of complex works like Richard Strauss 's Thus Spake Zarathustra . When the Vienna Philharmonic played the Strauss tone poem in London a few years ago , the orchestra built up to a tremendous climax , hit a C-major chord and waited for the organ to enter . Enter it did : a half tone flat , since it was tuned to British rather than Viennese pitch . <P> Out of the Realm . Standardizing pitch would have other benefits . Violinists would no longer have to worry about strings snapping under increased tensions . Singers would no longer be shocked by discovering , as they walk onto a strange stage , that their parts have been transposed right out of the realm of possibility . Piano manufacturers would have fewer problems with shattered warranties . " On a grand piano , the pull on all strings creates a force of about 20 tons , " says Dr. Daniel W. Martin , chief engineer of the Baldwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycles adds another ton of pull . It could crack the metal frame or snap the strings . " <P> The concept of a standard pitch dates only from the mid-19th century . Ancient European organs show that the note A has varied from a low of 370 cycles to a high of about 567 , a difference of almost a fifth , or the distance from F to C on a piano . Mozart 's tuning fork shows he tuned his piano to 422 , which means that the Concerto No. 21 in C ( K. 467 ) is really a concerto in C sharp ( or possibly D flat ) . As for Bach 's B Minor Mass , it may have been written in B minor , but it is anybody 's guess as to how many cycles per second were vibrating in Bach 's B. <P> Variations and Vibrations . A desperate French commission that included Composers Jacques Halevy , Hector Berlioz and Giacomo Meyerbeer tried to sort things out in 1858 by decreeing that 435 should be the future standard . It did not work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church pitch , military pitch and virtually as many varia- tions in between as there were vibrations to choose from . In 1939 the British Standard Institution settled on 440 cycles for the A , but this supposedly international standard is widely ignored .
