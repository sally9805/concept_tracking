txt A dramatic oil spill that " could n't have happened at a worse time or in worse circumstances " has blackened an area in the rugged Rocky Mountains West for two weeks now . And it is challenging the federal Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , which must cope with such unexpected pollution threats , Nothing like it has ever happened in the agency 's young lifetime . Sometime during the day on Oct. 10 , with no forewarning , a 16-inch oil pipe of Texas-New Mexico Pipeline Company cracked just outside Ship Rock , N.M. , on the Navajo Indian reservation . Before the pressure-sensitive shut-off valves in the line could seal off the leak , 900 barrels ? close to 40,000 gallons ? of heating oil had spilled out into an arroyo intersected by an irrigation ditch . In the first of an ironic series of twists in nature 's timing , water from the irrigation canal coursed through and carried the oil down into the nearby San Juan River . Denver office alerted Suddenly the oil was on the move down the San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant Lake Powell , By this time the pipeline company , as the federal law requires , had alerted the Denver office of the EPA . And EPA 's George Rice was quickly on the scene , watching the course of the moving oil , coordinating the blocking of the massive oil slick . The chase down the river that followed and the frantic efforts to halt and barricade the oil soon had drawn nine different federal and state agencies ? and more than 100 men at a time ? to the banks of the river . In the struggle an aircraft and a helicopter have crashed , injuring seven . The slick finally came to rest , locked in debris , more than a hundred miles from where it started , in an arm of Lake Powell , boxed in at last by four massive booms . And a bone-weary cadre of men were left standing on the high canyon walls looking down on it and wondering at the set of events that brought all of them , and it , there . Now , moves to lift it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . Rich Lathrop , an EPA official from Denver , who was in on the early days of the struggle , had said , " You 'd be hard pressed to find a worse place to have an oil spill . " The extreme circumstance of geography ? 150 - foot - high sheer cliffs ? weather , and logistics have combined to make the slick difficult to cope with . The EPA 's Donald P. Dubois said early Monday morning , Oct. 23 , " We are not resolved fully how to get the oil and debris out of there . " To start with , EPA coordinators have moved in what Mr. Dubois calls a " clam shell , " a shovel-like apparatus designed to clasp onto the debris and lift it out by a dragline . A pump able to pass large objects is also on the line . // BY Henry Benson , staff artist ; UPI photo Workmen battle oil debris along San Juan River in Utah *Oil spill puts EPA to test // Lockheed Aircraft has helicoptered in a device of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by to begin lapping up any free oil that might escape from under the packed debris as it is lifted out of the water . West ' reconciled ' Even though EPA has not encountered anything quite like this on quite this magnitude , and as one observer on the site says , " EPA is earning its spurs here , " the West has long since reconciled itself to such events . The region is leak-prone , It is the scene of the most vigorous development of natural resources ? from oil to uranium . And the chances of spill , leak , accident , and slick are something the states have learned to live with . This particular oil spill , in its isolation , has done little apparent damage . The rains have flushed the oil from the canyon walls . Some bird life has been caught in the onrushing slick . Beavers have been sent thumping for cover along the river bank . But there have been few reported dead fish in the water . And the region is almost entirely unpopulated . There is n't evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pipeline company that marked the public rage against oil companies in the massive oil spill off the Santa Barbara coastline in the late 1960 's . " As far as we know , " Dr. Rice says , " the pipeline company did what it was supposed to do . It alerted us as soon as it discovered the spill ? within 12 hours after it occured . " Officials , however , are still trying to determine the cause of the crack . Warlike conditions The struggle against the slick and the debris has been carried out in near warlike conditions . The river banks have resembled a battle scene . The air has been filled with helicopters piloted by Vietnam veterans . The military the Army and Coast Guard ? has shouldered much of the work . Jurisdictional disputes between the myriad agencies that EPA is coordinating  --  from the Bureau of Land Management to the Bureau of Indian Affairs ? have simmered below the surface but never broken into the open . And Dr. Rice says that the " cooperation has been outstanding . " EPA officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks to claw out the oil-soaked debris and two to three months to get the job completely done , say they do n't know how occasional spills of this kind can be prevented . But they intend to be better prepared for the next one . The booms they have rolled into place in the lake and on the river will be harbored in the shallow edge of the lake when this job is finished . And when the water ebbs from its present high , the booms will be on the beach and ready in case anything like this ever happens again .
