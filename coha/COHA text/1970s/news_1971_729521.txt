txt The nation 's unemployment rate dropped substantially in June but part of the reason was a statistical aberration , the Labor Department reported today . After adjustment of the ' data to eliminate the effects of . purely ? seasonal changes , a particularly difficult adjustment in June , , the unemployment rate dropped to 5.6 per cent of the labor force . It was 6.2 , per cent in May . Both the total number of people ' . employed and the number unemployed : rose in June , but both by less than is normal for the month , when the labor force is . swollep by young people leaving .. school . ' The labor force . consists of those holding jobs or seeking them . In a confused picture , with numerous commentaries from political figures , a professional assessment came from Harold Goldstein , , Assistant Commissioner of Labor Statistics . Talks to Joint Panel He told , the Congressional Joint Economic Committee that the ? June figures showed some evidence ? of real improvement in the job picture but added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is real and . how , much ' is , the result of statistical factors , we ca n't say at this time . " For the second quarter of this year as a whole , unemployment averaged 6 per , cent , which the report today called " essentially . unchanged " from the 5.9 per cent rate of the two preceding quarters . Thus , ' the picture at midyear ap- , peared to be that ' unemploy-1 ment was not yet getting better but had stopped getting , worse . This would be consistent with other indicators , which show . the economy resuming ' its upward . movement after // the 1970 recession , but not yet at a very rapid pace . The June statistical problem arose from the fact that the sample survey of same 50,000 households on which the figures are based was taken unusually early in the month . The survey is always taken in the week that includes the 12th of the month , and this time that was the week of June 6-12 . Many schools and colleges had evidently not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while it went up by nearly two million people , rose by about one million fewer than normal . Sharp Rise Normal It is typical in June for ! those leaving school to take a while to find work , and the number of people in the labor force who are unemployed always goes up sharply . This time it went up 1.1 million , to 5.5 million , but the increase was less than normal for the month . Hence , the unemployment rate declined when the statistics were adjusted to account for what would have been a normal increase in the unemployed . The purpose of the statistical device of seasonal adjustment is to make the underlying economic trend more clear without the distortion of normal seasonal changes . Secretary of Labor James D. Hodgson , insisting that the June figures represented " a real improvement , " emphasized the reported reduction in unemployment rates in several adult categories of the labor force , including men and women . He said , " We believe that a continuation of the downward trend can be anticipated over the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in the average work week and in overtime in those establishments where overtime , was being worked . He noted in addition a sharp drop in the unemployment rate among professional and technical workers , from 3.2 per cent in May to 2.1 per cent in June . Because of the small number of people in the samples , however , the lower rate in the Unemployment in U.S. In percentage of work force professional category would have to continue ' for several months to establish a genuine improvement . Probably the least encouraging aspect of the report today had to do with total employment . Although there was some increase before seasonal adjustment of the data , the total number of jobs failed to rise after adjustment . Total employment as reported by employers with payrolls , for example , rose by about 500,000 in June , but after seasonal adjustment there was a drop of 300,000 . The declines were widespread , with manufacturing leading the way . Over the year since June , 1970 , unemployment rose about 800,000 corresponding with the rise in the labor force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The number of people out of work for 15 weeks or longer , an important measure of the " hardship " element of unemployment , was 1,167,000 in June , down a little from May but nearly double the number in June a year ago . Those out of work for 26 weeks or longer totaled 560,000 in June , more than double the number a year earlier .
