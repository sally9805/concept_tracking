txt To the untrained eye , " conceded the president of the Flat Earth Society when he saw his first photo of the gYobe from space , " the earth would appear to be round . " His is n't the only concept put out Of business by the view of earth from space . The day when man could only know what was in his line of sight or within smelling , touching , or tasting distance of his fivesenses , is gone . Seeing only to the horizon is a thing of the past , says one space scientist here , " because there are no more horizons . " Now , with cameras and supersensitive sensors trained on the earth from space , all manner of " secrets " can be revealed , in fields ranging from pollution to growing food , from when avalanches begin to where whales swim . When the Apollo 17 astronauts fire the engine that will lift them out of lunar orbit and into a course homeward ( Dec. 16 ) , theywill look ahead and see earth as few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that - way every time a manned space mission has left for orbit or for the moon . Cameras on unmanned satellites have caught earth in its every attitude and aspect and stripped away its secrets . And cameras still to be lofted into space will capture it still more . The earth and things on the earth will benefit , profit , or suffer from it from here on . One thing is certain ? there is no place left to hide . At least Richard W. Underwood ca n't think of anywhere . Mr. Underwood is a photo technologist who does his looking at earth from a cluttered cubbyhole of an office at the Manned Spacecraft Center here . He sees earth with the eye blessed by the turn of space events . His was the first eye on ' earth ever to see a photograph of the whole earth from space . Only the Apollo 8 astronauts , the first to orbit the moon , saw it before he did ; his eye was also the first ever to see a picture of a man walking on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now he is the first to say that the way earth is seen from space will change the world  --  if what is seen is properly used . Sensitive instruments lofted Not only the camera eye , but sensors so sensitive they can pick up whatever objects on earth reflect , absorb , or emit , are being turned on earth from space Nothing that can show up on the electromagnetic energy spectrum is safe from detection . And one orbiting spacecraft can look at 10 million square miles of earth in an hour 's sweep . Space-stationed sensors and cameras , for instance , get a view of pollution on earth that no man ever could see . They can see it in its full panorama , where it starts , where it goes , where it stops . They can tell in an instant what the pollution is made of , how concentrated it is , even how it hurts the environment hundreds of miles from its source . No thermal pollution can escape infrared scanners either by day or night These same sensors could also revolutionize agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen and sensed : what the crop is , how healthy it is , when it will be ripe for harvest . Blight can be spotted Mr Underwood says that in future years a southern cornleaf blight , such as the one that destroyed most of the nation 's corn crop in 1970 , will no longer be possible . The flight started before farmers ever suspected it existed . And before they could act , it had swept the Midwest . But sensors in space will be able to see the blight as it starts , pinpoint the very field where it is rising , and alert farmers . There is no manner of devastation or pestilence that Mr Underwood can think of that ca n't be seen immediately from space , sometimes long before it starts . An avalanche ? A space sensor can see it building before it crashes down . An earthquake ? The sensor can see the strain under the crust and alert seismologists long before it lets go A tornado ? It ca n't go into its first mad whirl without being seen from , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighted or sensed immediately . Floods ? Space sensors can " see " them long before they build . Flood threat detected Apollo 9 , the spacecraft that above all other , photographed and probed the earth from above , saw a greater-than-normal snowpack building in the Sierra Nevada mountains in 1969 , threatening the San Joaquin Valley . When it melted in the spring earth was alerted Emergency equipment was rushed to the valley . Fortunately the snows melted slower than expected and disaster was averted . But the valley knew disaster might be coming , and was ready . There is nothing about fish and their habits that ca n't be seen from space . Even their body oils show up on the spectrum . It is apparent immediately how many fish there are in a sea , what their life cycles are , where they came from and where they are going , when to catch them and what the yield may be The great near-extinct whales , Mr. Underwood says , give off a body heat that can be detected from above . And with that knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved from extinction . All this is one legacy of space that alone may have made the billions spent in space worth it . Mr. Underwood insists that navigation data that a ship captain can get from orbiting overseers can tell him about tides , currents , and heavy seas that " will ultimately save him many times more in money than the entire space program cost , "
