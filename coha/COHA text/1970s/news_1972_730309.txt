txt The Democratic National Committee chose as its chairman today Mrs ... Tean Westwood of Utah , a key organizer of Senator George 's successful pursuit of the party 's Presidential nomination . She is the first woman selected to head a major party , organization . But , in an epilogue to a national convention full of surprises , the committee brushed aside Mr. 's recommendation for vice chairman , Pierre Salinger , and chose instead Basil A. Paterson of Harlem , New York 's new national committeeman . Mr. Paterson , a former State Senator , is the first black person to serve at the top level of a national party . Agrees to Reconsider Appearing before the committee , Mr. said that Lawrence F. O'Brien , the national chairman for the last two years , who also served as convention chairman , had " reached a judgment that he will not stay on for another term . ' But , it was learned from other sources that Mr. O'Brien , in fact , agreed this morning , as a result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to reconsider his decision to step down . When Mr. took the news of Mr. O'Brien 's decision back to his staff , how ? ever , several of them expressed suspicions that Mr. O'Brian would try to take over the fall campaign and argued that the chairman should be a woman . The South Dakota Senator . and Mr. O'Brien agreed that perhaps it would be better to go ahead with the selection of Mrs. Westwood . New Treasurer Chosen Mr. O'Brien , who has played a ' prominent role in party affairs for 15 years , was said by intimates to be irritated that Mr. would push so hard to persuade him to stay without first settling matters with his aides . Donald A. Petrie of New York , a lawyer , investment banker and former chairman of the Avis Corporation , was selected as treasurer , replacing Robert S. Strauss of Dallas . The newly expanded national ' committee consists of 303 members from the 50 states , the District of Columbia and the territories , apportioned roughly in keeping with their populations . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions are the raising of funds and the planning of national conventions . Mr. Strauss reported that his final activity , the conventioneve telethon , had raised " in the neighborhood of $6-million . " That , Mr. Strauss said , will mean a net of about $3-million ! , to be applied to the Democrats ' $9.3-million debt , which dates to the 1968 Presidential campaign . He added that the Miami Beach convention , which ended about 3:30 o'clock this morning , had been ' paid for in cash . " Senator flew back to Washington this afternoon on his way to a two-week vacation in the Black Hills region of his native South Dakota . He had completed the first , and perhaps the easier , of the two journeys he undertook in January , 1971 . The nomination was his , and the campaign against President Nixon lay ahead . It is unwinnable , he and his associates concede privately , unless some progress toward unity can be made . The appeal to Mr. O'Brien was one step in that direction , and the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one aide called an " operation outreach " to the disgruntled barons of labor and captains of the " old " Democratic party . There were a few fragile signs this morning that Mr. might manage more than the skeptics thought . Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina , for example , said he had come to Miami Beach convinced that " the Democratic party could n't do anything right . " Now , he said at a Congressional unity breakfast , he and the other South Carolina delegates were " going home to work " for victory in November . Bouquet for O'Hara Also , at a Rules Committee meeting , tension over a series of procedural snarls evaporated when a young member from California walked to the platform and handed a bouquet of roses to the chairman , Representative James G. O'Hara of Michigan , " on behalf of the newly liberated California delegation . " Then everyone filed past Mr. O'Hara , who made ' some controversial parliamentary rulings at the convention , and shook his hand . But the Salinger episode showed just how volatile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentment lurks beneath the surface . All had been going along smoothly . Mr. had lavishly praised Mr. O'Brien , telling the national committee that , if he won , " there is no one anywhere in the party who deserves more of the credit than Larry O'Brien " and hailing him for having " without exception thrown his power on the side of party reforms . " Mrs. Westwood was elected without opposition , and Mr. proposed for vice chairman Mr. Salinger , who was President Kennedy 's press secretary and served by appointment as a Senator from California in 1964 . Suddenly , Charles Evers of Mississippi sprang to his feet and proposed that Mr. Paterson be chosen instead " to stay in line " with the principles of reform and representation of party minorities . Mr. Paterson , stunned , leaned Over and asked Joseph F. Crangle , the New York State Democratic Chairman , what to do . " Stick , " said Mr. Crangle . " You can never tell what 's going to happen . " Mr. Salinger , equally stunned , hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gary Hart , the national campaign manager . Mr. , also equally stunned , went to the microphone and told the committee , " Either one of these very able men would be perfectly acceptable to me and a great credit to our party . " Then Mr. Salinger , seeking to avoid embarrassment to the Presidential nominee only 12 hours after his acceptance speech , moved to the platform and said , " I think I sense the feeling in this committee and I would like to withdraw my name . " " We did n't have any choice , " an angry strategist muttered a few minutes later . " This is the most unrepresentative body in the world , except for the Portuguese Parliament . They just wanted to humiliate us , that 's all . " Something similar happened early this morning on the convention floor . There was no easy ratification of Mr. 's choice for Vice President , Senator Thomas F. Eagleton of Missouri . He won the required 1,509 votes and more on the first ballot , but not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's acceptance speech had been pushed into the hours when the television audience was nil . Introduced by Kennedy In the long roll-call , dozens of people won votes , including Martha Mitchell , Archie Bunker and Roger Mudd , a reporter for C.B.S . news . Senator was introduced by the man who shunned nomination for either the Presidency or the VicePresidency , Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts , who flew here from Cape Cod to appeal for unity and to praise Mr. and the convention for meeting " the test of greatness . " Mr. Kennedy swept the crowd . to its feet when he appeared on the rostrum . And when he called the roll of past Democratic heroes from An'drew Jackson to Lyndon Johnson , the great hall rocked with whistles , cheers and rhythmic stomping . He admonished the new forces who dominated this convention not to turn their backs upon . " those who have worked a lifetime in the cause of human dignity . " Many in the crowd heard that sentence as an appeal to the forces to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daley of Chicago , an old Kennedy family friend . Mr. , whose text had been released early in the evening , inherited from Mr. Kennedy an electric atmosphere and did nothing to dissipate it . As he ended with a series of appeals to " Come home , America , " the crowd dissolved into cheers , songs and dances . This morning , Mr. looked fresh and chipper , despite ony two hours of sleep . At a series of meetings , he sought to dispel the view , widely held in Congress , that his candidacy would hurt the chances of lesser Democratic candidates . " We intend to see to it , " he told the Congressional breakfast , " that the organizational troops that have been built up on behalf of my own candidacy over the last year and a half are meshed in every possible way with the regular Democratic organization , with the rank and file leadership of the labor movement . " He carefully avoided mentioning the national labor leadership .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
