txt Amid confusion over the Governments competence in enforcing the Taft-Hartley 80-day back-to-work order that the Carter Administration obtained yesterday against the nation 's 160,000 striking miners , renewed bargaining for a negotiated settlement recessed tonight , with new talks scheduled tomorrow at 10 A.M. A 10-man negotiating team for the United Mine Workers met into the night at the Capital-Hilton Hotel with a new , toplevel coal industry group headed by Nicholas T. Camica , a former coal miner who is chairman of the Pittston Company . Mr. Camica was joined at the bargaining table by Stonie Barker Jr. , president of the Island Creek Coal Company ; William V. Hartman , senior vice president of the Peabody Coal Company , and Bobby Ray Brow , president of the Consolidation Coal Company . It was a more prestigious group of coal executives than had met with union representatives during four months of fruitless negotiations to avoid or end the 95-day coal strike . And there were persistent reports tonight that the coal industry was prepared , perhaps by the weekend , to acceed to union demands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or all of the 30.7 percent wage increase offered in the settlement package rejected by the membership last weekend . Government Oversight The bureaucratic mix-up that marred President Carter 's efforts to make the Taft-Hartley Act effective occurred when the Justice Department failed to include an essential legal document in the 1,450 packets flown from Washington today to United States marshals in the coal fields . The documents are to be served . on the labor and management respondents to the Government 's lawsuit . Officials found today that the packets did not contain the necessary summonses , notifying those named in yesterday 's back-to-work court order of their right to respond within 20 days to the basic Taft-Hartley lawsuit under which yesterday 's temporary restraining order was issued . The mistake was to be rectified overnight by airplane courier flights , but it meant that legal service of the back-towork order could not begin until tomorrow morning . The Government lawyers ' gaffe served to put even more importance on a hopedfor breakthrough in negotiations . Coal industry sources said that the companies might be willing to retreat from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health plans if the miners would accept a smaller wage increase . Arnold R. Miller , the embattled union president , who was reported to have won a vote of confidence today from his fellow union negotiators , said late today that " we could get a contract in a couple of days , we 're not that far apart . " The resumed negotiations here , one of the main steps mandated by the court in yesterday 's Taft-Hartley injunction , were the day 's only significant compliance with a court order that nominally became effective at 7 A.M. today . Last night the Bituminous Coal Operators Association complied with the court 's order to reopen the mines when it notified its 130 member companies that they were required to be " open for business " at 7 o'clock this morning . The mine operators ' association said that many of the mines were open today . But virtually no miners reported for work , and none had been seriously expected . The Eastern Associated Coal Corporation , with 19 mines in Pennsylvania and West Virginia , said its properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety inspections -- and were ready for production . Not a man showed up . The noncompliance today was not a real test of the union membership 's determination to ignore the injunction , because only a handful of the 810 separate U.M.W. district and local units named in the court order were served today . In effect , the court yesterday , for logistical reasons , provided a weekend of leeway for delivery of the orders , setting a deadline of 4:30 P.M , Monday for complete service . Accordingly , the Monday afternoon shift in the mines became the injunction enforcement threshold . If the intensified bargaining here fails to produce some new settlement terms before Monday , prospects for the partial or " moderate " return to work that President Carter said yesterday he hoped for seemed doubtful , based on the defiant attitude of most miners . Even token compliance seemed likely to run the risk of violence in the coal fields . ' I 'll Stay Home ' In Ohio , Don Nunley , a district leader , said , " I 'll tell the men to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to hell . " In Virginia , Don Wallace , a local union president , said : " I 've got no choice but to return . But if I get a call that if I step in a union mine I 'll get my head blown off , I 'll stay home . I expect that call . " The miners ' state of mind was unlikely to be improved by Secretary of Agriculture Bob Bergland 's announced intention , supported by White House spokesmen earlier this week , to cut off food stamp assistance next month to miners who fail to return to work . In a speech today to the National Newspaper Association , Secretary Bergland conceded that he might not have clear legal authority to cut off food stamp aid to coal miners who refused to work , and said he expected a court challenge of his decision . George Meany , the president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations , called Mr. Bergland 's decision " an outrage , especially . for an Administration dedicated to protecting and preserving human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miners to agree to an unacceptable contract by starving their wives and children is a vindictive act , " Mr. Meany said in a telegram to President Carter . " On behalf of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. , I most strongly protest the Bergland action and urge you to order it withdrawn . " Representative Frederick W. Richmond , Democrat of Brooklyn , who is chairman of a House Agriculture subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the food stamp program , also wrote the President that a cutoff of food stamps would be " contrary to the law . " His letter was supported by a 20-page Library of Congress memorandum challenging the legality of the proposed cutoff . Until now , the striking miners , who receive no union strike benefits , have been eligible for $145 worth of free food stamps each month . In addition to whatever sympathy the coal miners might gain from the Bergland edict , the United Mine Workers received $1 million today in strike relief aid from the United Steelworkers of America . Yesterday , the United Automobile Workers gave the miners $2 million .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
