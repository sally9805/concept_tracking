txt As President Ford takes to the stump to build support for his economic-energy package , critics zero in on several features raising controversy and doubt : ? Will the huge upcoming federal budget deficits ? Mr. Ford estimates nearly $80 billion this year and next ? spur a new round of inflation ? ? Will government borrowing to finance the deficits take such a vast chunk out of U.S. capital markets that interest rates will be driven up and private industry be starved for funds ? ? Would the President 's plan to slap $30 billion in new taxes on petroleum have two negative effects ? boost inflation by raising costs of oil and related products , and deflate the economy by leaving companies less to spend in other areas ? On the latter point , Federal Energy Administrator Frank G. Zarb says retail gasoline prices may rise " some more " than 10 cents a gallon , while the price of home heating oil may go up a little less than 10 cents , if Mr. Ford 's program is enacted . Executive action Mr. Zarb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " foresees " a total impact of about 4.5 cents a gallon " on petroleum prices resulting from the first phase of the President 's ' program ? a tariff on imported oil rising to $3 a barrel by April 1 . This tariff Mr. Ford will impose by executive authority , whether or not Congress approves the second part of his request ? an equivalent tax on domestic oil and natural gas . " For the first time , " said Mr. Zarb , " after 15 years of neglect , we have a President ready to change the course of direction of a nation that was heading " toward deeper dependence on foreign oil . Now , Mr. Zarb said , the U.S. imports 40 percent of its oil . By 1980 this percentage will exceed 50 percent , " if we do nothing " to cut back consumption . Treasury Secretary William E. Simon , on " Meet the Press " ( NBC-TV ) Sunday , stressed the need " to put additional pressure on the world price of oil to come down , " by cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most " ? a 2 percent rise in the consumer price index through the President 's energy program . He and Mr. Ford , said Mr. Simon , share a " horror " of the looming budget deficits . But " I still want to stay to help our President " attack the " three-headed monster " of inflation , recession , and energy crisis . // * Ford stumps ; critics warn // Earlier , Mr. Ford expressed confidence in Mr : Simon and said he would remain both Secretary of the Treasury and the President 's chief economic spokesman . " We now know , " noted a Brookings Institution economist , " that the Arab oil embargo drained $35 billion from the economy , and ended up as a 3.5 percent increase in the consumer price index . " Mr. Ford 's $30 billion energy tax package , " continued the economist , " may cause a 2 percent rise in the consumer price index , if there is no pyramiding of costs passed through to consumers . " ? If pass-through costs total more than $30 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 2 percent . " Also , " concluded the Brookings official , " the taxes will be deflationary , to the extent they reduce demand for goods associated with petroleum . " Cooperation asked Democratic leaders of Congress , while promising swift action on an income tax cut ? though not necessarily exactly as Mr. Ford proposes ? x.xpress sharp criticism of the energy tax proposals . Aware of this , the President urged Congress to cooperate with him in starting the " train in the right direction and then reconcile differences over the fare and the speed ? and even over rebates on the tickets . But let 's get started . " Mr. Ford was speaking to an AFL-CIO audience in Washington , in the first of several speeches he is scheduling around the nation in support of his policies .
