A wave of revulsion and anger swept The Netherlands last week after terrorists seized more than 150 hostages in an effort to force the Dutch government to accept their revolutionary demands . The hostages included 55 passengers of an express train on the Utrecht-Groningen line and-to the particular fury and fear of the nation-105 children and five primary school teachers from the village of Bovensmilde . For four emotion-filled days , the children were held inside their school . Then , because most of them seemed to have fallen victim to a stomach virus , they were unexpectedly released . But the terrorists still held the school , the train and the adult hostages , and the slow-burning anger of the Dutch mounted ominously . <P> Creating Trouble . The kidnapers were South Moluccan rebels with a history of creating trouble in The Netherlands . In December 1975 another group of terrorists seized the Indonesian consulate in Amsterdam and a train on the Utrecht-Groningen rail line ( TIME , Dec. 15 , 1975 ) . Before that 15-day ordeal ended with the surrender of 14 Moluccans , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his death from a consulate window . <P> The Moluccans seek independence for their homeland , a cluster of 800 Spice Islands in the Indonesian archipelago , which they fled after the Dutch colonial empire collapsed in 1949 and an independent government in Jakarta took control .

The Moluccans apparently hoped to force the candidates into making concessions to them in order to win voter approval . Despite the country 's grim mood , the record 87% of the voters who turned out made decisions on broader issues ; they gave Den Uyl 's party 53 seats in the new 150-member parliament , a gain of ten ; the Socialists will now probably seek to form a coalition government with the Christian Democrats . Meanwhile , Van Agt skipped the voting to take charge of troops and police in the crisis area . <P> Until the children were released , Van Agt announced , the government would not consider Moluccan demands , which included freedom for 21 comrades imprisoned for earlier plots and a 747 jet to take them all to safety . The Moluccans warned of " many deaths " if their demands were not met within two days , but that deadline passed without murder .
