The U.S. Navy <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> Re your story " Attack on the Navy " May 8 : keeping the sea lanes open is vital to the future of Western Europe and the U.S. The more significant the disparity between U.S. and Soviet naval power , the more serious the threat to the security of the free world . It is imperative that the U.S. increase naval expenditures to meet the Soviet challenge . <P> <P> Robert Frisby <P> Rockville , Md . <P> <P> In evaluating our Navy , we should recall some of its famous mottoes : " Do n't give up the dollars , " " I have not yet begun to spend , " and " Damn the budget cuts , full shipbuilding ahead . " Then there is that service 's great battle hymn : " Billions away , my boy , billions away ... " <P> <P> Roddy Donoghue <P> Holyoke , Mass . <P> <P> Economics dictates strategy . Period . If the Navy does n't understand this , they 'll surely sink our economy through unwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> <P> As a Marine I served aboard a five-ship convoy stationed in the Mediterranean during 1976 . Our ships were rusty , overworked and in general need of a good overhaul . The Russian ships we encountered were sleek , efficient and menacing looking compared with ours . I was impressed by the Russians , and at the same time I feared for the navy that had to tangle with them . Let 's get our Navy back in shape so there will be no question as to who is No. 1 in seapower ! <P> <P> Arthur M. Hays <P> Tallahassee , Fla . <P> <P> The story left me frustrated in the realization that the American public must determine the Navy 's role in our overall defense program . If the pros ca n't decide , how can an average landlubber who is n't even sure of the difference between radar and sonar be expected to come up with answers to profound technological questions ? <P> <P> John C. Rose <P> La Jolla , Calif . <P> <P> America 's Cheops <P> Robert Hughes ' generosity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far too restrained . It 's an achievement in land use , light play and mass as visceral as the pyramids . Thank God this country has a Cheops like Paul Mellon to allow us the esthetic bravado of the likes of I.M. Pei . <P> <P> Rice Hershey <P> Cleveland <P> As every visitor to the museum will notice , there is a small label next to the art object telling who the donor is , Mellon , Kress and so on . <P> How about changing the wording of the label to " Donated by the labor force of the U.S. " ? They are the ones who help the donors amass a fortune so they can pursue their hobbies . <P> <P> Paul Greenhood <P> Silver Spring , Md . <P> <P> How idyllic Paul Mellon 's English summers must have been , that years later millions of dollars should have been used for what you call systematic collecting and I call pillage of much of Britain 's artistic soul . <P> Do not be fooled . It is 300 years of British culture and artistic patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essame <P> Mound , Minn . <P> <P> The National Gallery of Art is sheer delight . Thanks to Mr. Mellon for such a magnificent gift , and thanks to TIME for telling others about it . <P> <P> Barbara Whitlock
