txt The first Vatican meeting of a Pope and an Israeli prime minister was not , entirely comfortable and was marred by moments of tension , Premier Golds Meir reported in an interview published today . Mrs. Meir was quoted by the newspaper Moody as saying that during the Vatican audience with Pope Paul VI on Monday she thought of the Christian cross as the symbol under which " Jews were killed for generations . " ' " I did n't like the opening at all , " Mrs. Heir was quoted as saying . " The Pope said to me at the outset that he found it hard to understand how the Jewish people , which should bo merciful , behaves so fiercely in its own country . " I CA N'T stand it when we are talked to like that . I 've had previous experiences of this sort , and I wo n't give in to anyone who begins a conversation in this way . Oh no . " So I said to the Pope : Your holiness . do you know what my earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were merciful and-when we had no homeland and when we were weak , we were led to the gas chambers . " She said she had not been so excited about an official engagement since 1949 , when she went to the Kremlin to present her credentials as Israel 's first ambassador to the Soviet Union . " I SAT AND thought to myself , here is the head of the church , sitting face to face with the Jewess from Israel , and lie 's listening to what I 'm saying ? about the Jewish people , about its home in Israel , about Its rights . . " There were moments of tension . I felt that I was saying what I was saying to the man of the cross , who heads the church whose symbol is the cross , under which Jews were killed for generations . I could not escape this feeling . It stuck with me . " And he felt it , that a Jewess was sitting opposite him , and he said : ' This is an historic moment . ' " MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting " God forbid , " she replied . " Everything went off in meticulous quiet , in holiness . " But we gazed at each other frankly . His eyes bored deep into me , and I looked back with an open , strong , honest gaze , and I decided I would not lower my eyes under any circumstances . And I did n't . " On whether the audience may load to Vatican recognition of Israel , Mrs. Meir said : " At the moment I 'm satisfied with the fact that the Pope said thank you , three times , for guarding Christian holy places . " AND HE emphasized in the clearest fashion that he was not speaking of internationaliz. ing Jerusalem  --  until now the official Vatican stand on the Holy City  --  and he stated explicitly , and this is important , that it is necessary to continuo the dialog between the church and Israel , and that we must meet and talk . This I unhesitatingly call an historic moment . " Mrs. ' Meir also disclosed that Israel had asked for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be favorably answered . This appeared to clear up confusion over who requested the meeting  --  a dispute which had driven Mrs. Meir at one ma ment during her Rome visit to declare , angrily : " I did n't barge into the Vatican . " " BEFORE WE went to the audience I said to our people : ' Listen , what 's going on here ? Me , the daughter of Moshe Meibovitz the carpenter , going to meet the Pope of the Catho-lics ? ' " So one of our people said to me : ' Just a moment , Golda . Carpentry is a very respectable profession around here ' " ? referring'to Christ 's craft . At first she planned to wear a black shawl to the meeting because she bad seen the Kennedy sisters wearing them at the United Nations when the Pope visited there . But the Israeli ambassador to Rome told her only Catholic women wore such shawls " and why should I wear what Catholics wear ? So we decided that a black hat would be suitable . " But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy one because what would I do with it afterwards ? " Then she remembered that she had one at home , left over from old state events . She had the hat specially flown to Rome , Maariv said .
