txt Is something missing from your life ? The gentle pitter-patter of little hoofs ? If so , the federal government may have the answer to your problem : Adopt a burro . If a mustang or a pony is more to your liking , even more of those are up for adoption , too . You can get as many as you want , and they 're free . Just contact the Interior Department 's Bureau of Land Management , which sponsors the program along with the Agriculture Department 's Forest Service . The bureau would be happy to hear from you . It started the adoption program just over a year ago in an attempt to reduce the estimated 58,000 wild horses and 7,000 burros that roam federal lands . The aim is to ease the burden on grazing areas . But the agency is running far short of its goal of removing up to 10,000 of the animals annually . In the program 's first year , only about 1,050 horses and 150 burros were captured and adopted . The problem is n't a lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , the Virgin Islands and Guam have applied to adopt a horse or a burro , says Robert Springer , who heads the bureau 's program here . But at least 80% of those who are contacted about getting an animal get cold feet instead and change their minds , And by one estimate , a third of the applicants are children , some of whom want to put a pony in their backyard . Your average backyard Is n't considered an adequate home away from the range . Federal officials are stepping up promotion of the program in hopes they can corral more people into adopting the critters . But that may be about as easy as riding a bucking bronco . The program , you see , has some hitches . Sorry , No Deliveries One hitch Is the ultimate cost of adoption . Although the horses and burros are free , you have to fetch them . That can be expensive , unless you happen to live near Susanville , Calif. , Reno , Nev. , Burns , Ore. , Rock Springs , Wyo. , or one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animals must be picked up . As a result , there has n't exactly been a stampede of people from the East ; only about 200 of the animals have been adopted by folks east of the Mississippi River . The , cost of transporting the horses and burros varies . Arren Schebler of Long Island shelled out $700 , mostly for gasoline , to go adopt a mustang in Nevada and drive it home . The outlay was even higher for Millard Oland of Damascus , Md. , when he became the first person east of the Mississippi to adopt a wild horse from the government back in 1974 , before the formal program began . Mr. Oland paid air fares for his son and a companion to fly to Boise , Idaho , where they bought a truck for more than $6,000 . The two men then picked up four horses in Oregon and drove them back to Maryland . Mr. Oland says he needed the truck for his business anyway , but a proper vehicle for transporting the animals was required . He figures that it cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mouth , or anywhere else . Another potential hurdle is that to adopt a horse or a burro , you have to go through an approval program similar to the scrutiny involved in child adoption . Dawn Lappin , adoption director for WHOA ! ( Wild Horses Organized Assistance Inc. ) in Reno , who does the applicant screening for a number of federal regions , says she seeks references from employers , friends and veterinarians . She also does " psychological screening " to determine whether the applicant will provide a good home . A Question of Title " I want to see if they are interested in more than the body of the horse , " Mrs. Lappin says . She explains that she wants to know whether the applicant is concerned about the problems of wild horses in general , Including why they are being removed from the range and what lies ahead for those that remain . Mrs. Lappin says she ends up rejecting 10% to 15% of the applicants . The rejection figure for applications screened by the Washington office is only about 2% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible hitch for applicants is that you ca n't own the animals . The government retains title to them under a 1971 law passed to prevent people from getting wild horses from the government in order to sell them to pet-food companies . Officials say adoption applicants often do n't want to put time , money and effort into horses they ca n't own . But the horses ' foals are the property of the adopters , so some people adopt the wild horses for breeding . Most adopters , however , simply want a horse or a burro to ride . In most cases , the wild horses are sadly undernourished but are pretty easy to break . When it comes to breaking , says Mr. Schebler , the Long Island resident , his mustang was " about the best I 've ever seen , better than a domestic horse . " The Bureau of Land Management is working on several ways to try to get more people in the saddle . One goal is to increase the number of horses and burros captured and available for adoption . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the roundup under way this summer in the West . In the past , the animals had to be rounded up by riders on horseback . Officials hope to get a bigger yield this summer than before . The government is trying to eliminate some of the problems by seeking to change the law so that adopters can own the animals . And officials hope to open more distribution centers in locations that will at least reduce the long treks to pick up the aft-tees . The bureau also is trying to spur move interest in the adoptions by advertising the program . The best stroke of lock so far is that artist Ed Dodd has used his Mark Trail comic strip to publicize the program . The story of Susie . a prospector 's pet burro that was caught in a government roundup and was adopted by a small girl . recently ran in 400 newspapers with a circulation of 25 ration . Mr. Dodd says .
