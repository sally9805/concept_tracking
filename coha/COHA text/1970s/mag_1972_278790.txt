COMPANY annual meetings used to be quiet affairs , marred only occasionally by a question from some oddball stockholder about executive salaries or next quarter 's profits . This year , however , the annual meeting has emerged as a hot new battleground in the struggle over the social responsibility of business . Organized corporate critics in growing numbers are pressing proxy votes and raising questions from the floor on issues like minority hiring , pollution , defense production and company operations in South Africa . While the challengers have so far lost all their skirmishes , they may be winning a wider war to influence company policy . <P> Landslides . Some 30 firms-including AT &T,; IBM , Gulf Oil , General Motors , Ford and Chrysler-have faced proxy challenges from environmentalists , civil rights activists , consumer advocates and church groups . Other corporations , like McDonnell Douglas and Continental Oil , have had to cope with demonstrations against company policies or last-minute proposals from dissidents with token stockholdings . True , the shareholding public seems largely indifferent to pleas from activists . In three annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never polled more than 2.3% on any of its proposals - despite the support of more than 20 churches , 15 universities , five labor unions , three mutual funds and assorted banks , pension funds and trusts . <P> At least 500 shareholder proposals have been submitted to managements so far this year , but hardly any have polled the 3% of proxy votes necessary to merit revival at next year 's meeting . A proposal that Warner-Lambert study the effect of its advertising on drug abuse won 3.2% of the votes . A motion to include women , employees , consumers and blacks on boards of directors earned 3.9% at AT &T; and 4.2% at Chrysler . Also at Chrysler , a resolution for disclosure of information on safety , pollution and minority hiring polled 4.5% . At other annual meetings , managements disposed of such affronts with ease , like Gulf Oil 's 98%-to-2% trouncing of a demand for full disclosure of its activities in racially oppressive Portuguese Angola . But later , company officials nevertheless pledged to invest only in countries where Gulf can be an equal-opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted in favor of management indicated that they may not be so accommodating next time . The Carnegie Corporation , with assets of $305 million , voted against the reformers ' proposals at Eli Lilly , Merck , Ford and G.M. But Alan Pifer , the foundation 's president , wrote to chairmen of the firms emphasizing the " substantial importance " of the issues . Trustees of the United Methodist Church 's Glide Foundation ( $6 million ) wrote to each of the companies in the Glide portfolio that they would support management 's slate of directors only if it included women and " minority-group " representatives . Said Roger Kennedy , financial vice president of the Ford Foundation , which voted for management in several major contests : " How we voted is much less important than what we communicated to management .
