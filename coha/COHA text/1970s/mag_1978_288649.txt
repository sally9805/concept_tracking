Star Wars II , of course , and the further adventures of Luke Skywalker . Already scouts are scouring the globe for exotic , unworldly-looking locations , from the jungles of central Africa to the arctic wastes of Lapland , and shooting is expected to begin next February . If all goes well , the Star Wars sequel will be out by Christmas of 1979 . <P> Along with Luke , Darth Vader will be back , as menacing as ever , as will Princess Leia , Han Solo , the Wookie Chewbacca and computerdom 's cutest robots , Artoo Detoo and Threepio . There will also be several new characters , " of various genres , " as Creator George Lucas phrases it , together with " aliens , robots and others , including humans .

He was traumatized by his experience with American Graffiti , where Universal arbitrarily cut five minutes from his finished version of the film . He vows that it will never happen again . " It was n't a film by Lucas , " he says bitterly . " It was a film made by me with changes by the studio . That is n't fair . " One of the first jobs of Medway Productions will be to put American Graffiti back into distribution . It will be shown , with the five minutes restored , this May . <P> " I 'm simply trying to become a free man . I 'm trying to set up an alternative film making that allows me more freedom to do what I want , within certain parameters . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and individuality of film makers .
