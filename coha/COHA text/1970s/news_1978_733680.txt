txt The world will be listening closely when President Carter attempts to clarify American policy toward the Soviet Union at the Annapolis commencement today . His principal advisers , Cyrus Vance and Zbigniew Brzezinski , have been openly disagreeing about how to relate Soviet intrusions into Africa to the effort to conclude a second arms control treaty with Moscow . The President has seemed to side now with one , now with the other . If the country  --  and the Kremlin  --  are to be persuaded that Mr. Carter remains interested in quickly finishing the treaty , more will be ? needed than last week 's sharp denial of the contrary . Some of the difficulty is substantive . To find a balance in strategic weapons while the Soviet conventional forces continue to grow at a disturbing pace is doubly difficult . And to ask the Senate to ratify such an agreement while Soviet conduct in some parts of the world seems adventurous , at the least , is to invite enormous political as well as diplomatic complications . But some of the difficulty is also homegrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detailed Presidential discussion of the strategic arms negotiations and how they fit into Mr. Carter 's view of American foreign and defense policy . ? The SALT treaty is 95 percent complete . Apart from some relatively minor points , only two important issues remain , the Backfire bomber and modernization or replacement of land-based missiles . If Mr. Carter aims simultaneously to persuade the Russians of his sincerity and to counter his SALT critics , he can best do that now by a vigorous explanation of the treaty as it stands , and a reasoned discussion of the principles at stake in the remaining issues . What are those issues ? On the Backfire bomber , the Soviet Union has agreed not to increase production above the present rate but refuses to state in writing that the rate is about 30 a year . Language is also needed to limit the bomber 's refueling capability , assuring against attacks on the United States . On preventing new generations of intercontinental missiles : The Russians have several in development ; the United States has one , the mobile MX . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed eight-year treaty , the Administration would accept a ban on the testing and deployment of all new missiles . Alternatively , if the Russians prefer an eight-year limit , as they now suggest , the Administration would exempt one missile on each side from the restriction . That would not mean that the MX will definitely be deployed . The United States has taken the lead in pointing out the verification problems posed by mobile missiles . Moreover , the MX would threaten the Soviet Union 's land-based missile force and add to the instability that will be created when Russian missiles threaten our land forces in the next decade . That issue need not be resolved now ; it belongs in SALT III . Every indication is that both sides want SALT II , which would serve the security interests of each . But unless Mr. Carter can now explain his position effectively , he could fail to marshal enough support to assure either the treaty 's completion or its ratification .                 @ @ @ @
