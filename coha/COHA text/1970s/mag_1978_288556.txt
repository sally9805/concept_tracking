THE RAND McNALLY ATLAS OF THE OCEANS Rand McNally ; 208 pages ; $29.95 <P> Not even the most ardent oceanographer is likely to devote whole weeks to this huge tome on the wet 75% of the earth 's surface . But anyone who is interested in the ocean-from Jacques Cousteau to the vacationing urbanite curious about the formation of a beach-should enjoy diving beneath the covers of the Rand McNally Atlas of the Oceans and coming back for regular plunges thereafter . Like a galleon full of gold , the Atlas overflows with treasures , details of life in , under and around the edges of the vast roiling arenas where earthly life evolved . <P> Painstakingly researched , the book is the product of 35 contributing authors whose specialties run from marine biology to meteorology , and whose affiliations include such prestigious organizations as the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , the British Museum and a London-based group of scuba divers . Profusely illustrated with color photographs and specially prepared maps and charts , the book is also a visual delight . But the best feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starting with the origin of the oceans some 4 billion years ago , it moves on through the formation and movement of the continents and proceeds to a discussion of the composition of the seas today . In the course of the trip it discusses , briefly but lucidly , explorations from the time of Columbus and Magellan to the new undersea explorations of the Piccards . It looks closely at the myriad life forms that inhabit the oceans , and the resources-oil , minerals , precious metals-that lie beneath the surface . <P> Throughout , the Atlas scatters information like drops of sea spray , showing how waves are formed , how the oceans help make the world 's weather , how pollution is gradually depleting valuable fisheries and destroying salt marshes where sea birds breed . Its last important section is a series on the world 's major ocean areas , tracking origins of the warm Mediterranean Sea and the frigid Arctic Ocean , assaying values of flora , fauna and inanimate components of the marine world , the Oceans is a serious and sometimes terrifying book . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend more than a few minutes looking at this oversize atlas can feel the salt tides in their own blood and recognize the power-and fragility-of the final wilderness .
