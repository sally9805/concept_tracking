The films of French Director Eric Rohmer are so literary in method that they practically force viewers to grope for apt novelistic comparisons . His My Night at Maud 's was suffused with a Catholic sensibility that evoked thoughts of Mauriac and James Joyce . Claire 's Knee , with its themes of memory and desire , had critics remembering Proust . La Collectionneuse ( The Collector ) , the third of Rohmer 's irony-laden " moral tales " to reach the U.S. , may well get audiences to thumbing their Nabokov . <P> As in the other Rohmer stories , the protagonist is an amiably vain , self-righteous prig torn by his infatuation with two women . Adrien ( Patrick Bauchau ) is a dandified Paris antique dealer who decides to take a vacation from his mistress . His holiday goal at a friend 's villa near St.-Tropez , he announces , is " to do and to be absolutely nothing . " Unfortunately for his purposes , the villa is already occupied by a painter friend and by Haydee ( Hayde Politoff ) , a pouty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adrien gathers antiquities . Her affairs with the painter and a wealthy American art fancier gradually arouse Adrien 's own confused feelings of jealousy and lust . Amused by the thought of a new conquest , Haydee consents to sleep with him . But in a final spasm of pique , Adrien drives away while she talks to a brace of former boy friends . Alone at the villa , unsatisfied with the solitude he initially sought , Adrien at film 's end decides to rejoin his mistress . <P> In style and substance , La Collectionneuse is distinctly inferior to both Maud and Claire . Except for Hayde Politoff 's sensual gamine , the acting is monotonously low-keyed . Rohmer 's direction , never vivacious , is torpid even for him . Still , the masterful symmetry of the plot , the nuanced yet aphoristic clarity of the dialogue and the unobtrusive evocation of what D.H . Lawrence called " the spirit of place , " explain in part why Rohmer has lately become something of a film fan 's cult figure . John T. Elson     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
