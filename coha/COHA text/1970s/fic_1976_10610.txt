" Sometimes my neurons misfire . " " Is it a pill ? " " You swallow it , " Mohole said . " You do n't stick pins in it or call it up on the telephone . It does n't have children of its own and a two-car garage . Yes , it 's a pill . " " What would it do for me ? " " Depends on what type brain you have . " " They come in types ? " Mohole got up and took a meditative stroll around the large room . His hands were plunged into the deep pockets of his smoking jacket . He wore two-toned shoes , silver and black , with tasseled laces . His trouser cuffs had been unstitched and extended full length , leaving shriveled indentations where the turned-up folds had been . He took a large green pill out of his pocket and put it on his tongue . His face seemed a hasty contrivance , making Billy think of a police sketch of a suspect as described by several witnesses . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very thin , seemingly at odds with the general heft of his body . He had a flat nose and high cheekbones and his electrified hair curled almost straight up . He closed his eyes now and threw back his head in a sudden convulsive motion , simultaneously gasping as he swallowed the pill . " Except for the first one thousandth of a second , we can trace the evolution of the universe from the big bang to the present moment , " he said . " In my early work on background radiation , which is detectable evidence of the fireball of the big bang , if there was a big bang , I developed a theory , listen to this , about a strange kind of mechanism at work in the universe . This is the value-dark dimension , or mohole totality , and it 's the core idea of a unique system of relativity . This is Moholean relativity , just beginning to attract attention , very controversial , named by me after myself . What I theorize happens in a mohole is that X-rays , gamma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust clouds and so forth are trapped and held by relativistic forces we do n't fully understand as yet  --  forces created in the first one thousandth of a second after the universe began . Incidentally it 's no good trying to visualize a mohole . I 've already tried and it ca n't be done . Nobodyp181knows what it looks like because it does n't look like anything . And we ca n't pinpoint its location because it seems to have many locations  --  another way of saying there are moholes numbering n  --  and they all seem to shift , affecting different parts of the computer universe for varying amounts of time . The sum total of all moholes is what I call the value-dark dimension . All the key words in this explanation , by the way , are totally misleading due to the everyday quirks of language . " He returned to the chair and sat . " A mohole traps electromagnetic information , among other things , and then either releases it or does n't . It 's as though the mohole were a surface that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another part of the universe . But it 's not a surface and it does n't absorb . It 's a mohole . It 's part of a theoretical dimension lacking spatial extent and devoid of time value . Value-dark in other words . " He rubbed his crotch briefly and then crossed his legs without remembering to unwedge his hand . " The answer to what happened in the first one thousandth of a second after the universe began probably hinges on an investigation of exo-ionic sylphing compounds . This substance seems to be present , as far as I can tell , wherever there are moholes , although what I 've just said indicates , more than anything else , the inadequacies of human language in the face of the mohole phenomenon , since wherever there are moholes ' implies that a mohole occupies space , which it does n't . I suppose it could be said that a mohole is space-time raised to a higher electrovalent power , or sylphed . " He leaned to one side , resting his head in his free hand and appearing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universe is open at the bottom , closed at the top . Imagine two triangles sharing the same base . With one abnormality : the base is invisible . This gives us two apexes , representing the closed top , while the lack of a base signifies the invisible mass . Can you visualizesuch a figure ? " " A stellated twilligon . " " I postulate eventual collapse in a sort of n-bottomed hole or terminal mohole . First let me describe the two paths of expansion in my modelp182paths represented by the two left or ascending sides of the twilligon as you call it , both lines generated by the same point . One path is taken up by detectable matter , growing outward since the big bang . The other line is gravity , getting stronger as the universe becomes more dense with both detectable and missing matter . We are currently at the apex of matter , the halfway point of gravity . As expansion ceases we turn our attention to the right or descending sides of the figure . What was open begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the twilligon . Gravity becomes dominant at the sub-apex . The two right sides converge at the same terminal point . Gravity clutches matter in a terrific frenzy . " His hand had sunk even deeper into the pouch between his thighs and he spoke very slowly now , talking almost by rote . " Nothing escapes the final collapse into an entity that nearly contradictsthe word entity . ' On second thought , let 's not say nothing . ' Let 's say almost nothing . ' I leave an opening , you see . I make an allowance for an indefinite number of bottoms . The average hole is either bottomless or uni-bottomed . An n-bottomed hole allows my model to qualify as an open universe . This is the privilege of a selfconfessedmaverick . A minor maneuver just short of cheating . All this gorgeous matter-crush should n't have to end in a totally hopeless situation . I give things a chance to drip through . The final mohole is not leakproof . I leave a little opening . We ca n't actually see this on paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the twilligon conclude in a single point and you ca n't have an opening in a point . But we can pretend a little , ca n't we ? We 're not so scientific that we ca n't have a little make-believe , right ? Then , if something drips through , there 's a continuation , another chance , the universe refreshed . " Seconds after he spoke the last word he closed his eyes and fell asleep . Billy thought of leaving but remembered that Kyzyl was waiting outside to escort him . He assumed Kyzyl would n't leave , or let him leave , without some word from Orang Mohole , who had put the escort rule into effect . After half an hour Mohole opened his eyes . " If Moholean relativity is valid , " he said , " we 'll one day witness events that do not conform to the predispositions of science . We may be confronted , pay attention , with a totally unforeseen set of circum/stances . This is implicit in Moholean relativity and explains why my theorizing has n't won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheops Feeley Medal . " " Twice , " he said . " But neither time for moholes . Just mention the value-dark dimension and people go glassy-eyed . All these fears about invisible mass . These morbid parties full of whimpering people . Missing matter is explained by Moholean relativity . The mass holding the galaxies together is trapped in moholes . This is why we ca n't find it . Some people accept this but many more do n't . Thus the end-of-theworldparties . Oddly the people showing the greatest fear are often the same ones who support every step in my formulation , from the big bang to the n-bottomed hole . The explanation for the missing mass frightens them more than the fact that so much mass is missing . These are scientists so-called . What 's your reaction ? " " If you deserve it , you should get it . " " It would be unprecedented , a third Cheops Feeley . The award secretly coveted by everyone in the sciences . The one they 'd lie and cheat to get . It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of madness to it . Of course , no one says this openly . But we all know that madness content is a determining factor . " " How much in cash ? " " When you talk about cash , stick to the Nobel Prize . I 'll never get one of those , not for something with the high madness content of mo-holes . " " If it 's so crazy , why blame the people afraid of it ? " " Theory , in theory , that 's in theory . Everything we 've discussed is pure theory . In theory it 's soothing , it 's lovely , it explains a great deal . If the theory is ever tested , however , and if they find evidence of reallifemoholes , then it 's every man for himself . The laws are different there , you see . Although some of my lesser colleagues would argue against this , I am convinced that alternate physics is not designed to cope with physical reality ; that is , with the real world . As kingpin , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been part of my psychological value pattern . I have never been far from snapping . This is in confidence I 'm telling you this . " " What do you think would happen if you snapped ? "  | " We wo n't talk about that , " Mohole said . " Anyway , about the Nobel Prize , are n't they holding up some of the awards this year ? " " You got yours . " " I think they 're trying to decide some of the tricky ones . " " I 'm completely self-taught , " Mohole said . " I took correspondence courses . I went to the library . I practically lived in the library . A lot of people become deeply involved in their work but only self-taught people experience total murderous obsession . It took years but I finally beat them at their own game . " " What game ? " " Science . " " What 's wrong with two medals with your kind of background ? " " I 'm a snapper , that 's what wrong . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the closet . " " Then what ? " " We wo n't discuss it further . " " They 'll want me getting back there to sit in . " " I was fanatically determined to make my mark among the great figures of modern science and I 've done it , I 've succeeded , a two-time Cheops Feeley medalist , all the work and struggle rewarded with an entire theoretical system of relativity named in my honor . But plenty could still happen if it moves out of the realm of theory . " " Named in your honor by you yourself . " " Are you criticizing ? " " Not that I 'm criticizing . " " Einstein was n't all wrong , you know . I certainly do n't think my efforts lead inescapably to that conclusion . He did some promising work in pure mathematics before regrettably abandoning that field at the age of sixteen , I believe it was . " " You mean Einstein was n't all right . He made a little mistake here and there . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be raising my voice , " Mohole said in a calm tone , " it 's only because I recognize your right to correct me . I would n't be yelling if I did n't respect you . Yelling is a bond between people who respectp185each other despite invalid corrections . We yell and scold as a way of paying homage to each other 's views . This is the burden of friendship between extremely high-strung individuals . If we did n't accept the burden , we 'd be sworn enemies . Friendship is exasperating at best . But think of the alternative . " " I am . " " The essence of my brand of relativity  --  that in a mohole the laws of physics vary from one observer to another  --  is at odds with every notion of the universe that displays a faith in nature . In the value-dark dimensionthe laws are not equally binding in all frames of reference , whether accelerated or nonaccelerated , and if I get up and leave suddenly it 's because I have to use the vomitorium . " He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if he threw his head back as abruptly as he had the last time he swallowed , the head would smash against the back of the chair , perhaps causing a whiplash injury to Mohole 's neck or spine . But this time he used an abbreviated head-jerk , beginning his gasp sooner and sustaining it until a scant trace of bilious secretion appeared on his lips . Billy thought this would be followed by stomach matter , the gush itself , but before it could happen Mohole rose from the chair , uttering hoarse dry sounds , and disappeared into one of the rear chambers . When he returned he was wearing a turquoise cravat . " So the radio signals have the characteristics of an echo , " he said . " Although a mohole has no surface and radiates no heat , the message gives every indication of having been reflected from a high-temperature object of very dense surface composition . " " But you do n't want to know what it says . " " Now that Ratner 's star has been ruled out as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presuppose a new conclusion . We want to pursue certain lines of argument without outside equivocation . In other words you need n't overexert yourself on cracking the code . " " You want to find out who sent it and from where but not what it says . " It would only beg the question . " " An answer . "  | " Exactly , " Mohole said . " It 's probably not a good idea to say who 's going to stop me if 1 decide to keep working . " " Can you blow bubbles with spit ? " " Only little . " " I do big , " Mohole said . " Can you sneeze out of just one nostril ? " " Have a greenie . " " They 're so big . I 've never seen pills that big . " " Have one for your head . " " Look how big . " " Have a greenie . " " Even if I knew what they did to my type brain , I could n't swallow it because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't . I concede that . But have one anyway . " " Can you belch at will ? " " A greenie , " Mohole said . " Everybody knows about drugs and jumping off roofs . " " Do it to please me . " " How can it please you to give me something I do n't want ? " " That 's the way high-strung people are . We expect others to make small sacrifices for the sake of our emotional calm . Now that I 've explainedthings , will you take the greenie ? " " No . " " I feel hurt when people refuse to accept what I offer . I ca n't tell you how hurt I feel . Hurt enough to snap . Granted , some people are n't known as swallowers . Still , I hurt all over . In fact I see myself with a high-powered rifle and a whole lot of ammunition . I 'm standing in a window high above the street . " " What else ? " " That 's all I 'm saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value pattern is what it is and there 's nothing I can do about it . "  | " A deal , " the boy said . " I 'll take the greenie if I can keep it for later . " " Done , " Mohole said . " Once it 's out of my hands and in yours , I know you 've accepted it and I feel less inclined to raise my voice , much less fill the streets with random gunfire . " " The lady told me to get back at once . " " That reminds me . I 'm having some female companionship drop up later today . Maybe you 'd like to stay around and meet it . " " What 's it consist of ? " " There 's only one but she might have a sister . " " They told me to get back at once and I did n't . If you could find out for sure about the sister thing , I could try to leave the meeting early again . " " Do you like it here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole big place . " " I do n't see myself making a career out of it . " " Are you entering into things ? " " No . " " Enter into things , " Mohole said . " I do n't see it . " " Make an effort . Are you making an effort ? " " No . " " Make an effort , " he said . " That 's what I failed to do at your stage of the game and even much later . I did n't enter into things , with the result that I felt left out , consistently on the verge of snapping . I did n't make the effort . So what would happen ? I would see myself with a high-powered rifle and big boxes of ammo . I 'm standing in a window high above the street . I 'm firing wildly . I 'm shooting anything that moves . Then I 'm yelling at anyone left out there who 'll listen . I 'm a snapper ! I snapped ! It 's not my fault ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Maybe you 'd better tell me your partner preference , " Mohole said . " Whatever 's normal in my situation . "  | " Maybe you do n't want someone 's sister . There are different varieties of companionship dropping up to a place like this . " " Let 's stay with the sister thing for now . " " Tell you what let 's do , " Mohole said . " You go on back to the conferenceand I 'll contact you when I 've made arrangements . It might turn into a very unique soiree . It just happens that I 'm a paid consultant to a sex engineering outfit . Devices galore . " " I like the name . " " That 's not their name . That 's what they make . Remember not to tell anyone I 've had this place converted . No one knows who should n't know . And do n't worry if I seem to raise my voice . When I stop shoutingat you , that 's the time to worry . " He showed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every room had the same surly gleam , a waxless finish that seemed an indestructible trait rather than something adhering to the objects themselves . There were towel racks everywhere . Refrigerated air seeped from large vents in the wall . The sofas , drapes and lampshades had plastic covers labeled oMCO RESEARCH . There was no sign of the translucent inner surface of the sphere itself ; partitions had been erected as part of the renovation . An ornamental footbath graced the vomitorium . Mohole opened a cabinet and displayed his collection of " specialty scents "  --  artificial fragrances packaged in aerosol cans . Billy noted a few of the labels . " CHEESE , CRACKERS AND DRINKS . " " DINNER FOR TWO  --  SEAFOOD SERIES . " " WOOD-BURNING FIRE . " " COFFEE TABLE AURA  --  FRESH FLOWERS , CIGARETTES , AFTER-DINNER CORDIALS . " " HEAPED GARMENTS . " " BEDSHEETS AND HAND LOTION . " " NUDE FEMALE BODY ( MOIST  --  SENSE OF URGENCY SERIES . " One can was simply marked " YVONNE , YVONNE . " The suite 's seeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baronial proportions , made the boy feel slightly dislocated . But the sight of so many TV sets , all with swivel mechanisms , revived him . It was like a nineteenth-century motel , magnificent and bland , the traveler desolate in this unnatural immensity , a painless estrangement for all . " Poverty is exhausting , " Kyzyl said . " I 've seen it etched on many a face . We used to make early dawn sweeps across the urban centers ,  |p189tagging  indigents for further study . We 'd proceed forth in unmarked half-tracks and commence tagging with coded markers . These were tired people . When we speak of poverty , this is co-synonymous with extreme fatigue . Migration patterns ca n't be studied without tagging . But the average migrant indigent , even when we talk of his fatigue and his flagged-out spirits , he sometimes posed a bodily threat to the funded personnel . He with his people resisted being tagged , resisted wearing the tag , resisted the idea of tagging , the whole concept enforcement . It was a study . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers , as opposed to indigents , were too lethargic one way or the other . People who follow the sun are easy to tag and we had checkpoint activity throughout the warmer zones . But the indigentsresisted . We utilized no force or prereaction sweeps except as they applied . Applied force is sanctioned by most confederations of the destitute . This is first-hand from personal experience that we utilized only optional weaponry and never inflicted as we say incommensurate pain . Pain inflicted had to be equal to the threat to our persons . There 's a difference between exhaustion and lethargy . Exhausted people are known to be dangerous . They do n't display the torpor and stupor of people who follow the sun by the truckload , making them easy to tag . So the question of fatigue is double-edged , commingled with the languageproblem , and many experts on dialect proceeded forth into the urban enclaves to explain to the indigents that this was all a study to learn more about their migratory patterns . A funded study . But they resisted the coded markers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly armored vehicles we conversed among ourselves . How tired they seem , ' we said . " Billy realized that Kyzyl was escorting him back to his canister rather than to the large room with the bare octagonal table . This made sense , come to think . of it , because Kyzyl did n't know he was supposed to return to the Conference on Invisible Mass . Once inside , with Kyzyl waiting beyond the door , he decided in a moment of minor defiance to do some further work on the star code . He turned off the light and began to calculate , his silky pencil forming giant numbers of the plain white sheet . The videophone chimed five times . He pushed a buttonp190on the panel and the screen filled with light . There was no one there , however . The only thing he could see was a tricycle in the background , dimly . " Big B. , can you hear me ? " " Where are you ? " " It 's Endor . " " Talking from where ? " " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want you to see me . But I want you to hear . Can you do that ? " " You 're coming in weak . " " How about now ? " " Better . " " I 'm down on the floor shouting up into the talk gadget . Do n't try to see me . Do you know where I am ? " " Down on the floor . " " I mean where in what locale . " " The hobby room . " " Good guess . " " I recognized the tricycle . " " That 's where I am , all right . Walked in early this morning . Came in from the hole . Came limping through the mud and grass . I 've been digging , lad . Clawing my way down . But I wanted to take a break and come weaving in all mud-laden and scrawny for the express purpose of talking to you . You ca n't set me , can you ? " " No . " " They padlocked my room . You know that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about that ? " " I do n't know . " " Neither do I , " Endor said . " With no room of my own , I had to come up here to the so-called hobby room . At least they have n't touched my things . My things are intact . Important to have things of your own . Untouchedand intact . But there 's still the other room to think about , the real room , padlocked . We 'll have to figure something out , Big Bill , becauseeventually you 're going to want to sit in my room a spell . Thingsp191are scheduled to get worse around here . That much I know . You can count on it , although you 'll wish you had n't . " " So what do I do ? " " Sit tight and listen .

" " Eyes closed ? " " Shut tight . " " I do n't trust you , " Endor said . " I 'm going back down to the floor . On the count of three , you can open your eyes . I 'll cup my hands tighter this time . That should funnel my words up to you in the loudest death-wheeze I can manage . One two three . " " All open . " " I love to count , " the voice said .

That 's what I 'll do on the way back . Gather some pebbles . It 'll break up the trip . Also give me something to count besides fingers . What 's eighteen times eleven times twenty-three minus five hundred and one plus forty-three multiplied by two minus eight thousand one hundred and ninety-two ? "  | " Zero .

" " I know you can do tougher . " " Do you know a person or persons named Harry Braniff ? " Billy said . " Person or persons ?

I have no current status . " " Person or persons unknown , I guess . " " I lit out for the hole because I could n't break the code . What 's doing on the code , Big Bill ? The code about finished me . I grew to hate the thing and the people who devised it . Lost faith in myself . Cursed science and the natural limits of man .

I tried to break the code but the code broke me . " " I have a feeling the answer 's very simple . " " The universe is so big , lad . What are we going to do about it ? " " I do n't know . " " Neither do I , " Endor said . " A lot of it is missing , so it 's not nearly as big as it could be . The value-dark dimension . A lot of the universe is trapped in there . We ca n't find it .

" He has a whole room just for vomiting . " " The history of science is crosshatched with lines of additive and corrective thought . This is how we try to arrive at truth . Truth accumulates . It can be borrowed and paid back . We correct our predecessors , an effete form of assassination , and then we wait either in this life or the next for the corrective dagger to be slipped twixt our own meatlessribs .

The last of his strength had apparentlybeen exhausted by the requirements of the formal speech he 'd chosen to make and Billy imagined him on his back , arms and legs extended , chest pumping , warm spittle mingling in his beard with slimep196mold and the living mucus of his last meal . As time passed his cough assumed a tone of total desolation , the sound of a near bark , sufficient to define the residue of an existence . " Three plus three times two . " " Twelve . " " See you at the hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a point after which it is possible to stop digging and take the free fall . Use your imagination . That 'll tell you when to make the switch . " A long silence followed . He looked at the white tricycle on the screen . There was an electronic tremor and the picture went blank . He tried to get some work done . Endor 's visitation left him feeling puzzled , maybe in part because it was nonvisual in nature . He decided to return to the meeting . Kyzyl escorted him to the door of the conference room . Puzzled , yes , but not unhappy . He liked being called lad , particularly by a bearded person . There was something pleasantly oldfashionedabout it . " But now a new theory has been put forth , one of vast implications . " He could n't understand why anyone would wear a toupee that looked like a bowl haircut . As Bhang Pao spoke he made hand-washing gestures , each hand curling in and out of the other . Masha Simjian sucked on hard candy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his seat in the corner and worked to perfect a look of peripheral interest . Bhang Pao , in a concisely passionate narration , discussed space-time sylphed and went on to summarize the rest of Orang Mohole'srelativity theory . " The laws are not equally valid there , " he concluded . " Unpredictable events may flow from a given mohole or moholes . We do n't know precisely what sort of events . Catastrophe , natural or unnatural , ca n't be ruled out . There is one hopeful note . The message of the star gods is still in effect . All we know is that the message-senders do not live on a planet in orbit around Ratner 's star . Nevertheless they do live , they do exist , and this is cause for optimism if not unalleviated joy . " The door opened and Melcher-Speidell entered . In the midst of introductions Maidengut explained to Billy that the contributions of these two men in the field of alternate physics were so interdependent that the men themselves had come to be spoken of as a single individual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried two extra chairs to the table and everyone was seated . Billy was still in the corner . Lepro sat between Melcher-Speidell . " There 's nothing to get excited about , " Melcher said . " When you talk and talk and talk about alternate modes of physical reality , as we 've had to talk in our chosen endeavor , when you theorize and theorize , then it just seems to happen , whatever it is you 're talking about , coming as no big shock , and this too shall pass is the way you tend to react is my reaction . We 're just in the first stage . Nothing significantwill happen until we 're fully ready for it . This is the way it usually works . The idea begins to develop and spread . The thing or event becomesincreasingly conceivable in hundreds of thousands of minds . The next stage is usually frightening imminence . The thing or event becomesfrighteningly imminent . This is nothing special to get excited about and I want to say at this juncture how happy we are to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our midst in order to reassure him that his work on the mathematical content of the transmission is no longer of vital priority status . The last stage is what really matters . " " Alternate physics , if it teaches us anything , " Speidell said , " it teaches us that once you go across the line , once you 're over the line and left without your classical sources , your rational explanations , the whole of your scientific ethos , once this happens you have to pause . You have to pause as we may have to pause someday in the future . You 're over the line , sure , but that does n't mean you have to keep going or hurl yourself into the uncharted void . This is nonsense . You pause . You reflect . You get your bearings . Alternate physics , if it 's to move out of the theoretical realm , as it may have to one day , I guarantee you , with a vengeance , and into areas of direct application , must give us the bearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must soothe and support . We 've come to an exciting time . Let 's take the positive view and emphasize the challenge . I 'm excited about this . I want to communicatemy excitement but do n't know how . I have my individual peculiarities . Things I cherish about myself . Private parts of me . I 'm introspective . Fond of adults . Collect fruit and pennies . Like to take long walks on the beach . No better place to walk , incidentally . Sandp198toughens the calf muscles . You need this in the hypothetical sciences . " " Why or because is it , " Lepro said , " that the number one speaker here to my right hand says in his own words nothing to get excited about and this is followed upon by my left hand here , who , why or because of the positive challenge , says excitement , excitement . Is this difference why or because of basic disagreement on essentials or why or because of semantics ? Who accepts semantics , those of us at the table , omitting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or because not . I answer why or because it 's too good to be true , that 's why or because not . The beach is a diversion . On my left brings in his beach why or because he wants to keep us from thinking of the issue itself , which is that the sky above may be getting funny . " The one-way priority phone buzzed loudly . Simjian went to the panel , picked up the telephone , listened for a few seconds , sourly , and then turned toward Billy . " It 's for you again . A man who says he does n't want to give his name but says you 'll know who he is by the message . I 'll try to repeatthe message word for word as he relays it , although for the life of me I do n't know why we should have to keep interrupting this conference in order to take messages for someone who 's merely sitting in . Double companionship not feasible . But can be simulated repeat simulated . Finger-feelies , sensitizers , inflatable vulvettes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop , soft lights and special scents , stop , promise memorable moments to all who dare yield to their burgeoning teenage sensuality , stop , all happening in my apartments atop the you-know-where . Discuss with no one repeat no one . ' " " I do n't accept the call . " " That voice sounded familiar , " Simjian said . " Was that who I think it was ? " " Yes . " " Because if it was , he 's famous for his personal sleaziness . " " He 's completely self-taught . " " Not to mention the tasteless events he likes to host , " she said . " Degenerate ceremonies featuring objects and gadgets that mock our bodies . "  | " Speaking of ceremonies , " Maidengut said , " I have some depressing news for almost everyone here . A torch-lighting ceremony is scheduled for the Great Hall . Tomorrow at dusk . All thirty-two of the resident Nobel laureates are supposed to be in attendance . " " What 's depressing about that ? " Simjian said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ask me . They might have included some of the rest of us . " " I 've never seen a torch-lighting ceremony , " Bhang Pao said . " I assumethey light torches and hand them out . The torches are doubtless prelighted as a safety precaution and then everyone participating surely advances in a slow-moving line as the torches are handed out . After that I suspect everyone stands solemnly in place , holding his or her lighted torch as the ceremony unfolds . " " What 's the ceremony all about ? " Billy said . " I bet it has something to do with the aborigine . " " What aborigine ? " Maidengut said . " The white-haired aborigine . The nameless one . Somebody saw him this morning lurking around . I thought maybe they found him and wanted to do something nice , to show what they thought of him , the way he whirled . " " It 's for Ratner , " Maidengut said . " They 're honoring Ratner . " " I did n't know there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States . His first visit here . Got the Nobel Prize for physics when he was a fairly young man and that was a long , long time ago . Wonderful occasion , really , even if they insist on restricting it . A great man . The Great Hall . Ratner himself . " Melcher-Speidell got up and left . The others soon followed  --  all but Maidengut and the boy . The former sat heavily entrenched , solidifying his relationship with the chair . He seemed to be waiting for a conclusiveremark to be made or final question to be asked before he either left the room or fell through the chair and the floor beneath it . Billy paused at the door . " The Ratner of Ratner 's star ? " " The very same , " Maidengut said . This brief exchange completed , Kyzyl escorted the boy back to his canister.  | He passed through twillig-shaped openings in the air , an infinite series of discrete convenient gateways . Nobody seemed to know where the Great Hall was . He went to a nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatch chart " ) for word of a torch-lighting ceremony . No word . No sign of Ratner 's name . No directions to Great Hall . He read the lone note pinned there.  |p201Vintage  art films  --  8 millimeter Sale or rent1  --  " Two in a Tub " 2  --  " Aunt Polly 's Banana Surprise " 3  --  " What the Butler Did " 4  --  " Volleyball Follies " 5  --  " Frenchy and the House Dick " Contact O. Mohole Maternity SuiteBy appointment onlyHe walked along a semicircular corridor , asking directions in vain , met in fact with squinted eyes and little sniffles , everyone reacting to this entity the Great Hall in similar fashion , civilized pygmies asked to climb sequoia trees , something ancestral in their replies , a captive skepticism shading every face . Eventually he came to a moving walkway ( " linear glide " ) and stepped on . He 'd never ridden on one of the linear glides , although he 'd seen them once or twice in different parts of the building . It was a pleasant experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving strap above your head . The strap , similar to the kind found in subways , was suspended from a flexible-strength wire that enabled you to pull it down to suit your particular stature . Only moments earlier he 'd imagined he was moving through air-gaps cut to his shape , an infinite number of distinct apertures . Now , on the linear glide , he felt he was passing through one continuous hole . Preciselyhis height and width . A custom perforation . Even a special opening to accommodate his raised right arm . He moved in a straight line through a dim midevening monochrome , a kind of interior dusk , abstract murals on either side . At one point a large figure , adumbral and shapeless , was superimposed on the geometry of walls and ceiling . Unerringly rendered shapes and amorphous overshadow . What was there about these surfaces that made the journey seem descendent and led him to believe he was breathing sheerest calculus ? Strict precision strict . Down the line to dream the subliminal blend of number and function . Analysis rethought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the continuous torsional spring of analysis . Atomism and flow . Down the line past history 's black on white . Ideal of proof ideal . Every semirecluse has his amaranthine woman . Imaginary love-liesbleeding . " But in this case , " Softly had written , " the woman was not only real but a mathematician as well . This is Sonja Kowalewski and we can only guess at the levels of intensity during those afternoons when she arrives at his home for lessons . Twenty years old to his fiftyfive . Aristocratic and social , while he is accustomed to life in remote villages . To someone fixed in solitude she must have seemed a brighter presence than he could bear . She is brilliant , attractive , Moscow-born , an Eastern jade ( it is suspected ) determined to have her pick of the schoolmaster 's gifts . So we speculate on the density of their meetings .

Does she have fantasies about mathematics ? Does she imagine that in his attacks of vertigo he spins from room to room , a scientist trying to cope with holiness , or perhaps himself immune , a germ-carrier of ecstasy ? She titles a mathematical memoir : On the Rotation of a Solid Body About a Fixed Point . They pass their afternoons and when she dies ( surprise ) he burns her letters . " Of , pertaining to , or resembling the amaranth . An imaginary flower that never fades . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glide continued to move . The hole was about as tall and wide as he was . He stepped off the glide just as it whispered through the darkened arch . Adjacent to this opening was a door with a black arrow painted on it . The arrow pointed down . He opened the door and went down a flight of old stone steps , cracked in many places . The lighting consisted of a makeshift network of low-watt bulbs strung along the ceiling . He camep203to the bottom of the vertical shaft around which the staircase had been constructed . There was a large jagged hole in one wall and next to the hole stood a man with a plastic torch in his hand , flames two feet high . " I 'm Evinrude , " he said . " You 're very , very late . " " Is this the ceremony ? " " They 're working out size places and they want the smallest last . that 's the only thing that saved you . " But this is the ceremony for Ratner , right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask if you 're a laureate . " " Yes . " " In what field ? " " Mathematics . " " Because only laureates are allowed beyond this point , " Evinrude said . " Zorgs . I won for zorgs . " " What 's that ? " " A class of numbers . " " Out of curiosity , would I know what you were talking about if you described them further ? " " No . " " Can people do things with these numbers of yours ? " " The average person , forget about , but in his book-to-be , right where I 'm up to now , Softly says zorgs in their own way hark back to the nineteenth-century redefinition of the ancient and semimystical idea of whole numbers forming the basis of all mathematics . They hark back , he says . Softly can be funny that way . " " Who or what is Softly ? " " Head of the School of Mathematics at the Center for the Refinementof Ideational Structures . " " Correct , " Evinrude said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would n't give him one to carry , particularly if the ceremony was scheduled to be a long one . " What happens next ? " he said . " I ask you why you 're late . " " Nobody could tell me how to get here . I asked everybody I saw andp204none of them ever even heard of the Great Hall . It 's not that I did n't ask . They just never heard . " " No wonder they never heard of it , " Evinrude said . " You gave them the wrong name . It 's not the Great Hall . It 's the Great Hole . Whoever told you Great Hall was guilty of a misnomer . This is the old part of Field Experiment Number One . The building was partly built on an existing structure . Not many people know that . The old structure was buried , and so instead of destroying it or bypassing it they incorporated the old part into what they were putting up , a buttress for the foundation , because of the archaeology involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old part . The temple cave . They still have n't figured out how to make it disasterproof . A sudden noise or loud report could bring it all down . " " What 's this about size places ? " " It 's to get a dramatic effect with the torches . " " We all hold torches ? " " The laureates , " Evinrude said . " All the laureates get a torch and go to their size places and then light the torch and hold it . " " Why are they having the ceremony down here ? " " Ratner 's people . " " What kind of people ? " " The doctor , the nurse , the organist , the fella from the bearded sect . They insisted on having the ceremony in the Great Hole because of first of all there 's the old gentleman 's health to be considered and the air down here is the right kind of air and because of second of all there 's a sense of the past in the Great Hole because of its being part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered , awareness of past , respect for heritage . The laureates agreed . Those that were consulted . " " I was n't consulted . " " You were very , very late . Maybe that 's why you were n't consulted . Ratner 's people were n't late . They came thousands of miles but they got here on time . " " They were n't told Great Hall instead of Great Hole . " " Time to go in , " Evinrude said . " Step lively , keep it moving , spread it out . "  |p205He  dipped the torch and Billy stepped through the hole and walked down a flight of crooked stairs into a small dusty room with nothing in it but a bronze door and a stone bench . He sat on the bench and looked at the door . The particles in the air reminded him of chalk dust and he assumed all this powdery matter had simply floated off the walls and ceiling , further indications of the structure 's fragility and age . The door opened , admitting a man wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard was white and untrimmed , reaching to his chest , and although its wispy attenuated ends made the boy think of surgical cotton sticking out of a box after a handful has been removed , he was sure on second glance that the beard was anything but soft , that its strands were coarse , firm and wiry , toughened by decades of misery and grit . The man 's coat extended almost to his shoes . He approached the bench and Billy moved over to give him room to sit but the man stopped short of the bench , put his hands behind his back and leaned forward slightly , head inclined , lips beginning to move a few seconds before he actually said anything . " The old gentleman wants you to present the roses . " " I thought you were the old gentleman . " " I 'm Pitkin , who advises on the writings . I 'm looking at the person he picked by hand to present him the roses face to face . He 's one sweetheart of a human being . I advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out of me with hot tongs , I 'd tell them I learn more from Shazar Ratner than I could ever teach if I live to be  --  go ahead , name me a figure . " " A hundred . " " Name me higher . " " A hundred and fifty . " " Stop there , " Pitkin said . " Many years ago he came back to his roots . Eastern Parkway . Strictness like you would n't believe . But the old gentleman he was tickled to get back . " " What kind of strictness ? " " The codes , the rules , the laws , the customs , the tablecloth , the silverware , the dishes . " " So then you 're from Brooklyn , if your roots are Eastern Parkway.  |p206I  'm surprised I never heard of the old gentleman , being from the metropolitanarea myself . " " He 's a living doll , " Pitkin said . " After you present the roses he has a word or two he wants to whisper up to you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling . The others he would n't give you two cents for the whole bunch . Science ? He turned his back on science . Sciencemade him a household word , a name in the sky , but he grew world-weary of it . He returned to the wellspring to drink . They assigned me then and there . I know the writings . Many years ago , long before a kid like you was even formed out of smelly mush in his mother 's tubes , I committed the writings to memory . They do n't know this , the other elders , because we 're not supposed to memorize . It 's considered cheating when you memorize . When you memorize you lose the inner meaning . But how else could a dumbbell like me become an elder ? Name me a way and I 'll do it . Just between us chickens I did a little cheating . So what 's the damage ? Show me who I harmed . Once in a while I sneak another look or two to refresh myself . But only once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 're my sworn witness who I 'm looking at . If I 'm lying , may both your eyes drip vengeful pus . " " Why my eyes ? " " Because that 's the oath , " Pitkin said . " I did n't word the oath . Go ask who worded it why your eyes . " " It must go way back , an oath like that , to when they believed in exact cruelty to each other 's parts of the body . Eye for eye . Tooth for tooth . " " You know the writings ? " " Just something I heard . " " To where did the old gentleman return to drink ? " " He returned to the wellspring to drink . " " We all memorize . The memory is there , so where 's the harm in using it ? Here I depart from the other elders . The elders say interpret the writings . Find the inner meanings . Seek the sacred rays from the world of emanations . The writings say the same thing . But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interpret . You should pardon me but it 's true . Pitkin memorizes . If you can name me one thing wrongp207with this that I have n't already figured out for myself , I 'll take off all my clothes and walk naked through Crown Heights . " " I 've heard of it . " " So show a little mercy to someone whose whole life has been awe , fear and kilt . " " Kilt ? " " Innocence and kilt . " " You mean guilt . Awe , fear and guilt . There , that makes sense . You said kilt . ' But it 's definitely pronounced guilt . " " A corrector I got in front of me . I need this from a peewee quiz kid ? This kind of talk I need from someone that I do n't even know if his little shvontzie got trimmed by the knife ? " " One second please . " " Inches away from a filthy urinator and I have to listen to my spellingcorrected by some smart aleck in arithmetic ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filthy-impure , not filthy-dirty . Ritual filth , the worst kind . One thing I want to tell you even if it breaks my heart giving advice to a speller . A little advice free of charge straight from the mystical writings . You ready for this ? Quiz kid , corrector , you want to be instructed from the writings or you want to go through life waving your shvontzie like a monkey ? " " I 'm listening . " " Learn some awe and fear . " " Is that it ? " " White monkey , speller , keep your business out of other people 's noses . " Billy began to imagine that under the beard and heavy dark clothes was a young fellow arrayed in the latest resort finery , a slick casual warm-up act who would end his comic routine by dressing up in shabby clothes , sticking on a beard and stepping out in Pitkin 's skin to do some involuted patter about ghetto life in stone-age Brooklyn . " What did I say you should learn ? " " Some awe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nurse entered . The doctorp208held a huge syringe and the nurse was wheeling a device that consisted of a gallon bottle of colorless fluid and a thin black hose that extended from the bottle through a Pyrex vessel ( filled with a semisolid material ) and into a small clear cylindrical container . Paying no attention to the old man and boy , the doctor began to fill the syringe with fluid processed through the hose , vessel and tube . It was a complicated procedure and the doctor and nurse slapped at each other 's hands , although with no animosity , whenever a faulty move was made . " Some doctor , " Pitkin whispered . " Only the worst cases he takes . If he sees you in the street having a heart attack , he walks right by . Tell him it 's a tsetse fly in your lungs , if you 're lucky he 'll stop . He makes so much money you could n't count that high . A house with grounds . Two big doors , front and back . A toaster that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prostatectomy . Uses a colored nurse . See her ? With the tube in her hand ? Colored . Walk in any hospital right off the street and that 's what you see . Uniforms , shoes , folded hats . Like anybody . Only colored . A total specialist , Dr. Bonwit . The old gentlemanswears by him . Only because of Bonwit he came for the torches all this way . With Bonwit along he 's willing to travel . Round trip we 're paying . Ratner , Bonwit , Pitkin , the organ player , the colored nurse . We took up collections in the neighborhood . This is the respect people have for the name Ratner both before and after he turned his back . " " It 's a back problem ? " " Turned his back on science . " " What 's wrong with him then to make him have to travel with a doctor ? " " Not just a doctor please . A specialist . Never please say doctor to his face . You do n't know this ? What am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tell me to watch out for ? Pisher , where should you keep your business out of ? " " Other people 's noses . " " A little awe and fear never hurt anybody . " " But what 's the old gentleman suffering from ? " " Look it up , " Pitkin said . " Turn to any page in the medical book and there he is . Swollen tooth sockets . Brown eye . Urinary leakage.  |p209hardening  of the ducts . Hormone discolor . Blocked extremities . Seepage from the gums . The wind is bad . The lungs are on the verge . Bonwit gives the lungs two weeks . There 's no breathing except shallow labored . The lungs , the lungs . " " What kind of wind ? " " Intestinal and digestive . Mixed wind . A little of each . " " What else ? " " The skin , the bones , " Pitkin said . " They must love him at Blue Cross . " " How are you behaving that I said you should n't behave like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I looking at here ? " " A pisher . " " Moistness , " Pitkin said . " His whole body is moist . The doctor , you should see him , night and day he works to keep it dry . Dedication at that price is worthless . You need heavy machines to keep a man alive . The face , the mouth . " Pitkin 's lips continued to move and Billy wondered exactly how old this man Ratner must be if his advisor on the writings thought it suitable to refer to him as the old gentleman  --  an advisor with white hair growingout of his face at beard level and even above , crowding the eyes , and with lips that started moving before he spoke and did not stop until well after he was finished talking . Dr. Bonwit walked out now , syringe properly filled , and the nurse followed , wheeling the elaborate device . " Is that for the old gentleman ? " " Nonclotting silicone , " Pitkin said . " He does n't like to see them fill up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do it there . Needles , who can look ? " " Did n't I hear something once about silicone that has to do with bigger breasts ? " " Watch with the language in front of an elder . " " Yes or no , are they injecting his breasts ? " " Get out from here . " " What for ? " " With language like that you address an elder ? "  | " I 'm only asking . " " Get out from here . " " I do no wrong . " " They 're injecting his face , " Pitkin said . " His face collapsed coming over the ocean last night . A storm like nobody 's business . Eagles on their hats they had to fly right into it . So now Bonwit builds up the face with a little shot . Poof , it fills right out . This is instant silicone , according to Bonwit , that fills you out , that coats the lining , that heats up the tissue and makes the moisture run off that 's making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No clotting . He recommends . " " Not just for anybody . " " What can I say ? He recommends . This is from his own words , Bonwit , that I memorized . With strictness like we got , who would n't memorize ? This I ask . You 're looking at an asker . If they put hot tongs on my body I might admit I could use another chance . Maybe with a second chance I could learn to interpret . Maybe it 's less impossible than I think , dumbbell or not . But I 'm asking who did I hurt but myself ? An old man asks . True , I did a little cheating . I memorized here and there . I did n't look for the inner meanings . For years I 'm sweating bullets over this thing . If they said I could have another chance I 'd walk naked in the rush hour through a colored subway car . This I vow on a holy oath . If I 'm lying , may you inherit a hotel with ten thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These oaths are pretty dangerous to people just standing around listening . " " I did n't word them . They were worded five thousand years ago . You want to change the wording , go complain . Tell them Pitkin sent you . I 'm in enough trouble with the cheating like a hot coal on my heart so I ca n't sleep at night , I might as well have that too , my name on a complaintby some pipsqueak speller from off the street . This is what happenswith strictness . It has awe built in . The more you cheat , the greater the fear . Where 's the impunity in this world ? " " Just do n't start in with the vengeful pus . " " An oath is an oath . " " You do n't have to use the worst ones . "  | " It 's time to present the roses , " Pitkin said . They went through the bronze door , past the instant silicone apparatusand down several flights of stairs that seemed even older and more damaged than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music below , a reverberating cavern-sized snore , and he followed Pitkin through a slit in the wall and out into the Great Hole , a vast undergroundchamber largely in a natural state ( cool stone surfaces ) but includingremnants of ancient architecture ( columns , half-walls , part of a platform ) as well as elements of recent installation ( fluorescent lightingand structural reinforcement ) . The lights were suspended from large portable appliances that resembled clothing racks . The organ , which was Endor 's , the same neon pipe organ Billy had seen in the hobby room , was set on an outcropping of rock in a far corner . Aside from Pitkin , the only people he saw at the moment were the organist , now playing the kind of intermission music featured at hockey games , and the old gentleman 's doctor , heading directly toward Pitkin . The two men exchanged a few words and then the bearded advisor disappeared into a dim hollow about thirty yards away . Listening to the organ , Billy recalled Evinrude 's remark about a loud noise bringing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of as something readily subject to being brought down . " The old gent may or may not make it , " Bonwit said . " One advantage is the air down here , crystal clear , a beautiful purifying agent for the biomembrane . Now here 's how we 'll work it . The laureates are in the antecave off the Great Hole and they 're being instructed in torch manipulation . You do n't join them until they file in and Sandow gives you a hand signal . Sandow 's the man at the organ . After he gives the hand signal , the biomembrane is wheeled in by Pitkin and Georgette from that shadowy area with me leading the way . Then Sandow makes the opening remarks and the pigeons are released . " " When do I present the roses ? " " After the pigeons , " Bonwit said . " What 's this biomembrane that 's being wheeled in ? " " It 's what keeps old Ratner alive . Ultrasterile biomedical membrane environment . This is the prototype model , fully operational but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system that grew out of the traceelementisolator used to keep lab animals germ-free . The old gentleman never leaves . This is the only nonhostile environment we could work out for him considering his state of deterioration . The bacterial count is zero . There are double airlocks for air current control . Pressure is regulated and there 's automatic oxygen therapy when his system needs a jolt . It 's even got a vapor duct to cut down the chance of self-infection . If he begins to fail , Georgette raises the shield and I crawl in and operate . The biomembrane is a self-sterilizing operating theater in miniature and it adapts to a postoperative therapy center , he should live so long , as the saying goes . " " Is Sandow a laureate ? " " Sandow is an organist , " the doctor said . " I was told laureates only . I can understand an MD and a nurse and even a person who reads from the writings . But if it 's all laureates , why move that organ all the way down from where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe he did win and only plays the organ on the side . " " Unless they give a Nobel Prize for pedaling , he did n't win . But it adds to the mood , an organ . I for one do n't mind him around . It makes for more pomp , having an organ . LaMar T. Sandow at the keyboard . ' Besides he 's the old gent 's lifelong friend . You want a friend to see you honored . I 'm all for an organ at a function like this . It supplies a heady tone . " " What do you specialize in ? " " Everything , " the doctor said . Pitkin returned , bent and shuffling , a bouquet of white roses in his arms . " The colored nurse told me to tell you the face filled out . " " Good , " Bonwit said . " I made believe I did a little reading . I gave a good show . It made , him teary around the nose . Thick green nose-blow runs out of his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What do you think of having an organ ? " Bonwit said . " We already got one . What , you want two ? " " Just want to know what you think . Fielding a few ideas . "  | " Why , somebody 's against it ? " " That 's right . " " Wait , let me guess . " " You want to give me the flowers ? " Billy said . " Against the organ , who could it be ? Which person for his size makes the biggest corrections ? Tell me if I 'm warm if I move toward the speller . " " It belongs to Endor . They should have left it where it was . " Sandow broke off the intermission music and began playing a triumphalmarch . Pitkin handed Billy the flowers and went back to the dark corner , this time accompanied by Dr. Bonwit . The laureates started tiling in , thirty-one of them , in size places . Multicolored neon , flashing intermittently , pulsed through the clear tubing that extended well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were as large as the one Evinrude had used to light the way into the original jagged hole . Althoughstill unlit , the torches were being held as if each one were about to cough forth an assortment of fresh lava ; that is , the laureates kept the plastic devices well away from their bodies , every head averted . They seemed to march accompanied by a terrible belief in their own potential for self-immolation . It passed methodically down the line , a bland handshake , freezing them to their processional drag-step . The small parade came to a halt as Sandow lifted his hands from the keyboard and spun himself to the end of the bench , looking directly at Billy . Echoes of the organ music collided high above the floor of the Great Hole . Sandow tapped his right hand twice on the inside of his left thigh . This , it turned out , was only the first of two signals and he followed it with a little wiggle of the thumb . Billy , with the flowers , took his place at the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand signal had been meant for him ( get in line ) and the second for the doctor , the nurse and Pitkin ( wheel in the biomembrane ) , for at this ' , moment a massive transparent tank came into view . Its basic shape was simple : a cylinder on wheels , a blunt-nosed torpedo set lengthwise on a metal undercasing to which were fixed four scooter-sized tires . Dr. Bonwit walked ahead of the biomembrane , kicking small stones out of the way , and behind it were Pitkin and the nurse , pushing . Everywhere an the ten-foot-long tank were complex monitoring devices and all sortsp214of gauges , tubes and switches . It was by far the most elaborate health mechanism Billy had ever seen and he stood on his toes to get a look at Ratner himself but the angle was n't favorable just then . What he could see , clearly , were a half-dozen large bright sponsor decals and stickers on both sides of the biomembrane and even on the blunt front end . Corporate names , brand names , slogans and symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The breath you take is the life we save " BIZENE POLYTHENE COATINGUDGA inspected and approvedWALKER  --  ATKINSON METALIZED UNDERSURFACESFrom the folks at Uniplex SyntelEVALITE CHROME PANELING The glamour name in surgical suppliesDREAMAWAYBed linen , mattress and frameA division of OmCo Research " Building a model world " Sandow stood before the organ on the natural rock shelf and waited for the bearded man and the nurse to stop wheeling . When they did , all was quiet except for an underground stream nearby and the last sobbing echo of the triumphal march barely reaching them from a distant surface of the huge cavern . Sandow , a balding thickset man , wore a sort of Oriental smile , a pained look subtly altered by decades of erosion . " I 'd like to open my remarks by reaffirming my friendship with the old gentleman despite going our separate ways more than twenty-five years ago due to clashing ideologies , which explains my presence here symbolic of a coming together , a **27;2853;TOOLONG , and what a setting it is , ladies and gentlemen , a basilica if I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the relics of an unknown civilization these many feet down to light our torches in tribute to thisp215gentle soul of science , who , when we were young men , he and I , espoused all there was to espouse in those benighted days of the principles of scientific humanism , including , as I recall , individual freedom , democracy for all peoples , a ban on nationalism and war , no waiting for a theistic deity to do what we ourselves could do as enlightened men and women joined in our humanistic convictions , the right to get divorced ; but who , as I understand it , has now returned to the ideas and things from which so many of us were so eager to flee , proving , I suppose , that there 's a certain longevity to benightedness , and I wo n't take up the time here providing you with a list of this great ex-scientist 's current convictions beyond mentioning the secret power of the alphabet , the unnamable name , the literal contraction of the superdivinity , fear of sperm demons ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coming together but a going away in a way , for having come to science and humanism , so has he gone , and in lieu of an eternal flame , which I had hoped to borrow for the occasion , we are here to light our torches to Shazar Lazarus Ratner , reasoning what better way to honor this man , this scientific giant , than to have the Nobelists light their torches from an eternal flame , which I 'd wanted to get flown in from one of the nations in or near the cradle of civilization , simply borrowingthe flame and returning it after the ceremony and they could bill us at their convenience but I was wary of pressure groups and I foresaw the remark from someone in such a group saying cradle of whose civilization , ' for there is always this prejudice against Western civilizationhaving its own cradle and calling it the cradle when other peoples have their own ideas of where the cradle is and even whether or not there is a cradle as we employ the term , being merely self-descriptive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none of which , as I thank you for your time and attention , has any bearing on the pigeons . " Apparently reacting to a prearranged word or phrase , one of the laureates stepped out of the line and approached a crate that was set beneath the natural stage where the organ was located . " The pigeons , " Sandow said . " Let us release the pigeons . The releasingof the pigeons , ladies and gentlemen . " The man raised the top of the box and about fifty pigeons came shakngout , like a series of knots unraveling on a single line , and flewp216toward the top of the cavern , veering just before they got there into an opening in the rock wall , merely a whisper now . " The presenting of the roses , " Sandow said . " The boy steps up to the great medico-engineering feat and symbolically presents the roses . " Billy strode to the tank and was lifted in the air by Dr. Bonwit and held standing on the curved surface of the transparent shield . Below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deep white . The doctor stood on one side of the tank , the nurse on the other , and together they supported Billy as he displayed the flowers for the benefit of the old gentleman . " Ratner sees the roses , " Sandow said . " The old gentleman acknowledgesthe floral bouquet . " The doctor and nurse lowered Billy to a straddling position on the tank . Bonwit turned a dial , activating a chambered device set into the clear shield directly over Ratner 's face and about a foot from Billy 's crotch . Immediately a bit of static was emitted from the interior of the biomembrane , apparently the sound of Ratner breathing through the bacteria-filtered talk chamber . " The boy prepares to listen to the circulated words , " Sandow said . Bonwit took the flowers and inserted them in a sort of scabbard at the side of the biomembrane . Without the bouquet Billy was able to settle into a more comfortable straddling position . On his back Ratner looked directly into the boy 's face . In a gesture of respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear the old gentleman'sremarks . He was in fact neither eager nor respectful but the occasionseemed to demand gestures . Ratner wore a black beret and a long fringed prayer shawl that covered him from shoulders to feet . " The old man speaks to the boy , " Sandow said . " Sunk in misery and disease he speaks actual words to the little fellow on the tank . " The small ancient face was glazed like artificial fruit . The beret , however , gave the old man a semblance of heroic bearing . His arms were crossed on his chest , baby fists curled . What Pitkin had referred to as nose-blow was indeed being discharged from Ratner 's eyes . Fortunatelyjust a trickle . Far corner of each eye . Slowly the withered lips parted and the old man spoke.  | " The universe , what is it ? " " I do n't know . " " It began with a point . The point expanded so that darkness took up the left , light the right . This was the beginning of distinctions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be room for the universe to fit . So the en-sof contracted . This made room . The creator , also known as G-dash-d , then made the point of pure energy that became the universe . In science this is what they call the big bang . Except for my money it 's not a case of big bang versus steady state . It 's a case of big bang versus little bang . I vote for little . Matter was so dense it could barely explode . The explosion barely got out . This was the beginningif you 're speaking as a scientist . The fireball got bigger , the temperature fell , the galaxies began to form . But it almost never made it . There was such density . Matter was packed in like sardines . When it finally exploded , you almost could n't hear it . This is science . As a scientist my preference is definitely little bang . As a whole man I believe in the contraction of the en-sof to make room for the point . " Billy raised his head and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He votes for little bang , " he said . " The noise was muffled . " Then he crouched over the biomembrane as Ratner prepared to speak once again . " The en-sof is the unknowable . The hidden . The that-which-is-notthere . The neither-cause-nor-effect . The G-dash-d beyond G-dash-d . The limitless . The **52;2882;TOOLONG . Yet it emanates . It reveals itself through its attributes , the sefiroth . G-dash-d is the first of the ten sefirothic emanations of the en-sof . Without the en-sof 's withdrawl or contraction , there could be no point , no cosmic beginning , no universe , no G-dash-d . I learned this not long after I looked through my first telescope growing up as a boy in Brooklyn . But I failed to understand at that time . " Ratner paused here , apparently to regain his strength , and Billy glanced toward the others and made another capsule report , as he assumed they wished him to do , having traveled from every part of the world to be here for the ceremony.  | " No universe without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non believing . " He turned his attention to Ratner once more . The lacquered face was unevenly puffy . Where teeth were missing , the inflamed sockets had bulged to the point of convexity , leaving a mouth divided between shaky teeth and burnt-out gummy nubs . Finally the old man 's voice resembled a wind-up toy 's , metallic and unreal , but Billy did n't know whether this was the result of his physical condition or the purifying action of the electronic talk chamber . " We come from the stars , " Ratner said . " Our chemicals , our atoms , these were first made in the centers of old stars that exploded and spread their remains across the sky eventually to come together as the sun we know and the planet we inhabit . I started out with binoculars , viewing the sky . It seemed remarkable to a boy like me , underfed and pale , with a small mental vista , that there was something bigger than Brooklyn . In those days of no television , the stars could be awesome to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , growing up , with binoculars . Later I got a telescope , my first , bought from a junk dealer , with a tripod , borrowed , and I stuck it out the window , top floor , and gazed for hours . Star fields , clusters , the moon . I read books , I learned , I gazed . Knowledge made me punch my fists against the walls in awe and shame . Our atoms were formed in the dense interiors of supergiant stars billions of years ago . Stars millions of times more luminous than our sun . They broke down and decayed and began to cool . Atoms from these stars are in our bones and nervous systems . We 're stellar cinders , you and me . . This is science , poeticized here and there , and this you can compare with the kabbalistic belief that every person has a sun inside him , a radiant burst of energy . Try to reach a mystical state without radiant energy and see what happens . " " Secondhand telescope , " Billy said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're made of them . Pale and thin for his age . " " When I go into mystical states , " Ratner said , " I pass beyond the opposites of the world and experience only the union of these opposites in a radiant burst of energy . I call it a burst . What else can I call it ?  |p219You  should n't think it 's really a burst . Everything in the universe works on the theory of opposites . To see what it looks like outside the universe , you have to go into a trance or two . According to Pitkin , G-dash-d could live anywhere . He does n't need the universe . He could ttct up headquarters east or west of the universe and not miss a thing . But this is Pitkin . A rare attempt to interpret . The mystical writings . The mystical oral traditions . The mystical interpretations , oral and written . These exist beneath the main body of thought and thinking . You do n't go into a trance reading the everyday writings . The hidden texts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . " Billy looked at the laureates , then shrugged from his position atop the shield . " Written , oral , " Ratner said . " Black , white . Male , female . Let 's hear you name some more . " " Day , night . " " Very good . " " Plus , minus . " " Even better , " Ratner said . " Remember , all things are present in all other things . Each in its opposite . " Billy turned and shrugged once more . " I gazed constantly , learning , a young man , top floor still , gaining weight . Finally I realized a portable telescope no longer suited my needs and aspirations . I married a woman whose father had a house with a backyard . I thought here I could build what I truly needed , a ten-inch reflector with rotating dome . So with his permission and blessing we moved into his house . " " In the desert , I bet , for the clear air . " " In Pittsburgh , " Ratner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped me , my wife , grinding the mirror , assembling the mount , measuring and cutting wood , sending away for instructions , pasting and hammering . I started to accumulate academic degrees , to go beyond amateur ranking . All that reading , it was paying off . I continued to gaze . It was awful , Pittsburgh , in those days . Smoke , soot , particles of every description . There was a steel mill two blocks away . I had to gaze between shifts . Many times Halvah 's father tried to read to mep220from the writings . I paid no attention , acquiring my degrees , corresponding with leading minds in the sciences and technologies . He would hum as he read , a sound of piety , fear and shame . Smoke came pouring over the backyard . Thick black ash fell all over the dome . I had to stand on a chair and sweep off the top with a broom . I gazed whenever possible , I ate the cooking , I corresponded with the leading minds . Sometimes I punched the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical world . My father-in-law hummed , Fish , my father-inlaw . I asked Halvah what kind of writings these were that her father never ceased to read from . I said Halvah what writings are these ? I inquired of her what manner of writings her father so incessantly read . The mystical writings , she said . I resilvered the mirror , these being the days before widespread aluminum . He tried to give me instructions , Fish , in the secrecy of things , the hiddenness , the buried nature . Did I listen or did I sit in my dome , rotating , gazing , an occasional belch from the food ? " Billy reported to the others : " Telescope in a dome in the backyard . Marriage to the man 's daughter owning the house . Science pays off . He gazes between shifts . " The metallic lilt of Ratner 's voice , when again he spoke , seemed to possess an extra shading , a suggestion of querulous tremor . " You know what you remind me of ? " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the story , " the old man said . " Do n't think I ca n't hear that you 're reporting only science , leaving out the mystical content , which they could use a little exposure to , those laureates with their half a million Swedish kronor . It was less in my day . And do n't think I did n't notice all that shrugging when I was saying black-white , male-female , a little bit of everything present in its opposite . Because I noticed . " " Some things are hard to summarize . " " Give the whole picture , " Ratner said . " I 'll do better . " " If you want to repeat , repeat both sides . " " From now on you 'll see improvement . "  | " How many sefirothic emanations did the en-sof emanate ? " " Ten , " Billy said . " In words , what can we say about the en-sof ? " " I do n't know . " " Something or nothing ? " " Nothing . " " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A hidden essence . A truth beneath the truth . What is the true name of G-dash-d ? How many levels of unspeakability must we penetrate before we arrive at the true name , the name of names ? Once we arrive at the true name , how many pronunciations must we utter before we come to the secret , the hidden , the true pronunciation ? On what allotted day of the year , and by which of the holiest of scholars , will the secret pronunciation of the name of names be permitted to be passed on to the worthiest of the initiates ? And how passed on ? Over water , in darkness , naked , by whispers ? I sat in my dome , rotating , knowing nothing of this . Nor of the need to exercise the greatest caution in all aspects of this matter . Substitution , abbreviation , blank spaces , utter silence . The alphabet , the integers . Triangles , circles , squares . Indirection , numerology , acronyms , sighs . Not according to Pitkin , however . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not one ounce of deviation . Interpretationis n't one of his strong points , Pitkin . He 's not so good , Pitkin , when it comes to interpreting . " Ratner 's toy voice hissed and crackled through the chambered slot . The laureates were silent , standing in size places . Pitkin sat nearby on a large stone , silent , one hand covering most of his face , the mink fedora well back on his head , legs crossed and white flesh showing between the top of his black socks and his hitched-up trousers . The doctor and nurse were silent , respectfully set back about ten yards from the biomembrane , one on each side . Sandow was sitting on the edge of the organ bench , silent . Somewhere beneath them the hidden stream moved over smooth rock , making a faint smacking sound . From the boy 's viewpointthe decals on either side of the tank appeared to be lettered in reverse . He looked closely at the old gentleman , tiny inside his prayer shawl , face gleaming with polymerized sweat.  | " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here you find the contradictions joined and harmonized . This is a good place to look for the secrets you did n't even know existed . If you think I 'm lying , knock once on top of the tank . " " I do not knock . " " The writings have a substructure , a secret element of the divine . Kabbalists delving into esoteric combinations of letters widened the meaning of particular texts . I allowed this much to flow from Fish 's lips , progressing as a man , winning prizes in the sciences , sharing the marriagebed with my Halvah , stinky feet or not , ashes raining down . The way Fish hummed as he read . It began to get to me . What is there in these writings , I asked myself , that this man should hum ? A noise of shame , fear and humiliation , my Halvah 's father 's humming . I refitted the tracks under the dome so it could rotate more smoothly . I learned physics to go with astrophysics . Radio astronomy to match my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave birth , a baby , born screaming . The only nonmystical state where the opposites are joined is infancy . So perfect they often die , babies , without cause . What 's your opinion ? " " I was an incubator baby . " " Then you know what it 's like , living in a tank . Look who I am . Someone whose air is cleaned every four hours . A face that collapses at the slightest provocation . Climb in for a minute . Come , lift the shield . I want to whisper in your ear . " Pretending he had n't heard these last few words , Billy looked away to make his report . " The mystical humming of his father-in-law . A child is born . Punchingthe walls . The dome rotates with added smoothness . " Reluctantly he turned once again to the figure in the biomembrane . " Do n't look down your nose at esoterica , " Ratner said . " If you know the right combination of letters , you can make anything . This is the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have the power of creation . This is why the various parts of the mystical writings are not in proper order . Knowing the order , you could make your own world from just reading the writings . Everythingp223is built from the twenty-two letter elements . The alphabet itself is both male and female . Creation depends on an anagram . " " It 's hard to picture . " " We have acrostics too . " " Do you have numbers ? " " Is Mickey a mouse ? " Ratner said . " Of course we have numbers . Flie emanations of the en-sof are numbers . The ten sefiroth are numericaloperations that determine the course of the universe . Constant and variable . The sefiroth are both . I could go into sefirothic geometry but you do n't have the awe for that , being mathematical . Sefiroth comes from the infinitive to count . ' The power of counting , of finger-numbers , of one-to-ten . We also have gematria , which you probably heard about , assigning numerical value to each letter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden relationships between words that we discover in this way . It would be too much of a feast to set before someone who is n't ready for it , a lifelong eater of peanuts , by which I refer to myself as viewed in the face of Fish 's revelations , gazing , a man , backyard , night upon night , galaxies and nebulas , my head filled with NGC numbers . The steel mill went on strike . I gazed like a madman . You could n't get me out of the dome with threats to my child . I decided to study the sun . Adjustments , new equipment , unsilvered mirror , precautions . The sun is a frightening thing to view through a telescope , solar wedge or no solar wedge . I thought ahead to the helium flash . The final expansion . Having aving come from the stars , we are returned . The sun within us , the source of all mystical bursts , is perfectly counterbalanced by the physical sun that presses outward , swallowing up the orbits of the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagged a bit . The lustrous muscles went slack and there was a suggestion of reinforced flesh about to melt . " Picture this , " he said . " From that great unstable period , the sun collapsesdrastically . It becomes the same size as the former earth . Now we 're right inside it , mongrelized with three other planets , compacted down to a whiff of gas . The sun proceeds to cool , white dwarf , red dwarf , black dwarf , a dead star , dark black . No energy , no light , no heat , no twinkle . The end . "  | " Can I get off now ? " " We come from supergiant solar bodies , great hot ionized objects , and we end in the center of a dead black sphere . We 're part star , you and me . Our beginning and end are made in the stars . Light , dark . High , low . Big , little . Go ahead , take it from there . " " East , west . " " Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In . " " Out . " " Give me a few , to test my fading powers . " " Love . " " Hate , " Ratner said . " Innocence . " " Kilt . " " Very good , " Billy said after a thoughtful pause . The old man lay back , panting gently . A few minutes passed . Finally he stirred himself . " When the strike ended I went back to gazing by night . I studied eclipsing stars , flare stars , variables of every kind , reading star cataloguesin my spare time , memorizing star tables , taking the cooking into the dome with me , a real fanatic . Also I feared the sight of Fish , always with the writings in his hand . He took books and folios into the toilet with him and stayed for hours . We could hear the humming from his bedroom half the night . He pushed his armchair into a corner and sat with his back to the room . This kind of transcendence I feared , a scientist , still young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching a peak of knowledge , Pittsburgh , the backyard , my own dome , handmade , that rotated . The night sky was sensational . I made charts and calculations , identifying novalike variables , Cepheids , cool and hot stars , egg-shaped doubles . The child developed putative diarrhea , terrible , a living diaper . Did I realize I was being punished for knowledge without piety or did I sit in the observatory , scanning , light from the universe entering my eye ? " " Looks like trouble 's coming , " Billy said to those assembled in thep225Great Hole . " He fears this person Fish who 's always in the toilet reading . The kid is sick . A question is asked about piety and sitting . " " Come in and browse , " Ratner said . " I know a few words I want to whisper in your ear . Come , pay a visit . Bonwit does it all the time , the doctor , holding his breath . A thing he denies doing to make me feel better . Come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from right here . " " Pay a dying man a visit . " " I 'll catch something . The shield might jam behind me and then where am I ? I can hold my breath just so long . " " Browse a while . " " Put yourself in my place , " the boy said . " What if the shield jams while I 'm in there and then you die ? What happens then ? I 'm probably taking a chance just sitting up here . All they told me was the flowers . Present the flowers . " " So this Fish , " Ratner said . " This in-law Fish of mine . My Halvah 's father . He begins to get to me with a remark passed at dinner about the hidden source of the mystical writings , doctrines and traditions . A secret beginning in the Orient . All this esoterica . Born in the East . Moving as if by stealth to other parts of the world . Always this obscurity . This secret element . I 'll tell you an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it up , tap once on the shield . A dying man has no shadow . First heard from Fish . The person about to die lacks all shadow . Knock once if I 'm lying . " " I do n't understand the question . " " You know what you remind me of ? " " What ? " " A golem , " Ratner said . " What 's that ? " " An artificial person . " " No such thing . " " According to instructions in the secret manuscripts , you get a little earth , run some water over it and then recite the letters of the alphabet in esoteric combinations with the four consonants of the **41;2936;TOOLONG . From this you get a golem. "  | " I 'm almost ready to knock once . " " Light from the universe entered my eye , " Ratner said . " I am in the dome , gazing , an ordinary night , through the eyepiece , open clusters , rich fields , my name being mentioned in the journals , this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the arts , the sciences , the humanisms , our child still in diapers , a tragedy , making watery excess thirty times a day , my Halvah up to her wrists in baby-do . Suddenly what do I see ? A thing beyond naming . Not a thing at all . A state . I am falling into a state . Radiance everywhere . An experience . I am having an experience . " Breaking the long silence that followed , Billy spoke to the others . " An ordinary night in the dome , getting famous , he starts to see something . The in-law Fish is winning . " Ratner 's left thumb quivered slightly . " There 's nothing more I can say . I lived my life . Good , evil . Aphelion , perihelion . Hungry , full . Since then I have often fallen into states , passingbeyond the opposites of the world . What use was a telescope after this ? I had the states . Every experience was a new experience . It 's something you do n't get used to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my original roots , Eastern Parkway , the dispersed of Judah . We prospered as a family , learning fear , shame , piety and awe , my mind no longer filled to satiation with knowledge of the physical universe . Being pious I felt no need to punch the walls . They kept in touch with me , the leading minds , still an award or two , invitations every week . Only one I accepted , to visit Palomar , the two-hundred-inch reflector . I sat in the observer 's cage right inside the telescope . Just the cage was bigger than my whole dome . I looked at some galaxies in detail . Nice , I liked it . When I climbed out they told me they had a special honor . A star . They gave a star my name . " " Falling into states , " Billy said to the others . " Back to Brooklyn , the walls no longer punched . He visits Palomar . A star is named . " " Lift the shield and climb in , " Ratner said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take time . Make the sacrifice . A dying man needs visits . Be a sport for once in your life . " " Infectious danger . "  | " Hold your breath and lift out the shield . Take time . It 's a worthwhile whisper or I would n't ask . " " I 'm scared in plain English . " " We 're all scared , " Ratner said . " Who is n't scared ? You , me , the laureates . Terror is everywhere . This I learned from the writings . Fish , humming , gave me his folios to take back to Brooklyn . Pitkin advises every day on the terror around us . Take demons , for example . You would n't think there 's a connection between demons and the sperm in your testicles . The terror of onanism is that bodiless demons are able to make bodies for themselves from the spilled seed . Look at a drop of semen under a microscope and see how amazed you become at the concentration of life in that small area , the darting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to make children for the demonic element . You become the father of evil spirits . How can the pious and the G-dash-d-fearing campaign against such things ? It 's not easy , believe me . Nothing in the writings is easy . If I give the impression I abandoned science for the easy life , knock once . In returning to my roots I entered a world of strict mystery . A lot of loose ends , true . But great strictness in the numerology , the permutations , the legends , the symbolism , the esoteric combinations of letters , the compilingof substitutes for the ineffable name , the secrets of golem-making . In words , what can be said about the mystical state I entered while looking through the telescope in the dome in Pittsburgh , the yard covered with soot , double shifts at the mill ? " " Nothing . " " The first man was a golem before he gave names to things , " Ratner said . " He was unformed matter waiting for a soul . Golem-making is laden with danger . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one ? " The old gentleman 's face appeared to be collapsing . Clear matter was being discharged from his pores as the face itself began to settle . ' Phis degenerative action was such that even the beret was affected . It slid forward a bit and to one side , coming to rest at a sharp angle over Ratner 's left eye , much more rakish than the occasion seemed to warrant . His voice , running down , was a mechanized caw , barely a tracep228remaining of the desperate melodies of Brooklyn . He raised his right hand slightly . " What is this but a place ? " he said . " Nothing more than a place . We 're both here in this place , occupying space . Everywhere is a place . All places share this quality . Is there any real difference between going to a gorgeous mountain resort with beautiful high thin waterfalls so delicate and ribbonlike they do n't even splash when they hit bottom  --  waterfalls that plash ; is this so different from sitting in a kitchen with bumpy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street from a gravel pit ? What are we talking about ? Two places , that 's all . There 's nowhere you can go that is n't a place . So what 's such a difference ? If you can understand this idea , you 'll never be unhappy . Think of the word place . ' A sun deck with views of gorgeous mountains . A tiny dark kitchen . These share the most important of all things anything can share . They are places . The word place ' applies in both cases . In this sense , how do we distinguish between them ? How do we say one is better or worse than the other ? They are equal in the most absolute of ways . Grasp this truth , sonny , and you 'll never be sad . " Billy felt himself being lifted in the air . It was Dr. Bonwit , removing him from the biomembrane and setting him on the floor . Although he was n't sure he liked all this lifting , he was glad to be off the tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . Pitkin approached the tank , put his ear to the chambered slot and then departed . As Bonwit and the nurse busied themselves at the cart that held the silicone preparation , Sandow rose from the organ bench . " Let us light the torches , " he said . " The lighting of the ceremonial torches . The torch-lighting commences , ladies and gentlemen . " Holding a lighted candle , Pitkin stood now at the base of the natural stage . As Sandow called their names , the laureates proceeded in alphabeticalorder to touch the wicks of their torches to Pitkin 's candleflame . Then each returned to the line . As he waited for his name to be called Billy began to get nervous . He did n't know why ; lighting a torch would be easy compared to straddling a biomembrane and being invited inside . Yet his nervousness grew . He actually feared the soundp229of his name being called . Person after person was summoned and the tension accumulated . He 'd never experienced anything like this . He began to doubt that he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It made no sense . There was nothing to fear . It was just his name being spoken aloud as part of a series of names . His distress increasedas Sandow reached the M 's . What did it mean ? His name had been called hundreds of times in a dozen places . Routinely he 'd acknowledgedit . It was his name , was n't it , and he was the person who answered , right ? He felt pressure building , a tightness in his chest and throat . Sandow got closer to T. There was no clearly defined threat and yet the pressure built . He 'd faced worse threats with relative poise . From LoQuadro and the void core to Endor 's hole 's hole to Grbk and his nipples to Mohole 's big greenie . Through all these nonspecific threats he had endured if not prevailed . The current threat , if it even qualified as such , was in a different category , he felt . The others , vague as they were , definitely qualified as threats . This one went too deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no word or phrase that quite described the tenuous nature of being . ( Oblivio obliviorum . ) To exist was to have being or actuality . To have life ; live . To continue to live . To be present under certain circumstances or in a specified place . ( Nihil ex nihilo . ) Maybe he would not occur when his name was called . It was n't merely a question of not being there to answer or of not being able to respond because of the pressure in his chest . Maybe he would not occur . ( Nada de nadiensis . ) The calling of his name might pre-empt him . The name itself might assimilate his specific presence . " Twillig . " He realized he had no torch . No one had given him a torch . Neverthelesshe walked over to Pitkin , not knowing what else to do and findingit a reasonably easy procedure . To counteract an intangible threat to one 's sense of existence it may be necessary only to take a step from here to there . He looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constriction begin to leave his body . Pitkin remained motionless , the candle burning at eye level . " I have no torch . "  | " Well put , " the advisor said . " You could make a career uttering truths . " " What happens next ? " " The old gentleman told me to tell you something even though you were in such a hurry you could n't take time to pay a visit before the face collapsed and they had to inject . It was so serious they filled the needle right in front of him . That serious I never saw it . But he took time to give me a message , face or no face , even though a certain person I 'm looking at was too much of a smarty pants to climb inside . He told me whisper to the golem in his ear . " After a pause , Pitkin 's lips began to move . However , no sound emerged . " What did he tell you to whisper ? " The lips paused a second time . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The universe is the name of G-dash-d . All of us . Everything . Here , there , everywhere . Time and space . The whole universe . It all adds up to the true name of G-dash-d . " Another laureate 's name was called and the man advanced to light his torch . Pitkin 's lips were still moving . Billy moved out of the way as the remaining two or three people responded to Sandow 's roll call . Finally all the laureates were back in line , this time with lighted torches . Sandow took his place at the keyboard and began playing a profound lament , the neon pulsing through the clear pipes in slow motion . Pitkin , still holding the candle , moved toward Billy in an earnestly furtive manner , sideways , inch by inch , eyes straight ahead , feet not lifted from the ground . " For once in my life I talk without looking , " he said . " You who I looked at before , hair-splitter , I 'm only talking this time , making sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep your knuckles off the ground . One squirm and out you go goodbye . Even watch with the way you breathe . Never through the nose . You who I 'm talking to . " " I understand you 're growing a beard , " Billy said . Swiftly , with no excess motion , Dr. Bonwit had put on a surgical mask , raised the shield , climbed into the tank and administered thep231facial injection , hunched over Ratner 's shrunken form . Now he and the nurse wheeled the biomembrane toward a man-made opening beyond which , Billy assumed , an elevator waited . Pitkin followed them , his feet alternately gliding and bumping over the ground . Finally the biomembrane , its sponsor decals gleaming , disappeared into the opening , followedfirst by Pitkin and then , as the music reached a despondent coda , by the laureates in single file , their lighted torches casting shadowtremorson the walls . This left Sandow , who climbed down from the stage and hurried out of the Great Hole . This in turn left Billy , still shaken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insubstantial , so nearly imaginary , a condition easily threatened by a one-word utterance . Pessimistic echoes were still diminishing as he headed through the opening . He came to a tall gate fastened across a shaft that was broad enough to hold a freight elevator . The elevator had already departed , however , leaving only the nurse behind , Georgette Bottomley , a slender figure dressed in white . " They could fit all those people in one elevator ? " Billy said . " Plus the tank too ? " " Plus the tank too but not plus Georgette . " " No room for one more ? " " I do n't mind telling you I 'm peeved off about that . Whenever doctor wants to get in his clientele 's good graces , it means nurse have to wait . All my professional life I 've been standing aside for the parade to go by . There 's a chain of priority , you got to understand . This time it was doctor first , patient second , Nobel Prize winners third , rhythm section fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomized place bringing up the rear . I 'm good and peeved . I 'll say it again . " " Where are you from ? " " United States . " " Whereabouts ? " " Hundred Thirty-eighth Street . " " I 've heard of it . " " Ever been there ? " " Never been there . Just heard of it . " " Good and peeved , " she said . " All my life I did without . I launchedp232my professional career so I could stop doing without . Doctor has a house with grounds . I always know when he 's trying to impress somebody , because that 's when he tells me to step off an elevator or get out of a moving vehicle . Business , industry and the corporation . Nothing under an executive vice-president gets into that office . We run checks so nobody can falsify their title . Doctor looks up their fannies and tells them they 're doing just fine . When we get their waste specimen reports back from the lab , he calls them up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they 're out of town on business , he wires them about their specimens . Nice , fine , beautiful . He gives them encouragement . He praises their specimens . Oldest trick in the world but it always works . " " I guess that 's how you get a house with grounds . " " Always I 'm the one 's got to make room , understand . But no point you and me swinging the heavy gloves . We got a long flight ahead . It 's doctor and the beard I 'm peeved off at . " " I 'm not going back . " " Mean to tell me you 're staying here ? " " I guess so . " " You standing there and telling me plane or no plane you are not hot-trotting your body away from this locale ? " " I stay until somebody says leave , I guess . Nobody 's said anything as far as I know . I guess I stay . " " That fazes me . It really does . That fazes my whole composure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It 's not a question of bad , " Georgette said . " An accident is bad , which I 've been at a hundred before I went into private practice . This place is no accident , no . But it 's got such separate parts , seems like to me . Maybe it 's just too new . All I know is one thing does n't lead to another the way it should . I 'm glad I 'm going . I just wish this elevator had a button I could push so a light come on and we get out of here fast . See , that 's what I mean about one thing not leading to another . Whenever you have an elevator with no button to call it with , that 's when you wake up in the middle of the night with the menses cramps . " The freight elevator descended and kept right on going . Through the gate they watched it pass their level . A few minutes later they heard itp233coming up . When it stopped finally , Evinrude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been holding when Billy had encountered him in the vicinity of the jagged hole . This time the torch was unlighted . Georgette unlatched the gate and they stepped into the elevator . Evinrudelifted a projecting handle , starting them upward . He gave the two passengers no more than a grudging nod before directing his attention to the floor between his feet . After a long climb he depressed the lever and the elevator came to a stop . " You , the nurse , you step off . The boy stays until we reach his stop . Stand back for the moving gate , watch your step stepping off , walk do n't run . " They ascended again , two of them , moving in remarkably smooth fashion considering the fact that this was a freight elevator and not the smaller vibrationless kind . " And so irrational numbers were defined as convergent sequences of rationals , " the manuscript had said . " The deft manipulation of such polar extremes , with resulting approximate values , may drive the purely logical observer to seal himself in a brickwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poetic truth ' that so often accompany sequential definitions and ( to cross the mathematicalbrink this once , and briefly ) approximations of any kind . " Evinrudestopped the elevator , opened the gate and led Billy into a gigantic storeroom full of equipment . " This is where we expect them to surface , " he said . " Who ? " " The pigeons . " " The ones released in the ceremony ? " " They flew through a hole in solid rock and from there either back out again or into a ventilation duct that leads up eventually into this storeroom . If they flew back out into the Great Hole , that 's not so bad . If they 're in here or en route to in here , that means trouble . " " Did n't anyone know this would happen ? " " They were n't supposed to release pigeons , " Evinrude said . " The subject was raised at a briefing . It was determined no pigeons . We drew up guidelines . We went to great lengths . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I happen to hate pigeons . I ca n't stand beingp234anywhere near them . But it 's my job to retrieve so I 'll just have to submersemy feelings and go do it . All this because somebody ignored the guidelines . " " Pitkin , I bet . " " The duct 's over that way . " " Why do I have to be here ? " " I need someone to help me deal with the pigeons . I did n't have the wherewithal emotionally to ask someone my own age . Besides , children know how to deal with animals . Adults have grown too far from their origins to be able to confront animals on a nonpet basis . The duct comes out of the wall behind that long row of tables . " They pushed through a dozen stacks of shipping containers . Deal with the pigeons , the man had just said . To Billy this sounded as though either a massacre or a bargaining session was in store . Evinrude still carried the unlighted torch , a circumstance suggesting massacre . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The very word strikes fear into my heart , " Evinrude said . " Mathematics ? " " It goes back to early schooling . The muffled terror of those gray mornings getting out of bed and going to school and opening up a mathematics textbook with its strange language and letters for numbers and theorems to memorize . I did n't mind any other subject . But math struck terror . Everything about it . The sound of the words . The diagramsand formulas . The look of the book . Sometimes I find it hard to believe that humans actually do mathematics , considering what 's involved . It 's like a branch of learning in outer space . " As they got closer to the ventilation duct , Evinrude carefully inspectedthe floor as well as every item of equipment within reach . " I do n't think they 're here , " he said . " Because I 'll tell you why . Wherever pigeons are , pretty soon the shithing starts . " " The what ? " " Pigeons are known for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " " Did I say it wrong ? "  | " Definitely . " " There 's not something called bullshith ? " " There 's no h at the end . There 's just one h and it 's near the begin-ning . " " I should be standing here frankly amazed . I should but I 'm not . BecauseI 'll tell you why . All my life I 've been making little mistakes like that . Shith ' is just one example . I guess I learned it wrong . " " Where did you grow up ? " " In the outskirts , " Evinrude said . " With a volunteer family . I had no parentage of my own . I think this led to oversights in my upbringing . Little gaps here and there . I 'm weak in some areas . No doubt about it . " " Shit is universal no matter which language . Use my spelling and I guarantee you 're safe . " They reached the duct . Evinrude flicked a switch , reversing the air current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can forget it because once the air is flowing the other way the only thing they can do is relax and be carried back to the Great Hole . They 're on their way down . We got here in time . They have n't surfaced . I definitely think that entitles us to something . " A single pigeon stood about sixty feet to Evinrude 's right . Billy pointed it out to him . The pigeon began to approach , taking little pinkfootedgrip-steps . Evinrude held his torch out away from his body , then placed it gently on the ground , as though signifying his peaceful intentions . " Why is n't it flying ? " he said . " I can accept their presence in the air . When they walk I hate them . I just want to crumple . " " Then let 's leave . " " Why is n't it afraid ? It 's walking right at us . I hate the way the head goes back and forth . They 're full of disease in case you did n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very famous for disease . Watch out for your nervous system in particular . " " I 'm going , " Billy said . " Goodbye . " " I consider myself terrified . I 'm consciously trying to inundate my feelings but so far no luck at all . I am really scared . I can hardly bearp236to look at its little head gliding forward and back , forward and back . I hate the way it walks , do n't you ? Those scabby little feet . It 's definitely headed this way in case you had hopes . " " I 'm running , " Billy said . " If I were you , I 'd do the same . Come on . Let 's go . Goodbye . " " I do n't know how to run . " " Come on , hurry . " " I never learned , " Evinrude said . " Everybody knows how to run . It 's easy . You just move your legs and then you 're running . The brain sends a message to your legs and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hurry up about it , I 'm leaving . Just move your legs fast . Get your brain to send the message . Everybodycan run . It 's not hard . Try it and see what happens . " The pigeon took several more pink steps . " It 's not hard if you know how , " Evinrude said . " I do n't happen to know how . The subject of running is foreign to me . As a child I was n't taught how to run and I 've never been able to pick it up on my own . It 's something I 've always envied in other people , this marvelous ability to run . "  |p237There  were times when he felt the lure of a submoronic mode of being . During such periods his mind turned opaque , making it hard for him to perceive the simplest incentive . It would be easy , he believed , to spend a lifetime in this stateless zone . Content to be organic . Content to perform only monotonous tasks . Content to forsake coherent speech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the soul of a plant . In time he 'd dispense with voluntary motion and the natural management of his body . Content to smell himself and dream of downy molds.  |p238This  feeling always occurred when he was on the verge of solving a drawn-out mathematical problem . It seemed to mean , nearing the end , that he preferred to abandon all the structural forms , the intersecting perspectives , the entire weightless system of exact relationships ; discard it all in exchange for the scantest condition of existence . The intuition of mathematical order occupied the deeper reaches of cognitive possibility , too old and indistinct for tracing , predating even the analytical scrapings of logic and language . Because his work 's natural tendency was to provide a model of his own mind , of himself as a distinct individual , he was puzzled by the lack of an adequate vocabularyfor mathematical invention , by his inability to understand what made his mathematics happen . In retaliation , as it were , against the secrecy of his own constructions , he engineered a desire to subsist on minims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown self , that the basest nature was clearly preferable . At the module he scribbled nonsense on a pad . This surprised him , this familiar indication that he verged on an answer , because it accompanied the solution of a problem that was anything but familiar , having ( he was coming to see ) none of the usual shadings and gradations . Sequence , form , unsuspected relationships were not really the issue here . But the process seemed the same as always . He could feel it happening , an emptying of both modes of consciousness , the asymmetric transmapping of fact and unorganized reality . Beings that need no intervening substance to transmit their art , able to write with their fingers , laser-paint with eyes alone , creatures such would surely know this feeling , as of nature taking part in thought , the living brain that codes its own development . He scribbled calmly , oblivious to everything but one emerging thought , feeling the idea unerase itself , most evident of notions , an idea with a history , scribbling , rule of ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rudimentary being . Leaflikeness . A conditionscaled down to noncomplex sensation . No , there was no way to name the process . Mathematical ideas exist between adjacent points on a line segment . He got up and walked around the room , unaware of sound and color and yet knowing , touching , seeing , hearing , breathing ,  |p239sheer  certainty , feeling it inside him , watching his own feet ( what a funny word , hearing it , " feet , " for the first time ) move him ever more purely around the room . Thus the simple answer surfaced , deprived at first of linguistic silvering . In the seconds that followed he knew it in words . Notation by sixty . That had to be it , a positional notation system based on the number sixty . He knew that thousands of years ago two systems of numeration were used in Mesopotamia . Decimal and sexagesimal . The latter used a base of sixty instead of ten . Because the Sumerians had divided the year into three hundred and sixty days , they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their astronomy . Notation by sixty also had the advantage over the decimal system in all work involving fractionsbecause sixty has more divisors than ten . The vertical wedge used in Mesopotamia to denote the number one was also used for sixty . In the decimal system a given three-digit number is a way of expressing a quantity in terms of multiples of ten . Schoolchildren know that the number three hundred and twenty-four means three times one hundred ( or 102 ) , plus two times ten ( 101 ) , plus four times one ( 100 ) . In sexagesimal notation , the tens become sixties . The message had been received in the form of fourteen pulses , a gap ; twenty-eight pulses , a gap ; fifty-seven pulses . He realized now that the total of one hundred and one units was not important . This total viewed differently , as one zero one , or binary number five , was equally unimportant . The fact that one , four , two , eight , five and seven are the digits of a recurring decimal had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the number of blank intervals ( two ) were also meaningless . All that mattered was the original series of pulses : fourteen , twentyeight , fifty-seven . In notation by sixty these are not three numbers but a way of expressing a single large number . To discover this number it is necessary only to multiply fourteen by thirty-six hundred ( 602 ) , twentyeightby sixty ( 601 ) , fifty-seven by one ( 60  --  ) . What was being transmittedthen was the number fifty-two thousand one hundred and thirtyseven.  |p240A  man stood in the open doorway . This , in our terms , was what the extraterrestrials were communicating . Their natural way of expressing this quantity , since they used powers of sixty , was in the form of the number 14,28,57 . There was no reason why an advanced civilization should use a place-value system based on ten . Maybe they 'd overcome all the problems inherent in a sixty-system and used it to much greater advantage than we use the decimal method . Of course , it remained for Billy to discover the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how to interpret the transmission , he could begin the task of decoding it . What did the new value mean ? Obviously this constituted the second half of the problem . For an unreal moment he imagined that the man in the doorway was an extraterrestrial , here to confirm his arithmetic . But there was nothing very exotic about the man and when he introduced himself as Dr. Skip Wismer , a NASA consultant on loan to Field Experiment Number One , Billy thought it a mere coincidence ( of the nonexotic type ) that he was associated with astronauts . Wismer went on to explain that since he had to pass this way to get to the demonstration , he thought he 'd stop by and pick up Billy . " I 'm halfway done with the reason they got me here for . I guess it 's okay to take a break . " " How do you know it 's halfway ? " Wismer said . " You wo n't know where the halfway point is until you 're able to look back on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead , you do n't know how much you 've done . This is plain common sense . " " It 's a feeling . Very definitely says half . When I get it this strong I know it 's true . " " You 're claiming in effect to be digging half a hole . Ca n't be done , can it ? Besides you 're not even supposed to be working on the code . The source of the transmission is what we 're primarily concerned with for the time being . In addition to which is the fact that the message was never repeated . Repetition in a case like this is essential . Without it , there 's no reason to believe the pulse array is correct . Not to mention the computer retrovert we 've just run that indicates error in the receivingequipment . Probably the switch-frequency generator. "  | " What 's this demonstration you mentioned ? " " The Leduc electrode , " Wismer said . This did n't sound very promising . But since there was nothing else to do right now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something he was determined to get rid of , namely the large green pill that ( ) rang Mohole had forced him to accept in his apartments on top of the armillary sphere . He knew if he carried it around long enough , it would get him into some kind of tricky situation . He excused himself , went into the bathroom , closed the door , lifted the top of the toilet tank , dropped Mohole 's greenie inside and was about to replace the porcelain lid when he realized something was floating in the water . It was a tiny cardboard matchbox . He took it out of the tank and slid it open . Inside was a tightly folded piece of paper , wet at the edges . He removed it from the box and unfolded it .

Skip Wismer led him over a footbridge high above a miniature recycled waterfall and then into a sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Wismer said , " whenever I 'm in the presence of someone with your kind of vast mental capacities . For instance , do you believe in someone or something larger than yourself ? " " That takes in a lot of territory . " " Scientist or not , I sometimes feel overwhelmed by it all . I mean the sheer allness , the sheerness of it all . To cite an example , what do you suppose happens to a person after death ? "  | " He remains in that state . " " My wife is dead , you know . " " Nobody warned me . " " What kind of system permits this sort of finality ? " " Death ? " " It 's so definitive . " " Buried or cremated ? " " She 's in an icebox in Houston , " Wismer said . " Left her body to science . " " What will they do with it ? " " I hate to tell you . " " Stick needles ? " " At the very least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worries me , not least of all the question of what happens in the first few seconds after electrical activity in the brain ceases forever . PersonallyI think there 's some kind of turning inside out . That 's my theory . An unknotting of consciousness in a space of n dimensions . A turning outward . Not that I 'd say the word . I 'd rather commit the act than say the word . Particularly in front of a lady . " " What word ? " " Evaginate . " They entered a huge operating theater . " So what 's this electrode we 're seeing demonstrated ? " " It 's a device that would greatly simplify manned space missions . Probably increase an astronaut 's capabilities a thousandfold . Which means I 'll be a very interested observer today . Of course I do n't know what they want to use it for . " Two men entered the theater . They were dressed in surgical gear  --  masks , caps , gowns , gloves . Dr. Wismer greeted them and then took a seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was full of wires , cables and monitoring devices . There was so much wiring in fact that nine or ten different colors had been used to enable technicians and others to distinguish between the strands . Wires were bundled , twisted and interlaced . They connected various machines , ran along the walls and floor , hung in clumps from a section of ceiling where panels had been removed.  | " Ignore this mess , " one of the men said . " It 's the equivalent of makingprophecies by studying an animal 's entrails . Now that we 've got the Leduc electrode , all this paraphernalia gets junked . My name is Cheops Feeley . " " I 've heard of your medal . " " That 's not the only thing named after me . There 's a science fair , two research centers and a gypsy health clinic . " " You 're a gypsy ? " " Lapsed . " " I heard your medal 's given for work that 's crazy in places . " " Madness content , " Feeley said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict scientific merit is only one of the elements considered . The dark side of the award is what appeals to most people . " There was a large shipping container in a corner of the room . Billy noticed a scrawny old cat looking out over the top of the box . Cheops Feeley took a long step forward , putting both his hands on the boy 's head , probing with his fingertips . " You 've got it , all right . Just as I suspected . I was sure it would be there . " " What would be there ? " " The mathematics bump . " " If there 's a bump , it never hurt . " " It 's a life passion of mine , skull conformation . Yours is very distinct . Definitely a bump for mathematics . That settles it . " " Settles what ? " " Everything , " Feeley said . " You 're definitely the person we want . The Leduc electrode is only part electrode . It 's a bundle of extremely tiny wires able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke of genius . These wires are attached to a microminiaturized disk that functions almost exactly as a computer does . But not just any computer . The Leduc electrode has Space Brain capability . And it 's small enough to be implanted under someone 's scalp . Through a tiny incision that leaves no scars . Once it heals . And the hair grows back . " All he could see of the men were their eyes , two sets , very steady , green here , hazel there , pinched in by mask and cap . Slowly the cat worked its way over the top of the box , followed by two others justp244as mangy . Billy looked up at Skip Wismer , who seemed to have dozed off . " The Leduc electrodes are in that container to your right . " " Who 's that on my left ? " " That 's Leduc . " The other man nodded . At least , Billy thought , everybody 's identified . One of the cats lazily climbed back into the box as three others emerged . Cheops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wires attached . Terrific hygiene procedures . Watch him clean it off with some spit . " We ordered blue and pink . But they only sent pink . " " Are they different besides color ? " Feeley shook his head . " Here 's our thinking on the matter . You with your enormous powers of abstraction . Space Brain with its unsurpassed superfine computations . A single dynamic entity . With no scars . And hair that 's guaranteed to grow back . " " Sounds familiar , talk of this combination . " " We have massive backing . The resources of a very powerful cartel . Once the electrode is buried in your head , assuming you agree to such a procedure , all I have to do is notify them and you get paid a generous retainer for a period of time not to exceed the life of the appliance . " " They want to regulate the money curve , right ? That 's their only interest in life . The two strange talkers . Tell them my head stays shut . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just a trial run . I want to point out that subcutaneous implantation is no great problem in and of itself . Although there 's a slight inconvenience in this particular case . " " Cat hairs . " " Listen closely , " Feeley said . " The problem with the device as now constituted is that it tends to overstimulate the left side of the brain . This will result in an overpowering sense of sequence . You 'll be acutely aware of the arrangement of things . The order of succession of events . The way one thing leads to another . This is a side effect of carrying the appliance under your scalp but it 's not too great a price to pay for the kind of madness ratio we 're getting , not to mention scientific value.  |p245True  , you 'll find yourself analyzing a continuous series of acts in terms of their discrete components . Eating a sandwich will no longer be the smooth operation you 've always known it to be . You 'll experience , should you agree to host the electrode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your throat , your stomach , whatever 's between the slices of bread , the bread itself . You might even find yourself in retrogradeorbit , so to speak . Bread , bakery truck , bakery , flour , wheat and so on . There is so much involved . Our lives are so dense . The baker 's hands , the farmer , his barn , the paint job , the latex , the trees . There is so much and all of it will be apprehended , as you eat the sandwich , should you agree to the implantation , in related sequence . In consecutive order . In proper succession . You 'll be involved in a very detailed treatment of reality . A parody of the left brain . But is this reality of yours less valid than ordinary reality ? Not at all . You 'll be establishing fresh paths of awareness . Taking nothing for granted . Dealing with unlimiteddata . Every breath you take will be subjected to a thorough sequential analysis . Heart , lungs , nostrils , oxygen , carbon dioxide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all right there for the asking . " The scabby cats seeped in and out of the box where the electrodes were stored . Cheops Feeley explained once more that Billy would be given ample time to decide whether he wanted to take part . This was just a test exercise , a dress rehearsal for the actual implantation . The procedure , should he agree to it , would be carried out in a chair-shaped operating table to save time between barbering and incision . He asked Leduc to get the table in question , as a practice maneuver , and then , handing the pink disk or " appliance " to the boy , went to look for a comb , pair of scissors and hair clipper . Finding himself alone with the dozing Dr. Skip Wismer , Billy moved in deliberate stages to the nearest exit . He eased his head out past the door frame and into the corridor , ready to follow it with left foot and leg . Someone was drinking from an ornamental fountain in a circular area about fifty feet beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark-skinned and absolutely naked . Billy was motionless now , watching . As the man raised himself , his hands uncupping from his face , the boy could see that he was white-haired ,  |p246although  of indeterminate age , and that his chest was painted with geometric figures . He stepped back into the operating theater . Leduc entered through another door , wheeling the chairlike device , which included among other things a battery of pen recorders poised to scribble brain rhythms on a continuous sheet of graph paper . Cheops Feeley arrived a moment later , carrying a barber 's kit . " Hercule , you do the hair , " he said . " Just pretend , of course . Move the clippers over his head . " " I do not give permission , " Billy said . " Why so formal ? " " I 'm just saying there 's no point doing any more of this , because I 'm not agreeing to do it . I do n't know how I let it get this far . " " Nobody 's going to force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in the trial run , that 's all we ask . Help us get our timing down pat . Then , later , should you change your mind , we 'll be able to function smoothly , as befits an undertaking of this magnitude . " " How can a gypsy be lapsed ? " " A simple announcement usually suffices , " Feeley said . " Now , please , take a seat in our device . Leduc will make clipping motions over your head . " " I get these foot cramps . I have one now . If I sit down , I 'm finished . The only way to get rid of it is to give the blood a chance to circulate . That means to stay in a standing position . " Feeley looked at Hercule Leduc , who spoke for the first time , his voice blunted somewhat by the surgical mask he was wearing . " It is convenient for you to believe you have a cramp , " he said . " All of physical reality is a matter of convenience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient to believe that A leads to B ? Both and neither . When we have succeeded in wedging an exception between the external world and our awareness of it , then we will discover that the divinity of the spirit of consciousness is based on the risks we are willing to take in order to fabricate pure terror and Olympian love . It was convenient for you to see an aborigine a few moments ago . This is poetic espionage undertaken by the senses to counteract the suspicions of void we harborp247regarding existence itself . We are most a victim of the principle of intelligencewhen we try to conceal our lonely terror and pursue a style of incessant self-deception . " Dozens of cats climbed in and out of the shipping container . The two gowned men conferred for a moment . Billy still had the electrode he 'd been given earlier . He sidled over to the box and dropped it in among the cats and the other pink disks . Then he stood there shaking his foot as if to stimulate increased blood circulation in that area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " About what ? " " The cramp , " he said . " Hercule , do we believe him ? " " It 's numb at the same time as it buzzes , if you want to compare it with your own both experiences . " " We agree to believe you on one condition , " Feeley said . " Let 's hear . " " That , whether or not you agree to the implantation , you seriously consider being put in a package . Lecture tours , talk shows , a quickie biography , T-shirts , funny buttons . The ancillary rights alone could set us up for years . Endorsements , puzzles , games , mathematics LPs . The talent is obvious , it 's there , you 've got the bump .

" " People from the Bronx do n't have heroes . " It was Rosicrucia Sandoval who told Billy that the scream lady was dead . Rosicrucia was a short broad woman with breasts so bunched up and shapeless under her housedress that they appeared to be still in thep248process of formation . Her estranged common-law husband had been following her for months , his right hand inside his jacket , a theatrical mannerism meant to signify the presence of a weapon . Wherever she went she saw him , Sixto Ortiz by name , until finally she asked Faye for permission to use the Terwilligers ' fire escape to get in and out of the building . Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alley , which in turn led to the basement doors of five different buildings , Rosicrucia felt she 'd be able to move freely without being seen . Babe okayed the arrangement on the condition that she take the garbage with her on her way out the window . The setup lasted only one day because of the attack dog 's reaction to someone coming in from the fire escape . Babe told Faye to inform the beleaguered woman that she had less to fear than she thought . " Hispanics only shoot from cars , " he said . " Tell her not to worry until he starts following her in a car . Hispanics shoot into crowds from speeding cars . Of course , there 's always the chance he plans to knife her . A car is no good to him then . " About a month before the scream lady died , Rosicrucia sat on a foldingchair in front of the building and , while keeping an eye out for Sixto , told Billy about the scream lady 's recent operation . " They gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I heard . But now she 's quiet since they did it . Only screams once , twice a day . It 's how they quiet certain people . " " Ectomy , " he said . " That 's right , ectomy , they did an ectomy . It 's what they do to quiet a woman when they get to a bad age . Take out the hysterical organs . Three hours on the table plus . When she screams it 's different now . Not so much an animal , you know ? " " Maybe they took out the wrong organ , " he said . " They should have took the throat . " " The throat is not hysterical , " Rosicrucia said . " Only hysterical organscome out in an ectomy . " That same day he entered the building behind his own and climbed four flights of stairs to the scream lady 's door . He had dared himself to do it and so here he was . It was a period of his childhood in which hep249constantly dared himself to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once snatched from her hand ( cryptic numeroglyphics ) was still hidden in one of his textbooks . But why , all daring aside , was he here ? Maybe to ask her what the occult writing had meant . Or to hear her speak a single intelligible word . Or simply to look at her again . Nevertheless he was too scared to knock on the door . He dared himself again and again . ( Knock or I 'll kill you . ) But he just stood there looking at the door . He looked at it until it opened . There she was once more , dressed in two or three bathrobes , exceedingly real , her presence fully developed in the dimness , a reminder of some cavernous fear . A sense of decomposition seemed paradoxically to replenishher body . Her power derived from this physical dwindling ; she gathered strength from it , prospering on the horror in other people 's eyes . Again she was barefoot and from an invisible hole in her throat came the same muted static . He backed off instinctively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Not once did she move , contentto stand in the doorway in her furrowed robes . " Put it in words , " he said . After a while she screamed . He did n't move . Motion at this point would have been disrespectful . He had never been this close to the scream lady when she was in the act of screaming and it was an occasionnot without a certain commercial solemnity , resembling some authentic and quite powerful native rite at which attendance by tourists is permitted during specified hours . So he stood where he was , afraid to violate a tender balance between the woman and her act . For that second or two he lived within the scream . It vibrated inside him and overwhelmed the air around him  --  horrible , of course  --  much more than meaningless noise , her madness in its waveforms and repetitions occupying his body , madness measured in cycles per second , her willfuldisintegration taking over his mind . He watched her go back into the apartment . She did n't close the door behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several moments , or until the scream completelyleft his body . Then he followed her into the apartment , expecting to see stacks of old newspapers and filthy drifts of clothing that she 'd gathered from the street and left everywhere to rot . But once out of thep250long entranceway he could see it was different , that she lived in stark circumstances , junkless , very little furniture , a cot to sleep on , both rooms nearly empty and yet far from bare . The walls . Because of the walls . Everywhere he looked there was black crayon script , her secret writing flung across the walls from floor to ceiling , uninterrupted by windows , doors , corners of the room . She sat by the open window , looking out on alleys lined with dented garbage cans . The small boy walked along a wall , trying to read the black wax , inhaling what she 'd written , fumes from a hundred coloring books , that oily condiment he 'd so often savored on his own two hands .

Open hydrants lowered the water pressure and women screamed out of top-story windows at the boys and girls standing in the wide cockscomb spray they 'd created by putting a bottomless keg over the mouth of the hydrant . Billy and his father stood on the stoop with a man named Consagra , a recent occupant , heavy and squat , said to be an illegal alien . Kids scaled the playground fence , ran and stopped short , jostled each other in elaborately designed war rhythms whose immediate purposewas the baring of homemade weapons , no more ( in these early stages of the evening ) than simple disclosure , a promise ( as glancing as oblique light ) of later improvisations . Whenever Consagra 's attention was diverted , Babe would turn toward his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buck teeth , bunched-up lips . People ate fudgesicles with the wrapper twined around the stick . " There 's a thin line between exterminator and roach , " Babe said . A squad car cruised past a man in the playground systematically breaking bottles . Figures came up from the basement rooms where carriages were stored . There were card games and radios . Naked childrenon fire escapes . Warm-weather flesh and the dismal ash of burninggarbage . Inside , small bugs were sucked out of the dark to carom off the TV screen . Faye and Billy sat there watching a senile teenage epic ( " Hey , kids , we 're gon na be late for the luau " ) while Babe scoured ashtrays for a smokable butt . " So what kind of movie ? " " Sit-throughable , " she said . " I 'll need the set in ten minutes . " " Nertz to you , bozo . " " Ten minutes and counting . " " You only wish . " " What kind of junk is that to be showing the kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from awful stuff like that . " " It 's a special kind of awful , " she said . " You 're not a movie person , so do n't even ask me to explain . It 's the kind of awful you have to have a feel for . Why do n't you call Izzy with some batting stances ? " Much of local violence had garbage at its heart . People 's leavingsp252were too significant to be consigned to grunting trucks , omnivorous burrowing machines that deprived the streets of their distinctions . In street fights , garbage was a weapon to be tossed . In arguments between neighbors it was garbage that was trailed across a doorway . Communal protests featured garbage mounds in flames . Garbage was a source of insult , a proud burden , a fester never ending , a mode and code of conduct ( often air-mailed from windows to ease a burdened mind ) . The dead were sometimes found in garbage cans . Consagra looked across the street to the bottle-breaker speaking to the broken glass around him . Babe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ralphie Buber said . The Bronx Zoo was several blocks east of Crotona Avenue . In a fairly remote part of the zoo was a series of ornate metal cages where the big birds lived . On rotted logs and long branches in the last of these cages the hooded vultures squatted . Impossibly large and indolent , bleak velvet-brown feather massed and hooked beaks stark as nickel silver , the five vultures dwelt in desultory camouflage , more majestic than the other birds ( eagles , condors , hawks ) because they did not beat their wings in grand futility , hating even freedom . Signs , omens , portents , auguries and foretokens . Even an auspex of old , gazing upon these adepts of dead flesh , might muse that bird divination had seen its better days now that squatting was the vogue . " I wish there was a hooded vulture rental agency , " Natasha said . " It would be perfect for people our size who want to kill themselves . You go to the agency and rent a vulture and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a great height and then drop you . They would be trained to drop you anywhere you wanted to be dropped . You could be dropped right in front of your own house if you wanted to get even with your mother and father for being your parents . Or you could be dropped over a big green valley or into a lake . Hooded vultures would be the best way for people our size . Imagine how everyone would feel , reading about the body being found . " Ralphie Buber spent his nights and days on the verge of a lunatic drool . Although he performed acts and committed social misdemeanors that far exceeded drooling , his basic nature seemed best defined by drivel and slime . He was oversized and extremely flabby and for thesep253reasons smaller children liked to knead and beat him . Ralphie , seen purely in physical configuration , was designed to be punched by little fists . It was a daily occurrence , this informal mauling , as was his reaction to such assaults , an attitude of corpulence offended . Billy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's haunches . It was never any problem avoiding a counterattack . Often the boy forgot to make one , staring at his assailant with the knowledge that something had been done at his expense but hardly an inkling what ; and when he did respond it was with loose flesh bouncing and both hands tearing at his own hair , more dangerous to himself than others , a living marvel easy to evade . It was odd then that Ralphie of all the local oafs should choose to mock the bulky Consagra . Fusion and swirl everywhere . Multiple-flash effect . The street heavily textured with desperate energies . From the stoop of their building Babe and Billy watched Ralphie Buber approach holding a live crab stolen from the fish market . Consagra , who resembled poured cement , was wearing a sleeveless T-shirt , rolled-up chinos and work boots . He looked down at Ralphie with barely evident contempt , a slight narrowing of the eyes , a tension about the jaw , the hooded scorn a laborer has for discrepancies in the landscape . " I 'll bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll stick my both pincers all the way in to your kidney liver . Then I 'll eat your eyes , dumb nuts . " " Who you talk ? " " This is Crabman speaking . Attention all cars . I got a man on the stoop with his armpits showing . Sound the alarm , all units of the crab patrol . There 's a man here that 's acting like he 's white , male , human . Free food on the stoop . Hurry all cars . " " Shut up you face , " Consagra said . " Crabs at sea , we have an imported human in the area . All units at top speed . This is Crabman signing off for now . " " I kill . " " This is Crabman back on the shortwave in his pale-green panel truck . Emergency call , sound the crab alarm . Free meal , free meal . " " Go the other street or I break you hole , " Consagra said . " Keep talk , nice-nice , I come there kill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . They reach allp254the way in to your lung muscles . Crabman saying man on the stoop that tastes of steak meat . Last chance to get your free bites in . " Ralphie was talking into the crab 's abdomen , using the creature as a microphone as well as alternate persona . When Consagra started down the steps , however , the boy thrust the crab toward him , employing it now as talisman or actual weapon . As he held the crab extended he made throttled aquatic sounds . Consagra responded by making a fist and biting it . It remained for Rosicrucia Sandoval to come outside and step between them , her disorganized upper torso making Billy think that two or three abandoned infants might be clinging to her breasts . LET HIM WITH UNDERSTANDING RECKON THE NUMBEROF THE BEAST FOR IT IS A HUMAN NUMBER 666A week 's pay in his pocket , Babe came bouncing down the steps of a Third Avenue bus late one night and headed east alongside the high curving stone wall of a hospital for the incurably ill . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about one hundred yards . He slowed his pace . The other man was just emerging from the unviewable part of the bending wall , figure more than man , something of a puzzle , coming as he did not just out of the darkness of Quarry Road but from a second surface really , a concealed extension of the curved line occupied by Terwilliger . There was no one else in sight and the only streetlamp was back near the bus stop . The other man wore a long coat and walked in a strange many-legged way , taking several short steps for every long slow stride Babe took . As the gap between the men diminished , Babe worried about that long coat . It was a dark coat , extremely long , much longer than his own coat , and this worried him . He could n't imagine why anyone would wear a coat that long except as a weapons carrier or mobile receptacle for stolen goods . The other man , drawing closer , naturally began to grow to his true size ( perceived from Terwilliger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other man 's size ) and at the same time he seemed to be getting smaller and smaller . But this was only because Babe had feared and expected someone very large and kept waiting for the other man'sp255mammoth dimensions to be made known . Babe himself was six feet four . But his coat , in a relative sense , could not begin to compare with the other man 's coat in terms of size and threatening color . The other man wore a hat and Babe did not . He kept his hands in the pockets of his long coat while Babe 's hands were clenched at his sides . The high stone wall was to Babe 's right , the other man 's left . He was ready for anything the other man might attempt , too ready perhaps , overprepared , displaying not grace but hysterical petty belligerence under pressure , for when they drew to within a yard of each other the quicksteppingman skidded on a bit of squashed fruit and Babe reacted massively , overreacted perhaps , jumping no more than an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisting his body toward the other man ( who was trying to keep his balance by running in place on the slippery fruit ) and landing with feet strategically set apart , body firm and ready , well established in a lower and more advantageous center of gravity , hands now unclenched and knife-swiping at the air in short clean lethal strokes . " Kill-kill-kill ! " he shouted . Again and again . " Killkill-kill ! " The sound surprised even Terwilliger and in its pump-action ferocity literally knocked the other man off his feet . Babe could not stop shouting . The other man , now seen to be not only extremely small but also very , very old and almost surely Chinese , was on his back on the sidewalk , near the base of the wall . Babe was not able to come out of his frozen gladiator pose . The other man remained on his back , expressionless , his legs bent in and up with knees locked in at chest level , his small old hands crumpled near his face , the hat still on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the upthrust legs . In time Babe stopped shouting . Slowly he began to circle the other man , careful not to relax his defenses too much , the right hand still slashing perfunctorilyat the air . The other man was pivoting on the small of his back in order to keep Babe 's movements in his line of vision . It was a pretty funny sight , this old man turning while on his back like an armored beetle , limbs bent inward to protect his body , felt hat still on his head . As Babe , circling , reflected on the comic aspects of the situation , his right shoulder brushed against the stone wall . " Ya ! " he shouted . " Wha-ya ! " He shouted just twice this time , only moderatelyp256startled by the contact , but the noise was sufficient to force the old Chinese into a supreme display of body fortification . Still spinning on his back , elbows providing most of the impetus , he slowly raised his head toward his knees , giving Babe a better look at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , digging them into his upper lip . Even with teeth bared the other man could n't be said to have undergone much of a change in expression . His face was undisturbed , even serene , and it was possible to interpret the teeth-baring not as a gesture of selfdefensebut rather as a philosophical maneuver designed to show Babethat nothing less that a living skull occupied that old felt hat , anOriental brain-case , a nearly timeless object indifferent to decay , erolionand the violent chemistries of men . In this manner , the one mansupine and flashing his lower teeth , the other ripping at the air with hislarge right hand , they made one more full revolution on the dark and lonely sidewalk . A path led him through a grove of ginkgo trees , their fanlike leavesdipping in the breeze from sea-light to dense shade . It was a narrow path , not often trod it seemed , rough-edging into grass and shrubs , leading nowhere special , the kind of country lane that peters out incarpetweed . Coming toward him was a woman wheeling a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost unendurablylovely , her face uncovered from some lost medallion , an ancient oval coin dug up and rubbed alive . Rose-white woman . She had eyes saturated in light , a fresh wet smile . Tall , a drifting walk , herbody all radiant flux . Outside the strict limits of balance , evenness andline , all body-timed to lure the casual student into erroneous raptures about purely chance perfection , was a creature 's awesome grubby joy in sensing the very air , detecting automatically those things beyond analysis . Brownish hair blown forward over her shoulders . Long hands , slender , cool and white . There was the baby carriage to be considered as well . Draped in semitransparent white fabric it was the single most surprising thing Billy had yet come upon at Field Experiment Number One . But he could n't bring himself to think of anything but the woman , who had already paused , as he had , to pass a word or two . How did hep257react to her beauty ? As a substance capable of being magnetized . She bounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understructure . " I 'm Myriad . " " Then I know your husband . " " Dear sheer Cyril . " " How 's his arm ? " " Fine , thank you . " " When I saw him , he was just taking it off . " " Were you startled ? He gets testy if people are n't startled . " " I tried not to show it . " " That was a mistake . " " I think he knew , because nothing testy happened . I 'd like to see ittake place again sometime , knowing the situation . I hardly got to seethe stump . I 'd be readier the second time . How 's the stump ? " " Very well , I gather . " " Did he define the word science ' yet ? " " He never tells me about his work , " she said . " What about you and your work ? " " What do you want to know , outside zorgs ? " " I 've been wondering if anyone could tell me whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sort of would-be minor goddess to look after people like you . " " I never heard of one . " " Young people need looking after , " she said . " Think of that beautifulboy Galois . People felt there was something secret in his character . They were right . The secret was mathematics . His father a suicide . His own death a horrible farce . Dawn in the fields . Caped and whiskered seconds . Sinister marksman poised to fire . " I need all my courage to die at twenty . " Then there was Abel , not much older , desperately poor , Abel in delirium , hemorrhaging . So often mathematical experience consists of time segments too massive to be contained in the usual frame . Lives overstated . Themes pursued to extreme points . Adventure , romance and tragedy . "  |p258I  will fight for my life . " Look at Pascal , who rid himself of physical pain by dwelling on mathematics . He was just a bit older than you when he constructed his mystic hexagram . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystic . That 's what 's so lovely about it . It 's able to become its own shadow . " Keep believing it . " The tricky thing about mathematical genius , " she said , " is that its sources are so often buried . Galois for one . Ramanujan for another . No indication anywhere in their backgrounds that these boys would one day display such natural powers . Figures jumping out of sequence . Or completely misplaced . " He tried to smell her , wondering what she smelled like , a woman this sensational , but the fruit on the trees in the area supplied a strong odor of their own , unpleasant , overpowering whatever shy variation of jasmine or sweet cicely might have flowed from Myriad 's pores . " Numbers have supernatural harmonies , according to Hermite . They exist beyond human thought . Divine order through number . Number as absolute reality . Someone said of Hermite : The most abstract entities are for him like living creatures . ' That 's what someone said . " " People invented numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withoutpeople . " " Good , let 's argue . " " I do n't want to argue . " " Secret lives , " she said . " Dedekind listed as dead twelve years before the fact . Poncelet scratching calculations on the walls of his cell . Lobachevski mopping the floors of an old museum . Sophie Germain using a man 's name . Do I have the order right ? Sometimes I get it mixed up or completely backwards . " " You went too fast for me to tell . " " The spirit of obsession . Is n't that the crux of it ? An entire life dedicated to a number , a figure , the properties of a geometric point . " " Too much obsession 's no good . " " I know you do n't believe that , " Myriad said .

He eased his way to the side of the baby carriage , in better position to look through the netting , if possible , in order to feed speculations , brain-crazy or not , on what kind of radical malformation of their baby 's body would force parents to acquire a carriage so unusually small , so obviously custom-made , so shielded by overhanging fabric . " Tell me about your mathematical dreams . " " Never had one . " " Cardano did , born half dead , his inner life a neon web of treachery and magic . Gambler , astrologer , heretic , court physician . Schemed his way through the algebra wars . " " Can I see the baby ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after getting out of bed . Vast intuitive powers but poor education . Taken to Cambridge like a jungle boy . " Though never less than stunned by her presence , all sepia and hoarfrostblush , he thought this woman slightly strange to be delivering such a grand harangue in the middle of a wood . Her remarks were somewhat formal and even vehement , as if she were trying to convert him , but as much as he liked the clear morning chime in her voice he knew he 'd have no trouble resisting the force of her propositions on the extramathematicalcontent of mathematics . A shadow-tailed arboreal rodent sat on a limb . The breeze freshened , creasing the gauzy fabric that covered the baby carriage . A sudden impulse made Billy want to run in circles around the woman and her perambulator . Run and whoop for the sheer stupidity of it , the utter dumbness , making a fool of himselfp260for the sake of foolishness alone . A lancer 's battle cry . A coon hunter 's halloo . Run and shout and fall . But Myriad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to stand and listen . Disagree if need be . Pout with ankles crossed like a mud-smudged little kid . The only thing that seemed inevitable was his presence at the lesson . " Sonja Kowalewski was n't allowed to attend university lectures . We both know why . When her husband died she spent days and days withoutfood , coming out of her room only after she 'd restored herself by working on her mathematics . Tell me , was it Kronecker who thought mathematics similar to poetry ? I know Hamilton and many others tried their hands at verse . Our superduper Sonja preferred the novel . Did I get it right this time or backwards ? I think I got it backwards . " " What 's my chances at seeing the baby ? " " It has all its parts , " she said , " and they 're all in the right places .

Rose-white woman , I want to die among your petals . He went back to his room and waited . Then he practiced his signaturefor a while . He kept expecting someone to turn up . Or a note to come under the door . Or a drawing or poem . Or a message scrawled on the teleboard screen . Or a videotape delivered in some extraordinary way . But things stayed quiet except for a remote monotonous sound , as of people engaged in minor construction , coming from somewhere beyond the exit grating in a corner of the wall.  |p261Robert  Hopper Softly was a child-sized man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into situations they would never have entered on their own . There was a distinct sense of authority about him . His body , pathologically stunted as it was , possessed to full extent misfortune 's power to reproach not only nature but symmetry itself .

He recollected his naive delight on establishing a relationshipbetween his name  --  the letters of first , middle and last able to be correlated one-to-one-to-one  --  and the cardinal number six . This same number , viewed a bit differently , was a special element in the set of positive integers , being a mathematically perfect number , equal to the sum of its divisors . Here was the kind of coincidence a child of subnormalgrowth might be disposed to treasure like a flawless stone . Odd that he 'd recall it now and even stranger the vestigial thrill he felt . He was wearing two thirds of his three-piece suit . His shirt sleeves were rolled up and he carried his suit jacket over his shoulder , index finger through loop , as he walked along the corridor . In his other hand was a belted leather briefcase , scraped raw in places , old enough to have been his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient romance , distinction and authenticity to be described as possessing moral and ethical substance . Inside were his hand-washables . Billy at this point was sitting in pajamas on the edge of his twofold , pinky finger at belly level , idly mining some navel sludge . He blinked a few times , his body trying to respond to the fact that it was technically awake . A moment later a voice filled the room . It seemed to have no definite source . It simply filled the room ( or was the room ) , an immensebuzzing voice accompanied by a tiny echo . " This is Knobloch reporting that a terrible mistake has been made . You were accidentally assigned to an experimental canister . The canisteryou 've been occupying is actually a giant sensor . It records yourp263heartbeat , your electrical brain activity , your oxygen intake , your eye movements , your cerebral blood flow and countless other functions that can be studied on EEG and similar tracings . Say I read ' if you read what I 'm saying . " " I read . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an experimentalbasis . You were put in there accidentally . The room is extensivelyshielded from outside interference . The walls , the floors and all the furniture are equipped with extremely superfine sensing devices . The only way you could avoid being traced would be to suspend yourself in midair . Literally everything you 've done has been recorded , measured and studied . Except we did n't know until now that the tracings we 've been getting belong to you . " " I read but do not understand . " " There 's a signal output terminal that processes all the EEG record runs from various clinical sites . We were interested in the tracings of a particular EEG subject located in a high scrutiny habitat . We were very interested in this subject . We monitored around the clock . But evidentlythe output terminal sent us your functions by mistake . We were n't interested in your functions . You 're not even supposed to be in that canister . That 's an experimental canister . " " Who is this other EEG subject ? " " Tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The ape . The chimp . That 's what they call him over in Zoolog . The chimp whose phonetic structure they 've rebuilt . We thought we were reading Tree Man 's tracings . But apparently we were reading yours . " " What do they say , my tracings ? " " That kind of information is confidential , " Knobloch said . " But now that we know you 're in the experimental canister , we might as well take advantage . " " Take advantage how ? " " This is Knobloch preparing to de-transmit . Please remain in your present position for further voice contact . Do not move except as necessitated . Excess movement causes static . "  |p264There  was a pause . " Good morning , " a second voice said . " This is D'Arco speaking . I am tall and rather fit , with finely chiseled features and eyes that bespeak a certain amount of worldly fatigue . Knobloch is stocky with pustules . While we 've got you there , we may as well try a little something scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't strayed too far from his archaic collective memories . A child , in other words . It would be perfect if you were half your age . But I 'm willing to grab what I can . " " I would rather I went back to work on the code , deciphering the code . " " No need to raise your voice , " D'Arco said . " I just want to be sure I am heard . " " By common consent the star code is no longer an ongoing project . I 'm amazed anyone took it seriously in the first place . Radio signals that were n't even repeated . A jumble of pulses . How can you do serious work with that kind of unreliable data ? What I 'm interested in is a particularsegment of your stage-four sleep . " " I have just now woken up . " " Sleep is a very active state , part of your waking life really . At times your heart rate and blood pressure soar . Your neural activity increases . There are rises in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pee-pee-maker gets hard and fluttery . Under closed lids the most important thing of all is happening ; your eyes are getting periodic exercise . Their rapid movements are coordinated in terms of conjugate function  --  a paired mechanism supplying a single vision . Without this exercise you might wake up to a double world . Which is the object , which the image ? They are paired one-to-one . " " Sleep is part of waking ? " " When you dream in stage-four sleep , you connect with your own racial history . You glimpse a portion of your earliest being . Perhaps this is why there is no stage four after a person reaches seventy years . This stage just drops off , like a rocket booster . The segment I 'm particularly interested in is called stage-four primal , which is characterized by a total lack of dream recall on the part of EEG subjects . Brain/wave tracings indicate that dreams do occur in stage-four primal . But no one has been able to remember one . With pregnant EEG subjects , we find bursts of fetal activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject 's primal dream and the fetus ' emergence from the uterus ? The structure of the atom was conceived in a dream . But it was n't a stage-four primal . Pure fable , myth , archetype , model , mold . This is how I characterize a primal . Dreams so shatteringly primitive the memory withdraws from them to relieve itself of responsibility . " Midway through D'Arco 's recitation , Billy got up and jogged around the room , testing Knobloch 's statement that excess movement causes static . It was true . The sound of D'Arco 's smooth deep enveloping voice was interrupted by random bursts of noise . He tried standing still and quickly raising his hand . A small crackling warp in D'Arco 's voice . Ile tried kicking his foot backward . A little hiss . " Being a nonadult EEG subject , " D'Arco said , " you have n't had time to drift away from your psychic origins , whatever these may have been , however replete with terror , darkness and fetal shrieks . Routine horripilation . We 'd like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into the twofold and sleep . Nothing will be attached to your body . The canister itself is sensor enough . All we want to do is record your stage-four primal . We want to learn what kind of dreams you have in that stage . " " But you said they 're never recalled in that stage , being the shatteringkind of dream . " " Very good , " D'Arco said . " You 've been listening . " " Also I have slept here ever since arriving . This means you already have plenty of tracings of mine . " " We thought your functions were Tree Man 's , which means we did n't activate the current that could electrically stimulate the flash points in your temporal lobes , thereby enabling you , on awakening , to experience flashbacks of scenes from your primal dream . " " Is that the same as remembering ? " " It 's better , " D'Arco said . " The details are much sharper . " " So what happens now ? " " You go to sleep.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read to you , " D'Arco said . There was a brief silence . " The history of zero is both interesting and informative , " Knobloch read . " It is thought that zero was discovered in India by a Hindu many , many years ago . It is the shadow of pure quantity . On one side of it are the positive integers ; semicolon ; on the other side the negative integers . Plus and minus , minus and plus . You are getting sleepy . Your eyelids are getting heavy . You are falling into stage-four sleep preparatory to entering an undiscovered primeval dreamscape . Zero is an element of a set that when added to any other element in the set produces a sum identical with the element to which it is added . " He dressed quickly and walked out , hearing , before he closed the door , the static caused by his movements across the room . He gave his body a moment to replenish its supply of oxygen , energy and whatever else had been disrupted by the prospect of simple sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Then he went to the nearest elevator , waited for the door to open , stepped inside and pressed a random button . When he stepped off he saw two workmen hurriedly installing an office door and another man disappearing around a corner with a paint can in his hand . Billy went the other way . Something about the area seemed familiar but it was n't until he walked past a barbershop that he realized he was in the vicinity of the hobby room . Pure luck , he concluded . Since this was a time of threat and since Endor 's room was padlocked , the hobby room represented a welcome refuge , even if second best . Stage-four sleep recorded and traced . His brain waves on paper . Bursts , flat lines , spindles , jagged flashes . Dropping off . Falling to an alternate surface . The hobby room looked the same as it had when he 'd encountered Siba Isten-Esru , the name shaman , Seven Eleven . Even the neon organ used in Ratner 's torch-lighting ceremony had been returned from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around . There was an eerie restfulness attached to being alone in a room of solid objects , this shadowy attic haunt so thick with reveries and dust . Weapons of holy wars . Pieces spilled from jigsaw puzzles . Trick decks of cards . Catgut , bamboo and iroko wood . He got off thep267vehicle and wandered into the depths of the room , passing among Victrolas , soda fountains and mummy cases . These last were very small , stamped oMCO RESEARCH , apparently designed for children , each case decorated with a chipped and faded likeness of the individual it once contained . In a steamer trunk he found a makeup kit . Among various pastes , wigs and cosmetics was a small black mustache , very somber , an emblem of anonymity more than a decoration , fit for a man who gravitatestoward the darkest corners of rooms . He placed it over his lips and used his index fingers to press down . It seemed to stick fairly well . Ile pressed again several times as he strolled past the organ and tricycle hack toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II , the latter flat-footed , long-limbed , head thrust forward , jug-eared , a quizzical look on its face , profoundly self-mocking , the very expression Billy had come to associate with scholarship , distinctive mastery in learning . Not that the ape was so nakedly akin to some master of the classics . Just ambiguous was all , or appearing to be , teasing the known world , reluctant to share its puzzlement . One paw was held by D'Arco , who was well past middle age , his neck veins extending like bridge cables from his throat to the point of his chin . Wispy hair grew on his autocratic knuckles . " Assuming you 're asleep , " D'Arco said , " your task at the moment is to wake yourself up . Just assuming , of course . Assuming you 're asleep . The idea is to wake yourself up , assuming you 're asleep , and identify the sound that corresponds to my voice . There 's a specific matching operation that goes on . " " I admit I do n't like this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the chance you 'll wake up with diplopic vision . This will happen if your sleep , assuming you 're asleep , is lackingin rapid eye-movements . You 'll open your eyes to a world in which everything is paired . No unpaired things in the whole world . Countable objects . A set of sets associated with the number we call two . Assuming you 're awake , which is no less likely , I should mention that this is the ape whose EEG tracings we thought were yours . " " The arms on him . " " His habitat is rigged exactly like your canister. "  | " Fingers , the toes . " " I think it 's time both of you were returned to your respective EEGstations . Assuming one of you is n't already asleep and being recorded . " " If I had a scissor , I 'd like to cut his toenails . Something about toenailsthat long makes me want to start cutting . What about you ? " " I 'm a busy man , " D'Arco said . Tree Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biting off the syllables as they emerged , slowly , units of digestive turbulence . " All in fi nite sets are in fi nite but some are more in fi nite than oth ers . " From D'Arco came an avuncular chuckle , little spit-divots sailing through the air . " The whole is e qual to one of its parts . " D'Arco wheezed at that , nearly doubling up . " Pretty droll bunch , those folks over in Zoolog , " he said . " I guess the brain adjustments and other work they did on the chimp could use some refining . But in the meantime I 'd like you to take my other hand . Want to be sure you get to your canister and into the twofold . " As D'Arco moved toward him , hand extended , Billy felt ready to cower and spring simultaneously . There was a noise in the corridor , someone running , the sound of a voice delivering essential news , and they moved into the doorway to see Knobloch coming toward them at top speed , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending , " he cried . " They 're sending again . They 're sending . " Fifty feet from the door he lost his balance and fell but rolled over smartly on his shoulder and was up and running again in the same motion , minus one shoe . He hobbled panting to a stop in front of them . " They 're sending , they 're sending . " " Who is sending and what is being sent ? " D'Arco said . Knobloch looked at Billy . " I hate you , " he said . " Why ? " " You saw me fall . " D'Arco clapped his hands a single time.  | " Who and what ? " " Radio signals . Extraterrestrials . They 're sending again . " " What 's the nature of these signals ? " " Fourteen pulses , a gap . Twenty-eight pulses , a gap . Fifty-seven pulses . " D'Arco sagged visibly . Slightly lopsided , Knobloch merely sweated and tried to catch his breath . Billy stepped back into the hobby room , certain this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we learned something here today , " he said . In the doorway the two men conferred . Billy wandered over to a small window in a far corner of the room . He looked down to one of the lawns and saw what appeared to be an impromptu parade . Two ragged lines of people . Some of them apparently carrying instruments . He was too far away , however , to hear any music . What he did hear , behind him , was Tree Man II padding down the corridor . When he turned he saw that D'Arco had also gone . This left Knobloch , stocky with pustules , to lead him to his canister , not before retrieving the lost shoe and putting it back on . In the canister he tucked Billy into the twofold and departed . In a matter of minutes his voice filled the room . " Say I read ' if you read what I 'm saying . " " I read . " " Who discovered zero and where was it discovered ? " " Hindu , India . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Preparing to record stage-four functions . Preparing to record , preparing to record . Is subject ready ? " " No reply . " " Preparing to count down . Subject is counting down . Subject is closing his eyes and counting down from zero . Subject 's eyelids are terriblyheavy . Subject is drowsy as he begins to enter stage one . We have low voltage activity at this time . Decreased amplitude , increased frequency . We are recording at a paper speed of fifteen millimeters per second . Preparing to receive stage-one tracings . Preparing to receive , preparing to receive . " It was at this point that Softly entered the room . There was a secondp270of brilliant stillness . Sensational , Billy thought . Colossal , tremendous , stupendous . The special presence of the man , his ascendancy , the seemingcontradiction of painful quaintness , were never more evident . He put down his jacket and briefcase . Then , as Knobloch 's voice continued to deliver technical data , he approached the limited input module , stepped on a chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned a silver dial . Knobloch 's voice went dead and the room was totally silent . He stepped down from the chair , picked a loose thread off his shirt cuff and then put on his jacket . Billy climbed out of the twofold , moving at once to his side . It was over , over , over . They walked together on the grounds . Billy carried Softly 's briefcase , as he 'd often done at the Center . It was a mild and windless day , sky high and bright , a day modeled on the rhythmic symmetry of a period of light before nightfall . When they entered the topiary garden they heard the ample blare of the parade as it steadily developed , then saw the marchers , dozens of men and women strutting in and out of the monkey hedges , most of them in costumes of various sorts , all wearing masks , men in one rank , women in the other , moving in twos , their masks improvised from newspapers , napkins , towels and sacks . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mouthhole , and other people played banjos , trombones , drums , clarinets and flutes . The noise produced was sufficiently dissonant to confirm the spontaneous nature of the event . In opera hats , bedgowns , bonnets , yellowslickers , periwigs , knickers and snoods they paraded under the sun , some of the " women , " seen now at closer range , appearing to be men in women 's clothing , as though to correct a deficiency and even up the pairings . A ten-foot muffler connected several necks . " I 'm willing to believe this is International Children 's Day , " Softly said . " There really is such a thing , you know . " " I did n't . " " They 've kept it from the children . " " I did n't know you were expected , Rob . You never told me a thing . What do you think of this place ? " " Needs a fluted column or two . But do n't get depressed , we wo n't be here much longer . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the details . " " Somewhere together ? " " Sure , together , absolutely . This whole operation needs to be drasticallyaltered . When I agreed with U.F.O. Schwarz that you were uniquely suited to unravel the transmission , I did n't know things would he handled so casually . There has n't been enough systematic thought put in on this . " " But I 'm a lot closer than anyone else got to a solution . The number they 're transmitting is what we would call fifty-two thousand one hundred and thirty-seven . I 'm sure of that and all I have to do is go on from there . " " From there to where ? " Softly said . They walked slowly across a level expanse of grass . Softly , forced to move in mechanical tick-tock fashion because of permanently dislocated hips , lifted a tin of small cigars out of his side pocket and lit one up . He seemed to haul himself over the ground , hitching with every step , his stomach working as hard as his legs to produce some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Star fields . Electrical fields . Metrical fields . Field equations . Unified field theory . The grass had recently been cut and possessed that nearly toxic freshness of nature in recuperation , a savor of arrow poison more seductive than the wildest lime . The two moving figures were about a hundred yards from the building , which was hard to look at in this midpoint hour , having been designed to play with light , to magnify and angle it in veering octaves so that the whole structure resembled a burst of solar art . " They mixed up my tracings with an ape 's . " " What kind of ape ? " " Chimpanzee . " " They 're the most intelligent , " Softly said . They sat on the grass to rest . Billy stretched back , face lifted to the sun . After a moment he became aware that Softly had taken off his jacket and placed it over his head so that his face was in shadow beneath the upturned collar . Always doing things like that , the boy recalled . Usually these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after some time had passed that he would realize there was an element of intelligence at work . In this case , he decided , it was Softly 's pale coloring that provided the motivation , his susceptibility to sunburn . " I think we have to attack the code in a radically different way . Howeverwe look at it , this is one of the most important events in the history of mankind . It has to be dealt with in the purest way possible . Do you see what I 'm getting at ? We have to be absolutely lucid . We have to be exact to a degree never before attained . The slightest intuitive content has to be eliminated from our finished work . See what I 'm leading up to ? " " Let 's have the gory details . " " One way of viewing mathematics is in terms of number . I guess you know what the other way is . I 'll say the word in a more expressive language just so there 'll be no doubt exactly what it is we 're talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Logik , " Softly said . That distinctive quality of parade music , a summons to come running , to gather together in public and allow whatever loyalty imbues marchers and band members to quicken likewise the communal spirit and reduce all colors to one ; that special emotion , as the music drops into time and distance , is swept pathetically away , to be replaced by a faint wonder at the depths of regret that often follow such fleeting revelry . " I think I feel sick . " " Logic is the scrub brush the mathematician uses to keep his work free of impurity . Logic says yes or no to the forms constructed through intuition . So-called intuitive truths have to be subjected to the rigors of logic before we can take them seriously , much less use them in our work : Remember , we 're dealing with beings of extraordinary capacity . How can we expect to communicate without a ruthlessly precise system of symbolic notation ? Now I know your accomplishments . I understand your feelings  --  do n't think I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 've done as a mathematician has been devoid of true depth . Brilliant instinctive skimming , to be sure . Unprecedented , in fact . But skimming nonetheless . We have to eliminate contradiction and go be/yond all those lax attitudes that make true scientists want to crumple up whimpering . " " I do n't like the sound of it . " " Neo-logistic , it 's called , technically . " " I definitely feel sick . " " Do n't get your balls in an uproar , " Softly said . Cigar smoke drifted out of the gabardine tent , not quite concealing Softly 's faint smile . In slow motion his left arm emerged from the jacket to give the boy a chummy cuff on the shoulder . " I find it interesting that Gottlob Frege produced his first landmark work on the logical foundations of mathematics exactly one hundred years ago . Almost as interesting is the fact that Einstein was born that same year . And that Dodgson published a book on non-Euclidean geometry  --  organized in dream form . Of further interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work being done on infinite sets about that time . " " Why is this interesting ? " " Because I find it so . " He dug a little hole for the cigar and gently buried it . Funny , dumb and strange . " As we redefine and strengthen , I think we 'll get closer and closer to the prospect of a genuine exchange with the extraterrestrials . We have to seek a level deeper than pure number . That much I 'm absolutely convincedof . So let 's not drag it out . " " I got halfway there , Rob . I found out they use a system based on sixty . I know it did n't take any complicated work to figure this out but that 's exactly the reason we do n't need this big change in our thinking . " " Even if you sit down and solve the code later this afternoon and solve it in a manner convincing to one and all , this still would n't mean we 've found an effective way of exchanging information with the extraterrestrials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the groundworkstarted on is a logistic cosmic language based on mathematical principles . " " It 'll take years and years until long after we 're kaput to even reach them out there with an answer . So what 's the difference ? "  | " That 's not the point , mister . Field Experiment Number One may smell like a brand-new shower curtain but its aims are important ones . If we 're going to behave as a single people , as rational human beings who inhabit the same planet , we desperately need goals and pursuits that can unite us . Finding a way to speak to intelligent beings on anotherplanet is one such pursuit . This place was n't called Number One accidentally . Others are being planned . Beacons in the shit-filled night . If we succeed here , we 'll be providing impetus for similar projects throughout the world . One , two , three , four , five . " " I need this speech ? " " You can make it work , " Softly said . " You with your one-of-a-kind touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and form , of hypothetical states , of the ways in which an isolated concept ties into the whole body of mathematics . Think of it . A transgalactic language . Pure and perfect mathematical logic . A means of speaking to the universe . Whatever small forays have been made in this direction in the past are about to be completely overshadowed by our efforts at Number One . " " I thought we were n't staying . " " It depends on events , " Softly said . " We 'll be here in general but elsewherein particular , I suspect . " They began to walk again . It was still possible to hear an occasional parade sound , very faint at this distance , tiny rips in the air , the brief repeated pop of tearing seams . Softly kept the jacket over his head . " I think we 're free to break off , split away , to follow a new course . In line with the rigorous approach I 'd like everyone to stop using expressionslike Ratnerians , " superbeings , ' extraterrestrials ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in touch with . If Moholean relativity is the real thing , the source is n't even where it seems to be . So why assume it 's a planet orbiting a star ? Remember the homely old adage : Belief in the causal nexus is superstition . ' So let 's from now on be sure to use the term artificial radio source . ' And let 's find a more precise name for the so-called beings who are presumed to have initiated the transmission . How about artificial radio source extants ' ? ARS extants . Just so we know what 's what . "  | " Getting tired ? " " From talking more than walking . Hard to adjust to the fact I 'm walking with someone who does n't tower over me . The size we share makes it easier for me to imagine you in the palsied grip of middle age , hee hee , which in turn makes my own years fall away like dry leaves . The fate of man , recto verso , is to go to his grave in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicinity of the cycloid structure . A woman opened the gate that led from a small enclosure known as the abstract garden . She walked toward them , carrying a small piece of luggageand some books . " Look at the ass on that . " " What ass ? " Billy said . " She 's coming toward us . " " I like to anticipate . " Softly put his jacket back on and they settled into adjacent chairs in the abstract garden . The paraders had evidently passed this way , leaving tokens of their frolic . A man with a pointed stick jabbed daintily at pieces of paper and stray fragments of costume . " So in conclusion , " Softly said , " what we 've got to do is restate and strengthen our method of reasoning . Make it exact and supremely taut . Introduce distinctions and fresh relationships . Argue our propositions in terms of precise ideographic symbols . Submit our mathematics , in short , to a searching self-examination . In the process we 'll discover what 's true and what 's false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very structure of our reasoning . There 's been no concerted attempt to eliminate slackness and ambiguity from the work you 've done up to now . I 've got news for you , mister . The goddamn fun is over . " They were alone in the small garden . The afternoon had lost some of its rabid glare . A smell of mown clover rose from the earth . It summoneda special presentness , that particular time-sense in which animal faculties conspire to rouse the spirit , the ordering force of memory , and Billy was stirred to relive some elemental moments separately blessed within the flow of past events . They could be counted , the times in which he 'd guided a length of string through the hole he 'd nail-scraped in a chestnut , the lumps of clay he 'd thumbed and gouged into some amorphous model , the cherry pits he 'd buried and people he 'd learnedp276to believe . They could be counted , the times in which he 'd flexed his toes in dense wet sand , the bites of ice cream he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoon , the caves he 'd made in his mashed potatoes , the pages he 'd detached from his composition notebook , tearing down along the row of wire rings , and the white flakes that bounced down out of the air as a result , also distinct and countable . They could be named and listed , the places he 'd hidden from danger , the nights he thought would never end . Softly got up , stretched and headed abruptly toward a remote rear entrance of the building . The boy followed , carrying the briefcase . It was n't until he walked toward the reflecting surface of an electronic door , now sliding open , that he realized he was still wearing the false mustache.  |p279Everywhere  dense the space between them seemed a series of incremental frames that defined their passion 's dark encompassment , man ostensibly engrossed in dressing , woman nude and on her side ( a horizontal dune anagrammatized ) , neither failing to be aware of the sediment of recent links and distances , that variable material suspended in the air , living instants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving to confirm the urgent nature of their act , the industry involved , the reconnoitering for fit and placement , the fundamental motion , the pursuit of equable rhythm , the readjustment ofp280original position , the effort of returning to oneself , of departing the aggregate , and in the slightly pasty daze in which they now remembered their fatigue , their sense of well-merited weariness , it was possible for each to examine even further the substance of that space between them , so reflective of their labor , the odors transposed , the strand of hair in the mouth , the experience of whole body breathing , the failure ( or instinctive disinclination ) to produce coherent speech , the bright cries , the settling , the eventual descent to slackness , the momentary near sleep in milkiness and cling , the recapturing of normal breathing tempo , the monosyllables and blocks of words , the raw awareness of the dangers of exchange , the oddly apologetic uncoupling , mutual recognition of the human demonologyof love . She rose from the bed , not without a glib tickle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her amazing buttock , the left , notable for its star-shaped birthmark . He sat atop a footstool , engaged in double-lacing his shoes , taking time between knots to watch her dress , an operation that seemed to portray the correspondence between positionand time , one action generating the next , step-in , shake-into , hoist-on , her limbs and torso covered now , fluidly moving woman , her eyes appearing to follow the delicate pebbling sound of Softly 's voice . She sat back on the bed as he spoke , the bottoms of her feet identically smudged with dust , arms enfolding her raised knees to form a body-hut that wobbled . Softly rubbing his pale stubble took time to glance inside the folder she 'd left propped against the footstool . He spoke a moment longer ( about terms , formulas , sentences and proofs ) , then got up and hurried out of the room , moving with his customary lurch . Had he happened to turn , a step beyond the doorway , for a final word or sweet and simple farewell nod he might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lover 's face . I TAKE A SCARY RIDEThe boy was packed and waiting when Softly arrived in his canister . His pants were pressed and he wore his good sport coat and tie . His fingernails were clean . The part in his hair was nearly straight.  |p281His  shoes were shined . The mustache was gone . While Softly nosed his way around the room as though they were about to move in rather than vacate , Billy picked up his suitcase and headed toward the door . " Not that way . " " What other way is there ? " " Straight down . " " Explain please . " He watched Softly approach the metal grating located near the base of the wall . This , of course , was the emergency exit point for the whole sector . Softly unclasped the grating and set it on the floor . " We ca n't go in there except for man-made or natural disaster , " Billy said . " They told me that . I nodded my head to show them I understood their statement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do I get to pick one ? " " I do n't like going down there for no reason . " " There 's an emergency all right . I thought all along this would happenand it has . Cable traffic is heavy beyond belief . " " So what is it , some kind of alternate physics situation or the bottom is falling out of space or water does n't boil at the boiling point anymore ? Because around here that 's the kind of emergency you get . " " Tensions , " Softly said . " What kind ? " " The worst kind . International tensions . Mounting international tensions . First there were states of precautionary alert . Then there were enhanced readiness contours . This was followed by maximum arc situationpreparedness . We can measure the gravity of events by tracing the increasingly abstract nature of the terminology . One more level of vagueness and that could be it . It 's not just a localized thing either . We 're dealing with global euphemisms now . Exactly how soon it 'll break out depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of nations , and y , the opposing block , slip out of equilibrium in terms of capability and restraint coefficients . We could frame any number of cutie-pie equations but we 've got more important work to do . " " So how far down do we go ? Is there a basement with a shelter right under here ? "  | " We go deeper . " " Where they keep the proton accelerators ? I think that 's about as far down as the building goes . " " Deeper . " " I know where . Where the balloon is that they keep in that big room , the balloon for astronomy . That 's about thirteen levels down . Or the Great Hole . We go to the Great Hole , right ? " " Deeper , " Softly whispered . " Deeper than the Great Hole ? " " What I find most satisfying about this structure is the fact that it comes in more than one part . The first , naturally , is the cycloid . The second is the first in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Same distance down as up . Nothing goes on down there in the sense of official goings-on . It 's nothing more than an excavation . But it fulfills the concept . " " I think I 'll stay here . " " I call it the antrum . Just a fancy way of saying hole in the ground . I 've had the floor of the excavation fixed up a bit . Just the bare essentials . And I 've selected the very best people to help us in our work . Every one a supersavant . It took all the persuasiveness I could muster . I think the world tensions helped . In this kind of chancy muddle everybodyagreed the only way to stay intellectually fresh was to put ourselvesin a state of total isolation . Consider yourself lucky to be working with these people . " " I 'll take my chances with the global phrase-calling . " " Follow me down , " Softly said . On his hands and knees he backed into the exit hatch . Billy handed down his suitcase and followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step over a series of sewer pipes to the edge of a catwalk . It was hard to see , the only light being provided by a dusty bulb . To one side was a stack of beams and thick boards set on sawhorses , all apparentlyleft by workmen . They crossed the catwalk and headed toward another light , avoiding puddles as they went . This time the bulb was inside an open shaft . Softly cranked a lever and eventually a small elevatorascended and stopped , roughly at their level . It was really thep283frame of an elevator , much of its wiring exposed , no paneling at all , a few yards of hexagonal mesh closing in all but one side . In this lame cage they were lowered into the excavation , a journey that took them through storage and maintenance areas , restricted sectors , down along porous shale and rock , past timber underpinnings and assemblies of masonry and steel that formed support for subtunnels and emergency access routes , the elevator suddenly dropping into open air , free of its shaft , cabling into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oscillation , a bucketing descent through drainage showers and rubblefall , the cage shaking so badly that Billy sought to convince himself there was a pattern to the vibrations and changes of speed , a hidden consistency , all gaps fillable , the organized drift of serial things passing to continuum . Gradually the elevator slowed down , steadying its descent . Then it fitted into its housing , a sort of armored toy-box located on a platform about a dozen feet off the ground . The riders stepped out and walked down makeshift wooden stairs to the very bottom of the vast excavation . An awful lot of trouble , the boy thought , just to fulfill a concept . A short distance away was a series of cubicles for working and sleeping . Larger units included a first-aid room , a kitchen , a primitive toilet , some field telephones . Everything was set on a slightly curved surface of clay and rock and there was nothing above but darkness . Oil drums , wooden crates and natural debris were set around the cubicles to keep dislodged rocks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , splashed and occasionally cascaded in the distance . It was cool down here but not uncomfortably so . The smell of earth was firm and gripping , mineral-rich , and humid air could be felt on the tongue like the taste of a lead penny . " Frightening ride , I freely concede , but better this than a block and tackle descent , " Softly said . " If we ever short-out down here due to flooding , that 'll be next . Up and down we go , sitting in a loop of highgraderope . " In Billy 's cubicle were a cot , a footlocker , a large shiny blocklike chair and a TV table on casters , this last item meant to serve as a desk . The partitions were about twice his height . There was no door , just anp284entranceway ; no ceiling ; a clay floor . Softly left him alone to do his unpackingand Edna Lown lowered herself toward a kitchen stool , moving slowly as befitted her bulk , a cigarette aslant at the corner of her mouth . He opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his things could be pressed and kneaded into the locker . The rest he left in the suitcase , which remained unclosed at the foot of the bed . Then he sat in the chair , not accustomed to free time , Lown 's blouse littered with pale ash from her cigarette . Softly took his ease across the table , watching her thumb through a sheaf of papers , hair fairly gray and worn in an uneven page-boy cut , clear eyes set in a broad strong face , sedately aging woman , tank-driver of the neo-logistic school , her thumb acceleratingthe page count now . " Where is he ? " " Cube one . " " Will he fold under pressure ? " " He 's my protege , Edna . " " What took you so long ? " " Had to talk to someone about some questions bearing on incidental matters related to the project . " " We work in absolute privacy , Rob . I wo n't give an inch on that . Neither will Lester . This seclusion business was your idea . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've got tendencies . " " We work without outside interruptions . That was and is my formal promise . " " When do we see him ? " " Anytime you 're ready , " Softly said . " Is that the latest notation work ? " " I 'm not happy with it . " " Of course you 're not happy . This is a revolution in the making . All science , all language wait to be transformed by what we 're doing here . I am the leader . Nobody 's happy until I 'm happy and I wo n't be happy until we 've finished what we 've come to do . " The boy did not move when they entered his cubicle . Softly sat onp285the bed . The woman remained in the entranceway , examining the apathetic figure in the chair . She wore glasses with dark frames and round lenses . " We expect this will be a long and intensely productive period for all of us , " she said . " I have n't even shut my suitcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Events are n't influenced by one 's wishful application of significance to commonplace objects . Whether your suitcase is opened or closed , we 'll be here quite a while . " " This is a lady dentist talking . " " Behave yourself , Willy . I told you the fun 's over . Edna Lown is here at my request , my entreaty , my urgent supplication . Learn from this woman . " " Naturally I 'm familiar with your work , " she said . " I detect a strong computational strain running through it . Not much sense of discrimination . Not much use for logic . Paradoxically yours is the kind of intellect we need . The basis of mathematical thinking is arithmetic . The whole numbers and how we use them . On the other hand the basis of arithmeticalthinking is pure logic . We can trace the foundations of arithmeticto a handful of logical propositions . It seems to be the rule for top people to come to mathematical logic only after considerable work in other areas . That 's nice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems to me if I remember correctly they got me here to explain a message from outer space . Do I keep on doing that too or do I just work on this other stuff ? " " You can play with the code in your spare time , " Softly said . " If you sincerely feel the ARS extants are using a nondecimal system , attack it from that angle . I think what they 're using is what we 're looking for . A universal logical language . Help us develop that and the code will take care of itself . " The woman spat a grain of tobacco from the tip of her tongue . " Mathematics is a model of precise reasoning , subject only to the requirements of an inner discipline , " she said . " It 's an annex of logic . Nothing more . All the rules of what we call number ' derive from logical propositions . Logic precedes mathematics . And since the fundamentalp286elements of logic have no content , mathematics has no content . Form , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The symbols we use are everything . What they represent we discard without the slightest misgiving . The focus of our thought , the object of our examination , our analysis , our passion if you will , is the notation itself . And this is what our work will involve to a large extent . It 's nothing you have n't done before really . The emphasis is on classes rather than numbers . That 's all . " " Is that all ? " " I enjoy listening to my logic-mongers talk , " Softly said . " They make the creation of an artificial language seem anything but difficult . Remember , Willy , the greatest work is both simple and inevitable . That 's my final word for the moment . I 'll leave you with Edna now . See you in a few pangs . " " What 's that ? " " There 's no day or night down here . The body makes its own time , usually very different from what we 're accustomed to . Waking time we measure in pangs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This refers to a Lester Bolin snore cycle . Lester 's Edna 's associate . The average full-length sleep is about half a dozen lobsecs . " " Do n't you think that kind of talk offends adolescents ? " " Willy , if you think Edna is sensible , there 's always Lester to contend with . I remember telling him once how interesting I thought it was that the first use of zero as a number probably took place a great deal earlier than the usual estimates would have it and in Indochina no less , where we can imagine a sort of common abstract boundary between the Taoist concept of emptiness and the Hindu notion of void . He flailed , literally flailed at the air . " " Of course , there was Cantor , " the woman said . " I 'm late for an appointment . " " After all the breakdowns , depressions and seizures , after he died , finally , did n't they find in his papers a statement to the effect that mathematicsca n't be explained without a touch of metaphysics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agree , " she said . " I just mean it 's curious enough to bep287interesting , not unlike your emptiness and void . What does our young man think ? " " If it 's in his papers , I guess that makes it history . " " History is full of interesting things , " Softly said . " It has no worthwhilestatement to make to us , however , in our current preoccupation . We 're permitted to deduce , at least at the outset , that everything is either a or non-a . What we 're not permitted to do is say that everything is either the Great Wall of China or something else . In our presentcircumstance we do n't even know the Great Wall exists . We 've never heard of it . So let 's forget about history . " I GET A LITTLE BACKGROUNDEdna Lown spoke for a time on the possible form an interstellarvocabulary might take . She pointed out that a " grammar " would have to be communicated gradually through the medium of radio signalsof different wavelength and duration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our synthetic language defining themselves as they were transmitted and , we trust , deciphered . There would be no inconsistencies or exceptions to rules . As we formulated our cosmic discourse , basing it on principles of neo-logistic thought , we could make our transmissions increasingly abstract and difficult , assuming , we hope safely , that those on the other end had correctly interpreted previoustransmissions . In this way we could progress from " a plus b equals c " all the way to a definition of " truth , " if indeed this word is subject to definition . The radio signals in combination would be the equivalent of a set of ideographic units written in Logicon . Connectives , binding variables , arrays of signs gradually emerge from the radio noise . The concepts of " plus , " " minus , " " equal to , " " is implicit in , " " can be interpretedas " soon accumulate in a solid body of planet Earth knowledge . He sat in the chair listening to her as Softly emerged from the shaft , hurried across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her room the young woman sat on her bed trying to make sense of the notes she 'd written earlier in the day . She seemed to have troublep288expressing anything resembling annoyance or frustration ; all such displayswere inevitably absorbed by her utter presentableness . Welltailoredpants and shirt . Trim figure . Roundish , soft and overpretty face . Whenever she gestured in the direction of vexation , the act automaticallyendowed itself with a glow of tomboyish pathos , much too adorableto be taken seriously . Hair coasting over the juncture of jawbone and ear , slightly upcurled , the palest of browns . Eyes overripe with sensibility . Softly was halfway out of his pants before he 'd taken a couple of steps into the room . " Let 's go , " he said . " What is this , a nuclear holocaust copulation drill ? " " I 'm in a hurry . " Softly seminude resembled a Roman sculptor 's serious jest . He appearedludicrous only to the extent that parts of his body were still bound in cloth . Elsewhere nothing was in miniature and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretchable sock , that naked he was even more imposing than when fully dressed , his chest fairly broad , his head more closely related in size to the rest of his appendages , an illusion fostered by the balancing factor of his sex organ , a piece of equipment that seemed to hold him together , structural bond and esthetic connective . " Rob , I 'm kind of busy . " " So am I , so am I , but I took time to come up here . You do n't have to undress completely . Just give me something to aim at . A suitable accommodation . " " Unfunny , " she said . " Come on , let 's get moving . " " These notes are all messed up . I ca n't read my own notes . How will I ever get a book out of this ? " SEE LESTER EXISTLester Bolin glanced at the envelope and strolled over to cube one , where his associate was saying that any civilization advancedp289enough to have constructed an apparatus for receiving radio transmissionsfrom other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpret any series of messages based on strict logic . In fact the artificial radio source extants would probably have less trouble understanding a message from Earth than we ourselves experience every time we try to decipher fragments of an ancient language found buried somewhere on our own planet . This seeming irony , she said , merely emphasizes the absence of logic in our spoken languages . " In any case Logicon is not designed to be spoken . As we go along we 'll doubtless see it reveal an innate resistance to being articulated . " " By humans , " Bolin said , standing in the entrance . " Lester 's been working on an experimental thing . He believes he can get it to speak Logicon . " " Sorry I 'm late , all . Cut myself and could n't stop the bleeding for the longest time . Is n't there supposed to be a limit for that sort of thing ? Coagulation ? Does n't blood clot on schedule or something ? " " How 'd you do it ? " Billy said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisting of a flat-edged cutting surface terminating in a handle . " " A knife ? " " If you want to put it that way . " " Lester 's notion of a joke , " Edna said . " Lester 's a joker . Except jokes do n't work very well down here . This is dead time . You ca n't cut it . Bolin was a large man who gave the impression of being unmade . It was n't simply that his clothing fit badly ; certain items either missed connectionswith other items or were connected in the wrong way . The back of one trouser cuff was stuck in his sock . The reckless knot in his tie failed to conceal the fact that his shirt was fastened , starting from the top , with button a in hole b and so on down to his belt buckle . Part of his shirt was tucked into his shorts , the elastic band folded over his belt for an interval of several inches . His hair was thinning up front and he seemed to want to pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal box . Minor rockf all on the north slope . Mushrooms , mosses , algae , phosphorescent fungus . The trancelike sleep of sated bats digest/ing upside down . Bolin stepped outside a moment , returning with a chair . Edna Lown stood a few feet to one side of the entranceway . The simple act of sitting was for Lester something nearly ceremonial , his rump and thighs settling ever deeper , investigating the chairness beneaththem , and Billy felt this was a man intent on compressing every second in order to discover the world-point within , a serious man , look how he enjoys his sitting , watch his scraping feet , see him exist , a man ( Softly mused , of sitting men in general ) concluding an infinite sequenceof states of rest to begin this period of self-limiting motion . Constanttemperature , humidity , darkness . " My husband , when we were married , " the young woman said , " did n't recognize my handwriting . We never left notes for each other . We never wrote letters , even when separated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that remarkable ? What we 've come to ? His own wife 's handwriting . My own husband 's . Both ways it worked . " " Is that why your marriage broke up ? " Softly said . " We forgot to have fun . That 's what happened . No kidding , we just forgot . There he goes . A fleeting figure in the dawn . " " And now you ca n't even recognize your own handwriting . " " I can recognize it all right . I know it 's mine . I just ca n't read it . So do n't draw full circles . " " Remember , you do n't talk to anybody unless I give the word . Edna will not like this . It will take every last ounce of my massive powers of persuasion . " " Is smoking allowed in this crate ? " " I want you to straighten out those notes so I can have a look . That 's the first order of business . Then you see my friend Terwilliger . Then we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I need Edna 's good will . This is a smuggling operation . You are being smuggled in . When you 're finished interviewing the boy , you will be smuggled out . " " I 'd rather stay in the antrum . " " You will be smuggled out , " he said . Serious people . No way no how , Billy thought , to avoid them in this setup . That one sitting inside his chair . The other one standing there in a blouse , a skirt and desert boots , her age and size wearing those tallp291shoes , not that you can blame her , this setup down here , not even any planks over the ditches . Envelope resting on Lester B. 's knees . Serious very serious . As Lester and Edna spoke of the discipline they would all have to exercise in order to succeed in this venture , Billy put his right index finger in his mouth and bit away part of the fingernail withoutdetaching it completely . He then used this jagged fragment to scrape dirt from under the fingernails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( left index finger , right hand ) , feeling good about the whole thing , partly because it seemed so ecologically sound . After a while he thought of his own funeral , another favored pastime , resorted to wheneverhis mood needed a boost , his self-esteem a measure of support . There he is in a heartrendingly cute casket lined with napped fabric , white and velvetlike . Everyone he 's ever known shows up for the wake . They stand about solemnly , shopkeepers and doctors of philosophy , dozens of boys and girls , colleagues by the score . Their sorrow at his passing mingles with his own self-pity ( as he watches ) . It 's fairly obvious . There 's not much doubt about it . Guilt . They feel guilty . What they feel is guilt . They bear this terrible guilt for not having treated him better , loved him more , valued his life above their own . Jerks . Inside the drained body little eruptions of rot are already taking place . What once was composed of water , fat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this moment undergoing structural alterationof the most extreme sort . Mulch , glunk , wort and urg . Nameless wastes . He felt a slight weakness in his upper arms , which probably explained why this part of the death reverie failed to entertain to its usual degree . " So what 's it like , " Lester Bolin said , " being a radical accelerate ? " " If that 's what I am , it 's the only thing I 've ever been , at least as far back as the time I first knew what numbers were , so I ca n't compare it with anything else , which is probably in general the thing you 're looking for , I mean more than , less than or equal to what it 's like not being a radical accelerate , if I heard the question right . " " In its own way , a remarkably exact answer , " Lown said . " Note the use of if , " only , ' at least , ' as far back as , ' anything else , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' less than , ' equal to , ' like , ' and finally if ' again . Good to excellent answer . " LESTER TELLS US ABOUT ROB " I 'm lowering my voice , so watch my lips . Softly . What Softly 's got is a nonhereditary child-size condition . Rare sort of thing . Diagnosed right from the beginning . He was an abnormally small baby , I mean really small , lopsided as well , badly proportioned . He said consideringwhat he looked like in infancy and early childhood he 's lucky to have emerged as a viewable ' adult . Apparently the thing was caused by a chemical imbalance in the mother 's womb . As I understand it , he 's not a dwarf per se . He told me this himself . I never expected to hear this kind of intimate revelation from someone like Rob . The problem with his hips was there from the start . Part and parcel . One night he just sat himself down and told me the whole thing . I admire the man more than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such negative conditions . Here , this was delivered to me by mistake . " He tossed the envelope on the bed and followed Edna Lown out of the cubicle . They stopped off in the kitchen , where Softly was pouring tea . " So ? " " He has to get used to us , " Edna said . " He will in time . Any trouble develops , let me know and I 'll work on it . " " How long have you known him ? " Lester said . " He 's been at the Center for a couple of years . I first met him several years before that . " " What about your other friend ? " Edna said . " Who 's that ? " " How long have you known her ? " " What other friend ? " " There 's a young woman in your cubicle . "  | " She 's sitting on your bed , " Lester said . " Surrounded by sheets of paper . Sorting them . " " No problem .

" A sort of general backgroundarticle on Logicon . Is that the idea ? " " Book , she 's writing a book . " " Rob , I do n't like this . " " It 's a little book , Edna . " " What else has she written ? " " Little books , " Softly said . " All her books have been little . " I READ MY MAILBilly decided to take a walk around the area . He got up slowly , envelope in hand , and went along the crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much here that he had n't already seen when Softly led him in from the elevator . He did n't go more than a few yards beyond the protective barrier of crates and oil drums . From this short distance the units for living and maintenance resembled a secure campsite , the only source of light in the giant earthen bowl . He was aware of the presence of water . Somewhere up on the slopes water was running along bedding planes and joints . Maybe it was right under him too , dripping into hollows , seeping , cracking rock apart , collecting and finding outlets , only yards below , wells and falls , deep pools , wide living rivers . He sat on a rock and looked for the first time at the front of the envelope Lester Bolin had given him.  |p294Consortium  Honduriumc/ o Liberian Ship Registry Inc .

" Hi . " " H'o . " Her visit was brief and the interview she conducted , although it had its opaque moments , was pretty easy to take . She rolled the TV table over to the chair and took notes as they talked . Billy sat on the bed , his back against the partition . " I 'm Jean Sweet Venable . I 'm sure Rob 's told you about me . " " Terwilliger , William . " " I 'm sure you were warned about a writer on the prowl . " " Never heard of it . " " Rob gave me permission to research this whole project and eventuallydo a book .

" " I 'm fairly well known in my own right . " " For what ? " " My books . " " Have I heard of them ? " " So I do n't think this is a case of somebody keeping somebody else on the side . Eminent Stammerers . That was my first . Got a fair share of attention considering the limited scope of the subject matter . I 've done scores of magazine pieces . " " Anything else I might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Gobbledygook Cook Book . " " Sounds familiar . " " Fourteen weeks on the list . " " Not bad .

" I want to know what happens inside your mind . What is mathematics ? Poincare talked about getting flashes . Do you get flashes ? He also said , I think he was the one , that mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things . " There was a trace of hoarseness in her voice , of lightly sanded cunning , somehow at odds with her appearance . Certain words she spoke seemed almost to vibrate with the kind of ironic connotation difficultp298to isolate from its sexual core . There was in addition an offhand and even cavalier element to her note-taking . She scribbled what he said . Line after line of catchpenny scrawl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was just thinking ahead to the next question . " What else should I ask ? " " I write using big letters . " " I like it , " she said . " Now this business of deciphering what the ARS extants are saying . Is this being abandoned in favor of the Logicon project ? " " I am keeping going on it . " " You 're a good subject , " she said . " Give me some more like writing in the dark with big letters . Most subjects insist on telling me about every so-called fascinating job they 've had since the age of puberty , or what good athletes they used to be , or the year they spent in a beach house in shorts . I much prefer the offbeat item . Give me more , give me more . " She liked to stand clutching herself as she talked . Hands under oppositeelbows . Only one hand to elbow if she had a phone or drink in the other . Leaning back against the nearest large object as she talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head sometimes tilted left . Jean believed in very little . All around her all her life people went around believing . They believed in horticulture , pets , theosophy and yogurt , often in that order , flickeringly , going on to periodic meditation , to silence and daunted withdrawals . Despite their belief in staying single they all believed in marriage . This was the collectivization of all other beliefs . All other beliefs were located in the pulpy suburbs of marriage . To entertain other beliefs without being married was to put oneself in some slight danger of being forced to be serious about the respective merits of these beliefs . Dishevelment would result . True belief . The end of one 's utter presentableness . Recently ex-married , Jean had not yet detected flaws in her presentableness . But this was because she had not yet experienced the onset of the danger of belief . The links were thrilling if indeed true links , if more than mere envisioned instants .

So , if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being en/camped by now in Softly 's cubicle , " sorting impressions , " trying to read " notes , " there would have been on display some related version of that casual posture , that sleeveless V-neck sweater , that knit shirt , the acute crease in those flannel pants . Her husband had left without warning one morning . No hint since of whereabouts . All around her people accused him of cowardice . If willing to grant this , she realized she would have had to concede the corollary , that to live with her in wedlock required courage . ( Is that really logical ? ) A certain marital valor . An intrepidity and grit . She did n't hate him , miss him or wonder where he was . Never a thought of some swell revenge . Among the things she did n't believe was that we learn from experience . Nothing of value accrued to her from the fact of his disappearance except for one insight , that there seems to be in men a universal mechanism , a preconscious warning hum that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior life . And so each man she met , on being told of her husband 's sudden departure , would himself suddenly depart . It began to take on the rhythm of a biological cycle . All of them assumed she had made life unbearable . No doubt an expert in chaos administration . A magic-wielding bitch despite her utter presentableness . Discovery of the chromosomal hum did not interest her much , being useful only when she was in bed with someone she wanted to wake up in bed without , in which case she had only to remember not to go to sleep without first mentioning that one morning without warning her husband had left . All around her all her life all the others believed , forever attending classes to solidify old beliefsand obtain knowledge that would lead to new beliefs , grown people going to school for instruction in coloring with goo , in lifting the dress to sit on the pot , in spitting out buttons to prevent strangulation , believers , flickering .

" BILATERAL SYMMETRYIt had been Bolin nonstop for a solid hour . Maybe more , maybe less , hard to tell . Billy thought he saw a light high on the southwestgradient , there and gone , a pale beam shifting . He was in his chair . Lester Bolin was sitting on the ground at the juncture of two partitions . Bolin on bilateral symmetry . Bolin on symbolic notation . Bolin on the subject of uniforms . Team jerseys with LOGICON sewed across the front . His left leg was bent at the knee , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompaniment to his remarks only to raise his left hand from time to time in order to simulate a grooming motion over the scrubby tract above his forehead . Exact correspondence of form and constituent arrangement on oppositesides of a dividing line or plane , Softly thought . He rejected the idea , never proposed , that there might be someone or something on the other side of an imaginary median line to match his parts and their relationshipsand into which he might theoretically flow . He was bundled into his bed , thumb-sucking , trying to stifle the chill that had penetrated his body on the most recent descent . Several blankets and a thick quilt . His thermal jammies . In the kitchen Lester was boiling water for tea . Edna was out near the barrier trying to get the shower to work properly . In cube one , the boy was unwavering in his marsupial sulk . Fill fill fill . Softly thumb-sucking made a series of tiny plectral sounds , as though pinching an inflated balloon . He felt a period of depression coming on . Arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense gloom . He consoled himself with the thought that it would n't last long and more pointedly with the clinical knowledge that a person afflicted with cyclothymia , the technical name for this condition , was known , ofp301all things , as a cycloid . How utterly lovely . What depths of stability and equivalence . What splendid Einheit or unity . Day and night of manic-depressive psychosis . Sun , heat , maleness . Moon , shade , femininity . Bless all Celestials and may they dualize forever . Pangs and lobsecs . He took his thumb out of his mouth , stepped from bed , opened the briefcase that held his hand-washables , felt around among the underwear and socks and came up with a small cylindrical inhalator . It was trademarked NorOmCol and had a screw cap , which he removed in some haste . He fitted the device high into his left nostril and squeezed once , I went to a Chinese restaurant to get my laundry back , releasing a colorless vapor . Whoosh . Wonder what a microscopic view would resemble . Noradrenalin transmission appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reabsorb . Active brain , racing pulse . Is this stuff psychoto-mimetic is the question . Or is it " madness " - inhibiting ? He put on an old robe and slippers , pondering which came first , state of mind or effect produced by chemical agent , his nostril pleasurably scorched . I went to a Chinese restaurant To get my laundry backThey served it up on the half-shell Without the usual crack : Yan tan hoakery pokeBloody hum de dunDivy tivy artichokeYou are it went into the kitchen , where Bolin was pouring tea for Edna Lown , who sat before an ultraviolet lamp . Waving off a cup of tea he circled the table a few times before climbing a stool near the entranceway . Edna wore sun goggles . " Laughter , " Bolin said . " What do you mean by that ? " " Ha ha . Just another way of saying ha ha . " " Why do n't you simply laugh ? " " I am laughing . Ha ha . A sound indicating amusement or glee .

An adjective is heterological if it denotes something that does n't apply to the adjective itself . What about the adjective " heterological " ? Is it heterological ( this is Softly thinking ) or not heterological ? Let 's work our way through the successive reflectionsof this logical dilemma . The mind that makes it to the other side need n't concern itself with bodily parts and whether they match or not . For is n't it true , historically ( I permit myself to slip , this once , through my own blockade ) , that people have maintained a fascination for the subplot of erotic potential in small bumpy misproportioned men ( not that I wish to exaggerate my own unevenness ) , perhaps suspecting us of possessing cyclic drives and impulses traceable to our more " natural " state of being ; that is , our obvious lack of grace ( which means , here , both effortless movement and divine favor , stressing the latter ) ; or believing us capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfillment , incubus asquat on the belly of a sleeping woman . " Sign over Spanish barber shops , " Lown said . " Algebrista y sangrador . Bonesetter and bloodletter . Trying to solve the flow . " The slope was dark . There were matches and candles in the pack , however . A crack of flame by the light of which a man might refuel a carbide lamp . At her desk Edna removed the heavy glasses she wore and then reached down and unlaced her desert boots . An unspoken sigh rose through her frame . The easeful stress of mellow bodies settling . Eyes closed now . Lips moving : broad-stroked Mayan lips moving slightly . What we conclude must be true in all possible worlds . True false . Tautological contradictory . Easier to reason without a sense of passing time . No systematically recurring event such as sunrise to provide a means of measuring an interval . Rest now rest . Continuous variable .

Edna had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult , living with husbands , wives and real children in suburban Bellevue or some slight variation thereof . ( Where 's gramma , dad ? She 's living in a cave , shut up . ) This piece of furniture was all that could be scavenged in the way of a desk , being a former chair taken apart and put back together by Lester Bolin inventively rearranging.  |p303Des|pite  the constant need for enterprise , the lack of material comfort , she liked it here . This was true work , what her life was all about , a summation , the terminating act of a long career that had often verged on greatness . The careers of each of them  --  Lester , Rob , herself  --  had proceeded along fairly similar routes , touching here and there , pausing to curl one inside the other , ever so lightly , never before this close to braiding together in a significant way . The atmosphere of crisis would prompt them to work harder and better . The lack of comfort . The imposedproximity . Rest now rest . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space they studied each other intently , parents of their own bodies , listening to the listener , all gravid with formal deduction . She opened her eyes . Maurice Wu . And put her glasses back on . Yes rested well rested . Time to shake off the dross of ordinary language . Maurice Wu squatting in the guano fields . She heard Bolin begin to snore . What she found truly remarkable was the fact that it had taken her so very little time to adapt to these ridiculous living conditions . On a typewriterstand in Bolin 's cubicle was an old Royal portable with a sheet of paper sticking up out of the roller . Set on the ground between the legs of the typewriter stand was a shortwave radio . Next to the stand and the radio was a small plastic desk . On the desk was a framed photograph of Lown and Bolin formally posed on a small lawn on some campus somewhere , each of them half turned toward the camera and half facing the other person , hands behind their backs , Edna 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise set forward , the photographer 's insistence on balanced composition ( whatever the level of humor intended ) evident most of all in the centering element of the entire picture , this being a waist-high twin-handled jug of indeterminate markings , each handle pointing ( as it were ) toward one of the standing figures . Above the radio , the stand , the antique machine , the desk , the photograph , draped across the full length of one partition , was a banner inscribed as follows : BREATHE ! GLEAM ! VERBALIZE ! DIE ! He completed the mixture , relighted the lamp , fitted it once again to the miner 's hat . He put his work gloves back on . He snuffed the candle.  |p304He  put the candle back in the pack . Getting to his feet he shouldered into the pack and put the hard hat back on his head . Besides the gloves , helmet and pack , he wore coveralls , kneepads , high socks and climbing boots .

ROB DOES A TRICKSoftly fully dressed went to cube one . He was thinking of Jean Sweet Venable aswarm in bedsheets hundreds of feet straight up . Of her works he had read only The Gobbledygook Cook Book , deeming it serviceably useless ; a good example , in other words , of what he expected ( and would demand if need be ) of her current assignment . He found his protege in the stiff gleaming chair , sitting with legs crossed , a novel posture for the boy . " Is there anything I can do to cheer you up ? " " Stand on your head . " Softly did this , fairly easily , not without first putting a folded towel on the spot where his head would settle . Showing little strain he righted himself . Then he sat on the towel , an act evidently requiring more effort than the headstand did . " What else ? " " That 's enough for now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'm trying . " " We need you .

" " Oriental gent , " Softly said . Sooner or later he had to get up and go to the toilet . On his way back he heard his name called . It was Lester Bolin speaking from bed . Billy approached the entranceway of Lester 's cubicle . He saw the banner , thep308photograph , the typewriter , the radio , the man himself , the narrow bed consisting of canvas stretched on a collapsible frame , the sheets and blankets at one end of the bed , bunched up , supporting Bolin 's head . Lester wore a sport shirt and pajama bottoms . " How do you like it down here ? " he said . " Like it ? " " Hate it . " " Intensity , " Lester said . " Everything 's so concentrated down here .

Cave openings all along this route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the slopes of the excavation contained a number of megaderma , or " false vampires .

Whole lot of sucking going on . Which could be the reason , thought Wu , why medieval gnome-worshippers in the moun/twins of central Europe believed that the crystal mixture of hydronuagnesiteand water possessed distinct medicinal properties and may have been right , they might , for was n't it used centuries later to stop the flow of blood ?

" " Do you really have a temperature ? " " They 're common for my age , " he said . " Growing takes place with a fever . " " That 's quite a stack of reading you 've got before you .

It compensates for lack of sunlight . You can borrow my goggles if you promise to return them . " " What does Lester Bolin want to be known as ? " " Mr. Bolin , " she said . Once she 'd been a character in a novel . How distressingly strange it was . The woman in the book was n't like her at all , at all . Yet she 'd recognized herself immediately . Such essential differences . The name he 'd given her . Impossible to think of herself with a name like that . The one word of dialogue he 'd written . Nothing at all like something she might say . But she 'd seen herself at once . Jean Sweet Venable . The mind of the character was completely unlike her own . The clothing . The body . The mannerisms . A carefully wrought set of individual mannerisms . Carefully . Wrought . But they were n't hers , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself at once despite the differing circumstances , setting , dialogue , mind , body , clothing and mannerisms . What was it he 'd done to bring her face to face with this representation she tried so forcefully to deny ? How did he manage it ? Son of a bitch . What did he know ? Nothing more than anyone could learn by sleeping with someone . My star-shaped mole . That was the only thing she 'd recognized as being literally hers . The character sat in cafeterias . The character was disheveled . She sat at tables still wet , bearing the elliptical traces of a washcloth . People talked to themselves . They pushed food into their mouths with their hands , pecking at their own fingers , never less than watchful of the possibilities of theft and death , poised cunninglyover free glasses of water . They all carried shopping bags . The character was surrounded in her cafeterias by men and women with shopping bags and none of them shoppers , none at all , not one . It said so in the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry after days of poking through trash cans . Collectors ( talking to themselves , force-feeding ) of bottles , cartons , bags , paper cups and other terminal necessities . Those without empty dented milk cartons will learn how foolish they 've been when the time comes . Emblematic birthmark on the buttock . This was the only thing , superficial or otherwise , he 'd used as perceived . This and her inclination to predict . Jean loved top311make predictions . On marriages , divorces , breakdowns , booms and crashes . It was not these similarities , however , but other things , merely superficial in the book and resembling nothing she 'd ever said , done , thought about or looked like , these other things , it was these that impressedon Jean a sense of resemblance between her and the character based on her . How painfully strange it was , searching the pages for signs of her own persona . Surfaces , guise and conscious intentions . The kingshipof printed fiction . Its arbitrary power . Its capacity to gain possessionof a person or thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The character sometimes sat all night in doorways . The character 's underwear stank . The character was never far from the presence of ugliness , the physically ugly , from the plane of misshapenness . She , Jean , carried air-mail stamps in her handbag . She had a shoetree for every shoe . What did he know ? How much and how ? Son of a bitch bastard . Softly pushing in and out . Defenseless love is suicide . Under that open sky nothing falling survivesthe rigors of identification . Where once men and women sought communion in sexual love , innocent of the need for programmatic valuation , they now deploy themselves across a level of existence composed of silences and daunted withdrawals . The theme of modern love is isolation . No longer is the lover prepared to experience sentimental pain , that traditional embellishment that gives desire a degree of symmetry . We did not fall into the trap of matter in order to be redeemed by love and thrust upward into the world of pure form . Clearly we did not , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious chrism of their life together , as nature partaken , the rayed balsamic flowers worn by a woodland god . Sex is painted on the very walls , spread on white bread . Lovers , then , once their secret language has been despoiled by synthetic exchange , are forced to disengage their love from biology and keep it in seclusion . What replaces erotic language ? Oral sex , she answered brightly . Tongues wagging in appointed crannies . Lap , pal , left to right . Unsuspecting mouth devoured by the genitals to which it presumes to communicate its moist favors . Defenses must be built to save the lovers from what unfolds around them and then againp312within their love itself to shelter each from the other 's patent treachery . What is defenseless love but an invitation to nipple-pricking pain ? Knowing the rules , we all shout at the jumper to jump . On the other hand , she thought , love does not speak to theorists .

In the boy 's cubicle Maurice Wu stood leaning with his elbow up high against the partition , hand on head . " Understand you 're running a fever , Willy . " " Hello , Rob , " Wu said . " Hello , Maury . Hi , Willy . Understand you 're running a fever . " " It 's not much . " " Starve it , " Softly said . " Okay . " " What do you think of Maurice ? " " I barely met him just now .

The horse stalls they 'd turned into dinettes . The haymows were now sleeping lofts . They 'd found a hand-cranked washing machine and made an end table out of it . Elevator descending . A plant stand was formerly a butter churn . They bought Tiffany glass for their spirit lamps . A Civil War whiskey barrel became a pre-Revolutionary soup tureen . Conclusions must follow necessarily . We must compel acceptance of conclusions . " Did you know you 'd get the prize ? " Jean said . " I had a hunch . " " Where were you when you heard the news ? " " At Rob 's house . " " Give me more . " " I was sitting in a chair . He came in and told me . Then we shook hands . " " That 's not too terribly interesting , " Jean said .

" " You 're not giving me anything to pounce on . You were a better subjectlast time . " " Talk about pouncing , better not bring your husband around if you have one . Rob does n't care what he says in front of husbands . " " Our marriage failed for lack of fun , " she said . " Fun is the only way to survive . A marriage is doomed without it . Think of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You have to renew , renew , renew . It 's time that wrecks marriages , obviously . For a long while we managed well . This is because we made sure we had fun . We played tricks on each other . We stuck out our tongues . We called each other on the phone and used funny voices . These were n't necessarily impulsive acts . Often there was a great deal of premeditation involved . We thought it was essential to do these things and so we worked at it , we worked at it very hard , so very hard . And it was successful for the longest time . " " But then you ran into trouble . " " We used to scare each other a lot , " Jean said . " Of all the kinds of fun , this was probably the one that worked best . Jumping out of doorwaysat each other . Pretending to be dead .

One morning he got up and left as usual . He always left before I did . I can barely remember his face but I know he left early , he liked to leave early , he liked to be the first one in the building to hit the streets .

" It was n't sex at all . Sex was the least and best of our worries . " " How many times a night ? " In the kitchen unit they worked and talked . Cigarette ash was scatteredover Lown 's blouse . She slipped her feet out of the desert boots and discussed Lester Bolin 's latest work on notation , which she consideredfar too cumbersome , overburdened with content . It was pleasant to sit with Rob and Lester , exchanging ideas and objections , seeking to extend the technical possibilities of their method by making it ever more reductive . " It 's like doubling to get half , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A series of doubled reflections gets continuallysmaller by half . I do n't think we 'll be rewarded with a sense of genuine precision until we get as close as possible to a kind of beneficiallycorrective infinite regress . Lester , I think you 'd profit immensely by clearing your work through our young man . " " I showed him some stuff very recently . He just walked out . It seemed to depress him . I 'm anxious to work with him but he just is n't interested . I wonder if we really need him . Do we really need him ? " " I 'm reminded of a family that lives across the road from me in Pennyfellow , " Softly said . " Years ago they adopted a very small child , an Asian girl , orphaned by the bombing . In a matter of days she became the focus of that home as none of the natural children in the family ever did . This is because she possessed something unique . Moral authority . Time and again I heard one member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always saying in effect : What will Phan think of us when she 's old enough to understand ? ' Remarkable , the sheer authority of that small round object . Because she was tiny , virtually mute , because she was Asian , an orphan , a victim of war ,  |p317Phan  was the ultimate moral force in that household , a living contradictionof nearly everything the family had once held to be eternal ; that is , justice , truth , honor , so forth . Now I do n't say my pal Willy is a moral force exactly . But I do believe his presence here has extramathematical significance . True , as Edna says , mathematical thinking is based on the whole numbers , Willy 's specialty , and it 's also true that his powers extend to related areas and that once he gets deeply involved in what we 're doing here he 'll probably put us all to shame , his mind working like a beam of light searching out a target . But Lester , when Lester asks whether we really need the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're dealing with a form of mathematics that substitutes classes for numbers . This is what makes him reluctant to enter . He knows he may have trouble finding his way around . Nevertheless I maintain we absolutely need him . He 's our living contradiction . His intransigence speaks against us . We need him to balance things . He 's the listener , the person we need to judge what we do . This is the power of the young . They know what 's right , if not what 's left . " " It 's unlike you to put things on a human level , " Edna said . " Does it erode my formal authority ? " " It 's a pleasant change , truth be known . " " Jean Venable would like to spend some time with you and Lester . Journalist I told you about . Briefest of interviews . In and out . Give her a feel for the subject . " " Sorry , " Edna said . " Everything she writes crosses my desk . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " I do n't think so , Rob , no . The last thing we need is that kind of distraction . " " I 'm going back to work , " Edna said . " How 's it coming ? " " Fair to good . " " The boy will respond , " Softly said . " He 's very young . These are strange circumstances . He 'll come around . Wait and see . " Lacing her boots she thought how close they 'd be coming in the finalp318stages to the rudiments of primitive number systems . Repetition , order , interval . Lester 's shoes were scuffed and battered and she could see them pressing into the earth , which was his way of thinking and working , a concentration downward . Softly 's shoes were quite immaculate , set neatly parallel , almost touching , his feet swinging in little arcs several inches off the ground . She began to rise , cigarette in mouth , as Billy went through the handwritten notes she 'd left him . The first phases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composeLogicon will eventually have to be recoded in the form of suitable radio signals . What we have then , he read , is English to Logicon to radio-pulse idiom or systematic frequency fluctuations . The statement " every number has a successor " becomes asterisk-N ( or some such ) in Logicon ; this in turn , pending advice from the technical end , becomes something like pulse-pulse-gap , the point being that with a few key modifications , a juxtaposition here , a repetition there , we can establish a scheme of affirmation and negation , assent and denial , giving simple " lessons " in number and following up with some kind of basic information as to where we are in time and space . The most likely thing we 'd have in common with the ARS extants is interest in numbers and in celestial events . Earth people , who differ widely ( spoken and written languages , etc. ) , share use of the Hindu-Arabic number system . Also it 's instructive to note that calendar-making is one of our earliest cognitive labors and evidence of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought , how the integers , which are discrete , and our attempts to chart time , which is continuous , may well combine to give us a common area of reference with extraterrestrials . However , if she correctly interpretedthe remarks on Moholean relativity made by Softly some time earlier , it was plain that we here on Earth do not know the location of the artificial radio source . So either we must figure it out or wait for them to tell us . In fact she did n't really care whether we ever replied to the original signal . She viewed the Logicon project as an intellectual challenge and nothing more . An advance in the art of mathematical logic . A breakthrough in economy and rigor . The transformation , in Softly 's phrase , of all science , all language . She had no strong conviction that Logicon was essential to celestial communication . It would be , inp319her view , a breathtaking addition to the body of human knowledge , period . As far as she was concerned it might be easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of discourse , no matter how strictly logical . Her handwriting began to collapse and he read only one more section , this being Lown 's estimate of how the expression " a plus b equals c " might actually be transmitted . There would be a pulse followed by a double time interval to indicate an operation pending , in this case addition , the plus sign itself signified by a particular kind of beep or dash . Repetition , order , interval , she thought , continuing to rise from the kitchen chair . FEMALE HAIR DOWN THEREHe heard Lester Bolin begin the first snore cycle of this particular sleep period . His things , Billy 's , were still divided between the footlocker and the suitcase and he did n't know and had no intention of finding out in which of these containers his pajamas were located . There was a single light in the antrum right now and it originated in the cubicle farthest from his , a periodic surge of candleiame , Softly 's quarters , diagonally across the path . He heard a sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle impact somewhere on the slopes , repeated more than once . He stepped out onto the path and immediately saw somethingcome over the barrier and bounce several times , barely visible , its forward motion ending in the gravel and soft clay , the object spinning in place , a rubber ball , eating out a slot for itself , unmistakably a Spalding Hi Bouncer , still rotating as he walked toward it past Maurice Wu lodged in a sleeping bag in a corner of his cubicle , past Edna Lown motionless in her bed , past Lester Bolin asleep on his cot ; a spaldeen , as it was commonly known , just an ordinary faded-pink rubber ball that had bounced down from the top of the excavation . He picked it up and turned toward the opening of Softly 's cubicle , detecting motion in the shallow glow and knowing what it was before he actually sorted out the allusive shapes . Jean Sweet Venable was in bed with Rob , moving over and around him , uncomplexioned in the dimness , a fine/grained and purposeful figure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very notion of " female hair down there " had long been a source of contemplative ache and wonder ; to see it , actually set eyes upon a woman 's pubic hair , filled him with a stunned hush , a reverence for the folklore of the body . But what they were doing now , man and woman , had no connection to beliefs , legends or culture . It seemed to him that the sex act was something no one could make up in a story . He watched reluctantly , afraid they would perform some variation of the act , assume a position of such deft fury that he might once again grow feverish , his mind and body unequal to the burden of sexual possibility . That people might do nameless things to each other caused him some concern ; he did not care to witness the unimaginable , particularly as it applied to crypts and fissures of the body . For the moment , at least , the lovers remained within the limits of his own borrowed knowledge . It was hard work , sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose . They seemed to be striving toward something that existed beyond a definitive edge . Her legs were ill-adapted to this event , too long , the sole flaw in the composite . Odd how the force of Softly 's physical innocence produced abnormality from model proportion . Jean 's breathing became more rapid and she began to speak as though in tongues . It was here that the lovemaking abandoned its industriousmanner , its claim to uniformity and craft , and started to resemble an act of appalling power , an incoherent labor meant to be performed in the dark or near-dark . He was in awe of what they were doing because they themselves seemed driven to it and lost in it . Her head at a slant , her body moving loosely beneath the impetus of Softly 's more systematic cadence , Jean continued to utter fabricated babble , terrible for Billy to hear because he did not associate it with intensely compiled delight but rather with an obliteration of self-control and the onset of an emotional state that bordered on prophetic frenzy . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought and repetition . The sex act did not have organized content . It was unrelatedto past and future time . It was essentially unteachable . It did not represent anything or lead necessarily to a conclusion , a sum , a recognitionthat someone or something has been part of a structured event.  |p321No  one could have made this up if it had n't actually been known to occur , whatever it was , whatever the body 's need for this brief laboring void . He began to back away now , Jean 's voice winding down , Softly thinking : 011eke bolleke Rubisolleke011eke bolleke KnullBack in cube one he tossed the ball into the open suitcase and sat in the chair . Bolin had stopped snoring and stared into the darkness directly above . He and his wife were the kind of people other people liked to describe as being devoted to each other . But he rarely thought of her now . She was in the converted barn and he was in the antrum . " Say something . " " I thought you wanted me to shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maurice Wu slowly dressed , thinking of the slopes , the bat caves set within the slopes , the guano fields spread across the bat caves . He hummed a smudge of breath on each lens of his spectacles , then wiped the glasses on his shirttail before slipping them on . Man more advanced the deeper we dig . This revolutionary thesis was beginning to develop urgency . He 'd seen evidence of it in the field over the past several months  --  elaborately notated bone objects , increased cranial capacity . But the notion itself  --  that at a certain layer of soil the signs of man 's increasing primitivism cease abruptly , to be replaced by a totally converse series of findings  --  this idea had been too radical to take firm hold in his mind until recently , when , in Softly 's presence , he 'd felt the first trifling stir of implication . Wu had assumed the entire series of layers had been disarrangedby haphazard burial practices or some kind of earth spasm in the area of the dig . He realized , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of progression ( however negative ) to be explained away in this fashion . The indications were in the field . Man 's mental development shows signs of surging upward as we digp322past a certain point and continue down . Layer by layer there is evidence of greater complexity . Working in the area of the Sangkan Ho strata , he and his colleagues had traveled farther back in " primatial time " than anyone before them , a fact confirmed by potassium-argon dating . Eventuallythey 'd come upon the partial skull of an adult hominid of small brain capacity and only the most elemental toolmaking skills . Consideringwhat they 'd previously found , the appearance of these remains was not surprising . But several feet deeper , and about half a million years earlier , were decorative tusk fragments . Below these were signs of fire maintenance , signs of complex tool types and weapons , signs of pottery making , signs of elaborate costumes . Below these was clear evidence of a culture versed in seasonal processes and number thinking . There were tools that bore lunar notations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were bone objects engraved with planetary observations . There were limestone slates that carried records of pregnancy and birth . All these patterns had been verified in the laboratory through microscopic analysis , the markings clearly indicative of a culture that perceived the notion of time itself as a nonrandom process that enabled humans to reckon their acts and conduct their lives against a fairly predictable setting of climate , geography and celestial event . Deeper , there were clay huts and drainage systems and below this was a flat stone that could not be clearly analyzed as decorative or notational ; it was marked with a quartz engraving tip as follows : Bats in flight , Wu concluded , pleased that the engraving suggested his avocation . Then it occurred to him that he might be holding the stone upside down . It was at this point that he was lured from the site by Softly 's abrupt summons , later to be informed by colleagues that be/low the stone they 'd found skull fragments , vertebral and pelvic components , hand and foot bones , teeth and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hominid " who not only had a brain capacity equivalentto modern man 's but also ( judging by his noncranial parts ) resembledus in body size , manual dexterity , posture , locomotion and even the way he chewed his food . So it was that Wu speculated as he crossed the path to Billy 's cubicle : what would the remaining levels reveal : bronze , iron , plastic , neoplastic ? He entered striding . " Tell me about mathematics . " " What 's to tell ? " " I understand it 's a crazy way to live . " " What are you doing here anyway ? " " Visiting , " Wu said . " Saying hello . " " I mean here in the antrum . Rob has us here for different reasons for each person . What 's your reason ? " " He has n't told me . " " Why not ? " " I do n't know . " " How will you find out ? " " He told me to ask Mainwaring when Mainwaring gets here . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't or could n't . I do n't mind waiting . I like it here . I go artifacting and study the bats . Hobby of mine for years . " " What do you learn from bats ? " " Bat lore . " " Give an example . " " Depending on the hemisphere , bats fly out of caves in leftwardtendingspirals or rightward-tending spirals . Taking the globe as a whole , we see that bilateral symmetry is preserved . " " Where did you meet Rob ? " " The Chinese-American Science Sodality . A few years ago . " " What was he doing there ? " " Rob has a deep interest in things Chinese . He was born in China . Did you know that ? " " He never told me about an event like that . "  | " In fact his physical condition is a result of something called Chinese gnome disease . This is a crippling illness that was prevalent in a particulararea of China for an entire millennium . It attacks the bones and muscles , preventing normal growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't until recently that the cause was found . A lack of certain minerals in the water . " " He never told me that . " " Maybe because you 're not Chinese , " Wu said . " I 'm Chinese . " " What 's your field ? " " Prehistory . " " How far back ? " " Practically out the other end . " " Are bats known to be dangerous ? " " Just the opposite , " Wu said . " We should do everything we can to see they survive and prosper . This is because their waste material is useful as fertilizer . Maybe you do n't know it but the economies of entire countries are based on the export and domestic use of bird droppings . Skirmishes have already taken place between neighboring countriesdisputing the ownership of coastal islands where millions of sea birds do their shitting . Bats are next . The commercial market for bat guano is already growing . It wo n't be long , people being what they are , before some individual or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back to your question , you do n't want to get bitten by a bat with rabies . If you do n't have the antibodies you 'll get infected , which means you acquire the consciousness of the animal in question and become antagonistic to water . Crazed bat consciousness . I think about it from time to time when I 'm crawling through a bat cave . " Before leaving , Wu reached in his pocket and took out a crumpled letter , saying someone had evidently left it in his cubicle by mistake .

Our need to unify and explain it . Our attempt to peel back experience and reveal the meaning beneath . The task is to attempt a logical design that may or may not duplicate the structure of the thing itself . His desk , unlike the others in the antrum , thrown togetherand wobbly , was an elaborate sectional apparatus with automatic drawers , a pop-up typewriter , modular shelving and a built-in pencil sharpener that operated on batteries . The desk ran parallel to all but one side of the cubicle , where the entrance was located . The cubicle itselfwas considerably larger than the other living units , hardly suited to the word " cubicle " in fact . The bed , adorned with huge silk pillows , had little in common with the cots elsewhere in the area . Sweating excessivelySoftly undid the belts on his leather briefcase , lifted the worn flap and began sifting among bottles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliriants , sedative-hypnotics , local anesthetics and animal tranquilizers . Among the collection a sample-sized bottle made him smile , containing as it did the high-grade synthetic intensifier he 'd given Maurice Wu to chew soon after the latter had first arrived in the antrum . The label included a warning : Insightful experiences may intensify existing psychosis . Far from showing panic reaction , however , Wu had emerged from a period of chills , irregular breathing and slurred speech with a tentative and rather engaging idea about counterevolution . Softly found what he wanted now . He lifted out a vial , twisted off the cap , removed the cotton packing and shook a capsule into his hand . He swallowed it without water and then got into bed , wearing socks , slippers and his robe . He became drowsy almost at once . His perspiration smelled less tense and septic . Another ephemeral chemicalevent , he thought . Opiate receptors functioning nicely . Sense data less demanding . He stuck his thumb in his mouth , thinking suddenly of the peculiar demonic genius of street games , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many games of something fearful transmitted through certain words or the wile of simple touch . He began to vomit calmly . Tag  --  you 're it . What was it but something or someone too evil to be named ? Hoodman blind . Hango seek . Skin the cuddy . He raised his head from vomiting position , eyes closed ( to avoid seeing the ejected matter ) , and then leaned back on one of the pillows and thought of the game he and the boy had more or less jointly invented , halfball , a " meaningless formal game " designed to be played almost anywhere  --  street , pasture , alleyway , an empty green in summer'smurmuring dusk . Elements of rounders , baseball , tag , cricket , one o ' cat , stickball and children 's verse . The task is to work out an abstract scheme which may or may not reflect the composition of the thing itself . Convenient fictions , he thought . Den so-te , he thought . Water flowing along a gutter on a city street . A figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was Mainwaring , a well-barbered man of middle age  --  tall , ruddy , fit and trim , emitting an executive scent . He knew the large puddle beyond the curb was an invitation to cab drivers to veer this way and splatter his clothes but he was n't worried , being certain he could step aside in time and seeing the entire process ( from the driver 's viewpoint ) as an exercise in perceiving functional relations between entities ( puddle , figure , vehicle ) . It was his conviction that taxi drivers are no more than theoreticians of massive insult , delighted by the prospect of splattering or maiming , having no inherent need to think beyond relationships to the literal disfigurement of objects or people . The truly brutal ones were bus drivers .

Every symbol she wrote in her notebook seemed to possess the resolve of a finished work , an isolated operation neatly free of assumption and shaved of the danger of intuitive reckoning . This work was all there was . Her life had been reduced to a process of selection and refinement . This was merciful , she believed , considering the atmosphere of horror that so often prevailed in the world outside . Nothing in her work was accidental . This is the single theme variously affirmed , tested and modified . She realized she had n't seen her own face since taking the ramshackleelevator down . The past , the whole chromium world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negative image of colleagues , family and friends ; of university towns , fellowships and travels ; of visits to suburban Bellevue . It was puzzling , this happiness she felt , an extendedmeasurement of the textures we 're able to achieve beyond the sum total of events that compose our lives . In this hole in the ground Edna knew she lacked nothing , wanted nothing , could easily dismiss all past associations and all prior honors . She lived in the grip of scientific rapture . The complicated longings of the woman who had made her way in the world ( through the force of intellect alone ) were so subordinate now as to be nearly nonexistent . Ambition , love , friendship , the pleasuresof giving and of winning away , the comfort of professional acceptance , the soul 's snug glow at the failure of others  --  all those fitful inclinations , those urgencies and yearnings were so much dead air compared with this simple and total absorption , holism , a state of unqualifiedbeing . Edna Lown was entering herself just as surely as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swallow them to the shoulders ; arms , legs , torso ; a bewitchingly comic meditation technique ; leaving the head balanced on a cushion , head and skull , abode of the layered brain , everything we are and feel and know ; the universe we 've made . The small craft began its vertical descent . Despite the many hours of travel , the plane-changing , the time zones , Mainwaring remained fresh , his hair brushed straight back , faintly gray in places , his jaw seemingly locked into position with cotter pins . Across the aircraft 's fuselage **25;3039;TOOLONG . . . " Actually that 's similar to L. 's favorite scene in contemporary literature , a passage from Ionesco 's The Bald Soprano in which the family conversation goes : " Well , it is nine o'clock .

I well know that he does not find me " presentable " enough  --  on his mother 's terms  --  to ever invite me to the theater where he rehearses his script for life 's tedium . So I take great pleasure in imagining him declaim phrases of equally majestic monotony concerning the cooking of peas , rabbits , hams , camels , rutabagas . I also enjoy wondering whether his family gives him hell , as I do , when he drinks the seventh Scotch in a row , whether they make him wash his hands before he sits down to dinner . Out in the world , it is in part L. 's unkemptness that attracts me : unbarbered hair falling helter-skelter about a yellowcollar , tie perpetually askew , the ruffian air of tobaccostainedteeth .

Since the evening before we have made love six , sevenp101times . It is the first weekend he has spent a whole night with me , having invented an elaborate excuse to his mother about a Saturday pheasant shoot .

" I throw a pebble into the river . What polite lies I tell him . It 's part of my courteous nice-to-Mommy phase , oh boy am I ever congenial , docile , subservient in this incarnation . The truth is that L. has found in me the two things he fears the most : poverty and a capacity for passion . Whereas I have found in him all that I desire the most in this particularly lunatic phase of my life : the glamor of history , the flash of his Paris monde , torture . Ah , yes , he certainly tortures me , he tortures me byp103denying me what I have never wished from any other man : to be totally subservient . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever desired that servile state  --  I would be happy to be his official mistress , his official slave . Something holds him back from offering me the abjection I secretly crave . Not enough love ? The convolutions of his sadism ? His mother 's dominance ? Once , while skating on a winter day ( so begins one of the literary fragments L. sends me in the mail almost weekly ) , a young woman rushed up to me with a lightning stroke of her skates , stopping by me in a voluminous spray of ice . The weight of her gloved hand rested firmly on my shoulder . We skated off together arm in arm , and for the first time I was able to fall in love . The absence of the expected repulsion was in part due to the uncommon hardness of her torso , which gave my fingers the illusion of touching an object of metal or of stone . She reminded me of those statues which seduce me by their halfvirilefemininity . To condense L. 's plot : The narrator and his austere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of their many drives together in the city , the hero , observing Bettina as she reclines in the back of a horse-drawn carriage , notices that her beauty has grown singularly flawed since that first encounter when she had appeared to him on the ice , austere , severe , cloaked in black like a dagger . The southernclimate and the maturing of their relations has made her into a woman . " I asked myself , " the writer ponders , " what funerary fate was next due her : sickness , maternity , death ? " Bettina falls ill with malaria . Her lover is so repelled by this further corruption of her flesh that he abandons her to die alone . " And yet , " he meditates shortly before dying himself , " if Bettina had remained the marvelous statue she had been when I met her , would I not have defended her unto death , would I not have defended her until the extreme limits of my strength ? " Perhaps I am in small part that boy-girl L. describes  --  bony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe that 's why he tolerates me so much better than most women ( or so he says ) ; why he has abstained from his lesbians and his whores for a while . From early on I know that we can not last together for very long . For L. is fearful of our enacting any event more than once , as if any repetition would spoil the fragile felicity we had known the first time , as if every parcel of experience were as corruptible as the heroine of that morbid tale . Our brief life together is like one of those summers of early childhood furnished with didactically single archetypes : the rose garden , the grandmother , the well , the dark forest beyond the house . So with us : the one weekend spent at my flat , the one night at a country hotel , the one luncheon with L. 's adored spinster sister . Seducers are fetichists , obsessed with preserving the magic emanation of objects and events , searching for untapped sources of ecstasy . Yet L. is not incapable of extreme sentimentality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that valentine of a gift he brings the first week we know each other : a tiny alabasterheart hung on a gold bracelet chain . " I can do things nicely , with old-fashioned style , " his eyes mock me as he presentsit in a velvet box . " Let us have a name for making love , " he says another time , as we stand by a florist 's window . " You know , like in Proust . " " You mean when Swann and Odette called it catleyas ' ? " " Yes , that 's it . " He smiles , the crinkles gathering fiercely about his eyes . " I adore your literary side , you little left-wing intellectual , as much as I abhor your politics . We can call it columbine . " When L. is not being literary , which he relishes , he talks mostly about the grandiose " style " of those French aristocrats whose wealth he envies . The plague of his life is not to have enough money to honor his name " with a style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we sit at the Fiore , on river banks , in public parks , on museum benches , in between long exegeses of Andre Breton and Rene Char , he talks about the Rochefoucaulds ' castle , the Mouchys ' fox hunts , the Montesquious ' extraordinary chef , the Caraman-Chimays ' sublime collection of Charles IX furniture . At times he talks out his envy with rage , after much drink he whines it out like a child , once he takes me to the country to see a ruined structure that had been his family 's castle , he leans his big head against a heap of rubble as against the bars of a crib , sobbing his heart out . " The pigs , the pigs , they destroyed it all . . . . Well , soon I shall marry into money , and have it rebuilt . " All of this with genuine pathos . He wants even more of that world of the high aristocracy . It is a universe I crave to enter but have too much pride to beg entrance into ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two nights a week he is not with me or with his mother , snubbed by many for his relatively modest means and the recentness of his title ( which Paris wits say is the source of his drinking ) . What I envied that world 's inhabitants most were not their houses or their horses or their money but the serenity and repose of their historic stature . I admired what I thought to be their Olympian tranquillity , a lack of that striving , clawing , charming , showing off which marked my mother 's family and most all society I had known . How sublime to possess their prerogative for that brusqueness , rudeness , arrogancewhich were a repressed part of my own character , how sublime not to need charm ! In Paris the gaze of these personagesoften reposes haughtily upon me  --  the women 's malicious , the men 's inviting and lascivious  --  at the kind of parties at which I met L. Now here 's the subtlest torture L. tries to effect upon me : he does not want me to enter that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my independent incursions into it . He occasionally invites me to accompany him to the Mouchys ' , the Rochefoucaulds ' , etc. , and then calls it off at the last minute . I am a trifle too independent , too much of an actress , top106satisfy his whims of torture . He is annoyed when I feign casual indifference about an evening 's cancellation . Our relationship is made imperfect by my incapacity to satisfy his profound sadism . Of course ! That 's why he keeps returning . And then the sister ! When L. is not talking about literature or " the top one hundred , " as he calls le monde , he talks about Princess Amelie . He is mesmerized by her . She seems to spend most of her time aggrandizing her collection of cut-crystal boxes , ordering his meals , finding special little bargains for him : a Dior tie on sale at the Printemps in some bargain basement , first-rate English shirts reduced by half at some boutique off the Place Vendome , a marble-topped night table with Sphinx legs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me at the office to say little else but " Amelie has finally fired that terrible old cook of ours and found someone much better for only fifty francs more a month ! " Or " Amelie has cut her hair , it 's in a lovely gamine effect this week . " I visualize Amelie as slender , dryly elegant , imbued with that studied gaiety with which wellborn spinsters often hide the suffering brought them by a tyrannical mother . Sayings of L. 's , aphorisms scribbled on scraps of paper ( no doubt a welcome solace in that dreary office of his , where he worries about the last shipment of refrigerators to Lyons , losses on the breakage of light bulbs in Grenoble , how many defective toasters remain in Marseilles , etc . ) : Only mistrust those you love . Only they have the strength to hurt you . By all means avoid all contact . It is certain that those who love us are the ones who harm us the most . They flatter us away from eternity . They exercise the worst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandeur of our solitude . Love is a chain of cowardly complaisances and of perfidious attacks upon our privacy . Simultaneous scribblings in that journal of mine which awaitsp107the awakening of Stephanie the writer . This entry in the form of a self-questionnaire : " Are you sensuous ? " " You bet . " " Are you physical ? " " Alas no , hopelessly cerebral . " " What do you want in life ? " " Ecstasy and tenderness . And to be heard , eventually . " " What do you fear the most ? " " Insomnia , still . Waking up alone in the dark without my daddy , my bottle . " " What is love about ? " " About talking . " The fin-de-siecle furniture of our gilded , brocaded hotel room emanates a savor of clandestine love . Champagne is alreadywaiting in the room . L. has brought me to one of those classical country inns where , for two generations , men whose style he covets have held their weekend bacchanals . There is a bouquet of columbines on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's a hopeless sentimentalist , that 's the last thing he would ever admit about himself . " You must admit , my dear Stephanie , that I am style incarnate , " he cackles as he opens the window into the spring night . Toward dawn he becomes suddenly thoughtful , childlike . " It 's admirable , " he says . " I have friends married for twelve years who came here last month and made love a half-dozen times in one night , as we have . Could anything be stranger ? " We discuss it for several hours , we talk about how terrified we are of that morbid descent from bliss which any permanence entails . But once he has dabbled in his favorite bit of metaphysics ( need for continual ecstasy ! continual terror of its degeneration ! ) L. ascends his stage again and struts about in that silk bathrobe his sister has just found for him on sale at Dior , declaiming his other insatiableneeds. 7 A.M. : " I must live in a certain style without which I perish . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am style incarnate . You must admit I do everything with style . " 8 A.M. : " Why be loved , when it 's so much easier to be hated ? " 9 A.M. : " Why do n't you wear real jewelry ? God , those drearyp108politics of yours . There is something fabulously seductive about the clang of real pearls upon the night table , good for an immediateerection. " i o A.M. : " And of course to live in style I have to marry an heiress . Do n't worry , I 've already found her . It 's been arranged for many years , we 're just waiting for her to grow up . " i i A.M. , after more champagne : " Why do n't you desire things ? " he howls . " Jewelry , fur coats ? So many men must be offering them to you constantly ! You always refuse ! You 're constantly refusing the only things we could give you a bit of ! No , mademoiselle wants my tenderness . " In between , great fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how incapable of fidelity , how profoundly conservative , how materialistic , how corrupt . God , how marvelouslythe French can talk . I lie in bed smoking , adoring the sheer volume of his verbiage . My father teaching me the theme song of the French girl scouts : " Ne pleure pas , Jeannette , o ; z te mariera , on te mariera , / Avec le fils d'un prince , **30;3066;TOOLONG ... " A brief notation in the mail from L. the following week : My definition of the fall from grace : It was to lose our ability to forever retain the first passionate flush of love . Only its permanence would have enabled life to retain a perfect continuityof the impossible and the possible . Birth trauma ? The human condition ? Always that obsession with the loss of love . Orgasms , orgasms , I never know what to make of them . I can come several times in a row with a man who loves me and when it 's over turn away from him with amicable boredom . I can fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes and desire to spend the rest of my life with him . What is it all about , the howling and screaming with pleasure ? I like the way L. never asks such questions as did you come sweetie , what wasp109it like for you , why did n't you come , he does n't seem to care . The inexplicability , the cerebrality of it all . With L. I celebratethe cerebrality of love , with him I know that we are pure consciousness and little else . Up to now he has been exhilarated by the barely obscene , the classically renegade : orgies with groups of middle-aged lesbian duchesses , visits to Oriental prostituteswhose mouths he considers exquisitely skilled . He likes to tell the story of the Japanese whore who deftly channeled his sperm into a tiny box and wrapped it before him in ravishinglypretty papers , to preserve it as a souvenir on her chest of drawers . He is not able to go much further than that with deviation . He keeps reciting voluminous passages from Sade , Verlaine , Baudelaire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who are truly depraved , since he is unable to shed centuries of family precepts ? Lacking that passion for human liberty which led his heroes to seek prurience , he is a Sade rate , a real failure as a pervert . His playing at evil is but another role to hide his monumental fear of freedom ; of choosinghimself ; of shedding the carapace of prejudices history has encrusted him with . Actually L. makes love with conservative docility , not extraordinarily well , his frequent drunkenness is not conducive to the heavens of invention . He is too lazy to adopt the intricate Kama Sutra business I 've learned with Americans . Frenchmen on the whole are lousy lovers . L. comes by himself , fairly swiftly , missionary style , like a whirlwind , and afterward he often weeps . Yet I know little more about ecstasy than to have been at the center of his storm . He always goes home at about 3 A.M. , so that he can be in bed when his mother sends the maid up with breakfast . How happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canasta table , " You 'll never guess whom Stephanie 's living with ! " It could be the Grand Prix or the Prix Goncourt , as long as it shines she 's happy . I 'm still not sure how much it affects me , the prince business , outside of my need to impress her . Beyond the beauty of his body and of his eyes , the volume ofp110his words , he has also the unreachability , the fundamental glacialness of the classical seducer . When he is very drunk , L. tends to weep again , or else to talk about death . " The most rational human act in the world is to shoot into a crowd at random  --  Surrealist Manifesto , 1922 . " Hands on hips , he lurches down the street outside Jimmy 's nightclub , shouting , " Bang , bang , at random , into a crowd ! " He plays at death , at poetry , the way six-year-olds play cowboy . Another time , as I am at the wheel of his car : " I shall put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press on the gas , place my hands over your eyes , as we go to encounter those utterly splendid trees we shall be in the same state of blindness as is achieved by a kiss that has no end . " A game to which I do not accede , obviously . Listen , dear , I say , I often think about that , too , but when I 'm ready for it I 'll do it my own way , in the river . Every morning in Paris I go to an office where I help to publishone of those trilingual magazines found in the offices of sinus specialists throughout the Western world . It is a dusty room in a seedy building near the slums of the Bastille . I translatearticles from French into English about the coming-out parties of Princess Margharete de Holschwig-Holstein , the raising of lambs in Sardinia , the jewelry of the Maharani of Jaupurmutal , the building of new resorts off the coast of Madagascar . My editor , B.G. , is a puffy-eyed , elegant Englishman whom I often see drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He detests the French more than any other people and has lived in Paris for more than thirty years . I constantly hear him dictating cables to England  --  letter for letter , as one must for Paris operators  --  maliciously using the first letters of French historical disasters : " W pour Waterloo . . . O pour Ontario ... U pour Utrecht . . . L pour Laval . . . D pour Dien Bien Phu ... V pour Vichy .... " Every three weeksp111he remembers there are galleys to be corrected at the printer 's . He grabs my arm and we rush to the suburbs to rescue an issue from a month 's delay . " Be an angel and drive like the devil , " he yells at the cab driver . On the way back we go out for a drink and swap hostile stories about my Parisian compatriots . My best woman friend in Paris , I tell him , is a Sorbonne student whose father is a high government official . Over the last year I have introduced her to her first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to her husband-to-be , and all along have frequently fed and lodged her in my frugal oneroomflats when she was too lazy to go home . I have never been invited for so much as a meal to her large family apartment , in which she lives with several servants . Listen , love , B.G. says , the profile is good enough to be fed into a computer , you 've just described the quintessential inhabitant of this city . Ah , well , you probably did not flatter her enough . Have you noticed that the French find everything boring except the sound of their own voices or that of others ' praising them ? If we stopped flattering them , Parisian ears would go the way of tonsilsand appendixes . Have you ever encountered a people more rapacious , greedy , inhospitable , more stuck on their families , more obsessed with style ? Oh , yes , I say , they sure are obsessed with style . The reason I have lived here for thirty years , B.G. says , is that I hate them so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . Apart from our enjoyable conversations , the tedium of the office work is relieved only by B.G. 's occasional attempts at suicide . Once he ties a noose around his neck and jumps from three telephone books stacked on the floor of his apartment , ending up with a severe sore throat . Another time , noosed again , he stands on a foot-high block of ice and waits for it to melt while reading from the Koran , whose violence he enjoys . My work is lonely . The paycheck is thin . This city seems to hate me . Its damp winds and smogs are giving me chronic bronchitis , its men trying to make me in taxicabs , its womenp112hissing gossip that I 'm a lesbian , the food of its lousy bistros giving me diarrhea , its pipes bursting wherever I live . For those who are not rich , for those who are not made of steel , this most splendid of cities can be as lethal as that statue of Don Juan which drags one into the earth 's glacial bowels . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the wire service : reek of tobacco and Scotch hovering over the din of typewriters . News of McCarthy hearings drumming on the teletypes . Heat of pavements under my naked feet as I walk barefoot to Times Square in my last , rebellious incarnation . The kindness , the cheer , the warmth of my adopted Americans ! B.G. says I remindhim of a boxer who wants to prizefight after having practicedfor twelve hours instead of the necessary twelve hundred . " If you want to survive in Paris , love , you 've got to learn how to box . " He says I am here , of course , to " find myself . " In an American strip-tease joint down the street from the Dior Boutique , my mother 's sobs were muffled by the clanging of a rhumba band . " Life is too short , " she wept , in Russian , " perhaps life is too short to ever be separated at all . " I was beginningmy first winter alone in France . Mama had gathered her pals together to mourn her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in Paris . " But at least , " she continued , " at least I shall leave you in the care of such good friends . " The next day we were accompanied to the railroad station by the clamorous band that followed her wherever she went in Paris  --  directors of glittering shoe boutiques , dress designers , glove and bag designers , window designers , jewelry designers , unsuccessful song writers supported by aging LatinAmericanheiresses . They all vociferated their adoration of Mama , reiterated their pleas that they would watch over me as if I were their only child , that they would each become my best friend in Paris . Laughing , shouting , smoking , hugging , kissing their affection , they took hold of me by the sleeve , by the elbow , pushed and shoved me out of Mama 's sight . Herp113head out the window , she still shouted endearments at me in her native Russian . Indeed , her friends did try to alleviate my chosen loneliness , they were on the phone every two days . B. was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spent my first alcoholic weekend . M. was a former fashion model a few years older than I ( " She will take special care of you " ) who nearly managed to give me my first lesbian experience on a particularly lousy Sunday afternoon . Countess V.T. , the wife of a metal-rich German noble ( " She 'll be a great pal " ) , invited me to lunch the very next week . At her Sevres-laden table five women compared the taste of sperm . Like pea soup , one said . No , more like fish chowder , another commented . A must for the complexion once a week , a third insisted . " Dear Mama , " I wrote to New York to cheer her up , " Your friends are divine . They are taking such marvelous care of me . " Madame Bourdel 's marble-white face was dominated by heavy-lidded , glacially pale blue eyes . Her Empire apartment overlooked the river . She lived off the revenues of her dead husband 's seldom performed plays and her own ventures into literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent out the room of the defunct playwright at the back of her apartment . It was a small , fecally dark chamber , mahogany- and pomegranate-hued , hung with photos of the dead one receiving the Legion of Honor , being knighted by the Queen of Sweden , being made a member of the French Academy . " It is sad but elegant , " my mother commented as she urged me to take the lodging . " The address is impeccable , you will meet the right people here . " In the dim brown corridor that led to my room hung nineteen-thirties photographs of Madame B. 's literary coterie  --  Cocteau , Berard  --  indulging in opiate revelry . Every few days , a thin plume of pungent smoke was profiled against the exotic navy-blue walls of her bedroom . When she was not traveling with her maid to the homes of titled friends in warm climates ( " What is a rest but a change of fatigue ! " ) Madamep114B. held a salon the first Thursday of each month . Actors , fading courtesans , desiccated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aristocracy whose first names sounded like Zouzou , Baba , Nene , Lolo . A famous mistress of nineteenthirtiesvintage gave me motherly advice about who 's who in Paris . " Third diamond bracelet from the mantelpiece , look carefully . An interesting study in good manners . A Portuguese millionaire once offered her ten thousand dollars a month to live with him for precisely ten years , and she stayed to the day , do you understand , to the day ! That is what I call correct , that is style . Almost next to her , two emeralds down : a man you might enjoy if you like the kind who beats you in the dark , but if I were you I 'd start with simpler types unless you absolutelymust have his horses . By the way , never , never , never stay home at night . Make yourself perpetually seen . You 're too ladylike , too proud ! " Three months at Madame B. 's . How she regretted when I left ! " You were so calm , so courteous . " Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish store and a cheap bordello , three months in a seedy hotel off the Quai Voltaire , ten weeks in another on the Rue Bonaparte . I turn and twist in this city like a patient with skin sores shifting in a hospital bed . Skinny , gay , ravishingly affable in my borrowed gowns , I go out almost every night to be wined and dined by lecherous bankers , window designers , publishing tycoons , cold-cereal kings , international hostesses . Every few months I stand on a street corner at dawn to hail a cab , my dress rolled into a pocket of my coat , not having waited for the sentiments , the how-was-its , the when-do-I-see-you agains . That 's the way it was in Cambridge and New York , that 's the way it continues to be here , until I meet L. : unease with the flesh , horror of sentiment , dread of permanence . Sitting alone in a cab at dawn , riding to whatever dreary room I am living in , a phrase from The Story of 0 constantly runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanse of the plastic cab seats under her naked thighs . "  |p115Why  is it hard , perhaps impossible , for women to describe lovemaking with some grace ? It is one of our nights together in Paris , L. and I have drunk until early in the morning , arguing about how evil , how corrupt , how materialistic he is . " Mon pauvre enfant , " I say , " you are such a teddy bear , you are really an adorable , sentimental , home-loving , terribly puritanical boy . " He gets so angry . Oh , how I laugh . Scotch after Scotch at Jimmy 's , four drinks for him for every one of mine , in betweensetups we make a sight of ourselves on the dance floor . He likes to show off that way at times , he has to keep his reputation as a womanizer rigorously maintained , he holds his blond alley cat to him so tight that even Countess V.T. phones me the next morning to give me a talking-to on manners .

" He likes to sit on a straight-backed chair , holding me on top of him , guiding my naked hips with his hands , biting and sucking at my nipples as I glide up and down on him . Then I thrust down upon him the other way , my back turned to him , his hands guiding my hips even faster . Down on the floor , the rough carpet chafes at my chest , his rough tweeds chafe my back as he comes in me with great fury , moaning , moaning . Later he has undressed and is sitting on the edge of the bed , I sit at his feet gently sucking him as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always the great surprise of that cataract . Impossible to know when it is coming , a thrill that , the thrill of the unexpected . Simple things really , much tenderness . The isolation , the solitude of sex . The only place we are totally together , totally ourselves , more solitary than ever . One day L. decides that he wants me to meet his sister . We are to lunch at a small restaurant she likes behind the Opera , onp116a commercial street in which she hunts for many of her bargains . Imagine my surprise : Princess Amelie is not the finebonedspinster I had imagined , but a small dumpy woman whose very haughty , mirthful face is a rotund caricature of her brother 's . Her hair is carefully arranged into a vulgarly teased and curly mop . Much of the time a condescending , fearful smile guards her privacy , causing a network of crinkly lines  --  as in her brother 's face  --  to surround her shrewd green eyes . Throughout lunch the two talk about furniture , upholstery , cousins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that this week . Maman is critical of how Amelie plans to open the summer house in Cannes this June , what shall we do about the fact that Maman does not like the new cook Amelie has hired , also Maman is unnerved that the fee for repainting the entrance hall has risen so high this year . There is total serenity on L. 's face when he converses with his sister . " What are you having for lunch , my dear ? " " The blanquette de veau with onions sounds very fine . " " I thought you did not like veal in sauces ! " " Whatever gave you the curious notion I did not like veal in sauces ? " " Well , that 's the impression I 've had for thirty years , that you did not like veal in sauces .

" I gather that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business appointments , to outline plans of defense against their terrifying mother . Since the mother , quintessence of purity , and the mistress , symbol of defilement , still can not meet in L. 's world , I have to compose her portrait . I imagine her as stout and purple-lipped , with small greedy eyes and messily rumpled black stockings , a woman totally preoccupied with oppressing her servant , recounting her linen and her silver , poking about the lives of her married daughters , visiting widows her age , writing dour family news to cousins , going to Mass . A scowling woman who holds sway over her children not through the force of pity or of the wealth she couldp117prive them of by changing her last will and testament , but through the sheer mythological power of that abject trinity that is still the buttress of many ' Western societies : the family , the fatherland , the Church . My closest relative in Paris is my mother 's sister , who is married to a duke . In fact he 's not really a duke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish duchess . When that Spanishduchess died she left him her title through some matrilineal prerogative peculiar to her family , the way one would bequeath , in a will , a jewel or a dog . As for my Aunt Olga , when she was trying to be a coloratura soprano in the nineteen-thirties she was married to a hotel keeper who owned an establishment near the Opera called L'Hotel des Trois Mondes . Olga and my mother had arrived in Paris from Russia in the late nineteentwenties , two great beauties dressed in rags , vociferating their desires to meet nobility and wear splendid Paris clothes . Baboushka , my great-grandmother , who had come to France a decade earlier , had met the two girls at the train station . And her summing-up of their arrival became a family classic : " All that Communist garbage fills their minds , but they also want to be countesses . " Olga and my mother had hated each other since childhood . It is rumored that they had each tried to set fire to the other 's crib . Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My mother partly realized her ambitions for nobility by marrying my father , a moneyless viscount , whereas Olga had acquired a Frenchman without a du or a de in his name who ran a hotel with the name of a bordello , down the block from an opera house which refused to hear her try out Labile . In most White Russian communities , what with its men 's extraordinary lack of ambition , their indolenttendency to gambling or to drink ( my grandfather was a case in point ) , most social mobility was thrust upon the women . It was their function to climb the icy ladders of Paris  --  that particularly hieratic city -- by becoming noblewomen ,  |p118actresses  or courtesans . So , with the quixotic dukedom Olga acquired in her fifties , she finally enjoyed her revenge upon her sister , and her long-awaited arrival to the Elysian Fields of Parisian success . " What , you 're not married yet ? " she comments jadedly when I go to see her every few months . " And you 're not even attached to anyone interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading ? " She clucks her tongue disapprovingly . She usually receives me lying in her tufted white satin bed , her big round baby cheeks gleaming with cream or frozen in clay masks in preparation for her evening 's outing . Her face , her breasts , her hips , her ears , her nose have been lifted and resurrected by so much surgery that there is little left for me to recognize as the warbling , Meissen-pretty aunt of my childhood . Let us say that occasionally , when I study her very carefully , there is a greedy gleam in her little eyes which reminds me of that personage of twenty years ago . At the age of fiftytwoshe is a surreally youthful pickle of a person , monstrously embalmed by her lotions , her gymnastics , her diets and her bouts of drugged sleep , like some preserved creature that stares out of a brine-filled bottle . She inevitably commences our visits by bitching about the past , and then we go on to discuss irresistiblemen : the Ali Khan and , in particular , Porfirio Rubirosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millionaires are the ones who best mirror her own graspingness , the heiress hunters who milk women for every cent they have . " What a rate , " she exclaims on the subject of B.L. , a noted Paris buck . " You call that a career ? No woman has left him anything , no woman has left him as much as a single piece of jewelry ! What did he get from that last millionairess ? Sandwiches ! Nothing but sandwiches ! " she cackles . I can stare at Olga for hours with a kind of perverse curiosity . For in her vulgar aspirations I glimpse the germs of my life 's most insane phases  --  such as the one I 'm living through now . It is as if in this tough woman totally different from me , fromp119my ambitious but infinitely tender mother , from that callous scheming mother of theirs whom I shall never meet , some common germ could be discovered which would explain all four of us , like the curlicues of a virus diagnosed in a bottled culture . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way we stare at ourselves in the grotesque distorting mirrors of country circus shows . And Olga in turn half welcomes my visits , with the meddling curiosity of the child-hating , barren woman whose only niece has totally flunked decades of family precepts . " Nothing but sandwiches ! " she repeats with a raucous laugh . " You call that success ? I bet that 's all you 're getting , by the way , nothing but sandwiches ! " When she laughs her jowls shake like two bowls of gelatine , her tiny porcine eyes are almost obliterated by the assault of her round glistening flesh . Staring at her as she lies in her sea of cosmetics , I am awed by the generation of women it took to shape her ambitions . I am obsessed with the monstrous battlefields behind us littered with china , crystal , silver , calling cards and other sinister baubles documenting these women 's attempted upward climb . Shall I become one of these monsters ? How to break the vicious expectations of the female tribe ? How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : " The Duchess of so and so will receive from five to seven , blah , blah ? " And staring at Olga I realize that I have come to Paris to relive the ambitions she and my mother held toward this city three decades ago ; that their aspirations lie still implanted in me like some organ grown obsolete in evolution yet large enough to infect and kill me ; that this city may yet destroy me because of the lingering presence of these infected tonsils . In Olga the tonsils are still full-fledged and functional , as monumental as her jaws ; she is tough , she is a boxer , she has survived . " Now , if you want another man of success , a true aristocrat , " Olga continues , " look at my husband , Eugene . An aristocrat of the heart , " she adds briskly . " Is n't that true , my darling ? " Shep120turns toward the fulfillment of her entire life 's ambitions , the duke . lle is a frail , doddering septuagenarian who spends most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to wake up from her drugged sleeps , and inevitably begins his clauses by mumbling the last words of her last sentence . " Of the heart , of the heart , of the heart , the heart , the heart , of course , my angel , of the heart , " he mutters , nodding over his Paris Soir . " And is n't it true that I am tenderness itself , I who was so wronged by my first husband , tenderness itself ? " " Itself , itself itself itself itself , tenderness itself , you are tenderness itself . " They are known to be particularly stingy . Whenever I phone Olga she spends ten minutes pretending to be annoyed at my months of silence , then one time out of two invites me to lunch . " It 's so agreeable , agreeable to see you , " the tiny duke muttersas he shuffles into the living room in his carpet slippers , his hand flashing an enormous sapphire inherited from his last wife . " Agreeable , agreeable . " " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offeringher gleaming oiled cheek , " the season is more hectic than ever , that is why I am left voiceless , I have lost my voice talkingpolitics with ministers of state , I can not tell you how many diplomats I have entertained in this room this week . " At the lunch table a few unpeeled radishes are served as first course , followed by a small piece of burned gray beef reminiscent of those dusty pieces of hide seen in provincial churches that are claimed to be a part of Saint Matthew 's sandal , a handle of the true cradle . " I have my receptions all figured out for the rest of my life , " Olga says . " I have them carefully formulated . We are always thirty at the table , never less , never more , that is precisely how many gold plate settings I have . Tonight , for instance , we are having the Nicaraguan ambassador to Luxembourg , the former Argentine Minister of Health , the Portuguese Minister of Public Works . " She notices that the Christmasp121present she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusting jeweled compact inherited from the last duchess 's estate that has never even opened properly . She starts fiddling at it with a table knife . The absent , gentle duke suddenly becomes a lion , the Frenchman'sindomitable sense of property inflames him to action . He waves his arms like a windmill , the glory of pure matter moves him to start a sentence by himself . " Careful with my fruit knife , " he hollers at my aunt the duchess . " Do n't you dare to ever do that again with my knife my knife my knife ! " More in the mail from L. this week . A new style of writing , mysterious , aphoristic , more lyrical . As usual the theme is the simultaneous absoluteness and impossibility of love , etc . I never know whether the words are his own or someone else 's . " We shall never be rid of our wishes for a golden age . RecentlyI dreamt that I was being transported , within the limits of a park , to that heart of the world where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Orpheus passed through here , leading the tiger and the gazelle side by side . Drawn curtains . . . caressing eyes of felines punctuating the sky with lights . . . the delirium of absolute presence . How could one not continue to love perpetually , at the heart of nature reconciled ? Love , carnal love , only love there is , I have never ceased to adore your evil shade , a day will come when man will recognize you for its only master . " " Well , now , Melanie , " L. says , " what a surprise to see you ! How do you like this beautiful day ! Why are n't you riding your horsie this afternoon ? Is he happy in his stable ? " We have been walking in the Park Monceau . Suddenly a child some twelve years of age has come along the bend of an alley , twirling her shiny new hoop . Her long black hair , heldp122back by a little circlet of gold , falls in gleaming torrents of curls about her shoulders . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornflowers . Her tiny snub nose , her ringlets , the dimples surrounding her prim , tight little mouth , lend her a certain cherubic glory . She wears a starched pink dress with a waist ribbon of a deeper crimson hue . Under the starched ruffles of her bodice , her tiny breasts are like lilac buds swelling under the ice of a March day . Just behind her stands a very formal governess dressed in heavy British tweeds . The child looks at us with surprise and pleasure , a little curiosity . As she stands there holding her hoop under the flowering chestnut tree , I know , I do not need to be told , that this is the unsullied , wealthy being for whom L. is reserving his boredom and the continuation of his name . " Yes , how is your horsie ? " he says . " Why are n't you out riding him on this beautiful day ? " He stares at her dreamily , and beyond her , as if into the park . " Charles is very well , thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisp , barely accented Britannic English , " but Papa says that I must rest him for a week , for last Sunday when we were riding at Saint-Cloud we missed our mark at the last fence , and I went tumbling over his head , and he gave himself a slightly sprained ankle . " L. 's face feigns great horror . " Oh , my poor Melanie , my poor angel ! Are you sure you did not hurt yourself ? " " Oh , do n't worry , Uncle , it was just a very little fall , " she says with a crisp laugh . When she speaks French it 's with a faint British accent , like the Natasha of War and Peace who spoke her own language with a hard , rolled French r . She heaves a sigh , looking longingly at the riding alley , twiddling the ribbons of her hoop . " And how is school ? I hope you are doing well in your courses , " L. continues . " Naughty girl , your papa told me how badly you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are im-proving. "  | " Oh , Uncle , you are always pushing me so hard to work , " she says with a pout and a toss of her curls , whose wealth heaves over the somnolent lake of her face . " Why is it you want me to work so hard ? " " Because I want you to be a very perfect young woman , as I 'm sure your papa does . " " And you and Papa are always conspiring against me , " she says , patting her hair into order . " Latin is so boring . " " But it is essential , my dear , if you wish to develop a clear and lucid style , an elegant way of expressing yourself in letters , for instance . " " But that is all so boring compared to riding , " she exclaims . " Tell me , are you coming up for a weekend to the castle soon ? " She twirls her hoop again . " Papa was just complaining that you had not been up to hunt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come soon , very soon , " he says , his eyes still plunged into the beyond of the park . " Tell your papa I shall be there within the month . " " When you come I 'll show you how well I jump a threefoothurdle ! " And she begins to skip down the alley , her little baton tapping faster and faster at the hoop . " Goodbye , goodbye , " she cries , her pink ribbons flying in the wind , " I 'll see you very soon ! " We continue gravely walking in the park . " We chose her , you know , when she was only seven or eight years old . An angel . And all the money in the world . " I know . Woman as angel , woman as beast , the ancient divisions . Venerable and hallowed mothers , sisters , brides versus the harlot mistresses , who particularly trouble men when they are purer than they . Our enslavers segregate us into zoos , with our full consent . Never let the blame fall on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very slowly . One principle of dazzling clarity dominates the psychology of oppression : the oppressor tends to characterize his victim by those very traits which he is most ashamed of in himself :  |p124hysteria  , dependence , feebleness , irrationality . Growing up in the fifties is already made dreary by men other than L. who exemplify this deceitful tactic of control , who pester me the way women are accused of pestering men , pleading for permanence , respectable households , constancy . Paul , for instance , a lover from my college days at Radcliffe , travels from Boston to my Paris apartment every three months as punctually as some migratory bird . He leans against the door , or a wall of the airport , a tree in the park , wherever we meet , and says , " Someday you 're going to marry me , Steph . . . . I 'm going to faint now . " And in a slow rolling motion he slumps onto the floor , all six feet of him . He comes to within ten minutes or so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours playing the rules of his game , admitting some admiration for his candor  --  how many men accede to their surely frequent desire to faint before women , without suppressing it with outdatedmyths of virility ? But soon afterward our ways part again . For however many books Paul has read , however many degrees he has accumulated at Harvard , he threatens me with that sheltering security which terrifies me more than being a whore , a cocaine peddler , a tramp . With him I can predict what Caribbean island we would frequent at the age of thirty , where we would send our children to school when we were thirty-seven , where we shall go for our divorces at the age of forty-two . I can hear his deep voice whining , " Ca n't you make soup out of all those lovely zucchini wasting away in the garden ? " and " God , darling , when shall we ever get a decent summer bed cover ? " and " I 'm going out to get organic molasses to make some lovely dark bread . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paul belongs to that race of house husbands , of Father Earths , who will be the loneliest victims of the magnificent sexual revolution which is beginning to sweep the Western world . He follows me about with the lowering manner of a mother cow , reminding me to eat on time , ordering me to put my hat and boots on ,  |p125using  those simple tactics of domination which go under the guise of shelter . Otherwise , his decision to respect my privacy is admirable . Once , after our beautiful affair during my last year at Radcliffe , we slept in the same bed for three months without ever touching each other . Finally he had bet again on the American myth of the supremacy of the shared orgasm , and he had lost again . I was infuriated each time by our virtuosity . The cerebrality of the flesh , its need for constant discovery ! Perhaps , as L. says , that is the truest meaning of the Fall . What with Paul 's gigantic silences , his meticulous quest for the better restaurant , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if with an aging marriage . For a year he walks beside me with his architectural degrees , his dogs , his Korean war medals , his tweeds , his loving parents , his quiet country house , tall , tanned , skilled at inducing shared orgasm  --  the American dream . But I already know that I do not like myself , that I need to be reborn , that in order to go on living I must break myself apart in order to put myself together again , and Paul will never let me break apart . When we are together , his knotty , powerful hands are constantlyclenched with that repressed rage which he never dares to put into words , which causes him to faint every few months . " Blackmail , emotional blackmail ! " I mutter to myself after those bouts of candor . " All right , talk , talk , " he says after recovering . And I talk as into a tape recorder , seldom corrected , seldom interrupted  --  that 's why it 's so boring  --  saying that happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal , the goal . . . Jesus , did n't he remember my college thesis on Kierkegaard ? It is the fourth and last time he has come to Paris . I smoke throughout the meal , barely eating . He flashes me that perfecttoothedsmile which shelters him like a mask. " ... he said the goal is a much more tedious task of discovery , self-exploration , shedding of parental values , bringing death to the old self , being reborn  --  oh , God , I forget what else . "  | " Sure you forget , Steph . You 've been through seven cycles of rebirth just in the few years I 've known you . " " Okay , explain this one to me , precisely because it may have to do with forgetting : Everything has been written that needs to be written about physical frigidity , but what about the emotionalkind ? I 'm a case of spiritual nymphomania and emotional frigidity . " " It 's because you 're so goddam literary . " The pegs they find for you , always their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means nothing unless it 's texturedby a fascination for power , for adventure , for suffering , for the impossible . . . " They do n't understand a word of it . Those damn sex manuals have taught this generation of Americans such reverence for women 's orgasms that they are emotional illiterates . Their next step is always a return to the sheltering tone . " I ca n't stand to see you living in that hovel . " " I want to live in a hovel for a while . I want my filth , my solitude . I want my despair , my floundering . " " This city is killing you , Steph . You 've lost ten pounds in the past four months . " " Well , maybe I want to almost die . Maybe it 's my destiny to be almost killed by this godawful city . " It is a cold or a hot night in Paris , I do n't remember , I rememberlittle of these last months save the stupor in which I go out to dull the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangovers , the growing tightness in a stomachthat can barely digest anything , my bouts of rage at my impasse with L. I only remember that in the middle of that last evening with Paul I turn away and stare at an American couple dining by candlelight whose beauty harasses me . The man looks disturbingly like Paul , with that buffed , burnished aura of Ivy League and good tobacco . The woman is about ten years older than I am , with ashen hair pulled back into a soft bun . She smiles , and rests her chin on her slim ringed hand.  |p127There  is a serenity about them which I know I shall have to achieve someday to avoid my own destruction . Oh , save me , God , but not quite yet , as we used to say in the seminar on Saint Augustine . But not quite yet . The next morning , to remain true to his image of me  --  what else can I leave him ?  --  I compose a literary note for Paul . " I have tried so long to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much are n't you cornering me , are n't you protecting me from those encounters with fate which women are so brutally deprived of ? " Colette . How well she understood our ambivalent need for solitude , the blackmail tactics of men who offer oppression in the guise of shelter . " As a vagabond , how many times will I turn toward that strength of yours which is both my repose and my deepest wound ? Perhaps you had not counted on the pridefulness of poverty , and the banality of happiness . " He takes the plane back to New York that day after scribblinghis own little note , in which he appreciates the " sensitivity " of mine . A few months later , just after I 've fallen ill , he writes me from his parents ' home in Massachusetts that he misses me , and that all may be over between us . I alternately weep and rejoice at his letter , fearing and missing his shelter as the canary misses its cage . When I was a child my father  --  in an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a winter camp in the French Alps ironically named " The Sweet Nest . " Every afternoon scores of children were bedded in metal cribs upon an outdoor terrace for their nap , their hands tied behind their backs to deny them the comfort of sucking their thumbs . I used to lie there in the brilliant cold , staring at the detested snow , my ears ringing with the shouts of children deprived of this great solace . My convalescence in Switzerland now reminds me of those afternoons . Terminal despair , the air about me like thep128bars of a crib . Some weeks before I came here a doctor stood at my bedside in a Paris hospital , saying , " You will be saved by altitudes . " Five thousand feet up in the Alps , my windows overlook a Wagnerian landscape constantly washed by monumental sheets of rain . The furniture of my hotel room is finished with a uremic glaze particular to tubercular resorts : the chest of drawers , the chairs , the beds , glisten with a brash yellow veneerapplied between occupancies as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally alone . In this dismal season sandwichedbetween the end of the skiing and the opening of the golf the hotel is almost devoid of guests , the ground lies like mangled flesh between thin bandages of filthy snow . I have been ordered to spend eighteen hours out of each twenty-four in a reclining position , to walk an hour in the morning , an hour in the afternoon . After breakfast I walk as far as my strength allows me upon country roads dotted with sanatoriums . A few hundred yards above me men in striped pajamas stand on balconies , waving and shouting lewd appellations . My days are measured by medicines , my walks are attended by the hooting of owls and the yelling of these pale , striped men . Everything here is minutely portioned out , as in an infant 's diet , doled out in tiny dosages . The little walks , and every two hours the little white pills that will bring my crazy white corpuscle count back to normal , every three hours the pink tonic that will help strengthen the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three or four times in the dark to bring me another bout of sleep . Some mornings I reach for the wrong bottle , take a yellow barb instead of a pink tonic , force myself to vomit it out to deter the terror of another sleepless night . The lunchtime medication is the trickiest bit of the schedule : amberbrown , faintly anised drops  --  most effective when accompanied by a great deal of wine  --  which put me to sleep for two hours of the afternoon . All right , darling , I say at twelve noon sharp , drink yourself to sleep , afternoon is the most painful time ofp129all , like the sound of those children screaming in their cribs . Finally , lunch is finally arriving . Le petit bi f teck , encore du gros rouge , les pommes frites , le cantal du pays . The brown drops toward the end , with a bite of apple and the fifth large glass of red wine to wash them down . I rise from my chair and keep my spine very straight , trying not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to be dignified . There is always a handful of transients to watch me , a few tourists passing by on their way to Zurich to admire the rain pouring down on the Wagnerian landscape . Schon , schon . A pretty , neurotically thin young woman with long blond hair rises from the table and carries a cup of decaf to her room . One foot carefullyahead of the other , there , very slowly , so as not to stumble in public . They must think I am here to recuperate from some disease of the spine , the way I stare straight ahead of me so as not to miss the lowest step of the stairs . Or that I am catatonic , or hypnotized . Stairs after lunch , the most difficult part of the day . The first week I was here I kept stumbling on the seventh step , spilling the brown medicine all over me , laughing my head off , reeking of anise , but it was all worth it , worth two and a half hours of this month 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcoholic : to drink enough to feel good without letting the world know how good you feel , to keep that a secret , a deep inner secret . To be secret . To be alone . That is the alcoholic 's secret , the alcoholic 's loneliness . That 's the whole fun of it , to walk through a room keepingthat secret secret . I fall often upon the shit-colored stairs , but what a deep sleep I have , passing out on the Lysol-scented sheets .. . Upon my waking , the mountains loom about me like the bars of an enormous crib , I feel five , six months old , my mouth is sucking for comfort , I lie in my bed whimpering for my next fix , my next bottle , my next sleep . More dosage upon waking : a cup of strong tea with lemon to startle me into reality again , a slice of raisin cake for the sugar energy that will take me onp130my walk . Outside , a group of Swiss tourists ride brown mares into the rain-gorged golf course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waking up . As I start walking , the terror of insomnia looms again . Every hour I am awake I dread the next night 's solitude , every hour is obsessed by the desire to be returned , with minimumstruggle , into that dark maternal night . I pass the terraced sanatorium where men stand in striped pajamas , calling and waving . That 's what men are , cripples shouting obscenities , never able to give me what I want : both tenderness and ecstasy . Two English spinsters sit beside me in the tea shop where I take my four-thirty pill . God , we are all so pale . " It 's that foul English air of ours did your lungs in , dear , " one says to the other . It 's those foul Paris drawing rooms did me in , sweetheart , that foul middle-class disease passed on by women , to rise , to rise . You bitch of a city , you finally did me in . One afternoon before tea L. suddenly steps out of a taxicab , just like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in the hospital , notes to the effect of " Why did you do this to me , you are torturing me again , " etc . We go to the hotel bar . He sits with his back to the Alps , his chair separated from the abyss by a slim mountain fence . He is drinking something red , a gin and Campari , I think . " Why did you come here ? " he asks . " I detest mountain views . " " Why did you come here ? That 's more interesting . " " I may never see you again ! When will someone drum some sense into you ? . . . " In a few hours the fever returns . I am weak , weakened by wine , weakened by sex . Our first and last illness . Our first and last mountain view . Our first and last trip abroad . He stands by the window , declaiming , " I need a certain way of life . . . style . . . do n't you think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . you must admit that I am style incarnate ... " Style incarnate style incarnate style incarnate yes yes you are style incarnate . Suddenly I rise and run , out of the room , I decide to run away , to run so fast and so far that I shall never be found.  | ... high up on the mountain a feminine figure ran down the path in great haste , but the way was steep , and it constantly seemed as if she hurtled herself down the mountain . She came nearer . Her face was pale , only her eyes blazed terribly , her body was faint , her bosom rose and fell painfully , and yet she ran faster and faster , her disheveled locks streamed loose in the wind , but not even the fresh morning breeze and her own rapid motion was able to redden her pale cheeks . Her nun 's veil was torn and floated behind her , her thin white gown would have betrayed much to a profaner glance , had not the passion in her countenance turned the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where does this woman belong ? In the cloister ? Have these passions their home there ?  --  In the world ? This costume ?  --  Why does she hurry ? Is it to conceal her shame and disgrace , or is it to overtake Don Juan ? She hastens on to the forest , and it closes about her and hides her , and I see her no more , but hear only the sigh of the forest . Poor Elvira ! I run and run and fall under a pine tree , the stars throbbing at my skull like needles of light . I feel as if I have been devouredby maenads , as if my limbs are scattered all about the forest , hundreds of yards apart from each other , and all the flesh left to me is one enormous muscle of a heart that is about to explode . I grasp for breath , ten or twenty seconds elapse before each breath , my mind is as light and clear and giddy as if I were whiffing pure oxygen . Hooray , hip hip hooray ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephie went boom boom . But all Stephie 's horses and all Stephie 's men will help to put Dolly together again . One or two things are brilliantly clear : She wants desperately to live . She is not her mother , or her aunt , or any of the female tribe before her . She is herself . So that 's what we have to do , break out of everything we 've been taught , allow ourselves to scatter apart and try to pick ourselves up again . Like that quote from Kierkegaard which Ip132kept repeating just last year , in that world Fm about to return to for good : " So then choose despair , for despair itself is a choice . And when a man despairs he chooses himself . . . in his eternal validity . " Oh God , there comes that Parisian creep , his face screwed up like that of a big rubber doll .

Suddenly he looks just like his sister , a fat-faced , pathetic baby . " I suppose you 'll soon be going back to New York and those ghastly leftist friends of yours . " My first and last insult .

You should look in on that scene sometime , you 'd have the screaming heebie jeebies in five minutes , you 'd be scared so shitless of those friends of mine you 'd be yelling for your little sister in five minutes flat .

Families are the most intense cannibalistic machines in existence , are n't you hip to that ? They 'll pull you apart limb from limb if you do n't wean yourself away from the nipple before the next Pentecost comes around . . . . " By that time we are back in my hotel room , L. is brushing his teeth , gargling over the sink , his green eyes roll with amazementin his large face . Well , I must say he is doing relatively well , hiding some surprise at that last aria of mine . Masks uponp133masks of style , masks of cynicism , God how they 're skilled at it . " I adore you , " he gargles . " I adore potatoes with lard . Do you like potatoes with lard ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need style , admiration , brutality , perpetual bliss . " According to a mutual friend , L. proclaimed , years later , that he had found me insufferable because he could not communicate with me in words , but that I had offered him the greatest " ecstasy " of his life , whatever that is . I , on the contrary , found the mechanics of our sex indifferent . I was in love with him becauseof the gods I later forswore , because I loved the sheer volume of his words , because he made me feel pure consciousness , because I was fascinated to discover the next turn in the convolutions of his mind . How little people understand of each other . Or of love , which after all is mostly a process of reconnoitering , of exploration , of communication , i.e. , a system of information-gathering . I did not see L. again until years later -- a decade after I went home and married Paul  --  as he strutted on the boardwalk in the south of France in the company of his large family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her years ago , led the regal file like an aged chicken . Bloated , bejeweled , hobbling on a cane , her fat legs wrapped in sagging black stockings , her small greedy eyes swiftly roving left and right to see what suspicious new faces were about . Then followed L. 's sister Amelie , her plump little face more chapped and chilblained than ever , her eyes screwed up into that wince of fear they assumed whenever she thought of her mother , as if she might even be scolded for the logistics of this particular promenade . Behind her , of course , came L. , resplendent in a yellow turtleneck . He was vastly fattened , his cheeks had reddened and turned even coarser , displaying those capillary patches that give away the most indulgent life . His face was scrunchedp134up into that feignedly stupid smile which sheltered him from the ridicule of emotion , his eyes lewdly scanned every woman who passed by , his head seemed larger than ever as it doddered on his overfed body like that of a monstrous Buddha doll . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three , walked the young Princess Melanie , her prim little mouth set into an expression of extreme displeasure , her former beauty almost destroyed by what one assumed were arduous years of childbearing , seeing that she had three young ones in tow that day and was barely twenty-three . Nothing much was left of her beauty , really , save the vacant cornflower-blue eyes that hung upon her drawn face like waning lamps on a dark , still night . What a beautiful and moving greeting L. sent me for my birthday recently , as he does every November . Over the years I have found that his messages grow increasingly classical , sentimental , meditative , unhappy , and I am surer than ever that the words are someone else 's , not his own .

How many days at sea ? Latitude and longitude ? Goodbye , good luck ! " The sailors and the passengers of each boat stare at each other as they retreat , without saying a word . Some are off to search the suns of Asia , others the sun of Europe , which will equally be witness to their death . The passengers signal each other from far away . " Adieu ! Good luck !

But if you can not do this , then collect yourself  --  respect every honest effort , every unassumingendeavor , and above all have a little more reverence for woman .

" Get hold of the fisherman , call off the fishing trip , and let 's go to the beach ! " She lies on the sun-drenched terrace , her magnificent body gleaming with oil , quivering with the excitement of morning planning . " All three generations finally under my roof , " she says to the masseuse . " Can you imagine my happiness ! My daughter , my son-in-law , my adorable grandsons  --  I 've finally gotten them all to the South of France . " I am at the laundry line , picking at dry bathing suits . At every turn of the garden some ancient self of mine sits up suspiciously and sniffs a recollected odor of childhood and of war . " We 're going to the Cote d'Azur ! " my mother said to me in that summer in 1940 when the Kommandant had given us visas to leave occupied France , and I was disappointed to find that the grounds and the rocks were not a bright cerulean blue . " Love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L-O-V-E  --  Lucien , Octave , Victoire , Emile . Cable direct pour les EtatsC'estca  --  Love . ' Lucien , Octave , Victoire , Emile ... . Merci beaucoup . " He hangs up . The phone jangles angrily again . The fishermanis calling back . The fisherman is annoyed . " We 're terribly sorry , " my stepfather 's suave voice says , " You 've already bought all the fish for the picnic ? . . . Of course , we would n't have caught any anyway , there are almost no fish left on this coast . My dear friend , you make us feel even worse . " " Buy his fish ! " my mother shouts . " Buy all his fish ! " " We 'll buy all your fish . . . . Twenty thousand francs ? It 's a pleasure . . . . Not at all , we thank you . . . . We 're here for the month . We 'll talk again soon . " " Next call Zozo , " my mother cries . " Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach ! " " I can tell your liver is tired , " the masseuse is saying . " Oh , but you ca n't hide anything from me . Vous avez le foie tres fatigue aujourd'hui . All the clients from America seem to have a tired liver . " The north wind rises , the doors bang , the wind whistles through the white shell of my parents ' house . My stepfather 's courteous voice explains to Zozo , Nene , Micou that we shall meet them at the beach , at the cafe , at the nightclub . A bulldozermangles the neighboring mountain . Radios shout , cars roar , Vespas whine , brakes screech , sirens moan on the highwaytwo hundred yards below . A gaiety of petunias and geraniums suffuses the narrow garden . My mother loves all that is open and cheerful . She named this house Villa Come-and-Go . It looks out upon a blue , boat-filled Mediterrannean bay . In 1940 there was the same abundance of large zinnias as now , the same smell of eucalyptus and of ripening figs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1940 and played a game : we conjured up horrible combinations of food to assuage our hunger . " Sardines with hot chocolate sauce , " I said , and won.  | " They are superb , magnificent , " my mother says tenderly this morning , watching my two sons play . " They are sublime , " my stepfather agrees . My mother takes the children on her lap and forecasts the delights of the day : " First we go to the beach , and we lunch at the beach , then we have a drink in Saint-Tropez , then we have dinner in a restaurant .... " " Daddy 's still asleep , " Jeff says . " Why is he always asleep ? " " Because he hates the South of France , " Tommy answers . My mother looks hurt . She puts the children down andstarts trimming her geraniums . Whenever she 's sad she trimsher geraniums . The children run into the garden with an explosion of **26;3098;TOOLONG . " Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat I 'll get you , you terrible German ! " Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play war so much , " my stepfather mumbles . " I suppose they hear too much about the war . " " On to the beach ! " my mother cries . " We 're all ready to go to the beach ! " I go into the house to wake my husband . Paul lies on our bed sprawled out like a large child , one knee curled toward his chest . His eyes are swathed in a black silk mask , his ears are filled with wax earplugs , a pillow is folded over his head , a bottle of red sleeping pills glimmers on our night table . Paul is an old-fashioned man . He believes in the Realm of Spirit , Family Life , and Peace and Quiet . We live in New England because big cities are Dirty , Noisy , and Crime-Ridden . The Riviera is Crowded , Noisy , and Crude . He lifts his pillow . A tired blue eye appears . " How was your night ? " he asks . " Just fair . " " I figured out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the highway , with the acoustics of a perfect Greek amphitheater. "  | " It is noisy . " " Stephanie , I detest the Riviera . " " You 're the one who wanted to come . " " We had to . They 've been asking us for years . " " We have n't had a good talk in days . " " Well , when do you expect to talk ? At that packed beach we have to go to every day , at those cafes where you ca n't hear yourself think ? " " Let 's try again today . And get dressed . It 's time to go to the sea . " " How original . I thought we were finally going fishing . " " Mother says it 's a perfect day for the beach . " " What date is it today ? " " July third . " " Three more weeks here . Steph , you know what my grandmotherused to say when we wanted new bathing trunks for the summer ? She 'd say , What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August , September , and the summer 's over . ' " He gets dressed , and wears that polite , frigid smile he preparesevery morning for his vacation with the in-laws . We walk to the driveway . The children agitate with sand pails around the family car . We pack into the Peugeot station wagon . My mother is happy . " This is the only immortality , " she says , " to have you all here under one roof , in a place I adore . " All her eggs in one basket , she adds , all her chickens in one coop . She praises the color of the sky , the temperature of the water , the whiteness of the sand , the invigorating air . The children 's voices rise over her banter like the twittering of sparrows : " How do you say hole ' in Spanish ? " . . . " How do you say the whole wide world ' in French ? " . . . " Are all Germans bad ? " My stepfather is at the wheel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moustache twitches with emotion . His happinessglows in the precarious balance of our morning harmony.  | " It 's so wonderful , so beautiful , to be here all together , " he says . " Hi , big shots , " he calls out to the children . " Darling Stephanie , " he says to me . " Are you happy , my love ? " he asks my mother . " Finally , " she answers . " We must do this every year . " And the look in her eyes conveys her image of a family united , unanimous in all its pleasures and opinions  --  get out the camera , heads together , smiling , click . . . . My husband 's cheek twitches . His white teeth shine like a keyboard in his tanned and tired face . We drive along the bay toward Saint-Tropez . Here where the new camping site begins , my friend Minou and I used to turn inland on our bicycles at dusk , that winter of the war , to fetch milk from a farm . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy my independence . The pine copse rushes past with a sweep of bittersweet recollections . Across the road , several hundred campers ' tents stretch down to the sea . Billboardsloom over the pine copse , advertising Coppertone , Nivea , Ambre Solaire . Gigantic billboard girls bare their teeth , thrusting brown breasts and bottles of brown liquid at the driver . Campers swarm among the orange tents . " Goodness , " Paul says . " How they spoil the landscape . " " You are a snob , " my mother says . " Statistics show that the height of the average Frenchman has increased by two and a half centimeters since camping has offered them more sun . " " Well , their growth hurts the eye . " " Please be more democratic , " she commands . Convertibles speed past us , filled with young , sadistic , grimacingfaces . The girls ' manes fly in the breeze . A violetcoloredSimca shaves by and closes in in front of us , its driver shouting at the driver ahead of him . My stepfather slams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God , they drive badly , " Paul says . " The French have got to be the most godawful drivers . " " Well , no worse than Americans , " my stepfather says.  | " Nonsense . Americans may be slower , but they 're more responsible . " " Driving is based on fast reactions . All good drivers are fast drivers . " " Statistics show that one out of every four French drivers is hospitalized for a car accident , " I say . " Statistics show that they are terrible drivers . " " It 's that lust for power , " my husband says . " They 've lost their colonies ; they take it out on the roads . " " You 're all so psychiatric , " my stepfather snaps . " They 're young , they 're on vacation , they 're having fun . " We are on a dirt road now , following a line of Opels , Renaults , and Mustangs to Pampelonne Beach . My mother continuesher praises of Saint-Tropez . She has read in Match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day than any other European resort . She has read in Elie that children brought to the Mediterranean suffer twenty percent fewer colds than children taken to the Atlantic . We reach the parking lot . Some three hundred closely packed cars gleam in the sun . My mother inhales the salt breeze ecstatically as we get out of the car . We walk toward the sea , and she stands on top of the dune , looking affectionately upon a seething mass of bodies on the sand . " How amusing this is ! " she cries . " How I love this beach . Come quickly , children ! " We change on the beach , demurely swathed in large towels . Paris friends greet my parents . Beachboys and bartenders swarm around them effusively . The children run to the sea edge . My husband and I shuffle toward our umbrella . He collapseson his mattress and buries himself in the Paris Herald Tribune . I hide in the hot shade and survey the scene . We are daily taken to an establishment called Tahiti-Plage . Its bathhousesare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The name of the restaurant where we eat lunch , the Madagascar Bar , is printed in fuchsia letters on a lemon-yellow awning . The sand is sugary white , orange and turquoise um/brellas thickly pack the beach , we lie on candy-striped mattresses . My allergic skin is a mottled pink , Paul 's peach-hued in the orange shade of our umbrella . Above our heads waiters parade with trays , wearing tight peppermint-striped trunks . At our left a middle-aged woman , her flesh bursting out of a tiny bathing suit , slowly massages her stomach . Girls in doll-sized , fruit-colored bikinis rub amber-colored grease on the backs of their companions . Hand in hand or half entwined , lovers of all ages sprawl in the sun . I discern French and Swedish models , German steel magnates , British starlets , Paris fashion designers , Italian film directors , American decorators . Long-haired teenagers , thighs rotating , breasts bared , parade slowly at the edge of the water , scanning the beach for encounters . And the expanse of oiled flesh gleams in the sun with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clatter of voices and provocative giggling , the roar of motorboats and helicopters . An African rhythm starts pounding from the restaurant jukebox . A woman 's voice screaming , " You 're going to get it ! " is followed by a long , sustained child 's howl . An Arab in burnoose stands over me , wailing the praise of his roasted almonds . I try to talk to Paul . " What is it exactly you do n't like about this place ? I mean how would you define it ? " " The fecklessness of it all . Everybody on the make . " His pale puritan eyes critically survey the surrounding flesh . " All those bodies lying in the sun , like in some ghastly rotisserie . " " Fecklessness ' is the perfect word . You always find the perfectword . " Our children are whooping by the sea edge , throwing pailfulsof water into the moat of a sand castle . He takes my hand . We admire the beauty of our offspring . " The monsters , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , it does n't have to be a trap . Perhaps we should make more of an effort . Perhaps we 're being pills . . . . I ca n't stand hurting anybody 's feelings . "  | " O.K. , I 'm a pill . " He strokes my arm . " Stephanie darling . I 'm sorry , this place tires me so I barely have the energy to talk to you . " " Well , you never talk that much anyhow , sweetheart . " We hold hands . We apologize to each other . We whisper future plans for northern vacations  --  a lonely house on the Irish Sea , on the Scottish moors . A few yards away from us my mother patrols the beach . She is statuesque , jeweled , coffee brown , golden-haired , dressed in barbaric colors . Her rich and deep voice booms over the beach . She laughs with friends , predictsthe lines of the next Paris collections , roars lunch orders at the waiters , commands women to oil their children , builds sand castles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his mattress , his eyes half closed with contentment , looking with admiration at his little family . " Hi , big shot ! " he calls out to Jeff . " How do you like our beach ? " " Well , it 's all right , " Jeff answers , " hut it 's a little noisy and crowded . " My stepfather pretends to be amused . " It 's so funny the way they repeat everything their father says . " My mother continues to pace the beach , Cinzano in hand , greeting and expounding . A tune sung by Les Playboys starts up on the jukebox . She shuffles her feet and swings her hips , singing , " Watu-si  --  comme c'est drole le Watu-si . . . " Thenher voice booms over us : " You may complain about this place , but everyone comes back . The most interesting people in Europe are here this morning . Over there in the green bikini is the editor of the most influential women 's magazine in France . Next to her is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cannes this year . Then there 's Tiki de Benzeville , the man with the most beautiful jewelry in Europe . And the top model for Queen magazine , and the former girl friend of the Prime Minister . One does not argue with winners . " She swigs her Cinzano down defiantly . " It 's so international , so gay . " Two women twenty years apart in age come toward us , greeting us in shrill polished English.  | " Here is my Zozo ! " my mother cries . " Here is your Minou ! " Zozo , a cigarette clenched between her lips , has a round , wizened chocolate-brown face familiar to me from photographs taken with my mother in the twenties . Her daughter , Minou , has the same mop of bright-red hair which I used to help her braid when we were children . We all rise , we all kiss . " But how you 've grown ! " Zozo exclaims to me . " Is n't it fantastic to have them here ! " my mother cries . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all three generations  --  canyou imagine my happiness ? " The two women link arms and prance toward the bar . Minou comes toward our umbrella . She is a successful businesswoman , still unmarried  --  one of those compact little Frenchwomen whom one sees at the wheels of sport cars , briskly dodging traffic in the thick of Paris rush hours . She settles under our umbrella with a diffident , pouting smile . We exchange the ritual greeting of our childhood . " Moumoute ! " I whisper to her . " Dear old moumoute , " she answers . And for Paul 's benefit we clarify our greeting : " Moumoutes " was a club we founded when we were nine years old . We sum up the conditions of membership . Moumoutes move furtively , soft-footedly , they are feline , secretive , mysterious , hearthlovingcreatures . Sleep , childhood , shade , privacy , corners , fogs , rainy days are moumoute . So are eating jam with a spoon , lickingchocolate off the cooking pot , crouching by the fire , hiding at length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moumoute , dogs and horses are not . Moumoutes are mysterious , selfish , and adept at imitating purring . We still say , whenever we meet , such and such a person is moumoute , such and such a place is not . " This beach is not moumoute , " Paul suggests . " But he must be one of us , " she whispers . " How could he have learned so fast ? " " I 'm a supermoumoute , " he says with a smile . " What are you doing , Minou , in this most unmoumoute place in the world ? "  | " It 's a duty tour . " She curls up snugly under the umbrella , wrinkles her freckled nose . " My flapper mother ! Her gayest days before the war were spent here . It continues her youth . She adores that crowded , noisy little house of hers . " " How well we know . Will they ever get disillusioned ? " A group of teen-agers behind us discusses heatedly the relativemerits of the new French cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DS , the trunk space in the 404 . " In the nineteen-forties Frenchmen discussed politics , " Paul says . " In the fifties , food and sex . And now it 's nothing but cars , cars , cars . " " Of course , it 's the new French obsession . The roads are impossible . " " It 's sheer hell . They 're so rude . They drive so badly . " " Stephanie , do you remember how empty the roads were in the summer of 1940 ? " Minou exclaims . " No one had any gasoline , so there were no cars . We were allowed to bicycle all day long on the main highway . We especially loved that part of the road where that ghastly camping spot is now . Do you remember that ride every night for milk ? " " God yes , there was a dark copse of pine woods to go through . In the fall it was already dark by milking time and I was terrified of the ride back . The big pine branches waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Papa 's death yet , but I dimly suspected it . Ever since then I 've imagined angels of death hovering over the roads here . Minou , do you realize that Papa 's death traumatized me so I 've never even dared to go back to Saint-Seran to visit his tomb ? " " You do n't mean it . You 've never been back ? " " No . I 'm still terrified . Anyhow , Minou , you used to laugh at me so because I did n't like to ride down that road at night . " " You were such a melancholy girl , " Minou muses . " So unlike your children ! They 're so gay ! Look at them play . " " Our parents are much gayer and more frivolous than we are , too . They make me feel quite old . "  | " Well , we 're that odd war generation , " Minou says . " I just want to survive and be left alone . . . . How are you surviving the family experiment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says laconically . " They keep saying how good it is for the children . " Minou laughs cynically . " As if our mothers ever knew what 's good for children . Do you remember ever spending one summer vacation with your mother ? We were always sent off somewhere with our governesses . " " Lunch ! " my mother calls out . " Lunch , everybody ! " She waves from the table where she and Zozo have been sitting , growing increasingly voluble over their cocktails . " I tell you Nene has lifted her face , " Zozo is asserting as we walk toward them . " But you never did believe anything I said . " " Well , I tell you she has not . Why should I believe what you say ? You 've always exaggerated everything . " " I know her better than you do . " " You do not . She confides everything to me . No one ever confided anything to you . " " What are you talking about ? " " Everyone knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I simply refuse to discuss this anymore , " Zozo says . She glares into her whiskey glass . We sit down . " Steak for everybody ! " my mother shouts . " Salad for everybody ! A lot of wine for everybody ! " The men in peppermint-striped trunks set plates in front of us . Paul cuts the children 's meat . My stepfather savors the wine . The children sink their teeth into their steaks . " Look at them eat , " my stepfather says . " Have you ever seen them eat so marvelously ? " " One 's the image of the father , the other 's the image of the mother , " Zozo says . " They are superb , beautiful , " Minou says . " This is the only immortality , " my mother says , " to be all lunching together at my beach . "  | " They are fat , lovely , like ripe peaches , " my stepfather says . " We must do this every year . " " When the Germans occupied France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole country over ? " " When a country occupies another country , " Jeff asks , " how come it does n't fall into the sea ? " " Boys , " Paul says , " come out of the sun . Do n't eat your lunch in the sun . " " But you 're going to kill those children with lack of sun , " my mother moans . " It makes their bones grow . " " There 's nothing worse for kids than too much sun at midday , " I say . " You used to love the sun , " my stepfather says . " You used to spend hours and hours just lying in the sun . " " Well , I ca n't take it anymore . I 've changed . " " You certainly have . " " They 've had too much sun and that 's all there is to it , " my husband says . " But how you 've grown , " Zozo says to me . " You 're still taller . How old are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she screams . " You are lying ! " She frowns , her head bending over her Scotch . " Of course , you 're Minou 's age . Perhaps you 're thirty-two after all . You came to us with your father for a weekend in ' thirty-nine , do you remember ? " Her face turns malicious , she tantalizes me with memories , as if offering candy to a child . " You were the little Stephanie he had to tuck in every night . Then he knelt at the bottom of your bed to say prayers . It was the spring before the war . How he adored you ! " " Yes , " my mother says curtly , " he adored her . " " And I made fudge in your kitchen , do you remember ? " I said . " And there was an invasion of caterpillars on your terrace . And my father ordered me my first pair of slacks . " " All that I do n't remember , " Zozo says vaguely.  |p151The  candy is withdrawn . I stare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep ruby red . At the neighboring table a former husband of Brigitte Bardot teases a marmoset . The animal is dressed in miniature bathing trunks and pulls pathetically at his leash . The ex-husband 's entourage shrieks and laughs over the animal 's antics . A voice wails on the jukebox , " Qu'on est bien clans tes bras . . . " Zozo continues talking with my mother about the old days . The time they won the Charleston contest , the day they swam across the Bay of SaintTropez , the time they drove to Rome without stopping to sleep . There was that Jewish banker crazy to marry Zozo , the American lawyer who wanted my mother to divorce for him , that Russian prince who was so poor and so handsome that they spent their evenings with him riding the Paris subways . ... I conjure up photographs of pale-faced , cupid-mouthed women in fedora hats , reclining , swathed in smoke , against the tufted banquettes of nightclubs or leaning on the gleaming surfacesof Ferraris . Their marcelled hair waves low over their brows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminate their slender legs . Minou and I stare warily at our flapper mothers . The gay , gilded past of the twenties and thirties floats past us like a perfumed barge . . . . I shut my inward eye , weary of comparisons . They continue to argue . " You 're wrong ; it was the summer of ' thirty-seven that we drove to Rome together , not ' thirty-six . " " I assure you it was the summer of ' thirty-six , " Zozo says . " I was with my second husband . We met on this very beach on the way back . " " You were n't with any husband at all . You were with that Andre de something or other . " " Whoever I was with , it was the summer I had my motorcyclingaccident and you had your car accident . " " You 've got the summers all twisted . " " Well , I simply refuse to argue with you any more ! " Zozop152exclaims . " You 're too stubborn , and besides I think your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And you live in the United States ? In the country ? You are not bored to death ? And I hear you do not like our South of France ? " " Well , there 's nothing much to see here except all these bodies . " He smiles glacially . " The interesting part of Provence is terribly far away . " " He 's an architect , he loves to look at architecture , " my mother explains . " Crypts , ruins , and all that . And also he loves nature . All Americans love nature . " " My son-in-law believes in the Dignity of Man and in Peace and Quiet , " my stepfather gibes . " He does not find them here . " " I might if I could sleep . " " Insomnia is a state of mind , nobody talked about insomnia in my generation , " my stepfather says . " I think I 'll call you the Tired Generation . " " And he does not dance any of the new dances , " my mother says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuses to set foot in a nightclub . " " Just like Minou . " Zozo sighs . We sip our coffee silently , dazed by the lunch wine . There is a mournful , very old Piaf record : " 11 etait blond , it etait beau ... it sentait bon le sable chaud . . . mon le-gion-nai-ai-re .... " The tables are vacated , the gleaming bodies lie at new angles , like needles of compasses , to absorb the rays of the slanting sun . " I 'm going to my massage , " Zozo announces . " I 'm going to take a cozy little nap , " Minou says . " I 'm going to take a walk , " my mother says . " Rest , my love , lie down , " my stepfather says . " It will do you good . " They go to their mattresses and lie hand in hand in the sun . My mother 's free hand continues to tap agitatedly on the sand to the rhythm of the jukebox . Minou has curled up under our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curled up against her chest . Paul lies on his back , arms akimbo . In his exhaustion he is the shell , the discarded rind of a man . " I ca n't work here ,  |p153I  ca n't read here , I ca n't sleep , I ca n't fuck , I can barely write a postcard , " he mutters . " June July August September and the summer 's over , " I whisper . It could be three , four , five o'clock  --  who can say ? I lie in the timeless umbrella of my family summer . Around us the sun worshipers have begun to intertwine . Bleached heads rest on male stomachs , sleek arms enlace with hairy thighs , men 's heads repose on half-naked breasts , nipples emerge from the flimsy stuff of brassieres , thighs rotate in the waning sun . The beach swells with oiled , flailing limbs , like an estuary gleaming with fish at mating time . The sight of the flesh , of the bared breasts , begins to fill me with nausea . My head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the umbrella , a cicada sings violently above the buzz of voices and the thud of the small waves . One of my flushed children appears , his face caked with sand and salt . " How do you say neck ' in French ? " he asks . " Everybodyon this beach is necking . " " Lie down in the shade , Jeffie darling , " I plead weakly . " You 've had too much sun . " But he 's off again , staging an attack on his brother 's sand castle . Peace , family peace , family love , it took me years to get it , let 's hold on . We must preserve it . L-O-V-E . Lucien , Octave , Victoire , Emile . Family love , through rage and war , war and peace , lies and fornication , boredom and disaster , marriage and madness . Stay sane , Stephanie , stay sane , stay snug for a while in your nice warm nest taking care of your birdies , and try not to suffocate ... . A shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You ca n't escape ! " He has thrown himself upon the back of a helpless , peeling German tourist , who acts politely bewildered . " I 've caught a German ! " We leap to our feet . We scold and apologize profusely . The German disappears , with a show of exquisite courtesy . " This is too much , " my stepfather says . " Why bring him up this way ? I 'm disappointed in you . Why bring him up with hatred ? "  | " Well , I hate the Germans , too , " Paul says . " What kind of an answer is that ? I 'm disappointed in you . " " Is n't France wonderful , darling ? " I ask Tommy diplomatically . " What do you like the best in France ? " " The accidents , " the child says . Then his face puckers up and dissolves into a howl . I pick him up . He is a baby again , clutching at my shoulders . " I 've said before that these children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this crazy beach for six whole hours ; it 's almost evening . " " Well , what 's wrong with being on the beach ? " my stepfathersays . " I work hard all year , I 'm on vacation , I want to enjoy my vacation . Ca n't you enjoy a day at the beach ? " We gather towels , moist bathing suits , sand pails , anti-sun lotions . My mother has a hurt look in her eyes . Her photograph of family unity is shattered . Zozo looks at us cynically , cigarette smoke swathing her leathery face . " Why do n't we take the children back ? " Minou says . " It 's right on our way , almost next door . " " Ca n't we go home , too ? " Paul whispers to me . " We 're supposed to meet those people for dinner at SaintTropez . Please , one more little show of togetherness . " Minou and I say goodbye . " Au revoir , moumoute . I 'll take good care of the children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid to put them to bed very early , and I 'll call her at eight . See you tomorrow , I hope ? " " Perhaps . " She shrugs , with her little dour smile . She goes off to her mother 's car , holding a child awkwardly by each hand . We walk back to our station wagon . My mother consoles herself by making plans for the next day . " Tomorrow Nene is coming for lunch here , and Renee , and Mimi . I must order a table for twelve or fourteen .... " We pack again into the Peugeot . The brilliant , raped landscapereels past us once more as we follow the thick line of traffic to Saint-Tropez . Pink stucco villas , gas stations , morep155campers ' tents , billboards of bronzed breasts and thighs dot the sparse groves of olive trees . Paul sits stalwartly in the back , arms folded on his chest . He is like a picture in the medical books depicting the nervous system : ganglia rawly exposed , neurons taut as violin strings . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning the pink of cyclamen . We circle in the port of Saint-Tropez , looking for a place to park . The little mooring bay is filled with opulent yachts . The quay is lined with fishermen 's houses transformed years ago into awninged cafes . The houses are blue , green , melon  --  confectioner 's colors . Brightly hued pennants fly from the masts of the boats . My mother heads toward the most crowded bar . " This is the place , " she says . " This cafe always was the place in the fifties , and look , everybody 's still here ! " A waiter salutes my stepfather 's tip . We sit down and take in the sights . Movie actors cruise the port in mauve-colored Opels . A crowd congregates around a French singing star . Jeweled men sit over cocktails on their yachts , scanning flesh through their binoculars . The in crowd pushes at the bar , jostling to be seen . The men wear tight pants and embroidered shirts . The girls wear thick false braids down their backs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lips that exaggeratesthe cultivated Negro hue of their skins . Thighs rotate in the neon lights , the stuff of clothing is stretched drum-tight over breasts and buttocks , the crowd ogles and appraises itself . " Is n't this fun , " my stepfather says . " So gay . So attractive . The girls are splendid .... " We sip our Dubonnets . Paul has buried himself in a new issue of the Paris Herald Tribune . My mother returns from her examination of the port . " Let 's go , let 's go , " she calls . " I 've reserved a table for dinner in a divine new club . Voom-Voom  --  is n't that a brilliant name for a nightclub ? Voom-Voom ! " " We 're going to go home and have a sandwich and go to bed , " Paul says.  | " But just come for a drink , then ! " she pleads . " Come see Voom-Voom ! " We walk down the port , passing shops filled with artists ' supplies , jazz records , tropical fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfasting nudists , plastic housewares , straw hats . Voom-Voom is in a narrow back street , a cave built into the cellar of an old fisherman 's house . The agitated African rhythms of 1963 thrust out of the cave . A few couples have already begun to gyrate . " I have a headache , " Paul says . " I 'm not going in there . " He has backed up against a shop window , and rows of fruitcolored , dwarf-sized bikinis frame his head . An alternating neon light pulsates through the beachwear shop , flushing the street with hues of peach , apricot , fuchsia . My mother is at the entrance of the blue cave , beckoning , swinging her hips to the rhythm of Les Playboys . " Come ! Come ! " she cries . " Come to Voom-Voom ! " My husband stands stalwartly on the pavement , pale-eyed , American , priggish , determined , firmly clutching my hand . " I am not going in there , " he repeats . " But just come for a look , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay , the decor is so amusing . " He does not budge . " I have a headache . I ca n't take that noise and that smoke . We 're going to find a taxi . " " Leave them alone , " my stepfather says gently . " They want peace and quiet . " " I 'll tell you all about it tomorrow , " my mother promises . She waves regretfully as she disappears into the cave . " And perhaps tomorrow you 'll change your mind . " Then we are in a taxi . The port sways behind us , pale masts against a violet sky . " Steamer balancant to mature , ' " I murmur . " Leve l'ancre pour une exotique nature ! .. " " Mallarme ? "  | " Right . " " I would n't mind raising my anchor . Goodness , family vacationscan be exhausting . " " But necessary . " " It 'll be great to be quiet and go to bed early for a change . Back to Come-and-Go . " He sighs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeeze his hand in return . We ride back in the dark to our selfish peace , our quiet caves , to his beloved refuge from the century 's noises . And across the bay , through the navy-blue Mediterranean night , wafts a tomtomlike sound of music , to which I suppose my mother is dancing , dancing.  | " What about Suez ? " Aunt Charlotte asked . " What about Algeria ? What about Vietnam ? Twenty years ! We have a lot of catching up to do . How curious of you not to have returned sooner ! " A very heavy woman , her flesh accreted like uncontrolled lava , was welcoming me back to Saint-Seran . I had finally gatheredthe courage to visit my father 's family again . Aunt Charlotte'ssilvery hair tumbled over an exorbitantly pink face , she held on her lap a piece of tapestry work and a large album of collected stamps . Inured by age and willful isolation , her mind swung giddily among historical cataclysms and recitations of family chronicles . All of my father 's brothers , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are there roads in America ? " she continued . " Do you eat bread in America ? What kind of bread ? What is the speed limit on your roads ? Did you do your studies in English or in American ? Do you remember how you used to skim the foam off the raspberry jam in our kitchen before the war ? Do you think you could send me some African stamps from the Unitedp162States ? Possibly you could find me some from Zaire . . . . Listen , dear child , we have all the room in the world for you . " And she pointed to the proliferation of bedding scattered about her living room and the entire house . It was the most startling feature of this dwelling I had not entered since the age of fifteen ; it made my long absence seem all the odder . There were army cots stood up helter-skelter against the eighteenth-century boiseries of the old library , folding beds crammed in the hallways , sleeping bags strewn about the little dining room to which Aunt Charlotte hobbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate Louis XIII staircasethat wound upstairs from the front entrance hall . This proliferation of sleeping arrangements contrasted bizarrely with the bleak gray walls hung with portraits of ancestors , the forbiddingcrucifixes dominating a wall of every room , the austerityof gray stone floors left uncarpeted since the German occupation . It gave Saint-Seran a warm and profligate bohemianism , testifying to the enormous number of grandchildren , great-grandchildren , nephews , nieces who flocked back here every summer with an eagerness which I found mysterious , seeing how terrified I had been of my own return . When my father was shot down over Gibraltar from the Spanish coast , presumably by German gunfire , he had been buried in the British cemetery . Nine years later his body had been brought back to France and reburied in the family vault near Saint-Seran . I had never dared to visit his grave . I had spent a good part of my life denying the reality of his death . And now as I finally sat facing Aunt Charlotte I was crippled by another fear that had haunted me for decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after my long absence for any return to be bearable , that I could never return . Rancor ? Quite the contrary ! My aunt 's gentle , inquisitive eyes seemed filled with gratitude at my visit . She lived all year long in this ancient house where I had spent some of my happiestchildhood holidays . Seventy-six years old , rooted to thep163first floor of the dwelling by her great weight , she was as frenetically curious about contemporary events as she was re-I uctant to witness them at first hand . And she treated my arrival as if it were the most precious of gifts  --  a marvelously riskless exposure to the modern world . " Do n't you dare think I 'm out of touch , " she announced emphatically , pointing to her large RCA television set , " even though I 've not once been to Paris since World War Two . It 's only a three hours ' train ride from Nantes nowadays , but there is something about the capital which most of our family has always disliked and feared  --  the many new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size . . . the craze for novelty . . . the foreign visitors ... " Her fingers fidgeting with a corner of her stamp album , her cane tapping agitatedly on the floor , she stared at her foreign visitor with the furtive , taunting excitement with which we sometimes stare at a tiger safely caged in a zoo . " You 're not going to tell me , in this house , " she challenged me within ten minutes of our first embrace , " that Algerian independence was not a monstrosity . Just think of your greatgreat-granduncle , General de Lamoriciere , who dedicated his life to conquering Algeria for France , and your father 's brother , Uncle Andre , whom independence left totally destitute at the age of sixty-seven . And now it 's the Algerians who are bankrupt ; we gave them freedom much too early for their own good , not even to speak of ours . What 's all this idea of liberty for children who do n't even know how to read , who barely know how to make a little camel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That 's one point on which I broke totally with our great de Gaulle , but God bless his soul , he may have been forced into it , he 's beyond reproach on all else . Tell me , are n't you afraid of an invasion of Chinese into the United States ? " No , I said , there were many things to fear , but that was not one of them.  | " Well , I 'd watch out if I were you , I think you 're overly optimistic . They just might turn out to be like the Africans in England or the Arabs here , drive you out of job and home . And what about Vietnam , what could you think of that atrocity ? How did you manage not to learn a lesson from our history and immediately get out ? What a frightful decade you must be living through ! " Yes , I said , I had been arrested once for taking part in a demonstration against the war in Vietnam . She clapped her plump little hands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bravo , bravo ! You 're one of us down to the last straw , that 's just what many of us would have done . Risk ! Acting out one 's conscience always entails some risk . I must tell you that several of your second cousins who were in the underground have never really recovered from their experience in concentration camps even twenty years later . Foreigners tend to forget how scarred we still are by the war , how many generations it takes for these wounds to heal . By the way , I suppose you 're going to visit your father 's grave tomorrow or the day after ? " Yes , I said , it had been very much on my mind to do that . " Well , Stephanie , there is something you do not know about him that is very important for you to know . You see , after we saw you here last we heard from the chaplain in Gibraltar that all the men on your father 's plane were still conscious when they crashed upon the beach , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched my face closely , waiting to be rewarded with an expression of gratitude , which did not come . For the first time , she seemed irritated with me . " But you live in a world of delusions , my dear ! You do n't seem to realize what joy it gave us to know that he had received the last sacrament ! Just think how ghastly it would have been if the plane he was on had fallen into the sea like the others , if we had n't been able to eventually bring his body here . You see ,  |p165God  always gives us something to be grateful for , if you look at life in the right way . " And she crossed herself with great cheerfulness . I stared at the crucifix hanging above the television set alongsidea picture of de Gaulle , and the family 's hallowed dead , thinking yes , this was the kind of grim detail I must be prepared to face here , that I had felt incapable of facing up to now . At such times my mind took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the verdant countrysideabout me : " Vendee , a maritime department of western France adjoining the southeast boundary of Brittany , one of France 's most conservative districts , was the region which most fiercely resisted the Revolution in 1793 . The Chouans , peasant bands well documented in the Balzac novel named after them , instigated a series of Royalist insurrections which lasted well into the nineteenth century . . . . " The landscape out of Aunt Charlotte 's window was as flat as any in my memory , there was not a hillock , not a rock , to disturb the monotonous platitude of its horizon . A serene , dead-straight alley of luxuriant chestnut trees stretched from the little castle to the country road . To the left stood some dilapidated buildings that had once served as stables and servants ' quarters . The old greenhouse to the right of the entrance had also been abandoned since the war , when the family fortune declined sharply . In the flower beds circling about the castle 's entrance only the simplest and most tenacious of flowers  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumps of weeds . " Now for the family albums , " Aunt Charlotte was saying . " Let 's start with 1936 , we 'll do ' thirty-seven in the afternoon , and perhaps ' thirty-eight after tea if we 're not too tired . Well , here you are , aged five , with your cousin Daniel , who 's coming from Nantes to lunch with you . There you are with Louise , your oldest cousin , who is coming from Paris tomorrow to see you . And look at that sweet picture of you with Catherine , who is coming to meet you here this afternoon . Ah , here 's onep166of you with your father and all five of your Saint-Seran cousins , mercy how they adored him , he was their hero . . . " She lingeredwith particular affection upon a photo of my father surrounded by a pack of children  --  we were swarming and climbing up his limbs as if he were a huge oak tree , gamboling on the stoop of the ancestral door which I had avoided for so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess as many as I did . Throughout the day they tumbled out of Aunt Charlotte 's albums as prolifically as the camp beds set out to accommodate them , testifying to the redoubtable fact that in other parts of France my father 's other three brothers had each borne a minimum of five children , most of whom had also had five or six of their own , and that all thirty or forty of them came back here every summer . It was awesome , this proliferation of shared protoplasm , to someone who had been brought up kinless in the New World . Every few hours some new batch of my tribesmen would arrive , each greeting me with different tones of curiosity , irony , emotion . " It 's very nice of you to come back after all these years , " my cousin Daniel hollered at me from the front door , by way of greeting , " awfully good of you to finally come back ! " I stared back at him with particular curiosity , for he was depicted in one of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed us together at the age of eight or nine , both sucking on lollipops and dressed in white for someone 's First Communion . My arm was linked through his , and he looked miserable under my possessive embrace  --  I had been madly in love with him at that age . He was now a tall , angular businessman in his thirties with great fangs of tobacco-stained teeth . " You could have given us some sign of life earlier , you know , " he continued to roar . " Awfully strange behavior . Strange notion of family you have in the United States . We 've always heard you had no great sense of family or of the past.  |p167Well  , my dear , you 're a living proof . So you 've finally decided to come back . We were never about to spank you or anything for staying away . Your father was one of my best friends when I was a child . A hero to us all , God knows . Every few years our magazines still ask for a picture of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resistance . I 'd have recognized you in a crowd a hundred yards away ! Ah , well , give us a kiss , it 's good to have you back ! " And he embraced me powerfully , exhaling pungent odors of Gitanes . It was almost time for lunch . On this August holiday  --  theFeast of the Assumption of Mary  --  young cousins from Nantes , from Rennes , from Brest , kept flocking unannouncedto the family house , arriving on motorcycles and in quatre chevaux with the suddenness with which a lover surpriseshis mistress on an idle afternoon . " Yes , here they are , " Daniel said pointedly , " they 've got a sense of family . Properly brought up people . You ca n't keep them away . " The helter-skelter village girl in charge of Aunt Charlotte 's housekeeping scurried about , peeling more potatoes , picking more tomatoes . " It 's always like this in the summers , " Aunt Charlotte grumbledgood-naturedly as she hobbled about , masterminding the frantic resetting of the table , " sometimes we 're three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a little phone call , I who try to build my life around accurate and precise reception of world news , lunch at twelve sharp so I can get the one o'clock informations , dinner punctually at seven so I can see the best of the evening reports ... " With an entrancing blend of formality and confusion , a long series of courses  --  melon , fish , chicken , a vegetable , salad , cheese , fruit  --  were served separately , on seven changes of slightly chipped two-hundred-year-old family china . " We hear you 're a writer . So what do you write about in America ? " Daniel shouted over the table . " Oh , my God , cur/rent events ? I do n't know how you can keep up with them , where you live . " " Where 's Dayton , Ohio ? " asked a young cousin who had arrivedfrom Nantes on his motorcycle . " In the center of your country or on the coast ? " " You have only two children ? Why such a small family ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or football ? " " Has n't Dr. Spock had a terribly pernicious influence on your young people ? " " What are the speed limits on your roads ? " " Absolutely monstrous of you to pressure your President Johnson with those filthy antiwar demonstrations , " Daniel broadcast over the fish course . " You elect him with the greatest plurality in history , and then you make life hell for him . What 's all this hysteria ? I repeat , you have no sense of history . You should have avoided the whole mess by profiting by our example , but once you 're in , full steam ahead . All your puritanicalnonsense about corruption in South Vietnam , it 's so naive . What do you think politics are all about ? Did anyone raise an eyebrow when Napoleon pillaged Italy ? " He washed down his fish with a large mouthful of Montrachet . " Did anyoneprotest when Louis XIII had his opponents jailed ? How else can you run a country ? In messing up your Johnson you 're thinking of yourselves , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not very elegant . " It was the hottest day of the summer . Some twelve of us were crowded into the tiny dining room furnished with frayed , weathered Louis XV chairs and piles of sleeping bags . All the windows were tightly shut . The crucifix hanging over the door to the kitchen was ornamented with dried palm and bay and surmounted a receptacle for holy water . Everyone except me had gone to Mass that morning . The three nieces I had acquiredat lunch that day were large and pretty , with that high-toned , Irishlike complexion typical of the Vendee and Brittany . The prettiest  --  one of Daniel 's daughters  --  wore ap169thin-strapped mini-skirted gingham dress that looked like an elongated bathing suit . " You should have put something on top of that decollete today , " her father grumbled . " Monsieur le cure almost had a stroke when he gave you Communion this morning . " " Do n't worry , Papa , " she minced saucily , putting her arms over her large and beautiful breasts , " I crossed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in between . " Her father guffawed . What an unpredictable lot , I thought , I rather like them . I fancied their blend of conservatism and earthiness , their extraordinary fear of fresh air . Halfway through coffee , almost fainting from the heat , I pleaded the beauty of the midday light on the castle 's facade and went out to take a photograph and breathe . The pretty niece followed me . " Stop , stop , do n't take it yet ! " she cried as I focused the camera . " There 's a window open on the second floor , it looks so awful ! " She ran up to close it and quickly ran back . " Now take it , " she ordered , staring beatifically at the pale symmetrical structuresurmounted by silvery slopes of gray mansarded roofs . I obeyed . Click : my ancestors ' home . With all its windows shut , the little castle , glimpsed through its alley of chestnut trees , looked as impervious to the flow of history as to currents of air , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picture in a coloring book which each of us could fill in with our particular obsessions . Papa had spent his childhood here , had helped to nurse his mother through a dreadfully lingering cancer . I had learned that detail only today . The Benjamin of the lot , he had been nine when she died , the same age I was at his death , and had remained alone with his older sister Colette while his father and brothers were away at the First World War . Had those years of sorrow and of solitude helped to shape his need for heroism , for early death ? Here we had slept in the same bed , during some weeks of each summer , in that secondfloorroom which I refused to visit . And two years ago the lastp170of my surviving uncles had died here , quietly sitting in his armchair ; a wave of sorrow suddenly filled me for not having seen him one last time , there was no one left now of my father 's generation except Aunt Colette , whom I was to visit tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always totally too late ... . The pretty cousin hollered to a bevy of her contemporaries , and we all took a walk in the park . It struck me that there was literally nothing to do at Saint-Seran but wallow in family historyand walk through forests . There was not a pond or a river to bathe in or a movie to go to , no horses , no tennis , no town to shop in within a half hour 's driving distance , nothing , nothing , nothing . Nothing but la promenade clans le beau pare . And here were these hordes of young persons in their late teens and early twenties who had the means to go to the mountains or to the Cote d'Azur , but who preferred to lounge about this sweet dormant structure ; with nothing else to do but study Aunt Charlotte 's family albums , glue into them the weddings and baptisms of the year , or walk through alleys of trees , commentingon the beauty of sunlight as it hit the oaks , a stand of elms , a cluster of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when filled with a sense of adventure , they employedthemselves by cutting down some brush to enlarge the park 's old alleys , or began the grave task of tracing the beginnings of a new one . " So you come here every summer for your vacation ? " I asked the pretty cousin . " Of course , " she exclaimed , as if I were mad to ask such a question . She worked as a bank clerk in Brest , and had five brothers . " You like it better than the sea , or the mountains ? " " We come here to recapture our childhoods , " she said as if announcing something totally uncontestable . " Do n't you like to recall your childhood ? What is there more beautiful than bathing in the past ? " she added dreamily , hitching up a strap of her bathing suit  --  church dress . " Oh , I ca n't tell you howp171attached we all are to this place , every single one of us . Look , it is so pretty from here , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squinted her eyes to admire the silvery structure , whose gray slate roofs sloped gently down to its long , narrow closed windows . History , loyalty , continuity . It would take me some time to realize that my cousins ' attachment to Saint-Seran was dictated by a quest for roots that was also a reassurance of immortality , that they achieved some peace by bathing in the aura of the ancestral dead . And if there were an occasional glance of defiance , of irritation , admixed with the burning curiosity my cousins bestowed upon me , it was because I was the only descendant who had refused to continue this linkage , who had once attempted to scrub myself clean of family memories , who had tried to forge a false innocence by shutting myself off from the griefs of the past . Destroy , New World immigrant , destroy , destroy , destroy . Destroy the forest , destroy the past , be free again from the pain of history . There is a recurring nightmare that has haunted me in various forms , over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still alive somewhere , and hiding ; that he is avoiding me , that he has just reasserted his refusal ever to communicate with me again . The dream recurs one night that very summer in Nantes , where I have taken a hotel room , twenty minutes from Saint-Seran . I dream that my Aunt Colette and I are on a plane that has made a crash landing . We are not hurt but seem to be the only survivors , and massive debris is scattered all about us . We receive a message that my father is alive and well in some distant country , that he is crippled and confined to a wheelchair but still strong and magnificent , that he is happily married to a much younger woman and refuses more adamantly than ever to communicate with us . " Traitor ! " Colette and I scream together upon receiving the news . " Traitor , traitor ! " On the morning after this dream  --  the day I was to see Auntp172Colette again for the first time in twelve years  --  I took a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obsessions of the night . And I tried to remember that time twenty years ago , after the war 's end , when I had returned to Saint-Seran and found my father 's absence there so insupportable , and had fled after twenty-four hours . During the war years in the United States I had romanticized the family house  --  the way my cousins did now  --  as that place where reality was unsurpassed in its perfection . And I had rushed there alone as soon as travelingbecame possible . I was fifteen , childishly unaware of my relatives ' suffering or of the toll of the war . The pain of the visit was bound to be augmented by the fact that my mother 's anxiety about the past had kept her from ever mentioning my father to me , and that I doggedly continued to believe he was still hiding in the Resistance underground long after I had learned he was dead . And pain still reduces my memory of the visit to images of catatonic brevity : Saint-Seran is a crumbling structure set in a stretch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Charlotte is fat . One of my cousins is in the colonies . Another one is trying to leave for the colonies . The oldest cousin , the wan pious Cecile whom I used to visit in her tower room , had died a few days before she was scheduled to enter a convent . Nantes is one of the three French towns most brutally destroyed in World War II . Aunt Colette lives in one pathetic room overlooking the rubble of the bombed-out port . We sit down to a prisonlike supper of watery soup in which float stony hunks of dry bread . The next morning I am taken to visit the place where my father will be buried when his body is brought home from Gibraltar . The cemetery is overgrown with brush , and the dank family chapel is filled with the tombs of ancestors whose history is meaningless to me . I remember little but the high grass , the dampness of the chapel 's stone walls , my dumb pain and anger . With anger I stared at what would be his final resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you abandon me ? I think I needed to break down right therep173and accept the reality of his death , I needed to lie on his tomb and flail my limbs about in some grim but necessary exorcism of emotion , demanding to pierce into the earth , to be reunited with his bones . But they were not even there . The absence of his body was like a double treason , further augmenting the treason that was his death . I had insisted on taking the next train back to Paris and had wept for days , refusing to eat , unable to stop crying , not knowing precisely why I was crying  --  a minor breakdown , perhaps . When I had come to live in Paris eight years later , at twentythree , I had steeped myself in my mother 's world and elaboratelysteered clear of any contact with my father 's immediate family , as my mother always had . Eventually I ran into Aunt Colette , the adored older sister who had taken care of him when their parents died and who had been one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by accident at the home of distantcousins . Since it was her only trip to Paris since 1947 , when she had come to receive a Legion of Honor for her work in the Resistance , I suppose she had come in great part to try to see me . She was very poor . The trip was difficult for her . Her eyes had devoured me across the room . I did not have the honesty or kindness to return her gaze . I was terrified of this proud , gentle woman who had worn mourning since my father 's death , who was my last link to my total childhood . " It would be so nice to see you , even here , " she had said , intimating that she would prolong her stay in Paris if I could grant her a few hours . But I had lied and said that I was going away that same evening to Italy . Those were years when I could not bear to hear the mention of my father 's name . And I had rejected her as crassly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more crassly , since she was so totally alone in the world , since along with me she had mourned him more deeply than anyone else . Walking through Nantes today toward Aunt Colette 's apartment on a summer day in the nineteen-sixties . Past the greatp174castle of Anne of Brittany , where white swans glide tranquilly in deep lily-filled moats . Past the monument to Jules Verne , born in this city , past the factory which manufactures the nice biscuits Petit Beurre Lu , Lu Lustucru . The city is bathed in that silvery light of the upper Atlantic coast , we are in Gaelic , Celtic country here , the light is like the gleam on a pear , all seems spun in webs of fragile silver . Past the docks famous for the drownings of the Revolution , when some two thousand Royalists , their hands bound to their sides , were marched into boats that were sunk in the River Loire . Past the house where Aunt Colette and my father were born . My grandmother was a great beauty and painted with talent ; during World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am thirty-five and have learned that only yesterday . I suddenly need to see and own a picture of them , very well , all 's easy now , I 'll ask Aunt Colette . A student in theatrical peasant costume hands me a pamphlet on the Breton liberation movement . Another Breton liberationist , incongruous in blue jeans and formal white lace headdress , hands me an antiabortion pamphlet in Gaelic . Three hippies with angelically long blond hair sit on the sidewalk in the morning sunshine , washing their feet in the gutter as they would on a summer day in any town in Europe . World War II has ended , Dien Bien Phu , Suez , Algeria , have come and gone , and the dead are coming home from Vietnam , and I am walking down a street called Cours John Kennedy . Some new courage buttressesme this morning , making all kinds of new emotions and meetings possible , as if this visit has finally thrust me out of childhood . I come to the address Aunt Colette has given me , to the door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cathedral . An extraordinary face stares at me through the window . A delicate face as fragile and carefully painted as a moth 's , ruled by enormous and melancholy eyes . All over the moth 's face large furry tufts of silvery hair grow in mad , erratic spurts , as they might on some wood sprite , on a creature half human ,  |p175half  tree . Aunt Colette so clearly has my father 's and my eyes  --  ironic , sad , gay eyes with deeply chiseled lids  --  that this is the way one of my cousins had found me at the airport : she had simply walked up to me , extended her hand , and said , " You have Aunt Colette 's gaze . " The moth 's face leaves the window , and a few seconds later a person weighing some seventy pounds , with the frail , erect , boyish body of an aging ballerina , opens the door . She is eighty years old . She has still a different way of greeting me . She falls into my arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoicism keeps her eyes quite dry . " Well , here you are at last , " she says during our long embrace . I am shaking , too . " Forgive me , " I want to cry , " forgive me for my lies and my evasions . " But I know that I can never use such terms with her , that this frail , subtle , solid woman prefers not to resort to words , that everything between us will be accomplished as in a choreography of insects . Very soon thereafter we sit down to lunch . One must alwayseat . Among the decorous , the diffident , the French , much pain and joy is punctuated by appropriate mundanities over the solemnity of a five-course meal . " Did you do your studies in British or in American ? " she asks , her eyes devouring me , our gaze meeting straightforwardlyacross the table laden with fragile Saint-Seran china . " Do you eat much bread in America ? What color is the bread ? Do you have Trotskyists in America ? How many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our troubles here , are n't they responsible for your black uprisings ? What do you think of the Pope ? I hear from Aunt Charlotte that you receive dissident priests for tea , it has become much the fashion here too , deplorably . Have you reread Sainte-Beuve lately ? Do n't you agree with him that the progress of civilizationis accompanied by a terrible degeneration of morals in mankind ? Is your stepfather Catholic ? Oh , he is Jewish . Ah , well , the Pope has forgiven them .... " In this willfully remote province , reality seems to filterp176through prisms that block out many aspects of modern civilizationyet enlarge others into obsessive proportions  --  Trotskyists , speed limits , the color of bread . Aunt Colette 's voice is as light and striking as her person , thin but powerful , with a silverytint to it recalling the light that bathes her city , frequently punctuated with pealing , boyish laughs . She retired fifteen years ago from her work as a librarian , and lives in a modest but dainty three-room flat filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacups , residues of Sevres porcelain , miniatures of ancestors on fragile Louis XVI tables , spindly chairs covered in worn petit-point rose patterns that seem as if they could support no more than her weight . Even the crucifixhanging on the wall by the inevitable photograph of de Gaulle is spindly and ethereal . She shares her flat with a childhoodfriend , also a spinster , and by pooling their resources they have somehow reconstituted comfort out of their postwar poverty . And I rejoice in Colette 's ease and her lack of solitude , as if these amenities  --  those of her own resourcefulness  --  could reducemy guilt . Perhaps desiring to emphasize our birthright to decorousness , she feasts me , as Aunt Charlotte has done , with a procession of courses served on five different sets of china . I protest , in midmeal , that one could eat the vegetables with the meat instead of separately , would n't it make her dishwashing easier ? " Oh , no , " she rebuts , her voice crackling with indignation , " eat like the Germans , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most disgusting custom I know . Why , even when we go on picnics in the forest we bring at least four changes of china . " I am regaled by tales of her frequent trips to the country , of her vociferous reading , of her prodigious passion for bridge . She plays bridge at least four afternoons a week , being , like most members of our family , " of a nature driven to excess . " She frequently entertains groups of ten friends in her flat for two-table bridge parties ; since they are all quite old , she explains , there are always two players dropping out and nappingp177in the other room , resting up for their turn to play . She goes every August to vacation on the island of Oleron with a few friends her age . Over the years they have chosen a particular hotel for its proximity to beautiful trees and also to a church where they can go to Mass every morning . " I adore forests , " she says , " the joy of my life is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and observe the play of sunlight on different kinds of trees . In Oleron we always carry a folding card table into the forest and spend the afternoon playing our bridge match there , enjoying the effect of afternoon sunlight on the leaves . . . . Tell me , do you have insomnia ? " Yes , deplorably so , ever since a certain period of the war . " Bravo , then you 're really one of us ! " she exclaims , acknowledgingthe reference to my father 's death with a wise , sad look but preferring not to dwell upon it . ( For she , who knows more about him than anyone else , never offers any detail more tellingthan " He hated his braces as a child , " or " He passed his exams marvelously . " ) " You might even have had insomnia without the war , " she continues . " That 's a trait from the Lamoriciere side which plagues most of us . For instance , your grandfather , a colonel in the professional Army , read and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annecy or in Algeria . Your Uncle Jean used to read Michelet from two to six A.M. , he slept three or four hours a night and hunted five hours each day ; he lunched at ten and dined at four . . . as for my white nights , I reread de Gaulle 's memoirs . " " Why this anxiety ? " I ask . " Are we romantics ? " She nods her head emphatically with an ironic smile . " Oh , yes , indeed , we 've always been romantics . " " In what sense ? " " We 're concerned with heroism , " she ventures slowly , " and the future of our actions , and how they relate to the past . Oh , by the way , have you been there yet ? No ? You are going tomorrow , with your cousin Catherine ? Very well . Do you like de Gaulle ? " she asks hurriedly , as if to get ourselves back on safer ground.  | " A great man , " I answer carefully , " perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than immediateones . " " But you do think he is great ? " " Oh yes . " " Thank God , " she simply says . " All these modern trends , I just do n't know about them . . . these Cabinet ministers whose wives allow themselves to be photographed in bathing suits .. . these birth-control pills handed out by the state to anyone .. . those hooligans who salute you with clenched fists .... " She noticed , before lunch , that I looked longingly at a photograph of my father on her bedside table . And after taking a brief nap to rest for the afternoon excursion we have planned , she comes out of her bedroom , swiftly handing me an envelope . She gives it to me between one room and another , with an air of contraband and one of those infinitely sad , wise looks of hers . Our sorrows flutter , hover about each other like languorous moths . We look at each other with that melancholy , ironic gaze that belongs to her , to him , to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We stroll in the Botanical Gardens , and admire the play of sunlight on its elms and oaks . She wears a gown of watered silk , a sweater reaching halfway to her knees , long pearls , her legs are like matchsticks , her nails are painted the color of fading tea roses . She helps me to feed the swans in the moated castle of Anne of Brittany , as she did when I was a child . I take her photograph on the cathedral steps as she clutches her extraordinarily flowered hat in a gust of wind , saying , proudly , " We have the highest nave of any church after Beauvais . " At day 's end we drive to visit distant maiden aunts of mine whom even Colette refers to as " the guardians of the past . " They have lived totally alone since the end of World War I  --  when both their parents died  --  in a magnificent Louis XIII castle they have dedicated their lives to preserving . Smell of damp wood , splendor of moldings not painted since the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One aunt is seventy , the other is eighty . Bent and elflike and totally eccentric , too poor to employ a servant , they live and cook , each one for herself , in different floors of the great house , keepingvastly different hours and savoring totally different styles of life . One cultivates the flower garden and sweeps the castle 's thirty-six uninhabited rooms , the other spends her day doing the heavy outdoor work , maintaining LeNotre 's alleys with a John Deere garden tractor . They have not been to Nantes in three , four years . It is a twenty-minute ride away . Before an array of harps and ancient harpsichords , the peeling dank walls of the grand salon  --  which they open only every few years for special guests  --  are hung with pictures of great dead Frenchmen . We are briefly left to ourselves while our cousins make tea . " Ah , look , there 's de Gaulle , " Aunt Colette jubilates as she advances slowly into the salon , unfolding her lorgnette . " No , Aunt Colette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merde alors , " she exclaims , " I must admit that I have n't been in this room for years and that I 've never mentioned de Gaulle 's name to them , they might think I 'm a Communist . " After tea we stroll out into the park and walk in the alleys designed by LeNotre . " Look , what an exquisite oak , of the species Quercus virginiana , " Aunt Colette murmurs , " and what a noble elm , of the Ulmus procera species . " Our seventy-yearoldrelative rides past us on her electric carriage , dressed in boots and ancient riding jodhpurs , a khaki army hat set cockily on her head . " What dedication , what sacrifice , " Aunt Colette says . " This house is their child , their martyrdom , their immortality . You see , perhaps that 's why we 're such insomniacs in the family . We 're romantic enough to dedicate our lives to any cause we believe in , however small or great . " " Do you believe in grace ? " my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flat countryside outside Nantes inp180the direction of the family chapel where my father was buried . It was her way of being mundane , I suppose , of diverting me from the trouble that might lie ahead . She was a singular woman , this husky , serious cousin who had undertaken to accompanyme on my first visit to my father 's grave : the only spinster of her generation in the family , tall , powerful , with short gray hair brushed back in mannish fashion and steelrimmedglasses framing the family 's melancholy , straightforwardeyes . She was the cousin who had met me at the airport , and I had immediately sensed that as the spinster of the family she assigned herself the more disagreeable and awesome family tasks : helping to cook and keep house for her aging mother , my Aunt Charlotte , meeting strangers at airports , accompanyingthem on delicate missions such as this one . As if it were her way of punishing herself , within this family hell-bent on procreation , for failing to reproduce God 's image . She was a governmentsocial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system which entailed attending a monthly meeting in Paris . And she was utterly consumed by her duty toward others . She lived in a phoneless two-room flat in Nantes . Anyoneattempting to find her there in the evening would learn that instead of going home to put her feet up and do her laundry , as she constantly announced she was about to do , she had gone to check on some particularly bereaved family in the suburbs , or rushed to Saint-Seran to make sure that her mother 's dinner was properly taken care of . Her manner had that balance that characterizes the finest members of her profession  --  those equipped with enough diplomacy and toughness to deal adequatelywith drunks , drug addicts , the orphaned , the handicapped . And she had asked me , in that diverting tone appropriatefor the day 's excursion , whether I believed in grace . " I 'm not sure that we would see eye to eye on that . " I was trying to avoid the severe cultural shock that some of my answers evoked among my relatives . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the exclusive vehicle of salvation . I thinkp181grace can be attained through the visions of many other great religions , and also outside of them . " How flat the countryside was on the way to the chapel . My answer seemed startling and novel to her , but not totally shocking . " Ah , how interesting , Stephanie , " she exclaimed . " You do not believe in Christ as the hinge , the joint that relates God to man  --  you think one can reach grace through Buddha , or the Hindu deities , or some curious Moslem sect ? " " And why not without them , since they all stress that He is in us already ? I think there are many persons untaught in any religion who have grace because they are able to live totally for the other . " " Total sacrifice for the other , certainly , as you find in all our saints , " she agreed . " But how would you recognize a state of grace among the unbaptized ? " " Well , their sainthood might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of any surer sign than their willingness to risk going into death for others . And I 'm not sure that such grace can be reached without the most scrupulous selfknowledge , and it is this knowledge , this total givingness , that is of the essence , not the contact with any religious system . " She was frowning . " Look at all the lies we invent to protect our self-esteem and self-respect , " I continued . " I talk about this a lot with a great Jesuit friend of mine . He 's always stressing our unwillingness to face the reality of death , our arrogance in thinking that we are Godlike and immortal . " " What do you mean , thinking that we are immortal ? We are all immortal ! I am immortal ! You are immortal ! That is preciselyhow we differ from animals ! What does our catechism say ? Because I have an immortal soul ' ! " ( " Really , " her eyes were saying to me , " you Americans go too far , even your priests ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you think , and we just phrase them differently . I 'd say that we differ fromp182animals by our awareness of death , and that this awareness of death might be the sign of our potential for some form of immortality , a manifestation of some kind of immortal world soul . " Stopping at a red light , still frowning , she offered me a package of licorice and mint candy drops which she kept in a pouch in her car  --  along with comic books and a manual for self-defense  --  for the adolescents she had to transport back and forth to the rehabilitation home . " To get back to grace , " I continued , trying to soothe her back into the conversation , " I am trying to document a story about a humble nineteenth-century servant girl who rescued a child and then died herself as a result . She was so devoid of illusions , so completely willing to cross into death for the sake of another human being , that she was a perfect example of a state of true grace . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Oh , we get very few foreign films , " she said . " As a matter of fact we get very few ideas of any kind from the outside . While you in America , on the contrary , must be veritably swamped , inundated , by fresh and novel ideas . How curious that must feel ! " She ran her large hand through the stubby hair with a gesture that communicated impatience , some envy . " Does n't this profusion of new ideas , this perennial invasion , sometimes make you feel ... out of balance ? To be perpetually bombarded by such a stream of novelty ? " " Yes . It 's a country where it 's sometimes hard to keep track of reality . Everything flows by us so very swiftly  --  fads , allegiances . Your brother Daniel loves to attack me for our lack of any sense of history . " " Do you know , Stephanie , that in the ten years I have had to make monthly trips to Paris I have spent the night there only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even though it 's only three hours by train , I did it only once , when my sister Louise offered me a ticket for a performance of the Saintp183Matthew Passion in Notre-Dame . But I felt so guilty for having offered myself this luxury that I took the six A.M. train back to Nantes , and then I worked for twenty-four hours around the clock to get rid of my unease . " I stared at her with the same intense curiosity with which my French cousins often stared at me . " You see , darling , " Aunt Colette had said , " we are all so nutty , so excessive ... " " Go on , talk some more , " Catherine said , " you 're such a breath of fresh air . Tell me how you really feel about this place , why you finally came back when you did . " We would be arriving at the chapel soon . The ancient fear gripped me . I sensed that I could talk freely to her . " Well , I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa 's grave . It 's as if . . . well , as if he could drag me down with him , as if he had the power to force me to join him in death . And so I was too much of a coward and a louse , too small and ungenerousto honor his memory . It 's as if  --  to get back to what we were saying a minute ago  --  as if I dared to think I could never be touched by death , and refused to acknowledge any aspect of it . If it were n't for the advice of my Jesuit friend , Father Gregory , I 'd never have dared come back . I was equally fearful of some ill will on the part of the family here , fearful that they might bear me a grudge for never coming back . And every year it grew worse , every year I feared it more . That part of it was silly , you 've been so marvelous to me . " She gave me a proud , forthright grin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd be . Not necessarilyabout Buddhism or foreign films , but about things like pain and death and a child 's emotions toward them . Do you know , I understand your fears totally . Someone once wrote  --  who could it have been , Mauriac perhaps ?  --  that upon the death of a parent , a child is like a reed bent by a heavy storm . He may straighten up in time , or he may not . He may have to live perpetually in a stooped position , in a condition of enfeeblement . Also , what happened in your particular instancep184is quite clear  --  a child who is not properly acquainted with the facts of a parent 's death may suffer from powerful delusions , complex feelings of guilt . One , you feel guilty that you did not join him in death . Two , you feel guilty that in some vague sense you are responsible for his death . Three , because you were not given the chance of going through the proper rituals of mourning  --  thesethings exist for the sanity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may still refuse to believe that he is dead . " Her conciseness stunned me . Cartesian clarity , one , two , three , like a prize-winning French high-school essay . And so much briefer , clearer , cheaper than the shrink . I could not speak . " What about life after death ? " she asked in the same conversational , mundane tone with which she had ventured into grace . " Or the resurrection of the body , things like that ? In a system of thought as progressive as yours , what would you have to say ? " " Oh , I do n't have any great problems with it . It 's the transfiguredbody , after all . I 've always been absolutely obsessed with that concept . Remember how in catechism we used to ask , What is the transfigured body ? ' and they 'd answer , Ah , my child , that is a mystery . ' I do n't admire the notion because the Church teaches it but because it 's such a brilliant historical solution ; after all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the genius to come along and say , You can take your body too . ' Anyway , there might well be a residuum of self that is not reducible to material quantities , the nature of which science may never be able to decipher . And if so , why not a continuity , or even a resurrection , of this selfhood ? " " Well , speaking of that , here we are , " she said , putting on her wide , comforting social worker 's smile . " Here 's the town where they 're all buried . " It had come earlier than I had thought , a bare half hour from Nantes and Saint-Seran . I felt a kind of numbness . That bluntp185wisdom of Catherine 's had made everything much easier than I had expected . " Look , " I said , " I might break down , okay ? I just do n't know yet . I hope you 'll understand . " She made a casual gesture of dismissal , as if to say , " If you only knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Louis-Christophe-Leon Juchault de Lamoriciere , who helped complete France 's conquestof Algeria and briefly served as its governor , is so revered in his native Vendee that no one is quite sure which part of him is buried where . His heart  --  that much is certain  --  is preserved within a gigantic black marble cenotaph in the north nave of the Nantes cathedral . It is said that at the insistence of the very first colonialists another parcel of his mortal body was buried in Algeria . One of my aunts suggests that still another slice of the General reposes in a Paris church . But whatever remains of him after these cannibalistic acts of veneration is buried in his native village of **28;3154;TOOLONG , in a family chapel built by the General 's sisters . It was here that my father came to rest some seventeen years ago . As one drives into Saint-Philbert , the General 's connection with that town is announced by a twelve-foot-high bronze statue that shows him striding into battle , his bearded intense face  --  not unlike Lenin 's  --  surmounted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky as if giving the signal of attack . Below him a Zouave soldier in native robes bows in deference and blows his war trumpet . At the General 's feet sits Marianne , symbol of French glory and justice , naked to the waist , her large and perfect breasts surmounting the noble flow of classical draperies below . And to the left of Marianne an Arab woman kneels in tribute , offering her a large basket of native fruit and flowers  --  the fruits of the Algerian colonies for France . The family 's burial chapel stands two blocks from this martial statue , in a village cemetery dotted with marble or stone crossesp186of varying degrees of grandeur , and with the purple and crimsonceramic flowers that adorn many French tombs . It was this site , this building , which I had been trying to avoid for over twenty years . What a goddam bitch reality is , I thought as I walked in , will she always remain as elusive and stingy with her symbols ? Entering the chapel that day with Catherine , I experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , when I had come here before my father 's body had been brought back . For I was looking forward to a physical sign of his death , I wanted a tomb , an indenture in the earth , a sarcophagus , a glimpse of his coffin even , something real , something tangible , something that would knock me over the head with the reality of his death . The chapel offered none of that . It was simply a sea of names engraved from top to bottom of each wall , gold letters on black marble slabs , and the dead were buried below or around it , I did not know which at first . The only change from my last visit was that my father 's name had been added to the left wall , near the entrance , underneath the names of his parents . First came his father 's name : " Mort pour la France , z p 18 . " And then my father 's : " Mort pour la France , 1940 . " " So here we are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be alone ? " " No , no , no , no . " And I wandered about the chapel with the casual air of a museum visitor , whispering the musical names of ancestors commemorated on its walls : " Marie-Laure de Hauterive . . . Clotilde du Maistre . . . ah , yes , Anne-Marie de La Laurencie . . . " Would there never be an end to my cycle of anger , delusion , anger ? He might not be here . He simply might not be anywhere to be found . He might have abandoned me even more totally than I had thought . What a cheat life is , always to be deceiving me that way . I would go , I must go to whatever place his body really lies in , to make absolutely sure , to see the coffin bearing his name . I wanted to break down in the presence of his corpse , to affirm the reality of my grief , top187confirm my sorrow to him and to myself , and here there was nothing but names , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , no one to talk to , and inside me there was an anger that verged on boredom , on void . " So , " I asked Catherine , " where are they ? " " Below , naturally . Actually , if I remember accurately , your father is almost underneath and to the right of the sealing stone , just a few coffins away from the General . As for Papa  --  his oldest brother  --  he is to the left , and their mother is directly above them . Over toward the apse you have the Montmorencys , " she continued , as if seating a dinner party , " the du Maistres , the Saint-Marceaus , the branches of the family that have become a little more distant . You 're sure you do n't want to be alone ? " " No , please stay . What does it look like downstairs ? How are they buried ? " " It 's not unlike the . . . you know , the cubicles in which you check your bags at the railroad station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A long deep recess in the wall into which the coffin is placed lengthwise , with a plaque outside . " " How does one get down there ? " " Right through here . " She gave a familiar pat to a large stone in the floor , just to the right of the entrance . It had a large , rusting metal handle . " Ca n't we go downstairs ? " My voice sounded faint and piping , like that of a child fighting back its tears . " Certainly not , my poor girl , that 's a very complex proposition , " she exclaimed , lifting an arm up toward the sky to indicate a very annoying chapter of family history . " We are never supposed to go down there except in the company of a witness  --  a judge , a clerk of the court , an official of that order . It 's a very difficult business , breaking all that cement around the stone , unsealing it , then lifting it . I know all about it , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get all the wretched jobs . Ten years ago the vault became totally filled and we realizedp188that to be practical we 'd have to do some clearing out , some pruning and weeding if you will . And would n't you know it , I was the one who had to get the stone unsealed and go down into the burial vault with a witness . " She gave a little shudder . " Merde alors , to sais , c'etait tres iznpressionant . It was dark in there , very dark , and . . . Listen , are you sure you do n't want to be alone for a moment ? All right . It was dark , it was not a pleasant task . We had held a family council the night before and decided exactly whom to get rid of . We decided not to stick to chronology , that would have been a bit didactic . We simply got rid of those strains of the family we like the least  --  the Casson , the Du Bourgs , all distant cousins , and there were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We did some selecting , in other words , and put them into the common grave still farther underneath . What else can you do , when you get so crowded ? The whole planet is getting to be that way . Can you imagine what it will be like at resurrection time ? " she added gaily . " Not an inch of elbow room ! What a mess ! " She was twisting and turning her car keys now , eager to go , as if she really had seen quite enough of the place . " I think we 're all right down there for another twenty years or so . But you just wait and see , " she added , throwing the car keys defiantlyinto the air . " If ever it gets filled up again , I 'm the one who 'll end up having to go down there again ! " And with that we drove back to Saint-Seran for tea . On the drive back my husky Charon had the brisk and tender manner of those nurses assigned the midnight shift to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're quite all right , are n't you ? " she would say , giving a reassuring , sideways look . " Would you like a licorice , a comic book ? Ah , I forget , you 're too old for that , in my mind you 're always my little cousin . An aspirin ? I always keep them for the drunks I have to transport to the tribunal . I have n't told you , have I , that Nantes has the highest percentage of alcoholics of any city inp189Europe . Worse than Dublin , can you imagine ? Actually we 're so alike , we and the Irish , all wild Celts . So . Tell me more about America . Did you do your studies in English or in American ? What do you do for your insomnia ? I find Teilhard good at those moments . I hear you do not eat lunch in America . How is that possible ? What do you do all that time , from twelve to two ? Perhaps it 's why you get so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . Does France seem like a very small country in comparison ? " And she said that her oldest sister , Louise , who was waiting for me at Saint-Seran , swore she remembered and loved me like a sister , and had driven from Paris a day ahead of schedule to catch me before I flew back to New York . Alone , alone , I thought , as Catherine 's chatter lulled me like a midnight hypodermic . I must go back there tomorrow alone . Louise was waiting for me at the front door , an enormous woman with the body of the Venus of Lespugue . Having rushed toward me as I got out of her sister 's car , she cupped my face in her hands and stared at me intently , exhaling strong odors of garlic sausage . " After twenty years I would have recognized you from a hundred yards away , " she cried , " from two hundred yards away , do you hear , if I had so much as passed you on a street in Paris ! " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beatifically at her little cousin . She had a round and shiny face , abundant brown hair pulled back in a messy bun , yellowed teeth that went at crazy angles to each other , an expression of great kindness . Her enormous breasts were barely covered by a flimsy printed challis dress . " Well what 's taken you so long ? What 's the idea ? Oh , if you knew what a shining memory we all have of your father ! He was our hero , you know that . What an extraordinary man ! What brilliance ! What charm ! The best-looking man of his generation , on top of everything else !  |p190What  an impression he made on us ! How he stamped our memory ! How indelibly , in-del-ib-ly he marked us all ! How he adored you ! And how you adored him ! Do you remember him well ? " " Very , " I said faintly . " And , of course , you 're one of us down to the tip of your little fingers ! Well , welcome , welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rocking me back and forth like a small baby . Behind her stood a bevy of her children , a new batch of nephews and nieces for me to meet  --  five sons and daughters between the ages of nineteen and twenty-four who had come to spend the week at Saint-Seran . " Yes , how he adored you , how you adored him , " she repeated . " What a pretty couple you made , always hugging and kissing , never separated , he could n't stand to have you out of his sight for five minutes , and you could n't stand to ever let go of his hand . No one else really mattered for you when you were little , is n't that right ? No , I know , no one , no one ! How you must miss him ! " She squeezed me again to her bountiful chest and began to whimper , quite genuinely . The sweet bitch , I thought , when will she stop ? " Poor little Stephanie , " she moaned , " left alone at such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by such an extraordinary parent . How different , how different things would have been if he had not died  --  what a different destiny you would have had ! Even our own destinies might have been changed , too . Do you remember when he took us all to Nantes to see Three Little Pigs ? " " No , I do n't , quite . " " You do n't remember Three Little Pigs ? " she wailed . " But how could you forget ? I was fifteen , Catherine was twelve , you and Daniel were eight . Then do you remember that time he took us all to the circus in Nantes ? " " No , not quite . " " But how can you not remember ? There was this lovelyp191clown you enjoyed so , but when he came toward us and your father said , Do n't you want to shake hands with the clown ? ' you burst into tears and said , No , I ca n't , we have n't been introduced . ' " She laughed uproariously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always such a formal child , always so strictly brought up by that governess . Almost too strictly , I 'd say . A very complex child , that 's for sure , very precise , very sensitive . I remember you used to brush your hair one hundred times in the morning and one hundred times at night even when you were eight years old . You were always our little princess , even though you did n't come back all this time , you 've remained our little princess in America . Oh , my God , I have n't even shown you the photographs of my daughters ' weddings ! Such marvelous weddings ! How could you have stayed away ! " An album was already set upon the table next to us , carefullyprepared for my perusal . " Ah , here 's the wedding of my oldest daughter , Poupette . Yes , how could you have stayed away from such a fine event ? We sent you all our wedding announcements , we all did , for years , and you never responded to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much money , but a very old name , that 's still what counts , after all . And an excellent piece of land in Picardy . The wedding at a private chapel of the bridegroom 's parents ' castle . Not many of us have that anymore , a private chapel ! Four priests officiating . Dominicans . Can you imagine ! Four Dominicans ! Then an orchestra from Amiens played Strauss waltzes . Six attendants in Alencon lace , carrying bouquetsof roses and stephanotis . How could you not have come back to such a splendid wedding ? " " Oh , my little treasure . Hello , my sweetie , sweetie , sweetheart . " Louise 's daughter is already wheeling a baby carriage at the end of a stroll in the park . Aunt Charlotte , my cousin Daniel , Aunt Colette very slowly walk alongside her , makingp192pretty noises at the baby . More celebration of the propagation of protoplasm . Another offspring to revere Saint-Seran , to come back each summer to admire its shuttered windows , its mysteriousand sleeping air . " Oh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Colette is cooing into the carriage . " Do n't you love babies when they 're tiny tiny , when they can almost fit into the palm of your hand ? Look at those teeny teeny hands , those teeny teeny feet . Can you imagine , even de Gaulle once had feet as teeny as those . " The family gathers about the beautiful chipped porcelain . Tea is brought out . Debate rages about the chocolate cake . The recipe has not left the family for two hundred years . " You do not add the egg yolks to it , you only put in the whites , " storms Aunt Charlotte . " I know that our cousins on the Lamoriciere side add the yolks , but that 's a deformation of principle . Yolks make it too heavy , I assure you . " " Maman , I agree about the yolks , " Louise rebuts , " but I do n't agree about the flour . Some of our cousins put in five tablespoons of flour and you do n't put any in , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It needs the binder . " " My sweet sweet dolly , " Aunt Colette continues to purr at the baby , as she may have purred at me in my carriage , " my rabbit , my little treasure ... " One last family picture , outside the pale dwelling bathed in the shimmering Vendee light . Click : here they are , poised for my own slim slice of eternity . Aunt Colette in her watery silks , her tufted face pointed in the direction of the forest , says in her twinkling voice , " We had a glorious stroll this afternoon , the afternoon sunlight is so beautiful today on the stands of elms at the northwest corner of the park . " " Mozambique , " Aunt Charlotte says , pouring tea out of the gilt and crested Empire tea pot , her album of stamps on her lap . " Listen , dear child , you 're going back to America to/morrow , surely you can find me one from Mozambique . And listen , next time you return , there 's more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " So you 're going to go back and give more hell to your President on some other silly puritanical principle , " Daniel roars across the tea table . " Did anyone raise an eyebrow when Napoleon pillaged Egypt ? A little more high-handed authority , that 's what the modern world needs . " Catherine is looking anxiously at her watch , straightening her spectacles , saying , " I really must get back to Nantes by five , there 's a very disturbed child in an alcoholic family ... " I almost do not get there  --  back to the chapel alone . I feel an ambivalence of desire and terror toward that last visit which is more confusing than any emotion I have ever known . Yet I manage to go . I am booked on a one-o'clock plane from Nantes to Paris which connects with a three-o'clock flight back to New York . I hire a car for the morning and set off very early , my bags in the trunk , for Saint-Philbert . I am possessed by one principal fear : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the absence of pain , the same numb hollowness I felt before , the void and boredom that so artfully mask rage . I find my way without difficulty . Turn right at the post office , turn left at the bakery , turn right again at the General two blocks away from the Saint-Philbert cemetery . On the side wall of the bakery is an enormous sign : " Gordon 's Gin . " The General looks fiercer than ever in this morning 's sunny light , his sword rising threateningly above the bands of petunias , forget-menots , geraniums , that grow in impeccable circles about his feet . One more block and I am at the graveyard . I park the car , walk out and take a picture of the cemetery . The ceramic flowers blaze crimson and purple about the gray monument . An albinic light envelops it all . Once inside the chapel I walk up the tiny nave , reach into my pocket for a notebook , and feel driven to take notes on my ancestors ' names . So and sop194and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Isabelle de ' La Varende , such pretty names , names of champagne and musketeers . The notebook is a hedge , a chastity belt , a haven of safety . Stephanie 's the reporter , she always takes notes on whatever comes within her range of sight , she 's seldom moved by the subject matter at hand . Still , they all had insomnia , that 's very touching . Grandfather reading his Taine , Uncle Jean his Michelet , Colette her de Gaulle , my father spending seven years of his white nights authoring a tract on the radical reform of the European economy . He lost the only copy in the back of someone 's car . Whence this anxiety , dear history nuts , whence this agitation ? Here you sleep at last , new friends , sweet insomniacs , here you sleep at last after centuries of turning in your beds ... . A woman in dun-colored dress walks into the chapel , quietly comes up the nave , crosses herself and starts to trim the gladioli and dahlias at the altar with slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , returns to a back pew and sits down . I am still scribbling , scribbling . The gold letters announcethat one of our great-granduncles died in 1838 while directing the French Navy 's assault on Vera Cruz , Mexico ; that the General , after leaving his post in Algeria , was exiled from France for opposing Napoleon III 's Italian campaign , and chose to serve on the other side  --  as head of the Papal troops . Militarists , imperialists , colonialists , just the men I would take part in protest marches against , and yet I am beginning to understand them , to be proud of them . What a good tribe I was born into , defiant , eccentric , pigheaded . Created for violence and romance , for heroism and early death . Nantes  --  the highest percentage of royalists of any city in France , the highest percentage of alcoholics of any city in Europe , perhaps the highest percentage of insomniacs . The Brittany liberation movement is trying to make it the capital of a new independent state . . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pruning shears is praying , that she must be a nun . I hearp195her footsteps retreating , I sense by some slight rustling of her clothes that she is making the sign of the cross as she leaves the chapel . I put my notebook back into my pocket . I do n't quite know what to do next . Now that I am alone again I turn around and walk down the nave toward the back pew . The nuns must come to tenu r flowers every day , there is a heavy but clean scent of roses on the air . Outside the chapel the light is fresh , inviting , bland . Shall I leave now , exit into the sunlight before it happens ? But through some instinct made possible by the rituals of childhood , I kneel down on the sealing stone which stands between me and the dead , the stone I had so desired to break open the day before , the stone that separates his body from mine . I kneel on the stone , scratching shyly at the cement that seals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands of cement that intersect the gray flagstones of the chapel floor , but it is slightly darker , different in texture . There is some difference , some difference that makes me keep on scratching , scratching , to make sure that it is indeed as immutable as Catherine said , to make sure that I can not break through it . And then suddenly my liberation comes . I am free now , kneelingon the stone , suddenly free and shaking , my head resting against the rusty metal handle that could be lifted for our reunion . I weep , I shake , I pound at the floor with my head , I kick it , I beat it with my hands . I feel no unease or shame at my behavior , I know that society is sick for forbidding us such liberations any more , for obstructing the channels of our grief , for not letting us properly mourn the dead . I know that I am inconquerably sane and that society is mad . I lie prone on the floor for a half hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head aching from hitting it against the stone , my jeans drenched as if I had sailed a boat into a storm . Yet I do not feel any more rage . Nor do I feel void , or fear . I am ready to die , but not now , not in a violent or untimely way , I simply have no more fear of dying , I want to die the wayp196I want to live , I have conquered some fear of both . I am crying my heart out , free at last . He is there , he is there , he is there . I finally know that he is there , down below . But that is not the point . He is both there and not there . Above all else he is now allowed to live in my memory , totally restored and whole now , as if resurrected , the reality of his death accepted , faced . After some time I begin to raise myself up to my knees . I have no more need to hammer at the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last . May he rest in peace . May he sleep at last . As I start to get up I see that a plaque above my head , a few feet away , commemorates one Julie de Lamoriciere , wife of that martial conqueror whose remains were so voraciously preserved by his admirers . It says : Julie-Amelie d'Abeslard de Lamoriciere Died in Paris the 26th of April 1885Her body reposes hereNext to that of her husband and her children Awaiting the resurrection . Think of that.  |p199All  that is temporall is but a caterpillar got into a corner of my garden , but a milldeww fallen upon one acre of my Corne. - JOHN DONNEA winter weekend in Atlantic City , that was Paul 's idea of a nice way to spend New Year 's Eve . He said it would remind him of his childhood , he was dying to go back . We booked a room in what he remembered to have been the grandest hotel there . But the suites he 'd stayed in as a child had been closed for decades , we were relegated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubicles in which I mostly remember piss-stained rugs , rusting yellow bathtubs . I sat in bed much of the weekend reading George Eliot and thinking , Why am I here , swigging from a miniature whiskey bottle the evenings he wanted to make love , so that I could do it better , make him happy . On the way to dinner we passed through the hotel 's large abandoneddrawing rooms , whose peeling walls resembled thirddegreeburns , maps of the moon . Paul passed under a crackedp200chandelier and said that he remembered walking through that very room holding his mother 's hand on New Year 's Eve . " And she whispered , It 's going to be 1930 tomorrow ! ' " I knew the details of that euphoric memory without asking : her perfume , his childhood , the gleam of her newly acquired jewelry and furs . I on my part was thinking of what good radicals unlike us , good radical Jews , used to do in resort hotels in the nineteen-twenties . When the management had been rude to one of their people dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , closing the door , leaving the taps to run . Perhaps that 's how our room had been messed up  --  that was one consolation of the weekend  --  perhaps some offendedJews might have turned on the bathtub taps and silently left town . That New Year 's Eve we went to small restaurants in the neighborhood , we mostly talked about our children , I loved him , I drank my boredom down . The next day in the abysmal cold of daylight we strolled on the boardwalk , sleazy now with bowling alleys , cheap clothing stores , taffy candy shops , more decaying hotels . Filled also with old people in wheelchairs from neighboring rest homes , people who did not have his deathly desire to turn time back , who simply wanted a few more scraps of sky to glimpse . " In the old days one could rent a wheelchair and a blanket , " he said , " and an attendant would push you up and down the boardwalk , whatever age you were . " My husband was more silent than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this slice of his beloved past . The old days , the old days , that 's what he talked about often when we traveled . What a decline in the quality of resorts , of art criticism , of political ethics , he said that weekend , what a decline in the quality of human values . In the old days he could buy lovely fresh fish for his dogs at seventeen cents a pound , help was easier to get , what a good life Renoir must have had . And there were all those things he said with his eyes only , which he never spoke audibly : in the old days children stayed with their parents until they married ,  |p201whether  at the age of twenty-nine or forty-five , in the old days women were predictable and docile or else they were stoned , maybe to death . We both have insomnia , his is more acute than mine , it was worse than ever that weekend . I take light pills for it , he does not , he says he is already depressed enough without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost every day when we 're home the house is hushed , hushed while Daddy is napping . In the first years of our marriage when we could not sleep we made hot Ovaltine in the middle of the night , played chess or backgammon , now we are too fragile for that , even on vacations such as this our light sleeps rustle next to each other like animals panting on a hot night . Every New Year 's Day as I try to fall asleep I recall the seasons of the preceding year , the rumble of the snow plow slicing through the first great January storm , the late muddy winter , the fetid smell of dead animals suddenly surging under the melting snow , the swollen streams , the glossy , lemon-yellow willow buds . Summer , our children growing , the sweetness of their naked bodies , the triumphantsplash of their urine against the large oak behind the pond . On a fall day when the trees ooze colors like syrup , I have often thought that on such a day when my beloved childrenare grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , driving my car into a copse of crimson maples to the strain of my sweet radio jazz . But one must wait , one must wait until the birds are grown . Nurturing , nurturing , that is our beginning and our end . In a December storm I love to see our little boy standing immobile in the snow , arms stretched out as he watches the silent flakes settle on his hand , on the dog 's long fleece , on the stippled birches . We are punctilious parents . The tree is bought before anyone else 's , the carols are learned and the creche is in order two weeks before Christmas . Thin high voices soaring . Ces voix d'enfants , chantant clans les coupoles . I want everything to be a precise opposite of my own lonely childhood . Theirs will be all laughter and companionshipand normalcy , I fear to leave them for more thanp202a day , we are the prize-winning little nuclear family , oh what a show of unity , we never quarrel before them , we never quarrelbehind them , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we are insomniacs . When I go to bed on New Year 's night I wind my watch , thinking , If I have to turn it less than twenty times before it locks I 'm going to have another affair before the summer . But by the time it locks I 'm so slowed by Nembutal I 've forgotten whether under twenty or over meant trouble . So that 's that . After a few years of seeking shelter in marriage , before I started writing , teaching , seeing other men again , I pondered a great deal on death while gardening . I detestgardening , I did it out of docility , the way I froze forty quarts of beans in summertime , to satisfy Paul 's expectations of me . I worried about my potential for suicide ; spading up the earth of his flower borders , I kept seeing my death in the face of the peony , in the pistil of the lupine , there was a great emptiness , a great terror glimpsed through the fissure of this calm act . I grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Madame Butterfly snapdragons , Giant Pacific delphiniums , I saw destruction in the face of each flower . Every spring , stomp , stomp , my naked feet wallowed into the sumptuousfreshly furrowed earth , pressing down the seeds of snow peas , bib lettuce , fennel , Hubbard squash , there was that funny day the first summer of our marriage when a friend from Paris came for lunch in a chauffeur-driven limousine , one of those dashing magnates my mother used to thrust upon me in hope of getting me well married early . We gave him a simple lunch , buttermilk soup , lots of cucumbers from the garden , he left with a puzzled expression on his face , the new me stomping about the vegetable patch must have seemed very odd compared to the doll in borrowed Chanels wandering through nightclubs in search of love . Yet within a few years I knew I would rather die brutally , prematurely , than lead the life my husband would have preferred for me , he would have liked me to garden more , bake more bread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrations . Puppy , puppy love , he used to call me in the first years when I fulfilled his image of happiness the way he at first fulfilled mine . And I called him Father Earth because along with his work and his family he loved his property , his garden , his home beyond all else , he was always so sweet and eager to help me out . " Stephaniedarling , where 's that silver serving spoon my mother gave us , we 're already losing our wedding gifts , it 's incredible , I ca n't ever find anything . . . . The garden is n't weeded , sweetie pie , you 're losing all that lovely lettuce .... Would you like me to make some nice curry for dinner , there 's all that lamb left over from the weekend going to waste , and I could add some of our own zucchini . . . . " We go to PTA meetings . We have breakfast , lunch and dinner together every day . Our parents spend all the holidays with us . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christmas party last week a Radcliffe classmateasked me what kind of life I had , I said the year after I came back from Paris I married a successful architect whom I 'd known for years , we own a nineteenth-century house and forty acres of land in Massachusetts , my husband is the original Mr. Marriage , my marriage is so solid and substantial it could be made of kosher chicken livers . Yet the funny thing is , I continued , I have these recurring dreams that I 'm a middle-aged spinster pining for a family and a home , is n't that hysterical ? The liberation movements of our time give most of us a profoundlyambivalent attitude toward permanence , she said , to which I replied , Are n't women great , I would never have thought of that all by myself . On that New Year 's night in Atlantic City I dream again that I am middle-aged and unmarried , homeless , with nowhere to sleep but the steps of a primitive Mayan shrine on which I have been waiting eight years for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut short as if for surgery . I am hungry , lonely , where is the bridegroom ? Finally he advances , holding an executioner 's ax . He neatly decapitates me , I am metamorphosed into a casualp204observer , as the former me becomes a human sacrifice , my former head rolls down the steps of the altar in a pool of nectar . The power with which the human male for the first time overwhelmed the human female marked the end of woman 's ability to choose . . . the primal rape was a phallic , sadistic act.  --  Gregory ZillborgRain beating down , sheets of water sloughing up against the black windowpane , the car cutting through the sheets of rain like a surgeon continuously sopping up the blood that spouts from his incision . Whatever the weather , he drives a car the way he provides for his family , with utmost silence , resoluteness , assurance of his worth , occasionally giving me a sweet , paternal smile . Until a few years ago I hated his silence , I resentedit , I remember writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Our silence swells , " " Our silence lies between us like a heap of garbage . " I resented the boredom and the muteness , it reminded me of the wordlessness with which my mother had stifled my childhood . But lately , tonight for instance , our vacuum has taken on a quality of refuge , almost of pleasure , it is my way of remaining separate now that I have lost that sloppy romantic desire to merge . " Being part is an exertion that declines , " that 's Wallace Stevens , I think , I do not want anyone to drag me down now that I am finally raising myself up , up . Nights like this when we drive home through the Massachusetts countryside , that 's when the silence is most satisfying , especially if I 'm a little stoned , then riding through the black rain is like being born into the night , borne , born through tunneled darkness on great waves of amniotic fluid . I particularly like to get stoned when driving home in the dark like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , play inside it all by myself . In this car similar to the silent living roomsp205of my childhood the same loneliness prevails , the darkness is full of ghosts to be charmed and exorcised by games and word tricks so it can become as tender as the licking of an enormous black tongue . Tonight for instance I think of death and the afterlife , my last lecture on John Donne , the influence of alchemyon Donne 's notion of the resurrection of the body  --  the alchemical ruining of the body effected by a quintessence of privation , of nothingness , is necessary to the glory of the resurrection , what a thought  --  and I think of some event in one of my children 's lives that I am telling friends about , and about two or three students in freshman English who need an extra tutorial , and of how I 'd like to be alone more , be able to disappearfor a month , yet remain still loved ( will that ever becomepossible , this marriage is so big and kosher it 's like a government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense , our Health , Education and Welfare ) , and I think of how I need another glass of wine to better survive the silence of this drive , about how I have n't felt like fucking anyone for months , and I wonder why I do n't masturbate the way other women say they do and whether they 're putting us on with their talk of how often they jack off  --  jack off , funny words for us , but the proper terms for our bodies do n't exist yet , so we have to borrow them from men for the time being , go in drag as it were , drag our way through their language until we forge our own  --  and just think , I did it for the first time only last year , in my thirties , on a day when I had a bad cold and was reading in bed thinking about Claire , thinking of how beautiful she had been at that last peace demonstration when I lay on the grass with my head on her lap , and she stroked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me , " You look like a swan , you have the heart of a lion , " that 's what I like most about love , the unclouding of the mirror of self , very narcissistic but what can you do , it 's true , and it 's what I miss the most in this marriage , I 'm never told what I am , never given a mirror , because that needs language and he seldom dares to talk about us , that would be taking off his mask ,  |p206words  are shit , he once said , and we never discussed it again  --  anyhow , thinking of Claire , I tried it , and it brought only the gentlest sensation , pathetic compared to the real thing , no more than a little sigh , a tiny puff of pleasure , like seeing the Parthenonfor the first time after having heard about it all one 's life and finding it to be a pretty little building thirty feet long , and yet it did offer a resolution , the fantasy was abated by rubbing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that bedroom which I painted dark green years ago , green for the repose , the refuge , the shelter marriage provided for me , it has become like a childhood room because I spent the childhoodof my marriage there and I have changed so much since then , and here I was jacking off next to those dolls my father gave me a few years before he died , the beautiful nineteenthcenturywax dolls with the blond curls and satins and laces and gilt ribbons whose glass domes I have never dared remove because I was afraid they would crumble at my touch , there they were looking at me like kind nurses as I felt the lovely little warm rush in my groin ... and come to think of it I 've got to do something about this silent man I love sitting at my side , I 'm fed up with all our excuses about backaches and insomniasand headaches , last Tuesday we 'd been married fourteenyears and when we came home I thought , Anniversary , it ca n't go on this way , we 've fucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale anxiety in his eyes , this is what I hate most about marriage , the chattelizing , the obligation , the damn duty , duty  --  duty really is his bag , he 's into duty the way others are into grass , duty to me , to his parents to his genitals to his mouth , God how miserable he looks when a meal or a fuck is n't on time , that 's what an orderly life is about I suppose  --  anyhow although he 's the best lover I 've ever had I ca n't stand being merged , fused , entered right now , so I said , " Can I do it for you ? " and he said , " Yes ! that 's what I like the best anyway , " and I started stroking him , but my arm got tired , I could n't get the variety of speed he needed to get off , I got bored and lazy and said , " Do it yourself please a little whilep207and tell me when you 're close to coming so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pumped it himself I was struck by his beauty , the elegance of that head framed by thick wavy barely graying hair , the youthfulness of his long body , the beauty of that penis , as alabaster fresh and brawny as if he were eighteen , he pumped it mightily , but it was too late , my fault , we were both tired and had had a lot of wine , I 'd already taken my sleeping pill , we turned over and hugged each other and said , " What an anniversary , thank God that only happens once a year , " and I fell asleep .... The rain beating , the car slicing through the sheet of black water and silence .... This is what I think about a lot in these dark night drives , how to fuck , how to fuck better , how to fuck several men at the same time , how many cocks could you fit in all at once , and how things look , how bodies look in various positions , for instance when he is over me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our green bedroom-caveis circumscribed by the hulk of his buttocks , by his golden-blond ass as palely fuzzed as the landscape at my favoritetime of year , at that dawn of spring when the growth is not any color yet but a pale gloss , an evanescence  --  to stare at the horizon of those buttocks is also like staring eye level at a gigantic apple , at the beautiful cleft in the middle of the fruit from which thrusts the upright stem  --  the golden spring landscapefalls and rises , falls and rises over my head , almost strangling me , obscuring all else in the room except a speck of green ceiling , nothing but the lovely apple-hill rising and falling like a breathing mountain over me . . . when we turn over and do it sideways I get the full beauty of his cock near my eyes and it becomes metamorphosed into the face of a sad , wise man , it has a character , it has an expression , it is the face of a terribly wise ironic man with the beauty of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the long narrow face , the lips way below at the fold curled into an ironic smile , the face of a mystic contemplating the irony of creation  --  and this is what I think about often when I ride home in the dark , how I have loved his cock and that of other men , how the bestp208fucks have been with him or else the times when I 've fucked two men on the same day , there 's an amplitude there , a thrill at the thought of two identities of sperm mixing a few hours apart , how glorious it would be to treat ourselves to six , seven men in a row , to have a constellation of semens twirling about in each of us , but we women have not been allowed that for the past ten thousand years or so , we the dispossessed , we who were disenthroned so that men could inherit the vile stuff of property , we who can reach it without trouble twenty-seven times in a row , we whose gigantic needs were suppressed to make this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out our sexuality in fantasy , in dream , in religion .. . and this is what he will never understand , this is how men have enslaved us , precisely by looking at our bodies as objects of worth , I have not any awe for my body neither do I wish him to have any , what is my body but an impoverished appendage of my spirit , Buddhism , the whole East is beginning to bring that home to us , I think it was John Donne who called it " a bracelet of bright hair about the bone , " what is the body but a modest hostel to be cleansed , enjoyed and shared with increasinglysimple , austere , communal ways of housekeeping .. . and whoever looks on it differently , with possessiveness or uniqueness , debases us to chattel , keeps us as morbidly encased as those wax dolls under glass that stand in my bedroom . . . the dark night flows , flows about us , he drives on silently , I am always alone .

He hums along with the cassette of Handel 's Messiahp209we are playing on the little tape recorder I keep in my shoppingbag . We play Bach , Vivaldi masses , mostly religious music . " I need either a brothel or a conversion  --  the two interchangeable  --  " I 've been writing something like that in my journal every few months for years .

As the affair drags on , my fear of his boredom centers not on my flat chest or our waning repertory of novel positions but on how weary he must be of staring at that same canvas shopping bag , it must be as boring as his wife 's nightgowns , why has n't Vogue mentioned this aspect of the seduction business ?

That 's what love is about . Think about that . He sat in the vast courtyard lit by April sunshine , a man in early middle age nursing his dying dog . He had taken one of the ladderback chairs out of the dining room and sat over the animal , his hand soothing the old spaniel 's chest , straining to let her live as long as possible into the sunny morning . The chair he sat on was of maple , its caning as rumpled and mangy as the dog 's russet fur . They had lived together in the intimacy that only the most silent men can offer their animals . The spaniel lay on the same spot where she had lain for many yearsp212and had bared her fangs at anyone who disturbed her master 's peace .

Does it , Mom , does it ? " There outside was his father , a man who loves us as deeply as he hates words , a man who dislikes much of the world about him , a man often tired , difficult to live with . I walked toward him and put a hand on his shoulder . A tear rolled down his furrowed cheek . His eyes are pale blue , both tender and severe , when I describe them to myself I often refer to them as " judgmental . " My husband has judgmental eyes .

He was handsome as a movie star , everyone said he resembled Jimmy Stewart . I kept wondering why no one had grabbed him yet , what was wrong with him that no one had yet stolen him from his mother , she dominated the house , her whines of worry about china , pearls , silver , the winterizing of her furs , hummed through their rooms like ultrasonic beams . For years I 'd wonderedhow he managed without women , living like that in New England , seldom going anywhere except to look at some new architectural site , just designing those buildings and reading and gardening and taking care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was wrong with him that he sought suchp213refuge in the past , that he did not love today and grab it more . One day after I 'd returned from that crazy year of being twenty-three in Paris , his parents went on a trip and we made love again in his house , briefly and simply , nothing extraordinarythat time . I wanted to marry Paul because I needed his growing tenderness , his need of me , his frequent and protective smile , those fireplaces , I suddenly wanted to have his children , I wanted to bring up his children in that house . That 's love . His parents eventually moved out and took a flat in Boston , after much difficulty . In the first years of our marriage we often discussed the following question with great seriousness : who had left us a more spectacular mess , his devouring whining mother or my devouring vociferous one ? We mended each other piece by piece , ever so patiently , as if we were wounded animals or anemic children , in those early days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our I-love-you 's were coming out like the ticking of a clock . He even talked me into some of that bourgeois finery I 'd always detested , china , monogrammed towels , a little silver even , it seemed to reassure him , it gave him a sense of permanence , his mother 's sense of material permanence . I sorted his socks , I made blackberry jam , I hung his Harvard summa-cum degree over his desk , I spent five hours making one pate en croute , I did little else , I was a blast , I was a housewife . Goddammit , this was the fifties . I waited for him at lunch every day , I set his place at the kitchen table with the new silver , waiting for him to return from his drafting board , looking forward to seeing his fine hair curl over his strong neck , to his smell of dark ink and lemon soap . Dammit , how much fairer to him if we had brought each other up in the seventies , and I 'd be a lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going away to monthly conventions , how much easier life would be for him now . In the beginning , we sometimes drank a bit at night , and cried at the thought of each other 's death . I also wept when I learned that I was pregnant , after two years of constantly trying . " We 're neverp214going to be alone anymore , " I sobbed , and the three dogs licked me as I stood by the fireplace weeping at that thought . When I had first slept with him years ago I discovered that the dogs were inseparable from him , an extension of his body and of his chosen loneliness , sleeping on top of his bed , on top of his clothes . He protected himself with those dogs the way he protected himself from the century with his sad parents , his property , his compulsive ten-hour-a-day working schedules , his dull , mournful country acquaintances : rich Wasp country gentry , two decades older than he most of them , with whom he could decry the loss of human values , talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his contemporaries , the few artists or writers he saw were older men who he felt had been left behind by the stream of history , he was always singing their praises over those of the young twerps who had made it . A man perfectly sexed with no society of his own , only one or two friends in the world , he reminded me of a splendid but unidentifiable tree in a forest of birches , or a beautiful unidentifiable forest animal . Perhaps that 's why I 'm still unable to put together the pieces of his character , the picture-puzzle pieces are still jumbled in the brown paper bag , little details of the design come out , like here 's the well , here 's the kitty cat  --  he is brilliant , loyal , loving , secretive , self-righteous  --  buteven after all these years I ca n't make out much more than that , I 'm left ignorant of the larger landscape , maybe that 's why I 'm still in love with him , he 's so mysterious . The evening I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I had gone out for a walk alone and stared at the brilliance of the trees hanging over his country road and thought , That 's it , my life is settled , all is in order now , I shall have order at last , order order order , none of Louis B. 's or my parents ' brilliant disorder , I shall have that quiet country life of Paul 's which my friends warned me would drive me crazy  --  something more on the order of SaintSeran  --  lotsof dogs , a country gentleman for a husband , meals on time . Somehow I had always imagined it occurring in En/gland rather than in America , I 'd once had an English boy friend who called me Poppy , I 'd imagined a household like those photographed in Country Life magazine , Sir and Lady So-and-So are shown here with their German shepherds and their two delightful children , Sebastian and Bartholomew . A bookish , donnish man with a little title and an unused degree in theology from Cambridge with whom I could discuss the influenceof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have made it perfect for my mother and me . " What was the theory of afterlife among the metaphysicals of Cromwell 's time ? " I could have asked him as I pruned the rosebushes , and he would have replied , " Well , Poppy dear , one could say it is exemplified by that poem of Donne 's in which he refers to the body as a bracelet of bright hair about the bone , ' a quite fundamentalistview actually , very obsessed by the resurrection of the body with considerable stress on the Transfiguration .... " But notwithstanding his summa-cums , the man I married prefersto stand about the lawn in his pajamas , volume of Proust in hand , talking to his dogs , saying , " Do your peepee , Sahara , do your peepee , darling , that 's a good girl , ouisee ouisee , that 's a good puppy . " " Words are crap , " he had once said . We live on in considerable calm and silence . Like most others we were at our happiest when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lives around our babies , like that time we went to Spain with those elegant , gay American expatriates . It was just like that summer in Saint-Tropez , after a few weeks we barely talked to our chic friends or relatives , we relished only our purring peace , we stayed in our little room most of the time playing with baby , the mattress was set on the floor to aid Paul 's ailing back , Tommy was eight months old and beginning to sit up and ask for things , we could watch him bouncing on the mattress for hours on end going , " Whee , whee . " Paul was always the exemplary father and husband , up early doing the first bottle and diaper shifts , taking pride in whatever little bouts of writing I could get done , poring overp216my Master 's thesis for hours , penciling all my papers and articles so meticulously , always so helpful , never complaining , those are the most difficult men , the ones who make you feel grateful for so much . That time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Madrid , leaving Tommy in the country with a sitter , what a major expedition that was for us . I was already pregnant with a second child , with Jeffie . We walked too long in the Prado visiting those paintings we both love , the HieronymusBosches , the Grecos , the late dark Goyas in the museum 's basement , art is something he can always be eloquent about , especially about the use of materials , the formal design . We had a lot of wine with lunch and made love afterward , that evening we were terribly worried about the baby inside me . " You 're going to have another baby , " he said as we rode back on the train . " I must buy you a fur coat , you 've never had a decent winter coat . " Respectable mothers must have a fur coat , the silver must be kept polished . A protective , tender hug , a flash of the movie-star smile that shields his identity like a mask . I said I could n't stand fur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You must have a warm , decent winter coat . " He brushed back my hair with so much tenderness that serenity and fulfillment flowed mightily through me , those were sweet days , sweet days . Marriage like the Sea of Azov ! When I used to study geographywith my Russian governess that was where I wanted to go more than anywhere else in the world , the Sea of Azov . I like the calm , the platitude , the intimacy it implied . Azov , that 's the way marriage is with a man who paces his life and others ' according to certain ineluctable principles : Respectable women own a string of pearls . New York at night is dangerous . Stay away from philandering men . Confucian devotion to parents . The perfect wife is the Indian goddess with thirty-seven arms who spends her summers taking the children swimming , driving the children and their friends all over the map , entertaining herp217husband 's clients , getting an hour 's work done on her own manuscript before cooking a meal for twelve , grooming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable patch so the deer wo n't get at it , writing letters to newspapers about political prisoners in Chile , raising funds for war resisters .. . Mother earth , I love you best as Mother Earth , his eyes are most often saying or else they say , Be patient , everything has its place . Ah , yes , place . At times I try to sit on his side of the kitchen table , I adore a change of view . But he takes that poorly , he takes it as a revolt . He moves my plate and spoon out and puts his plate and spoon back in their usual position , he insists on keeping the same place year after year , at the south side of the kitchen table overlooking the lawn in which he buried his last spaniel . Well , I could have said it along with Sigmund , order is a compulsion to repeat which " spares indecision and hesitation , " or something like that , anyhow it 's another tactic to avoid anxiety . I 'd wanted order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this table , civilization and its discontents right along with our Grape-Nuts . There are times when I walk into the house and the calm , orderly anguish of Paul 's life is summed up by the sound of his chewing . He is a lean man who loves his food , who looks anxious at parties when food does not arrive on time , not because he is truly hungry but because conversation bores him and food reassures him , and he wants to fall into bed as soon as possible to return to his books and his attempts at sleep . And sometimes when I walk into the house I am surrounded by the crisp angry sound of his chewingon something dry and brittle  --  toast mostly , toast or crackers  --  asound like that of an army of squirrels fervidly chewing . Being of an elegant and delicate nature , he will not vent his anxiety on meat or rich matter , only on austere thin dry objects , wafers , toast . And over the years the sight of his chewing obsesses me as the symbol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peers , his colleagues , from everything except his family and land  --  oh yes God , that familyp218and land which give him all the roots he has . It is like the chewingof one of those squirrels one sometimes observes in a forest , separated from their tribe , standing with a worried look in their eyes but munching vigorously on their twigs , as if the working of their jaws was the best protection against the fullness of their solitude . And as I foray into his den , that unshakable north seat of the kitchen table , the pale , worried blue eyes seem to conveythe following message over the indomitably moving mandibles : " These are frightening times . I believe in human dignity , private enterprise and the sacredness of marriage . I know that you chafe a bit in this calm life of ours , but I demand your loyalty and patience . We married because a time came when you seemed as afraid of solitude as I was , and when you leave me for even two days I get intensely depressed , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression . I can lean against the icebox and faint again the way I used to in Paris , I shall give you considerable freedom from criticism in order to avoid that blackmail or the bargaining for truths about our pasts . So let us live on as serenely as we have lived for the past many years , let us never shift the breakfast dishes at this table . . . . " Meanwhile my own eyes are saying something like this over his genuine hewn-pine kitchen table : " Threatening blackmail , preserving the sanctity of home and of ancient rules , just like a woman ! What a decade , now we 're the ones who want adventure , independence , transiency , a new place to sit at . . . . " His own eyes are very beautiful , pale eyes filled with the self-righteousness of his beliefs , standing like cold lakes in the fine , chiseled face . They dominate that portrait of him someone did when he was in his twenties , a terrifying painting that hangs in the hall by his study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of some New England divine willing to ostracize those who differ from his beliefs . Over the years as I become more playful , freer , I salute it increasingly often as I saunter down the corridor . " Hi , Cromwell dear , " I say , or " Good morning , Oliver , " " Oliver , dear prig , how'sp219business today ? " It 's another little magic trick to soothe the loneliness , to survive . For even those times when we take our evening strolls there is terror in the blue eyes of my shelterer if I think of a line of poetry and start walking a little ahead of him ( he likes to walk up the same road every night with a little military step , his arm tenderly around my shoulder ) . " Why are you walking ahead of me ? " he barks , tugging at me sharply from behind , back into history , into subjugation . " Do n't walk ahead of me like that ! " It 's like Vietnam , or the Mayaguez , they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fucker , " I say , " I do n't give a shit when you walk ahead of me , " but I say it inaudibly , most of our anger lies unsaid , we spit it out in the pantomime of our eyes , and when pulled back like that , smile women smile , the way a prisoner smiles at his guard , hoping for a better deal next time around . Often he calls me by his doggie 's name by mistake , " Come here , Sahara darling , here , sweetheart , come on , puppy love , " how many men must wish we were like that , staring longingly at them through the window , saluting them with bounces after a few hours ' absence as if they 'd been gone for days . WITCHCRAFT / WITTGENSTEIN , Ludwig / WLADYSLAW 17 , Jogi / WOHLER , Friedrich / WOMEN , Status of / WOOD and Wood Products  --  Encyclopaedia Britannica , 1974 ed . If I were ever to go mad it would be on Thanksgiving Day , that day of guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ax over a sacrificial victim , like the oven 's heat on that poor bird . What a perfect day to go loony . In comes the turkey and out I go , borne on a stretcher into the cold maternal night , smashing all that crystal and china of theirs , howling , " Libera/tion from this shit ! Freedom ! " " Eat your turkey , darling , " Gwammy says , " Eat the lovely turkey Gwammy and Mommy cooked for you . " " What 's that funny dress you 're wearing Gwarnmy ? " Tommy says . " That 's called a kimono , " Gwammy says , " your Daddy brought it back to me from Korea , he alwaysused to bring me such nice things in the old days . " Jeffie wants to know how Gwammy likes the stuffing . Gwammy says , " Hmmmmm , it 's not too bad , but I prefer the bread-andcreamkind I used to make for Daddy when we lived in Westchester , you remember dear how I used to make it in Purchase , cream-and-cornbread stuffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother , " he says , " I do n't mind her apricots at all . " ( This is what I dreamed of all through high school , when we had no dining room and I ate off cupboards , standing up , I dreamed of sitting down for Thanksgiving dinner in candlelight , of meals on time . ) Tommy wants to know whether Dad has heard about Billie Jean King 's press conference . " Sure I 've read about Billie Jean , what 's she trying to prove , that she 's just as strong as any man ? " Tommy says that 's not what she wants to prove , she 's just saying that women are underpaid . And Mommy says she made it perfectly clear that that 's what she 's talking about . Daddy says , " Nonsense , that women 's lib movement is always trying to prove that they can do anything as well as men . " " That is not what the feminist athletes are trying to prove ( stay with my college podium jargon , keep my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be improved to a degree if societal attitudes . . . " " I hate hate hate that women 's lib , " Gwammy says , " I hate everything they do , everything they say . " Poor sweethearts , how they always side together on the lib business , how they miss the good old days when there was better weather , better ice cream , docile women . Last night I had another funny dream , that I was longing for a man whose mother had locked him in her room , I found the way to his bedroom and she was there at the door , saying his name was Ockham but I must n't touch him because he is too frail , hep221would crumble into dust at the slightest touch . Ockham , Williamof , razor 's edge , I manage to pursue him down a long , steeply curving staircase which transforms itself into a water chute , a steep down-winding stream . He hangs on to the staircase , he escapes me , but I have a good time alone in that scene of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chute as unctuously as a puppy slithers out of the tomb , oops I meanwomb , that 's the way I said it to my shrink and he was fascinated by the slip  --  tomb , womb . ( So he 's not born yet ? Still hanging on to the Cord , in your opinion ? Maybe it 's strangling him ? ) Almost every night I have similar dreams  --  I am unmarried , unloved , have nowhere to live . Then I wake up and find that I am still young and beautiful , that I have two perfect children , a brilliant and adoring husband , that I am saddled with the matter of affection . What do they mean ? " Remember those lovely little carts with white awnings the Negroes used to pull us in when we went to Florida , " Gwammy is saying , " they were so comfortable , those good old days are gone ... . Remember how well the clematis grew right on our terrace in Westchester , just a little handful of bone meal at the roots and it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen 's in terrible shape , you should go to the July white sales at Altman 's , that 's where we used to go for our linen , you remember . . . . " She loves to rub in the memories of that past of theirs which he wears like a scar , and almost every Thanksgiving Paul 's back corset makes funny little bulges under his shirt , upon arriving at her flat for the weekend he is inevitably stricken with some ailment , usually his back . It is the subtlest proof of his distaste for the visit and of his determination to suffer through it , they must have had pains together the way some couples have children . " How did you sleep last night , Mother ? " " Oh terrible , I took a Tuinal at two A.m . " " I did even worse , barely three hours of sleep . " " I woke up with the funniest pain in my wrist . " " Well , I should tell you my ankle is really killing me . " This apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a funereal bird 's cage ,  |p222with  its hair-parlor Louis XV decor , bisque statuary , tragic cousins in graduation pictures , custom-made lace tablecloths brought to the house in little suitcases by Mr. Rozensweig , gilt-framed photographs of loved ones mostly dead . Paul 's father , dead of liver troubles and intemperate diet two years after our marriage ; Paul 's older brother , killed in his thirties in a homosexual crime of passion ; Paul 's younger brother , dead in his thirties of a stroke induced by drugs after ten years of massive analysis . ( " Death at an early age ? " That 's what I try to have my eyes say in our inimitable dumb show when he 's bugging me with his solid old values : " Death at an early age , is that what you want for us too ? " ) And then pictures of Paul still alive , so different , so composed and disciplined , his fine angular beauty so unlike the rest of his thick-limbed , thicklippedfamily that he seems to have fathered and mothered himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for life . Every Thanksgiving when I stare at those baby pictures of my husband , that 's when I decipher a bit more of him , when the landscape beyond the rosebush and the well begins to crystallize like the image in a Polaroid shot : Perpetualguilt , that guilt the shrewdest mothers of the species know how to instill into their sons for ever leaving them at all . Perpetual need for tribe ; and since he had always hated his aunts and cousins and brothers , found them coarse and vulgar , his tribal loyalty had all devolved upon this lovely blond mother whose mind is exclusively furnished with crystal , silver , furs , children , and ailments . Ah , yes , maybe that 's what you 're most afraid of , my beloved squirrel with the anxious eyes , afraid of being left without either a mommy or a wifey .... There were days after one particular affair when I reached for a Bufferin in the early morning and swallowed a Seconal instead by mistake , following it with an emetic to throw it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reds in the A.M. like in Paris and Switzerland , we 've come right back to where we started . I am unfaithful because I am lonely , because I want to be a boy ,  |p223because  I want to be punished , because I desire to desire my husband again , because I want to know who he is , because I am starved for transcendence , because I rebel for all women , because we are killing each other in our dolls ' houses , because . . . The night he learned about that one he confronted me with the face in the portrait , the paleness of his eyes blazing like ice in the moonlight , he said never again , I want those children , things like that . He left for two days and I slept druglessly those nights for the first time in years , as if I had brought my life to some needed resolution , and the next morning I desired him again for the first time in years with the full force of those early days . How we made love after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never wanted you as much as the time I hurt you the most , because it was the only time you let the being caged inside you rage , the only time I fully grasped you as a person , the only time you were about to kill me , the only time you really talked to me , the only time the reality of your manhood overcame the sheltering stranger who sits at the other end of the Thanksgiving table talking about our children , our mothers , our property , our dogs , our recipes for spinach . Last night after the birth-in-water dream I had still another dream that I was growing older and lonelier , that I sorrowed for never having married : My bedroom has a huge glass wall overlooking a pool through which I see a beautiful blond child swimming , one of those Park Avenue nymphets like Janet who made me miserable at Miss Temple 's . During a ten-second swim she metamorphoses into a woman , she sprouts breasts and pubic hair , a large screen over the pool flashes an announcement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not invited and at which I stare again through a glass wall , the perpetual outsider . . . . A wedding dance , maids of honor with gardenias in their hair .... The pool metamorphoses into a frozen pond ( marriage as a freezing of the impulses , as sleep and death ? ) . . . Everyone is skating , dressed in white ermine muffs , long white fur dresses . Myp224mother stands beside me , singling out a tall silvery stranger as a marriage partner , saying , " You 're married to Paul , but it does n't count , it 's not enough , you must have another one . " Claire , my dearest mentor , if only she were here today , with her I could discuss this dream or anything else , God , Kafka , the resurrection of the body , instead I 'll drink on , I 'll drink to her , I 'll drink to remember and forget . To remember that day last month I spent in jail in the cell next to hers , watched by slender matrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about death , the Rosenbergs ' innocence , the meaning of Kafka 's Metamorphosis . " Hypocrite lectrice , ma semblable , ma soeur , what does Metamorphosis mean to you , " I asked her , " is Gregor Samsa a symbol of original sin ? Or of the resurrectionof the body ? Or is he a symbolic victim of our parents ' sloth and selfishness ? When he wishes to assert a separate identity they hate him to death , they kill him ! " " Gregor 's loneliness , " she answers , " is based on the fact that he does not belong to this security-minded illusion of life but to the mysteryof a final vocation . That might be a lesson to all of us , Stephanie love ! You and I and all our sisters must remember that like men we have before us many lonely tasks of liberation . Our mothers have taught us to be the retarding and conservativeforce , to cling to the corrupt finery of civilization rather than fighting our servitude . Because we are slaves we have misshapen our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but use it more carefully , we have been given the historic vocation to rebuild society , always remember that there was a time when we were more free . " Yep , that 's what she said that day . Well , maybe next year at this time when I wake up I 'll be metamorphosed into a turkey , I must jot that down in a postcard to Claire , they 'll open the door to my room , like in Kafka , and see a large turkey parading her bright feathers and put me in the oven . This Thanksgiving has been as dreary as ever , with everyone clutching and embracing our beautiful children , and Paul hovering as tenderly as ever overp225his new dog , and my mother-in-law laughing like a hyena over her bourbon as she tells her forty-year-old son to cut his hair . Actually she has become relatively quiet and tranquil since the other sons ' deaths , when there was only one to go she became very relaxed , nicer than ever , she seldom meddles in our affairs , we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she pouts no more , she whines fifty percent less . She enjoys more than ever those radio commentators popular among rightwingerswho urge the government to destroy North Vietnam , get tougher with the longhairs , crack down on druggies , kill the kids . It is her way of requiem and liturgy , after Thanksgivingdinner in Boston we sit by the fire nursing drinks , listening to some guy saying on the radio , " The pinko peaceniksare lying through their teeth , the longhair student potheadsare undermining the nation 's heritage . " " Look at the sun , " she mumbles , " look at the beautiful sunset . " The good boy who excelled at Confucian dutifulness says gently , " That 's not the sun , Ma , that 's the moon . " " You 're wrong , " she says , " that 's the sun . " " No , Mother , " he says , " I assure you it 's the moon . " " O0000h000000 , the moon , " she warbles pleasantly , " what 's the difference ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What 's important tonight , I try to say with my eyes , is which comes first , Chronos or Oedipus ? To eat or to be eaten , that is the question for Thanksgiving night . Oedipus was left on the mountain to die even before he had the impulse to kill his father . Reread mythology , dark devouring parents , reread it constantly . You ate up my old friend Louis B. and you almost got me . Our neighbor John Burtz was found swinging from the ceilingof his farm shed last week by one of his seven children . He had wound a noose around his throat , then pulled the hydraulicp226lift of his bulldozer . He was a laughing , brawny man with meat on his breath , it was said that he loved machines excessively , that he was gadget crazy , deeply in debt . At the funeral , his two brothers come into the church trying to support his widow by each arm . A useless gesture , since she walks steadfast and crisply , supporting them if anything , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very close together in front of the grave , huddled together like cattle seeking warmth , the raw November air pierces like needles , the sky is of the low , unvariegated gray that precurses snow . The dead man 's mother , his widow and his brothers link hands behind each other 's backs and again in front , with a looping gesture that resembles an ancient peasant ritual , as if they are about to stomp their feet in a ritual dance . The widow suddenly breaks loose from the mesh of intertwined arms and , standing at the pit of the grave , stares down at the coffin not so much with grief as with anger , with a certain disgust . That week my son had asked me to get a pollywog from the nearby pond . After I get home I break the ice of the pond to get the animals , put them into a pail , take it into the kitchen sink to get more water . The child climbs eagerly upon the sink to see the operation , my hands shake after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life slither like so much refuse into the sewage . The child 's face screws up into a wail of despair , he stares at me with distrust for many days . But the widow Burtz 's attitude to death ! That 's a different cup of tea . The day after the funeral she stands at her door with a pot of geraniums in her hand , waving at me with elation . " Hi ! How nice to see you ! I 've had company all day ! " Inside her candy-littered house , kids are tumbling before the television , stuffing themselves on Cracker Jacks , arguing about what they 're going to wear to the restaurantthat night . " Mom , can I wear my green-and-white polkadotpants ? " " No , you ca n't , Sally you fink , they 're Doris ' ! " " Mom , when are we going out for chow ? " " I 'm taking them out to supper to this nice new Italian place where they make a greatp227lasagna , " the widow says cheerfully . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good life together , fifteen years , what more can you expect ? I do n't know what I 'd do if anything happened to one of them , but him ... " She smiles again , looking relieved . Deliverance , he must have been at her day and night , she looks relieved . For months to come , the town pastor  --  a Congregationalistwith a minted breath  --  keeps cornering me by the vegetable counter at the village store , saying , " That 's the trouble with our church , no way for men to talk out their problems , we ca n't give them as much help as you Romans can . It must have been a snap decision , there were thicker and more efficient ropes he could have used if he had planned ahead . In your church the confessional takes care of all that garbage of the unsaid , you 're lucky to have that channel of communication .

I kept thinking of them during those years of relentless search for man and God , God in man , man in God , brotherhood , whatever that means . Need for more religion , more communion , more conversation , the three interchangeable , need for a conversion or a brothel . Every few years I return to confession , sometimes out of the starkest of duties  --  in memory of my father  --  sometimes to see how it 's changed , what they 're up to , always with a thirst for talking . That 's how I come to sit week after week in the room of Father Gregory Hillsman , a friend from college days in Cambridge , who now receives me at the Jesuit compoundwearing summer shorts , sipping beer , his long lean legs crossed nonchalantly . " Resurrection , Greg . That 's where it 's at . Ever since thatvisit to my father 's grave I 've been very moved by that notion . " " Yes , but it 's the resurrection of a glorified ' body .

Yet modern anthropology tends to show that the ideal of fidelity debases womanhood , it 's based on men 's need to assure paternity so that they can pass on property to their sons . I do n't need to tell you how important that could be for your women 's movement ! By the way , kiddo , do you want to confess ? I 'd love to talk to you until the Parousia , but I know you 've got to go home to get chow for your kids . " He downs his beer . A sly smile . " Just like my sermons . A lot of foam and no body . Let me get another one , okay ? " He settles down with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . Whenever I go through this process I feel little emotion , little guilt or sorrow for whatever I recite , but I feel an ardent pleasure in participating in this historic process , in this ritual of purification that precedes the cannibalistic feast , I feel a high exhibitionist pleasure in recounting sexual fantasies to this man I have come to desire . His lean hound dog 's face resembles that of the young Teilhard , I watch it for a sign of surprise , but he is as much of a cool con person as I am , the high icy dome of his forehead never twitches at any recitation , the thin mouth remains tightly clenched , I could be talking to Sade 's analyst . " Uhum uhum , " he says occasionally , just like the shrinks . I enjoy staring at his high-laced basketball sneaker , Keds size eleven and a half , particularly at the large red emblem accompanyingthe words " All Star " on the instep . Two decades ago we had lived across the street from each other in Cambridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had sat together at the library , we had gone down together to work at the Henry Wallace headquarters . I had loved him secretly , with that burning love we can have only for those with whom we can not experience the flesh . Now as I stare out at the streetp229below I think , Let 's not kid ourselves , this jazzy modern church stuff is n't going to work , at first we were all so excited by it  --  the grape-juice-and-cookie guitar Masses , the abandonmentof the Latin and vestments and the dank confessional booths  --  but like all the other liberal solutions it 's a mess , it 's like the dribbling of token funds into the rotting cities or the Uncle Tom handouts to women , it wo n't do , it 's all got to be totally torn down and rebuilt again from cellar up , these new padres with the basketball sneakers and the swinging ethics grooving on the newest radical fads wo n't do either , all you 'll do is get drunk and stoned with them and fall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasping like a fish out of water , retaining control like most men , what a tease these priests have gotten to be , if anything they 're more destructive than ever . His eyes are hazel , speckled green and brown , careworn , the deeply chiseled , almost cavernous lid folds heavily at the outer edge . " Okay , absolution ? " he always says in a weary , gentle voice when I am through . And there is a blur of ritual words while I turn away , clutching at a button of my shirt , embarrassed by my lack of emotion , by the mood of curiosity dominating all of me . There are long oak tables , lazy susans of pickles and ketchup , a faint smell of beer and baking bread in the Jesuit refectory where I often join him for lunch . " What were we talking about earlier ? Ah yes , Christianity is the most physical , the most sensual of all faiths . " There is a teasing , cynical curve to his wry smile as he opens another beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this physicality , Steph , in the instinct lovers have to possess each other , to eat each other up . That 's what attracted me to the priesthood in the first place  --  the anthropological reality of it , the cannibalism . Hoc est Corpus Meum . Daily cannibalism , can you imagine ? You 've read in Levi-Strauss about how savages eat their most beloved heroes , in order to be saved by their mana . Is n't that what the Eucharist is all about ? "  |p230Once  as we sat on a park bench he touched my dress , took a fold of it and rubbed it gently between his fingers , as if to remind himself of what a woman 's garment felt like . Another time , while we sat talking in his car after he had driven me home after an antiwar meeting , he clutched a lock of my hair , twisting it softly with his thumb . Nothing else . " How many people are we going to try to get for this demonstration , " I ask him as an excuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local papers about next week 's talk-in , have you put the newsletter together yet ? " I take Communion from him twice , three times a week , I am temporarily at peace , never giving a thought to the flesh , I am sweeter than ever at home , as calm as the Sea of Azov , I am temporarily stoned on Christ , stuffed with religion . I want to cook and sew and scrub for Father Gregory , ah yes , that keen erotic pleasure of serving forbidden men which nuns have always treasured . " The psychological tests show that I need constantly to seduce people , " Gregory says one day as he paces his room . While pacing he repeatedly tucks his shirt into his lower back . " I know I 'm a flirt . I ca n't stand missing out on anything . I 'd like to experience all that the world has to offer . Visit every country . Sleep with every woman in the world . Ah well , civilizationand its discontents . " " Well , you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you ? Is n't it just another form of celibacy , since it involves a constant repression of instincts ? " " Right on . You see , the problem is that fidelity or celibacy would only be truly moral if we could choose it instead of having it imposed upon us . That would be the only truly ethical way , since choice is the only ethical condition of any act . I would n't mind being a monk if it was a choice within the priesthood . One could choose celibacy or fidelity as a preference over sex or promiscuity . That 's a rather beautiful idea . The way one prefers one woman to another . " " Well well , Father , do you think we 're ready for such freedom ? Ready to kick the Grand Inquisitor in the ass already ? "  | " And what do we get for our good conduct the way our system stands ? Do you still think it gets us better mansions in heaven ? " He gestures cynically toward the bed , upon which a pile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchiefs , two undershirts , three boxer shorts neatly aligned below the crucifix that hangs by his bed . " At times I think I know what I get from so-called good conduct , Greg . I 'm getting shelter , protection . Maybe the shelter I needed to grow into freedom . " " But that 's precisely the dilemma Freud left us with : Is your shelter worth it ? Is civilization as we know it worth the discontentit causes ? Do you remember one of the last lines from that incredible book ? Man 's judgments of value are nothing but an attempt to support his illusions with arguments ' ! " Six months later Gregory left the Jesuit order and I went on to other things , other obsessions . He came to dinner once shouting that civilization was not worth it , we must dare to be playful and unleash our instincts , rebecome polymorphous perverse . Due to the stranglehold he had over me I was still occasionally going to Mass , would continue doing so for some time . " How can you still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little hysterically , waving his arms about . " I have a veritable disgust for it . " This is My Body . Before leaving Boston he gave himself a swinging super-ecumenical going-away party , with Jewish folk songs , Sufi sayings , bouts of Zen meditation , a veritable smorgasborg . He moved on to California , where he became a controversial figure in academic circles and acquired still another doctorate , this time in medieval history , while teaching transactional psychology . Renounced by the Church for seditious writings , he publicly declared his decision to remainin the priesthood and maintain all its rules  --  except obedienceto Rome . Then he moved on to live in ashrams and conventsin India and in Africa , where he steeped himself in contemplation . In between bouts of confession-going I think of new ways to fuck , in ways as anonymous as possible , with strangers whomp232I 'll never see again , with whom I 'll never need to share what I describe in one of my journals as " the fetid burden of sentiment . " Other lines from journals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself with an incestuous precision . " Age thirtyfive : " I feel sanctity and wholeness only when I am two persons . " A few years further on , after Gregory : " Unification of my dual selves : That 's the mysterious center where I can start writing , that 's when the story can begin . " Her dominant idea and goal is freedom without responsibility , which is like gold without metal , spring without winter , youth without age , one of those maddening , coo-coo mirages of wild riches which makes her a typical product of our generation.  --  F. SCOTT FITZGERALD , The Crack UpI keep remembering how once , in Spain , my husband and I drove for eight hours through a black landscape that was like the inside of a gigantic onyx bowl , through fields of copper , barite , corycium , that had the sinister splendor of garnet and of jet . Our silence was as heavy as the devilish blackness we traversed . You drove your machine responsibly and silently , modern man , with such grim intensity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no relief of human voice . That dark valley used to remind me of our marriage , there were times when your silence and dependence wound around me likepools of darkness , when our void was like earth thrown upon my still live body . Particularly after Gregory left there were days when I felt , Nothing has worked , nothing can work , I am broken . But those days are past , I have gone through centersof darkness in which I was purified , I have begun to heal . And so , dear love , I have abandoned the image of that valley.  |p233I  am determined that our marriage must be like the life of the old lady who lives alone over my workroom in the barn . I hear her every motion , she is a lesson for life . From 9 A.M. on , her prayers are said , her high heels are on , she scuttles about her room as if she were tending an enormous household . I hear her above , clickety-click , scrubbing her tub , doing her breakfast dishes , down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes her two-hundred-yard walk to the mailbox , that is the expedition of the day , she gets dressed up in her best clothes  --  hats with butterflies , jeweled pins , the shoes with rhinestone buckles , also a beaded bag , lace gloves , lots of rouge . And she minces to the mailbox dressed as for a glorious Easter service , tripping on her heels and picking herself up again , each day a holiday , a carnival . Every night the old lady cooks as if expecting fine company , delicious odors waft down to me , stuffed peppers and cabbage , osso bucco , saltimbocca , they take hours to prepare , I saw her eating once , extraordinary show , there she sat alone in front of her lace doily and her tiny wineglass , smiling at the lonely meal . What manners , what discipline , what illusions ! Truly an existential heroine ! Solitude and death yawn at her like a lion , and how she defies the gravity of despair , as we all must do , acting as if each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must adorn our realities ? Are our characters to be attired like her poor body , either with silence or in masquerade , so as never to show ourselves in our nakednessand truth ? Perhaps , dear love , you 're right to talk so little , perhaps no two pilgrims must discover each other too well . And at times we do connect and re-create the ancient feast , clutching at each other in the night , always the great miracle and great surprise that it can happen again , that it can happen at all . Your reticence abated , you thrust down upon me like a turbulent animal , calling me your baby , your little girl , you tear into me more fiercely , you give me more pleasure than any man I 've every known . How mysterious that force is in its rareness , its equally great simplicity ! Afterward , our limbsp234still locked , we lie in the dark exchanging simple declarative sentences , such as " A snow plough , the last of the winter , " or " The pussy willow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At such times nothing else is needed . At other times so much more is needed that I do n't know , I do n't know how to proceed . Marriageis like the Church or the stranglehold of property , institutionsfull of the brutality and deceit of the past which we can not repair in patches , which must be reconstructed from the bottom up in order to survive , we must cut the forest down and replant it , leaving many homeless animals in our wake ... . On days when I have returned from one of my brief solitary trips I pass behind your chair as you sit hiding from the world behind your reading , and brush my hand over your forehead . You close your eyes and throw your head back at the touch , and the longing in your eyes fills me with anguish . In a terrifyingcentury you stand for all that is noble , nourishing , repressive . But your goodness is not the stuff of innovation and we must always move on , move on at increasing speeds in order to avoid decay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century that 's crass . Perhaps the other way around . Only history will tell . You fill me with guilt , eternal boy , you too are n't loved the way you 'd wish to be , you 'd have done better with a wife who peeled your apple , mended your clothes , worried about your silver and your china , shared your love of land and little tribe , your fear of people and of loneliness . But I with my searches , my nightmares , my causes , my need for crowds and solitude , what a burden I must be . Who are you ? Can we really ever know each other ? Is it dangerous to ask ? The house sleeps , my love sleeps , marriage is a long sleep , a large life , a long gestation . My love sleeps in that room I painted forest green in the first months of our marriage , when I swabbed my way through his house , obliterating the dowagerescorts and dank wallpapers of his bachelorhood , his mother 's laces , the musty cigars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it green like a cave , green for the long estivation of marriage , green for the shelter in which we both hibernated away the scars of our childhood , in which we shall gain the strength needed for our freedom . In this cave where we conceivedour children , where he often seeks repose from the exhaustionsof the twentieth century , there my great love still sleeps , his breathing calm and even under the acrylic coverlet , his knees thrust up to his chest , a pillow sheltering his head , dreaming perhaps of the solid beauty he will create in stone and steel . Seen at eye level , the green blanket that ' covers him seems made of moss , its spikes and spears resemble the tiny promontories of some spread of lichen , and so he seems to be as in the pit of our dark-green cave , in the warmest bottom of our animal hole . On the edge of the mantelpiece stand mementosof our passing enthusiasms and happy childhood days together , little painted stones , alabaster elephants , inch-high marble mushrooms , music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These childhood toys are what I would like to leave behind me , I desire instead to enter the Chinese painting of a plum tree which he hung by my bed early in our marriage . Its branches could be the design of my own life , they gush upward and northward , becoming more concentrated , narrower , more intense at their upward ends , they are full of knobs and promontories , of beautiful islands to rest in , I 'd like the end of my life to resemble the superb branch at the upper left which is segmented like the limb of a rearing horse and tapers to a fine hoof at the painting 's uppermost frontier . For up there at the top blossoms proliferate , rewards for my patience and hard-won freedom , blossoms as succulent as globes of fat floating on the broth at Jewish weddings but suspended on branches as austerely thin as the streaks of light that jut from prisms . And the second half of existence should ideally be like that painting hovering over us , all of one 's lifestreamleaner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat , less flesh , the body austerely kept , the house as emptied of stuffp236as a Zen monastery  --  that would be the beginning of the liberationfrom pain , desire , contradictions  --  nothing but the works of our imagination proliferating like the rich blooms on those sparse limbs . Upon the mantel of this room where we have spent the childhood of our marriage the wax dolls also hover over me , staring at our incubator like kind nurses through their glass panes . The smaller one is in blue taffeta , the larger in pink satin . The larger one has an air of compassion , she holds a wreath hung with silver ribbons which she thrusts out to me today like a muse awarding a prize . At her feet , in a crib of fern flanked by pink flowers , lies a baby-sized replica of herselfthe length of her two hands , an infant doll dressed in lace on whose chest a sparrow perches , its beak poised toward the baby 's mouth . I do not know what leads me to do now what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dome of glass , to touch her and end her immaculate protection from all history and change . The house is still in its sleep , as still as my marriage , the dogs stare at me with those great plum eyes of the Fayum women , with the anxious eyes of Moslem brides behind bars . I have placed a bouquet of purple iris and pink peonies by his bed , the whole house sleeps , his body rises and falls gently under the lichen of his blanket , he is the landscape of my life , the creator and obstructor of my freedom , I need him the way we need our daily bread , I miss him the way the sequestered bird misses her mate/his mate in the next cage , I would die both for him and for my freedom , which is now to be found elsewhere , outside this room , outside my body , outside our mothers ' illusions of security , in work , in dreams . The house 's rhythm is slowed to the rhythm of his breath , every inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slowed-down silent film , the cat 's whiskers twitch only once an hour , all is as slowed and paced as a sleeper 's pulse , I lift the dome very carefully , I stroke my finger across the doll 's forehead , fearful until the last moment that she will crumble and dissolve like ancient flesh . And indeed my touch leaves a train of darkness on herp237brow like the touch of embers on Ash Wednesday , the passage of my finger was more brutal than I expected , it could be the beginning of her destruction . And , terrified of this decimation , I put the dome back , sensing some magical connection between this green shelter and her future and mine . I worry about you as I leave the room , eternal boy , men like you who are so fetal and so rooted , where will you rest if your shelter is altered or rebuilt ? I leave the sleeping house and walk out into the terrifyinglysunny day , toward the nearby forest , all smells assail me at once , the sky is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and out of the cave , the lupine does not frighten me anymore , I can die anytime now , I become part of the oak tree and am carried beyond it , I am distilled into some severe essence of that tree , this dream is my knowledge , I am fragmented on the altar of light , the sky sings of streams and rivers to the ashes of my body , I am drunk with emptiness , my bitterness tastes sweet and my spirit is clear , I inhale the smoke that I shall be , my body is debased to humus , I shall survive it in some way , freedom is near , to be hunted like a treasure , to be measured in milligrams because of its dangers , to be taken in tons because of its beauty , to be transcended . The dream floats in and out , in and out , moving like fish on the surf of memory . Stephanie is choosing herself at last , walking off the ground , above the ground , sucking herself up , she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her so , whom she shall love again when she shares their humus . She is a child and free again , playing games in a large stand of oaks . She runs through the luminously beautiful forest , which is neon green , screaming green , the green yells and glows , claps its hands and sings , celebrates its harshness . She clutches at the largest leaves , she chases birds with branches of ferns , she snares butterflies with sprays of laurel . She moans with thirst after tasting all those mushrooms , she stumbles and falls , she is a savage again , in the dense brush she crawls on her knees , eating wild berries off the bushes , her lips as purple as a drowning man 's . She runs up ap238hill , the wind sings through the trees with a swelling , rolling sound like that of heavy surf . The smell of spring grass is rampant , the ground is brilliant with the fire of new poppies . She comes to a river bank and for a second Stephanie can not see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazing whiteness faces her , filling her eyes like a sheet of white-hot metal , and a wind rushes through her as she knows it will at the moment of her death . The water below her is as black as a diamond and as still as a shroud , the trill of the thrush is like water pouring out of a narrow-necked jar . She wades into a bank of orange lilies , face to face with a flower she moans her love for it , she wishes to enter it , to make love to it and be drowned in it , to explore its fuzzy caverns , its cloying recesses , its honeyed interstices . The lilies are up to Stephanie 's waist , she wades among them as into a sea , asking for entrance and for burial . Crouching in the bank of flowers , Stephanie rocks back and forth , back and forth , crying her wishes to be at her mother 's breast , in her father 's arms , to be reborn , to be a boy , to be free , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed the universe , to reenterthe paradise we once tasted and never forgot.  | ( The a certain psychological violence to it . Elijah has the rock station on full blast . He is stomping , stomping about the room , his long hair flying about him , chewing on a very large wad of gum . He is in his early twenties , very tall and very lean , with long , curling light-brown hair , a light growth of beard , deep-blue eyes with very long dark lashes . His features have a classic beauty , the nose is aquiline , there is a certain hardness to his thin , crisply chiseled mouth . He is wearing a flowered chiffon shirt , black leather pants . The black leather jacket that matches it is lying on the bed next to Elijah 's cameras and his shoulderstrapbag , out of which spill an assortment of grass and hash in plastic baggies , airline tickets , films , exposure meters , a copy of D.

She is also lean-limbed , blue-eyed , with a long , fine-boned face and curly ash-blond hair a trifle lighter than Elijah 's .

I may look like Joplin , but do n't you start telling me I look like a fag this way , Elijah says , we do n't use that word anymore , what do we call it , Steph ? Okay , Lija you 're gay , but I still wish you would n't act like a queen . If you call me a queen , Steph , I 'll call you a matron , how do you like being called a matron ? About as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I bet that 's not very much . Watch out , he says , standing over her and holding her arm , I 'm very strong , I 'm going to turn into a Hell 's Angel anyp243minute . Ouch , she laughs , let go , let go , okay , you 're just gay . Jesus , that bag of yours kiddo , you 're still carrying an SDS manifesto around , that 's incredible , you hang on to the sixties as if they were your balls or your virginity . Do n't you attack the sixties any more , he says , starting to dance again . You can give that to your stuffy middle-aged liberal Boston friends but not in this room with me . I came of age in the sixties , the sixties liberated me from my mother , my father , my military school , everything that had laid shit on me all my childhood .

Come on Steph lay off , will you , let me live with my own contradictions and you live with yours , okay ? You want everything , do n't you Lija  --  men , women , expensive restaurants , being a Communist , working for fashion magazines . Pablo Neruda had all that , Elijah says , why should n't I ?  |p244Ste|phanie  is lying back on her bed staring at the ceiling , thinking , I 'm even aping his language , talking like him , I guess that 's part of what I wanted , freedom , return to childhood .

Stephanie picks up the phone and says pronto , room service  --  could you bring me a very rare hamburger with an order of French fries . Thanks U.N . Elijah says , listen , I just thought of something , you promised to call that magazine editor , you said you 'd phone her to see if they could use a picture story on this meditation shtick here . I 'm tired Eli , I worked all afternoon and talked with Gregory for the first time all year . I 'm really exhausted , let 's do it tomorrow . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes , saying , I 'm tired . I 'm sorry , honey bun , Elijah says , I 'm driving you too hard , making too much noise , being a brat again . He turns off the radio , he lies down next to her and lays her head on his shoulder , he strokes her hair , her temples . I 'll call the operator and you just do the rest , Steph , all right ? She smiles . I already called that editor for you at noon , Lijie , she 's away on vacation until Monday , we 'll call then . You called , you called already ? Oh , you 're so sweet , Stephanie , I love you so much . L-O-V-E . L like Ladybird , 0 like ozone , V like venal , E like Elton John . Tell me you love me . I 'm very fond of you , she says , love is a big word . She brushes the curls off his face . Do n't say that Steph , I want your total and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to you when we met last month at that Third World rap in Ohio ? I said fantastic , we look like twins . It 's very narcissistic , but it 's true , I was struck by how alike we were , tallp245thin bodies , the color of our hair . You said out of sight , Lija . Well it sure was that Steph , it 's not every day you meet someonewhose book you ripped off two months ago . You never told me you ripped off a book of mine , Lijie , which one did you rip off ? The last book , the one on women . I was real broke Christmas Eve , I needed to give a present to my mom , I wanted one that would raise her consciousness . I ripped off your book at the University of Iowa bookstore . The week before I 'd ripped off a whole set of Conrad and an edition of Proust from the University of Southern Illinois bookstore  --  that was a good month . Did you ever buy anything , Elijah ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am , how else do you want a college dropout to get an education , how many peanuts a month do you figure I 'm making right now as a Free Press photographer ? We have every right to rip off the liberals ' bookstores when we 're oppressed . You are not oppressed , Eli , stop that nonsense . Look Steph let 's not argue about politics , okay ? I 've gone through enough Maoist study groups to make mincemeat out of you , and do n't try to make me into a liberal . I may become a conservative like my old man or else I 'll become more radical than ever but I 'll never be a liberal , never never never never . I guess that 's about the only thing in life you do n't want to be , a liberal , right , Lija ? Right . My shrink used to say that the sixties radicals have a streak of infantile regressiveness , Stephanie says , they want the whole world as if they 're still at their mothers ' breasts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ca n't take it , all shrinks stink , they 're as bad as those freaky guru friends of yours , freaky fratres , that 's what you surround yourself with , shit Steph when are you going to get off this meditation gig and write about something more relevant , like rock , movies , a novel ? You 've barely met Gregory Hillsman , she says , he 's one of my closest friends , I 'll be upset if you do n't get to know him better tomorrow , and Reed Weiss is a sweet guy , he wouldn'tp246hurt a fly . Well he might not go for your fly but he sure is eager for mine , Elijah says , the way he looked at me this morning I felt he was unzipping me from head to foot , actually I do n't mind if he does , his body is incredible , I love guys with great bodies . He 's more apt to try unzipping your mind , Stephanie says . He loves the idea of getting everyone to meditate . Well well we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll see . Hey Steph what do you think , let 's have an affair . Do n't be silly Eli darling , that 's the silliest thing I 've ever heard , you would n't he my Ariel anymore . Well just as long as we do n't have a relationship , Elijah says , I ca n't stand that word . Elijah laughs , his pretty teeth gleaming over his lipstickedmouth . I 'm going to write a letter to Ann Landers , he says . Dear Ann , I 'm so in love with a woman twenty years older than I am that I 'm ready to give up my gayness , which up to now has been my most precious jewel . What shall I do ? Signed , Lord Byron . And I 'll write her too , Stephanie says . Dear Ann , I 'm madly in love with a homosexual who is madly in love with me , but we ca n't decide whether to have an affair or not . Should we try the I Ching ? Signed , George Sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joint before we go out to dinner ? No thanks , Lijie , after four weeks with you I feel as if I have grass coming out of my ears , my nose , my ass , I really ca n't stand it more than a couple of times a week , it makes me feel miserable . What a generational gap , he says , if there 's one place in the U.S. where it 's easy to get Acapulco gold , this is it . What 's it like with boys , she says , stroking his hair , what do they like , what was it like between you and Joel for instance  --  how often did you do it ? At least once a day in the good times when we were n't fighting too much , I 'll never forget the time we did it on top of a cliff overlooking the Pacific , that was out of sight , he came in me and then I in him , and there was the roar of the ocean below . . . . God Steph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been with you I 'm not as obsessed as I used to be about sucking cock , you know most of the time for mep247it 's just sucking cock , blow jobs , and making love with Joel was incredible , his sperm was so sweet , it had a very special taste , as if it carried no semen , no reproductive matter , as if it were just a nectar . After Joel there was Conrad , and then Fred , nothing seems to last more than three months or so .. . hell Stephie , let 's get off that subject , Stephie you know what I enjoy most , after love ? After the sentiment of love , my favoriteemotion is that of irony . So let 's speak about ironic situations , Lijie . Look , Steph , I do n't believe in fidelity , but which would upset you the most , if I were unfaithful to you with a man or with another woman ? Well that 's one of the oldest questions around Lijie , it 's a tough one , you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for women it would make me feel like a success , as if I 'd been able to give you something . It was worse for me when Joel or Conrad went with women , Elijah says , it was much worse , a couple of times I wanted to kill myself . There you are , she says , there you are saying it , it 's the worse of the two pains because you feel you do n't have what they need that day . Maybe you want to be bisexual to be more like Joel and Conrad , to take their kind of revenge , eventually . Oh God Steph there you go with your shrink stuff again , it 's too heavy for me , I 'm not ready for it . I do n't want to look into myself yet . I 'm a child of nature , okay ? . . . I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to snap at you like that , you 've been so perfect , Steph , the way you have n't pushed me into anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me since I was sixteen , all boozed up coked up or just plain horny , I hated them , hated hated hated those women you understand , and here you are you 've just let me be , you 've just let me hug you and lie down next to you , oh God you 're such a friend . Hey Steph , have you ever loved anyone enough to die for them ? Sometimes I think I 'd like to have that just once before I die she says , have one powerful love that possesses , annihilates me utterly . . . actuallymaybe not , like most things that are frightening it 's yesp248and no , I want it and yet I do n't . I guess that 's the way the taco crumbles Stephie darling , one more thing , why do you write ? He puts his hand on her breast as tranquilly as if it were her arm , her head . She stares at his feet . For such a big man he has very little feet , and they have a sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking like small wounded pigeons . It 's the only part of him that is not beautiful and full of bravura . He has told her that his funny flat feet were his father 's fault  --  he blames everything on his father  --  his father took him to a crazy doctor who did a botch job on his arch supports , and his feet turned out strange . A bisexual friend of hers once told her that the men who were gay because they hated their fathers could change more easily than gays who were attached to their mothers . This friend also referred to homosexual love as ultimatelyinferior because it was of a " parodic " nature , that was an extraordinary word , that was an interesting lunch , that friend went on to talk of his great love for his wife and child ... Why do you write ? Elijah is asking , softly stroking her breast . Art is both a vengeance against reality and a reconciliationwith it , she says . I had n't thought of that he says , explain it . All art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my penis , my vengeance for not being a man , how do you like that , shnookums ? Jesus Steph , that 's heavy , have you ever had a lesbian experience ? Not all the way , I 've tried but I ca n't really get off , it just stays playful and sweet and that 's not enough , it does n't seem to possess me enough . Tell me one dream Stephanie before I go and take my shower . Okay , she says , very simple , just last night . I 'm on the beach and a very beautiful young man rises out of the ocean . He 's like a twin brother I have n't seen for a long time , he 's a long-lost part of me , someone with whom I shared a precious unity in childhood , like my long-lost other half . He tells me to meet him in a town in South America , and I do , and we have this idyllic life together , we do n't need to make love , we just live together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from this dreamp249I am muttering the words resurrection of the body . That boy was me , Elijah says , thank you darling that was a very beautifuldream , upon that I shall go and take a shower . As Elijah goes out of the room Stephanie is at the dressing table brushing her hair , singing a Bessie Smith song everyone sang during the summer workshops at Black Mountain twenty years ago or more ; " Black Mountain , where the babies are screa-ea-ming for liquor . . . and even the birds sing bass . " Hey that song is outrageous , Elijah yells from the shower , where 'd you get that ? That was in the fifties Stephanie says , the other song that was popular was " Come o-on my house , co-ome on , I 'm gon na give you Christmas tree , candy , everything , " do you remember , Oh my God of course you do n't remember Elijah , you were still wetting your pants . I still wet my pants when I think of you Steph , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big change , and also you said cosmic . In college we used to say cosmic the way you say cool or far out . Like lovemakingin the early dawn is cosmic , Mahler is cosmic , particularlyearly Mahler , Des Knaben Wunderhorn , and this Thunderboltis cosmic  --  that was a cocktail which was one-third gin , one-third rum , one-third bourbon , oh my , did we get stoned on that . . . Elijah is singing Springsteen in the shower and Stephanie lies back on the bed , thinking that for the first time in two years it 's like those summers before her children went away to college when she spent much time loading a car with all the things they had asked for  --  cookies and sodas and Frisbies , hamburgers and paperbacks  --  after years of that rich thin nurturing life in which every day was sliced up like a pie she had so needed to be alone , without any of the familiar tyrants about her , and yet here she was again , saddled with this beautiful bossy kid . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone about the psychic overhauling of Elijah Stewart , a twenty-three-year-old former-SDS-er , **30;3224;TOOLONG . God . The process is exhausting ,  |p250he  has to be fed , soothed , scolded , supported , taught , gotten jobs , edited , everything , adult ambition and gross motor activityworking all at once . Make me a milkshake , call this editor , teach me Spanish , let 's go swimming , I 'm going to the library make me a list of the twenty best contemporary Russian poets . After a few weeks of it she feels exhausted , done in . Every morning after having listened to Elijah talk until 4 A.M. she stands in front of the mirror looking for the lines from mouth to nose , the little crows ' feet or whatever they 're called that have deepened since her operation six months ago , the fine new webs that appear in the face of a woman past forty when she has had only a half night of sleep . For Elijah is at her like a suckling babe until the early hours of the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both , the two seem interchangeable to him . Oh God , this oral generation , brought up in front of the idiot box and getting instant gratificationfor every one of their desires , posing for photographs after each rebellion dressed up in their revolutionary costumes . Thank God her own children are out of the storybook seventies , sweet sunny boys who talk about graduate schools and party politics and biology and architecture , they are so different . . . . Elijah comes out of the shower , a towel wrapped around his waist . When his back is turned she looks at him while pretending to sleep , he is very quiet and thoughtful right now , tiptoeing about the room and respecting her medical need for rest , the rock station turned off at last . There is a violence about his beauty which has to do with the fact that one can not possibly conceive of him as ever getting older . He is perennial youth , therefore he will die still young , therefore his very youth and beauty have something violent about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? There in the room putting on a flowered shirt stands Nihil , who has asked her to keep him from dying alone . " I do n't want to be only a homosexual , " he has said , " I do n't want to end up a lonely old man like Aschenbach . " She is to give rebirth to one already adorned with sym/bols of death . Elijah is putting on the shirt she bought him two days ago . " That 's what I always wanted , " he 'd cried out , and she bought it for him , and the next thing she knew he was fingering an edition of Tolstoy , wanting that too , and she gave him that also . In the books she has read about these kinds of affairs , the women were the aggressors , but Elijah demanded to live with Stephanie the first week they met as adamantly as he demanded everything else , he is very imperious , bossing her about as few men have , she feels very ambivalent about whether she likes that or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what Narcissuswas looking for when he drowned in that pool Lija , he was looking for the image of his dead sister  --  that 's an interestingversion of the story . Hey that 's neat , Elijah says , I 've never heard it that way , listen Steph , I want you to put on that bright-red caftan and I want your hairpiece nicely done up right now and that 's an order . I want you to look really gorgeoustonight . I love to step out with you , you can still be so beautiful if you try a little . " Still , " she thinks . " Try a little . " Hurry up please Steph I 'm starved , and I want to see those early-evening lights on the town , so shake a leg , will you , kid ? God Lijie she says as she puts on her hairpiece ( he loves to help her with it , put the curls in the right place , put the pins in ) God I 've had a lot but I still have n't had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I envy more than anyone else on earth ? I envy a beautiful friend of mine called Claire who 's occasionally capable of loving a man or a woman , who divorced long ago , she lives in a flat in New York with a woman friend and they travel together or with other people when they feel like it  --  men or women  --  and she 's a prominent sculptor and does n't have my crazy need to constantly burden myself with people who have to be comforted , taught , nurtured . God , what a good life Lijie , why ca n't I find Claire 's kind of freedom ? And she puts her head down on the dressing table , shaking a little . Just calm down sweetheart Elijah says ,
