THE PRESIDENCY <P> A goodly portion of the nation 's lawyers seem to be in considerable anguish over the way the Watergate panel is questioning the witnesses . The letters , calls and telegrams pour in to Committee Chairman Sam Ervin with suggestions for questions , psychological tactics , and denunciations for missing opportunities to bludgeon witnesses to pulp . <P> In Washington , where there may be more attorneys per square foot than in any other city , the conversations are dominated by legal despair . The lawyers believe Ervin is doing an awful job in crossexamination . Young barristers and law school professors , freshly steeped in their textbook cases , are sure of it and can give you a lecture on how it should have been done . <P> There is now a hint in the mail that some of the public may want in on the act . Wives and husbands are arguing about separation of powers , reporters are being forced to carry copies of the Constitution with them . And all those people who were reared on Perry Mason , whose steel-trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering how come those fellows on the committee stammer , halt , fumble and they never get a witness to break down in tears and say " I did it . Take me away . " I wonder . <P> I wonder if old Sam Ervin from Morganton , N.C. , is n't a little wiser than all those kibitzers . Ervin is running an educational forum and not a court , and he knows it . The arguments are rooted in the Constitution , that is true , but now they transcend that . The big issue at this point is what each citizen thinks in his mind and feels in his heart about the President . <P> A big part of Ervin 's job , as he sees it , is to bring all the President 's men before the public , as well as the committee , and let anybody interested see them and hear them . He is resolute in his belief that there is something magic about truth . The folks after a while get some notion of who is lying and who is not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blinding flashes of acrimony . The witnesses kind of do it themselves . <P> So old Sam runs a down-home operation with a bunch of good old boys on his committee . There 's a war veteran with an arm missing and a camera bug and an Ivy Leaguer and a fellow who used to cure country hams . There is some courtliness , a little cussing beyond earshot , some poetry , and a lot of Bible . <P> The White House does not see it that way , however . Over there they have decided that Ervin is out to get the President , that behind the " sweet little ole country bumpkin " facade lies a monster . Memories are short in this town . The Ervin committee is about as gentle as they come .
