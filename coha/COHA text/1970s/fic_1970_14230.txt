The stage is dark . You ca n't see anything . MIKE I heard something . She definitely made a noise . RUTH Shut up . MIKE I 'm telling you , I know the noise they make . That was it . RUTH For chrissakes , be quiet . You keep talking and she 'll know we 're here . COOTIE I was just thinking . I read somewhere about how they can see in the dark . RUTH I never read that . COOTIE No shit , I read they got these hundreds of thousands of millions of tiny , submicroscopic , photosensitive cells in each eyeball , so when it gets dark they can just turn on these cells and see like it was daytime . MIKE He 's right , Ruth . Hey , Cootie , you 're right . I remember reading that in a back issue of the Vertebrate Review . COOTIE That 's it , that 's the one . Special eyeball issue . MIKE Yeah , yeah . July . RUTH You guys must be pretty stupid if you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The whole point of whiskers in the first place is so you can get around in the dark . That 's why they stick out so far , so you do n't bump into things . Chairs and refrigerators and that . p. 3 MIKE Hey , shhhh . I think she 's starting . RUTH Well , you 're the one that got me going about whiskers in the first place , so do n't tell me shhhh . MIKE O.K. , O.K. , I 'm sorry , O.K. ? RUTH So shut up if she 's starting . COOTIE ( Pause ) : How many kittens can they have at any one session ? MIKE There 's recorded case of thirty-eight . RUTH Shhhh , for chrissakes . COOTIE What I want to know is how are we gon na see her when she starts giving birth ? RUTH Jesus , how stupid can you get ? We 'll turn on the light . COOTIE Yeah , but the whole thing is how do we know when to turn on the light ? Like , what if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , what if we 're too late ? MIKE Or right in the middle COOTIE Holy shit , yeah , what if we flip on the old lights when she 's halfway through a severe uterine contraction ? She 'll go apeshit and clamp up and kill the kitten . And if the kitty gets really lucky and wriggles free , it 'll grow up into a pretty fucked-up animal . p. 4 MIKE We 're sowing the seeds of a neurotic adult cathood COOTIE doo-wah , doo-wah RUTH Hey , shut up , you guys , willya ? Willya shut up ? COOTIE We 're just pointing out that 's a shitty way to start life . RUTH I know the noise , all right ? MIKE I think there 's probably a more scientific way to watch a cat give birth . RUTH Everybody shut the fuck up . ( A long pause . ) NORMAN How much longer are you guys gon na have the lights out ? COOTIE Jesus Christ , Norman , why do you have to go creeping up like that ? We forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeping up . I 'm just sitting here . Maybe you did n't notice when you came in , but I was reading this book . I mean , I thought you were only gon na have the lights out for maybe a few minutes or something , but you 've already been in here for about an hour and and I really ca n't read very well with the lights off . I mean you know COOTIE Norman , you ca n't rush a cat when it 's giving birth . You try to rush a cat in those circumstances and you come smack up against nature . p. 5 MIKE Norman NORMAN What ? MIKE Do n't fight nature , Norman . NORMAN I 'm not . I 'm just trying to read this book . COOTIE ( Pause ) : Is it a good book ? RUTH For chrissakes , what 's the matter with everyone ? NORMAN I do n't know . It 's a pretty good book . I do n't follow all of it . It 's written in a funny kind of way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've read it . A lot of guys in the mathematics department say it 's pretty good . I do n't know though . RUTH Hey , Norman , ca n't you go to your room if you want to read ? NORMAN I do n't want to . MIKE Why not , Norman ? COOTIE Yeah , why do you want to creep around in here being all spooky and everything when you could just go to your room and read , huh ? NORMAN I do n't know . COOTIE We may be in here for hours and hours , Norman . Maybe even all night . The whole operation from initial labor to the biting off of the umbilical cord could very easily take an entire night . ( Pause ) Norman ? p. 6 NORMAN All night , huh ? COOTIE You never know . RUTH Brother , you try to get a few guys to shut up for a little while MIKE ( Loud ) : C'm on , c'm on , hey , everybody , let 's have a little quiet around here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads and start running in all different directions knocking down passersby and trampling on innocent women and children . RUTH I swear to Christ , Mike , if you do n't shut up I 'll kill you . MIKE O.K. ( At this point , the hall door opens and the kitchen is lit up a little . Dick is standing in the doorway trying to see into the dark , where Norman is sitting at a round kitchen table with a book by him , and Ruth , Mike and Cootie are crouched around a cardboard carton with a hole in it . Norman grabs up his book to take advantage of the crack of light . Dick just stands there . Ruth and Cootie speak on top of each other . ) RUTH Hey , c'm on , shut the door , Dick . COOTIE Shut the fucking door . MIKE ( After a pause ) : We 'd really like you to shut the door , Richard . ( Dick shuts the door and everything goes black . A moment later it all lights up again because Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has an automatic light inside . So now we see Dick squatting in front of the icebox while the others watch him , except for Norman , who 's really trying like mad to read . You can see the kitchen pretty clearly now . The icebox is very old , dating from the time when electricity was replacing the iceman . It 's just a box on legs with one of those barrel-shaped coolers with vents on top . You maybe ca n't see it yet , but on the door of the icebox there 's a large inscription that reads " GOD IS COOL . " Stacked neatly against one wall are eight hundred sixteen empty two-quart milk bottles , layer upon layer with planks between each level . It 's a deliberate construction . There 's a huge copper stack heater in one corner by the sink , and it has a safety valve at the top with a copper tube coming out of it and snaking into the sink . The floor is vinyl , in imitation cork , alternating light and dark , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-finished . Where the cork tiles end there is a border of black tar , by now hard , and then wooden floor in broad plank . Around the kitchen table are six chairs , all from different sets . Various posters on the wall , but none as conspicuous as a map of Europe near where the telephone hangs . The sink is full of dirty dishes . There is a pad hanging by the icebox , and a pencil . Everyone uses the kitchen in a special way . So Dick is squatting in front of the open icebox. ) p. 7 RUTH That 's very cute , Richard . MIKE C'm on , shut the fucking icebox . We were in here first . NORMAN I was reading when you guys came in . ( Dick turns to them , looks , then turns back to the icebox . ) COOTIE Dick , in my humble opinion you 're a miserable cunt and a party pooper . DICK ( Standing ) : All right , now listen . This afternoon I went down to the Star Supermarket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-eight hamburgers , and I only had two of them for dinner tonight . RUTH And you never washed up . MIKE Hey , Dick , are those Star hamburgers any good ? DICK Listen , I should have forty-six hamburgers , and when I counted just now there was only forty-three . Three hamburgers in one night . And for your information I 've been keeping track of my hamburgers since the beginning of the semester . There 's almost fifty hamburgers I ca n't account for . COOTIE Jesus , Dick , you should have said something before this . MIKE Yeah , Dick , you had all them hamburger thefts on your mind , you should have let it out . It 's no good keeping quiet about something like that . p. 8 DICK Look , I 'm not about to make a stink about a couple of hamburgers here and there , but , Jesus Christ , almost sixty of them . I 'm putting it down on common stock and we 're gon na all pay for it . ( He turns on the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please ? DICK I 'm sorry , but I 've lost too many hamburgers . I 'm putting down for four dozen . ( He goes to the pad on the wall and makes an entry ) RUTH Now willya turn the light out ? DICK ( Examining list ) : Shit , who put peanut butter down on common stock ? MIKE I did . I got a jar of chunky last . Thursday and when I opened it on Saturday somebody 'd already been in there . I did n't eat all that chunky myself . DICK Well , I never had your peanut butter . I 'm not paying for it . MIKE Well , I never had any of your goddamn sixty hamburgers either . COOTIE I think I may have had some of that chunky peanut butter . Could you describe your jar of chunky in detail ? MIKE Elegant little glass jar , beige interior ( Kathy enters through the front door , as opposed to the hall door . The hall door leads to everyone 's rooms. ) p. 9 KATHY Oh , boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen to the hall door . She carries lots of books in a green canvas waterproof book bag slung over her shoulder ) RUTH What 's wrong with Bob ? KATHY He 's in a really shitty mood . I 've seen the guy act weird before . This is , I do n't know , pretty bad , I guess . MIKE Where is he ? COOTIE Yeah , where 's Bob ? MIKE Good old Bob . COOTIE Where 's good old Bob ? KATHY And fuck you too . I 'm serious . NORMAN ( Looking up from his book ) : Boy , I really ca n't absorb very much with everyone talking . KATHY We were just sitting there , you know , in Hum 105 , and that prick Johnson started in about the old cosmic equation again . NORMAN What 's the cosmic equation ? RUTH So why 'd that upset Bob ? KATHY I do n't know . That 's the thing DICK I bet Bob 's responsible for some of my hamburgers . I notice you and him never go shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way he sort of well , like today , you know I 'm not kidding , he might be cracking up or something . ( Bob enters through the front door , carrying his books . He looks all right . Everyone stares at him . ) RUTH Hi , Bob . MIKE Hi , Bob . COOTIE Hi , Bob . NORMAN Hello , Bob . BOB ( Pause ) : Hi , Mike , hi , Ruth , hi , Cootie ; hello , Norman . ( Pause ) Hi , Dick . DICK Listen , do you know anything about ? BOB No , I have n't touched your fucking hamburgers . DICK Well , someone has . MIKE How you been , good old Bob ? COOTIE How 's the old liver and the old pancreas and the old pituitary and the BOB Is there any mail ? COOTIE There 's this really big package from Beirut . It took four guys to get it up the stairs . MIKE We think it 's a harp . RUTH There 's a letter in your room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall . Kathy follows him. ) p. 11 RUTH I think Kathy 's right . There 's definitely something wrong with Bob . DICK Yeah , he 's out of his fucking mind , that 's what 's wrong with him . RUTH You can talk . MIKE Hey , c'm on , c'm on , let 's have a little order around here RUTH Stop fucking around . You heard what Kathy said . Something 's troubling Bob . MIKE So what ? COOTIE Yeah , fuck Bob . MIKE Fuck good old Bob . NORMAN Maybe he 's worried about the future . ( All look at him ) I mean , you know , maybe he 's worried about it . I mean , I do n't know him all that well . Just , you know , maybe he 's worried about what he 's gon na do when , you know , after he graduates and everything . DICK He ought to be worried . MIKE You bet your ass he ought a be . Same goes for all of you guys . You ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a be worried . I ought a be worried . I am . I 'm fucking petrified . You watch what happens at the graduation ceremony . There 's gon na be this line of green military buses two miles long parked on the road outside and they 're gon na pick us up and take us to Vietnam and we 'll be walking around one day in the depths of the rain forest looking out for wily enemy snipers and carnivorous insects and tropical snakes that can eat a whole moose in one gulp and earthworms sixteen feet long and then one day when we least expect it this wily sniper 'll leap out from behind a blade of grass and powie . Right in the head . I 'm worried . p. 12 DICK Anyone that can spell can get out of Vietnam . NORMAN I 'm in graduate school . They ca n't get me . DICK Norman , you could n't buy your way into the army . NORMAN I would n't go . MIKE Why would n't you go , Norman ? NORMAN Huh ? COOTIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They need good mathematics graduate students out there in the marshes of Quac Thop Chew Hoy Ben Van Pho Quay Gup Trin . NORMAN I do n't agree with the war . MIKE Well , for God sakes , then , let 's stop it . NORMAN I had my medical and everything . I passed . I could 've pretended I was insane or something . DICK Pretended ? RUTH Hey , does n't anyone here give a shit about Bob ? MIKE Hey , c'm on , everyone that gives a shit raise your hand . ( Cootie , Mike , Dick and Norman raise their hands ) See , we all give a shit . So what should we do ? RUTH Well , I do n't know . Maybe we ought to try and find out what 's troubling him . p. 13 DICK Maybe he does n't want us to know . Just maybe . COOTIE Yeah , what if he 's teetering on the brink of a complete schizophrenic withdrawal and the only thing keeping him sane is knowing we do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classmates and favorite turds to leave him alone . RUTH Maybe something 's wrong between him and Kathy . DICK Like what ? RUTH I do n't know . That 's what I 'm asking . DICK He does n't give a shit about her . Not really . She 's just a good lay , that 's all . RUTH How would you know , Dick ? NORMAN I thought they were in love . DICK Jesus , Norman , where the hell is your head at ? NORMAN Huh ? MIKE Define the problem , then solve it . COOTIE Yeah , what 's troubling good old Bob ? MIKE I think we ought a all go to bed tonight with notebooks under our pillows , and when we get a well-focused and comprehensive idea about the central dilemma of Bob 's existence we ought a write it down in clear , concise sentences , with particular attention to grammar and punctuation . p. 14 COOTIE Yeah , then we can meet in here tomorrow and pool our insights . MIKE That 's a really great plan . RUTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DICK I 'd really like to know who the fuck is eating my hamburgers . NORMAN Why do n't you talk to him ? RUTH What ? NORMAN I mean , you know  --  Bob . If you want to find out what 's troubling him , probably the best thing to do is talk to him and say , What 's troubling you , or something like that , and then if he wants to tell you he can and if he does n't feel like talking about it then well , you know RUTH Yeah , maybe I 'll do that . NORMAN ( Pause ) : Yeah , that 's what I 'd do if I wanted to know . I mean , I 'm not saying I would n't like to know what 's troubling him . I 'd really like to know if you find out , but I ( Mike has been kneeling by the cat box and peering into it . ) MIKE Jesus Christ . Jesus H. fucking Christ . NORMAN What 's wrong ? MIKE She was n't even in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were looking at an empty box and she was n't even in there ? MIKE She must 've slipped out while we had our backs turned . COOTIE Sneaky little beastie . MIKE Cootie , you do n't understand . She might be out there in the road right now . COOTIE Right now . MIKE With all the traffic . COOTIE Oh , Christ , and all those architects driving home drunk from seeing their mistresses MIKE And trying to figure out what to tell the little woman . I mean , she 's been waiting up all night in a chartreuse quilted sleeping gown with curlers in her hair COOTIE Worrying about the kiddies . Three boys , twenty-seven girls . They all got appendicitis MIKE Simultaneously . And when she called the kindly family doctor he was away in Cuba COOTIE Doing research for his forthcoming book MIKE " Chapter Eight : Peritonitis and Social Democracy . " COOTIE Jesus , I hope we 're not too late . ( He and Mike rush off down the hall ) p. 16 DICK Hey , Norman , are these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mind . ( Dick takes one and puts the others back in the icebox . Cootie sticks his head in around the hall door . ) COOTIE You coming , Ruth ? RUTH No . COOTIE Your heart is full of bitterness and hate , Ruth . ( His head disappears again ) DICK You done the essay for Phil 720 ? RUTH No . DICK It 's due tomorrow . RUTH Yeah ? DICK Yeah . NORMAN Is that a good course , Philosophy 720 ? RUTH Nope . Professor Quinn is an albino dwarf queer with halitosis and he smokes too much . DICK He does not . RUTH Three packs of Pall Mall a day is too much . He 's gon na die of cancer . DICK He 's a genius . RUTH You have a thing about queers . DICK Fuck off , Ruth . p. 17 RUTH You started it . ( She goes into hall . Dick stands and eats his banana , chewing slowly . Norman tries to read but Dick 's presence distracts him ) DICK How come you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's supposed to be pretty good . DICK What are you gon na do when you finish it ? NORMAN ( Thinks ) : I 'll start another one . DICK Yeah , but what happens when you forget this one . I mean , it 'll be as if you had n't even read it , so what 's the point ? NORMAN Oh , I do n't know . I happen to believe you learn things even when you do n't know it . Like , if you 're reading something right now I mean , I am reading something right now and maybe I 'll forget it in a while I mean , I 'm forgetting a lot of it already , but I happen to believe I 'm being altered in lots of ways I may not be aware of because of well , you know , books and experiences . ( Pause ) Life . DICK That 's what you believe , huh ? NORMAN Um , yes , I believe that . ( Mike and Cootie enter , wearing heavy winter parkas and boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we 're too late I hate to think of all the dead cats we 'll have on our conscience . MIKE You gon na help , Dick ? DICK Fuck off . MIKE How about you , Norman , are n't you gon na do your bit for the world of cats ? NORMAN I 'm just in the middle of this chapter . ( Mike and Cootie shake their heads in disapproval and rush out . Norman tries to read again as Dick eats the banana , watching him ) Hey , it 's really hard to read , you know , when someone 's watching you and everything . DICK Do n't you ever get the feeling you 're really irrelevant ? NORMAN I do n't think so . DICK ( In one breath ) : I mean , you go into the mathematics department every day and sit there looking out the window and thinking about cars and women and every now and then a couple of numbers come into your head and there 's all these Chinese guys running around solving all the problems worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing . NORMAN No , it 's not like that . Well , you know , it 's not that simple . I mean ( Pause ) I guess it 's a lot like that . Are you doing anything relevant ? p. 19 DICK You ca n't get more relevant than Far Eastern studies . Ask me anything about the Far East and I 'll tell you the answer . That 's where everything 's happening . China , Vietnam , Japan , Korea . You name it . NORMAN I guess I ought to know more about those things . I do n't know , I keep thinking there 's a lot of things I should know about . DICK The thing is , Norman , the way I see it , you 're already deeply committed to the system . You take away black ghettos , stop the war in Vietnam , distribute the wealth equally throughout the country , and you would n't be in graduate school . NORMAN How come ? DICK You see , you do n't know anything about what makes it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peel into the cat box ) NORMAN Hey , you should n't throw that in there . DICK Why not ? NORMAN Well , I mean , that 's the box for the cat . Maybe she wo n't want to have kittens on a banana peel . DICK Norman , how long have you been living here ? NORMAN Well , you know , about three months . A little longer maybe . About three months and two weeks altogether . p. 20 DICK Have you ever seen a cat around here ? NORMAN Well , I do n't know . I 'm out a lot of the time . DICK Norman , there is no fucking cat . We have n't got a cat . Boy , for a graduate student you got a lot to learn . ( He starts out but turns to look Norman over a last time ) Jesus . ( Then he 's gone down the hall . Norman kneels by the cat box and examines it as some muffled piano chords fill the silence . It 's Bob playing a lazy , rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen in a man 's robe , carrying a towel . She lights the stack heater . From inside the hall we hear Dick 's voice yelling ) DICK STOP PLAYING THAT FUCKING NOISE . I 'M TRYING TO READ . HEY , BOB . KATHY ( Goes to the hall door and yells down ) : Mind your own goddamn business , Richard . ( A door slams , and the music , which had stopped momentarily , starts again , but louder . She turns ) Hey , listen , Norman . If you 're gon na be in here for a while could you do me a favor and make sure no one turns off the water heater , ' cause I 'm just taking a shower . And if you get a chance , could you put on some coffee , ' cause I 'll be coming out in about ten minutes and I 'd like a cup when I come out . O.K. ? p. 21 NORMAN Do you have any books on Vietnam ? KATHY ( Pause ) : Yeah . A few . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , some are , some are n't . Why ? NORMAN I just , you know , wondered , that 's all . ( Kathy watches Norman go to the stove and fumble around with the coffee percolator . She shrugs and goes out . We hear the bathroom door close and , moments later , the sound of a shower running ) Actually , I 've been thinking I 'd like to read some books about Vietnam . I mean it 's been going on all this time . I do n't know , though . I 've never read any books about it . Maybe if I could read one book , then I 'd know a little more about it and I could decide if I wanted to read another . Would it be O.K. if I borrowed one of your books to start with ? I 'd give it back as soon as I finished it . ( He looks around and sees he 's alone . He goes out the door . We hear the bathroom door opening and a yell ) KATHY ( Offstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here ? NORMAN ( Offstage ) : I was wondering if you 'd lend me KATHY ( Offstage ) : Hey , get the hell out of here , I 'm taking a shower . ( A door slams. ) p. 22 NORMAN ( Offstage ) : I just wanted to know if it was O.K. for me to borrow one of those books about Vietnam . KATHY ( Offstage ) : Well , Jesus Christ , ca n't you wait till I 'm done ? NORMAN ( Offstage ) : Oh yeah , I 'm sorry . ( Pause ) Is that all right with you ? KATHY ( Offstage ) : Hey , do n't stand around out there . You can borrow as many goddamn books as you want , only get away from the door , ' cause it just so happens I do n't like a lot of people standing around outside the bathroom door while I 'm washing . ( Norman comes back into the kitchen . He fixes a little more of the coffee , then goes to the hall door and yells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffee first , and when you 're finished in there I 'll come down to your room with you and get the book . Hey , listen , if you decide to have your coffee in here , could you go down to your room first and bring the book in with you ? Yes , that 's probably better . Hey , is that O.K. ? ( Pause ) Hey , is that O.K. ? ( No answer . Norman is left baffled , as the lights dim and Bob 's piano chords keep going and going. ) @x It 's a few days later . Norman is reading . Ruth is making sandwiches , and Cootie and Mike are rolling up a banner . COOTIE I do n't know about the wording . MIKE I think it 's pretty good wording . COOTIE I 'm not too happy about it . MIKE You 're unhappy about the wording . COOTIE Well , I 'm not , you know , cut up about it or anything , but I 'm definitely not as happy as I could be about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice over here . RUTH Who wants orange marmalade ? MIKE I 'd like an orange marmalade . COOTIE I want two orange marmalade and one chunky peanut butter , please . RUTH How ' bout you , Norman ? COOTIE And I would n't mind a chunky peanut butter and orange marmalade mixed . RUTH Hey , Norman , do you want sandwiches or not ? COOTIE You got ta have sandwiches handy if you 're coming , Norman . On your average march you 'll find you get through a good two peanut butter and jellies before you even get to where you 're supposed to demonstrate , and then after circling round and yelling militant slogans at the monument or park or poison-gas plant or nuclear-missile establishment for a couple hours , you 're just about ready for another peanut butter and jelly . p. 24 MIKE Or cream cheese and olives . COOTIE Bacon , lettuce and tomato . I mean , I know you meet a lotta pretty groovy people at these marches , but you ca n't count on them having extra sandwiches for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me if you 're coming with us or not ? NORMAN ( Unfriendly ) : I 'm going with Dick . COOTIE You 're lucky there . You 'll get hamburger on toasted roll if you go with Dick . He takes sterno and cooks right out there in the middle of lines of charging cops and tear gas and mace and everything . ( Dick enters . ) MIKE Hey , Dick , you better hurry up and get dressed for the march . COOTIE Yeah , Dick , you do n't want to be late or all the best ass 'll be grabbed up . DICK ( Indicating banner ) : What 's it say ? COOTIE " Buy Government Bonds . " RUTH You want some of our peanut butter and marmalade ? MIKE What 's this about giving away all our peanut butter and marmalade all of a sudden ? He would n't give us any of his lousy hamburgers . We had to pay for those hamburgers on common stock . p. 25 DICK Where 's Kathy and Bob ? MIKE Yeah , where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUYS , ARE YOU COMING ? KATHY ( Inside ) : Yeah , hold on a minute , willya ? MIKE They 're coming . COOTIE Hey , Norman , I been watching you pretty closely for the last few days and I have this definite impression you 've been displaying hostility toward me , Mike and Ruth , in that order . NORMAN I 'm just reading this book COOTIE Do n't be negative , Norman . You 're trying to pretend I had n't noticed your emotions . You happen to be up against a disciple of Freud , Jung , Adler , Pavlov , Skinner and the honorable L. Ron Hubbard , to mention but a few . It just so happens I can detect subatomic trace particles of hostility within a six-mile radius of anywhere I am . MIKE It 's no use contradicting him , Norman . If he says he can feel hostility , that 's it . I mean , even I can feel it and I 'm only moderately sensitive to hostility up to about a hundred eighty yards . NORMAN I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're dying to tell us about it . That 's a basic axiom of hostility . p. 26 NORMAN Oh , boy , you guys . DICK Leave him alone . COOTIE Dick , that 's the worst thing you can do . I know you think you 're being a good shit and everything , but if the guy is riddled with hostility and he does n't get it out of his system , it 's gon na go haywire and zing all around inside his body till he 's twenty-eight years old and then he 'll get cancer . RUTH You know , we 're gon na be really late if those guys do n't hurry up MIKE That reminds me of a guy I was reading about . He got so pent up with hostility his head fell right down inside his body , no shit , that 's what I was reading , right down between his shoulders . COOTIE Fell ? MIKE Yeah , straight down till all you could see was these two little eyeballs peeping out over his collarbone . COOTIE Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Fell ? MIKE ( Pause ) : Sank ? COOTIE Subsided . MIKE Right . COOTIE In fact , as I remember it , his head eventually disappeared completely . p. 27 MIKE Do n't rush me , I 'm coming to that . Now , Norman , I want you to pay very close attention because this case is a lesson in itself . You see , everybody used to warn this particular guy to loosen up and maybe see an analyst , but the guy refused on the grounds that it would cost too much , and that turned out to be really stupid economy , because with his head inside him like that he could n't see anything and he had to hire a guy , full time , seven days a week , to lead him around . The guy was so tight with his money he tried to solve the problem by rigging up this ingenious system of mirrors , like a periscope , but the natural movements of his body kept knocking the mirrors out of alignment , so in addition to the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy , full time , seven days a week , to keep readjusting the mirrors . You can imagine the expense involved . COOTIE There was a very fine article about that guy in the Hostility Journal , spring number . Did you happen to catch that article , Norman ? MIKE Did it tell about what happened to him ? COOTIE Well , it was one of those stories in two parts , and would n't you know it , that 's just when my subscription ran out . MIKE Oh , well , you missed the best part . You see , when his head got down as subsided as far as his stomach p. 28 COOTIE thank you MIKE he went and hired a top-notch transplant surgeon to replace his belly button with a flexible , clear plastic window so he could see where he was going . COOTIE Jumpin ' Jehoshaphat ! MIKE And I 'm happy to announce , the operation was a complete success . COOTIE Fantastic ! No problems with rejection or anything ? MIKE Nope . The Dow Chemical Company set up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clear plastic window that matched the guy 's antibodies perfectly . In a matter of weeks , the guy was able to live a completely normal life again , skin diving , stamp collecting , a lot of political work . He could even go to the movies when he felt like it , but he had to sit up on the back of the seat and it caused a lot of hard feelings with the people sitting directly behind him . But that 's the great thing about the average moviegoing audience ; they respected his infirmity . COOTIE Fuck a duck ! MIKE Shut up , sonny boy , I ai n't finished yet . COOTIE There 's more ? MIKE Yeah , you see , the really incredible thing was when the guy woke up one morning and realized his head was still sinking p. 29 COOTIE subsiding MIKE and he went to this doctor to check it out . He was just walking along , you know , and when he got to this corner to stop for a red light a dog peed on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making his pants wet a guy on some scaffolding right behind dropped a pipe wrench on his back , and the impact of this wrench , plus the slightly inclined position of the guy 's upper body , knocked his head back into place . COOTIE Hot diggity ! MIKE Well , the guy went apeshit , jumping all over the place , singing songs right out there on the streets and that 's just when it all had to happen . This poor guy , after all his suffering , was finally looking forward to a happy and productive life COOTIE Oh , shit , yeah , I remember now . The poor son of a bitch . MIKE Yeah , you ' member , he was just standing out there in the street stopping traffic in both directions , tears of humble gratitude streaming down his cheeks and some stupid ( He sees Kathy and Bob standing in the hallway door ready for the march ) oh , hi , Bob , hi , Kathy . RUTH Hey , do you guys want some of our peanut butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement . COOTIE We used to have a nearsighted canary RUTH Listen , I got ta make these sandwiches and we 're gon na end up short if I do n't get some cooperation around here . COOTIE Hey , Norman has n't even got a banner . Norman , are n't you gon na bring a banner ? BOB Mel , willya please shut up ? I 'm trying to tell you guys something . COOTIE Well , fuck you , I 'm talking to Norman . You want him to get all the way down to the demonstration and they disqualify him ' cause he does n't have a banner . RUTH Everyone is gon na fucking well eat whatever I make . DICK You want some help ? RUTH Look , it 's not like I do n't know how to make sandwiches MIKE Hey , everyone , e'mon , e'mon , let 's have a little order around here . Everybody stay where you are and do n't panic . O.K. , Bob , I think we got everything under control now . BOB Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just got this p. 31 MIKE Bob ? BOB What ? MIKE Anytime . BOB What ? MIKE Anytime you want a little peace and quiet so you can make an announcement without a lot of people talking over you , just ask me and I 'll do what I can for you . BOB Thank you , Mike . MIKE That 's O.K. , Bob , you 're a good shit . BOB ( Hesitates , trying to find words to frame his vague thoughts . When he speaks , it is halting ) : Look I just thought maybe it was about time somebody around here MIKE Do you want some water or anything ? RUTH Oh , for chrissake , shut up , Mike . COOTIE ( Cooling things ) : Yeah , shut yer mouth , sonny boy , yer creatin ' a public nuisance . RUTH Go on , Bob . BOB No , no , look , all I want to say is Norman , if there is one way to remain irrelevant and ineffective it 's to sit with your nose buried in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norman looks up and closes his book ) Thank you . O.K. Announcement ( He walks around the room , again trying to think of how to put it . As he starts to speak ) p. 32 MIKE Earthquakes in Singapore ? RUTH ( Incredible rage ) : SHUT UP ! BOB Never mind . MIKE Sorry . I 'm sorry . KATHY What 's wrong , Bob ? BOB Really , nothing , nothing at all . I just had this stupid thought the other day in humanities . Johnson was saying something idiotic , as usual , and I just started to watch him carefully for the first time talking to us , you know , thirty kids who think he 's a prick , and I realized that he probably thinks all of us are pricks and I just started to wonder what we 're all doing . You know what I mean ? What the fuck are we all doing , seriously , tell me , I 'd really like to know in twenty-five words or less No , no , sorry , come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the letter , Bob . BOB What letter ? ( Kathy takes an official letter out of her bag ) Kathy , where did you get that ? Come on , give it here . KATHY We 're supposed to be like all together in here . If you ca n't say it yourself , I 'll say it for you . ( Bob is momentarily confused , then realizes that Kathy thinks he was trying to tell everyone about the letter . He finds the situation absurd , annoying and funny. ) p. 33 BOB Kathy , that letter has nothing to do with anything and it 's none of your business and would you please give it back ? ( Kathy , hands the letter to Ruth . Ruth reads . ) RUTH Oh , fuck . ( Ruth hands the letter on . Each reads in turn . It ends in Mike 's hands . Bob waits impatiently as the letter makes its round . He 's embarrassed and then begins to find it funny that everyone , especially Kathy , has construed the letter as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . ) BOB ( Laughing it off ) : It 's just for the physical . I mean , I 'm not dead yet . ( As Bob says this , something amusing passes through his mind and he stops talking . Mike is looking at the letter again . The others watch Bob . ) MIKE They misspelled your name ? BOB ( Comes out of his brief daydream ) : Huh ? MIKE Jobert . BOB ( Amused ) : Oh , yeah . MIKE Jobert Rettie . Dear Jobert Rettie . Hi , Jobert . BOB Hi , Jike . MIKE Good old Jobert. p. 34 COOTIE How ya feelin ' , good old Jobert ? BOB Dead , how ' bout you ? MIKE ( Sees what 's happening and comes to the rescue . Pause ) : Hi , Jel . COOTIE Hi , Jike . MIKE Hi , Jorman . NORMAN Huh ? MIKE Hi , Jorman . NORMAN Oh , hi . MIKE Hi , Jathy , hi Jick . DICK Fuck off . MIKE Juck off ? Why should I juck off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and answers it . At the door , a young man in a suit and tie and hornrimmed glasses , with an attach case , which he has concealed just out of sight behind the doorframe . ) COOTIE Hi , Jister . MIKE Ask him his name , Jel . COOTIE What 's your name ? RALPH Ralph . COOTIE Hi , Jalph , I 'm Jel and that 's Jathy , Jorman , Jike , Jick , and Job , and we 're just on our way down to City Hall to beat the shit out of some cops . Wan na come ? p. 35 RALPH ( Pauses momentarily , then launches his pitch ) : I 'm from the University of Buffalo and I 'm in the neighborhood doing market research . You do n't mind my asking you a few questions , do you ? ( As he says this last , he reaches down , takes up his concealed attach case , bends his head like making ready for a dive , and advances swiftly but deliberately into the middle of the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to force the average housewife to back away and give ground , but since Cootie merely steps aside when Ralph bends down for his attach case , we are treated to the entire technique out of context . Ralph ends up in the middle of the room still bent over , motionless . He looks up and around and straightens himself , laughing nervously at everyone watching him ) Do all you people live here ? MIKE No , we 're just using the place for a few days . This is a fantastic coincidence because the guy that lives here just went away for a few days to do a series of special guest lectures at the University of Buffalo . RALPH Really ? No kidding ? That 's some coincidence , huh ? That 's really a fantastic coincidence . Well , ahhh , here 's what I 'd like to do . I 'd like to interview one of you people . I 'll choose one of you at random and everybody else can listen and if the guy I choose has a particular opinion that differs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll just stop and take a consensus , O.K. ? Hey , you guys all work , do n't you ? I mean , you 're not students or anything ? p. 36 COOTIE We mostly hold various government jobs . RALPH I see . Are any of you married ? RUTH I 'm married to him ( Mike ) and she 's married to him ( Bob and Kathy ) . BOB Actually , we 're getting a divorce . RALPH Oh , I 'm very sorry . BOB ( Very sincerely to Ralph ) : No , please . It 's just , I 've been dying for a while , nothing serious , you know , but now I 've decided I 'm definitely dead , you see , so I 'll have to change my name . It 's a legal technicality . We 'll marry again under my new name . Jobert . ( Pause ) Job . RALPH Oh well that 's certainly very unusual . Now this is going to get a little difficult , really . I 've got to improvise some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , you know , it asks things about your children 's opinions and that would hardly apply in a case like MIKE I have several kids by a former marriage . RUTH Hey , how come you never told me about that ? MIKE If you remember , dear , we did discuss it . p. 37 RALPH Can I just edge in here , I mean , ha-ha , I do n't want to interrupt a little marital tiff or anything , but , ha-ha , you know . ( To Norman ) And how about you sir , do you have any children ? NORMAN I do n't have any children . I 'm not married . RALPH Well , sir , I would guess , am I right , I would guess that you are the oldest person staying here . I only mean that in the sense of responsibility . Am I right ? MIKE The guy that actually lives here is older , but he 's not here right now . RALPH No , he 's lecturing , right ? I remember , ha-ha . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . Have you ever heard of a teaching program called the World Volumes Encyclopedia ? DICK Hey , are you selling encyclopedias ? RUTH Hey , yeah , are you trying to sell us a set of encyclopedias ? RALPH I 'd like to make it very clear that I am not authorized to sell any product , I 'm merely doing market research . MIKE Jesus Christ , he 's not even selling the fucking things . You go and write to the central offices and you wait for a whole year to hear from them and when they finally decide to send a guy around he 's not even authorized to sell you a set . I 'm not hanging around here listening to a guy that is n't even authorized to sell the World Volumes Encyclopedia while millions of women and children are dying out there in Vietnam . ( He grabs the banner and starts huzzahing as everyone follows him out of the door . Dick and Norman stay behind with Ralph , who is yelling after them ) p. 38 RALPH Hey , hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want one . ( He turns to Dick and Norman ) Hey , do you guys really want to buy a set of encyclopedias ? I can sell you a set . I got a number of deals and there 's a special discount for government employees . DICK ( To Norman ) : You going ? NORMAN Yes , I 've been reading a lot about it lately . DICK You want to come with me ? NORMAN Well , yeah , if you do n't have any other plans . DICK O.K. , hold on a minute . ( He goes out the hall door ) RALPH Hey , who are all you people ? NORMAN We just live here . RALPH I go to college . I do n't really come from Buffalo . I live in town . I 'm trying to earn some money in my spare time . Are you guys really government employees ? NORMAN I 'm a graduate student . RALPH Yeah , well , I did n't want to say anything , but I did n't really think you guys were government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 39 RALPH I wanted to study mathematics . My father said he would n't pay so I 'm studying law . Boy , do I hate law . I 'm living at home . Do you guys all live here together ? NORMAN Yes . RALPH And and the girls too ? NORMAN Yes . RALPH Oh , boy , what a life , huh ? I 'm gon na get me a car pretty soon . I 'm saving up . The thing is , I 'm not really doing too well selling encyclopedias . I ca n't pull it off . I wish I could figure out why . I 've been thinking about it and I think maybe it 's because I ca n't give the sales pitch credibility . That 's pretty bad if I 'm gon na be a lawyer because a lot of the time you have to defend people you know are guilty . The thing is , these encyclopedias are really shitty . ( He blushes ) Sorry . I mean , you know , they 're not very good . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pea jacket and well-laundered jeans . He wears a large , orange Day-Glo peace button . ) DICK You ready ? RALPH You going out ? DICK Listen , if you 're gon na eat anything , lay off the hamburgers O.K. ? ( Dick and Norman start out. ) p. 40 NORMAN I do n't see why he has to go saying he 's dead . I mean , that 's only for him to have a physical . It 's pretty easy to fail a physical . I 've heard of guys that pretend ( They are gone . ) RALPH ( Alone , looks at the open door ) : Hey ! ( Blackout. ) @x A few hours later . Kathy is sitting in the kitchen , upset . Ruth comes in the front door . She has just returned from the march . RUTH Bob here ? KATHY No . RUTH Hey , what 's wrong . You want some coffee ? KATHY Please . ( Ruth takes off her coat and starts making coffee ) How was it ? RUTH Were n't you there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coming . You were on the bus and everything . I got lost when the cops charged . Boy , they really got some of those guys . Fucking pigs . KATHY When we got there he said he did n't feel like marching . RUTH Why not ? KATHY Oh , Ruthie , I do n't know . I do n't know anything anymore . You devote two years to a guy and what does he give you ? He never even told me about the letter . Drafted , and he did n't even tell me . RUTH He 's not drafted . The letter 's for the physical . All he has to do is act queer . They 're not gon na take a queer musician . p. 42 KATHY That 's what I told him on the bus . He would n't even listen until I called him Job . RUTH What ? KATHY He said he was dead . " Bob is dead . " RUTH He 's putting you on . KATHY That 's what I mean . Me . He 's even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done for him , Ruthie . Shit , I sound just like my mother . You know what I mean . I 'm not complaining , but you know , you get tired of giving all the time and nothing 's coming back . You know what I told him ? I said he was the first guy I ever had an orgasm with . I mean , it really made him feel good . Now I got ta live with it . How can you explain something like that . RUTH Hey , no shitting around , did he really say he was gon na join ? KATHY You know what he told me ? He thinks the whole antiwar movement is a goddamn farce . I mean , Jesus , I really thought we were relating on that one . It 's not like I 'm asking the guy to go burn himself or anything but , I mean , he knows how I feel about the war and he 's just doing it to be shitty . There 's something behind it , I know that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me on the personal level by rejecting me but , like , I do n't know how to break through . He says he 's gon na study engineering in the army and then when he gets out he 's gon na get some kind of plastic job and marry a plastic wife and live in a plastic house in some plastic suburb and have two point seven children . Oh , shit , Ruth , it 's all too much . He went to a cowboy film . p. 43 RUTH Well , you know , that 's how it is . KATHY But Ruth , it 's not like a fantasy scene . I know the guy . He 'll go through with it . I mean , he really thinks he 's serious . He does n't see it 's all part of a communication thing between him and me . RUTH I do n't know . Like , maybe he 's really serious . Mike 's got this thing about physics . His tutor says he 's a genius . O.K. , maybe he is , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's gon na end up working for his old man in the lumber business . It 's all laid out from the start . You have to fit in . KATHY You do n't want him to do that , do you ? If the guy is into physics you 've got ta really stand behind him and make it all happen for him . RUTH I do n't know . You have some kids and everything . I mean it 's not like you ca n't have a meaningful life if you get married and have kids . KATHY Wow , I do n't believe you really mean that . RUTH Look , Kathy , I do n't want Mike to saw wood for the rest of his life , but what can I do about it ? Why should n't he get into wood ? Like , what if he does physics for the rest of his life and he 's a genius and ends up head of department at some asshole university ; you find out one day he 's being financed by the C.I.A . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need you , so you go away and they freak out . Mike is a really brilliant guy . I mean , we all know that . You could really do things for him if you tried . You should 've seen Bob when I first met him . RUTH I did . KATHY He used to compose all this really shitty music and like when he did something good he did n't even know it . You had to keep telling him yes , it 's good , it 's really great . A whole year it took for him to believe it . He 's writing some fantastic stuff now , ever since , you know , I told him he was the first guy . RUTH Yeah , and look at him now . KATHY ( Upset again ) : You think you 're really relating like crazy and then , I do n't know , it 's a whole new scene . It 's like you do n't even know him anymore . RUTH Maybe you ought to stop relating so hard . KATHY You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy and he needs me . RUTH Yeah , but maybe you ought to lay off for a while . ( Mike bursts in through the front door . ) MIKE Holy shit , where were you ? RUTH I got lost and came home . p. 45 MIKE Christ , it was horrible . We got stopped by this line of cops . Me and Cootie were right up front so I told him we should get everyone to join hands and stand still . We 're standing there and this one pig starts running toward Cootie and you know how he gets when he sees pigs and he always gets diarrhea . I do n't know , he should have said something , but he got the urge so bad he started to run , you know , trying to find a toilet , and this dumb pig thought he was trying to resist arrest . KATHY Is he all right ? MIKE They took him to the hospital . He 's , I do n't know , they said he 'll be all right . He got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COOTIE Boy , what a shitty march . You had to go and get separated with all the eats . I could 've really used a marmalade and chunky peanut butter . RUTH Hey , did you know , Bob really wants to join the army ? He 's not even gon na try and get out . He did n't even go to the march . COOTIE He did n't miss much . KATHY He went to a goddamn cowboy film . COOTIE Hey , is that the one with Kirk Douglas and Gina Lollobrigida and Curt Jurgens and Orson Welles and Tom Courtenay and p. 46 KATHY You guys are really something . You do n't give a shit what happens to him . I thought we were , like , all together here . Smug bastards . I 'll tell you something . COOTIE What 's that , Kathy ? KATHY You 're no better than the people fighting this war . ( She storms out of the room down the hall ) MIKE She 's pretty cut up , huh ? RUTH She thinks he 's serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and singing , punctuating each note with a leap . He snarls the song . ) COOTIE We shall over cu  --  u  --  um , We shall over cu  --  u  --  um , We shall overcome some day  --  ay-ay-ay-ayOh , oh , oh , deep in my heartI do believe.We shall over MIKE Shut up , Mel . COOTIE If Bob 's really serious , we got ta stop the war quick so he does n't get sent over there to get killed by an antipersonnel bullet . ( Dick comes in , livid . ) DICK Fucking Norman is fucking out of his fucking mind . That 's the last time I ever take him with me . ( Dick takes a bottle of milk from the icebox , kills it , and places it on the stack ) p. 47 MIKE Hey , what 's the matter , Dick , did n't you get yourself some left-wing ass ? COOTIE Do n't be ashamed , sonny . If she 's waiting out there in the hallway , bring her in and show us the goods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a fucking revolver to the march . MIKE Is he a good short ? DICK I 'm not shitting around . We 're sitting on the bus and he 's telling me he 's reading Ho Chi Minh on guerrilla war and he does n't think marches are effective . So he says he 's gon na use the marchers like an indigenous population and start a guerrilla war against the cops . I mean , I thought he was just fucking around . You know Norman . Then he pulls out this fucking revolver right there on the bus , people looking and everything , and he says he 's gon na get a few cops and would I help him create a diversion . He 's out of his fucking mind . MIKE How many 'd he get ? DICK Fuck you . COOTIE He got the girl , huh ? DICK Where 's Kathy and Bob ? RUTH Bob 's not here . DICK Kathy here ? RUTH Leave her alone . She 's upset . p. 48 COOTIE Yeah , I would n't try to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Bob . ( Dick walks out down the hall . ) MIKE That was a pretty stupid thing to say . COOTIE Just came out . RUTH Who cares ? Everyone knows what dirty Dicky 's up to . Except maybe Bob . MIKE And maybe Kathy . RUTH Kathy knows . COOTIE Do you think a guy could become a homosexual just by willpower ? Could someone learn to like guys ? ( A knock on the front door . ) RUTH It 's open . ( In walks Lucky , the downstairs neighbor , led by Mr. Willis , the landlord . ) WILLIS Lucky tells me there 's been a lotta noise up here . Is that right ? MIKE Sorry , Mr. Willis , we had a little outburst up here . It 's my fault . I just got a letter my sister had a baby . COOTIE We were celebrating . WILLIS That 's all right , but keep it down . Lucky here was saying how you woke his wife up . She 's a very ill person . I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about that , Mr. Willis , I 'll take it on myself to keep this place really quiet . LUCKY Listen , I told you kids once before , and I 'm not telling you again . You got ta get rid of those galvanized aluminum garbage cans in the yard and get plastic ones like everyone else . RUTH ( Angry ) : I do n't see why we ca n't keep the ones MIKE Ruth , now calm down , Ruth . I 'm sorry , Lucky , but Ruth 's pretty upset . Her father 's fallen ill and they do n't know for sure if it 's you know . LUCKY You got the galvanized aluminum ones out there . You 'll have to get rid of the galvanized aluminum ones and get plastic . WILLIS I 'll take care of the rest , Lucky . Thank you for bringing this particular grievance to my attention . LUCKY I 'll give you till Monday , then I want to see plastic out there . ( He leaves through front door ) WILLIS Whew , I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' but complaints day and night . The guy was born with a hair across his ass . So who 's gon na give the landlord a little coffee ? ( Ruth makes a move to get it. ) p. 50 WILLIS Thanks , sweetheart . Brother , what a day , what a stinker of a day . Where 's Bobby ? MIKE He 's dead . WILLIS Dead ? He 's dead ? You guys really kill me , you guys . You got a whole sense of humor like nothin ' else . Dead , huh ? Smart kid , Bobby . Hey , you been to the march ? COOTIE Yep . WILLIS Great march . I watched it on Channel 8 in color . Brother , clothes you guys wear come out really good on color TV . You know , that guy Lucky can be a lotta trouble . He got a mind , like , you know , the size of a pinhead , you know what I mean ? Just one sugar , sweetheart . MIKE You want the rent ? WILLIS Rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting along and you talk to me about rent . How many landlords care , tell me that ? One in a million , I can tellya . Hey , you decided whatya gon na do when you get out of college ? COOTIE I 'm gon na be a homosexual . WILLIS A homo You guys really slay me , you guys . What a sense of humor . You know , I 'd give ten'a my other tenants for any one of you guys . You kids are the future of America , I mean that deeply , not too much milk , beautiful . Yeah , you kids live a great life up here . I got tenants complaining all the time about the way you kids carry on , and I 'll tell ya something , you wan na know why they complain ? ' Cause they 'd give the last piece of hair on their heads to live like you kids are living . p. 51 RUTH How 's Mrs. Willis ? WILLIS Huh ? Oh , yeah , great , just great . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gettin ' to be a pain in the ass . She wants me to get rid of you , too . Why ? I ask her . She do n't like the way you live . O.K. , I say , if you know so much , how do they live ? She do n't know and she do n't wan na know . I try to tell her , you know , about the wild parties and stuff and taking drugs to have all new sensations in the body and the orgies with six or seven of you all at once . You should see her eyes light up . Same thing with all the tenants . When they hear what it 's really like up here they go all funny . They 'd pay me a hunnerd dollars to hear more , but they ai n't got the nerve to ask . " Get rid of them . " That 's all I hear . Wamme to tell you something ? MIKE If you got something to say you did n't ought to hold back . WILLIS Tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors try to tellya about when they was young do n't believe it . It 's a lotta bull , and I should know . When we was young it was so boring you fell asleep when you was twenty and you never woke up again . You hear them stories Lucky tells about the war ? Crap . He 's sittin ' down there holdin ' his dick watchin ' Doris Day on television . He 'd give his left nut to know what 's happenin ' up here . This is the best cup of coffee I 've had all day . I got a theory about it . It 's when the head and the stomach do n't talk to each other no more . That 's when everything goes to hell . I 'm gettin ' so I do n't know what I want half the time . I got these dreams , really crazy dreams . I got this one where I 'm in a clearing , you know , it 's right in the middle of the jungle and there 's this tribe of Africans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're Africans but they 're livin ' in the jungle and they 're black so I figure they must be Africans . They got this skin . It 's , you know , black , but really black . This maybe sounds kinda screwy , but it 's really beautiful this skin . It 's a dream , remember . I 'm not sayin ' black skin is beautiful , if you see what I mean . I 'm in charge of the whole works in this jungle and I got it all organized so the men live in one hut and the women live in another hut and there 's a big sort of square in between where nobody 's allowed after lights-out . They live like this all their life . There 's no marryin ' or anything . I 'm a kind of witch doctor and I got this tribe believing well , you know , they 're just , like , Africans , and they do n't know you got ta have a man and a woman to make babies , and I got ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl 's thing and hits the inside of her womb . And I got this whole ceremony where a girl comes to me when she wants a baby and I tell her she got ta wait until it gets dark and the moon comes up . Then I tie her to a plank , face up , and tilt the plank so her thing is facing the moon and then I go to the hut with the guys inside and get one of them to jerk off on a leaf , you know , one of them tropical leafs that 's really big . Then I roll this leaf up like it 's a tube and I sneak across the square holding this leaf in my hand all rolled up , until I get to the girl . She 's lying there in the moonlight all black and shiny and her thing is opened right up ' cause she thinks and I got this tube full of jis in my hand , and I 'm coming closer so I can smell everything and ( Comes out of it ) Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's just a dream , what I 'm telling you . p. 52 RUTH That 's the most beautiful thing I ever heard . WILLIS Listen , I got carried away . I did n't mean none of that . MIKE Mr. Willis , if you'd 've had the opportunities we 've had you'd 've probably ended up one of the great poets of the century , and I mean that includes Rimbaud , Rilke , Williams , Pasternak and Ginsberg . COOTIE And Whitman . MIKE Yes , Whitman included . WILLIS Oh , Jesus , you kids , you kids . I feel like I can tell you anything . Somebody could 've thought I was pretty screwy if I told them some of them things . RUTH How many landlords have poetry in their soul ? WILLIS Yeah , yeah . Hey , I got ta run now . Listen , it 's really great having you guys around . If I could get some of them other tenants to come up here and listen to you , the world would be a better place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be a much better place . COOTIE A hundred percent better , at least . RUTH You 're a beautiful person , Mr. Willis . Never be ashamed of it . WILLIS No , I ai n't . I ai n't ashamed of myself . Hey , you know what I was sayin ' before about all them complaints . I lost a lotta tenants on account of you . I ca n't afford any more , so keep it quiet or I 'll have to get rid of you . Wonderful coffee , sweetheart . Seeya . ( He leaves through front door ) p. 53 RUTH I wonder how long before they put him away ? ( Kathy , clothes a bit messed up , flounces into the kitchen and gets a glass of water . Dick follows her as far as the kitchen , as if he was trying to stop her , but when he gets to the doorframe he stops , feeling the tension in the room . He tries to button his shirt casually , not sure whether he wants the others to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COOTIE Hi , Dick , how 's it hanging ? ( Kathy stiffens at the sink . Dick turns and goes down the hall out of sight . ) MIKE I still ca n't figure out what to get good old Bob for Christmas . ( Before Kathy can reply , the doorbell rings . No one moves . ) COOTIE Whose turn is it ? KATHY You 're a miserable bastard . COOTIE What 'd I say ? We 're just playing a chess tournament . KATHY Listen , this is my scene , mine . You guys stay out of it . O.K. , Ruth ! RUTH It 's her scene , guys , you stay out of it . COOTIE Roger . MIKE Sam . COOTIE Larry . p. 54 MIKE Richard . COOTIE What 's Richard getting Bob for Christmas ? ( The doorbell rings again , and Mike jumps up to get it . Shelly 's standing there . ) MIKE Hello there , I do n't know you . SHELLY Hi . Does Norman live here ? MIKE Does anyone here know a Norman ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the march today . He said to come here and wait for him . I been standing out in the hall ' cause , like , I heard someone talking and I did n't want to disturb anyone and then this guy just came out so I figured , well , it 's now-or-never kind of thing . I 'm Shelly . RUTH Come on in . I 'm Ruth . SHELLY Oh , good , then Norman does live here because I was n't sure when he gave me the address . Sometimes you meet a guy at a march and he 'll like give you an address and you end up waiting for a few days and he never shows . Did that ever happen to you ? It 's happened to me a lot of times . KATHY Listen everyone , I 'm serious , I do n't want him to know . I 'll tell him when the time 's right . RUTH It 's your scene . ( Kathy exits down hall . Shelly , meanwhile , goes under the table and sits down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . If you want to laugh go ahead , I 'm used to it . It 's just I 've got this thing at the moment where I keep sitting under tables and I figured I 'd better do it right away instead of pretending for a while I did n't sit under tables . I mean , sitting under the table is " me " at the moment , so why hide it ? Have you ever done it ? RUTH Want some coffee , Shelly ? SHELLY I 'm a vegetarian . MIKE Coffee 's made from vegetables . SHELLY I do n't drink coffee , thanks . I 'll just wait for Norman . COOTIE Where 's Norman ? SHELLY Well , he was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon , but he said it 's O.K. because he has a permit . He 's really a total-action freak , and he 's very committed to the whole peace thing . COOTIE Oh . MIKE Well now COOTIE How about that ? ( Fade out. ) @x Norman is trying to read . Shelly is under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MIKE I still think you should 've said something , Norman . I mean it 's got nothing to do with putting you on . If Dick said we did n't have a cat , all right , I mean he 's got a right to think that but , I mean , it 's really irresponsible of him to go running all over the place saying we do n't . NORMAN Well , you turned off the lights that time when you came in . I was trying to read . MIKE Yeah , but that was the nitty-gritty , no-nonsense , down-to-earth needs of the moment because a cat just wo n't give birth with the lights on . NORMAN Dick says you do n't have a cat . MIKE Will you listen to what I 'm trying to tell you ? COOTIE You ca n't move there . MIKE Why not ? COOTIE Mate in thirty-four . MIKE Shit , I did n't see that . O.K. , you game . ( Mike and Cootie start rearranging the pieces ) COOTIE Yeah , you see , Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do n't have a cat or something like that . We would 've explained if you 'd just come out and asked instead of getting all hostile and paranoid and thinking we were putting you on . p. 57 SHELLY Wow , bubbles are really something else . I think they 're maybe divine . MIKE Bubbles are divine , Shelly . COOTIE So 's Bogart . SHELLY Oh , Bogart , wow . COOTIE You 're pretty happy , are n't you , Shelly ? SHELLY Oh yeah . Like , it 's the right foods . And being under the table . MIKE You got ta watch the paranoid thing , Norman . NORMAN You were putting me on about the cat . MIKE See , you got this very paranoid thing about the cat . NORMAN I have not COOTIE And the worst thing is how you get all defensive about it every time we bring it up . We 're not denying your validity to doubt , Norman . We 're not rejecting you as a human being . It 's just you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means you grew up in a very paranoid atmosphere . SHELLY Wow , your father 's a cop ? NORMAN Well , you know SHELLY You never told me that . I think that 's really great . My brother always wanted to be a cop . p. 58 COOTIE My uncle 's a cop . MIKE Yeah , that 's right , our uncle 's a cop . NORMAN That 's what I mean , you see MIKE What do you mean ? NORMAN Well , I mean , you 've got to go making fun of my father being a cop . MIKE Look , Norman , it just so happens our uncle is a cop and why the hell should you be the only one around here with a cop in the family . You see , you got paranoid again , thinking we 're putting you on . I mean , we could do the same thing . How do we know your father 's a cop ? We do n't . We trust you . COOTIE Yeah , and if you'd 've been more outer-directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . A lot more than you ever expected . MIKE Then maybe we could 've prevented that whole tragic episode with the gun . NORMAN Yeah , well , I do n't know about you guys . MIKE You 're not trying to say it was n't a tragic episode ? COOTIE It was an abortion of academic freedom , pure and simple . MIKE Hear ! Hear ! COOTIE I mean , when they can kick mathematics graduate students out of school just for trying to murder a few cops And , by the way , Norman , I 've heard that your being kicked out of school was the doing of the Dean of Admissions , a man who is known far and wide to be cornholing his widowed sister in the eye-sockets regularly p. 59 MIKE And without love . COOTIE And when the moon comes up he ties her to this plank MIKE Mel COOTIE So put that in yer pipe and smoke it . And do n't try to tell us you enjoy having to schlepp down to the Hays Bick every night to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I do n't know . SHELLY Hey , are you guys brothers ? MIKE Now there , look at that , Norman . Shelly 's wondering about the relationship between Mel and me , and instead of being all paranoid about it and going crazy wondering , she comes right out and asks . SHELLY Hey , are you ? COOTIE Yeah , we 're brothers . SHELLY Wow , I did n't know that either . I keep learning all these things about you guys . MIKE See , everything 's cool now . Everybody trusts each other . That 's what it 's all about . NORMAN Well , I mean , with washing dishes I get more time to read . I 've been thinking a lot and I guess it 's like Dick said . I was pretty irrelevant before . Mathematics is pretty irrelevant no matter how you look at it , and bad mathematics is about as irrelevant as you can get . p. 60 SHELLY I left school after the first month . I 'm not saying I 'm really relevant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school are really into bad scenes . School is evil . You ca n't find out where it 's at when you 're studying all the time to fit your head into exams . I 'm getting to where I can read recipes all day and really get something out of it . NORMAN Yeah . I 'm learning all this stuff about Vietnam . It 's really something . I mean , I 'm getting to the point where maybe I can do something really relevant about it . MIKE I would n't call the gun business relevant . NORMAN I was still in school when I thought of that . SHELLY Norman 's got this fantastic idea . NORMAN Well , I have n't thought it all out yet SHELLY No , Norman-baby , do n't like close all up . It 's the most relevant thing I ever heard of . COOTIE Jesus , Norman , how long have you been walking around with this idea all locked up inside you ? NORMAN I did n't get it all at once . It sort of came in stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man , you 're gon na go crazy if you keep everything inside like that . p. 61 SHELLY Tell them the idea , Norman . NORMAN Well , you see ( Pause ) I 'm gon na set myself on fire as a protest against the war . ( Cootie and Mike look at him and exchange brief glances ) I 've thought about it a lot . I mean , I 've read I guess about a hundred books about the war and the more you read the more you see it 's no one thing you can put your finger on . It 's right in the middle of the whole system , like Dick said . I shouldn't 've tried to kill those policemen , but I did n't know then they were part of the system like everything else . No one 's got the right to take anyone else 's life , that 's what I 've decided . But I 've still got the right to take my own life for something I believe in . SHELLY I 'm gon na burn with Norman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it all through and , like , if he burns himself alone that 's just one person . Everyone 'll say he 's insane , but if two of us do it wow . Two people . What are they gon na say if two of us do it ? MIKE ( Pause ) : Three of us . COOTIE Four of us . MIKE You , too , huh ? COOTIE It 's the only way . NORMAN Hey , wait a minute . I 've read a lot about the whole subject and I really know why I 'm gon na do it . I 'm not just doing it for fun or anything . You ca n't just jump into it . p. 62 MIKE Listen , Norman , you do n't have to believe this if you do n't want to but it 's the truth , on my honor . Me and Cootie talked about the exact same thing a year ago . We were all ready to burn ourselves COOTIE It was more than a year ago . MIKE More than a year ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right , a year and a half , boy , time really goes quick COOTIE It sure does MIKE The thing is , we decided against it because we figured two is n't enough . COOTIE You know how the papers can lie . " Brothers Burn ! " MIKE Yeah , " Hippie Brothers in Suicide Pact . " That kind of shit . COOTIE But think of it . With four of us ! NORMAN You really want to do it ? MIKE It 's the only way . NORMAN I mean , I was n't sure yet . I had n't made up my mind definitely . I was still looking for another way . SHELLY No , Norman-baby , it 's the only relevant gesture . Like you said . ( A long pause while Norman thinks. ) p. 63 NORMAN O.K. ! COOTIE After the Christmas vacation . MIKE No , no , after graduation . We 'll study like mad and get fantastic grades and graduate with honors so they ca n't say we were cracking up or anything . COOTIE Yeah , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them say we 're insane when two Phi Beta Kappas go up in flames with the son of a policeman and the daughter of a Hey , what does your father do ? SHELLY Well , it 's kind of funny . I mean , he 's a pretty weird head in his way . He 's got , like , six or seven jobs at any one time . COOTIE That 's O.K. Daughter of a weird head with six or seven jobs at any given time . That covers the whole spectrum . NORMAN What does your father do ? I mean , I know your uncle 's a policeman because I trust you , but you never said what your father did . I was curious . Like if they bring our fathers into it what 'll they say about you ? COOTIE He 's a trapper . SHELLY Wow , that 's really something else . Like a fur trapper ? MIKE Furs and hides , you know . Rabbit and mink and muskrat and beaver and elk and reindeer and seal . Some otter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you know , he works the Great Northwest Territory up to the mouth of the St. Lawrence Seaway and over to the Aleutians . SHELLY Boy , this 'll really blow everyone 's mind . MIKE Yeah , this 'll make everyone think twice , all right . COOTIE You know , we ca n't tell anyone about this . If word gets out they 'll send squads of police around here and we 'll get arrested and put under psychiatric observation and subjected to a battery of tests that make you look nuts no matter how you answer . NORMAN I wo n't say anything . SHELLY Oh , wow , like you do n't even have to worry about me . NORMAN I did n't even know there were any trappers left . ( A knock on the door . ) MIKE Come in . VOICE C'm on , c'm on , open up in there . ( Mike opens the door and finds two cops standing there . Bream is elderly and Effing is young . ) BREAM You live here ? MIKE Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and who else . p. 65 MIKE Well , there 's me and my brother Cootie um , Mel , and there 's Norman , Dick , Bob , Kathy and Ruth . BREAM Kathy and Ruth , huh ? Those are girls ' names . MIKE Kathy and Ruth are both girls , sir . BREAM Do n't block the doorway . ( Mike stands aside as Bream and Effing enter . Effing wanders around the room , inspecting . Bream indicates Shelly ) Which one 's she ? You Kathy or Ruth ? SHELLY I 'm Shelly . BREAM Shelly , huh ? You did n't say nothin ' about no Shelly . MIKE She does n't live here , sir . BREAM Visiting ? SHELLY I 'm with Norman . BREAM You 're Norman , huh ? NORMAN She 's my girlfriend . BREAM Good , we got that straight . EFFING Hey , Bream , this here 's a map of Europe . BREAM Yeah . Now listen . There 's been a complaint from the people across there . I know you kids are students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I got some news for you . There 's laws around here and you got ta obey them just like everyone else . p. 66 MIKE We appreciate that , sir . EFFING Hey , Bream , look at all them milk bottles . BREAM Yeah . Now listen . I do n't want to hear any more complaints about you guys . I 'm a reasonable man , which is something you can get verified by askin ' anyone on the force , but when I got ta put up with a lotta stupid complaints I can cause trouble and I mean real trouble , with a capital T. EFFING Hey , look at all them dishes in the sink , Bream . BREAM Yeah . NORMAN What was the complaint ? BREAM What do you mean , what was the complaint ? The complaint was guys and girls parading around in here bare-ass . Now look , I 'm not the kind of dumb cop that goes around throwing his weight everywhere to prove he 's some kind of big shot . I do n't need to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what I do n't know , and one of the things I know I do n't know is what the hell the kids are up to nowadays , but O.K. That 's my problem . If you wan na run around naked that 's O.K. by me , and I hope you kids take note of the fact that I 'm winking one eye when it comes to the law about cohabitation . MIKE We appreciate that fact , sir . It was the first thing we noticed . p. 67 COOTIE I sure appreciate it . I think I can speak for Norman and Shelly , and if any of the other guys were here they 'd appreciate it a lot . MIKE I mean it 's not as if we underestimate the life of a cop . For chrissakes , I mean , our uncle 's a cop . His father 's a cop . A lot of us around here are pretty close to the world of cops . BREAM You got cops in the family ? EFFING Hey , Bream , look at this heater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what you guys have to put up with . It can be pretty crappy job . BREAM I do n't know MIKE I 'm not saying it does n't have its rewards . My uncle 's life is full of rewards . His father 's life is very meaningful . BREAM Yeah , that 's what I mean . ( Cootie gets up and starts to leave the room . ) EFFING Hey , Bream , the kid 's leaving the room . COOTIE I got a call from nature . BREAM That 's legit . You go ahead , kid . ( Cootie goes out the front door. ) p. 68 EFFING Hey , Bream , the kid says he 's going to the euphemism and what if he 's got some stuff on him or something . He can flush it down and come back clean . BREAM He 's O.K. EFFING Jesus , Bream . Sir . BREAM The guy 's new on the job . He do n't know the score yet . MIKE You know how some people exaggerate . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe , like after a shower we 'll come in here to get an anchovy snack or chocolate milk or something , and we forget to put something on EFFING Look at that , Bream , the girl keeps sitting under there BREAM Goddamnit , Effing , who 's in charge around here ? EFFING But she 's sitting under there BREAM Did we come here to investigate a complaint about a girl sitting under the table ? EFFING No , sir , but BREAM The girl happens to be well within her rights as a tax-paying citizen of the community to sit under any table she wants , and until we get complaints about her sitting under there , we leave her alone . Understand ? p. 69 EFFING Yeah , yeah , yeah SHELLY Thanks . BREAM That 's O.K. , lady . The kid 's a rookie . They give us pros a bad name . Now let me tell you something about the people complaining about you . They look in here and see you guys bare-assed and they 're complaining because they 're so sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you . We know about them people . They 're strict Roman Catholics . Twelve kids in four rooms . The old man ca n't keep it in his pants for ten minutes running . So they got troubles , right , and everyone that 's got troubles wants to give troubles to someone else . So they make a complaint , and that 's well within their rights as lawabiding citizens of this community . I got enough troubles without their goddamn complaints . I got enough to do watching the Vietnam freaks and the niggers and the loonies going up on buildings with high-power rifles picking off everyone down below . Let me give you some good advice . Get curtains . They got some fiberglass curtains at Woolworth 's , you ca n't tell them from real cotton . Twelve dollars and fifty cents a pair and they come in eight colors , plain and patterned . You get some curtain rods for a dollar sixty-nine apiece and for a total of twenty-eight dollars and thirty-eight cents you save yourself from a lot of crazy neighbors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get some gingham , thirty-nine cents a yard at Penney 's . Measure your windows and allow a foot extra at each end . All you got ta do is take up a three-inch hem at each end , fold it over once , and hand-stitch . A couple of curtain rings and you 're in business . Can you remember that , or d' you want me to write it down ? p. 70 SHELLY Hey , yeah , would you do that ? ( Bream takes out a notebook and starts to write . Effing is nervous . ) EFFING The kid 's been gone a long time . BREAM I got eyes , Effing . EFFING Yeah , yeah , yeah , O.K. BREAM ( Writing ) : So , what are you kids gon na do with yourselves ? ( Pause ) Am I being nosy or something ? MIKE No , I mean , there 's a lot of opportunities all over the place . We 're not jumping into anything without we 've looked the whole thing over . BREAM Smart kids . Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to college . They must pay him pretty good , huh ? NORMAN I guess so . BREAM Yeah , what 's he a sergeant lieutenant or something ? NORMAN He 's Chief of Police for Erie County . BREAM ( Whistles ) : Whew ! Pretty good . That shut me up O.K. Chief of Police . Oh , boy , that 's really something . NORMAN It 's just his job , you know . p. 71 BREAM Look , ah , here 's your instructions . I want them up by Wednesday . Any complaints after that and all of you guys 'll be in court , father or no father , you understand me ? This ai n't Erie County . MIKE Yes , sir . NORMAN O.K. COOTIE ( Returns and stands in the door . There 's a pause ) @x Ruth is scraping some cat food into a bowl . A cat comes in and eats . Ruth keeps glancing at her watch . RUTH **29;1662;TOOLONG . Chomp , chomp . Good girl . Make a lot of milk for the kitties . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a chair . ) KATHY Oh , Jesus , Ruth , how am I ever gon na tell him ? RUTH Who ? KATHY Bob , for chrissakes . Who else ? RUTH Well , how should I know ? KATHY I never slept with Dick . I know you got the idea I did , but it 's not true . He never got all the way RUTH O.K. KATHY Yet . ( Pause ) I 'm not saying I would n't like to . RUTH So go ahead . KATHY Well , do n't try to pretend it does n't mean anything to you . You know as well as I do it 'll kill Bob if he ever finds out I 'm even thinking of sleeping with Dick . RUTH That 's how it goes . KATHY Ruthie , look , we 've known each other since freshman year . I can tell when you 're thinking something . This is really a big decision I 've got ta make . What am I gon na do about Bob ? I mean , it feels like maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guy . I really like him a lot and I respect his music . But I know he could never relate to me as a friend . It 's got ta be tied up with sex . I mean , Richard really seems to dig me , but I do n't know . He 's pretty together . He 's not the kind of guy you could really do something big for . Not like Bob . p. 73 RUTH Oh , for shit 's sake , Kathy , Dick is a fucking parasite . KATHY That 's not fair , Ruth . RUTH Fair ! Do you know what that guy 's doing to get into graduate school ? You ever heard of Professor Roper in the Eastern Studies department ? KATHY He 's Dick 's adviser . RUTH Yeah , and he also happens to be queer as a three-dollar bill , and Dick is fucking his wife to keep her quiet so good old Roper can suck cock with all those graduate students from Thailand or Malaya , or whatever the hell they are . KATHY Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whole goddamn school knows about it . " Dirty Dicky . " KATHY That 's why ? RUTH Yeah , what else ? I mean , the guy washes eight times a day . KATHY Oh , man , how long have you guys known about this ? I mean , why did n't anyone ever tell me ? You ca n't just let him screw up his future like that . Has n't anyone tried to do anything about it ? RUTH Like tell him Mrs. Roper 's got clap ? KATHY Ruthie , the guy must be really suffering . p. 74 RUTH Oh , shit , Kathy , let 's not have the big savior thing . KATHY That 's not very funny . RUTH Look , we 're all gon na graduate pretty soon , and we 're all gon na go away , and probably we 'll never see each other again except maybe like at Christmas or something . So why do n't you worry about yourself and never mind about Dick and Bob . They 'll be O.K. KATHY Boy , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You sure have changed . ( Bob comes through front door carrying books . ) BOB I do n't believe it . It 's incredible . You know what happened today in counterpoint class ? Remember I was telling you about Eric Shatz ? RUTH three armpits ? BOB The very one . KATHY ( Nicely ) : Bob ( Bob , who has gone to the icebox to steal some of Dick 's hamburgers , stops short in whatever gesture he is holding , only for a moment though , just long enough to cut Kathy . When he resumes his story , he is talking only to Ruth , who is wrapping a Christmas present . ) BOB Today Shatz turned in this perfect , spotless , clean counterpoint exercise . I mean , for someone as filthy as Shatz , that 's a miracle . They say his high-school yearbook voted him " The Most Likely to Attract Infectious Disease . " ( Bob has the hamburgers out by now . Kathy , being all nice , takes the hamburgers from him , indicating that she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth ) He picks his nose and squeezes his pimples right there in class , and his counterpoint exercises have to be seen to be believed . He writes them in pencil , and if he makes a mistake or something , he spits on his eraser and rubs the paper about a hundred times per note , so by the time he hands it to Professor Bolin , it 's just this gray sludge with lots of little black things swimming around on it . Anyway , about a week ago , when Shatz handed over his work , Professor Bolin put on a pair of gloves before he 'd take it , so Shatz must 've got the message and this week when Bolin called for homework , Shatz set this beautiful , clean exercise down on the piano . We could n't believe it . Bolin just sat there staring at it , and we all sat staring at Bolin , and after about ten minutes , no shit , it took that long , Bolin turned to us and said , " Free will is an illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KATHY Bob , can I talk to you ? BOB ( Ignores her ) : The thing is , Bolin 's got a Ph.D . He 's also written two books and a couple of hundred symphonies and string quartets and they say he taught himself twenty-two languages in four hours or something KATHY Please , Bob , I want to talk to you BOB And another thing , Bolin 's wife got drunk at a faculty party for the music department last year and she yelled , " Fuck Schberg , I wan na dance , " and then she went and laid the only black professor in the school , which all goes to show that when Bolin tells you free will is an illusion you better believe it . KATHY ( Pointed ) : Bob , I would like to talk to you BOB Hey , Ruth , did I ever tell you the one about the guy that died and came back to life as Job ? KATHY Oh , do n't start that shit again . BOB Again ? It started over a month ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , he still makes me walk around the music building every time I put down parallel fifths , but that 's how it goes , life is trying at the best of times , every cloud has a silver lining , a stitch in time saves nine p. 76 RUTH ( Looks at her watch ) : I 've got ta go . BOB Did I say something ? RUTH No . Kathy wants to talk to you about sleeping with Dick . KATHY Ruth bitch ! ( Ruth goes out the front door , grabbing her coat on the way . ) BOB ( Pause ) : Meanwhile , back at the ranch You 'll never believe this , but when I came in just now , I did n't expect that . Bedbugs , maybe . Thermonuclear war KATHY She had no right . BOB I 'm trying to think of something appropriate to say , like " Name the first one after me . " That 's Job . J-O-B . Job . KATHY Please , Bob , can I say something ? BOB Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ , you 're impossible . BOB Ah , yes , but I exist , nonetheless . KATHY You 've just cut me right out . You 're not even trying to relate to me anymore . ( Pause ) Well , you 're not . BOB No , Kathy . The fact is , I like you a lot . I , um , sort of love you , if you know what I mean . p. 77 KATHY I do n't really want to sleep with Dick . BOB Then do n't . KATHY It 's just , he tried to get me that night after the demonstration . BOB I know . He told me . KATHY That shit . BOB I thought it was pretty good of him . KATHY He never got into me , you know . BOB That 's nice . KATHY Oh , Bob . I 'm sorry . BOB If Bob were around I 'm sure he 'd forgive you . KATHY What 'll we do ? BOB What do you mean ? Like study or something ? KATHY Bob , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? BOB Between us , you mean ? KATHY Yes . BOB If that 's what you want . KATHY Of course I do n't want it . I love you a lot . BOB O.K. , so let 's study for Phil 720 . KATHY Oh , for chrissakes , show some emotion . I do n't know where I 'm at with you half the time . p. 78 BOB Look , what 's the big hang-up ? If you want to stay with me , O.K. If you want to move into Dick 's room , go ahead . If you do n't know for sure , stay one night with me and one night with him till you start feeling a definite preference for one of us KATHY Jesus Christ , Bob , what 's the matter with you ? BOB I 'm Job . Bob 's dead . KATHY ( Is in a furious slow burn . She stands and goes toward the hall door ) : All right all right ( Before she can exit a knock on the door stops her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door ? Bob picks up a book and starts reading . Another knock . Kathy sighs . She 's above these silly games . She opens the door on a middle-aged man in well-cut coat . A businessman from head to foot . This is Murray , Bob 's uncle . ) MURRAY Hi . Does Bob Rettie live here ? BOB ( Looks up from his book ) : Murray ! ! MURRAY Can I come in ? BOB What the hell are you doing here ? MURRAY Guy flies a couple thousand miles to see his nephew , maybe he can come in , huh ? BOB Yeah , yeah . Come in , come in sit down p. 79 MURRAY Hey , I bet you 're surprised to see me , huh ? Maybe a little happy . BOB Yeah , I mean I have n't seen you for a couple thousand years or something . MURRAY ( To Kathy ) : It 's longer than that since he wrote . BOB Oh , ah , that 's Kathy . My uncle . MURRAY How do you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk , huh ? BOB Yeah . ( They laugh . ) MURRAY Where 'd you get that goddamn icebox ? BOB Oh , you know MURRAY Is this the way you been living ? Bobby boy , why did n't you tell me . Write a letter , say Murray I need a little cash , I 'd 've sent you some money for a decent refrigerator . BOB Murray , we 're living O.K. MURRAY So . I 'm sorry for breathing . Did I interrupt something ? BOB No . Nothing at all . MURRAY Are you two ah BOB Yeah  --  Murray , look , sit down , take your coat off p. 80 MURRAY Hey , Bobby , Bobby-boy . You got long hair BOB Yeah , it keeps growing . MURRAY Still proud , hug ? ( To Kathy ) Just like his mother ( Murray looks at the two of them and shrugs ) Well what can I say ? KATHY Look , I think I 'll BOB How long you in town for ? MURRAY Oh , you know . Business . KATHY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids ? MURRAY Oh , fine , fine , keep asking about you . BOB Auntie Stella ? MURRAY Oh . You know . We got a new house BOB Great . Where you going , Kathy ? KATHY ( Has been edging toward the door . Quietly ) : I 'll be in Dick 's room if you want me . ( She exits ) MURRAY Is she O.K. ? BOB ( Flat ) : Yeah . It 's her time of the month , you know . p. 81 MURRAY Say no more . You do n't have to tell me about that . Nice girl . Very nice . ( Laughs ) So BOB Come through New York ? MURRAY Yeah , you know , passed through . BOB You passed through New York , huh ? MURRAY ( Uneasy ) : Yeah , sure , you know BOB D' you see Mom ? MURRAY Yeah , yeah , sure . She 'd maybe like a letter every now and then . Your own mother . BOB It 's not like that , Murray . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : Jesus Christ . ( He removes a shiny metal hip flask and drinks ) BOB You O.K. ? MURRAY Sit down , Bobby-boy . BOB I 'm O.K. like this . MURRAY I got something to tell you , you should maybe be sitting down when I tell you . ( Bob sits . Murray pulls his chair close and takes Bob 's head in his hands . Bob is stiff . ) MURRAY Bobby-boy , oh , Bobby . I 'd like to see more of you . Me and the family . You maybe come out and visit , huh ? p. 82 BOB ( Flat ) : What 's happened , Murray ? MURRAY How am I supposed to tell you ? ( Pause . ) BOB ( Long pause ) : Cancer ? ( Murray nods ) How long 's she got ? MURRAY A week , two weeks . I do n't know . Any time now .

MURRAY I thought I thought maybe you and me fly to New York tonight . BOB Yeah , get in there quick for the payoff . That 'll be just great . MURRAY She does n't know yet . BOB Yeah , " Hi , Mom , I just came flying in with Murray a couple of weeks before Christmas vacation to see you for no good reason . " You think she wo n't guess ? MURRAY We can always tell her something . BOB You planning to keep it from her , too ? I bet it 's the first thing she thought of . Two years . She had that first operation two years ago . She 's been dying for two years and I did n't even fucking know it . p. 83 MURRAY I do n't want to hurt anybody . BOB ( Pause ) : I 'll pack some stuff . No , you stay here . I want to be alone . ( Bob goes down the hall . Murray sits . Very short pause , then Mike and Cootie burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They see Murray , cross the kitchen to the hall door , exit , and start arguing loudly just outside in the hallway . After a moment they reenter , Mike leading .

KATHY Look , I went to the bathroom , O.K. ? SHELLY Ya did n't flush . KATHY Mind your own business , Shelly . What does he expect me to do ? How can I make plans for the Christmas vacation if he just shit , he could 've said something .

I mean , he can be pretty shitty . MIKE They say he shot a man in Abilene . COOTIE In the back . RUTH Listen , willya ? I went into his office and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and everything . I thought he was probably gon na ask why I was n't doing any homework , and I had this whole speech worked out about how I thought he was a pretentious little snot and how I frankly did n't give a shit about philosophy and even less of a shit about him , if that 's possible and oh , you know , I was really going to kill him . Anyway , he told me to come over to the window , so I came over and we both stood there looking out . Snow everywhere , like , white wherever you looked and a lot of snow coming down like in those paperweights you shake up , and there 's all these kids down below coming out of the building , all little lumps moving across the white in slow motion , and we 're looking at them , just the two of us for , I do n't know , about a minute or two , and then he just turns to me , like without any warning , and says this incredibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see the nifty present we got ya ?

He pulled me in after a tutorial and gave me the old " Richard , my boy " speech . He thought I started the rumor . Me . Shit . " Richard , my boy , it 's said you 're doing unenviable things to my wife . My boy , that particular assignment has already been well seen to . It 's not like you to claim credit for someone else 's work . " You ever tried to do a paper for someone who thinks you 've been saying you 're screwing his wife ? Shit .

Oh , well , good luck and , you know , when you see your mother say hello for me . BOB O.K. KATHY How is she ? BOB She 's okay . Sort of dead . KATHY I like her , Bob . You 're lucky . She 's , you know , she 's a real person . BOB No , she 's you know , a real corpse . KATHY All right , have it your way . BOB No , it 's not what I wanted particularly . No , taken all in all , from various different angles , I 'd 've preferred it if she lived . I 'm pretty sure of that . KATHY ( Pause ) : She 's not really ? BOB School 's over . KATHY Bob , do you know what you 're saying ? BOB Kathy , please get the fuck out of here . KATHY But , I mean , Ruth never told me Did n't you tell anyone ? BOB Yeah , I just told you . KATHY But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no , it was the day after . KATHY ( Sits ) : Jesus , Bob , why did n't you tell anyone ? I mean , how could you live for six months without telling someone ? BOB ( No emotion ) : Oh , I do n't know . A little cunning . A little fortitude . A little perseverance . ( Pause ) I could n't believe it . Not the last time anyway . They put her in this room . I do n't know what you call it . They bring everybody there just before they kick the bucket . They just sort of lie there looking at each other , wondering what the hell they got in common to talk about . I could n't believe that anyone could look like she looked and still be alive . ( Pause ) She knew . I 'm sure of that . ( Pause ) Once , I remember , she tried to tell me something . I mean this noise came out of somewhere around he mouth , like somebody running a stick over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to tell me something . So I leaned over to hear better and I caught a whiff of that breath . Like fried puke . And I was sick all over her . ( Pause . Brighter ) But you want to know something funny , and I mean this really is funny , so you can laugh if you like . There was this lady dying next to my mother and she kept talking about her daughter Susan . Well , Susan came to visit the day I puked on Mom . And you know what ? It was only Susan Weinfeld , which does n't mean anything to you , but she happens to have been the girl I spent a good many of my best months as a sophomore in high school trying to lay . In fact , her virginity almost cost me a B plus in history and here we were , six years later , staring at each other across two dying mothers . I want to tell you something , Kathy . She looked fantastic . And I could tell she was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scene does n't happen every day . It was like ( thinks ) it was like how we were the first time . Maybe , just possibly , a little better . So we went out and had a coffee in Mr. Doughnut and started groping each other like crazy under the counter , and I mean we just could n't keep our hands off each other , so I suggested we get a cab down to my mother 's place since , you know , there happened to be no one there at the moment . But the funniest thing was when we get down to Mom 's place and you know all those stairs you have to go up and there 's Susan all over me practically screaming for it and I start fumbling around with the keys in the lock and none of them would fit . I must 've tried every key about fifty fucking times and none of them would fit . Boy , what a drag . ( Pause ) Oh , we got in all right . Finally . I had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , up the fire escape , and through Mom 's place , but when I opened the front door , guess what ? There 's poor old Susan asleep on the landing . She really looked cute . I hated to wake her up . Anyway , by the time we 'd made coffee and talked and smoked about a million cigarettes each we did n't feel like it anymore . Not really . We did it anyway but , you know , just to be polite , just to make some sense out of the evening . It was , taken all in all , a pretty ordinary fuck . The next morning we made plans to meet again that night . We even joked about it , you know , about what a super-fucking good time we 'd have , and if you ask me , we could 've probably really gotten into something incredible if we 'd tried again , but when I went to the hospital I found out good old Mom had croaked sometime during the night , and somehow I still do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan again . And vice versa . It 's a funny thing , you know . At the funeral there were all these people . Friends of Mom 's  --  I did n't know any of them . They were all crying like crazy and I well ( Pause ) I never even got to the burial . The car I was in broke down on the Merritt Parkway . Just as well . I did n't feel like seeing all those people . I 'd sure love to have fucked Susan again , though . p. 115 KATHY Bob I BOB ( Abstract ) : Anyway I just did n't feel like telling anyone . I mean , I was n't all that upset . I was a little upset , mostly because I thought I ought to be more upset , but as for your actual grief , well . Anything interesting happen to you this semester Kathy ? ( Kathy has risen ) Going ? ( Kathy is going out the door ) Give my regards to that guy you 're rescuing at the moment ; what's-his-name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanders in from the hallway ) Hey , cat , what are you doing hanging around here ? All the humans gone west . ( Puts the cat outside and shuts the door . He nudges the tiles with his toe and looks around at the empty room ) Hey , guys , guess what happened to me ? I want to tell you about this really incredible thing that happened to me ( He is faltering now , choking slightly , but he does n't know he 's about to crack . His body is doing something strange , unfamiliar ) Hey , what 's happening ( He 's crying now ) Oh , fuck , come on , come on . Shit , no , no ( Fade. )
