Alongabout Maryland the accents started . Before kit , there had been only the usual bored grunts and one unexpected " Thank you " from the people who take your money on the Verrazano and the Goethals , the Jersey Turnpike , the Delaware Memorial . But now , in Maryland , we needed gasoline , and we were confronted again with people other than ourselves who were something more than machines . The two men in the gas station leveled their eyes at me . Their faces were red and their necks were wrinkled like the tongues of old Army boots ; there were Wallace stickers all over their faces ; their uniforms were oil-company green , and they probably wore them cat fishing on weekends too . There was meanness in their eyes , hating me for having a beard and tan British boots and a New York license plate . **25;2582;TOOLONG , their eyes said , " Faller-rup ? Pream-yurn aw ragler ? " There was nothing else to do but put on my own accent a little . It is a facility , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they enjoy using from time to time , especially when talking to Negroes in the North and rednecks in the South . " Yeah , faller-rop with prearn-yum , aim sure preciatet if you 'd check th batrywater too . " The men in the Maryland gas station were surprised , which is what I meant them to be , and in their momentary defensiveness and my momentary assertiveness , we reached a tentative compromise . What I was saying was I 'll buy your gasoline if you 're decent and courteous to me . Otherwise , I 'll do something violent like ram your gas pumps on the way out or turn in my credit card with a three-page letter explaining why , because I out from . the South , too , from the same violence you are , so please do n't let the beard and the license plates fool you . Then it 's okay . They have been civilized just enough by television , by the Interstate Highway System , by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. by being beholden to a large impersonal corporation owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards , and by the intense personal desire tomake money . They pumped the gas and checked the battery water and their eyes said nothing more . I continued on my way home to North Carolina . I am going home out of obligation and love . There is an obligation to let the grandfather see the grandchild and to observe , a little earlier each trip , that they , too , are growing apart . They do not avoid each other ; they simply spend less time together now . When Polly was four or five we would go home and he would take her by the hand and walk around the block , showing her off to all the neighbors . " Yes , this is my little granddaughter from New York , " he would say . Now they meet after the long drive and it is apparent that they have less in common than before . She is eleven years old now , and full of half-conscious fragments of thoughts about propriety and about male and female , and she has long periods of completely un-childlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , respectful of him , as never before , But she also turns her head ever so slightly to the side when they kiss . And he walks not so well now , being close to eighty ; the days of going around the block are gone forever . I am also going home to look for things , things I never bothered with before . I know now that something I always knew ? the fact that I was adopted ? is far more important to me than I had ever before admitted . If you do not know who they are , and most important if you do riot know why they gave you away , and you have no reason to believe that you ever will know , then a lot of questions are raised and never answered and a lot of time is wasted . All I know is that I was born in Nash County , North Carolina . I have often toyed with the idea of going to Nashville . the county seat , and asking for the honk that shows who was horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize myself . There was a cold , dirty rain falling in New York and the air along the turnpike was even grayer and more foul than usual , and it was difficult to tell a lien the rain had ended . We started late in the day and drove through the night . There was a piece of filler in the Times once that said spring was moving through Siberia at the rate of 35 miles a day . I wondered if the rate was the same for the Eastern United States . It is all expressway and toll road from near our house , in Brooklyn , to Petersburg , Virginia , and from there to Raleigh it is mostly old U.S. 1 . We passed through Henderson , North Carolina , as the sun was cooling up , and I woke them and told them to look out the window . The rain had stopped for good , and we bad passed into spring . Everything down to the edge of the asphalt road was green and wet with dew , not rain , and the flowers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall and lean black men who had waked hours before , out there in their shirtsleeves , coaxing mules and already well into their first sweat . I have lived in the city for seven years now , and seven years is a long time to be locked in combat with society . If you live in New York for that length of time , and you are neither very rich nor so poor that you have completely given up hope , the chances are that you are in combat with it a good deal of the time and that you are pretty fed up with it all . It was , always before , the logical place . There was , of course , a variety of logical places for my generation . the Silent one . For many of us , there was a fascination for politics that Northerners , after the Longs , Orval Faubus , Strom Thurmond , and George Wallace , still can not understand . Some of those who left Chapel Hill when I did , in 1957 , returned home to Winston-Salem or Statesville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the proper time , to take over their fathers ' automobile dealerships or feed-and-seed empires or law practices . They kept their eyes on the state legislature , and some of them have made it there already , and some of them are keeping their eyes on the governor 's mansion now , and undoubtedly at least one of them will make that , too . Some of those in my generation went to Washington under the spell of John Kennedy , and they stayed to learn some lessons in practical polities from Lyndon Johnson . When Johnson learned his lessons in practical politics , they went to work for foundations and universities , and certainly they will surface again some day . But the rest of us , those of us who were not tied to politics , had to go to New York . We went there because it was the only place to go . We wanted to act , or to " communicate , " or to write . We had been reared in a stale that considered itself , rightly , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school that had good reason to believe it was the best , too ? of its region . So when we left , we put in quick apprenticeships elsewhere and then we headed straight for the city , because that was the only place to go if you wanted to be ? had to be ? the best of them all , and not just the best of a region . Now , as we all know , New York has become irredeemably , irretrievably rotten . The nation is finding out how difficult it is to live in the cities , and the inmates of New York , being in the most difficult of all cities , are finding out quicker and more . And so , for the past year or so , I have been half-seriously entertaining the thought of giving up the struggle , selling the beautiful old house in Brooklyn , and moving to a place where the air has a few more years to go ; where one can see farther than a block ; where there might be something worth seeing , farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and where a heavy snowfall might be considered a work of art and not a catastrophe of such magnitude that its perpetrator has to be sought out and publicly condemned . And maybe I could become a Southern Writer : that should not be too difficult . Often at dinnertime we would talk about this thought , but we never came to any firm conclusions , except to agree that it might be nice but that it also had its drawbacks . Every time we went to Raleigh , we recalled , we had a built-in baby-sitter and almost unlimited time and energy and enough money to have a little fun , but when we scanned the ads we found that there was nothing at the theaters but Elvis Presley movies and after the show there was no place to go . Not only , however , is it absurd to pretend that by remaining in New York you are really executing a conscious decision to stay and fight ; there is nothing , literally nothing , that an individual citizen can do that would make New York more livable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the mayor . You soon learn to question your own motives for staying : are you really demonstrating your belief in cities , your faith that large groups of people can live together in peace , or are you some kind of masochist ? It just might be that the courageous thing to do would be not to stay and fight , but to recognize and admit that the battle has got too corrupt ; that courage could be demonstrated only by leaving , retreating . fleeing . And it just might be that such a town as Raleigh . North Carolina , my home , whose advantages and limitations I know well , should be the place to flee to . Qfitting on the ground in the backyard . feeling LYspring all around , doing nothing more complicated than picking up tiny pine twigs and thumping them into the air : it was early morning , and all around there was a steady buzz , like June hugs on a string . A neighbor was mowing his yard . The noise stopped , and 1 realized that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as early as I did ; no noise has come to mean that something is wrong , what getting a telegram used to mean . A jet passed over , 30.000 or so feet above , and I could hear it distinctly . As my ears adjusted to the new sounds , and to the absence of old ones . I realized that the neighbor had started up his lawnmower again . Here , I thought , a man can spend an entire day , several days , a week , doing nothing more profound than working on his yard and he can feel as if he has done something useful . There is a little road 5$ next to the house that until a couple of years ago was dirt : it is of no use to anyone except those eight or ten families who live on it . Twice , in maybe a minute , cars passed up it . My sister said , " It 's just like Grand Central Station out here today . " I got up off the springy ground . I had places to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see or look for again One of the people , a relative , asked me if I had ever met Robert Ruark , the writer . I had , once , when he came to Chapel Hill in a fancy car and impressed everyone . He was said to have gone to his old fraternity house for a drink ( real saloons being illegal in North Carolina , then and now ) , to have expressed dismay at the condition of the wooden bar , and to have written a check for a new one on the 51101 . Yes , I said . I had met Robert Ruark the Writer once . " Well , " said the relative . " I 'm from Southport , and you know Robert Ruark the Writer was from around there , and let me tell you , there are some people there who do n't think highly of him at all after what he did to them . You know , he wrote a book about all that , and some of the people in it , if you were from there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was who . " I changed the subject . and I wondered if this lady knew that I was in Raleigh to write about it ; and if , after I did it , anybody there would be able to understand that I did it out of love , or perhaps out of a feeling of obligation , or because I was looking for something . R aleigh is a city , now , of more than a hundred ( thousand people , and I suppose the people at the Chamber of Commerce think of it as " bustling . " Raleigh is the stale capital , a city of white-collar workers , and it always has looked down on Durham , 26 miles away , because they had industry in Durham , and the people there were generally considered by Raleigh people to be dirtier , meaner . and dumber When we were looking for some violent action on weekends , we would go to Durham in convoy , in our fathers ' cars , and pick fights wilh the boys from Durham High . They were always stronger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirtier , meaner , and dumber , and they always won . The most profound insult any of us could imagine would be the knowledge , or even the suspicion , that one of our girls who was widely thought to be saving it for marriage had given it to a Durham High boy . In addition to the legislature and the state offices , hich Raleigh was and is about as proud of as a city can he of its politicians , they had State College , which then was the school to go to to learn agriculture and animal husbandry and engineering , and which was just getting started as a center of architectural design ; they had a nondescript baseball team ; two well-thought-of whorehouses ; several Negro colleges ( one of the reasons I am proud of Raleigh . when I am proud of it , is that Shaw University is there , and Shaw played a part in the origins of the sit-in movement ) ; and a number ofsatellite country towns , places like Cary arid Knight-dale . Apex and Fuquay Springs . Those towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neuse , New Hope and Bunn and Pearces . Every Saturday the people from all these towns , black and white , would pour into Raleigh on the blue-black roads that Governor Kerr Scott had built for them , and they would all go to Montgomery Ward 's and Briggs ' Hardware to spend their money quickly and then , while the women were looking at dresses in Hudson-Belk 's , the men would lounge around in the public squares , the whites in their square and the blacks in theirs , all of them very unself-conscious in their faded blue overalls . There was some drinking . whiskey in the white square and Catawba grape in the black one , and , by eight or nine o'clock on Saturday night the emergency rooms would be full of the victims of stabbing and shooting wounds . I worked weekends as a police reporter on the News and Observer , while I was going to Chapel Hill , and I quickly learned the subtle differences among the various forms of Saturday-night violence . What was called , then , in newspaper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigger cutting " meant a slashing , usually with a razor blade held rigidly between the stiffened first and second fingers , just below the fingernails . You wiped it across your victim 's face and chest . Wounds inflicted by such weapons produced enormous amounts of blond and gave the doctors untold trouble when they had to sew them up , but they left the victim relatively unharmed and ready , after at most a transfusion , to leave the hospital and return to the battle . He was scarred for life , however . I never learned what the whites did when they wanted to temporarily maim a victim , but their favorite weapon for serious arguments seemed to he a shotgun aimed directly at one 's head . The women of both races , when they were really angry , preferred to throw a pot of lye , the hotter the better , into an aggressor 's face or upon her breasts . The nice , white , middle-class , white-collar people of Raleigh looked upon these Saturday night bloodlettings , and upon the people who participated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except when they got too close to a sweaty , unbathed farmer in Hudson-Belles basement and had to move quickly away in disgust . Not complete disgust , however ; for the white-collar people , the bustlers , were not so far removed from Cary and Knightdale themselves . Now the farmers still come in on Saturday , some of them , but they are more difficult to spot . because they no longer wear overalls . They wear permanent-press pants and white shirts and they drive Mustangs and Camaros because they watch television , too , and they do not all congregate in the public squares downtown because downtown is pretty much dead . Most people go to the shopping centers now , and some of the shopping centers are being built far from downtown , even in Cary and Knight-dale . Raleigh itself , as a whole , has slipped a notch or two . The Interstate Highway System just seems to have bypassed Raleigh in favor of the hated Durham , and when they were deciding on the big regional airports , Raleigh did n't get one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had that was hyphenated with Durham . There is not much in the way of television . There are some nice , clean , comfortable theaters I people do not urinate in the aisles and masturbate on the seats , as in New York ) , but they tend toward inferior and certainly uncontroversial movies . Fayetteville Street is in bad shape . Montgomery Ward 's is no longer there ; Woolworth 's and Briggs ' Hardware are , and so is the little newsstand operated by a blind lady and which sells eighteen to twenty New York Timeses a day , but a lot of the street is loan companies and empty department stores with " For Rent " signs in the windows , and from the amount of dust on the signs , it looks as if they have been vacant a long time . Inside Briggs ' Hardware , there was Mr. Briggs , looking no different than he looked twenty years ago , and he remembered me . " I would have recognized you sooner , " he said , " if it had n't been for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Others have said things like that and meant them as devastating put-downs , but he did not say it in meanness . ) " Yon know , I get up there fairly often , and I think Lindsay 's doing a pretty good job . It 's too bad all the abuse they 're putting on him . " Mr. Briggs said he heard , from time to time , about our generation and what we were doing . " You know , " he said , " a lot of you kids did okay . 0-Fay . I 'm proud of you . " Back in the rear of the store , the sacks of rabbit food he used to sell were no longer there . Mr. Briggs said he could n't remember if they ever had been there . I had remembered the Capitol square as a green and shady place , cool in the heat of the summertime , funky and damp with tall old trees and statues . The soil was the sort that , if you could dig into it , you could collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing had changed . Clouds of pigeons departed every few seconds from one corner of the square for another , occasionally changing direction in mid-flight and heading for , and some landing on , the man who sells peanuts . Across from him , at the main entrance to the square , was the man who sells jonquils wrapped neatly in wet newsprint with a rubber band around each bunch , exactly as before . There was a coin-operated newspaper rack beside him ; the Raleigh Times was saying that day : SCORES or THE FAITHFUL MAKE PILGRIMAGE FOR CHHIsT It was the Friday before Easter . And there was another headline : FIRST ANNIVERSARY : THOUSANDS LAUD KING It was , also , the anniversary of the death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr . Not far away there was my favorite statue , " To the North Carolina Women of the Confederacy . " It was a woman and her young son . She sits , holding an open book , and he stands by her side , holding a sword . too young to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look ! you see it often anywhere in the South and on the faces of soldiers in airports ) W hen you live in the East , you are shocked . sometimes , by what you see and hear when you venture out into the United States of America . even though you are from there and really should not be shocked at all . The people look strange . I used to be almost apologetic about the way I looked when I went home . There was something shameful about my appearance , in turtleneck shirts and with my beard and my tight pants and pointy Italian boots . This time , it was they who looked strange to rue . One becomes accustomed to seeing short skirts and long , flowing hair , and sexy false eyelashes and naturally rounded and bouncy breasts , and it is shocking to go to a place and see that practically no impression has been made by all the expensive pages of cosmetic advertising in Life and all the microskirts and magnificent cleavages on the Carson show . The skirts are at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious that they still wear girdles and falsies , and the hair is still teased up at the top of the head and held there by great doses of hair spray and it looks , except for the color ( and sometimes that . tool like wands of petrified cotton candy . The white women are made up like dead people . as if they do not want to look pretty . Perhaps they are afraid to look pretty , or maybe it is just that the competition is nonexistent , or insufficient . hi New York , there is plenty of competition . and a woman who might he plain or fat finds it necessary to do something about it . Here , in Raleigh , and in a thousand places like Raleigh . if a woman looks competitively pretty , if she looks as if she enjoys seducing and being seduced . she might find herself labeled " too forward , " or taken for a whore . The men wear baggy pants and nondescript shirts and unexciting plaid sports coats , and they 57 look as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they arc afraid that there is nothing behind their zippers , as if they feel themselves incapable of growing their hair long for fear that someone will make an invidious comparison between them and their wives , the girls they went to high school with . The only ones who look natural are the Negroes . The Negroes in Raleigh look much the way they look in New York and Atlanta and San Francisco , which is to say they carry and dress themselves according to the way they want to carry and dress themselves . For the young , it means bright and exciting clothing ; the girls wear shorter dresses than whites their age , and they tended , at Easter time , toward neat , tightly belted trench coats . For the not.so-youig , there is some of that three-hutton tweedy business one sees on the black teller in a bank up North , but for what seemed to be all of them , there is an obvious lack of fear , an obvious willingness to dress the way that makes them feel good . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the street corners in the neatly mowed white sections in the afternoon , waiting for the bus that will take them to Fayetteville Street so they can transfer to the bus that takes them to their side of town ? they look wise and majestic , not with their heads down ( the whites have their heads down much more ) , but with their heads up high , looking unbeaten , never going to he beaten , everybody I had seen was far higher than back in New York . All around us were old couples , and widows and widowers , and groups of old women in flowery hats . There were young people here , too , but even they looked like part of the geriatric community in the way they talked and walked and dressed . I wondered if I were exaggerating all this ; if I was purposely searching out , and confining myself to , the old people of Raleigh . Did Faulkner purposely confine himself to the white trash community of Mississippi ? Where 's a lot going on here , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months before . " Things are n't as dead as you might think . " And his wife told my wife that it might be wrong to judge the ladies by the length of the skirts they wore in Cameron Village , the big shopping center . They were much shorter in the North Hills shopping center , she said . There is a Raleigh there that 1 have not even mentioned , of course , a new Raleigh that swings and does not hide its liquor in brown paper bags and that has a jazz joint named The Frog and the Nightgown . The Raleigh I talk about may be hopelessly outdated , moribund. perhaps already dead and gone . There are people whose company just transferred them to Raleigh and who were horn and raised in , say , St. Louis . and who never saw . never see , and never will see the things and people and places I am trying to describe . ) W e went out to dinner at the K &; W Cafeteria at five o'clock in the afternoon because my father does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in another booth , sat a man with his wife . They did not speak more than a dozen words during the entire meal . She was thin , almost gaunt , perhaps forty years old but looking five years older ; there was evidence of pain , suffering , anguish on her face , and there was evidence there , too , of the farm , of Garner and Cary . He must have been the same age , but he looked younger , with a brown plaid jacket , a black tie , a brush haircut . Four times during the course of the meal he got up and walked over to a little table that held the coffeepots and he walked back to the booth and refilled their cups and then returned the pot . lie walked slowly , surveying the people around him , perhaps to see if they were looking at him . He almost minced . There is so much about the Southern white male that runs dangerously close to effeminacy . It is in the shy way they hold themselves , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the way they talk . The couple in the booth were obviously terribly angry , angry at each other , but it was also obvious that this was not a temporary anger . It was a very long-term anger , one that started a long time ago , in Garner or Cary or Knightdale . I looked around the room . and suddenly I realized that I had been living for ! his past few days in a geriatric community . The median age of There is a scandal at one of the churches . Members of the congregation are said to have been consulting mediums . The scandal in Raleigh is always so minor , or pathetic , or both . A woman is quoted as saying , every time one sees her how much responsibility she has and how her husband is just plain lazy . " And let me tell you : she sure runs that family . " A man was an alcoholic , became reformed , and is now slipping again . " He never was anything . " A young man 's recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there are ladies present . He seems to have had difficulties with his appetites for drink and women . " Yes , " was the sympathetic reply , " but he went to Chapel Hill . " There is talk about a family picnic on Easter afternoon , with all the aunts and uncles and cousins and their already grown babies . One of the cousins warns me , good-naturedly but with the utmost sincerity : " You folks can go back to New York , but / have to live here . So please do n't bring beer to the picnic . " The Sanitary Barber Shop , which is below the sidewalk , and which I remember as being a Saturday-morning place where you went only to get a crew cut , and where the air was heavy with talk of niggers and poontang , with both subjects being discussed mostly in violent terms , has a sign up now which says that it does razor styling . N AThen I was a childin Raleigh , there were three V main ways to leave . One of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. 1 , and the third was the train station . The bus station is almost completely black now , except for the drivers and the others who make their living by the uncomfortable transportation of people of moderate means . There were only two or three whites when I walked in , and they were soldiers . Otherwise the station had changed not at all . Outside , there were Trailways and Greyhound buses labeled " Miami " and " New York City " and " St. Petersburg Express " and " Asheville . " I asked a driver how many of the people who got on the bus marked " New York " went all the way to New York . " Right many of them get off at Petersburg and Richmond , " he said , " and a lot of the rest get off at Washington . " U.S. 1 used to be wonderful and unattainable for me . We were told that it stretched from Maine to Florida , and Raleigh was in the middle of it . Standing beside U.S. 1 and watching the traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost as exciting as going down to the train station . The people I saw there had been in New York earlier Mai day , or they had left Miami two days before . They had style , the mystery of foreigners . Our eyes met briefly as they passed through with their foreign license plates , the trucks belching and snorting and whining up and down through the gears , dozens of gears. and you knew that they would be driving all night , and when the sun came up tomorrow they would be in another place . Now U.S. I is difficult to find , for there are other and better highways passing through and around Raleigh that are a good deal busier , and much of the traffic from New York to Florida bypasses the city entirely . On the way down , in Maryland , we had left the toll roads briefly to look for a place to eat and I had dris en . instinctively , to U.S. I , certain there would be at least a Howard Johnson 's there . There was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junkyards and specialists in the reconstruction of transmissions . And there were Negro motels . Empty , for-sale Negro motels . " Hotel ? Colored , " said the signs . Next to that , they said , " For Sale . " When the Silver Meteor leaves New York City , I suppose , it is just another train . different from the commuter trains only in that its cars are silver rather than dirty brown . But when it came through Raleigh in my youth , that was something else . We used to go down to the station just to see the Meteor , which went from New York to Miami , come through . or to see its sister trains , the Comet and the Star . I remember the air of the people who were riding those trains ? urbane , sophisticated , looking down on Raleigh as if it were a hick town . The only Negroes who did not shuffle and lower their eyes in the presence of whites back then were the cooks on the Meteor , the Star , and the Comet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a full five feet higher than those of us who stood on the platform , looking down on us yokels , looking so infinitely more sophisticated and superior , and we , even the most ardent white supremists among us , dared not say a word . Now , the Meteor bound for Miami comes through at 12:20 in the early morning , and the northbound Meteor comes through five minutes later . The Comet passes through Raleigh at 9:20 in the evening , and the Star comes at 7:40 P.M. I went down to see the Comet one night . It was raining , and the railroad station looked HO gauge , where in my memory it had been a huge place , full of busy people and gray mail sacks and carts with long-spoked wheels , and green Railway Express trucks . But now it was not only smaller ; there were practically no people there . The waiting rooms were empty ; there were two or three men at Railway Express . The chalked arrival and departure times on the big blackboard ? what few remained ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comet came in , its head lamp swiveling wildly as before . but it was a tiny train , no longer than the BMT subway ? two Diesels to pull it . two mail and express cars , two coaches , and one Pullman . It used to have a diner and as many as eighteen cars , cars with fancy exotic names on their sides , but now the cars have numbers . Almost all of the passengers were Negroes this time . Those who were n't were elderly whites , apparently too scared to fly , who were being put on or taken off the train by their middle-aged children . And since the middle-aged children had children of their own who were grown or off at school , there were no real children at the station that night to see the Comet come in . Steam poured out of the undersides of the silver cars . Somebody ignored the notice in one of the rest rooms and flushed the toilet in the station , and a brief torrent of water and urine splashed down on the tracks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go from New York to Birmingham , and we used to ride it over part-way and connect with a little steam locomotive that would take us down to Opelika to visit my father 's people and their farm .

" And they 're about to cut it between Richmond and Washington . Pretty soon there wo n't be anything at all . They cut the train and they cut the diner and pretty soon now they 're going to cut the train out all-together . Right now , nobody but the disagreeable people 'll ride it . " He inclined his head toward a group of Negroes . There was more steam . and somebody flushed another toilet . and the train moved unceremoniously out of the station .

T he cemetery is in the old part of town , and it is covered with hills and tall oaks and elms . There are real gravestones there , unlike the newer cemeteries with their restrictions ( my mother is buried in one of those ) , And there are mausoleums and obelisks rising among the hills and along the tiny stream . It is a good cemetery , a cemetery where people have been allowed to erect the monuments they wanted to erect , and sometimes this policy has produced utter tastelessness and sometimes it has produced monuments of some beauty , but the chief result of the policy is that it somehow makes death as informal as death really is . It reminds the still living that death is not such a big deal .

His face and hands were the color and texture of leather , he stood almost six and a half feet tall , and he wore a gray Western hat . I told him what I was looking for , and he got in the car and we drove to the angel . " I 'm not sure this is Mr. Wolfe 's angel , " he said , " but this is the angel that everybody wants to see , The reason is , her eyes follow you everywhere you go . " The angel was magnificently carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes did , indeed , follow you . I started to say that I thought this was because the sculptor had slightly crossed the eyes , but then I looked closer at the tall man in the Western hat and I saw that his eyes had been sculpted in the same way . He remembered the child 's grave with the glass globe full of toys , but he said it was no longer there . " Some kids broke it all up , " he said . Then we went to the Indian princess 's grave . Over the grave there was a sort of pyramid of stone , with the top leveled off , and on the top there was a small Grecian temple with columns . Set just inside the columns , at eye level , there was a sepia engraving of the grave 's occupant , who had died in 1897 at the age of twenty-six . Below the picture was the poem : In thy dark eyes ' splendor Where the warm light loves to dwell , Weary looks , yet tender Speak their last farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of ier face had been chipped away ? " Some kids P art of the feeling of Raleigh , and of other towns and small cities across the nation , his particularly of places in the South , is the soil . In the South it ranks in importance behind only race , and , of course , the feeling of race is inextricably enmeshed in the feeling of the land . This is not to say that Raleigh is a farm town , with dusty side streets and gas pumps and general stores . It probably never was like that . There are sidewalks and streets and coin-operated car washes and drive-in banks and electronics-research firms and computers and Holiday Inns and quarter-acre " estates " in the new housing developments , as elsewhere . But the feeling is still there , not far beneath the surface , and the migration from Cary and Garner and Knightdale constantly replenishes that feeling . People have written about the soil and the spell it puts on men , especially Southern American men ; Hollywood has tried to make movies about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so easy to come by in the South , and so difficult to avoid , of being reliant on , and owing your survival to , the idiosyncracies of that dry red clay . You can be removed from the dirt by a generation , two generations , and still feel yourself bound to it , enslaved by it . The merchants in their jackets and ties , the women shoppers in Cameron Village , even North Hills ? they all feel it and show it , even if they do not know it is there . The young men with red faces , riding around in the Chevy Novas with Confederate battle-flag license plates on the front bumper , wearing their blond hair short in brush cuts , white shirts with starched collars , and no button-downs , and no tie : the ones who run barbershops and used-car lots , looking one step removed from the Klan ? they are half a step removed from the soil . and they know it . They also know that the blacks are catching up with them fast , have gone further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit-ins started in 1960 than the white folks of the soil have gone since the Depression . And so they resent and fear the blacks more than anybody else . They gather on Saturday nights at the roadhouses that feature country music and sonic modilied , toned-down rock , and they buy setups for the liquor they carry in brown-paper bags and they eat ribs and chicken and shrimp and rolls , and they feel up their fatted women in the loose-fitting slacks who , themselves . are only half a step away , and they forget for a spell about the many things they hold in common with the blacks . Family is another part of the feeling of Raleigh . The big cities do not have this feeling . Even if a daughter lives and is raising her own family in Brooklyn , and her mother and father live only twelve miles away in the Bronx , it is possible and perfectly reasonable not to visit very often . In Raleigh they " go riding " on Sunday afternoon , first checking on the new housing developments and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's or a brother 's or an aunt 's house without warning , which is all right , because the sisters , brothers , and aunts do the same thing . In Raleigh you do not have major family arguments on Sunday afternoon , nor do you lazily kick the Sunday Times down to the foot of the bed at two in the afternoon and decide to make love . They visit , and they talk a while , and then they leave . And beneath their talk , sometimes , there is an intense family hatred , distrust , jealousy , spitefulness ? a feeling that at times can be as strong as the afflictions and magnetisms of the soil and of race . It can manifest itself on those simple Sunday afternoon excursions when the disapproval that one member of the family feels for another becomes too urgent ; it can not any longer be suppressed behind gossip about those who are not present : it is now that the truth comes out , the explosions . You 're raising that child perfectly atrociously . you are getting fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . But it is at its strongest at forced family gatherings where the strain is great and the opportunity to leave is lacking , gatherings such as funerals . I remember one : the death h as expected , long and drawn out , and when it finally came , the sisters , proud of their Southern aristocratic lineage , descended and looked skeptically at everybody else ? at one member of the family who lived in a distant city arid who had rented a car at dawn and driven five hundred miles , because he had gotten a red car , and a red car was out of place in a funeral procession ; at the young woman who recently had joined the family by marriage , because she was from another part of the world and spoke another language and therefore was a " harlot " and a " strumpet " and " probably a thief " and who , when she fought back at these accusations , then became " the most uppity little brown bitch I ever saw " ; and , finally , at everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Store and loaded their car with the sibling 's belongings and left . In Raleigh , and in the smaller cities and towns of America , you are forever enslaved by your kin . Other people know or knew your mother and father . sisters and brothers , and you are forever judged against that knowledge . If you are worthless and no-count , and your kin are n't , then you are a black sheep . If you try to be successful , and your father was a mundane clerk or an alcoholic or a philanderer. you are putting on airs and it is only a matter of time before the genes for mundaneness , alcoholism , or philandering take over and reduce you to the same shambles . There is no getting away , if you stay . A few have tried to live their own lives in their hometowns , but they have not been very successful . It is much easier to start another life someplace new , and so they go from Raleigh to Charlotte , and then , some of them , to Atlanta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave Cary and Garner and Knightdale . In New York , you can go as far as you cant . Perhaps they have the right idea in Brooklyn , on the street where we live , where there are many Italian families , whose children have all grog up and moved to Jersey or Lon Gyland. and who come back on weekends to eat Mamma 's spaghetti and to show off the new Polara , and who do not stay long , and that is that . Ailgybe , though , I am exaggerating all this , and IVA it really is the rain . Easter weekend started out with nice skies and thumping twigs in the back yard , but now it is raining , and it has been raining , and it is affecting our plans and our tempers . You can feel the initial politeness wear off and the edges start to roughen , and occasionally as you enter a room you can hear snatches of their conversations . and you wonder , from the 71 ay the subject is abruptly changed , if they are talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaved : how much you 've drunk in three days out of that bottle of vodka you brought ; whether you 're bringing up your child right . And you are there with your wife , in the bedroom at night , talking about them and wishing there were some way to communicate . So little changes , so little has changed . For every Sanitary Barber Shop that now offers razor styling , there are a dozen vacant lots h here I used to play that have not changed at all , In New York City it would have changed a dozen times ? and , most of all , the people would have changed In New York the old people disappear and are never heard of again . Here , in Raleigh , they stay around , and each time you come back you see how they have aged and you wonder if you have passed the same number of years in the same amount of time . A bent . white-haired man , in a neat suit , vest , and starched white shirt and tie , hobbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking an eternity to walk from his house to the end of the block , pausing there , turning slowly , taking another eternity to return , and you realize that this was his walk for the day . " That 's Dr. Williams . He 's pretty had off , " they say . You remember Or . Williams , the preacher at one of the more powerful churches , the recipient of a fancy car once from his loving congregation ( and the object of much criticism from those who were not so loving ) , now reduced to hobbling. unable to drive the car , something in his eyes . Fear ? Pain ? Where is God now ? All these people , with their pain and tragedy and so little humor left , so little time to laugh , watching the Newlywed Game and getting the facts all mixed up , placing bets on who will win and then not paying very good attention and being incorrect about who did win , and getting little kicks from the way the wives bitch theatrically at their shrimpy husbands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roller derby or the geek in the carnival ) , voting for Nixon and thinking they were pretty liberal because they knew a lot of people who were voting for Wallace ; their hands gnarled and beaten and twisted and sometimes their fingers severed in the course of serving , over a period of several decades , some governor or textile-millowner or fertilizer supplier whom they still refer to with utmost reverence as Mister Bob or Mister Jim or something , and who probably does n't have the slightest idea who they are , or were ? sitting there being fair game for all the television commercials that promise to end the pains of arthritis and cold miseries and psoriasis and piles ? promising to end their pain . They used to be able to dismiss most everything that bothered them with the quotation from Matthew , the one about setting the sheep on the right hand and the goats on the left . It explained everything ; the white folks got the life eternal and the nigras got the everlasting punishment . There it is , right there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideburns from Columbia or Yale has been down there talking about missions to the inner city , and they do n't go to church as religiously as they used to . They sit and watch television commercials . Where is their Cod now ? Perhaps He is within the picture tube . T he family picnic was held . despite the rain . Within an hour or so . the sky cleared and the men wandered out into the backyard , the women stayed inside and talked , and the children explored the woods . Some of them caught poison oak . I managed to eat three different kinds of deviled eggs and two different kinds of potato salad . For the first time in my memory , since leaving home , nobody talked about niggers or hippies . The grass was good , and so was the pine straw , and the ground was springy beneath our feet . We inspected the greenhouse my cousin David was building . It was good , when you came in from outside , scraping your shoes on the driveway , then again on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other mat inside the dour , all in an attempt to get the red clay off your shoes . In New York you never do this unless it has been raining or snowing hard or you inadvertently stepped in a mess left by a dog . On the way back from the picnic Polly burst into tears and said she wanted to live in Raleigh . She said there were five good reasons why we should move there : not so much pollution , not so much hatred , more room , shopping centers , and one other reason I can not recall . Then she asked me to give her five good reasons why we could n't move . I was unable to answer . either to her satisfaction or mine . W alt Disney 's Wonderful World of Color is V on , its volume somewhat louder than necessary , and we sit across the room , talking over it all . It is about a little Indian boy who is expelled from his tribe and who becomes friendly with an eagle . The eagle , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay . There is some spectacular photography . The conversation continues . There is talk of a young man with glaucoma , of the most recent family tragedy ( a relative was burned badly in a fire in her home ; her daughter and grandchildren died by fire a few years ago ; her husband 's first wife burned to death ) . " Remember when Pat came through here with that string of stuff , son ? " I remembered ; my cousin , who was an officer in the Army , had commanded a convoy that had passed through Raleigh right after Pearl Harbor . We had walked up to U.S. 70. a Meek away , and watched them come through . Pat had stopped and we had all talked for a few minutes , and then he drove away , and it was very much like one of those movies about the glory of war . My father remembered that it was an all-Negro regiment that Pat was conveying . I did not remember that ; I remembered only that they were soldiers . " Do you remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back yard right after Pearl Harbor and you put it up on blocks and stored the tires in the basement ? " He did not remember that . We remember what we want to remember , I suppose , and we forget what we want to forget , and between the two of us , I doubt that we could put together much of a history hook . I already have asked about one thing that is very important to me , the circumstances of my adoption , and he does n't remember that . We have lived , together . more than one hundred and twelve years , and perhaps it is time to be less serious about searching for things that can not be found . O n the way back to Brooklyn , we took the coastal route . I told them it was because I was bored with interstate highways and turnpikes and I wanted to see the ocean again . But the coastal route took us down U.S. 64 , through Nashville , the seat of Nash County , and that may have been the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we drove past the courthouse , of stopping and going in and opening that book to February 23 , 1935 . But I decided not to . I was in a hurry , I suppose , to get home .
