txt King Hassan of Morocco has raised the wind over his claim to Spanish Sahara ? and the danger is that it might turn into a whirlwind beyond his control . - Because the World Court at The Hague ruled last week ( in effect ) that Morocco 's . claim to sovereignty over the Spanish Sahara had not been established , King Hassan has decided to assert that claim by heading a march of 350,000 unarmed Moroccans into the territory . Spain 's riposte has been to call for an urgent  --  meeting of the United Nations Security Council . The King 's pressing of his claim to the Spanish Sahara is all the greater because : 1 . It gives him an issue which tends to unite Moroccans behind him and makes less likely a repetition of the coup attempts to overthrow him of July , 1971 , and August , 1972 . A leader of the country 's biggest opposition party said earlier this month that if the King failed to act on the Spanish Sahara , " the consequences could be very serious for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recent years to have the biggest known reserves of phosphates in the world .

If the deposits in the Spanish Sahara come into full exploitation by hands other than those of Moroccans , Morocco 's preeminent position as a phosphate exporter will be challenged . The irony in all this is that although Morocco is laying claim to a territory over which the Spanish flag still flies , Moroccans do not see Spain as the principal foe in this dispute . That role is reserved for the big fellow-Arab land to the east , Algeria . Algeria has been from the start a contestant for a share of the real estate if Spain withdrew from the Spanish Sahara . Another contestant has been Mauretania , to the south of the territory in dispute .

This left Algeria out in the cold , depriving it of the strip of territory across the Spanish Sahara which it had coveted as a short cut from the Tindouf area to the Atlantic . Algeria 's countermove has been to support more actively the cause of self-determination for the 60,000-70,000 people of the Spanish Sahara ( which is almost all inhospitable desert ) . Spain reiterated before the UN Oct. 1 that it intended to go ahead with a referendum on self-determination within the territory during the first half of next year . Morocco is against any such referendum . Algeria is particularly anxious for an outlet from the Tindouf area to the Atlantic because of iron and other mineral deposits there . Instability or fighting on the northwest Shoulder of Africa could have strategic consequences since the area is so close to the approaches to the Mediterranean through the Strait of Gibraltar .

Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call off his highly provocative " peace march " into Spanish Sahara if Spain will agree to abandon its decolonization commitments to the United Nations and permit Morocco and Mauretania to annex the territory . This emerges from remarks made here by the Moroccan Ambassador , Abdelatif Filali , to a group of Spanish journalists . " The pacific march has not started yet , " the Ambassador is quoted as saying . " There are high hopes of reaching an understanding with Spain that would provide a peaceful and satisfactory solution . " Spain is ready to let the territory 's 60,000 inhabitants opt for independence under United Nations supervision . But in May the Spanish Government warned the UN that Spain would pull out of the territory quickly and on short notice if the then deteriorating situation threatened to go out of control . The mood of the Spanish public is that " Western Sahara is not worth a war . " But King Hassan 's " peace march " of 350,000 Moroccan men , women , and children risks provoking a conflict , not so much with Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
