SCENE : Slightly raked stage . A plain white muslin flat represents the upstage wall . It does not run the full width of the stage but leaves empty space on either side of it . It should be made obvious that it 's a flat to the audience . There are no side walls . Dead center upstage , almost flush with the flat , is a black upright piano . Not a grand piano . Downstage left is a blue stuffed armchair with a brass floor lamp set to the upstage side of it . The lamp has a pale yellow shade with small green palm trees painted all around it in a circle . These are the only objects onstage . The floor of the stage is not painted but left bare . The entire set is visible to the audience as they come in . In the center of the floor , the outline of a man 's body sprawled out in an awkward position of death is painted in white . The lights begin to dim very slowly . At their halfway point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding his face from the audience with his coat , as though afraid to be photographed . He is wearing a shabby black suit . He sits quickly on the piano stool , back to audience , and faces the piano . As the lights continue to dim , he raises both arms very slowly with the fingers of both hands interlaced until they are straight above his head . When he gets to the top of his stretch he cracks his knuckles loudly . The lights go to black . A loud gunshot is heard offstage , in the dark . Sound of a body falling hard to the floor . Lamp is switched on . Lights bank back up fast . PIANO PLAYER is still sitting at the bench with both arms still raised high , fingers together . Lights begin to slowly dim again . As they do , PIANO PLAYER lowers his arms slowly and sets them on the keys of the piano . He begins to play . PABLO and LOUIS , the two detectives , enter from right accompanied by the music . LOUIS is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels by PABLO . PABLO is dressed in a long overcoat , baggy pants , shiny black shoes and a detective 's hat . LOUIS wears striped pants , brown and white brogans , striped shirt and tie , black vest , black garters on his arms and a black detective 's hat which he holds on his stomach while he 's being dragged . The piano music continues as PABLO pulls him into center stage with some effort then drops both heels to the floor . Piano stops . LOUIS stays on the floor on his back . PABLO looks down at him . PIANO PLAYER just sits with back to audience . Lights stop at 1/2 level . PABLO ( catching his breath ) Trying to reconstruct the imagination of it . p. 3 LOUIS ( still on his back ) What ? PABLO The imagination . ( between breaths ) The imagination of it . How we suppose it might have been . It 's useless . All we come up with is " supposes . " LOUIS Where 's your briefcase ? PABLO ( suddenly hysterical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going in circles ) Oh my God ! What 's happening to me ! LOUIS You left it by the fire hydrant . PABLO Oh my God ! ( PABLO rushes back off stage right . LOUIS slowly gets to his feet . He pauses a moment , standing there , looks down at the outline of the body on the floor . He pretends to be shot by a silent bullet and tries to fall into the shape of the outline . On the floor he checks out his position in relationship to the outline and adjusts his body accordingly . PABLO enters again from right with a big black briefcase . He crosses straight to the armchair down left , sits quickly , opens the briefcase on his lap and worriedly checks through reams of typewritten papers . LOUIS stays on the floor . ) LOUIS These positions remind me of hieroglyphs . p. 4 PABLO It 's lucky the whole thing was n't ripped off . There it was , sitting there plain as day . Just sitting on the cement . LOUIS The similarity between positions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ignored . PABLO Will you get up off the floor and help me with this ! LOUIS ( sitting up ) What 's to help ? It 's all there is n't it ? PABLO How should I know ! That 's why I 'm checking ! LOUIS Well , what if it was n't all there ? So what ? PABLO Why are you so casual ? Why are you always so goddamn casual ! LOUIS ( lies back down in position of outline ) The guy 's dead , right ? PABLO ( still going through papers ) That 's right . That 's right . The guy 's dead . Very brilliant . LOUIS This is all after the fact . PABLO Not if there 's extenuating circumstances ! LOUIS Do n't use big words . It 's embarrassing . PABLO I 'm not afraid of my education ! It serves me . It gives me a certain support . Even in the company of goons , it 's a comfort . It gives me hope of a certain kind . p. 5 LOUIS ( still on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not getting into this with you , Louis . Every time you sucker me into this I regret it . I 'm not even going to start . ( LOUIS gets up off the floor quickly and crosses to the lamp beside PABLO . He stares at the lampshade and turns it in a circle with his hand . PABLO keeps poring through the papers . ) LOUIS Beautiful shade . Antique probably . PABLO ( not looking up ) I doubt it on his salary . LOUIS ( still turning shade ) Do composers get a salary ? PABLO Commissions . Whatever . He did n't make much . LOUIS How come ? PABLO Nobody bought it , that 's how come ! Nobody bought the music . ( LOUIS starts pulling the chain switch on the lamp , turning it off and on as he stares at the shade . PABLO keeps on with the papers . ) LOUIS Nobody bought the music ? PABLO That 's right . LOUIS So he blew his brains out . p. 6 PABLO That 's little oversimplified . LOUIS So he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LOUIS Down in the dumps . PABLO We do n't know . LOUIS That 's no reason to blow your brains out . I mean , love is a better reason is n't it ? PABLO I do n't know ! And stop switching that lamp on and off ! ( LOUIS stops . Pause . ) PABLO Why do n't you go into the kitchen and make us a b.l.t. while I go through these papers . LOUIS ( moving back toward center ) It 's not our kitchen . PABLO So what ? LOUIS It 's his kitchen . PABLO What 're you superstitious or something ? LOUIS I have my doubts . PABLO About what ? LOUIS About being here so soon . I mean it was n't that long ago he was dragged out of here . PABLO ( throwing papers up in the air ) I ca n't find it anywhere in here ! Our one piece of evidence and it 's gone ! p. 7 LOUIS Do n't get yer pants in a bunch . It 'll turn up . PABLO Listen , Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now , I 'm calling the Squad and asking them to send me a new man ! I mean it , Louis ! I 've had it ! LOUIS You certainly have . PABLO I 've had it up to here with your goddamn casual attitude ! It 's as though nothing matters . As though nothing 's happened . We could be sitting in the governor 's mansion for all you give a shit . LOUIS I have a theory . PABLO There could be big stakes involved in this for us if you had eyeballs to see into the possibilities . If you thought for one second about the implications ! LOUIS I have a theory . PABLO The ramifications . It 's chocked full of juicy potential criminal action against some very big steam in some very high places and you ca n't even see beyond your own nose . LOUIS I have a theory . Do you wan na hear it ? PABLO ( pausing , catches his breath ) What theory ? ( PIANO PLAYER begins to play , accompanying LOUIS as he speaks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOUIS. ) p. 8 LOUIS ( piano behind ) A boy hears sound . He hears sound before he has a name . He hears gurgling , pounding underwater . He hears an ocean of blood swimming around him . Through his veins . Through his mother . He breaks into the light of day . He 's shocked that he has a voice . He finds his voice and screams . He hears it screaming as though coming down through ancient time . Like it belongs to another body . He hears it that way . He hears the crack of his own flesh . His own heart . His skin sliding on rubber mats . Squeaking . He hears his own bones growing . Stretching his skin in all directions . Bones moving out . Organs expanding . The sound of cells booming through his brain like tiny intergalactic missiles . Atoms . Nuclear rushes of wind through his nose holes . Toenails rubbing blankets in the dark . Books falling on pianos . Electricity humming even when the lights are off . Internal combustion engines . Turbo jets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hears what they call " music " in the same way he hears what they call " noise . " In the same stream . Music as an extension of sound . An organization . Another way of putting it . He 's disappointed . He 's disappointed and exhilarated at the same time . Exhilarated because he sees an opening . An adventure . A way inside . He sees that putting any two things together produces sound . Any two things . Striking , plucking , blowing , rubbing , dropping , kicking , kissing . Any two things . He has a revelation . Or rather , a revelation presents itself . Stabs at him . Enters into him and becomes part of his physiology . His physiognomy . His psychology . His paraphernalia . His makeup . He puts it to use . He 's driven toward it in a way most men consider dangerous and suicidal . His production is abundant . Nonstop . Endlessly winding through un-heard-of-before symphonies . Concertos beyond belief . He organizes quintets . Soloists rush to him just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He only takes on apprentices . He only plays nightclubs although he could pack out the Garden in a flash . He shakes the sidewalks with his compositions . Every city in the world is calling his name . He invents totally new chord progressions and scales . New names for notes that not even the Chinese have heard of . Instruments that he makes in the bathtub . His music is sweeping the country . And then one day he disappears . Just like that . He goes . Not dead . Just gone . No one can figure it . Rumors are spread that he 's kidnapped . Abducted and taken to Sweden . Then it switches to murder . Talk of him being involved with particular ladies of particular gentlemen . Then his body is found . His body is found but his face is blown off . His fingerprints are tested and they check out completely . His one-of-a-kind fingerprints . The case is closed . p. 9 PABLO ( short pause , still looking through papers ) Is that it ? LOUIS No . PABLO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? LOUIS He 's fooled them all . PABLO How do you mean ? LOUIS He 's just laying low . PABLO ( crossing , begins to pace , LOUIS crosses to chair ) That does n't make any sense at all ! He 's got nothing to lay low for . LOUIS Aha ! We do n't know that for sure . That 's where the case gets interesting . ( LOUIS sits in chair and starts going through papers as PABLO paces back and forth . ) PABLO He was at the top of the bill . Maybe not as high up as you depict but pretty goddamn high up there . Why disappear when things are going so good . It 's crazy . LOUIS But Possible . PABLO It 's a crazy theory ! ( sees LOUIS with papers ) Stay away from those papers ! ( PABLO rushes over to LOUIS and grabs the papers out of his hands. ) p. 10 PABLO Just keep your hands off ! LOUIS Look , I 'm on this case too . This stuff 's not confidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who the hell called me up in the middle of the goddamn night , worried sick , and wanted to know if these papers were under lock and key ? Who do you suppose ? LOUIS I have n't the faintest . PABLO The governor ! That 's who , wise ass ! The governor ! Not confidential my ass . They 're Super-Confidential ! They 're so confidential , they 're even classified . That 's how confidential they are . Classified by a top-flight agency . I 'm not at liberty to say any more about it . LOUIS You 've become a blithering idiot , Pablo . A total meatball . Those papers are as valuable as yesterday 's Daily News . There 's nothing in there but palilalia . Do you know what " palilalia " is ? PABLO I 'm not talking . LOUIS Well " palilalia " is what you 've got . " Palilalia " is what you 've got right there in your hamburger hands . And that 's all you 've got . PABLO I know you 've been trying to sabotage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very beginning . There 's something in you that wants to destroy me. p. 11 LOUIS You 're a turkey , Pablo . A total turkey . PABLO I do n't see any possible way that we can work together . I just do n't see how it 's possible . It would be hard enough working with someone who 's compassionate and sensitive and at least showed an interest in the case but you 're totally negative . LOUIS Indifferent . PABLO That 's worse than negative ! LOUIS I 'm trying to remain objective about this . PABLO Objective my ass ! You 're dead weight , Louis ! Dead weight ! ( LOUIS stands suddenly , listening intently for a noise . No sound . ) LOUIS What was that ? PABLO What was what ? LOUIS That . ( They both listen for a second . Again nothing . ) PABLO Not only are you dead weight but you 're a lunatic . LOUIS No , listen ! PABLO I 'm not going to listen ! I 'm through listening . LOUIS Like a woman screaming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PABLO It 's your ears , Louis ! Your ears are telling you stories . p. 12 LOUIS ( crossing toward outline on floor ) I do n't like the idea of having this outline of a dead man on the floor with us . It 's primitive . There 's something creepy about it . PABLO Do n't touch it until the Squad gets here ! LOUIS I 'm not going to touch it . PABLO What is it with you anyway ? Have you completely lost touch with your vocation ? LOUIS I 'm wasting away . At least half of me is wasting away . PABLO Pull yourself together . LOUIS You did n't hear a voice ? PABLO Of course not . LOUIS Do n't be so smug about it . You 're totally ignorant of what 's going on here . You 're blundering around in here as though this was just another ordinary old homicide . You 're blinded by your career . PABLO I 'm not distorting the facts yet , if that 's what you mean . LOUIS You do n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( pause as they stare at each other ) Now let 's get to work . LOUIS What now ? p. 13 PABLO A stabbing . We have n't tried a stabbing yet . LOUIS His face was blown off . PABLO There 's no report from ballistics ! LOUIS You do n't need a report when someone 's face is blown away . PABLO It could 've been carved off . Now you stand over there where the body was found and I 'll come at you with a butcher knife . LOUIS Have you got a butcher knife ? PABLO I 'll get a butcher knife . Now you just stand there and wait . ( PABLO exits up left . LOUIS stands center stage . Simultaneously with PABLO 'S exit , PETRONE enters from stage right . He 's tall and extremely skinny , wearing baggy pants , T-shirt and suspenders . He has an alto saxophone strapped to his neck . He bites down on the mouthpiece and mimes blowing it . No sound comes from the sax but a high shrill scream of a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical note but definitely be a scream . It stays on one note for ten full seconds as PETRONE keeps blowing silently into the horn . LOUIS does not hear the scream . He just stands there . Suddenly PABLO rushes on very fast from stage left holding a butcher knife high above his head as though he 's going to stab LOUIS . He stops just short of LOUIS with his arms still raised holding the knife . Scream stops . PETRONE takes his mouth off the sax. ) p. 14 PABLO I ca n't do it . LOUIS You 're not supposed to do it . If you did it , I 'd be dead . ( PABLO drops the knife to the floor and goes to the chair and collapses into it . LOUIS bends over and picks up the knife . PETRONE crosses into the center area . ) PETRONE ( to LOUIS ) You seen Niles ? LOUIS Niles ? No . Why ? PETRONE We were supposed to get together . PABLO ( still in chair ) I ca n't get it up . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening to me ? I 've waited a lifetime for a case like this . And now I ca n't get it up . PETRONE ( crossing toward chair , to PABLO ) Do you mind if I sit in that chair ? That 's the chair I always sit in . PABLO Yes I do mind . I 'm having a nervous breakdown as a matter of fact . PETRONE Well do you mind if I sit on your lap then ? I 've got ta sit down . My bones are snapping . PABLO ( to LOUIS ) Who is this guy ? ( to PETRONE ) Sure ! Sure , sit on my lap ! What the hell ! The whole case is going to pot anyway . ( PETRONE sits down on PABLO 'S lap . He smiles at LOUIS , who is still handling the knife. ) p. 15 PETRONE ( to LOUIS ) You guys are awful nice . You know that ? Awful nice . I 'm part of the scum of the earth . You know what I mean . Low DOGS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you agree ? Would n't you guys agree to that ? LOUIS Sure . PETRONE Same as they got in India . Would n't you say ? Same story over here . No different . LOUIS No different . That 's for sure . PETRONE There 's more disguises over here I guess . More ways of covering it up . But I have a theory that it 's something we 're born with . You know what I mean ? I mean it seems like I 'll never get out of it . LOUIS You 're right . You wo n't . PETRONE You wo n't either . LOUIS I might . But you definitely wo n't . PETRONE You 're right . PABLO Would you mind shifting a little bit ? PETRONE ( shifting his weight on PABLO 'S lap ) Oh sure . Sorry about the bones . This time of year they get particularly menacing . One time it got so bad they came right out at the elbows . Right straight out like two white fish . p. 16 LOUIS You mean out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I almost blinded people in the daytime . The sun bounced right off them like ivory . Right into people 's faces . People bounced back , holding their eyes , screaming in pain . It was a great feeling of power it gave me . A great feeling . Like I possessed certain laser rays within my elbows and if anyone fucked with me I just pointed them in the right direction . PABLO Get off my lap please . PETRONE No . LOUIS ( after pause ) You were supposed to meet Niles here ? PETRONE I am meeting him . That 's what I 'm here for . We 're going to play . LOUIS He 's dead . PETRONE No he 's not . LOUIS Yes he is . PETRONE No he 's not . LOUIS Yes he is . PETRONE No he 's not . LOUIS ( after pause ) Get off my partner 's lap please . PETRONE ( laughing ) Your partner ? This is your partner ? Like Gabby Hayes ? You remember Gabby Hayes ? p. 17 LOUIS Yes I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 're you guys doin ' here anyway ? This is n't your house . PABLO We probably have more of a right to be here than you do . In fact we 're fully within our rights . LOUIS We 're investigating a murder . PABLO A possible murder . PETRONE You 're detectives ? LOUIS That 's right . PETRONE Like Dick Tracy ! You remember Dick Tracy ? LOUIS ( after pause , fondling knife ) If you do n't get off my partner 's lap ( pause ) I do n't know what I 'm going to do . PETRONE I remember Dick Tracy . ( he gets off PABLO 'S lap and crosses upstage ) I remember all about him . Two-way wrist radio . His yellow hat . His black Mercury . LOUIS Are you part of Niles ' band ? ( PETRONE turns to LOUIS and stares at him . He puts the saxophone to his mouth and starts to finger the keys . No sound from the sax except the rhythmic tapping of the keys . He keeps this up . LOUIS crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PABLO ) Are you all right ? PABLO Do n't be ridiculous . LOUIS ( under his breath ) We 've got to get out of here . This is worse than I expected . PABLO Do n't panic . It could be our big break . I 'll try to have a talk with him . ( PABLO gets up and crosses to PETRONE , who continues fingering the sax . ) LOUIS It 's too dangerous , Pablo ! You do n't know what you 're getting into . PABLO ( to PETRONE ) You 've known Niles for some time I take it ? ( PETRONE keeps blowing silently into sax and fingering keys . ) LOUIS He 's burned out , Pablo . You wo n't get anywhere with him . I say we go back to headquarters and file a report . PABLO Do you know if he had any girl friends ? ( PETRONE stops " playing " sax for a second and looks hard at PABLO . ) PABLO Any lady friends that we might be able to have a talk with ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays " silently again. ) p. 19 LOUIS Leave him alone and let 's get out of here ! PABLO ( to PETRONE ) Any rackets ? ( LOUIS suddenly puts the butcher knife up to his own neck as though about to kill himself . PABLO and PETRONE pay no attention . ) PABLO ( to PETRONE ) Was he involved in any side activities ? Poppy seeds ? Pari-mutuels ? O.T.B. ? Anything like that ? ( LOUIS starts to struggle with one hand against the hand that 's holding the knife against his neck . PABLO and PETRONE continue without noticing . ) PABLO It could be important . You see , I have a strong inclination that he did n't kill himself . I have the feeling he was under the influence of macabre overtones . A victim of odious events that spiraled toward his eventual downfall . ( PIANO PLAYER breaks in here , strong forceful bass line . PETRONE keeps playing silently . LOUIS struggles more desperately with the knife hand , moving all over the stage ; PABLO keeps talking . ) PABLO A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his head . He bought off more than he could chew . He began dallying with power figures . He was sinking in a sea of confusion . His music was driving him mad . His improvisations were lasting for days on end . He had to be dragged from his piano and strapped to his bed . Fed intravenously to keep him from starving . He forgot how to speak and only uttered noises of varying pitch . His gestures were all in slow motion as the shock of fast movement was too loud for his ears . He began to feel certain that he was possessed . Not as if by magic but by his own gift . His own voracious hunger for sound became like a demon . Another body within him that lashed out without warning . That took hold of him and swept him away . Each time with more and more violence until his weaker side began to collapse . He was desperate for some kind of help so he turned to religion . Superstition . Cultism . There were plenty of self-proclaimed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyenas in the wings . He gave himself over to them willingly . Anything that promised to deliver him from this nightmare . He followed their every demand . His music was written to their specifications . His money was put in their hands . His thoughts were geared to their dogma . And his demon began to be tamed . It changed its attitude completely and started to toe the line . His music turned into boring melodics . Slowly he noticed the change . He liked the new feeling of freedom . He thanked his masters and told them that now that the demon had left him he would go off on his own again . But they told him he could n't . That he was still in danger . That as long as he was within their power he 'd be all right . He 'd be safe . He argued with them for weeks on end . His mind would go back and forth between submission and rebellion . His music was turning to pablum . Finally he decided to leave them completely . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETRONE stops . LOUIS falls to the floor , exhausted from the struggle . The knife falls from his hand. ) p. 20 LOUIS ( breathing heavily , on floor ) Pablo , we 've got to get out of here ! PABLO ( to LOUIS , crossing back to chair and papers ) Get up off the floor . We 're through with simulating events now . Now we 've got some real evidence . PETRONE ( to PABLO ) That 's not the way it happened at all . You guys are really off the deep end . PABLO Ah ! Then you admit something did happen ! That 's more than you were admitting before . LOUIS There 's no evidence , Pablo ! PETRONE You guys better get outa ' here before Niles comes back . PABLO Where 's he gone to ? PETRONE He went out to get some toasted English muffins . That 's the only thing he eats when he 's working . PABLO Where did he go to get the toasted English muffins ? PETRONE Hey , lighten up , buster . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing slowly toward PETRONE ) What do you know about improvisation ? PETRONE You talkin ' to me ? p. 21 LOUIS ( still on floor ) Pablo , will you leave him alone ! PABLO ( to PETRONE ) Yes . You claim to be one of Niles ' musicians . I have n't heard a sound come out of your horn yet . PETRONE You have n't ? PABLO No , I have n't . PETRONE Well , it takes a while to attune your ears to the frequency we 're playing in . It 's extremely high . Dogs ca n't even hear it . That 's why Niles has trouble selling it . PABLO I see . PETRONE It 's also an attempt at visual music . You 'll have to wait for Niles to come so he can explain it to you . I know how to play it but I ca n't explain it . PABLO I ca n't wait for Niles . ( LOUIS starts struggling with his hand again as it tries to reach for the knife . He grabs it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out again for the knife , etc . ) PETRONE You guys are very pushy , you know that ? I 'm not even used to talking and you 're trying to force me into explanations . PABLO What do you know about improvisation ? PETRONE Will you get off that kick ! That 's not something to mess around with . That 's private ! p. 22 PABLO How does it relate to breaking with tradition ! To breaking off with the past ! To throwing the diligent efforts of our forefathers and their forefathers before them to the winds ! To turning the classics to garbage before our very eyes ! To distorting the very foundations of our cherished values ! ( piano breaks in with loud atonal chords at random intervals ) To making mincemeat out of brilliance ! To rubbing up against the very grain of sanity and driving us all to complete and utter destruction ! To changing the shape of American morality ! That 's where it 's at ! That 's where it 's at is n't it ! You 've snuck up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to take us over by direct political action so you 've chosen to drive us all crazy . Then , when we 're all completely within your control , you 'll take us over . That 's it is n't it ? You 're getting back at us after all these years . I was n't born yesterday you know ! I know a thing or two ! I know when I 'm being bushwhacked ! ( Piano stops . ) LOUIS ( from floor , reaching for knife ) Pablo ! Could you reach me the knife ? ( LAUREEN enters from stage right dressed in a bathrobe and wheeling an acoustic double bass fiddle in front of her . The bass is contained in a canvas case . As soon as she enters she screams on a high note and continues the scream until she 's crossed to center stage . She stops center stage and ends the scream . She unzips the canvas case , takes out a bow and starts bowing the bass on random notes . It makes no difference if she knows how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new development . PETRONE crosses down to the chair and sits in it . He starts going through PABLO 'S papers . LOUIS keeps reaching for the knife on the floor . There is a while that passes with no talk. ) p. 23 PETRONE ( to PABLO , in chair as he browses through papers ) There was a time when I felt like that myself . As though a particular group was at the heart of it . As though secret organizations were constantly plotting against me . Not just against me but against all members of my particular caste . The Low Dogs . Gang warfare on an international scale . It got so that I felt they were personally responsible for a bad count of smack . LAUREEN ( as she bows the bass , to PABLO ) Your partner is reaching for the knife . PABLO ( as he circles around her ) Yes , I know . LAUREEN ( to PABLO ) You should tell him that everything 's all right . There 's no need for that kind of stuff now . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she plays ) How long have you known Niles ? LAUREEN We 've gone through that particular era . Something new is called for now . There 's no need for remorse . He 's defeating the purpose . PABLO Just answer the question ! LAUREEN ( still playing ) You should tell him not to jump to conclusions . There 's no organization strong enough to make you crumble . There 's no system stronger than a single man . He should just stand up and forget about the whole thing . What 's he killing himself for anyway ? An audience ? There is n't any audience . Tell him there is n't any audience . Tell him that . p. 24 PABLO HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN NILES ! ANSWER THE QUESTION ! ( She stops playing and looks at PABLO . ) LAUREEN ( to PABLO ) Long enough . ( she looks at LOUIS ) Will you get up off the floor please ? It 's distracting . ( LOUIS stops reaching for the knife . He looks at her . ) LOUIS ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in half ? LAUREEN No way of telling . LOUIS Are n't we leaderless ? Jobless ? Destitute ? Forlorn ? LAUREEN Just get up . LOUIS Not until I get some guarantees ! PETRONE ( from chair , with papers ) Let him kill himself . Who gives a fuck . ( PABLO rushes over to PETRONE and grabs the papers out of his hands . ) PABLO ( to PETRONE ) Stay away from those papers ! LAUREEN ( to LOUIS ) Personally , it does n't matter to me one way or the other if you kill yourself . It just seems pointless . ( LAUREEN goes back to bowing the bass , LOUIS stays on floor , PABLO goes through his papers , PETRONE sits in chair. ) p. 25 LOUIS ( to LAUREEN ) To you it would seem pointless ! You 've got a particular calling . You 've got an obsession . The whole structure can collapse around you and you would n't mind . You 'd just sit there fiddling away like Nero or something . ( suddenly hysterical , throwing himself around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'M DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND ! I 'M WAY DOWN HERE ! YOU CA N'T EVEN SEE ME I 'M SO LOW ! PETRONE ( to PABLO ) I 'm lower than him . LAUREEN ( casually to LOUIS as she plays ) Pick yourself up . LOUIS Stop saying that to me ! I 'm a detective ! I should be ordering you around ! I should be the strong one ! LAUREEN But you 're not . LOUIS Pablo , call her off ! She 's trying to destroy my opinions ! PABLO ( calmly to LAUREEN and PETRONE ) It 's time for you people to leave now . You 've been very helpful . We 'll call you if we need any further information . PETRONE ( to himself ) We need another martyr like a hole in the head . LOUIS I 'M NO MARTYR ! I 'M A DETECTIVE ! p. 26 PABLO Louis , get up . LAUREEN ( still playing ) This music has no room for politics . It answers to nobody . It plays by itself even when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to listen . It has no boss . Even when the boss is dead it keeps playing . PABLO ( suddenly lunging toward LAUREEN ) Was Niles the boss ? Was that it ? LAUREEN ( still playing ) Even when idiots surround it on all sides . ( PETRONE stands suddenly . LAUREEN stops playing . ) PETRONE ( to PABLO ) I 'll tell you the whole story . You wan na ' hear it ? I 'll tell you the whole thing . It 's no secret . PABLO ( rushing to LOUIS ) Louis , get up ! He 's going to spill the beans . Get up ! Get up ! LOUIS Right now ? PABLO Get up ! Come on . We 've finally forced their hand . ( PABLO helps LOUIS to his feet and takes him over to the armchair . He sets LOUIS down in the armchair and then sits on his lap . PETRONE moves center stage . PIANO PLAYER begins to play behind PETRONE . LAUREEN accompanies on the bass. ) p. 27 PETRONE The story of Niles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story ? PABLO ( sitting on LOUIS lap ) He 's going to tell us the whole story . LOUIS I could 've easily killed myself , you know . PABLO It 's all right now . It 's going to be all right . We 've got them just where we want them . They 're playing right into our hands . PETRONE ( to LOUIS and PABLO ) Niles was a big man . A huge man in fact . The kind of man you 'd take to be a brakeman before anything else . ( NILES enters from up right with a flashlight . He 's accompanied by PAULLETTE , a skinny young girl in a skimpy dress with a blanket over her shoulders . She carries a large suitcase . NILES is very big , dressed in a crumpled black suit , dark glasses and a black hat . They both sneak on tiptoes very slowly toward center stage . The others do not relate to them . Piano accompanies them . PETRONE narrates but does not direct anything to NILES and PAULLETTE . ) NILES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , Paullette ? They could be waiting around in there . p. 28 PAULETTE No , it 's perfect . If you waited any longer you 'd give them time to figure it out . NILES Do n't the streets smell funny ? PAULETTE They smell wet . PETRONE ( to LOUIS and PABLO ) His hands were so huge they could stretch two octaves in a single stroke . Not even Art Tatum could boast such hands . Not even Joe " Fingers " Carr . The kind of hands that looked capable of breaking a young calf in half . ( NILES and PAULLETTE approach the center playing area and stop at the edge of it . ) NILES ( whispering ) You better take a look inside , just to make sure . ( PAULLETTE goes up on her tiptoes as though looking through a window . ) NILES See anything ? PAULETTE Nothing . Just an outline of your body on the floor . NILES Nothing else ? PAULETTE Nope . ( NILES and PAULLETTE sneak their way into the center stage area , amongst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Piano keeps playing . LAUREEN accompanies on bass . LOUIS and PABLO are spellbound watching PETRONE tell the story. ) p. 29 PETRONE As a child he was held in contempt by the other children because of his giant proportions . The kids called him " Brontosaurus Morris " and other nasty things . He was totally awkward as an adolescent and could n't even speak a full sentence until the age of eighteen . ( Suddenly the music stops , the stage lights go black . Only NILES ' flashlight is seen . Then a pale follow spot comes on , illuminating NILES and PAULLETTE . The others stay motionless . ) NILES What happened ? PAULETTE ( in a heavy whisper ) We 're inside . It 's all right . We 're inside now . NILES No one 's here ? PAULETTE Just us . NILES Did you hear someone screaming ? PAULETTE No , Niles . It 's okay now . NILES I just want to do it and get out of here . PAULETTE We do n't have to rush . We got plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back . I already escaped . How come I came back ? PAULETTE ( setting suitcase down center on the ground and opening it ) We just got ta ' do this one thing and then we 'll be gone . ( PAULLETTE starts taking different pieces of clothing and masks out of the suitcase as NILES moves around the stage with the flashlight , shining it in different areas . Once in a while the flashlight crosses somebody 's face but he does n't linger on it . The stage lights stay dark . Just the flashlight and the follow spots. ) p. 30 NILES It 's not so easy to leave a life . It 's not the easiest thing in the world . I can still smell myself in this place . It feels like I never left . PAULETTE It 'll be different . NILES When ? PAULETTE Just take it easy . NILES ( shining flashlight on outline on floor ) Why do they still have this outline of my body on the floor ? Maybe they 're not convinced . PAULETTE Stop worrying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through all my papers ! Look at my papers all over the place ! PAULETTE Go make yourself some coffee or something . NILES I just had a nightmare . I just had a nightmare while I was standing here . PAULETTE What ? NILES What if it turns out to be harder playing dead than it was playing alive ? PAULETTE That 's not the way it works . You 've got to give yourself time to settle into this thing , Niles . I 'll explain the whole thing to you . NILES How come I 'm trusting you ? How come ? All of a sudden I 'm wondering that . I never questioned that before . p. 31 PAULETTE You know why . NILES I know you 're not one of those big city models . I know that much . I know you 're not hooked up to the politicians . The gangsters . The rackets . Dope syndicates . Numbers . Private Foundations . Federal Granting Organizations . C.I.A . Code Scanning . I know that much . I checked all that out . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I have n't checked out is the more insidious groups . The Mind Benders . The Chromatic Persuaders . The Psychic Transfusions . The Cult Mongers . All forms of ritualistic terrorism . That area is completely in the dark ! PAULETTE Do n't shout . NILES ( suddenly screaming ) THERE 'S VOICES COMING AT ME ! ( PAULLETTE jumps up and goes to him . ) PAULETTE Niles , quiet down ! If they catch you here now , it 's all over . NILES ( screaming ) THERE 'S VOICES FROM ALL SIDES ! PAULETTE There 's nothing here now . You 've shot yourself in the head and it 's all over . NILES IT 'S NOT ! IT 'S NOT OVER ! ( LAUREEN lets out her shrill high scream again . Stage lights stay dark through this . Just follow spot . Piano comes in strong . Sax is heard live here , high wailing sounds . LAUREEN bows the bass in sharp rasping sounds . NILES moves frantically around stage to get away from the sound . PAULLETTE tries to calm him down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunshot offstage and sound of body falling . Music stops . The lamp comes on , illuminating the shade . NILES stands and stares at it . Pause. ) p. 32 NILES ( suddenly cooled out ) Do you know why I bought that lampshade ? PAULETTE Why ? NILES Because I was born on an island . I was n't born in America you know . I was born way far away . I was imported . I lived in a tin house with a corrugated roof that sounded like Balinese cymbals when it rained . It rained tropical rains there . The kind that sound like they 'll never end . And you 'll be washed away . And you 'll all be washed away . And at night the laundry flaps . The sheets snap like wet whips . They 're all tied down by ropes so the Japanese do n't steal them . And your mother has a .45 automatic Colt revolver with an extra clip in her pocketbook just in case . And she takes you to the movies in an Army Jeep . Right through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch Song of the South . ( sings ) " Mr. Bluebird on my shoulder . It 's the truth . It 's actual . Everything is satisfactual . Zippety doo-da . Zippety ay . My oh , my oh what a wonderful day . " ( back to talk ) And the rain is pouring down in a sheet of green jungle water . Right over the movie screen . Like watching a movie through a waterfall . Right over the windscreen of the Jeep . And Mom has the .45 sitting right there loaded on her lap in case any gooks stick their heads in the window . She 'd blow their heads right off . Blow them right back out into the rain again . p. 33 PAULETTE That 's why you got the lamp ? NILES That 's why I got the shade . I already had the lamp . PAULETTE You wan na ' lie down for a while ? NILES No , I want to listen . PAULETTE To what ? NILES Whatever there is . PAULETTE You want me to leave you alone for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I got on a boat then . A tin boat with big holes in the deck that showed the ocean way down below . Sharks flashing by beer cans . Coral reefs . Island kids diving for American money . Silver dollars sinking to the deep blue seas . PAULETTE Niles , you got ta ' get your head together now . You have to be clear about what you 're doing . No fuzziness . NILES I know , I know . That 's important . It 's a good thing you stopped me . I was about to go off the deep end again . PAULETTE ( moving toward suitcase ) Now come over here and try some of these things on . ( NILES moves to suitcase with PAULLETTE . The stage lights come back up as NILES starts taking off his clothes , one piece at a time and putting on pieces of a costume that PAULLETTE hands him from the suitcase . The costume is a kid 's cowboy outfit . This change of costumes should be slow and deliberate as the focus switches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to PABLO ) Petrone should n't be telling you anything actually . PABLO ( still sitting on LOUIS lap ) How come ? We 're entitled to some information . We 've been working for weeks on this case . LOUIS Could you move a little , Pablo ? My knees are going to sleep . PETRONE ( to PABLO ) You know how Raymond Chandler worked ? He always started out knowing who the killer was first and then spent the rest of the time covering it up . He always worked backwards . That 's how you guys should do it . PABLO Just keep telling the story or I 'm taking you all down to headquarters ! LAUREEN This is headquarters . PABLO Do n't get smart with me , sister ! PETRONE ( moving slowly toward PABLO ) What exactly do you guys know anyway ? Do you guys know anything ? PABLO We know plenty . PETRONE Do you know anything about the nature of a nation ? PABLO Do n't try to dance around me with half-baked intellectual notions , mister ! I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pablo . He 's smarter than you . PABLO He 's not smarter than me ! He comes on like he 's smarter but he 's not . I 've got a master 's degree ! PETRONE Small nations . Nations within nations . LAUREEN Do n't give them too much rope , Petrone . PETRONE ( to PABLO ) What 's a musician to you ? PABLO You 're trying to confuse the issue but what you 're not counting on is our singlemindedness . My singlemindedness . All this stuff does n't matter . All this periphery . Extra frills . I 'm here to discover what 's at the heart of it . That 's all that matters to me . The investigation . PETRONE What 's a guy doing up there in front of dozens of people blowing his brains out on a horn for ? What 's he doing it for ? PABLO How should I know ! That 's not my job to know that ! LOUIS Pablo , get up ! PABLO ( to LOUIS ) No . LOUIS ( suddenly hysterical ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GET OFF ME ! ( LOUIS throws PABLO off him . PABLO lands on the floor by the outline . LOUIS stands. ) p. 36 LOUIS I gotta 's get out of here , Pablo ! Something 's not right ! We 've gotten ourselves into deep water here ! Ca n't you feel it ? Everything 's crazy ! I 've got to get my bearings back . It feels like we 're involved in something we 'd be better off not knowing about . I never wanted to kill myself before . I 've always had a good relationship with myself . A solid footing . I feel like I 've slid into somebody else 's head here or something . I 'm used to Tommy Dorsey , the Mills Brothers , Benny Goodman . All this free-form stuff is disturbing to my inner depths . It leaves me feeling nauseous . Like I 'm going to throw everything up . Everything that 's ever come into me. ( starts moving frantically around stage , others stay still ) I 'm a Republican by nature ! That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower was my main man ! We went through the war together . The Real War in the Real World ! Why do I have to go through everything again ! I 'M NOT GUILTY ! Am I guilty , Pablo ? Answer me that ! PABLO ( from floor ) You 're not guilty . LOUIS Of course not ! Of course I 'm not ! These dues belong to somebody else . Somebody else has to pay for this . IT 'S NOT MY FAULT ! I ca n't help it if things are in a state . I had to go to night school in my spare time to earn my diploma . The war took my time away . Took all my time away . I have shrapnel scars on the back of my neck . Pieces of hand grenade still embedded in my knees . I 'm entitled to a little dance music ! A nice waltz now and then . Three-quarter time ! p. 37 PABLO ( still on floor ) Louis , do n't go crazy . The Squad needs you . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You could always kill yourself . LOUIS You 'd like that would n't you ? It would be a mark of your success . There was a time when death was looked upon as a defeat ! PETRONE When was that ? LOUIS You 're all so twisted around that you even have sane people thinking they 're crazy . You 've driven me and my partner to utter distraction ! Look at my partner on the floor there ! Once he was a proud man . He walked erect like the rest of us . Now he 's groveling around on the floor ! LAUREEN Pick him up . LOUIS You 've made us lose track of our mission . We came here to get to the bottom of an evil act . We 're working for the right side ! PETRONE Suicide ? LOUIS Murder in the first degree ! A man does n't blow his face off if he wants to kill himself . His face is something personal right up to the end . Even if he shot himself in the mouth it would n't blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious . Anonymous . p. 38 LOUIS You want him to remain mysterious ! It 's you that 's hiding him from us . LAUREEN He 's right here now . LOUIS I know he is . You 've got him tucked away somewhere and we 're going to drag him out ! PABLO ( from floor ) Louis , maybe we bit off more than we can chew . I 'm even starting to hear voices now . LAUREEN ( listening . Starts to play bass softly ) Listen to that . He 's doing away with dominant sevenths . PABLO ( ear to floor , rubbing the outline softly with his hand ) Listen , Louis ! Can you hear that ? He 's a virtuoso . LOUIS I do n't hear a thing ! Wind is blowing through my head . ( PETRONE starts to play sax silently . ) PABLO ( from floor ) His body was right here . Right where I 'm laying now . LOUIS I ca n't hear a thing . PABLO Listen . It 's incredible . ( puts his ear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on NILES and PAULLETTE . NILES is all dressed in the cowboy outfit now . PAULLETTE turns him around in a circle , checking out the costume . NILES sings softly to himself as PAULLETTE keeps circling him , adjusting his costume. ) p. 39 NILES ( singing softly ) Pecos Bill , Pecos Bill &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Never died &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he never will &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh , Pecos Bill NILES ( to PAULLETTE , talking ) I hate killing this one off first , Paullette . Ca n't we save this one till last ? PAULETTE They 'll all be painful . Does n't matter what order you do them in . NILES Then let 's do this one last . PAULETTE No . NILES But there 's no guarantee I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NILES But you do n't know how attached I am . I feel as though his skin is my skin . PAULETTE He does n't have any skin . NILES He has a heart does n't he ? PAULETTE He 's a parasite . He 's sucking your blood . p. 40 NILES But I used him all these years . It only seems fair that he 'd take something out of me . PAULETTE Wait a second . You 're making it sound like this was all my idea . It was you who was going down the tubes , remember ? NILES Yeah . PAULETTE It was you who was looking for a way out . I 'm only supplying the means . NILES But how can we be sure we 're going about it in the right way . I mean it already backfired once on us . PAULETTE That was a mistake . NILES His whole face was blown off ! PAULETTE That was a mistake , all right ! NILES I do n't want my face blown off ! PAULETTE Your face is n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? PAULETTE Turn around . You 're not supposed to see the weapon . NILES Oh , Jesus , now I 'm really scared . PAULETTE Just turn around . NILES I need some time . Just let me work through this a little first . Just a little while longer . p. 41 PAULETTE Okay , take as much time as you want . I do n't care . You 're only giving them more time to catch up to you . NILES You said they were convinced ! PAULETTE For a while . It does n't mean we can stand still . We got ta ' keep moving . NILES Just let me walk through this a little . PAULETTE Go ahead . ( NILES starts moving around . PAULLETTE stands watching him . Soft piano builds under this . ) NILES I want to be clear about this . I was clear before but now I 'm not so sure . I want to be sure . I want to get rid of all these ones so I can start over . Is that it ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NILES All these ones have to go because they 're crowding me up . They 've gotten out of control . They 've taken me over and there 's no room left for me . They 've stolen their way into my house when I was n't looking . PAULETTE You invited them . NILES I invited them but I forgot to ask them to go . If I do n't get rid of them they 'll strangle me or something . PAULETTE Something . p. 42 NILES They 'll do me in . PAULETTE They 're doing you in right now . NILES Yes . I can feel that . But I 'm not sure what I 'll do without them either . I 'm not sure that if I get rid of all of them that I wo n't be lonely . PAULETTE You will be for a while . NILES I do n't want to be lonely . PAULETTE You 'll get over it . NILES I will ? PAULETTE You 'll go through it . NILES I 'm afraid to be lonely . I ca n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than dying . PAULETTE It is dying . NILES That 's the reason I invited them in to begin with . So I would n't have to feel that loneliness . That 's the reason I invented music . It filled me up . I got so filled up that I could n't go on . Now I got ta start over . PAULETTE You got ta start from scratch . NILES But they showed me their music too . I borrowed from them . They showed me everything I know . PAULETTE But now you ca n't get to anything new . It 's always the same . You 're repeating yourself . p. 43 NILES I 'm repeating myself , again and again . It 's not even myself I 'm repeating . I 'm repeating them . Over and over . They talk to me all the time . ( suddenly screaming ) THERE 'S VOICES COMING AT ME ! PAULETTE Keep it together , Niles . NILES ( calmer ) You 'd think in a nation this big there 'd be someone to talk to . PAULETTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other people talk to themselves . I wonder where my voice is . PAULETTE Inside . Coming out . NILES Where ? I do n't hear a thing . Now there 's nothing inside . They 've all gone home . PAULETTE They 've just shut up for a while . NILES They 're hiding ? PAULETTE They 're waiting to jump on you . Any second they can jump on you . NILES And that 's why I got ta do them in ? PAULETTE One at a time . NILES They are n't gon na ' like it . PAULETTE They wo n't know what hit them . p. 44 NILES They 're gon na ' start screaming when they find out . PAULETTE Do n't let them know . NILES I feel like a traitor . PAULETTE Turn around . NILES Not yet . I want to know this one first before he goes . PAULETTE You already know him . NILES Not well enough . Is he King of the Cowboys or something ? Does he make his women walk in ditches because he 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so terrible about him ? PAULETTE Nothing . NILES What have I got against him ? PAULETTE Nothing . NILES Then why does he have to go ? PAULETTE He 's burning your time . NILES He 's a hero Paullette ! He discovered a whole way of life . He ate rattlesnakes for breakfast . Chicago would n't even exist if it was n't for him . He drove cattle right to Chicago 's front door . Towns sprang up wherever he stopped to wet his whistle . Crime flourished all around him . The law was a joke to him . State lines . He sang songs to the Milky Way . PAULETTE Turn him around , Niles. p. 45 NILES You ca n't kill a hero ! ( Piano building through this . ) PAULETTE He 's no hero ! He 's a weasel ! He 's a punk psychopath built into a big deal by crummy New England rags . NILES He 's a myth ! PAULETTE So are you ! NILES You ca n't kill a myth ! PAULETTE Turn him around , Niles ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to die ! PAULETTE Do you ? NILES YES ! ! I mean no ! NO ! PAULETTE Any way you want it . NILES ( after pause , staring at PAULLETTE ) All right . But do it easy . ( NILES turns his back to her . Piano builds . PAULLETTE goes to suitcase and pulls out a bow and arrow . NILES speaks with his back to her as she loads the arrow in the bow very slowly . ) NILES ( to himself ) It 's a bright day . The kind of day you 'd never expect to die in . He 's got one foot up on the brass rail . The worn elbows of his rawhide jacket are digging into the mahogany bar . The bartender used to be his barber when he was a kid . The dirt streets outside are full of life . Girls of every color are doing their afternoon shopping . Newspapers are printing the news . ( PAULLETTE aims the bow very slowly and trains it on NILES ' back . She pulls the arrow back inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farriers are hammering iron . Dogs are pissing on horses ' legs . Scaffolds are being constructed . He sees the nation being built in every small activity . Everything looks like progress to him . Nothing looks like it could ever die . He does n't see it coming . He never even knew what hit him . It was over in a flash . ( PAULLETTE lets the arrow go . It strikes him dead center in the back . LOUIS screams in the dark as the second arrow strikes NILES . NILES stays standing with the arrow stuck in him . He makes no reaction . Follow spots out . Stage lights up . NILES starts taking off his cowboy outfit and PAULLETTE helps him on with another costume from the suitcase . Focus switches to others on stage . LOUIS is staggering around with an arrow stuck in his back , moaning and trying to pull it out . PABLO jumps up from the floor and starts searching the stage for possible attacker . ) LOUIS ( moving all over , trying to reach the arrow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it ! We should 've left someone on the door , Pablo ! PABLO Do n't anyone move ! PETRONE We are n't going nowhere . PABLO Do n't anyone touch anything ! Do n't anyone even breathe ! We 've got a psychopath on our hands ! p. 47 LAUREEN Are n't you guys going overboard a little with this whole thing ? I mean , Christ , the poor guy 's dead . Leave him lay . LOUIS He 's not dead ! He just shot me in the back ! Look ! I 've been shot ! LAUREEN It 's just an arrow . Pull it out . LOUIS I ca n't reach it ! LAUREEN Bring it here . I 'll pull it out . PABLO Stay where you are ! All of you ! LOUIS Even me ? PABLO Especially you . We have to determine the exact angle of projectory . You 'll mess everything up if you start moving around . LOUIS Call a doctor , Pablo . I 'm not kidding . I 've got an arrow stuck in my back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone moving around and destroying the evidence . LOUIS Call the Squad then . We need extra help ! There 's too many of them for us to handle . They 're coming at us through the woodwork ! I did n't even see it coming . PABLO We can handle it . We 've been on tougher assignments than this . We 've been to Cuba , Louis ! You forget that ! We 've both been to Cuba and back . p. 48 LOUIS No one 's supposed to know about that . PABLO It 's all right now . Now we can pull out all the stops . LOUIS Am I bleeding ? PABLO It 's a superficial abrasion . You 'll pull through . I guarantee it . " Intelligence " is a risky business . You knew that when you joined up . LAUREEN How did you two get in here anyway ? PABLO I 'll do the questioning , sister , if you do n't mind . LAUREEN Stop calling me sister . I 'm not your sister . PABLO You 're as fishy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PABLO First you slink in here  --  you and your friend  --  and claim to be waiting for this Niles character to show up . LAUREEN That 's right . PABLO And then you turn around and tell us to lay off the case because the guy 's dead . Now which is it ? Dead or alive ? What 's the story ? PETRONE I was in the midst of telling you the whole story but you guys are hysterical . PABLO ( to PETRONE ) Just shut up until you 're spoken to ! My partner 's been shot , in case you have n't noticed . This whole thing has taken on a new dimension . p. 49 LAUREEN That 's what we 're after . PABLO What ? LAUREEN A new dimension . What 's the point in messing around in the same old dimension all the time . LOUIS Because it 's safe , that 's why ! You do n't get shot in the back when you 're not looking ! You do n't get sudden sweeping surges of terror coursing through your blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing right here and now ! LAUREEN Yes you do but it just comes later . It comes at the end of your life instead of the middle . LOUIS I 'm in my prime ! I deserve better than this . PABLO Louis , shut up ! I ca n't hear myself think . ( puts his fingers in his ears ) LAUREEN It comes when all your friends have died off and you 're just laying there with the radio playing . Just going in circles . Same old thoughts , just repeating themselves . Over and over . It 's too late then . All the doors are shut . But you can still hear your life going on . Somewhere outside . Somewhere way outside . LOUIS I 'm not listening anymore . I ca n't take it ! ( puts his fingers in his ears ) ( LAUREEN starts bowing bass as PETRONE mimes sax . LAUREEN speaks as she plays . PABLO and LOUIS keep their fingers in their ears as she speaks ) p. 50 LAUREEN You struggle to the window . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , looking for your life . But all you see down there is your looking back up at you . You jump back from the window . You fall . You lay there gaping at the ceiling . You 're pounding all over . You crawl back for another look . You ca n't resist . You pull yourself up to the windowsill and peer down again . There you are , still standing down there on the street . Still looking straight back up at yourself . Your terror drops for a second . Long enough to start getting curious . You look hard at yourself on the street . You check out all the details . You examine yourself in a way you never have before . Not to resolve any conflicts but only to make an absolute identification . You check the face , the hands , the eyes , the turns in the mouth . You look for any sign that might give him away to you as an imposter . A man in disguise . But then you see him signaling to you from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his own head , then pointing back to you . He keeps repeating this over and over as though it 's very important . As though it 's something you should have understood a long , long time ago but never did . You pick up the gesture from him and start repeating it back to him . Pointing at your head first then pointing down to him on the street . He starts to nod his head and smiles as though you 've finally got the message . But you 're still not clear what he means . You pry open the window with the last strength you 've got and the shock of cold air almost kills you on the spot . " If only I do n't die before I find out what he means ! " you say . " Just let me live five minutes longer . " Then you see him more clearly than before . You see for sure that he is you . That he 's not pretending . He yells up to you in a voice you ca n't mistake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " YOU 'RE IN MY HEAD ! YOU 'RE ONLY IN MY HEAD ! " Then he turns and walks away . You watch him go until you ca n't see him anymore . Then you make a clean jump all the way to the bottom . And your life goes dancing out the window . ( LAUREEN stops playing the bass abruptly . PABLO and LOUIS take their fingers out of their ears . Lights go black onstage . Follow spots up on NILES and PAULLETTE . NILES dressed this time in black tails , puffing on cigar while PAULLETTE circles him again , checking out the fit of the costume. ) p. 51 NILES ( to PAULLETTE ) I 'm not sure if I have the theory straight . I 'm not even sure where the theory came from . PAULETTE It came from you . NILES Are you sure ? I remember having some ideas about all this and then you took it further . You found someone who knew about this stuff . PAULETTE If you have visitors you do n't want , you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never give your address out to bad company . PAULETTE What ? NILES Nothing . I agree about getting rid of them but what I question is the means ; the technique . PAULETTE It 's no technique . It 's a ritual . NILES Yeah , but it seems so stupid . So primitive . I mean I 'm not a kid . I know that if you dress up funny , like another person , and then you pretend to shoot that person  --  PAULETTE I was n't pretending . I shot him . NILES Yeah , but I did n't die . I 'm not even wounded . Look . PAULETTE He died . That 's the whole point . You do n't want to kill yourself , do you ? p. 52 NILES No , Yes . No . PAULETTE Just these other ones . NILES Yeah , but I 'm not really sure if there actually are these other ones or if I 'm making it all up . PAULETTE Does n't matter . NILES Why not ? PAULETTE It 's the same . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't just invent someone and have them appear . PAULETTE Sure you can . You did . NILES ( suddenly terrified ) Is that the one we killed ! ( PAULLETTE backs away from him . ) NILES ( after pause ) Is that the one whose face we blew off ! ( no answer from PAULLETTE ) Is it , Paullette ! WHOSE FACE DID WE BLOW OFF ? PAULETTE Somebody else 's . NILES WHO WAS IT ? PAULETTE Look , we 're messing with something that 's very tricky . I ca n't help it if an accident sneaks in here and there . NILES I 'll kill myself before I go to jail ! I 'm not going to jail , Paullette. p. 53 PAULETTE In this state they hang you . NILES I do n't mind getting hung but I 'm not going to jail . PAULETTE You wo n't . NILES Was it someone important we killed ? PAULETTE Who knows . NILES You know ! PAULETTE I do n't know everything . It was an experiment . It just so happened it worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clean and simple . Leave it at that . NILES It was someone important . I can remember his face now . The kind of face that looks overfed . Too much rich food and not enough exercise . What was he doing here ? PAULETTE Knock it off , Niles ! We ca n't backtrack now . There 's not enough time . NILES He was pleading with us . I remember him pleading . Chewing on his tie . It was cruel beyond belief . PAULETTE Turn around and let 's do the next one . ( PAULLETTE moves to the suitcase . ) NILES He was miserable . He was surrounded by everything he ever wanted . What was he doing with us ? Why us ? PAULETTE He knew we 'd cooperate . p. 54 NILES I remember what he said ! I remember exactly what he said ! He said , " Look now at the state of things . Look closely at the state of things . You wo n't ever see it again exactly as it is now . This is it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all be gone tomorrow . You have to look with a penetrating vision in order to catch it because everything lies in the name of the truth . Everything is trying to convince you it is n't what it is . " Why did he say that ? PAULETTE He was lying . ( She turns suddenly towards him with an automatic pistol which she 's taken from the suitcase and fires a full round of ammunition into him . He just stands there . Stage lights up as spots go out . PABLO staggers around the stage doubled over , holding his stomach . PABLO screams . ) PABLO ( staggering ) THEY GOT ME , LOUIS ! THIS TIME THEY REALLY GOT ME ! I 'M GUT-SHOT ! RIGHT THROUGH THE SMALL INTESTINE ! CALL THE SQUAD ! TELL THEM WE DID OUR BEST ! WE ACTED BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY ! WE USED EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE ENEMY ! WE TRIED TO REASON ! WE TRIED TO CONNIVE ! BUT NOTHING WORKED ! IN THE END WE WERE DEFEATED BY GHOSTS ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CERTAIN ! WE COULD MAKE NEITHER HEAD NOR TAIL OF THE PREDICAMENT ! WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE DESTROYED FROM WITHIN OR WITHOUT ! NOW IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ! THERE IS ONLY THE REALITY OF MY DYING ! TELL THEM THAT ! WRITE IT DOWN ! LOUIS ! WRITE IT DOWN BEFORE YOU FORGET ! ( PABLO falls to the floor on top of the outline . The others stand watching him lie there . PABLO gasps heavily as though going into a coma. ) p. 55 LOUIS ( to others , watching PABLO ) What did he say ? LAUREEN ( setting down the bass on the floor ) I could n't make it out . ( She crosses to the armchair and collapses into it . ) PETRONE Too bad Niles did n't show . He would 've liked this . Sometimes it was hard for us to even get him to eat . He 'd go for days just staring straight ahead of himself . I 'd try to tell him it was n't all that bad . Nothing 's all that bad . I 'd try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't penetrate . He 'd just sit there and stare . LAUREEN ( in chair ) I 'm exhausted . PETRONE I knew , ya ' know , because I 'd been there before . I could recognize his state . I could see it in his eyes . A kind of deadness . Like he 'd died inside . Given up . LOUIS ( still staring at PABLO on the floor ) Is there a telephone ? PETRONE I 'd been like that so I knew . The difference was that I went through it . Clear on through it . But he never made it . He had no idea that things would change . He took it to the end . LOUIS ( to PETRONE ) I 've got to make contact with the outside world . Is n't there a phone somewhere ? p. 56 LAUREEN ( to LOUIS ) You 're mistaken if you think it 's different out there . It 's just the same . PETRONE It 's worse . LAUREEN It 's just the same . LOUIS WHY ARE WE BEING SYSTEMATICALLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FAIR ! LAUREEN The planet is going crazy . LOUIS That 's no explanation ! I 've got an arrow in my back and Pablo 's been gut-shot ! Do n't blame it on the planet ! PETRONE I have a feeling you 'll never get to the bottom of it . He never did . That 's one thing he could n't understand . The one thing that killed him . PABLO ( still on floor , ear to floor , listening , gasping ) I can hear him breathing still , Louis . He 's still with us ! Still around ! Check the next room ! Check all the exits ! We 're not alone ! LOUIS I 'm paralyzed , Pablo ! I never thought it would be this tough . LAUREEN ( in chair ) He had that kind of quality . That kind of presence . He 'd move into a room and everything would change . PABLO ( on floor ) He 's after us , Louis ! Right now he 's after us ! He thinks we 're out to get him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can remember him the very first time . Moving through the streets like a Kodiak bear . I followed him for blocks . An umbrella half-hid him from behind but his shape was unmistakable . ( Spot comes up on NILES down left walking slowly with PAULLETTE clinging to his arm like a little girl . NILES carries a small black umbrella . They move silently across the stage as PETRONE narrates in half-light . Piano music comes in softly . ) PETRONE A small girl played at his sleeves like a puppy pulling at its mother 's tits , trying to get a grip then falling back then trying again . I was mesmerized by his progress . His immense size only added to the sense of awe . The entire city stood out around him like a miniature replica . A backdrop to his steady walking . Now and then he 'd stop and buy a bag of green grapes which he 'd share with the girl . It was n't raining but he kept the umbrella perched on his shoulder as though he 'd forgotten it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , I remember . City spring . The mayor was negotiating with the street gangs to keep the city cool for the coming summer heat wave . His " men in blue " were buying off the leaders with laundry bags of raw opium . p. 58 PETRONE ( moving slightly toward NILES downstage , NILES keeps talking with PAULLETTE ) That was it ! The weather . The change in the season . The city change . Not like the country where you see it coming on gradual , bit by bit . Every day a slightly different color to the trees . A slow emerging . This was sudden . Abrupt . Bang . There it was . Now I connect it ! PABLO ( on floor ) To what ? Do n't leave us , whatever you do ! PETRONE ( to PABLO ) To the feeling I was feeling . I did n't make the connection then but now it 's clear . A raw despair . LOUIS With spring ? What age are we living in ? Spring is full of promise ! Spring has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ! Terrorism ca n't change that ! LAUREEN ( to LOUIS ) Pipe down , you dope . Have respect for a man 's reveries . PETRONE ( moving closer to NILES , watching him intensely , NILES pays no attention , just keeps walking ) The lateness of the day . The " daylight savings time . " Still not dark at eight P.M. Everything was adding up . Piling up . Brothers were jumping off apartment buildings into broad daylight . Sisters disappeared down elevator shafts . Methadone programs were taking their toll . Coltrane was gone . Dolphy was gone . But Niles was right there . Right there in front of me . Walking . Still moving . His music wrapped up and carried inside him . Protected . Hidden from all the pedestrians . I followed him closely . I watched his every move as though some magic would escape his gestures and plunge into me . As though his music would start playing from his skin and jump back to my skin , transforming me , changing me , filling me up . Taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loneliness and making me whole again . Making me feel alive . ( NILES turns abruptly on PETRONE , who 's been following him closely . PAULLETTE hides behind NILES. ) p. 59 NILES Are you following me ? Is that it ? PETRONE ( stepping back ) Sorry . I did n't realize I was getting so close . NILES You 're too close for comfort . PETRONE It was just that I recognized you and  --  NILES You recognized me ? How could you recognize me when I do n't even recognize myself ? PETRONE I do n't know . I 've seen you play . NILES That was someone else . ( NILES turns sharply away from PETRONE and walks away with PAULLETTE trying to hide behind him . PETRONE follows . ) PETRONE No ! It was you . You 're so big I could never mistake you . ( NILES stops suddenly again and turns to PETRONE . ) NILES Did you listen or just watch ? PETRONE What do you mean ? NILES Did you listen to the music ! PETRONE Yeah . Sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did the music say ? Did you hear it ? p. 60 PETRONE Yes . It was n't words . I mean it was n't words like we 're talking now . NILES Of course not ! What did it say ? PETRONE It said that there was a chance . NILES What kind of chance ? PETRONE A slim chance but still a chance . NILES And you 'd given up hoping and this chance you heard filled you with hope and now that you 've seen me on the street you think that just by coming in contact with me that your asslicking life will be saved from hopelessness . PETRONE Yes . NILES No chance . ( NILES turns again and walks away from him , PETRONE follows . ) PETRONE Just saying that does n't make any difference . It does n't change it . NILES Get away from me ! The sidewalk 's not big enough for the three of us ! PETRONE I know where you live , Niles ! ( NILES stops dead . PETRONE stops . NILES turns slowly toward PETRONE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He 's working for any number of malevolent organizations ! You can see it in his eyeballs ! p. 61 PETRONE I know , Niles . NILES ( moving slightly toward him ) What do you know ? PAULETTE This is a trick ! I 've seen it a million times ! They sucker you . They promise you ! They " yes " you to death and then they slam you in the " Tombs . " Do n't buy it , Niles ! NILES ( to PETRONE ) What do you know ! PETRONE I know that you sold it all down the river . The whole fandango . NILES Sold what ? PETRONE I know that you were rewarded before your time . Before your " coming of age . " That you " bought it " from the big boys . You swallowed it whole . PAULETTE This is lying claptrap ! I can recognize an evil force when I see one ! NILES ( to PAULLETTE ) Shut up ! PETRONE I can take you home , Niles . Back to the scene of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm on the streets . Anonymous . Why should I go back . PETRONE To clean house . NILES Who 's there ? Is there someone there in my house ? Who is it ! p. 62 PETRONE I 'll show you . PAULETTE Do n't follow him , Niles ! He 'll nail you for sure . NILES What 're they doing there ? Why ca n't they leave me alone ? PETRONE ( motioning to others upstage , NILES sees them ) Take a look . They 're crawling all over your furniture , across your floor , inside your walls . Take a look , Niles . ( Lights up bright on upstage people . ) NILES Get them out of there ! I 'm already dead ! Do n't they know that . ( yelling at them upstage ) I 'M ALREADY DEAD ! PETRONE Now 's your chance , Niles . You can clean the slate . You 've got them all in one place at the same time . It 's perfect . You can wipe them all out . NILES ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in it for you ? PETRONE I 'm a fan . A fanatic . I live for revenge . NILES ( after short pause ) Take me inside . ( NILES follows PETRONE into the upstage area with the others . PAULLETTE follows them at a distance . ) PAULETTE Niles ! It 's a trap ! It 's worse than a trap ! THEY 'LL TEAR YOU APART , NILES ! ( PAULLETTE watches NILES for a second then runs off stage , right . The others watch NILES closely as he strolls through the space . Silence. ) p. 63 NILES What 's happened to all of you ? LAUREEN ( still in chair ) We 've been waiting . NILES For me ? LAUREEN We 've been waiting to play . NILES You do n't need me for that . LOUIS ( to PETRONE ) Is this him ? PETRONE This is him . LOUIS Alive ? PABLO ( on floor ) I knew it ! I knew it ! I could hear him breathing ! NILES ( to PABLO ) Get up off my floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Does everyone grovel in your profession ? PABLO I was n't groveling . I was on the verge of prayer . NILES Religious ? Something drove you to get religious ? PABLO It 's my last hope . NILES ( turning to LOUIS ) How about you ? Religious ? LOUIS I have no faith . I subscribe to no system of thought . I 'm on the verge of total madness . p. 64 NILES The verge . Only the verge ? LOUIS What 's the point in going further ! NILES ( turning to PETRONE ) What 's the point , Petrone ? PETRONE No point . NILES No point . ( starts moving through space ) Petrone 's been over the edge on several occasions and he confirms your suspicion . No point . Absolutely nothing to be gained by going off the deep end . Right , Laureen ? LAUREEN Absolutely . NILES Laureen herself is a confirmed basket case and even she agrees . Madness sucks . LOUIS ( bursting out ) I 'm dedicated to the pursuit of truth at whatever cost ! Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . We 've all lost our calling . How could that be ? PETRONE We 're ready to play , Niles . Just say the word . NILES There is no word to say . If you feel like playing go ahead . ( PETRONE picks up saxophone and begins playing silently again . ) NILES What 's everyone waiting for ? Are you here to arrest me ? Is that it ? In my own house ? Am I dead or alive ? Is that it ? Is this me here , now ? Are these questions or answers ? Are you waiting for the truth to roll out and lap your faces like a bloodhound 's tongue ? Are you diving to the bottom of it ? Getting to the core of the mystery ? Getting closer ? Moving in for the kill ? Waiting for one wrong move when they 're all wrong moves ? Sifting through the reams of corruption ? Toppling politicians in your wake ? ( LAUREEN stands and starts bowing the bass in long mournful notes . Piano fills softly behind . LOUIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost unnoticed , as he raves on. ) p. 65 NILES Are you martyring yourselves with your own criminal instincts ? Are you inside me or outside me ? Am I inside you ? Am I inside you right now ? Am I buzzing away at your membranes ? Your brain waves ? Driving you berserk ? Creating explosions ? Destroying your ancient patterns ? Or am I just like you ? Just exactly like you ? So exactly like you that we 're exactly the same . So exactly that we 're not even apart . Not even separate . Not even two things but just one . Only one . Indivisible . ( PABLO and LOUIS arrive simultaneously on either side of NILES and snap handcuffs on both of his wrists . The other half of each pair of handcuffs is locked onto their own wrists so that all three are locked to each other . NILES makes no move to protest . The sound of the snapping handcuffs should happen in a moment of silence between the language and the music . ) NILES ( after short silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him face to face . I saw his whole life go past me . Someone should pay for that . That 's for sure . Someone should be made to pay for that . A life 's not cheap , that 's for sure . You guys know that . You 've seen enough to know that . You 've been around . You 've been through the war . You 're nobody 's fool . He had his whole face torn off . Beyond recognition . Right down to the bone . I think he was alive at the time . Right up to the last . He stayed alive right through it . Right up to the point where he died . He was alive to the very last moment . You know what that 's like . ( PABLO and LOUIS lead NILES off stage-right . Piano music swells along with sax and bass . Lights fade very slowly on PETRONE , LAUREEN and PIANO PLAYER . Lampshade stays lit in dark then goes out. )             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
