Reagan v. Ford : Elephants at War <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> What crossover vote May 17 ? Did anyone ever think that people voted for Ronald Reagan to protest Gerald Ford and the pardon he gave to former President Nixon ? Reagan had the issues : foreign policy , national security , the post offices and the Panama Canal giveaway . <P> So I believe that Ford does have a contender . Though Ford says Reagan does n't know what he 's talking about , apparently some folks believe he does , and they showed their views in the primary elections . <P> Betty Pair Seagraves , Texas <P> I am a Democrat but I voted for Gerald Ford in my state 's primary . I would have preferred to vote for Udall-to strengthen responsible liberalism in the Democratic Party-but I could not stand by while Reagan drove the Republican Party further into simplistic conservatism . The threat of Reagan outweighed the promise of Udall . <P> It is perhaps a commentary on our electoral process that I found myself voting for the very incumbent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> <P> Alan Creutz Ann Arbor , Mich . <P> <P> The emergence of Ronald Reagan as a serious contender for the Republican nomination is exhilarating . It just might suggest that America is recovering its pride and vigor . Reagan will stand tall against the internal and external enemies who have so harmed America 's morale in recent years . <P> <P> Alan Shelly Toronto , Ont . <P> <P> How can anyone back a candidate ( Reagan ) who supports the idea of having the United States become a warfare state ? What we certainly do n't need is another senseless military conflict ( over the Panama Canal ) . <P> Let 's concentrate on satisfying the basic human needs that are crying out in our country . <P> <P> Barry J. Rickert Valley View , Pa . <P> <P> If Reagan exaggerates and oversimplifies so consistently as a candidate , what would he do as a President ? One point he made I do agree with-he 'd need God 's help in doing the job - though it 's plain he underestimated the amount ! <P> <P> Linda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am disgusted by Reagan 's comments regarding his lack of support by the poor and blacks . He claims to know a little bit about prejudice by virtue of having an Irish Catholic father . So he got to hear all the Pope stories ! <P> He also declares his admiration for James Schlesinger . I expected his next sentence to be : " Some of my best friends are sons of Jewish immigrants . " <P> Audrie Novak Muncie , Ind . <P> If destiny gives us the wonderful choice between Jimmy Carter and Ronnie Reagan , history may well mark this election as peanuts v. popcorn . <P> Jonathan D. Aks East Brunswick , N.J. <P> <P> When , Not If <P> Reporter Bernard Diederich 's article regarding la dolce vita in the Panama Canal Zone May 17 adds nothing new to an already overworked stereotype . Most rational people living here , including the military and civilian employees , realize that the canal issue is a question of when , not if . To drag out the same cliches about the Zonians ' insular existence simply adds fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clayton , C.Z.
