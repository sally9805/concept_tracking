From the time Federal Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr . ordered the Boston schools to desegregate 18 months ago , many of the city 's whites-especially in South Boston-have been fighting a tenacious rear-guard action against the ruling . Last week , after hearing black students at South Boston High School testify that they had been beaten by white students and ignored by white teachers , Garrity 's patience was at an end . He stripped the all-white School Committee of its control over " Southie , " the city 's racial trouble spot , and placed the school in federal receivership . He also ordered Southie Headmaster William Reid , its other administrators and Football Coach Arthur Perdigao transferred to some other school . <P> Garrity 's extraordinary ruling aroused fury in South Boston . That night the N.A.A.C.P. 's storefront headquarters in downtown Boston was firebombed . Next morning whites lined the pavements near South Boston High School , shaking fists and shrieking curses as six buses , with police motorcycle escorts , arrived carrying blacks from Dorchester and Roxbury . Once the students entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons , the school erupted with racial fighting . Reporters outside heard the sounds of breaking glass . " It 's wild in there , " one breathless teacher told them . " They 're going crazy . " Police finally herded blacks and whites into separate " holding rooms " off the lobby to keep them apart . <P> Last week 's turmoil came after a month of hearings on a motion by the N.A.A.C.P. seeking to close Southie entirely . The motion maintained that conditions in the school were so bad that it was impossible for students to learn . Testimony by black students underlined that charge . One black girl said that a policeman assigned to Southie held down a black student while a white student kicked him ; another black testified that a white student came to school on crutches , claiming that they were his new " nigger beaters . " A third charged that a white student picked up a chair and bashed a black over the head with it . Others said that Football Coach Perdigao told white players to " get " blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Headmaster Reid , however , admitted that most of the charges were " basically honest . " <P> In the midst of the hearings , Garrity had gone to the school himself-his first trip inside the building . He found that only 271 of the 771 whites assigned to Southie , and just 106 of the 446 blacks , were actually attending classes . He later went back to the school " because I could not really believe what I saw on the first visit . "
