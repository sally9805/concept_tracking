Just before China 's Defense Minister , Lin Piao , staged an abortive coup d'etat last fall , Chairman Mao Tse-tung made a month-long tour of the provinces , informally telling party leaders about his continuing political troubles with his subordinates and his clashes with Heir Apparent Lin . A transcript of Mao 's rambling remarks , circulated by Peking 's Central Committee last spring , was smuggled to Taiwan , where it was released last week . Excerpts : <P> ON LIN AND THE ARMY . Lin Piao says that the People 's Liberation Army was created and led by Mao , but is commanded by Lin . I say that what has been created by the people can not be commanded by one person-even by me . <P> <P> ON HIGH POLITICAL OFFICE . I am against setting up a powerful presidency . I do not want to be president . I have said that on six occasions ; they do n't want to listen . <P> <P> ON TROUBLES WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP . <P> <P> Ten times over the years , men in our party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible that there will be similar stir-ups another ten , 20 , 30 times . Do you believe this or not ? You do not believe this . I do . <P> ON ERRORS . Some comrades have been deceived by the splitters . The question of being hoodwinked has nothing to do with you provincial leaders . This is Peking 's problem . It does not matter that mistakes have been made . Our party has a rule : we hold examinations of wrongdoers , then we allow them to correct their errors . <P> <P> ON SECRETARIES AND SUBORDINATES . I do not approve of having one 's own wife working as office manager of her husband 's work unit . In Lin Piao 's place , Yeh Chun Lin 's wife is the office manager . His subordinates have to go through her to consult with him on any question . Yeh and the subordinates have since been purged . To do any real work you have to rely on yourself : move your own hands , see with your own eyes , mark documents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not let secretaries have too much power . My secretary controls only the comings and goings of documents ; I myself select the documents for my own reading . What I want done , I do myself , to avoid misunderstandings . <P> <P> ON CADRES AS STUDENTS . I hope that from now on you will all read more books . Senior cadres do not even know what is materialism and what is not . How would you know ? It is not easy to read books on Marxism-Leninism . What is to be done ? * You could ask a teacher for help . You are all secretaries ; you should all be students . At present I myself am a student every day , reading daily two reference books , to gain a little international knowledge . <P> <P> *One of Lenin 's most famous pamphlets is entitled What Is to Be Done ?
