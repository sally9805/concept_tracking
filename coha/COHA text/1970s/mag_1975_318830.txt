Gerald Ford is a courageous and stubborn man who resents any attempt to intimidate him . So despite the two attempts upon his life within 17 days , the President once again left the secure confines of the White House to tour the U.S. " I can only say that two-way communication with my friends and fellow Americans is for me an essential part of doing the job properly , " he told an audience in Chicago . " I intend to keep my communications open , not in any foolhardy spirit , but by every prudent and practical means . " <P> Despite Ford 's genuine desire to meet his countrymen , the extraordinary security measures that shrouded his trip showed how deeply his freedom had been at least temporarily restricted . One symptom of the new nervousness around the White House : the entourage of newspaper reporters jumped from the regular eight or ten to 26 , including correspondents from four British and three Australian newspapers . <P> Ford flew first to Chicago , where the Secret Service had requested the local police to impose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrolmen and plainclothesmen were assigned . Also on hand were at least 100 Secret Service agents and an undisclosed number from the FBI . The area outside the <P> Conrad Hilton Hotel , where the President was to address a G.O.P. fund-raising dinner , was patrolled by hundreds of uniformed police , scores of detectives equipped with walkie-talkies , undercover agents in jeans and leather jackets , plus plainclothes policewomen in slacks . <P> Closed Windows . Armed with metal detectors , police scanned the crowds outside on Michigan Avenue as well as the 1,000 Republicans inside the hotel , who lined up patiently to be electronically frisked for weapons before ascending an escalator to the grand ballroom for the dinner . For blocks around the Hilton , policemen on rooftops restlessly searched the area with binoculars . Every window in the 19-story Y.M.C.A. , one block south of the Hilton , was ordered closed . Some guests in the Hilton insisted on peering out of their windows to see what all the commotion was about . When they did , they were blasted by police loudspeakers : " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a police order . " At one point , a guest left his window open too long . " If you do n't close your window right now , " boomed the loudspeaker , " you will be arrested . " The window slammed shut . <P> A crowd of 700 gathered expectantly at the Michigan Avenue entrance to the <P> Hilton , the traditional gateway for Presidents , Kings and heads of state . But all they got was a fleeting glimpse of Ford 's motorcade zooming past on its way to the rear service entrance , normally used by maids and waiters . The small crowd clustered there saw Ford for perhaps five seconds . Reported TIME 'S Midwest bureau chief Benjamin Cate : " He alighted from the presidential limousine , forced a smile across his face and waved sheepishly while security men swarmed around him . The wave seemed almost a gesture of embarrassment , as though Ford were saying to those watching that he 'd like to do more but had been ordered not to do so . Then the gray steel door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the relative safety of the back corridors of the hotel . "
