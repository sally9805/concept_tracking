Hank Aaron did it in baseball with home run No. 715 ; Jim Brown did it in football with seven 1,000-yard seasons ; Mark Spitz did it in a swimming pool with his seventh Olympic gold medal . Any day now , Jockey Willie Shoemaker , 44 , will do it in horseracing , riding a thoroughbred to victory No. 7,000 , setting another of sport 's Olympian records for generations to test against . By week 's end " Shoe , " 4 ft. 11 in. , was one win away , and well past the 6,032 mark set in 1966 by John Longden who was 59 at the time when he retired . No one else is within 2,000 wins of Shoemaker . <P> On the way to 7,000 , Shoemaker , a jockey since 1949 , has had some famous losses , like the time he was riding Gallant Man in the 1957 Kentucky Derby and miscalculated the location of the finish line . But on three other occasions , he won that race ; ten times since 1951 he has been the top money-winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shoe 's overall winning average comes close to one race out of every four-or 260 victories a year . What next ? If he rides until he reaches Longden 's retirement age of 59 and wins only 200 races a year , he will reach 10,000.
