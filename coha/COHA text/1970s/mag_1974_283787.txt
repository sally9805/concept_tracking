The nervous tic afflicting the Tokyo grade school girl was so severe that her entire body shook every time she twitched . When she was finally brought to Tokyo Psychiatrist Soichi Hakozaki , the diagnosis was surprisingly simple . The girl was lefthanded , and her mother had been trying to make her use her right hand by binding the left with tape . Two days after mom 's therapy was stopped , the tic disappeared . <P> The reason for the forcible correction of the child 's " defect " remained , however . In Japan there is a deep-seated prejudice against lefthanders that goes back so far in time that its origins are unknown . It is especially strong in rural areas , where teachers used to beat lefthanded pupils , and girls still pretend to be righthanded in order to get married . If their secret is discovered , they run the risk of being divorced . <P> Intrigued by the problems of his young patient , Psychiatrist Hakozaki began examining the plight of Japan 's 5,000,000 southpaws . He soon discovered that there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of being forced to use their right hands . <P> Uphill Battle . Over the past five years , Hakozaki , who is righthanded himself , has become Japan 's leading spokesman for lefty liberation . In 1968 he wrote a bestselling attack on the old prejudices called Warnings Against Rightist Culture . Three years ago , he founded the Japan Lefthanders League to encourage lefthanders to come out of the closet . Today the league 's 1,500 members receive a monthly bulletin to boost their self-esteem and remind them of such famous lefties as Michelangelo and Harry Truman . <P> Throughout Japan , thousands of supporters have written to Hakozaki offering thanks and encouragement . Bolstered by the response , Hakozaki is carrying the fight to new fronts as well . He has persuaded several Tokyo department stores to stock specially designed scissors , golf clubs and tools for lefthanders . Now at work on a second book on the subject , Hakozaki is also designing a special manual for the art of brush writing , which poses particular problems for lefthanded schoolchildren . Though Hakozaki sees a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are indications that the prejudice against lefthanders is beginning to ease . One sign of progress is a record that has become one of Japan 's top ten hits . Its title : My Boy Friend Is a Lefty .
