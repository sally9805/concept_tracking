The customer in Mr. Eckhard 's barbershop in San Francisco 's elegant Fairmont Hotel was turning hot under the collar , both literally and figuratively . Proprietor Eckhard Helmholz , brandishing a wide-toothed bone comb in one hand and a flaming 10-in. jeweler 's torch in the other , was preparing to go to work , while cooing assurances that " it is n't nearly as bad as it smells . " It turns out to be the blowtorch cut , the hottest innovation in California coiffure circles since Warren Beatty in Shampoo . <P> Helmholz 's tonsorial firing for effect is the result of complaints from customers whose fine , flyaway hair made them look more like Ben-Gurion than Ben Gazzara . Helmholz first tried to solve the problem with an old barber 's trick : burning the ends with flaming candles . The knobby , stunted ends weighed down the hair and made it lie flat , all right , but Helmholz 's Nob Hill clients waxed eloquent about tallow dripping down the backs of their necks . So Helmholz , 33 , began experimenting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It is maneuverable , it singes places hitherto impossible to reach , and it is absolutely safe , as long as you always point the torch away from the skin . " <P> Helmholz prepares for his singe jobs like a surgeon before an operation . Each customer gets a thorough workup , with the results-tensile strength , absorption factor and elasticity of hair-printed on special reference cards . Says Helmholz : " We leave nothing to chance . " Then the hair is washed and scissor-trimmed by aides , after which Helmholz himself arrives , torch in hand . Moving it from right to left across the customer 's head , using a comb as a baffle , he burns off a few strands at a time , starting at the front of the crown and working down to the earlobes and around the back . The acrid stench of burning hair fills the air . After ten minutes of work , Helmholz shuts off his torch , shampoos the hair to get rid of the smell and dries it under a heat lamp . <P> No Casualties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $15 for an initial blaze and $10.50 for a return visit-with no casualties . Seventy percent of the customers come back , even though they must make appointments three days in advance . Says one recent , first-time customer : " My hair usually flies about and makes me look like Einstein . After my blowtorch cut , it miraculously stayed in place . " <P> Women too are flocking to Helmholz 's shop . With female customers , he twists the hair into separate ropes and then burns the ends . Afterward , he shampoos the hair as usual , but dries it , natch , with a blow dryer . <P> Word of Helmholz 's technique has reached other barbers as well . At least 40 have come to him to learn the torch trick and are now practicing on customers in scattered shops in California , Georgia , Texas and other states . <P> Helmholz has even more exotic skills to impart . He does a brisk business styling men 's chest hair into shamrocks , peace signs , hearts and other shapes on request . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
