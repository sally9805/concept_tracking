txt Sen. Henry M. Jackson worries that it may cause a " catastrophic " repeat of 1972 . A Chicago commodities broker says he has been flooded with calls from people wanting to know how they can make a killing on it . Wheat farmers all over the country are rethinking their marketing plans because of it . And consumers are wondering if it will mean another surge in food prices . " It " is the growing possibility that the Soviet Union will buy substantial amounts of grain from the U.S. this year . Reports of the Russians ' interest in U.S. grain purchases inevitably have given rise to comparisons with the massive 1972 Russian purchase that was followed by soaring grain and food prices and a lot of recriminations over who let the Russians get away with it . The immediate impact of the current reports was a rise in the price of grains for immediate and future delivery . Many grain futures contracts advanced their daily permitted limits on the commodities exchanges last week following the initial reports . Hard red winter wheat for September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvest , closed out last week at $3.675 a bushel in Kansas City , up 17% from last Monday 's close . Prices Lower Yesterday Yesterday , there were reports that farmers in the Southwest who had been holding out for higher prices were beginning to sell their grain . The September-delivery price in Kansas City fell as much as 13% cents from Friday 's close , to prices as low as $3.56 a bushel . While it now seems clear that the Russians are in the market for U.S. grain , the potential size of the order and the type of grains involved remain the subject of some debate . Just as debatable is the effect of any large grain purchase on the U.S. market . Some people predict a reprise of the summer of ' 72 if a large grain sale goes through . But most knowledgeable analysts see little comparison with 1972 . " It 's an entirely different situation " from 1972 , says R.H. ' Uhlmann , president of Standard Milling Co. in Kansas City . The main differences he and others point to : ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few weeks ago , are substantially less than they were in 1972 , when Russia bought about 400 million bushels of U.S. wheat and 160 million bushels of feed grain , mostly corn . ? Unlike 1972 , when the U.S. was dipping into its reserves of wheat and feed grains , U.S. stocks this year are larger than most people anticipated . ? The U.S. grain harvest this year should be much larger than in .1972 . And other major producers , such as Canada and Australia , are in better shape this time , with bumper crops in the bins or on the way . Butz 's Prediction In short , there appears to be some support for Agriculture Secretary Earl L. Butz 's statement Friday that Russian purchases probably wo n't have a major impact on U.S. grain supplies and food prices . Moreover , if the Russians do buy this year , they wo n't be getting the bargain they got in 1972 , when they bought wheat at an average price of $1.62 a bushel . If they were in the U.S. market yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushel for wheat at the Gulf of Mexico . To some , the most outrageous aspect of the 1972 deal was that the U.S. consumer paid for it twice ? at the supermarket counter and with his tax dollar . Because the Russians bought wheat in 1972 at world prices that went - lower than U.S. prices , the government paid millions of dollars in subsidies to make up the difference to exporters who sold the grain . That wo n't happen this year , as world and domestic prices generally are in line with each other . Some benefits could accrue from a large grain sale , of course . The U.S. balance-of-payments position would improve , for example , and any bolstering of farm prices could help ward off an agricultural recession that some analysts have been predicting . Last w3ek 's grain developments started with a report that the Russians bad chartered 19 ships , presumably to haul grain . Then came a V.S. Agriculture Department estimate that this year 's Russian grain crop would total 195 million metric tons , down 15 million tons from the department 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.1 U.S. short tons . The number of bushels in a ton varies somewhat among grains , but for wheat there are 38.74 bushels in a metric ton . ) Last week , there were also unconfirmed reports that the Russians were selling gold , presumably in preparation for grain purchases . Some Negative Signs These bullish signs overshadowed a Russian newspaper report that the wheat harvest was progressing well and the latest U.S. government export report , which showed that there weren't- any export bookings of more than 100,000 tons of grain . Then on Friday , Secretary Butz told the Senate Agriculture Committee thit ? U.S. traders were in Russia discussing the sale of grain to the Soviets . " That was the new input needed to keep the thing going " on Friday , says Daniel G. Amstutz , president of Cargill Investor Services Inc. , a Chicago commodities brokerage firm . ( Cargill Investor itervices is organizationally , a unit of CargM Inc. , the big grain exporter , but Mr. Amstute emphasizes that the parent and unit operate indepe , oleatly . ) The Agriculture Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a drought in parts of wheat-and-barley- areas . ( Barley is the key feed grain in Russia . ) But even the new estimate of 195 rroPion ( nes will be about equal to last year 's Ermetia.n crop and well above the crop of just 168 qull ? on tons harvested in 1972 , when the Ft. ) ( bought heavily from the U.S. Others say comparisons with 1972 are n't entirely valid because the ** are increasing consumption of meat and thus require more grains for feeding livestock . The consensus seems to be that the 13.11.5-ier 's will be in the market for about 10 mil/ion metric tons of grain , about three million of which it would primarily buy from Canada . Secretary Butz said Friday that the L.S. is negotiating the sale of " up to " 10 million tons . Feed Grains Sought It 's believed the Russian purehages this year would be more evenly divided between wheat for humans and feed grains for animals than in 1972 . If it 's assumed that they 're going to buy seven million metric tons from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then about 3.5 million tons of wheat would be involved . That comes to about 123 million bushels , considerably less than the 400 million bushels of wheat purchased in 1972 . One government source says the U.S. " will be lucky " to export one billion bushels of wheat this year . including an " improbable " amount of 150 million bushels to Russia . He says total export and domestic needs will amount to at most 1.9 billion bushels of this year 's estimated wheat crop of 2.2 billion bushels . Thus , even with the rumored Russian purchases , U.S. stocks would be built up by another 300 million bushels in the year ending next June 30 , not reduced as they were in 1972 . " I do n't see much effect on the price of bread , " Mr. Uhlmann says . Some analysts say that wheat accounts for a minor part of the cost of a loaf of bread anyway . Mr. Bins said Friday that a $1-a-bushel price rise in wheat would increase bread prices by only 142 cents a loafSignificant purchases of feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed costs are more directly reflected in meat prices . But here too the numbers seem to argue against any nia3or impact if the Russian purchases were limited to the 140 million bushels or so being rumored  --  probably all in corn That 's because the carry-over from last year 's crop is expected to be a surprisingly large 260 million bushels of corn , and this year 's crop should be a record of more than six billion bushels . The Agriculture Department has estimated that next year 's carry-over ( not counting any possible R : ) si.n sales ) could swell to 860 million bushels . Impact on Prices Mr. Amstutz of Cargill Investor Services thinks the 111 , .. , . , , ? 1 might be interested in buying as much as 15 million tons of U.S. wheat and feed grains , " but we 've got enough to take care of that too , " he says . The outlook for a bumper crop of corn has had analysts predicting the price of corn would drop eventually to $2 or so from the current cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believes the Russian purchases might be substantial enough to mean $2.50-a-bushel corn after this fall 's harvest . Even that would n't drive food prices up , he says . Farmers themselves might be important in determining farm prices if there is confirmation of Russian purchases , Mr. Amstutz believes . " It depends on whether they 've got the courage to be slow , orderly sellers , " he says . One wheat farmer last week said he was n't going to sell his crop for the $3.25 price in his area because he was holding out for the $5 a bushel he would get " when the Russians get in . " But another farmer said he sold part of his wheat crop , and added , " I 'm going to sell the rest of it as it comes " Others say what the farmers might do is n't as significant as what other potential gram buyers did n't do last week ; that is. they did n't buy much . " Domestic buying is practically at a standstill , " says one grain man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices to fall back again . " Foreign buyers apparently also stayed on the sidelines . " Our regular customers have n't panicked , " says one exporter . Japan , the largest customer for U.S. agricultural products and normally a weekly buyer , did n't buy any wheat from the U.S. last week , he says . " And you can bet your bottom dollar they called every exporter in the country and asked : Are the Russians in ? Do we need to worry ? " Reflecting on last week 's events , Mr. Uhlmann of Standard Milling muses : " They say in peacetime generals prepare for the last war fought . I believe the speculators are reliving 1972 all over again . "
