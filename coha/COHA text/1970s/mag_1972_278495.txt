The fastest , most intricate computer ever built is a primitive machine compared with the human brain . One human brain cell , for example , may be " wired " to as many as 60,000 other cells . In an effort to unravel and understand the complexities of the brain , scientists in a number of laboratories are literally reconstructing the living brain tissue of lower animals in test tubes . <P> Pioneered by Biologists Aaron Moscona of the University of Chicago and Malcolm Steinberg of Princeton , the technique is deceptively simple . After taking tissue from the fetus of , say , an unborn mouse , researchers coax the individual cells apart with the help of enzymes and then put the separated cells into a growth-sustaining solution . Carefully incubated , the mix soon displays extraordinary activity . The cells begin to join and organize themselves into a pattern resembling the original tissue . <P> Last summer Neurobiologist Nicholas Seeds of the University of Colorado Medical Center reported that he had not only been able to reassemble brain cells from mice , but that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Seeds and a colleague , Albert E. Vatter , disclose that the cells in the test tube mature and form synapses , the vital cell-to-cell connections that transmit messages through the brain and the rest of the nervous system . The material also appears to develop the myelin " insulation " that covers part of the cell in order to protect the messages from interference by other nearby cells . <P> Harvard 's Richard Sidman , who was the first to apply the reassembly technique to brain cells , is now experimenting with a special variety of laboratory-produced mice called " reelers . " A genetically caused " wiring " defect in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex of the reelers ' brains impairs their coordination so completely that they stagger like drunks whenever they try to walk . Remarkably , when the brain tissue was taken from fetuses that had just developed the defect , Sidman 's cells reorganized themselves in the same curious pattern . <P> If researchers can ever learn to intercept the genetic command that orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may eventually be able to substitute commands of their own . That , in turn , might enable them some day to prevent wiring defects in mice and possibly even in higher mammals , including man .
