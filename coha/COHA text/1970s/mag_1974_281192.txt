Growing out of the spinal cord like the crown of a tree out of its trunk , the brain has several major components ( see diagram page 52 ) . The limbic system , an area that surrounds the head of the brain stem and includes such structures as the amygdala , part of the thalamus , hypothalamus and hippocampus , regulates the emotions . The pituitary , which hangs down from the brain stem like an olive from the tree , produces the hormones that influence growth and development . The cerebellum , a fist-sized structure at the rear of the brain that controls movements and coordination , enables man to touch his nose with his finger or throw touchdown passes . But it is the cerebrum that distinguishes man from other animals . Fish have little or no cerebral tissue , nor do birds . Chimpanzees , man 's closest animal relatives , have larger cerebrums than most other primates , but man 's is the largest . <P> Consisting largely of gray matter and fissured like a lunar landscape , the cerebrum dominates the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also makes man what he is , for it contains the areas that control thought and consciousness , the quality that enables man to remember his past , understand the present and anticipate his future . <P> <P> Divided down the middle like the two halves of a walnut , the cerebral hemispheres are anatomically separate , but are cross-wired so that each controls the opposite side of the body-the left monitoring the right side , the right regulating the left . One hemisphere-the left in most people-is dominant and contains the areas that are associated with speech and hearing and involved with analytical tasks such as solving an algebra problem . The other governs spatial perception , synthesis of ideas and aesthetic appreciation of art or music . <P> Normally these two hemispheres communicate with each other through a bundle of nerve fibers known as the corpus callosum . But if this connection is severed , their autonomy becomes evident . <P> " Split brain " patients lose few of the two-handed skills already learned ; they do have great difficulty learning new tasks that require both hands . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells : neurons , or nerve cells , of which there are some 100 billion , and glia , which outnumber the neurons by a ratio of 10 to 1 . Neurons , which are the functional units of the brain ( glia , scientists believe , are largely " filler " ) , are connected to each other by means of long filaments , or dendrites , and form the body 's nerve network . These cells receive sensory impulses , process the myriad bits of information pouring into the brain each moment , and transmit the brain 's messages out to the various parts of the body , causing such reactions as the contracting and relaxing of muscles . <P> It has long been known that these messages are transmitted electrically . More recent research has shown that communication between the neurons is also chemical in nature . Neurons have bulbous endings called synapses . These secrete chemicals that cross the submicroscopic gaps between the individual cells , lock onto special sites on the dendrites of neighboring cells and cause these cells to release chemicals of their own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another .
