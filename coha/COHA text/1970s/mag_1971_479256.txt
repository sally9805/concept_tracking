PROPEPROPERLY IT IS Homarus Amerz- RLY and a close cousin to lice and the sow bug . Wickedly frightening , its appearance suggests the prototype for a monocoque war machine designed by Genghis Khan as seen in a Japanese horror movie . It lives under rocks and eats anything , fresh or decaying , plant or animal , alive or dead . It is a notable cannibal . Do not give it a chance to try to eat you . If it weighed a hundred pounds ( some may ) it would be the most dangerous big game animal anywhere , and you can eat your fill of Homarus Americanus for about fifteen dollars . Catching Homarus along the south Cape Cod coast of Americartus is a complicated , strenuous , involved procedure very few men perform well , but Carl Taylor knows the work and he is the best lobsterman on Buzzard 's Bay . Carl is small , about five feet six . He has dark hair and prominent forearms with slightly swollen hands , an older man 's hands ( he is twenty-seven ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles beautifully and is quiet for a small man . He has a small wife and two children , a baby boy and a girl four years old . If a lobsterman works hard he can make a good living . Carl 's wife Carolyn helps with the gear , paints the buoys with Carl 's orange and green stripe on white , runs errands , and makes his breakfast at 3:30 A.m . She is a bright , happy girl and she fusses around Carl in the evening while he talks lobster theory : " Now the biologists say they migrate and that they scavenge their food , but it 's only a guess . A biologist who has studied them maybe fifteen years will tell you . ' This is what I think happens . ' But he does n't know for sure . No one does . Jan Adkins is the author of The Art and Industry of Sandcastles , published by Walker &; Co. 48 " I believe that they do n't migrate . I think they can go for months without food ; you 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after two months , alive and frisky . But I do n't know ... . You can go out if you want . A lobsterman puts in a long day . We start here at four . " T HERE IS ONLY a faint wash of light due east when I arrive at Carl 's house . He does not live on the water ? perhaps for the same reason the steelman does n't live at the mill . It seems to be the least quiet part of his day . He is very cheerful , as he loads new traps into his truck from the basement gear workshop . The traps go into the truck with their buoys inside them and line coiled beside . Also a plastic barrel , airtight , of fresh flounderbacks from the fillet houses in New Bedford . I stay upwind , drinking tea , and Carl chats about his family . His father , McCoy , is a lobsterman going on twenty-three years ; his brother ' Coy ? older than Carl ? is just back from the service , starting his strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his wife through the kitchen door , then we get into the truck and are riding down Great Neck Road to Wareham with the lights on . Carl coasts through the stoplight at the bridge across the inlet and hails the parked police car . " Louis is n't pulling pots today , he 's over to New Bedford . " The lobster-men know what lobstermen do . There are only two lobsterboats snugged up along the dock : Carl 's Carolyn J. and Louis ' boat , thirty yards down . They are small , about twenty-eight feet , and obviously workboats ? broad in the beam with high bows and a small cabin forward . The cabin 's overhead slopes up , going aft to the glass spray shield . Back from the spray shield , and covering the forward half of the long cockpit , is a wood canopy . The cockpit is stacked with new and replacement lobster traps . There are no exposed cleats aft of the cabin ; they are all set under the rail . All controls ? the wheel and winch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside a bronze cap over the rail . ( Maine lobsterboats group to the port side , and there may be a reason for their difference , but Massachusetts lobstermen say it is only because all Maine men are contrary- . ) We back up to the wharf . It is coming onto low tide and the wind is blowing off the black mud flats ; that and the dark smell of greasy uncovered pilings make the dimness and the wind colder . I am a little miffed to find that the Carolyn f. ' s lines making her fast to the pilings are plastic loose-braid ? colorful stuff you will find on beach toys . Carl is very much the sailor without pressing too much salty fare on you . and I expected manila lines . Later I ask him about the toy lines and he tells me manila and hemp last one season , while plastic or nylon will last five . The deck is eight feet below the dock , it is calm and the Carolyn rides easy . I pass the wire baskets and my own gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his lunch pail . He unlocks the cabin and fusses under the cockpit hatch with the engine while I stow the gear forward . The engine is a big diesel , and it shakes the boat all over . Carl shouts over the noise , " It has to be remounted on rubber blocks . Noisy . Remount in the winter . Four cycles . " It is , he later explains , much better for this work than a two-cycle diesel of the kind that powers buses . The four-cycle is more efficient , idling and revving alternately , a thing that Carolyn L 's motor will have to do for the next eleven hours , slowing for pots and moving quickly to the next buoy. 50 LETTER FROM CAPE COD eating them if someone sells them , but the Taylors wo n't . " The shorts are undersize lobsters . For every pound of lobster we take , Carl throws more than two pounds back . He is more careful of the shorts than of the crabs ; if a crab clings too tightly to the trap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobsters , big and small , fight his hand hard . While he pulls crabs out he must watch the lobsters carefully . The conches and starfish are like gay stones , they do not move . Carl rebaits the traps with two flounderbacks folded in half and pushed over the bent wire inside ? they pop when the backbones break . " I can remember when I was ten , I guess , big piles of starfish along the docks . The docks were more crowded then , more fishermen , and they would throw all the starfish they dredged or found in their pots on big piles . Later someone would take them to the dump and burn them . They 're predators on lobsters and clams and oysters . " I shout to Carl , is he going to move this string ? " No , " he says , they 'll be here next week . After a while you start to know where they 'll be . If they 're on this ledge they 'll be on three others too . That 's why an experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we start again . He watches the depth-sounder . There are two lights around its face , one at zero feet . one fairly steady at twenty-eight . The lower line breaks into smaller lines for an instant , and Carl pushes the pot overboard . " Rocks , " he shouts . " On the sounder . Wait . Some ahead of us . " We roar on for half a minute , and the sounder breaks into lines again . " See them ? " The rocks are where the lobster lives , rocks in cold water . He has thrown a depth-temperature instrument on a hand line all around the bay . It helped , he says , " but I knew most of what it told me . " We start off toward the next string , full throttle , trying to use the calm before the sun is high and hot enough to start the wind . Carl goes out every possible day except during the two stormiest months of winter . He is thrown overboard about twice every season . In the cold months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buoys . Now we are coming up on Bird Island , an unmanned lighthouse station off Marion . I can see several strings of pots all around the island ( little more than a rock ) . Carl says , " Now you 'll see some lobsters . " The first trap is full of them , snapping at the slats , at each other . Carl reaches in quickly and throws the shorts overboard . I can see them clawing at one another , sinking in pulses with their quick-squirting angry tails . He sets the two legal lobsters ? out of seven ? on the control console before the wheel . They back against the roaming strip , arching their hacks , tails high , claws raised . " Here , " Carl shouts above the engine . " You get them right at the knuckles , see ? " He reaches above and behind the claws and slips his whole hand up beside the carapace , taking the lobster at the joints just behind the claws . The claws are brought together , they can not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragged pincers . Last year the buyers began to suggest banding , slipping a white rubber band around the claws with a quick pliers device ? it seemed to them more sanitary than the hand-whittled pine pieces wedged behind the movable jaw . Someone should have protested the change , the Sierra Club perhaps , but in any case it allows me to help during the day . Banding is less sporting than poking an enraged lobster with two bits of wood like a seagoing banderillero . The first lobster Carl throws back for me is a big three-pounder . He usually lofts them into a pile on the port side , where they scuttle about behind baskets and under traps . Between strings he bands them . This one arches his back high and spreads his claws as he backs in between two traps . I prod him out with a stick and then get him ... he looks pretty formidable . Banded , the lobsters go into the barrel swirling with seawater . Lobsters breathe with their gills , in water and air . The water must constantly circulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in oxygen-depleted water than in the air , where they can live for some time kept cool and undisturbed . ' Coy does not have a circulating keeper yet and carries them nicely on a bed of ice in a large cooler ; the temperature slows down their life functions , keeping them alive . Before I throw them into the keeper , Carl checks them . with the gauge . He also checks under the tail where the female lobster cements her eggs . Any eggs , even a single egg , class her as an egger ? as illegal as a short . The male lobsters are distinguishable by a line of horns on spikes down the middle of the tail 's underside . The female has no horns and must be carefully inspected each time . Often she is an egger , often the gauge slips over the carapace or can be gently forced and they go back in . Carl says simply , " Last year I learned patience . " UT THIS STRING requires no 13patience . Around Bird Island we never pull a pot without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good , more than one to every pot . " We 're slaughtering them . " Carl says . If you are taking in the several pounds a trap that these three summer months must produce to balance the year 's receipts , you are " slaughtering them . " If you are a good lobster-man it will not be luck ; it will be a matter of skill . The lobsters we are pulling around Bird Island are big trap lobsters ? two pounds . up to three . Down at the lobster markets by the water are flats and troughs running with fresh seawater , graded in weights of lobsters from one-and-a-quarter ( chicken lobsters ) to three pounds . Another flat holds eight-. twelve-. or thirty-pound monsters , picked up by dredgers in their bottom-weighted nets , that go for large wealthy families and restaurant salads . ( I would not want to meet one without a baseball bat . ) The big ones ( too big for our traps ) have excellent meat at a lower price per pound . though some say the meat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and there is evidence that in deeper waters they can live as long as a man may . We finish the Bird Island strings and start across Buzzard 's Bay , seven miles to Cleveland Ledge Lighthouse . when a dredger steams across our bow . Carl shouts , " Worked dredgers This little guy is one of the nicest kids you 'd ever want to meet . He 's one of nine children plus a mother and a grandfather living in a two room shack in ar impoverished area of a small Alabama town . His family 's most urgent problem is hunger . There 's simply not enough for them to eat . Not just at certain times of the year .. but day in and day out . Malnutrition is endangering their present health as well as the development of their minds and bodies . Right ncw . Rignt here in the U.S.A. , there are thousands of families on the back roads of the rural South whose diets are so inadequate they are facing slow starvation . That 's why the NAACP Emergency Relief Fund is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stamps for families of tenant farmers , field hands and seasonal workers . Under this federally sponsored program , 50o buys as much as $12 worth of Food Stamps Since many families have almost no income at all , contributions are vital . Your $10 can buy $240 worth of food to help them survive . As one donor recently wrote ? " Where else can my modest donation do so much ! " To contribute , please send as little or as much as you can to the NAACP Emergency Relief Fund . Contributions are tax-deductible . Thank you . THERE ARE LOBSTERMEN who bring in a better catch than Carl 's . William Whipple is a commercial offshore lobsterer who fishes as far as two hundred miles out up to the edge of the continental shelf , from a $500.000 ship equipped with a temperature probe I , about $60,000 worth of very sensitive equipment ) with which he locates the precise temperature locales lobsters inhabit . None of his buoys show above the surface they are underwater radio beacons that surface by radio command from his ship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rig , he can expect around fifteen pounds of legal lobster . But the skills that Carl Taylor plies are his father 's ; they are old men 's skills learned many grandfathers back , taught to each son and nephew and godson , relearned . Carl knows where the lobsters are without a temperature probe , without having seen the bottom or the lobsters he hunts under the rocks his fathometer registers . He reads the water better than I read road signs . He is afraid of the waves and does not enjoy cold or pitching about any more than I do ; but he is a fisherman . it is a calling . E SLAUGHTER THEM . On the V way back across Buzzard 's Bay , I steer while Carl brushes the Carolyn J. down . When we have the Wareham channel markers alongside it is 5:00 P.M. , and we have taken lobsters enough to fill the barrel and three wire baskets . We hoist six bushelsful up onto the dock 1 it is low tide again ) and into the truck . At the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market owner looks down into the basement and asks Carl to weigh them himself , he is busy . Carl brings up the slip marked with the weights after he sorts them into the troughs . He talks with the market-man , they nod and laugh over the iced trays . Carl picks up bags of potato chips and we are in the truck again . But Carl 's day is not done yet ; he still has to make the New Bedford trip for bait and take a load of traps down to the dock . Then he will turn in early , because a lobsterman 's day starts at four .
