txt A controversy is raging over , an alleged autobiography ' of billionaire recluse Howard Hughes . Author Clifford Irving claims to have based the . biography on taped interviews with Hughes himself . Hughes , however , denies ever having met Irving and , in a rare telephone interview with a panel of newsmen , referred to the book as " a fairy tale . " Much has occurred since then to deepen the mystery . But a man reportedly residirj on the ninth floor at the Britannia Beach Hotel here is in a position to shed some light on the situation  --  Howard Hughes . Accordingly , I went to the hotel to seek an interview . The Door Opens A small television camera scans the approach to the door on the Britannia 's ninth floor . There are two peepholes in the door . A knock , a brief wait , then the door was opened a few inches by a rugged but harassed man in an open-neck sports shirt " I 'd like to see Mr. Howard Hughes , please . " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , " the man replied , becoming even more agitated . Behind him there seemed to be a sort of anteroom . " But ... " " Check at the desk , " the guardian cut in , closing the door . His voice still could be heard thru the heavy barrier . Evidently he was on the telephone or an intercom system . " Hotel security , " he was saying urgently . " Security , we 've got trouble in the corridor .. . " Striking Absence of Trouble In fact , the corridor was silent and anonymous as any other hotel corridor . All the doors were closed . One bore a " do not disturb " sign . Down by the elevator bank a maid was busy with her trolley of sheets and towels . " Did you make Mr. Hughes ' bed this morning ? " she was asked . She dissolved into giggles . There were more indications in the lobby of the billionaire 's presence on the top floor . All the mail boxes for the block of rooms occupied by the Hughes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occupant on the ninth floor . " He 's got two pool tables up there  --  he just loves playing pool , " said one bellboy . " Have you seen him ? " " Oh , sure , " the bellboy replied . " He invited me to a cocktail party just last Friday . There were six girls and four ; men . " Then , of course , he goes swimming in the hotel pool quite frequently . Nobody realizes who , he is . " " He loves to cat squash , " said another . " When 1 take hint his food I can see his electric chair . It 's like a dentist 's chair whieht you can adjust into any shape by touching a button . I have to leave his food on a tray . " Sometimes , as the furor over the Hughes biography lurches on , it 's possible to hear the billionaire laughing in his ninth floor suite . But that could be Imagination , too .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
