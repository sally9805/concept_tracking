txt Letters : Carillons That Truly Ring True pg . 339 Letters : Carillons That Truly Ring True To the Editor : In the article by Robert W. Toll on Stephen C. Foster , " South 's Foster Child " ( Travel Section , Oct. 3 ) , the writer has continued to propagate the misconception that there is a carillon in the Stephen Foster Center in White Springs , Fla. , along the Suwannee River . It Is time we call a spade a spade and not a heart or club . This carillon is not a true carillon at all . The fact is that it does not have any bells at all ? only tubes . A carillon , by definition , must have real , bronze bells and must have a minimum of two octaves of these bells . The average range of a carillon today is four octaves , and the largest and heaviest carillon today is the one in New York City in the tower of the Riverside Church . It has 74 bells , the heaviest weighing 20 tons . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? is working diligently to educate the public about our instrument . Imitations and frauds should be labeled as such , and not passed off as the real thing . WILLIAM DETURK Assistant Carillonneur , University of Michigan Ann Arbor Al Head , the director of the Stephen Foster Center , replies : It is true the carillon at the Stephen Foster Center , built by J. C. Deagan Company of Chicago in 1957 , may not technically be considered a true carillon although in layman 's terms it does not contradict the generalized definition in Webster 's Dictionary of a carillon , and it does have the tonal quality and resounding characteristics of a familiar cup-shaped cast hell . The unique tubular " bells " actually consist of three sets of 32 " bells " with a chromatic scale range from C to G , plus a fourth high-G bell . Three bells sound in perfect unison for each note to produce a strong resonant note response . The tubular bell definitely is a more efficient design for the production of musical tone . However , tubular bells do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape makes it possible to tune the fundamental note and the four predominant overtones . The five-point harmonic tuning considerably reduces the discordant minor third which causes the sour-note and out-of-tune effect listeners often hear when familiar melodies are played with harmony on cast-bell carillons . HUNTERS To the Editor : Perhaps Richard O'Mara 's emotional account of Ohio deer hunters and children 's distress , " A Family Campout A Hunter , A Deer " ( Travel Section , Oct. 24 ) requires an addendum . Personally , I could never bring myself to shoot a deer . But every year , on land I own in the Southern Tier , I allow my farmer-neghbors and a few other friends to take 12 or 15 deer . Why ? When I was a farm boy in that area some 60 years ago , there was n't a single deer to be found in Steuben County . However , they began to migrate from the Pennsylvania mountains in the mid-1920 's , being attracted by abandoned farmlands and unharvested orchards . Last year , in that one county , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many more were killed by cars or taken illegally . If there were no hunting , what would the situation be ? I can answer that in my own emotional way . I would be able to take Mr. O'Mara 's children into my woods and show them the rotting carcasses of countless deer , dead of starvation . And they could listen to the area 's farmers bemoaning the destruction of their corn and other silage crops . WALTER J. CONLEY Pittsford , N. Y. CUTTING COSTS AT SEA To the Editor : I found the article by Christopher Wren " Traveling through Scandinavia the Way the Scandinavians Do " ( Travel Section , Oct. 24 ) quite evocative . reminding me of many similar boat journeys in that part of the world . It was also instructive in that it suggests a way to slow down or even reverse the decline of passenger ship travel . As far as I know , none of those vessels includes the price of food in their passage . Rather , one pays only for transportation , and if desired , sleeping accommodations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants and orders as much or as little as one pleases , paying accordingly . This not only permits the passenger // Letters to the Travel Editor To the Editor . Having just read Virginia Miles 's article , " For the Woman on Her Own : Trust Pople  --  Within Limits " ( Travel Section , Oct. 31 ) , I say , " right on . " I have just returned from a threeweek tour of France , driving a car by myself with a knowledge of some German and a very few words of French . My friends at home asked , " Are n't you afraid to be driving by yourself with no knowledge of the language ? ' They almost made me think twice about going . The roads were great , even the small ones , the signs placed in strategic places which did not let one get lost , and even though I had to ask directions and could n't make out what was told me in torrents of French , I made it : No autoroutes for me . One does not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove from Luxembourg , having taken Iclandic Airlines and stopping off a day in Iceland , then on to Paris where I stayed five days with a relative . I then drove to Vezalay for a night , on to Perouges for another night , and then up and around mountains to Val D'Isere . Magnificent scenery . From ValD'Isere , I drove to Tailoirs on Lake Annecy for an overnight stay and then on to a four-day stay with another relative in a tiny village outside of Strasbourg , and then on to New York // all too well . When one has already paid handsomely for all meals ( four or five a day ) in advance , the temptation to overindulge is nearly irresistible . And to satisfy passenger expectations , to eat what , when , where and with whom he or she pleases it also cuts down on the incredible waste that most trans-Atlantic passengers know the chefs usually prepare much too much food . This leads to a shameful waste of food and to much higher fares on ships that follow this archaic practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship fares goes to meals , snacks , and such unnecessary services as the deck chair steward . If that is even close to the mark , their elimination could make ship travel much more competitive with air travel . And for those of us who worry about fuel waste and air pollution , the five days and slightly higher fare would easily be preferred to the rapid , but environmentally destructive jet plane voyage . J. DAVID SINGER Ann Arbor , Mich . To the Editor : The article by Christopher Wren , " Traveling Through Scandinavia the Way the Scandinavians Do " ( Travel Section , Oct. 24 ) , was quite in tune with my experiences aboard these cruise ships . Last summer I traveled economy class to Helsinki from CopenReproduced bagel% and the accommodations were very pleasant . In fact , because the ship never did " fill up , " I had , by default , a cabin to myself , but going from Helsinki to Stockholm was a different experience entirely . Needing to save a bit , I , too , had seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a " first-class airplane seat " would , not be bad at all . Unfortunately , the weather was rough that evening . I could not afford the t5 dinner and had the cafeteria version of Swiss steak and potatoes instead , a meal which I soon relinquished . The besotted young men on holiday in steerage were annoying everyone with their carousing ( at 4 in the morning ) as well as with their seasickness . I spent most of the night seeking the fulcrum of the ship and a chair in which to sit undisturbed . The point is , steerage is steerage , no matter what the accommodations seem to be . Perched on top of the ship , deck passengers get the brunt of any tossing the ship might do . We found some comfort in quiet conversation in a lounge far beneath the water level , but we refugees agreed that the cheap liquor and cigarettes were bad company during a stormy crossing . The fault was not in the ship itself , or its personnel . It was in poverty and the discomfort inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHRISTINE W. GAUZY Luxembourg and a plane back to New York . A woman alone can do it alone . I met people along the way whom I talked to in English , naturally , and enjoyed myself . The last time I drove around Europe by myself was in 1956 . I still can do . it at the age of 57 . So , ladies , take that trip alone . Stop being afraid . ELIZABETH MEYEa North Olmsted , Ohio To the Editor : Cheers to Virginia Miles for trusting people in her travels . I agree with her thesis completely . As a business woman who frequently travels alone for work and for pleasure , -I can testify firsthand to similar experiences . My introduction to West Berlin was a grand tour of the city by night . An Italian business executive from Milan , who knew the city well , appointed himself my tour guide . We met in a crowded cafe that I had stumbled upon on my first eve in the city . The waiter had seated me at his table since we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Coast I was assigned a seat next to a young woman from Bologna , Italy , who spoke very little English . My Italian is sketchy at best , but in five airborne hours we shared our family heritages , through a little Italian , a little English and a lot of gesturing . On my first stay in England I discovered the underworld of London discos with a newfound Israeli friend who introduced himself while I was lunching at a Chelsea restaurant . There are dozens of other " people adventures " I 've experienced through traveling  --  all of them made possible , as Mrs. Miles says , by exercising courage . JEAN L. FARINELLI New York To the Editor : On a trip to Hakate , Japan , money was short and I decided to get to the airport via local bus . Saying only the airport name and hearing " hi " from the bus driver , I boarded the bus . After 15 minutes the ticket collector showed me the center door and not seeing any signs of an airport , I resumed my seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was obviously the end of the route . The driver and conductor had a conference . We started back to the city and when we arrived at a busy cross . street , the conductor removed my suitcase from the bus . I followed and he flagged down a car containing four Japanese men . Another conference , and he bowed me into the car . I got in and soon found myself at the airport , several blocks from the bus stop . From this , I found a little giving on both sides really helps , and back home I always try and help our visitors who are struggling with subway or bus maps . Why not ? They appreciate it , and I know I do when I am traveling alone . MRS . A. D. HURLEY New York " NUISANCE CLAIMS " To the Editor : An article in the Notes Column discussed the Supreme Court ruling that allowed a class action in a case involving alleged losses suffered by travelers on tours ( Travel Section , Oct. 24 ) . I do not minimize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recourse for reimbursement for lost time and money due to real negligence . However , there are few travel agents or tour operators who have not been intinddated into settlements for strictly " nuisance . claims " of clients who threaten to gin ' to local consumer bureaus . It is cheap : er to give them $25 or $50 , even if ? unjustified , than to spend days plaining to consumer-oriented bureatc- , cratic offices that it was not due ny : the agent 's negligence that his ad read ' " Sunny Arizona , " and it rained two ; days . This may be a tongue-in-cheek example , but many claims are equally ludicrous . A malfunctioning air-conditioned bus , a room not ready for early arrival , an inferior meal , a toilet that did n't flush , an overbooked flight , an ill-tempered guide , late flights , etc. have all been causes for " I 'll Sue I 'll Sue I 'll Sue . " A strong comparison can be made with the financial disaster facing dm // WOMEN ALONE Further reproduction prohibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of malpractice lawsuits . The public is now paying the piper with unbelievable medical and hospital bills . The travel industry has a comparable " errors and omissions " liability insurance that many agents and tour operators carry . Like malpractice insurance rates , the cost of such insurance is , in proportion to tour prices , skyrocketing . NORMAN S. SHERMAN Travel Consultant Larehmont , N.Y . GROUP TOURS To the Editor . Group tours are not without their advantages . However , my husband and I , who have annually traveled to Spain for the past ten years , have steadfastly refused to join any tour group , such as the one described in Mary Louise Wilkinson 's article , " Toledo : A Day Trip Misses the Best of It " ( Travel Section , Sept. 26 ) . Why ? Consider our experiences this year in Granada . We set out to visit the Alhambra at the reasonably early hour of 9:30 . As we climbed the mountains through the forest-like gardens of the Alhambra , we delighted in the sound of the cool mountain water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the city in the valley below . But soon we could not help but notice ( the fumes were overpowering ) the number of enormous new tour buses also making their way up the mountain . After we had . paid our money , we entered the Mexuar Hall , which we had hoped would evoke the magical years of the Arab occupation of Spain . We hardly made it through the door . The room was filled with five or six tour groups , bunched around their multilingual guides who , in loud voices , proclaimed the wonders of the Alhambra . They pointed out the magnificent ceramic work on the walls , which nobody could see because hundreds of tourists blocked the view . Finally , we asked the guard at the entrance if there was such a thing as an " off " hour . He suggested lunchtime-2 to 4 P.M. We returned thee and found we had the palece to ourselves and that it was as splendid as we had imagined it to be . That night at 11:45 , after a late Spanish dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the palace so enchanting on our afternoon visit that we wanted to zee it once more and to feel its mystery in the dim flight of evening . To our surprise , the palace was open until midnight . The dozing guards did not want to let us in at this late hour , but we persuaded them and rushed to the Arrayanes Courtyard to see our favorite spot before the nighttime illuminations were put out . Our voices dropped , our steps slowed ; we were awestruck by the sight before us . Four people were sitting on the stone floor in utter silence , gazing upon the green waters of the courtyard 's pond which was reflecting the delicately carved columns of the palace in its still waters . Everyone was lost in his own reveries , and we immediately succumbed to the mood . It was a religious  --  almost mystical ? experience . So lost were we in our thoughts , that we failed to notice that the other visitors had disappeared . At precisely 12 midnight , all the lights went out and the Alhambra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took tentative steps in the direction of the exit . Now I could vividly imagine Washington Irving 's terror when he awoke during his first night alone in the palace . After what seemed an eternity , a guard approached with a flashlight and led us out . Toledo and Granada are two of the most important stops for any visitor to Spain , and it is foolish to avoid them simply because of the crowds . The point is to individualize your travel experiences by taking the added time to plan your trip and read up on the places you are to visit . I keep thinking of those groups making their way through the tourist-lined rooms of the Alhambra , missing the very essence of the Alhambra , which I believe we experienced . PENELOPE CASAS Whitestone , N.Y . BOSTON To the Editor : The article by Jay Walz , " What 's Doing in Boston " ( Travel Section , Oct. 17 ) , was most useful , but it just is n't true that " there is usually not too long a wait " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as three hours . By the time you 're served , you do n't care much about the quality of the food . JOYCE S. ROCHMORE Needham , Mass . VILLAGE FOR SALE To the Editor : The article about the medieval French village of Cauvel ( Travel Notes , Oct. 31 ) , which my father is offering for sale contained a typographical error . The price is $115,000 not $15,000 . ISABELLE COLLIN DUFRESN1 New York
