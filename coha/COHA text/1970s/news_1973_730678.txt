txt THIS COUNTRY is using more fuel  --  oil , natural gas , and coal  --  than it can produce . Result : The energy crisis . For millions of Americans , the energy crisis became real daring the winter of 1972-73 . After decades of cheap and plentiful fuel that nourished this nation 's herculean growth , the United States suddenly could not find enough fuel to heat its homes and power its factories and transportation . " The joyride is over , " says S. David Freeman , one-time energy adviser to Presidents Johnson and Nixon . The richest nation in the world is becoming energy poor because , among other things , it has burned most of the oil and natural gas that have been easy to find in America . " THE ERA OF low cost , clean energy sources is almost dead , " says former Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson . " Popeye is running out of cheap spinach . " Experts say the energy situation is going to get worse in the next 10 to 15 . years and they warn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next 10 to 15 years to find our way out of this mess , before things really get bad . Despite all of our glib talk of the " space age " and " space . age technology , " this generation of Amerjf ins feasts on Two Tribune specialists , Ronald ' Wallah , science editor , and Casey Bukro , environment editor , probed the meaning of the energy crisis . This is the second of a series . the bounties of Mother Earth like no generation before it . OIL , NATURAL gas , and coal that are pumped or dug The energy crisis from the earth account for 91 per cent of our power . They energize our stoves , air condi boners , electric blankets and toothbrushes. home furnaces , dislaw.ishers. television sets , lawn mowers , and the 100 million autos that clog our highways . With less than 6 per cent of the world 's population , the U. S. guzzled one-third of the globe 's energy production in 1971 Energy consumption is growing at a rate of 5 per cent a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. population . American energy demands are expected to double by 1985 , and swell five-fold by the year 2000 . SOME EXPERTS are alarmed because energy consumption in this country is doubling and redoubling in shorter periods of time . Between now and the year 2000 , for example , the U. S. will consume more energy than it has in its entire history . " I think our energy shortage is not only endemic , it 's incurable , " said a member of the Federal Power Commission . " We 're going to live with it the rest of our lives . " The pessimism is understandable . Even a glance at the energy picture in this country shows an incredibly tangled and interwoven web . Touch one part of it and all the other parts quiver . THE STORY of coal in the last 30 years is a good example . Since 1945 , coal 's share of the nation 's energy source has fallen sharply to 18 per cent , while natural gas and petroleum have shot upward . Railroads began converting to diesel engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , the price of natural gas was kept low , so this fuel invaded major coal markets for beating and industry . ' In the mid- ' 60s , coal suffered another serious setback when electric utilities began ordering nuclear reactors instead of coal-burning boilers . In ' 1969. the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act set mine safety , standards that added as much as ill ' a ton M the cost of deep rains cola : ? THEN THE CLEAN Air Act of 1970 set air pollution standards that outlawed much of the use of high-sulfur coal . In the last two years , 850 underground coal mines have closed down . The governmental action was taken because coal takes such a heavy toll on human health and safety . It blackens the lungs of miners with coal dust and kills them in mine . accidents . When burned in boilers and furnaces , it fills the air with dust and gases that damage the lungs . Researchers are seeking ways to burn coal without environmental and health risks . AND SO , In the midst of plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of fueL The coal industry , like the oil and gas industries , is quick to blame environmental control for all of its troubles . But it is much more complex than that , involving economics , governmental controls , long-time business trends , competition , and environment . Here Ls what the United States fuel supply looks like : ? Oil  --  Petroleum , the ' world 's key energy source , filled 44 per cent of the nation 's energy needs in 1972 . Of the 2.9 trillion barrels of oil in U. S. soil , only 52 billion barrels have been located and can be pumped out . That is less than a 10-year supply at the rate we use it . A lot of oil hi the earth is unreachable with current technology . ? Natural gas  --  The fastest growing fuel in the- U. S. over the last 20 years , natural gas supplied 33 per cent of the nation 's energy needs in 1972 . Known and recoverable gas reserves in the nation - mounted to 290 trillion cubic feet ? enough to last another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states last year . Forty-three per cent of industry and 150 million Americans rely on gas for power , heating , and cooling . ? Coal  --  Our most plentiful source of fuel , coal accounted for only 18 per cent of the nation 's energy budget last year . Nearly 3.2 trillion tons of coal are believed to exist in the U. S. Up to 390 billion tons of that can be mined . That could last 300 to 800 years , depending on how much we use or export . If this nation turns heavily to coal when technology is perfected to burn coal cleanly or to convert it into liquid or gas fuels , the coal supply in this country might last about 100 years . ? Uranium  --  Nuclear fission accounts for less than 1 per cent of the energy in the nation today , but it is expected to rise to 13 per cent by 1985 . Nuclear electric power generating plants use uranium to keep the atomic fires burning . Known uranium reserves amount to 273,000 tons , or enough to last another nine years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to something like 1.6 million tons  --  enough to last until the year 2000 . ? Water  --  Hydroelectric power put 4 per cent of the electric in the nation 's energy basket last year . By 1985 , water power probably will account for less than 3 per cent , of the total energy picture because there are not many places in the country where hydroelectric plants can be built . But that still might be enough to aggravate the rising furor over water quality and water quantity . As the population grows , so does water use . Some calculations indicate that the U. S. will have a water deficit of 30 per cent by the year 2020 . ? Electricity  --  Electricity is Considered " secondary " energy because power generating stations burn coal , gas , oil , or n , " lear energy to make electricity . Power generation is one of the largest energy consumers in the nation , accounting for 25 per cent of the total . That will rise to 36 per cent by 1985 . Electric power production in the U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .
