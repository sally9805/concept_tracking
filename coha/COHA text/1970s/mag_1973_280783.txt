That annual rite of fall in Manhattan - the convening of the U.N . General Assembly - got off to a celebrity-studded start last week . The undisputed star of the show was Henry Kissinger . <P> In his first week as Secretary of State , he seemed determined to touch bases with as many of the 135 member nations as possible . When he led off the week with an address before the General Assembly , the mood was one of almost tangible excitement . Ushers noted with surprise that all copies of the text had been snatched up beforehand . <P> " The anguish , the turmoil and the promise of the real world have frequently been obscured by rhetoric and distorted by slogans , " Kissinger declared . <P> " Beyond the bilateral diplomacy , the pragmatic agreements and dramatic steps of recent years , we envisage a comprehensive , institutionalized peace - a peace which this organization is uniquely situated to foster and to anchor in the hearts of men . " <P> It was an auspicious beginning , but on the whole his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ignite his hopeful audience . In addition to his broad statement of principles , Kissinger made two specific proposals : 1 ) that the Security Council establish more effective peace-keeping guidelines so that the U.N . <P> can play a useful role in future crises , and 2 ) that a world food conference be convened in 1974 to discuss ways of stockpiling adequate supplies to deal with natural disasters . Both proposals won praise . <P> Kissinger seemed more in his element in an intensive round of private meetings . Most effective was his luncheon for 15 Arab envoys . It was a clear sign that he intends to give the Middle East top priority . Denying a report from London that he had already worked out a plan for peace , Kissinger told the envoys that the U.S. was ready to assist in a settlement but that they should not expect any " miracles . " <P> With European diplomats , Kissinger sought to leave the impression that President Nixon 's trip is still a possibility this year . No dates were mentioned , however , and Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the constitutional crisis over the Watergate tapes and the plight of Vice President Agnew will force Nixon to postpone his visit until 1974 . Kissinger looked over a draft proposal outlining long-range Common Market goals and priorities and politely suggested that the nine nations try for something more specific than vague generalities . Both the U.S. and the members of the European Economic Community would like to have a formal agreement to sign , if and when Nixon goes to Europe . <P> Kissinger gave a dinner for Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in his Waldorf Towers suite and told him of congressional and public concern over Soviet treatment of dissident intellectuals . In a press conference before returning to Washington , Kissinger again criticized congressional attempts to link " most favored nation " status , which would give the Russians trade concessions , to Soviet emigration restrictions . If M.F.N. is blocked , he warned , other countries would doubt whether they " can rely on U.S. performance . " Besides , he suggested , no matter how the U.S. feels about the " human values at stake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others .
