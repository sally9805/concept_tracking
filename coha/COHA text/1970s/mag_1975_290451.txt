Plagued by staff resignations and soaring costs , New York 's Metropolitan Museum of Art might not have seemed in the best shape for heavy buying . But last week it announced a spectacular plunge . For $5.1 million the Met purchased the Harry Packard collection of Japanese art . In all , there are 412 objects , ranging from neolithic pots , clay Haniwa figures and 11th century Heian bronzes to screens and scrolls by some of the most revered figures in Japanese painting-Korin , Sotatsu , Mitsunobu . The amount was not quite the $5.5 million the museum paid in 1971 for Velsquez 's portrait of Juan de Pareja , but it was its largest and costliest single collection ever purchased en bloc . In fact , before the ink had dried on the check , concern was rising over the fact that the purchase had massively depleted the Met 's acquisition budget for the next five years . <P> The Packard collection was valued by Japanese art experts at $11.3 million . The difference , $6.2 million , was in effect Packard 's tax-deductible gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few great historical collections of Japanese art in private hands , " says the Los Angeles County Museum 's curator of Oriental art , George Kuwayama , " and the Metropolitan has scored a tremendous coup . " Kuwayama 's sentiment is particularly sporting , since the Packard collection had been under offer to Los Angeles since 1965 as a gift ( if the museum made it the nucleus of a Japanese study center , which it lacked the funds to do ) and half of it had been in storage there since 1966 . It is surmised that the Japanese government granted the export permits for the other half because of the diplomatic advantages of having a major Japanese collection in the Metropolitan . The advantage to the museum is that in one grand scoop it has enhanced a section of its permanent collection that for decades had been seriously neglected . But the most intriguing aspect of the deal was Packard , a somewhat mysterious U.S. citizen who has lived in Japan since 1946 . Until the Met bought his collection he was not rich .

But nobody in the tight world of Japanese art studies doubts the scholarship or acquisitive acumen of the man who is described as looking like a cross between Peter Lorre and the Buddha . Packard has traveled all over Japan in quest of objects for his collection-or for sale to U.S. buyers-and he knows every cranny of a society still opaque to most Americans . " He 's the most relentless collector I 've ever met , " marvels one New York orientalist . " He 's totally committed . There 's nothing he wo n't do to get a piece he wants . He 'll mortgage his house to raise the money for a 13th century carving and tell his family to get ready to move out . "
