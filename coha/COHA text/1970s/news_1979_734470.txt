txt LOS ANGELES  --  In 1983 a mobster named Joseph Valachi appeared before the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and told of a complex national crime syndicate that he said had infiltrated every aspect of American life . The " syndicate , " as he called it , was Involved in labor unions , murder , extortion , drug trafficking , official corruption , prostitution , gambling , and a multitude of so-called white-collar crimes . Money earned from the syndicate 's huge network of illicit activities was " laundered " in legitimate all-American businesses such a car washes , restaurants , and bowling alleys , Valachi testified . Outraged and shocked senators armed with Valachi 's invaluable testimony promised swift action . Organized crime in America w o uld be crushed once and for all . It was only a matter of time before every " godfather " ill the nation would be behind bars . TODAY , 16 YEARS after Valachi 's historic testimony , organized crime is still with us  --  and it , is stronger , more pervasive , and less understood than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , investigators , and social scientists who recently participated in a unique National Conference on Organized Crime sponsored here by the University of Southern California . Not since the congressional investigations and hearings of the , late 1950s and early 19600 , which were headed by Sen. John L. McClellan ID. , Ark. and Atty . Gen. Robert F. Kennedy , had so many experts in organized crime gathered under one roof . When ' the two-day conference was over , one thing everybody agreed on was a need to develop a national strategy to fight organised crime . BUT BEFORE that can be done , ? authorities  --  and ' the public need a much clearer picture of what q ) rganized crime // qwq " Most of , what oUr citizens know about organized crime is learned from piecemeal reports in the news media or from movies such as ' Tbe Godfather , ' " said Sen. Sam Nunn ID. , Ga. , chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations . " Indeed , if you were to ask an average American to identify an organized crime figure today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nunn , who added that he planned to ? give organized // crime the highest priority in his subcommittee . Another senator went even further . Sen. Dennis DeConcini ED. , Ariz. ) said he would ask for creation of a new Select Committee on Organized Crime , and if that fails , he will go to the President and ask that a federal czar be apointed to coordinate the fight against organized crime . " The No. 1 enemy of this country is not the Soviet Union  --  it is organized crime , " DeConcini said . " As a business , the Mafia yields conservatively 10 times the profits of Exxon , the nation 's largest Corporation . Each has yearly sales of about $50 billion  --  although the actual tfigure for organized crime may be closer to $100 ' billion  --  Exxon had after-tax profits of $2.6 billion ; the Mafia had untaxed profits of about $25 billion . " NEVERTHELESS , WHILE panelists and crime experts ladened with briefcases spilling over with notes filled Southern California 's warm autumn air , with names , dates , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's No. enemy . Most quarreled with the stereotyped interpretations of organized crime as presented by Hollywood and pointed to ? U.S. Department of Justice figures which reveal that unlike the hoodlums of the Al Capone era , today 's syndicate owns approximately 10,000 legitimate businesses that generate annual profits in excess of $12 billion . " In some quarters , ' Organized Crime ' Is synonymous with the Mafia or La Cosa Nostra , " said Philip R. Manuel , senior staff investigator for Nunn 's subcommittee . " Now to be sure , criminals of Sicilian and Italian descent are an important part of what we call organized crime , but organized crime is much more complicated than the entity called fir Mafia . Organized crime knows no ethnic bounds . " The organized crime apparatus is composed of career criminals of various ethnic origin and criminal specialities whose common band is the attainment of wealth , power , and influence . ANOTHER MISCONCEPTION prevalent among Americans is that organized crime hurts only those who have dealings with it . Nothing could be further from the truth , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission . " It is believed that if you stay away from ' those kinds of people , ' they will leave you alone , " Schiller said . " The euphemistic ' they ' will not bother any but those , who with larceny in their own needs , seek to do business with them . " However , he added , the nation 's crime syndicates are partly responsible for a multitude of national ills , including urban blight , rising insurance rates , and even inflation . FOR EXAMPLE , Schiller said , in Chlcago and Milwaukee organized crime has been quick to Contribute to urban Column 1 decay by purchasing rental properties in the ghetto . " Through a series of controlled transactions , the purchase price Is inflated and the properties are mortgaged to their limits , " he explained . " For as long as possible , rents are drained off with little being reinvested in the building . As the building deteriorates and occupancy goes down , arson is likely with the Insurance being at least adequate to pay off the mortgage , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property and the inflated value , plus the property 's gross rental income . " BUT PRIVATE businessmen and an apathetic public are not the only ones to blame , said Michael Aguirre , a former assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego who organized the conference . " There is no nationwide strategy to cope with the problem of organized crime . " he said . " The federal government has not instituted a major crackdown on organized crime since the Kefauver Senate probe in 1950-51 and the labor rackets hearings In the mid 1950s . " Years of misdirection , ledifference , and inaction have resulted In our having an unacceptably incomplete picture of organized crime In America , " said Aguirre . Law enforcement officials complained that on Me one hand , they are restricted in gathering incriminating evidence on criminals , yet on the other , they must give out information about their past investigations under the Federal Free ? dom of Information Act , thereby intimidating investigators and endangering informants . BUT THERE has been , an even more important development , said Pulitzer Prize-winning historian kthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 500 high-powered lawyers and public relations techniques , actually has managed to achieve a certain respectability in our society . " I would not deprecate the power of organized crime , " Schlesinger said . " But I do n't think a sense of that power requires the belief that organized crime is controlled by a single nationwide monopoly of brothers joined together in mystic fraternity rites . " The myth of the Mafia , combined with a steady stream of Hollywood films which tended to glorify the mystique ? culminating in " The Godfather , " have served to turn the dons of organized crime into earth-bound dieties . " If there were any question that Hollywooe 's image of the Mafia has taken hold , it was quickly dispelled when two USC students carrying black violin cases stumbled Into the school 's Norris Theater by mistake . " You better not Come in HERE with THOSE , " a Nevada investigator joked as the two students retreated sheepishly.                    @
