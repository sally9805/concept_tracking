As part of TIME 'S ' 72 election-year coverage , Senior Correspondent John Steele will assess the performance of professional pollsters from time to time . The New Hampshire primary was their first test . Steele 's report : <P> EVEN expert pollsters shudder when they contemplate primary elections . The voting base is small , the electorate volatile , the reins of party discipline lax-and in 1972 the Democratic candidates many . Pollster Louis Harris , who is not gauging primaries this year , points out that polling must continue virtually up to election eve to spot possible switches in voter sentiment that can run as high as 20% in the week before voting day . Given all the hazards , the polling in New Hampshire measured up reasonably well against the actual results . <P> <P> The most thorough polls were taken for the Boston Globe by Becker Research Corp . of Boston , using sophisticated but by no means risk-free telephone polling . Becker 's first poll in January showed Edmund Muskie receiving 65% of the Democratic vote , a figure that soon became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp that their candidate was running against a phantom , i.e. , the numbers . <P> What was to have been the final poll was taken in late February and showed a drastic change . There had been a massive erosion of Muskie strength to 49% , and a major growth in George McGovern strength of 13 points to 31% . Even as Becker 's pollsters made their second round of 435 sampling calls , Muskie was mounting a flatbed truck in the campaign 's single dramatic moment to denounce , in tears , Manchester Publisher William Loeb . Another " final " poll was ordered by the Globe ; it showed Muskie strength off still more to 42% , McGovern at 26% , and the number of undecideds inexplicably doubled to 20% . <P> Actually , the second final poll was rushed to meet a deadline , and depth questions were not included . The first final , as a result , came closer to the actual outcome . It was only one point off Muskie 's 48% vote total , off six on McGovern 's 37% , two points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Yorty and Vance Hartke . <P> Two other polls , meanwhile , had not done as well . The Public Television Service in New Hampshire took an early February sample that showed Muskie receiving 58% of the vote and McGovern 19% ; it was never updated . Pat Caddell , the 22-year-old president of Cambridge Survey Research , in private polls for McGovern , gave Muskie 46% and McGovern 30% . Caddell did , however , advise correctly that McGovern could do well in blue-collar and middle-income areas by taking specific though not necessarily popular stands on issues . Overall , the polling in the nation 's first primary was fairly accurate .
