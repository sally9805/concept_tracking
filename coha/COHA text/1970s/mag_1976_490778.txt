THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ALITTLE over a year ago , the Senate and the House of Representatives each set up a Select Committee on Intelligence to examine and report on the various secret operations conducted by the executive branch against America 's enemies at home and abroad . The bask issue involved in both investigations has been the same as the basic issue involved in Watergate  --  whether the government has placed itself above its own laws . In some ways , though , the problem presented by the activities of the intelligence " community " is greater , and perhaps even more threatening to the Republic , than the problem uncovered in the Watergate affair . For one thing , press reports and congressional revelations suggest that the illegal acts committed by intelligence officials under several Administrations may have been far graver and more numerous than those committed by President Nixon and his associates . For another , it is extremely difficult to do anything about intelligence officials ' crimes , because the intelligence apparatus is not merely a bureaucracy whose members , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a bureaucracy that is dedicated to absolute secrecy . The most effective way to break through to its hidden truths , in order to reform and control it , would he to force some of its members to talk under threat of prosecution if they did n't , as was done with government officials in the Watergate case . But the one government department with the authority to do this , the Department of justice , has expressed no intention  --  publicly , at least  --  of prosecuting anyone , even though the various agencies involved have admitted the commission of many thousands of crimes over the past twenty years or so . About the best suggestion that Attorney General Edward Levi could come up with during his testimony before Congress on crimes committed by agents and high officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , for instance , was that a law be passed making such illegal acts legal in the future . Another problem in dealing with the intelligence issue is that it is nearly impossible to expose and punish appointed government officials unless their elected superiors want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford has done his utmost to protect them . ( In Watergate , of course , the same kind of dilemma was resolved by the appointment of the Special Prosecutor , whose independence from the executive branch was assured by the public fury that the so-called Saturday Night Massacre generated . ) And , finally , little is usually done about official misdeeds until a large number of indignant and persistent citizens demand that something be done . When the public learned that President Nixon had broken the law in significant ways , he was driven from office . But the same public has shown little interest in lawbreaking by members of such agencies as the F.B.I . and the Central Intelligence Agency . In fact , the bulk of the mail from voters to the two Select Committees has been " hate mail , " accusing their members of treasonous conduct . This disparity in the public response to the two cases may seem curious , since Nixon and the intelligence officials relied on the same excuse : national security . On the one hand , however , the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose was clearly both per sonal and pernicious . On the other hand , the public has accepted the intelligence community 's justification -- as it has been stated again and again by President Ford  --  because the public believes that the purpose of that community is to protect the nation 's security by fighting Communism wherever and however it appears . In all likelihood , that has been the true purpose , and to almost all Americans it would seem to he a valid one . In effect , the public 's reaction to stories about the mayhem and murder authorized by high intelligence officials to carry out this purpose has been to say , " Do what you must do to protect us , but do n't tell us about it . " This attitude has persisted despite documented accounts of certain agencies ' repeated failures to protect us  --  for example , the C.I.A . ' s failure to give sufficient advance warning of forthcoming events like the Tct offensive , the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia , the 1973 Middle East war , the test of a nuclear bomb by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portugal . Nor has there been a much stronger public response to other shocking revelations , including the cost of our overall intelligence effort , which comes to some ten billion dollars a year rather than three billion dollars a year , as the agencies have claimed ; the agencies ' frequent attempts to shore up repressive and sometimes murderous regimes abroad , and to destroy by illegal means legal and democratic political movements at home ; and , above all , the intelligence community 's implicit endorsement of the philosophical basis for totalitarianism  --  that the end justifies the means . Thanks to the lack of public pressure on the Administration to reveal what its intelligence people have been doing , it was able to resist , and often thwart , congressional attempts to dig out the truth . But even the scraps of the story that congressional invesrigators succeeded in piecing together alarmed the Administration , and , drawing on its immense power , it set out to keep that story from the public . Late in January , when the House Select Committee prepared its report , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure from the White House , the C.I.A. , and the State Department has been astounding , " one House member said at the time . " I 've never seen anything like it . " Administration lobbyists repeatedly invoked the name of Richard Welch , the head of the C.I.A . station in Athens , who was murdered there last December . They charged that members of Congress who had earlier revealed C.I.A . secrets were responsible for his murder , and that members of the House who voted to make the report public would be responsible for similar murders in the future . The implication of such charges was clear : members who voted to release the report would be vulnerable at election time this fall to accusations that they had jeopardized the nation 's security . Since the members of the Select Committee , who are presumably as patriotic as the members of the Administration , voted by better than two to one to release the report , it seemed unlikely that it contained anything significant that had not already been reported by the press . ( Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early draft of it , in the Village Voice not long afterward revealed little that was n't already known . ) Still , an official , and complete , report would carry far greater weight than sporadic accounts in the press , and its impact on the public might finally be great enough to jeopardize the C.I.A . ' s present policies and the job security of those who devise them and carry them out . But once it was clear that there was little in the way of public support for disclosing the seamier side of intelligence operations , a majority of the House members were unwilling to go along with the committee , and they performed some bewildering gyrations to extricate themselves from their political dilemma . Before the House voted on whether or not the report should he released , the Rules Committee sent to the floor a fuzzily worded resolution that seemed designed to suppress the report . Some members apparently voted for the resolution in the belief that it would keep the report from the public ; other members apparently voted for it in the belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public but from members of Congress , so they would n't have to face the issues it presented ; and still other members apparently were n't sure what they were voting on . In the end , the vote was nearly two to one in favor of the resolution , whatever it meant . Confusion was so rampant afterward that the resolution finally had to be interpreted by the House Parliamentarian , who ruled that it left the decision on what was to be done with the report up to the Speaker , or up to the House itself if it chose to vote on the question again . Until one or the other acted , all copies of the report were to be locked up and guarded by the Clerk of the House . That was where the matter stood last week , when the President held a televised press conference at which he announced " plans for the first major reorganization of the intelligence community since 1947 . " The plans turned out to be a bureaucratic reshuffling of the community , which seemed designed to increase its power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of it by concentrating final authority over its policies and activities not in the public 's elected representatives in Congress but in the Office of the President . When a reporter observed at the press conference that " we know that Office has abused the C.I.A . in the past " and asked what would he done to control such abuses in the future , Mr. Ford replied , " It should n't happen , and I would hope that the American people will elect a President who will not abuse that responsibility . I certainly do n't intend to . " Poor Richard Nixon  --  out of office less than two years and forgotten already . President Ford said that he was going to issue " a comprehensive set of public guidelines " to " provide stringent protections for the rights of American citizens , " and that he would recommend to Congress certain laws against " electronic surveillance and mail openings , " together with " legislation that would prohibit attempts on the lives of foreign leaders in peacetime . " ( The following day , the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including an executive order , which lacks the force of law , to limit or prohibit these activities . But his proposals said nothing about enforcing existing laws on such matters by prosecuting those who have already broken them . ) In praising " the dedicated men and women who gather vital information around the world and carry out missions that advance our interests in the world , " he implied endorsement of the continuing use of such missions , which presumably include the " covert operations , " such as the overthrow of the Allende government in Chile , that he has long defended . Most important of all , though , he said that he was sending to Congress legislation that " would make it a crime for a government employee who has access to certain highly classified information to reveal that information improperly . " When another reporter asked if this proposal amounted to an Official Secrets Act , like the one in Great Britain , which makes the disclosure of state secrets a crime , the President retorted , " I categorically disagree with your assessment It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that prevails in Great Britain . " The difference is well hidden , for the British act prohibits any unauthorized disclosure of official information by any Crown servant . If such a law had existed in this country in the past few years , the Pentagon Papers would not have been published , the Watergate affair would have remained a secret , and we would know nothing about official malfeasance on the part of the intelligence community . The only purpose of such a law would be to render cover-ups of official malfeasance unnecessary in the future . Essentially , the President seemed far mare interested in making the act of telling the truth a crime than in punishing those who have committed crimes and have continued to conceal the truth about them . In short , he was more concerned about leaks than about crimes . To defend secrecy in foreign-intelligence gathering , Mr. Ford emphasized his responsibility for the conduct of foreign policy  --  a Constitutional power delegated to the President . But he did n't mention two Constitutional references to his other responsibilities  --  to " preserve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care that the laws he faithfully executed . " Perhaps the most puzzling aspect of the President 's announcement was his making it at all . Since the public was n't interested in the problems he discussed  --  or , rather , in the issues he avoided  --  any reference to them appeared politically unwise , for he thereby created concern where little had existed before . Yet one of his purposes may have been political ; that is , he may have been trying once more to placate the right wing by defending and strengthening one of its most cherished institutions . To accomplish that fully , the President may also have been trying to make it appear that his proposals solved the intelligence problem altogether ; by this means , he might head " Hey ! why do n't we just say we have ninety-one per cent full employment ? " ? ? off any future release of the House Select Committee 's report , as well as reduce the impact of , and maybe even establish a precedent for suppressing , the Senate Select Committee 's report on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released in mid-March and is expected to he far more comprehensive , fully documented , and alarming than its House counterpart . Since the Senate investigation of this nation 's intelligence operations is the most exhaustive ever conducted , it seems odd that Mr. Ford did n't choose to wait until it was published , in order to use its information as the basis for his proposals for reform and control  --  unless , of course , he feared that the Senate report might create , at last , the kind of public demand for true reform and control which would be politically , irresistible . ? ? Items EVERY evening between six and seven o'clock , the Greater New York desk of United Press International moves the Daybook . " Moves " is wire-service jargon for putting something out over the Teletypes ; the Day-hook is a list of events scheduled for the next day which are thought , for one reason or another , to be newsworthy . The Greater New York wire has sixty-odd subscribers . Assignment editors in radio and television newsrooms and on newspaper city desks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never-ending search for something for their reporters to do . The Daybook is to news what jute is to burlap  --  raw material for a manufactured product that itself is none too refined . To find out more about the Daybook , we dropped by the U.P.I. newsroom , which is in the Daily News Building . Because of the V.D.T.s hulking large next to most of the desks , the place looked like a hybrid of Mission Control at Houston and Hildy Johnson 's city room at the Chicago lictaldExaminer . A V.D.T. , or Video Display Terminal , is a machine that combines a television screen with a typewriter keyboard and is connected to what Dr. Strangelove might call a " gigantic network of computers ; " words are typed onto the screen , and then edited on the screen , before finding their way to paper . The V.D.T.s at U.P.I. have been in place for four years , and we were relieved to see that they are as abundantly covered with coffee stains , cigarette burns , and grubby fingerprints as the typewriters they arc meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the city editor , summoned up the current Daybook from the computer 's memory hank . A little green rectangle raced back and forth across the dark V.D.T. screen , leaving a trail of green lettering . The first item in the Daybook that evening was : SENIOR SUMMIT CONFERENCE IS HELD . NEW YORK SOCIETY FOR ETHICAL CULTURE , 2 W. 64TH ST 9 A.M. TO 3:30 P.M. The little green rectangle skywrote twenty-three more items , ending with : FORMER CALIFORNIA GOV . RONALD W. REAGAN , CANDIDATE FOR REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION . IS GUEST OF HONOR , KINGS COUNTY REPUBLICANS ' LINCOLN DAY DINNER , SHALIMAR . 2380 HYLAN BLVD. , STATEN ISLAND , 8 P.M. Bruce riffled the papers on his desk and came up with an ink-on-paper version of the Daybook . He went over each item , telling us the source . Two items the funerals of two firemen killed in a conflagration in Queens  --  had come from U.P.I. 's City Hall reporter . All the rest had come from press releases : press releases via mail , telephone , telex , Mailgram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reagan dinner , were fully legitimate 24 MARCH I 1 9 7 ( 2 news , in the sense that they were interesting and that they would take place whether or not anyone covered them . Others would take place regardless of coverage but were not interesting , such as a regularly scheduled meeting of the Tri-State Regional Planning Commission . Still others were possible feature items , such as a " new member coffee hour " being thrown by the Brooklyn branch of the National Organization of Women . Most of the Daybook items , though , described events that had no raison d't'Are other than to he covered : GOVERNOR CAREY ISSUES STATEMENT BACKING WORLD CONFERENCE ON SOVIET JEWRY MEETING NEXT WEEK IN BRUSSELS , 1350 SIXTH AVE. , 10:30 A.M. TOUR IS GIVEN FOR REPORTERS OF $3.5-MILLION PENTHOUSE OF STEW-ART MOTT , PHILANTHROPIST AND HEIR OF GENERAL MOTORS FORTUNE , GALLERIA , 117 E. 57TH ST. , 10:30 AM . MOSES KOVE , CHAIRMAN OF TAXI AND LIMOUSINE COMMISSION , HOLDS NEWS CONFERENCE TO REPORT ON USE OF SUCH EXPERIMENTAL TAXICABS AS MERCEDES-BENZ , PEUGEOT AND OTHERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When it 's a borderline case , we stick it in the Daybook , " Bruce told us . " If Mayor Beame is going to play hop scotch down at City Hall , say , it 's not very important , but it 's the kind of thing that might make a nice picture story or film-crew story , so in it goes . " Bruce showed us a heat-up file folder with slots numbered from 1 to 31 , for the days of the month , and slots hearing the names of future months . " The stuff goes in here as we get it , " he said . " Then , each afternoon , whoever happens to be free goes through it , sorts out the usable stuff , and types the thing up on the V.D.T. And , of course , we keep updating it throughout the next day with new advisories . " Fred Ferguson , U.P.1. ' s New York-New Jersey editor , joined us , and we asked him how many Daybook items he usually secs on the local television news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A lot . In fact , one of our press clients tells me that he takes the Daybook home with him and he and his wife sit there and het which Daybook item will turn up first on the eleven-o'clock news . " We took a copy of the Daybook home with us and watched the early-evening television news . We had to keep switching channels , and so may have missed something , but we did see film reports on five Daybook items : the funerals , the **30;5224;TOOLONG penthouse tour , the taxi news conference , a news conference by the American Cancer Society on cigarette smoking among young women , and a campaign appearance by Senator Birch Bayh . The next morning , the Times and the News , between them , covered ten Daybook items . ( Of course , it is always possible that the TV and press stories came from sources other than the Daybook . ) We judged the most successful Daybook item on that particular day to have been the taxi news conference . It had exotic-looking taxicabs and colorful-sounding cabdrivers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mercedes taxis are lousy tippers , because they think the driver does n't need the money . ( " Atli ! NEW YORKERS SNUB DIE FOREIGN TAXI " was how the News headlined its story . ) The Taxi and Limousine Commission had hoped to emphasize the good mileage of foreign diesel cabs , but that tended to get played down . The taxi news conference was interesting  --  no doubt about that  --  but we 're still not sure that it was , strictly speaking , news . We have similar doubts about the Daybook in general . Most of the items in the Daybook are there because someone wants to he written about , and the most interesting news is usually about something that someone is trying to keep out of the papers . The Daybook reports what is expected to happen  --  and is n't news what was n't expected to happen ? Three Degrees WE went tip to Bergdorf Goodman the other day to see the Three Degrees , three black girl singers from Philadelphia who are very big in Japan . Their sung " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , but only after it became a giant hit in Japan . Everyone in Japan knows the Three Degrees . Their manager says that fifty per cent of all foreign records sold in Japan are by the Three Degrees . That is an enormous percentage , amounting to a near monopoly . The Three Degrees have sung songs in Japanese . " Nigai Namida " was an especially successful song for them . When we arrived at Bergdorf 's , we found only Two Degrees  --  Fayette Pinkney and Sheila Ferguson . Valerie Holiday , the Third Degree , was down with the flu . The reason Fayette Pinkney and Sheila Ferguson had come to Bergdorf 's was to confer with Arnold Pitts , a handsome young man working in Bergdorf 's hair salon . Arnold Pitts , who used to work at Satin Doll Coiffures , in Detroit , told Fayette Pinkney that he recommended the China Doll Look for her . " Very blunt  --  with the hair in line with the jaw , " he said . Fayette Pinkney is an attractive young woman with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had designed herself and that was made of matenal she had bought in Hong Kong . Sheila Ferguson was dressed with a certain tailored elegance , in black , and wore a black turban . We asked Miss Pin kney if she had been surprised by the success of the Three Degrees in Japan . " Any time you get to be fifty per cent of somebody 's sales , you have to be a little surprised , " she said . " But I say let 's head for sixty  --  why stop now ? " Miss Pinkney told us that at the time of their first trip to Tokyo the Three Degrees had been playing club dates in America and had begun to be discouraged . " We were at it for a long time , and nothing seemed to happen . Then Richard Barrett , our manager , decided to take us to Japan , " she said . We asked if there was anything that they particularly liked about Japan . " In Japan , they have a ' Cancel ' button in the elevators , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Miss Ferguson told us . " And in the taxis the driver hits a button and your door opens . I like that . " We asked them about their hit song " Nigai Namida . " " Well , " said Miss Ferguson , " we never knew what that meant . " We later learned that it means " Bitter Tears . " ? WITH Richard Barrett : A few days after our visit to Bergdorf 's , we visited Richard Barrett , the manager of the Three Degrees , in a midtown office . He was wearing a chalk-striped black three-piece suit and two impressive rings  --  one set with diamonds , the other set with rubies . He told us he was under extreme mental stress . We asked Mr. Barrett about the phenomenal success of the Three Degrees in Japan . ? " A gentleman mentioned the Third Tokyo Music Festival to me , " he said . " We went to the festival in the summer of 1973 , and that was when we introduced ' When Will I See You Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time , I was under extreme mental stress because of certain business problems , but I expected success . I was not surprised when the Three Degrees won first prize at the festival . I do n't even praise the Three Degrees so much . Every now and then , I might tell them it was all right , but I expect the best always . I insist that they project to the world a first-class image of black American womanhood . I think the Three Degrees are successful in Japan because they are the same as the Japanese  --  humble , honorable , and very decent . Japanese automatically relate to the Three Degrees for that reason . " At the time of our meeting , Mr. Barrett was trying to reach a man at the company where the Three Degrees record . An assistant , a good-looking young woman in a neat , modest black dress , came in to tell him that the record-company man was at a meeting and not free to take his call . " Call back in five minutes , " Mr. Barrett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at another meeting in five minutes , I am going to be mad . " He turned to us . " I 've been out in the world , " he said . " I 've been doing the best I can . But there are some people , you know , try to freeze you out . I have had some trouble breaking in the Three Degrees in America . Some people have given me some trouble , But I got the Three Degrees so big in Europe , in Japan , all around the world , that they began to choke America . " Mr. Barrett showed us some slides of the Three Degrees in Japan . There were slides of a Japanese television program devoted to the group . " That was the first time Japanese TV gave an hour to a group , " Mr. Barrett said . " It was the first time they ever put a kimono on a foreign group . I 've just produced a record in Japan . On this record , the Three Degrees sing in Japanese . My producer backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used five Japanese musicians , who could n't understand anything I was saying . I was under extreme mental stress . But I believe it is a very phenomenal album . " Mr. Barrett showed us a number of photographs taken of the Three Degrees when they were in Europe . One
