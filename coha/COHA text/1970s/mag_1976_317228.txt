The 8th century Caliph Harun al-Rashid once took a Heraclean slave girl into his harem . So homesick was she that the Caliph built for her an exact replica of Heraclea , her native Greek city , at her exile on the banks of the Euphrates . To many the American enclave of the Panama Canal Zone seems such a Heraclea , almost a parody of country-club America , an elegant company town set down in the Panamanian jungle . But that picture is something of at stereotype , as TIME 'S Bernard Diederich discovered when he visited the zone last week . Diederich s report : <P> The rains have begun . Balboa is a riot of color , of blooming red hibiscus , bougainvillea and lilacs . Overripe mangoes rot on the ground . On a weekday morning , the only , sound on the quiet residential street is that of power lawnmowers . Says the wife of a Panama Canal ( Pancanal ) executive : " Do n't write that our lawns are manicured . It gives the wrong idea . After all , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irwin , wife of a canal pilot and resident of the zone for a decade , points to her clipped lawn and says , " It 's for health reasons . Mosquitoes breed in the long grass . " <P> Wherever one goes in this 647-sq. - mi. zone bifurcating the Panamanian nation , Zonians are on the defensive . <P> " This is not country-club living , " they say in exasperation , not the enclave of air-conditioned colonial privilege that it has been portrayed , not an opulent anachronism in a world of nationalism . They point to the termites at work on their houses , the jungle growing up to the kitchen door , the " yacht club " at Gatun Lake that amounts to little more than a raft children dive from , while their parents drink beer and cook the family dinner : barbecued Panamanian beef . The club , like the zone 's four non-military golf courses , was built by the employees , not the company . <P> At times the towns in the zone have the feel of , say , Longview , Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rest of the 35,000 Americans in the zone are mostly military personnel and their dependents - not real Zonians , as they define themselves . A total of 45 churches serve the population . Local Boy Scouts are active . The zone has Little Leagues , an Elks Club , Masons , Knights of Columbus , two American Legion clubs , ROTC at Balboa and Cristobal High Schools , gun clubs , credit unions , six riding clubs , four beaches , four yacht clubs . If it is not an immense country club , the zone does offer the Americans there an agreeable life . Whatever the merits of Strongman Omar Torrijos Herrera 's case for Panamanian control of the zone , few would readily give up their lives . <P> Last week , black and white children were exercising in the playground of St. Mary 's Mission school on Balboa Road , while parents picked over the shelves of the Pancanal commissary , where eggs sell for 720 a dozen and cigarettes $3.10 a carton . On the entrance , across from the post office and movie theater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only an Indian selling " mola , " pretty San Bias Island decorative cloth , suggests that this is not the U.S. <P> Politically , Zonians are a mixed lot .
