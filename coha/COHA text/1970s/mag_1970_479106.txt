NINETEEN-SEVENTY MAY WELL BE remembered as the year of the great drug panic , the year when addiction was a permanent theme in the press and on TV and when government officials and office seekers made instant headlines by pledging a " massive attack " on the problem . People old enough to recall previous waves of hysteria about drugs and similar promises of action view these pronouncements with cynicism verging on despair . They concede , however , that something new has been added . The image of the addict has changed . Suddenly , he is seen not merely as a criminal derelict . He may , it turns out , be a young child who not only knows how to tie a tourniquet around his arm and stick a needle in his vein but also sells drugs to his schoolmates . Last December young Walter Vandermeer died of a heroin overdose two weeks after his twelfth birthday . Since then New York newspapers have published a daily body count of OD fatalities , a phrase which no longer needs explanation . Although the vast majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwellers , affluent America is also represented on these grisly fists . With mounting evidence that this plague can no longer be quarantined in the ghettos , there is less talk about " getting the addict off the streets " and more about what can be done to salvage him . One result is that the treatment of addicts has become a growth industry with proponents of various theories fiercely vying for public funds to support their enterprises . This competition , it should be said , is not motivated by greed . Treating addicts is heart-and-back-breaking and generally unprofitable work . It is a task for zealots . Over the past several months I have taken a firsthand look at what some of them are doing in New York , heroin capital of the U. S. A. where half of the nation 's addicts are believed to live . Appropriately , this city has been the chief proving groundand battle ground for rival theories about the cause and cure of addiction . Paralleling the vogue for " sensitivity training " and other forms of group psychotherapy is the current enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " therapeutic communities , " these arc modeled after Synanon , which was launched in Santa Monica , California , twelve years ago . Its founder , Chuck Dederich , an ex-alcoholie , propounded the theory that the addict can change his faulty behavior patterns only by voluntarily joining a sternly disciplined but loving pseudo-family . There he must be guided by ex-addiets who have unique insight into his weaknesses and evasions and provide living proof that his habit can be overcome . This is accomplished through a " self-help " regime which includes plenty of physical work plus the nowfamiliar techniques of group dynamics which have given such words as " encounter " and " confrontation " a special meaning . Among those attracted to Dederich 's ideas were two psychiatrists , Dr. Daniel Casriel of New York and Dr. Efren Ramirez of Puerto Rico . With the blessing of city officials . Dr. Casriel obtained a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health to set up on Staten Island a privately operated Synanontype institution to he known as Daytop Village . Almost immediately , the project ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reliable ex-addicts needed to run it . After many months , the right man was found . David Deitch , a talented Synanon graduate . Under his leadership Daytop flourished . A play performed by Daytop residents became an off-Broadway hit in 1968 and offered persuasive evidence to hundreds of theatergoers that " The Concept " ( its title ) actually worked . In 1966 , Mayor John Lindsay invited Dr. Ramirez to come to New York to coordinate and expand the city 's battle against narcotics . Preceded by glowing reports of his success in treating addicts in his native Puerto Rico with a mix of the Synanon formula and his own brand of existential psychiatry , Dr. Ramirez found the going rough in New York . The black community which most needed help turned its back on any program headed by a Puerto Rican . The medical establishment was affronted by the claim that nonprofessional therapists could succeed where it had failed . In fact , few ex-addicts went into action , for scarcely any could meet the educational requirements of civil service . The acquisition of buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramirez departed after a stormy year , turning the job over to his deputy , Larry Alan Bear , who now heads the city 's Addiction Services Agency . A resourceful administrator with keen political antennae . Bear , a lawyer by profession , has forged rapidly ahead on the path Ramirez charted . The city now operates a chain of therapeutic communities known as Phoenix Houses , as well as a growing network of storefront outposts aimed at reaching young people , and has embarked on a program of prevention through schools and community organizations . With the help of a private foundation , emergency purchases can be made quickly . A new civilservice category , " addiction specialist , " has been established with minimum formal educational requirements . Part of the cost of operating the Phoenix Houses is met by having residents who are on welfare contribute their welfare checks . Bear has had to expend much of his considerable energy defCnding his efforts against the sniping of private-program operators who miss no opportunity to aggrandize their own projects by denigrating all others . The most strident has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own treatment center , Odyssey House , in 1967 . Like the majority of philanthropies nominally under private auspices , most " private " addiction treatment programs in New York are heavily dependent on government support . Odyssey 's " Mother House , " with seventy residents currently in treatment , has received $770,000 from the state since its inception . Last summer Dr. Judy , as she is known to her charges , moved some 35 adolescent heroin users into an abandoned convent previously occupied by nine nuns , and applied to the state for an additional $250,000 to operate a separate facility for adolescents there . She was turned down on the grounds that no further funds were available for private agencies in the current fiscal year and that Odyssey House was not licensed to care for children . Subsequently she was hauled into court for violating city building regulations . In a press interview she blamed her troubles on the " malevolence " of politicians . A non-stop talker with an ample bosom and an ego to match , Dr. Judy appeared last winter at a televised legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seated on her lap . The audience was moved to tears as he told his story which included mainlining ( injecting into the vein ) , mugging , and pushing to support his habit . The next day I visited the shelter where Ralph was spending his fourth day of abstinence and found him sitting forlornly on his bunk . " It was kinda scary , " he said of his television debut . Shortly afterwards he left the shelter . A New York Times reporter tracked him down in his South Bronx home and asked him whether everything he had said at the hearing was true . " Some of it , " Ralph replied . While Dr. Judy has performed a service in sounding the alarm about a tragically neglected problem , her methods are open to criticism . By preempting the limelight she has diverted public attention from much more extensive efforts , particularly the city 's sixteen Phoenix Houses where nearly 1.000 addicts , ranging from young adolescents to middleaged men and women , are currently in treatment . Each house is run by a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of their treatment . Residents do all the work of the place . starting out as each new house is opened by making a dilapidated building habitable through a strenuous roach-and-rat extermination campaign , plastering. partitioning , painting , rewiring , and replumbing . Cooking , cleaning , and all maintenance work are also done by residents , who start out on the lowliest tasks such as KP and scrubbing toilets . They are promoted to clerical and administrative jobs as they demonstrate progress by carrying out assignments responsibly . and by personality changes which are tested at encounter sessions , held three times a week . There are three cardinal rules : no chemicals : no ? violence ; no threats of violence . Infractions are dealt with by demotion to a lowlier work squad or by what are known as " learning experiences . " The minor offender may incur a " haircut " ? that is , a public reprimand or temporary ostracism by the group . At Phoenix House and similar centers , you also see young men and women going about their tasks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrases as , " I am a baby , " must stop testing the program , " " I am a liar . " There are boys with shaved heads and girls with their hair stuffed into stocking caps . ( " We do n't shave the girls ' hair , it means too much to them emotionally , " I was told . " They tried it on one girl at Daytop and she went into the bathroom and cut her wrists . " ) DLIOENIX HOUSES , like most therapeutic communi- I ties , are coeducational except for the sleeping quarters on the upper floors . There is an easy camaraderie among residents , and one hears over and over again identical phrases about the merits of the program and about " responsible concern " fur one 's fellows which includes reporting their misdeeds or " wrong attitudes " at encounters . Visitors are welcome at " wake-up sessions " held at eight in the morning , where , coffee is served to an accompanimerit of songs and impromptu speeches or readings from the day 's newspapers . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed at a fixed A high proportion of their graduates remain in addiction work as staff members . The most extreme example of this trend is Synanon , which , on the theory that no ex-addict can cope with the realities of the square world , encourages its members to remain permanently hooked on Synanon , spending the rest of their days in one of several outside business enterprises operated by alumni on Synanon property and enjoying lifetime membership in a utopian society . Some do leave , to be- sure . Along with the graduates of other programs , many ex-addicts have proved themselves highly effective therapists and forceful lecturers who have a unique credibility for young audiences . They also tend to attribute almost divine powers to group dynamics , which is , in fact , by no means the sole or even the most promising therapy for drug addition . THERE IS , INDEED , considerable evidence that the THER effective treatment that could be used on a large scale is not psychiatric but medical ? a technique known as methadone maintenance . It grew ? out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Rockefeller Institute , a distinguished metabolic researcher . Seeking an entirely new approach to the drug-abuse problem , he teamed up with Dr. Marie Nyswander ( now Mrs. Dole ) , who had spent twenty frustrating years treating addicts with the methods of classic psychiatry . After trying a variety of possible antidotes to heroin they chose methadone , a synthetic opiate developed in Germany during World War II when morphine was scarce . Small doses of methadone block the craving for heroin . The Dole-Nyswander experiments showed that if the dosage is gradually stepped up , the euphoric effects of heroin are also blocked . Though it is a narcotic , methadone , taken by mouth , causes virtually no undesirable reactions . When he reaches the " maintenance level , " the patient comes to the hospital daily to drink his dose of methadone dissolved in Tang under the watchful eye of a registered nurse . ( At a later stage he comes once a week to pick up his supply . ) He leaves with her a urine specimen to be checked for drug usage by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the standard method of policing all therapy programs . A number of New York hospitals now offer methadone-maintenance therapy under the general direction of the Morris Bernstein Institute of Beth Israel Hospital . the program 's main base . To be admitted , patients must be eighteen or older , with at least a two-year history of addiction and a record of arrests and failure in other types of treatment . Statistically monitored by the Columbia University School of Public Health and Administrative Medicine since its inception , methadone maintenance has rolled up an impressive score , with a better than 80 per cent success rate . As of September 1969 , 2,205 individuals had been admitted to the program . Of these , 18 per cent dropped out . The rest remained in treatment and after three years only 2 per cent had been rearrested : 96 per cent were in school or gainfully employed ( as compared to only 29 per cent on admission ) and none had become readdicted . Figures ? like these do not impress doctrinaire believers in the therapeutic communities , who consider methadone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . Dole , Nyswander , and their followers do not deny that their patients are dependent on methadone . Addiction , they say . is a disease for which the addict needs medication , just as a diabetic requires insulin and the cardiac patient digitalis . So long as he takes it only by mouth and in the proper dosage , the patient can lead a normal life . On the basis of experiments with animals Dr. Dole has propounded the theory that narcotics addiction causes metabolic changes in the body which necessitate lifetime treatment . This view ( disputed by other researchers ) stirs heated emotions in the antimethadone forces who point to the considerable number of ex-addicts who have managed to remain " dean " for a good many years by other means . They also hint darkly at a vast illicit traffic in methadone , known on the street as " dollies " ( Dolophine is the trade name of methadone in tablet form ) . Addicts are known to use dollies to cut back a habit that has grown too expensive . Though there is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it obviously should not be dispensed like aspirin and it is hazardous ? as is almost any drug ? if injected . Furthermore , the end of his drug craving is only the beginning of rehabilitation for the addict who needs ? and is given , under well-organized programs ? continuous help in finding a job and otherwise adjusting to the square world . Methadone is being misused in some bogus programs hastily set up to convince taxpayers that the drug problem is being dealt with . The guerrilla war between New York 's addiction experts took a novel turn last March . One morning at four o'clock , the New York Post city desk received a call from a man identifying himself as Dr. Thomas Butler of Roosevelt Hospital . He reported two deaths due to methadone : one man , he said , had hanged himself in jail after receiving a methadone injection in a hospital ; the other had been found dead in his home after renewing his methadone supply . The caller was at pains to say that " methadone acts as a depressant whose use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more harm than good . " He was so quoted in the story that was published after a check with the police confirmed the fact that the deaths had indeed occurred . The next day , the Post 's able medical reporter , Barbara Yuncker , decided that the matter needed further investigation . Her sleuthing revealed that Roosevelt Hospital had never heard of Dr. Thomas Butler and that no such name is listed in the state medical directory . Furthermore , the medical examiner 's office , which did not perform autopsies until many hours after the story was phoned to the Post , flatly said that neither death could be attributed to methadone . The small dose given intravenously to one man in the hope of easing his withdrawal agonies would have been more likely to cause a high than a depression . The other man ? who was being phased out of a maintenance program at Harlem Hospital because of alcoholism ? succumbed to massive bleeding from a ruptured spleen apparently suffered when he fell in an alcoholic convulsion . The perpetrator of this hoax has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addic- tionn services , Dr. Ramirez promptly withdrew all city funds from the methadone program , which he found ideologically obnoxious . The project has since been supported entirely by the State Narcotics Addiction Control Commission . Known by those it touches as NACC or the Rockefeller Program , this agency also underwrites a number of city projects and private agencies and provides films , pamphlets , and speakers to schools and other worried organizations including some prestigious business firms . In addition NACC has spent in the neighborhood of $150 million to construct and equip thirteen large institutions where currently some 4,800 addicts are kept securely under lock and key and , in theory , are rehabilitated at the same time . The plan was largely modeled after the Rehabilitation Center set up with high hopes in Corona , California , in 1961 . Follow-up studies conducted there indicate that three years after leaving the institution only 16 per cent of its former population are " reasonably free " of drugs . On the basis of early returns , New York State is unlikely to do better . In effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the addicts suffering from many aberrations who have repeatedly failed in voluntary programs . They arrive angry , embittered , generally devoid of any motivation to change . " Some come back here two and three times , " was told by Stephen Chiniund , a young Episcopalian minister who a year ago took over the direction of one of the state-run facilities for women , the Manhattan Rehabilitation Center . Previously he directed two voluntary addiction programs ? Exodus and Reality House . " They do n't stay in any treatment voluntarily , " he said ruefully , " so we have to try to do our best for them this way . " Mr. Chinlund must be credited with trying hard . He has shaken up the staff and has taught the security officers , who are known as counselors , to lead group-therapy sessions . He put the residents to work redecorating the building , a former motel ; the wellfurnished double bedrooms and dining halls are physically more attractive than the girls ' dormitories in some Ivy League women 's colleges . There are classrooms , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours a day . But now that there are no more walls to paint , they have long wearisome hours with nothing to do but sleep , eat , and look at TV , locked on a single corridor . Because all routine maintenance work is done by paid staff , there is no work program and no way of rewarding good behavior through promotion to more responsible tasks , as is done in the therapeutic communities . Nor is there any comparable peer pressure to enforce rules . Minor infractions are punished by depriving the culprit of a cherished privilege such as the pre-bedtime snack . Intractable individuals are sent to " detention , " a euphemism for solitary confinement . The intellectual and educational level of most residents is low , as is the emotional boiling point . Many are lesbians , a frequent concomitant of drug addiction in women . Despite the odds against them , some souls are saved . I talked , for instance , with one wispy black woman who had returned of her own volition for a second stay . " I just was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing me a photo of her twenty-year-old son with whom she hopes to live . " Now I think I can make it . I 've learned to type and I 've got a good job waiting for me . " Immediately afterward I am buttonholed by a hard-eyed platinum blonde . She bats her half-inch fake eyelashes as she recites her grievances against counselors who play favorites , against the boredom of her life here and the meanness of the judge who sentenced herjust because her boyfriend was found stabbed to death three days after she had left him . " I could get parole now , " she says , " but do n't want no aftercare . I 'll do my time here and then I want to just disappear and lead my own life . " A S WITH OTHER COMMODITIES , the traffic in narcotics is a matter of supply and demand . In Harlem , there is a buyers ' market in heroin .

The rise in youthful addiction may well be the result of a sales campaign deliberately aimed at the teen-age and juvenile market ; innovative packaging ? the $1 and 112 bag ? has been designed for this trade . ( The $5 hag is the adult size . ) Because of overstocked inventories , heroin ? long sold strictly for cash ? may be bought on credit . When an addict says , " The man 's about to ice me , " he means that he is so heavily in debt to his dealer that he fears for his life . And in all probability if he does not pay up he will he stabbed or pushed off a roof . In a six square-block section of central Harlem , a militant tenants ' organization , after conducting a door-to-door census last year , has concluded that 80 per cent of the population is addicted and that on every block there are at least twelve " shooting galleries " where addicts congregate for their daily fix . The leader of the tenants ' group is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle manner cloaks a seething rage and an iron will . A few months ago she set up her own addiction program , calling it " The Community Thing . " Sitting in her shabby office ? a store on Lenox Avenue acquired simply by " occupying " it ? one gets a perspective on the narcotics problem quite different from the view downtown . Mrs. Sims sees the " hard-core addict " not as a single stereotype but as two distinct breeds . The older ones , whom she calls the " Bible Belt type " have usually had some stabilizing family ties which gave them the rudiments of a value system . Although they are professional thieves , forgers , shoplifters , passers of bad checks , they seldom resort to violence and they do not operate in their own community . They would rather be sick in the street than do that , " she says . Because they hustle downtown , they are not perceived in Harlem as dangerously antisocial characters . Their loot , which finds eager customers at bargain prices , is regarded as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain admiration for the skill with which they practice their specialties . Some , for instance , have perfected the art of walking out of department stores in broad daylight carrying off two portable TV sets . Others are " cattle rustlers " who steal meat to order for housewives , charging them half the market price . ( The real experts swap labels in the store so that the purchaser winds up paying half the price of a porterhouse for the chuck steak she gets . ) These older addicts , along with all other ghetto residents , view with horror the new , younger breed ? the mugger or the purse snatcher who has not even the skills of the professional thief but is simply a ruthless predator preying on his own people . - " These adolescents came along when our community fabric had fallen apart , " Mrs. Sims says . " What can you expect when you do n't have to walk half a block for a fix , when dealing in drugs is the easiest money in Harlem ? " The Community Thing has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were scheduled for demolition , and is using them for its , own therapy program . On one door is a sign , " Come into my house , child . " Here are lodged some twenty addicted youngsters ranging in age from seven to fourteen . " We do n't believe in encounters , confrontation ? all that , " she says . " Not for our children anyway . They have been damaged too much . They need to find out who they are , to develop some pride and purpose . they need habilitation not rehabilitation . We take them off drugs , cold turkey . Then we try to find out what their thing is and get them busy at it " For some , the thing is " growing something . " This spring a steep slope in a nearby park glowed with tulips and daffodils planted on land terraced and cultivated by some of the children who are being taught by a volunteer landscape gardener . Any addict who makes a " soul decision " to change may join The Community Thing , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit . All are encouraged to go to work or to school and to get involved in community-action programs . Some become scouts for the drug program , roaming the streets , housing projects , tenements , and playgrounds in search of " copping " youngsters . " We also use addicts who are not going to change themselves but who want to help us anyhow , " Mrs. Sims explains calmly . " We need them most for our Special Child Detail Squad . They are the ones who help us find the pawned children . " " Pawned children ? " " When an addicted mother owes her dealer more than she can ever pay , she might become a pusher . Or she might go to work in a factory where they package heroin . If she is really desperate she may pawn her child to the dealer . She hopes she 'll be able to redeem it someday , but she never does . If it 's an infant the dealer may sell it to a childless couple . The eight- , nine- , and ten-year-olds become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little girls as prostitutes for ' specialty sex acts . ' Only an addict can find these children for us . An ex-addict is respected but lie 's nut trusted like the one who 's still using . " Except for a mini-grant of a few thousand dollars from the state . The Community Thing has been supported entirely by contributions , mostly from Harlem people . " Our addicted brothers and sisters understand , as we all do , that we 've got to save our children or we 're finished as a race , finished , " Mrs. Sims says . " Some of the older addicts give us 15 per cent of their take every week . That 's mighty generous you know ? they have that much less left for a fix . The numbers people help us too .

" On rare occasions one of these overlords is seized , and a temporary panic in the street follows . " 1 remember a time like that back in 1965 , " an ex-addict told me . " The story was that the cops had collared a big gumbah of Frank Costello 's and made a deal with him . They agreed to let him go home safe to Italy if he would get the heroin out of Harlem .

However , the drug traffic is no longer a Mafia monopoly ; freelancers from Latin America have moved in and dominate the cocaine-smuggling industry whose trail begins in the coca bushes of Peru and Bolivia and moves into the United States via Miami . Most heroin originates in the poppy fields of Turkey , where part of the crop , grown chiefly for conversion into medicinal morphine , is sold at much higher prices to the bootleg market . It is refined into heroin in Marseilles . There the American importer may pay $5.000 to $15,000 for a kilo , which , when cut , will bring in $250,000 at retail after passing through a chain of jobbers and dealers each of whom skims off a profit .

Meanwhile vigilante groups in some drug-infested communities are waging their own wars against dealers and pushers . Others clamor for higher mandatory jail sentences for drug offenders , despite abundant evidence that this has never been an effective weapon against crime . A few politicians urge us to adopt the British system , under which all criminal sanctions are abolished and doctors prescribe freely to all addicts the drugs they need . This proposal was widely touted in the 1950s by liberal critics of the punitive philosophy of Harry J. Anslinger , longtime chief of the Bureau of Narcotics . Even at that time it was apparent that what might work in Britain , with a minute addicted population , was irrelevant to the monstrous American problem . Most of Britain 's addicts then were wellto-do people who were introduced to morphine during a painful illness . Within the past few years the drug problem in England has escalated as a new breed of addicts have proved adroit at hoodwinking several doctors into supplying them and then selling the surplus .

Sexton has found the Phoenix-Daytop techniques extremely effective in dealing with young people from the age of thirteen or so on up . " Encounters are n't a cure for addiction , " he said . " The problems these kids have are n't drugs . They are really messed up , and so are most of their parents . Encounters are a way of learning to cope with your real problems .
