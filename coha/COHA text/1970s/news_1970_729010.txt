Beneath his tenderness and his gaiety , however , beyond his utterly unsubtle manner , there lay a potent ecclesiastical force . In his 26 years as leader of 1.9 million Catholics in the Boston area and head of one of the most important archdioceses in America , Cardinal Cushing presided over a major period of transition of his church . His prelacy was a period in which his Irish kinsmen moved more surely into the social and economic establishment of Yankee New England to be replaced by Spanish-speaking immigrants who used the church institution as a shield during their own adjustment to a new society . When he entered the priesthood , the church was one of the few avenues of social mobility open to the Irishmen of the slums of Boston .

Skillful Transition On his retirement , ending a span of 122 years during which the archbishops of Boston had all been Americans of Irish descent , Cardinal Cushing was succeeded by Humberto S. Medeiros , a Spanish-speaking priest of Portuguese descent . The outspoken Cardinal presided over the transition of the complexion of the church skillfully . In many ways , the prelate was a Cardinal for all the people . Before such pursuits became standard , he worked tirelessly to build bridges of understanding between Catholics , Protestants and Jews . He preached in synagogues and Masonic temples and Protestant pulpits in what was once the stronghold of Puritanism . The Cardinal 's impassioned plea at the Second Vatican Council for religious liberty and rejection of the doctrine that held the Jews as a people to be responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus prompted the assembled bishops to break a rule of silence to applaud the crusty Bostonian 's heart .

" Of the two or three Popes I have known , " the Cardinal once said , " Pope John was the only one who understood me , and I do n't understand myself . " In 1960 Cardinal Cushing was projected onto the international scene with the election of John F. Kennedy . His closeness to the Kennedy family had begun many years before , when as a young monsignor his fund-raising activities had brought him to the late Joseph P. Kennedy . Although liberal on many matters , there was a strong streak of conservatism in Cardinal Cushing and one leaning or another often pulled him into controversy . However , his support of brotherhood and attacks on prejudice were unfailing . His pastoral letter on race relations was characteristic : " When a Catholic fails to take a stand against race intolerance or prejudice he is a slacker in the army of the church militant . " Cardinal Cushing was utterly without pretense . Acknowledging his difficulty in understanding the Latin spoken at the Vatican Council , he said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a degree . And when I go to the Ecumenical Council I do n't know in the name of God what is going on . " Although the six-foot prelate 's weight declined from 200 to less than 140 during his long illness , he was still an impressive figure . His strong square jaw and bright , lively eyes were familiar at public gatherings of all sorts , where he was likely to dance a jig with blushing housewives , take his cuts during a softball game , or play ( " Very badly , I 'm afraid " ) a guitar . Richard Cushing was the third of five children of Patrick The turning point came one day when he was exhorting voters from the tailgate of a wagon on a street corner in behalf of a friend who was running for the Legislature .

He did later hesitate , however , on the threshold of becoming a Jesuit , only to decide on a , diocesan career .

Even then , Father Cushing was tried and found wanting by three successive pastors , he used to tell audiences later . He then braved the wrath of the crusty Cardinal O'Connell by appearing unannounced at his residence to plead for assignment as a missionary . The Cardinal denied the request , but assigned the new priest to the Boston office of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith , an organization dedicated to raising funds for missions .

" When the aging Cardinal O'Connell needed a new auxiliary bishop in 1939 to replace Francis Spellman , who went to Elevated Railway . His mother , who had earned $2 a week as a hired girl before her marriage , attended mass every morning of her life . One of the crowning moments of her life came when her son bestowed on her his first blessing as a bishop , in 1939 .

Before the year was out , Pope Pius XII had named him as Archbishop . He was 48 years old , the youngest archbishop in the church . For the next 14 years , Archbishop Cushing set about to modernize the archdiocese . His program included the building of new churches , schools , hospitals and other social and educational institutions . Along the way , he streamlined fund-raising , adopting techniques from secular community drives . By the end of his life , he had raised nearly $300-million for the work of the church .

" Nobody can tell me Christ died on Calvary for any select group . " Then , with a twinkle , he continued , " As the feller says , It 's great to live with the saints in Heaven , but it 's hell to live with them on earth ! " The anecdote was typical of the Cardinal 's style of public speaking . He would ramble on for an hour or more , in a voice made gravelly by 40 years of preaching and by a series of respiratory illnesses . He was alternately serious and droll as he pleaded for universal brotherhood . " The ecumenical spirit will get nowhere unless we bring it down to the grass roots of the people , who are the salt of the earth , " he often said . " They may not be too well informed on faith , but they love God .

Father Cushing bent over the man and asked , " Do you believe in God the Father , God the Son and God the Holy Ghost ?

" Lost in Latin Cardinal Cushing came home after the first two sessions of the Ecumenical Council in Rome , because , he told Protestant audiences , he was all at sea in Latin . The Protestant observers , with their interpreters , knew more about what was going on than he did , he said . The Cardinal also liked to tell of a conversation with Pope John . He said he had asked the Pope , " Are you a theologian , Your roliness ? Because all I know about theology is in Catechism Two . " " He said , ' Shake hands ; you 'll never be in trouble , ' " the Cardinal recounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardinal Cushing was more of a cheerleader than an innovator . During a controversy over changes in a Massachusetts law forbidding tha dissemination of advice on cortraceptives , the Cardinal ? mindful that Pope Paul VI had not taken action beyond a promise to have the issue studied  --  advocated patience to distraught women of his archdiocese . No Inconsistency Seen When Dr. John Rock of Boston , a Catholic authority on human fertility , wrote a book on birth control , the Cardinal found " much that is good in it . " Twice he endorsed the John Birch Society , although he personally was a life member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People . Those close to him said that such actions were not actually inconsistent , that he merely was reacting on , the spur of the moment on a secular matter . The Cardinal was an implacable foe of Communism . One ' of his lasting endeavors in that fight was the formation of the Missionary Society of St. James the Apostle , an organization concerned with recruiting missionaries for Latin Amer-1 VATICAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VI received news of the death of Cardinal Cushing with deep emotion today and went at once to his private chapel to pray , Vatican sources said . Less than two months ago the Pontiff gave permission for Cardinal Cushing to retire , one month after he turned 75 . The Cardinal 's death reduces to 127 the number of Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church , including two whose names are known only to Pope Paul . Pope , Hearing of Death , Prays in Private Chapel ice as a countermeasure against the inroads of Cornmunism . With the rise of the " underground church " in 1968 , in which Catholics joined Protestents in ceremonies of breaking bread and sharing wine in kitchens and living rooms , the Cardinal voiced opposition . He inveighed against those Christians " who consider themselves in some way distinct from the rest of us , in some ways pioneering new ways and looking more eagerly than others into the future . " A Smoking Lectern To the nation at large , Cardinal Cushing first appeared as a personality on television at the Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interminable invocation while white smoke poured from the lectern . A State Department official told the prelate , " It 's just steam from a heater . " The Cardinal commented , " Well , I guess it 's being made the hot air from all these politicians . " Less than three years later , the Cardinal again appeared before a national television audience as he officiated at I , the funeral mass for President r.ennedy at St. Matthew 's Cathedral in Washington . But the world had not seen the bluff Cardinal weeping alone in his private chapel on the afternoon of Nov. 22 , 1963 , after he received news of the assassination . Cardinal Cushing was less conspicuous at the funeral mass for Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York at St. Patrick 's Cathedral on June 8 , 1968 , although he presided and was a concelebrant of the mass . The prelate was taken ill on the funeral train on the way to Washington lat . : r and was flown home to Boston . But he was up and around the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an embarrassing episode in his association with the Kennedys came after the marriage of Jacqueline Kennedy to Aristotle Socrates Onassis , the Greek shipping magnate . Shortly before the wedding , the prelate said later , the President 's widow had discussed her plans with him . But he said the visit was pastoral in nature and hence his lips were sealed . However , a few weeks later , speaking before a group of Boston beverage dealers , Cardinal Cushing asserted that it was a " lot of nonsense " to suggest she was " excommunicated " for having married a divorced man . He asked , " Why ca n't she marry whomever she wants to marry ? " There was sharp reaction throughout the world . The Vatican , in a veiled statement through its communications sources , suggested that the new Mrs. Onassis might be considered " a public sinner . " In a fit of anger over the entire incident , the Boston Archbishop exclaimed , " I 've had it , " and declared his intention of resigning his prelacy before the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , contained " the language of the gutter . " Then , three days after Christmas , the Cardinal telephoned a Boston radio talk program to say that a Bishop could not retire without permission of the Pope and that he intended to remain at his post until 1970 . In his last years , the illnesses that had weakened him ? asthma , emphysema , cancer and , ulcers ? appeared to be taking their toll . Although his gaunt figure and twinkling eye seemed to be at nearly as many places as before , there was a shadow in his gravelly voice : No doubt his dismay over the numbers of nuns and priests leaving the church , the slow , sure collapse of the parochial school system , the political assassinations of President Kennedy and his brother , added to his burdens . In a rare moment of public doubt last year , he said : " It seems that all my troubles have come in the autumn and winter of my life . I now feel alone and abandoned . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
