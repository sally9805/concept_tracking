It was quite a coincidence . The way Moscow tells it , the Communist Party boss of every nation in the Soviet bloc - with one notable exception-just happened to be vacationing on Russia 's Crimean peninsula last week . Since they were all on hand anyway , even Mongolia 's Yumshagin Tsedenbal , why not get together for a little fraternal talk ? <P> The missing party chief was Rumania 's independent-minded Nicolae Ceausescu , who was sunning himself on his country 's own Black Sea coast . Was he deliberately overlooked by the Kremlin , or did he refuse to attend what was in reality a Communist summit conference ? The question was asked with some nervousness in Eastern Europe last week ; in August 1968 the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia was preceded by two Warsaw Pact summit meetings from which the leaders of Prague 's " Springtime of Freedom " had been excluded . <P> There are other ominous parallels . The 1968 meetings were accompanied by military maneuvers , and last week a new Warsaw Pact exercise dubbed Opal 71 began in Hungary , uncomfortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-scale war games are scheduled to begin in Bulgaria , near Rumania 's southern border . <P> Cozy Relations . Moscow is irritated with Ceausescu for a number of reasons . Rumanian combat units have not participated in Warsaw Pact maneuvers for more than three years . Under a law that he concocted shortly after the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia , foreign troops may not cross Rumanian territory without permission from the National Assembly . As it happens , the Assembly suddenly went into recess a few days ago . That means that Moscow will have to fly three full divisions , totaling as many as 40,000 men , to the impending war games in Bulgaria , or ship them across the Black Sea-unless it wants to risk marching them through Rumania without official permission . <P> What most unsettles the Kremlin at the moment , however , is Ceausescu 's cozy relations with China , particularly now that Peking and Washington are beginning to speak to one another . The Russians believe that the Rumanian leader helped to open Peking 's door to Richard Nixon both before and during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops stationed along China 's borders and no sign of an end to the Sino-Soviet feud , Moscow considers Ceausescu 's conduct a grave breach of Socialist solidarity . <P> Usual Secrecy . Accordingly , ever since Ceausescu returned from China , the Soviets have been seeking an opportunity to get the Warsaw Pact countries together to censure him for his Asian indiscretions . Two weeks ago , the Soviet Ambassador to Bucharest handed Ceausescu a letter from Soviet Party Chief Leonid Brezhnev . Foreign diplomats in Rumania believe that the letter advised Ceausescu that a Communist summit was going to be held in the Crimea but they disagree over whether Ceausescu refused an invitation or was snubbed . But as one high-ranking Rumanian official put it , " If we had been invited , we would have participated . "
