txt A sharp increase in crimes in central Harlem diming 1970 ? attributed primarily to a rise in narcotics addiction  --  raised the cost of crime to more than $2-billion for residents and property owners there , a study by the Small Business Chamber of Commerce disclosed yesterday . The 42-page study , " Crime : Its Impact on Business and the Economy of Central Harlem , " was critical of current law enforcement in the area and stressed a need for more effective police work rather than for more policemen . The report was prepared un // der a grant from the Urban Center of Columbia University by two black consultants , John T. Patterson Jr. , an urban specialist , and Leyland Hazlewood , an economist . The report pointed out that businessmen believed that there was no special crime against white or black businesses . Chamber members insisted , however , that because of ' limited resources and access , the small black businesses were the hardest Figures Broken Down The $2-billion figure includes the costs of crimes against persons and property , gambling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were calculated at $1.8-billion . Property loss , not linked to narcotics , was estimated at $92-million . Crimes against persons  --  such as muggings and holdups  --  were estimated to have totaled $12-milion , including hospital costs , loss of income , etc . Excluded from these figures were expenditures for public law enforcement and criminal justice and the private costs related to crime prevention . The Small Business Chamber , which represents 175 of the 350 or so small black businesses in Harlem , is not affiliated with the Uptown Chamber of Commerce , a mostly white organization of 225 of the 245 larger businesses in the area . Conclusions were based on interviews with 100 businessmen representing a cross section , along with data from such national reports as " Crime and Its Impact ? An Assessment , 1967 , " ' prepared by the President 's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice . A 1968 Mayor 's Task Force Report on the Economic Redevelopment of Harlem was also utilized , according to Mr. Pattemn . Mr. Haziewood said that by updating the data and interpolating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the comparative crime rates , the Chamber had been able to come up with " pretty accurate figures " on the cost of crime in central Harlem . In that area , for instance , crimes of violence against individuals occur at a rate 2.6 tidmes greater than the national average . Crimes against property are 2.4 times the national average . 90% of Business Affected In questions related to the extent and frequency of criminal activity , the study found that " 94 per cent of all businesses In Central Harlem have been robbed , held up or pilfered . " Further , " more than 80 per cent of these businesses have experienced repeated occurrences of criminal attacks . " One man reported that he had been robbed 40 times last year . Responses also indicated that criminal assaults were on the rise . In 1970 , 51.2 per cent of those surveyed said they had been victims of criminal assaults , compared with 30.5 per cent in the previous two years and 18.3 in 1966 and 1967 . Sixty-nine per cent named the narcotics addict as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime was mentioned by 5 per cent , with only 6 per cent naming hustlers , petty thieves and others as prime criminals . The report stated that many of those interviewed said that they " never see any policemen , " or that " the only policemen they see are in a patrol car . " " A few , " it stated , " think there are enough police , but not enough protection in central Harlem . " Ninety-five per cent felt there was " not enough police surveillance , " and called for more foot patrolmen , preferably in plain clothes . " Others thought that if the existing police force did an adequate job , there would be no need far additional police , " the report said . Deputy Chief Inspector Walter J. Kendall Jr. , commander of the Sixth Division , which encompasses central Harlem 's three preolncts  --  the 32d , the 28th and the 25th ? said the department did not have the manpower to put a man on every corner . " We do maintain coverage , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio cars " are faster and handle much more work . " Narcotics Arrests Up Chief Kendall pointed out that there were 11,762 narcotics arrests in 1970 ? an increase of more than 50 per cent over the previous year . He said intelligence units had been strengthened , bad anticorruption and antinarcotics enforcement units . " As long as we have addicts , " he said , " we are going to have a real serious , continuing problem . The nature of addiction is such that it lends itself to continuing crime . " The study recommended that the findings of the report be presented to the Police Commissioner . Arnold P. Johnson , president of the businessmen 's group , said the report would also be presented to Mayor Lindsay , Governor Rockefeller and President Nixon . He also said funds were being sought " to deal with solutions . " The study was presented at a news conference at the chamber 's office , 2315 Seventh Avenue .                   @ @
