The wholesale disappearance of brokerage houses that threatened Wall Street in 1969 and 1970 was never averted ; it was merely delayed . It began in earnest in January 1973 , when stock prices started on a slide that has never really stopped , and daily trading volume sagged beneath the break-even point ( generally pegged at 16 million shares a day on the New York Stock Exchange ) . <P> Since then , 40 Big Board firms have liquidated or merged , and the survivors have suffered staggering losses-$47.8 million for the 435 remaining N.Y.S.E . retail firms in April of this year alone . Last week it was the turn of one of Wall Street 's oldest houses : W.E . Hutton &; Co. , founded in 1886 , confirmed that it was talking merger with Thomson &; McKinnon Auchincloss Kohlmeyer Inc . <P> Running Out . Hutton , like many other brokerages , is suffering from a shortage of capital . Except for a handful of big houses that have sold their own stock to the public , most brokerages subsist on capital contributed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans mature , the outsiders have lately tended to take their money and run . Hutton 's partners put another $380,000 into the business in May and negotiated a revised loan agreement with two banks ; but even so , the firm last month had less than $1 of capital for every $10 of debts-the point at which the Stock Exchange warns a member firm to act . If the merger fails and Hutton 's debt-to-capital ratio climbs above 15 to 1 , the firm would face suspension . <P> Other brokerages also are scrambling for survival . Last month , Blyth Eastman Dillon broke off merger talks with Paine , Webber , Jackson &; Curtis , then promptly closed ten of its 55 branch offices and fired 350 employees . Hayden Stone Inc. and Shearson , Hammill are preparing for a merger by Labor Day ; reports are circulating on the Street that as many as 1,000 employees will be laid off . Perhaps 100 other firms are talking merger , and the best guess as to how many more Big Board brokerages will merge or liquidate by the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sight to break the trend . Stock prices last week sank to a 1974 low of 791 on the Dow Jones industrial average and closed at 792 . Those brokerages that have invested heavily in bonds have been grievously hurt by soaring interest rates , since bond prices go down as interest rates rise ; and last week rates went higher still . Several major banks lifted their prime rate to 12% , a figure unimaginable until this year . <P> Small wonder that there is more gloom - and unemployment-on Wall Street than since the Depression .
