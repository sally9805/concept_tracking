PAPERBACK HERO <P> Directed by PETER PEARSON Screenplay by LES ROSE and BARRY PEARSON <P> This is a movie apparently constructed around a single picture , an image stuck in the back of someone 's brain that should have stayed there . In any case , the crucial scene in Paperback Hero is the closing one . A small-town Canadian yahoo stands in the middle of the main street , decked out in gunbelt and stetson , calling for a Shootout with the local members of the Mounted Police . If such an image seems both unpromising and unlikely , what appears before and builds up to it is no better and not even as interesting . <P> Rick Dillon ( Keir Dullea ) , small time hockey hero and man-about-the-small-town of Delisle , Sask. ( pop . 700 ) , knocks around a good deal , getting up to no good . He rouses the passions of a loyal barmaid named Loretta ( Elizabeth Ashley ) , even while leching after the daughter of the hockey-team owner ( Dayle Haddon ) and making up to a raucous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next town . Implausibly , Dillon has enough energy left over from these various pursuits to carouse with his lumpish buddy Pov ( John Beck ) and play a fierce , albeit mediocre , game of hockey . As if to establish an affinity with his namesake , the town marshal of Dodge City , Dillon likes to don Western duds and pop off a few rounds at tar get practice . In Delisle he is a novelty . But as this movie amply proves , there is not much happening up there . <P> His woman-baiting and good-timing are meant to seem hollow , pitiful . They are less than that . " You do n't have a brain in your head , " the owner 's daughter yells at him , information that startles only Dillon . Since much of the distaff population of Delisle finds Dillon irresistible , it is tempting to deduce from Paperback Hero the message that the Canadian woods are full of masochists . <P> The men take their lumps on the ice , then pass them along to the womenfolk in the bedroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win some , cockeyed and noble all at once . But in this benighted melodrama , com passion and indulgence are the same , and women are the stronger vessel be cause they take their punishment with a tear and a smile . <P> * J.C .
