WAR ; TORIES by Robert Stone N THE DAY Holliwell left for Central America , his wife had volunteered to arrange the weekend outing of a bril- liant young paranoid .

After the turnpike entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two WWVA eased down from space selling lucky crosses and Christian good fortune . Holliwell tuned it in carefully and between commercials heard a singular musical recitation , delivered in up-country dialect , about a young football player . The youth on the record was his high school 's star quarterback ; it was the big game against the school in the next hollow , and at half time the home team was a couple of touchdowns behind . During the half , the boy disappeared from the locker room , and he was late returning for the third quarter . " Where in the hell you been ? " demanded the anxious hometown coach , who was decent but hard . He swore at the boy and shoved him toward the line of scrimmage . There then commenced an astonishing display of unforgettable schoolboy ball . The kid played like a young man possessed , and the fans in the little country-and-western town had never seen the like of him . The opposition was devastated , the coach awestruck and penitent . Amid the jubilation outside the showers , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youth explained , " my father was blind . " The boy 's father had been blind , and for a week had lain upon his deathbed . The boy had been phoning the hospital regularly , and during half time had learned of his father 's death . The coach cleared his throat . How then to explain the spectacle only just witnessed  --  the sixty-yard touchdown passes , the seventy-yard scoring runs ? " You see , coach , " the boy said quietly , " it 's the first time he 's ever seen me play . " Robert Stone is the nuBy the time WWVA faded out , Holliwell dim . of Dog Soldiers . was aware of the tears streaming down his face , staining his tie , wetting his moustache and the stub of his cigarette . He cased the Volvo into the next turnoff , and sat , with the motor running , staring through the windshield at a row of green refuse cans until he had stopped sobbing . So much for morning drinking . An hourand-a-half from home and he already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage her sympathy and attention , one to save for his return home  --  providing , of course , that both of them returned alive . We 're getting pretty shaky , he told himself , wiping the foolish tears from his face with a Kleenex . It was being forty , marriage , soft suburban living . She gets tougher and smarter , he thought , and I gel shaky  --  a pattern of class and culture . Perhaps he might tell her about the country song but not about his breaking up at the wheel . In the woods beyond the paved rest area and the green garbage cans , a young black man in city clothes was carrying a paper parcel toward the road . He saw the parked Volvo with Holliwel at the wheel and turned quickly back into the maze of pines . Holliwell sighed , put the car in gear , and rolled back onto the turnpike , headed for lunch and New York . An hour later , he was crossing the Narrows bridge ; the harbor and the Manhattan skyline were bright with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of promises . Holliwell 's spirits had lifted in the wastes of Bayonne ; except for a palpable desire for more alcohol , he felt that be was doing fairly well . It would be a drinking day  --  the morning stirrup cup had set off an old mechanism . But his habits had become so generally moderate that it seemed to him he could afford some reasonable indulgence in the field . He took the Belt Parkway northward and fought his way into the traffic around the Kings County Courthouse . He had not been to Brooklyn for years , and being there gave him the mild elation that came with a new and unfamiliar town . The restaurant was on Court Street ; it had valet parking and a few sumac trees out back , and he found it on the first pass . He brushed the cigarette ashes from his jacket , put his suitcase in the trunk.and handed the keys to a uniformed Puerto Rican attendant . McDermott 's was the name of the place , three huge rooms of cut glass , oak , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was great fun  --  and when he thought back on the business later it seemed to him that it was largely the prospect of dining in downtown Brooklyn that had persuaded him to lu with Marty Nolan in the first place . A CAPTAIN IN A tuxedo escorted among the seated landlords and 1 uty inspectors , leading him to a ro table on which reposed a half-finis Martini and a rumpled paisley napkin . ordered a Martini for himself and admired huge mirrors on the paneled walls . The d. had arrived , and Holliwell was taking his sip when he saw Marty Nolan step out of Gents in the next salon and proceed nearsi edly across the hall . As Marty walked , his left hand abse brushed an area below the belt of his dot knit trousers ; he was checking to see if fly was unbuttoned . When he saw Hon. ' , his round face brightened . Holliwell stool to shake hands with him . , " Herr Professor , " Marty Nolan said . His hand was damp , his thick horn-rim glasses seemed almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot in MeDerm there was a line of perspiration below the of his fair curly hair . " Good to see you , Marty , " Holliwell s It would be possible , he thought , to des ( Nolan as fastidious  --  yet there was al ' something faintly gross about the man , suggestion of unwholesome secrets . Nolan raised his glass and they drank " I 'm delighted that you made the time lunch . I 'm honored . " " Not at all , " Holliwell said . " I looked ward to it . " He was privy to a few of Marty No secrets . One was that , during the Tet offers the Vietcong forces who overran Hue had ied him alive , and he had lain in the earth conscious for six hours until a party of Gei medical missionaries dug him out . And on one occasion , Holliwell , vi . from the Central Highlands , had loth manuscript sheet in Nolan 's portable writer with a single sentence at the top c page , and the sentence had read : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whether c this was a libel depended entirely upon sense and experience of the modern wo but the business about " the Jew " was dis ly sinister . Can of worms there , Holliwel thought . - But his ties to Nolan were old and st They had both gone to Regis in the Fift it was . a Jesuit high school that took i smartest kids from the city 's parochial schools . They had both been released int 196Ds from prestigious secular univer ? y had both been to Vietnam in their govment 's service . Marty was peering over his glasses at the m in which they sat . I 'm in transports of Brooklyn nostalgia , " told Holliwell . " I come from Bay Ridge , remember . " Of course I remember . What brings you up I thought you worked down in Wash-on . Oh yeah , " Marty said , " in the Washington t . I 'm visiting my mother . " tolliwell inquired after Marty Nolan 's moth-wondering if he had ever married and ther or not to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it 's a great place , this , " Holliwell said . really old Brooklyn . " hey ordered more Martinis , a bottle of ) arousse . Holliwell asked for a steak and 1 . Nolan the veal piccata . Did you know , " Nolan asked , as a waiter ied the wine , " that Paul Robeson died this sing ? " thought he died in Russia about ten s ago . " Phis morning , " Nolan said . His eyes flashed ck whimsey which Holliwell remembered clearly from the past . " It was on the Well , " Holliwell said , cutting his steak , ardly know how to react . " was n't trying to goad you to malicious faction , Frank . Everybody dies . It just brings back old times . I 'd like to go to his fu-neral . " " You mean officially ? " " Do n't be ridiculous . I 'd just like to go . To see it . " " Think the FBI will be there ? Taking everybody 's picture ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those guys ? " Holliwell , chewing his steak became aware of Marty 's eyes on him again . " How 's your life , Frank ? Quiet desperation ? Self-fuffillnien t ? " Ho ! Ewell nodded and finished chewing . " Last month , " he told Nolan , " my oldest daughter burned herself slightly . It was the winter solstice , and she was jumping over a log with her boyfriend . " " Is that the way they get married now ? " Holliwell poured them both some Barbarousse . " How about you , Marty ? Ever get married ? " " / was married in Nam , did n't you know that ? In the Saigon cathedral . " " It must have been after I left . What 's the lady like ? " " Neat , " Marty said . Holliwell found himself touched . " Is she Vietnamese ? " " Worcester . We 're separated now . We do n't have any kids . " Holliwell nodded to convey comprehension . sympathy , whatever might be called for . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to Compostela for a little something different . " " I fiddled it . I invited my friends at the university down there to invite me . How did you come to hear about it ? " " I had a letter from Oscar Ocampo . He said you 'd be coming down . " Holliwell realized then that there would be a pitch . He must , he thought , have realized all along that there would be one . But it would not disturb him , he decided ; it was part of a game , an artifact of his friendship with Nolan , a little fencing between gentlemen . Neither of them would take it too seriously . " How come Oscar 's writing to you ? I thought he was a leftist . " " Sure he 's a leftist . But we 're not enemies . We have a dialogue going . " Oscar Ocampo was a government anthropologist with a sinecure in the university at Composteta , a gambler and a great womanizer . Holliwell had always known him to be a passionate sympathizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some great arguments , " Holliwell said . Apparently Oscar had stopped arguing . They had turned him  --  either with money or the offer of a job in the States . It was a shame , Holliwell thought , and Oscar must feel very bad about it . " I suppose , " Holliwell said , " that in a couple of years you 'll be asking me to get him a job up here . " " Frank  --  how about doing us a favor while you 're down there ? " Holliwell buttered some French bread and said what he had decided he would say . " If you approach me with something like that , Marty , I 'm supposed to publicize the approach . My professional association passed a resolution against doing favors for you guys . " " Your professional association , " Marty Nolan said humorously , " is a bunch of longhaired disorderly persons . Pinkos , Frank . Red rats . " " All anthropologists are brothers , " Holliwell said . " Suppose I ask how you voted on that res-olution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fork beside it . " I abstained . I was in favor of the resolution , but I felt compromised . Because of what I did in Nam . The favors . " " God , " Marty said soberly . " You 're an honest man , Frank . " " Well , " Holliwell told him , " there it is . As they used to say . What do you hear from Ho Chi Minh City ? " Marty looked at him for a moment and finished his wine . " Not much . They arrested the Hao HOE lot of them were friends of ours and nob bothered to get them out . Look  --  what say ? You want to know if I 'm bitter ? I 'm Neither am I repentant . The other guys fot hard , they earned it . " " If you were bitter I would n't blame You really came through the whole thing di well . " Nolan put his own fork down . They both stopped eating . " What should I do  --  rim for Congress ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terror Firsthand ' ? I 'll tell something , Frank  --  the night they dug me I was in a hospital compound with this Catalonian priest . The guy was walking up down chain-smoking , and they 'd had him der the ground longer than I was . He sai me , ' Hombre , this was nothing . They bu me alive in Murcia in ' 38 , and it was harder . ' " Holliwell laughed and shook his head . " Frank , " Marty Nolan said , " let me you about what 's going on down sout guarantee , you 'll love it . " Holliwell shrugged ; Nolan was lea across the table at him , his eyes shining good-natured conspiracy . " Down in Tecan , on the east coast , evf we sit here  --  some of our countrymen themselves in a state of social and spit crisis . " " Let 's let them work it out for themsel Holliwell said . " All I want to know , Frank , is what th really up to . " " Ask Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right ? Speaking as an Americar payer , I do n't give a shit . " " Oh , Frank , " Marty said . He sat ha , his chair as though scandalized . " Inform is a positive force . It furthers corn/minim It reduces isolation and clarifies motives more everybody knows about what every else is doing , the less misunderstanding is in the world . " " I 'm going to Compostela . I 'm not si foot in fucking Tecan . It 's a rathole , a gets on my conscience . " " Nonsense , " Marty said , " it 's a won , place . They have American-style harp stores , and the President speaks Englisl like we do here on Court Street . " " And he 's wonderful too ? " " He certainly is ; ' Marty said . " He 's a I ian . " " Marty , " Holliwell said , looking aroui the waiter , " get off my back . I 'm not there and I 'm not doing you any favors . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stinger . A busboy took their unfinished lunches away . " On the Caribbean coast of Tecan there 's a little place the locals call Spanish Harbor . A couple of clicks down from Puerto Alvarado . For the last thirty years the American Devotionists have had a mission there , but they 're on their last legs now and they want to close it down . The only people left there are a priest in his sixties and an American nursing mm . Now the Devotionists have been asked about this , and their provincial in New Orleans is being very cagey  --  but it seems that these characters wo n't come back . " The drinks arrived ; Marty raised his glass in salute . " There 's a lot of medieval church diplomacy going on . The provincial says he 'll cut off their funds but he has n't . The priest and nun say they 'll come back presently but they wo n't . Also the Tecanecan government has become aware of their presence and the Teesnecan government is extremely paranoid . " " And extremely murderous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " they 're murderous troglodytes and we put them in . But there it is . The Tecanecans suspect that the two of them are somehow mixed up in subversive activities , but it has n't got a line on them and it does n't want a hassle with the church . " " And what do your sources say . " " That these people are wrongos , Commies , et cetera . That 's what they always say . You know , Teem ' is a special situation it 's still the Fifties there . Our Ambassador is a Birchite moron . The cops lock you up for reading Voltaire . " " Another corner of the free world . " " Do n't give me faux-no if cliches , Frank . Save them for the meetings of your professional association , and someday they 'll make you their president . " He finished his drink looking pained . " Listen , old chap  --  I want to know what these people are up to . They 're my compatriots and erstwhile coreligionists , and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bail them out . " " I 'm not going down there and spy on them . " " Spy on them ? Are you crazy ? They 're already being spied on seven ways from sundown by people who 'd love nothing more than to mess with their private parts . " Holliwell signaled for another pair of stingers . " You 're going to Compostela . It would be the easiest thing in the world for you to get a Tecanecan visa and check out Spanish Harbor . Go diving , go bonefishing . There 's even an Old Empire ruin a few miles from there you to scramble around . The thing is , " he wi on , before Holliwell could protest , " it 's that wants to know about these people . 1 so much the outfit as just me . And I 'd like get it  --  not from some informer or right-w : spook  --  but from somebody with some s sitivity . Somebody who could give me a r insight into what they think they 're do : down there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The last time I thought I was in that pi tion things did n't work out very well . " " So what do you want ? A perfect wor Tell me something , professor , have you stop believing that people have to take sides ? ' " No , " Holliwell said . " People have to t sides . " " What side are you on , then ? Do you rei think the other guys are going to resolve vial contradictions and make everything ok Worker in the morning , hunter in the of noon , scholar in the evening  --  do you re believe that 's on , Frank ? " " No , " Holliwell said . " Well , it 's them or us , chum . Like alwr They make absolute claims , we make rcla ones . That 's why our side is better in the er " Is that what you believe ? " Marty shrugged . " Sure I believe it . believe it too . Anyway I 'm not recruiting and it 's not some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little insi It could he that we have something to k from these two people in Tecan . " " Why do n't you just write them a let Ask them what it is they want down then Nolan exhaled slowly and let his nai shoulders sag . " Give me a brandy , " he told the wa " Two brandies . " He turned from Holliwe look around the room , at the wainscoted ings and the dwindling crowd of heavy-fa hard-eyed diners . " Jesus , I picked this place because I tho the atmosphere might discourage moral po ing . " " It must be you and me , Marty . " A spoiling the atmosphere . " Nolan took his brandy without cerem " This conversation depresses me , " he " because it reminds me that we live in land of total vindication . TV , TV or not I mean twenty years ago we had the total dication of William Jennings Bryan , Father Flanagan and apple pie . Secularise lie made a little equals sign in the air wit fingers ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggheads Commie stooges , and you had to go to I ham or Darlington , South Carolina , to find a loyal American . Then we get fucked up in Nam and Saigon falls and the whole card 's reversed . Hiss did n't do it , the Rosenbergs did n't do it , nobody fucking did it , and Truman started the Cold War . Presently we 'll find out that Trotsky was really a Japanese spy . Total vindication . " " Well , " Holliwell said , " there 's nothing like total vindication . " " Exactly . See , it 's all a movie in this country and if you wait long enough you get your happy ending . Until somebody else 's movie starts . In many ways it 's a very stupid country . " " Are you trying the patriotic approach ? " " Hell , no , " Nolan said , " the patriotic approach is out of date . " They sat drinking in silence for a while . When the check came . Holliwell moved it to his own side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're at a very primitive stage of mankind , " Nolan declared . " That 's what people do n't understand . Just pick up the Times on any given day and you 've got a catalogue of ape behavior . Strip away the slogans and excuses and verbiage , the so-called ideology , and you 're reading about what one pack of chimpanzees did to another . " Holliwell paid the check with his BankAmericard , and Nolan did not move to prevent him . " Sorry , " Holliwell said . " Not this time . " They walked to the front door together and stood beside the parking lot fence . The brisk wind raised whirls of dust from the sidewalk , and Nolan shielded his eyes with his right hand . " When you 're down there you may feel differently . So if I may , I 'll ask you again through a third party . " Holliwell only smiled and they shook hands . It was not until he was halfway across the Brooklyn Bridge that the suggestion of a threat in Nolan 's final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entombed beside the Perfume River , the involved observer of the modern world . A chill touched his inward loneliness . Ile was , he knew at that moment , really without beliefs , without hope  --  either for himself or for the world . Almost without friends , certainly without allies . Alone . W E DROVE TOWARD Manhattan , facing the squat brutality of the new buildings that had gone up around the bridge ; he was depressed and too drunk for safety . The drive uptown left him tired and anxious . Gratefully , he turned the Volvo keys over to the hotel doorman and , once upstairs , ordered a bottle of Scotch fr ( room service . When the drink arrived , he with his feet on the window sill looking ( over the midtown rooftops . On a day in MI he and Marty Nolan had once walked fn the library on East Seventy-ninth Street the way down to the bridge and then aen it , ending up in a bar on Clark Street . It woi have been about 1955 . Hour after hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he moved over to the dou bed , propped a pillow up behind him , a dialed his home number . When he heard wife 's voice on the line , he lit a cigarette . " So you 're okay , " he said . " You got In all right . " " 1 told you not to worry . He had his m icine at the hospital . He was half zonked . ' " So he did n't rave and carry on ? " " He slept . When we got to his house did n't know where he was . " " Does he ever ? " " Sure . He 's very aware . " " What were his parents like ? " " Very middle class . Quite well off , fa ) house . They asked me in , but I did n't They 'll drive him back . " " So that 's that . " " Yep , " she said . " I had my lunch with Marty . We dran lot . " " You sound like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself 110 ? Holliwell poured himself a little Scotch ice water . In the blue sky beyond his wind thin January clouds were speeding over IV hattan . " Maybe I 'll walk over to Eighth Aver For some $20 fellatio . " " You 're kidding , are n't you ? " " Yes , " he said . " Of course . " " Well , I wish I was up there with you . I wish I could go along . " " Marty told me that Paul Robeson died . " " My God , was he gloating about it ? " " He was sort of gloating . " " Listen , " she said . " Did he ask you to any work for them ? " " He had something up his sleeve . I tut him down cold . " " Did you let him know you were may him ? " " I was n't mad at him . " " I think they have a hell of a lot of ner she said . " I love you , " Holliwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you too . You take care too . " He sat on the edge of the bed , drinking more whisky and thinking about his conversation with Nolan . Shortly he began to wonder what Marty had been writing in that hootch outside of Hue , what he had meant by the modern world and by being at home in it . And by " the Jew . " A great deal of profoundly fractured cerebration had gone down in Vietnam . People had been by turns fascist mystics , Communist revolutionaries , and junkies ; at certain times , certain people had managed to be all three at once . It was the nature of the time  --  the most specious lunacy had been conceived , written , and enacted on both sides of the Pacific . Most of the survivors were themselves again , for what it was worth . No one could be held totally responsible for his utterances during that time . The Jew was presumably the one spawned in that Antwerp estaminet , blistered in Brussels , patched and peeled in London . Holliwell knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run a newspaper stand on the corner of Dyckman Street and Broadway . Sy had lived almost across the hall from Holliwell and his mother in a cheap hotel in Washington Heights for ten years and Holliwell still half suspected that Sy had been his mother 's lover . He had never asked . For years , he had worked for Sy at the paper stand , and they had conducted a running discourse on the state of the world at mid-century . Holliwell had learned the words of the " Internationale " from Sy , but whenever Holliwell mentioned church or churchly things Sy would smile with lupine contempt . " They pound that shit into your head . At that school you go to . " Sy was a Communist , he had been an organizer in the merchant marine during the war . Holliwell had found Sy 's being a Communist appalling . lie would bait Sy with the Hitler-Stalin pact , the Katyn massacre , forced-labor camps , the NKVD . When the trucks brought bound , stacked papers to the curb , Sy would cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth at the red banner of Hearst 's Journal-American , " That school  --  they pound that shit into your head . " They would stand hunched over the stacks , in ink-stained aprons full of sweaty change , their backs to the ice-cold sour wind from the Bronx breweries . " What do you know about the Soviet Union ? " Sy would ask . " You ever been there ? " Stung , Holliwell would play his trump . " What do I know about Germany and Auschwitz and like that ? I never been there either . " Sy would stick his hands in his pea-cc pockets with the same wolfish grimace . " Go ahead  --  be a Fascist . Be an anti-Semi They pound that shit into your head . " But he was not at home in the mock world . On one of his last visits to New York  --  had been a few years before  --  Holliwell h gotten drunk to the point of riotous ind gence and he had undertaken a sentimen journey uptown . He had found himself wa ing around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe , and everywh he turned he had seen vistas that were p of his interior landscape , all the scenes of early adventures , imaginary and real . Imi diately , he had realized that the neighborh ( had nothing to do with him anymore . Then he had seen Sy on a bench al ( Broadway in a black overcoat too warm the weather and a cloth cap out of The Gra of Wrath . Sy had asked after his mother . " Alive ? ' She was dead , Holliwell had told him . had gone back to Glasgow on her Social curity and died there . He had said to Sy : 1 thought you 'd be Florida . And Sy had said , Forget Florida . The h. ing animals , they hunt me on the street . T want to break down my door and put a r around my neck . The scumbags , they rui the neighborhood , they ruined the city . Fi ing Lindsay .

While he told the story of Liss . Sy across Broadway , where a Hispanic WOME red boots was leaning against a squad talking to the cops inside . 1-lolliwelPs last of him was walking along behind the we in the direction of the river , hurrying he caught up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel where Sy and Holliwell ant 72 mother had lived was still standing . It was a welfare hotel now , and the junkies were lined up on a metal rail outside , resting their scarred hams on the pigeon spikes , blowing their noses into Orange Julius napkins . This time he would refrain from sentimental journeys and gestures . Sy would be dead now , like his mother . He took his drink to the window to look down at the patch of Central Park that was visible from his room . The lights were going on , the lawns darkening . It was remotely possible , he thought , the depression and the war years being what they were , his mother being whom she was  --  that Sy was his father . But it was unlikely . There had once existed , at least legally , a person called Michael J. Holliwell who was his father of record . The thought of Sy made him feel like mourning , really like weeping . Drunk again , boozy ripe , ready to sniffle with promiscuous fervor over lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The juice was turning on him altogether , softening him up ; it was all catching up with him . His past was dead and his present doing poorly . In his briefcase was an unfinished address to the Autonomous University of Compostela , but he was too far gone , he decided , to even look at it . Hunger made him feel ashamed ; he experienced it as further evidence of his frail sensuality . He ate from room service and nearly finished the bottle . When he had put the empty tray outside his door , he dutifully took up the briefcase and opened it on his night table . After a moment , he took out the address and set it aside facedown . Beneath it in the case were his air tickets and a yellow file folder in which he kept a changing collection of notes and clippings , drawn from the long hours he spent in idle reading . At any one time , Holliwell 's file might contain bits from the Times and the newsmagazines , religious pamphlets , anything which seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper study of mankind . Often , when he reread the pieces in his file , he experienced difficulty in recalling why he had clipped them in the first place . If , after a while , lie could not use the pieces in an article or introduce them in one of his classes , he would throw the entire stack away . The file which Holliwell was bringing with him to Compostela contained only two items ? a National Geographic article on Port Moresby and a letter that had appeared in his local alternative newspaper . Holliwell took the printed letter from the file and set it before him . " Dear Editor , " it began ,
