The productive capability of the U.S. economy is so great that every recession in the nation 's recent history has been caused by a weakness in demand for its tremendous output of goods and services . Next year , though , the nation will experience something new : a slowdown caused by the inability of fuel-short businesses to satisfy demand . Members of TIME 'S Board of Economists warned at a meeting last week that the pause could easily turn into the U.S. 's first " supply-induced recession " ever . <P> That is not an inevitable outcome . Indeed , the board 's consensus forecast is that the slide will be over by midyear , and the economy will then start to revive as the Government , industry and consumers adjust to fuel scarcities . Real growth will range between zero and 1.5% for the year ; unemployment will climb to somewhere around 5.5% to 6% ; corporate profits will be down around 5% to 10% . Consumer prices will rise at a scorching pace of 7% to 8% , at least in the first half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is partly a matter of semantics ; by all normal standards it adds up to a dismal year . But the forecast still is relatively cheerful compared with the dire pessimism being voiced in some other quarters , especially on Wall Street ( see ECONOMY AND BUSINESS ) . <P> Some factors that will keep the economy moving , even on less oil : capital spending will continue to be strong because businessmen will have to invest in energy-saving equipment and processes . Exports will remain high . Consumers who will be buying fewer cars and taking fewer trips will , in Arthur Okun 's sardonic words , " find something better to do with their money than save all of it . " They may buy more TV sets , says Okun , and " I 'm predicting a boom in backyard swimming pools next summer . " <P> The faint cheer , however , depends heavily on two very shaky assumptions . One is that the Arab oil embargo ends fairly early next year . In that case , says Banker Beryl Sprinkel , the economic consequences will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some growth . " But , says Okun , if the embargo lasts all year-and the Administration 's fuel allocation program continues to flounder- " one would have to bet that we would have the highest unemployment rate and the biggest retardation in real gross national product in the entire postwar period . " Harvard 's Otto Eckstein , whose predictions on what will happen if the embargo ends in a few months are among the most optimistic , has drawn an alternative forecast based on a yearlong Arab shutoff : it has unemployment soaring to 6.5% , and the G.N.P . showing no growth at all . Robert Nathan fears that unemployment could even top 7% . Alan Greenspan , a frequent adviser to the Nixon Administration , adds that the consequences for Europe and Japan would be so " horrendous " that they would likely cave in to Arab demands . <P> Free-Market Approach . The second assumption is that the Administration allocates fuel efficiently enough to prevent bottlenecks and insulates the most productive sectors of the economy from the full impact of fuel shortages . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crisis but the handling of the crisis . The real risk is that the Administration might run the program in a weak and insensitive manner . "
