The much publicized grain robbery that has plagued the nation 's export shipments in recent years has resulted in indictments of 52 individuals and four corporations . Last week one of the nation 's largest grain exporters , Bunge Corp. , became the first of those companies to accept the judicial consequences . Bunge , a privately held firm , pleaded no contest to a federal charge that it had for almost twelve years , until June 1973 , short weigh ted ship cargoes at its two grain elevators in Destrehan , La. , and Galveston , Texas . The company also offered no defense against a charge that it used false invoices to market surreptitiously to U.S. companies every three or four months up to 25,000 bushels of the leftover grain-in effect stolen from foreign customers . <P> Bunge suffered only a light penalty : the federal district court in New Orleans fined it $20,000 . As part of an unusual plea-bargaining arrangement , Bunge agreed to allot $2 million to $3 million of its own money over a three-year period to hire more inspectors for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public accountants and an outside compliance consultant . U.S. Attorney Gerald J. Gallinghouse called the Bunge program one of " the most important steps that can be taken toward cleaning up the crime in the grain industry . " <P> The settlement does not affect the cases of 13 Bunge employees , eight of whom have pleaded guilty to theft or related charges . Bunge still faces possible civil suits from the Government , its customers and transportation companies . Meantime , the Federal Bureau of Investigation , the Internal Revenue Service , the Department of Agriculture , several congressional committees and the General Accounting Office continue to probe into the scandal . Their investigations are expected to lead to more corporate indictments.
