As a former Secretary of the Air Force , Missouri Senator Stuart Symington has developed a keen sensitivity to one sign of the approach of spring . " Here we go again , " he sighed last week , as he noted the emergence of " warnings of grave new dangers to this country because of developments in Soviet weaponry . " The annual congressional committee hearings on defense appropriations were under way and , sure enough , U.S. military intelligence had detected evidence that the Soviet Union might be deploying a new intercontinental ballistic missile . <P> The news surfaced in a curious way . President Nixon noted in his massive foreign policy report to the Congress on Feb. 25 that the Russians had seemed to slow deployment of their largest known ICBM , the SS-9 . One explanation for this was that it might " presage the deployment of an altogether new missile system . " When top intelligence officials briefed the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy on Soviet missile plans that same week , no mention of an ominous new ICBM was made . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on March 4 , Symington , who was present , now claims that the possibility was raised-with warnings that the subject was secret . Yet last week Washington Senator Henry ( " Scoop " ) Jackson , who was not present at the committee meeting , spoke on national television of " huge new missiles " possessed by the Russians . Symington contended that the Administration had told Jackson , a hawkish Democrat and a champion of weapons development ( see box ) , to " put it out . " Jackson denied the charge . <P> Warhead Cluster . Was there really a new Soviet ICBM to worry about ? The White House said that Jackson was " very close " to right . The Pentagon confirmed that " we have detected some new ICBM construction in the Soviet Union-we are not sure exactly what it is or what the Soviet intentions are . " Admiral Thomas H. Moorer , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told the House Armed Services Committee that the Russians had initiated " a new ICBM-silo construction program - the silos are unlike any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed that the silos were bigger than those for the S59 and that the missiles seemed to have " a smaller warhead cluster , " and presumably greater stability and accuracy . <P> The Administration used such claims in arguing for continued development of the Safeguard ABM system to protect U.S. Minuteman missile sites . Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird urged Congress to authorize one more ABM installation ( three are under construction ) and give the President the choice of locating it near the nation 's capital or a Minuteman complex-depending on the outcome of U.S.-Soviet arms talks .
