Soviet blacklisters shelve American publishers ' plans <P> Last week , the day before Moscow 's second International Book Fair , Boris Stukalin , chairman of the Soviet state publishing committee , proclaimed that the fair offered " fresh evidence of the . . . implementation of the Helsinki accords ... and the Soviet Union 's constant efforts to deepen mutual understanding ... " <P> So much for the dust jacket . Inside the fair was another story . There Western publishers dreamed of reaching millions of new readers with millions of old rubles . Said Robert Baensch , vice president of Harper &; Row : " We 're planting the seeds , looking for a big future market . " But as fast as the seeds were planted , they were uprooted . Robert Bernstein , chairman of Random House and an outspoken advocate of human rights , was not even allowed in the country . And at the fair itself , inspectors ransacked exhibitions and carted off more than 50 books , most of them American . Some of the proscribed works had been put there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confiscation of Animal Farm , George Orwell 's savage parody of the Revolution , or Alexander Solzhenitsyn 's three Gulags . But other excisions were mystifying . From the booth of the Association of Jewish Book Publishers , for example , inspectors confiscated a book of essays entitled The Holocaust Years , as well as ex-Israeli Ambassador Abba Eban 's My Country . Among the 300 volumes left untouched were Eban 's companion volume My People and Lucy Dawidowicz 's volume The War Against the Jews , an analysis of the Holocaust . <P> Other forbidden works included The Arts of David Levine , with a caricature of Party Chief Leonid Brezhnev . When it was shown that Levine also lampooned American politicians , Ramaz Mchelidze , deputy general director of the fair , observed without irony , " We have different customs . " Publishers may profit from the difference - which might explain their unwillingness , despite loud harrumphs , to pull out of the fair . In the ' 40s , getting a book banned in Boston was tantamount to a free ride on the bestseller list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
