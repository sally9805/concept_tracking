txt This Passover week finds Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin under intense pressure on two immediate issues : 1 .. Lebanon ? and just how far Israel can acquiesce in the growth of Syrian influence , even a Syrian presence there . 2 . The future of the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan ? including Israeli settlement and the Palestinian presence there . On both issues the United States is applying pressure in one direction . and Israeli hard-liners in another . On Lebanon , Mr. Rabin has been responsive to American counsel and has not sent Israeli troops into the country to counter the limited presence of Syrian troops there . On the West Bank , Mr. Rabin has yet to make public both his decision on Israeli settlement and any shift in his policy toward Palestinian nationalism since the latter 's triumph in last week 's elections in Arab municipalities . U.S. Ambassador William W. Scranton spelled out the American view of Israeli settlements on the West Bank in the UN Security Council last month . He said ; " The presence of these settlements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of the negotiations for a just and final peace between Israel and its neighbors . " There are in fact some three score officially approved Israeli settlements in the Arab territories seized by Israel in the six-day war of 1967 . Questions about them include : Dare Mr. Rabin concede that they are not necessarily permanent ? Or ( less explosively ) , shall he put an end to further official Israeli settlement on the West Bank and in other occupied territories ? In addition to the officially sanctioned settlements , there are two others where a Jewish presence has been staked out in defiance of Mr. Rabin 's government . Both are in politically sensitive areas : one , Kadum , is close to the biggest Arab city on the West Bank , Nab* // *W6st Bank // lus ; the other , Kiryat Arba , is near Hebron , where Muslim-Jewish religious rivalry is centuries old . On Kiryat Arba , the government has already given way and allowed the Jewish settlers to . stay . A government decision is awaited on Kadum ? and there have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most enthusiastic backers of Jewish settlement on the West Bank is the Gush Emunim ( Faith Bloc ) , most of whose members are young religious nationalists . It was they - wpo organized the two-day West Bank march from Bethel . to Jericho Sunday and Monday to assert the right ( as they see it ) to establish settlements in the occupied territories . As many as 35,000 are reported to have taken part . The march , which went off peacefully , was clearly intended to put pressure on Mr. Rabin to let Jewish settlement continue . But if there were no incidents along the route of the march , there was violence Monday away from it ? in the town of Nablus , where Arab feeling is particularly high because of the Kadum settlement . An Arab man was shot and , killed by Israeli soldiers and two others were ' wounded . The Israeli hard-liners who are trying to force Mr. Rabin 's hand on West Bank settlement are also those most critical of him for what they see as Israeli passivity in the face of Syrian intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Syrian forces moved into Lebanon , Israeli forces would too . What irks Mr. Rabin 's critics is that the Syrians have been in Lebanon now since the beginning of the month , yet Israel has made no countermove . It is widely assumed that Israel has held off only because the U.S. has urged it to , with the supporting explanation that Syrian intervention is temporary and will in any case ? be held north of a line from which it could conceivably be said to threaten Israel . , British newspapers and magazines reported over the weekend that , in return for keeping the Israelis out of Lebanon , Syrian President Hafiz al-Assad had promised the U.S. that he would agree without cavil to renewal of the mandate of the UN peace-keeping force between Israel and Syria on the Golan Heights when the mandate runs out on May 30 . If this is correct , there are Israelis likely to argue that they have still been forced by Syria to pay a price for renewal of the mandate ? something distasteful to them . More specifically , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Syrian President Assad ingratiates himself with the U.S. and strengthens Syrian influence in Lebanon , and always at Israel 's expense .
