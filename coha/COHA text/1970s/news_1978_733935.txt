txt The performance of New Jersey judges will be formally rated under a " report card " system that is expected to start in the next few months . The idea of evaluating judges ? already tried by more than 30 bar associations across the country ? has ? he support of Governor Byrne , Chief Justice Richard J. Hughes and the State Bar Association . Right now various groups are debating who should do the evaluating and how often as well as how a judge 's courteousness , fairness and knowledge of the law can be measured . It has not yet been decided whether the public will take part in evaluation or whether the public will even be notified of the results . " Report cards are a good thing , " said Justice Hughes . " They certify a passing grade . Dad ought to do a little checking . " " This is sweeping . the country , " said Judge Arthur J. Simpson Jr. , acting administrator of the New Jersey courts . " New Jersey is not going to be left behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; many judges feel they will be treated unfairly by polls circulated among lawyers to obtain information . In most places where bar , associations have sponsored such polls , they have been undertaken at a local , not statewide , level , and judges in those places have been elected , not appointed by the Governor , as they are in New Jersey . Under a plan under consideration by the New Jersey State Bar Association , the state 's 18,000 lawyers would evaluate the state 's 300 or so trial judges . " Improving the caliber of the judiciary , " a Bar Association committee concluded , " involves monitoring the daily courtroom conduct of the judges . " The committee 's report noted that " while some jurisdictions disseminate evaluation results as widely as possible , including local newspapers , it was felt that to do so in this state would smack of a popularity contest . " Under the Bar Association plan , not even the Governor , who must decide what judges to appoint , reappoint or promote , would be informed of the results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges a year , and , as evidence that Governor Byrne is serious about his promises to upgrade the quality of the judiciary , his aides note that he has not reappointed several judges . At the Bar Association 's midyear meeting last month in Puerto Rico , the question of judicial evaluation was debated , and Jerry Fitzgerald English , legislative counsel to the Governor , argued that the Governor should have the benefit of reviewing such polls before nominating judges for reappointment . Mrs. English , the Governor 's key staff member on judicial appointments , has also recommended that such polls be released to the public . " Everything leaks anyway , " she said this week . " And it is the sort of thing the public is entitled to . " Within the next few weeks , a threejudge committee appointed by Justice Hughes and headed by Alan B. Handler , an associate justice of the Supreme Court , will issue its findings . The Supreme Court , the state 's highest court , can then adopt rules for the court system . " There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court system , " said Justice Hughes . " We want to be in control of it . We do n't want to it to be a popularity contest . " Public May Have a Role The Chief Justice said it was " quite possible " that there would be a " public component " to the evaluating committee . " It 's part of a general , growing wish of people to observe all areas of government , " he said . New Jersey judges are already evaluated in several ways . An advisory committee on judicial conduct has the authority to investigate and make recommendations to the Supreme Court about incompetent judges , but in the last four years , according to judicial officials , no judge has been disciplined for incompetence . In addition , several citizens ' groups , including the League of Women Voters , have " court watcher " programs , where people sit and monitor courtrooms . And before he names a judge , the Governor receives a report on the candidate from the New Jersey Bar Association , " Judges feel they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrator . Where judicial polls have been tried , the variation in questions has been great . Some , such as the Dade County Bar Association in Miami , have asked each lawyer to answer one question about each judge : Is he " qualified " or " unqualified " for his present post ? Extensive polls have been conducted by the Chicago Council of Lawyers , the Bar Association of San Francisco and the Barristers of the Beverly Hills Bar Association . These polls have asked between 25 and 30 separate questions about each judge , dividing them among such categories as " legal skills , " " temperament , " " integrity " and " industry . " In New York City , the leaders of the City Bar Association have repeatedly turned down requests by one of its committees to establish a judicial poll . Two years ago , for the first time , the Connecticut Bar Association published the results of a lawyers ' poll of all judges . The publication met with an adverse reaction from the judiciary , and bar association officials are now considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should take .
