It is well after the late news and deep into the monster-movie hours , the time when TV punishes insomniacs with ads for truck drivers ' academies and once-in-a-lifetime offers- " Send $6.98 for records , $8.98 for eight-track tapes " - for Tchaikovsky 's Greatest Hits and the Best of Connie Francis . Suddenly , a smoothly handsome , oddly familiar-looking young crooner appears on a softly back-lighted stage . While he pumps a microphone and purrs out a ballad , viewers begin to wonder : Como 's kid brother maybe ? An Italian Goulet ? Then on comes the voiceover , hailing the " mood rock " sound of that nationwide heartthrob , Peter Lemongello . <P> Peter who ? Lemongello , 29 , is a bland-voiced but relentlessly enterprising tenor from Islip , Long Island . For years he struggled to build a career-through such gimmicks as sending out little boxes of lemon Jell-O to deejays and record-company executives to remind them , should the occasion arise , how to pronounce his name . Now Lemongello and some home-town backers have forcefully raised the momentous question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing himself like so much , well , JellO ? <P> In 1974 Lemongello decided that his eight-year struggle to become a nationwide singing idol was hopeless . Too bad , because he certainly looked the part , with his long brown Prince Valiant locks , rosebud lips and gray-green almond-shaped eyes . He had also had all the prescribed early breaks . He had been " discovered " on the Tonight Show four times , sung with Don Rickles in Reno and Vegas , played the Copa , Jimmy 's and the Rainbow Room in Manhattan , signed a $7,500 contract with Epic Records and toured the top spas on the Borscht Belt . <P> Selling Eggs . But it all turned sour . Tonight said " Enough . " Rickles replaced him with Vic Damone . His record contract , after studio and musician costs were paid , netted him $180 and produced one single that tested well in Omaha but died in Atlanta-after which Epic dropped him too . Even in the Catskills , audiences played mah-jongg while he sang them love ballads , and they clacked their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He quit , he says , " in disgust and revulsion . " <P> But while he was bombing in show business , Lemongello was succeeding in a lot of other fields . In Islip , he turned an egg-selling job into a distributorship , using the profits to invest in some gas stations , which he then swapped for a chain of coin-operated laundries . He was moving into land speculation and home building when he told the local Islip banker who was financing his housing deals about his moribund career as a crooner . The banker gave him an idea : If he could sell eggs and laundries and houses , why not himself ?
