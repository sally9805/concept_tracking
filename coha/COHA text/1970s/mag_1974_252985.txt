During stock market slumps , many a corporation president entertains the Mittyesque dream of buying his entire company back from the public . Now stock prices have dipped so low , even while corporate profits generally perk higher , that some firms can actually afford to do it . Most are small companies that went public during the go-go ' 60s , when joining a booming market was an excellent way to raise capital and also provided the means-through attractive stock options-for luring talented executives . " Now every motivation seems to have gone away . Probably 80%-90% of the over-the-counter traded companies should not be publicly held at all , " says Randall Fields , a California consultant who is advising companies to return to private ownership . <P> By taking such advice , a small company gains several benefits . It escapes the cost of undergoing audits , issuing annual reports and filing information required by the Securities and Exchange Commission . It avoids wrangles with shareholders over corporate strategy . And it can keep secret such information as its annual sales and profits , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International , Inc. is one firm that needed no urging . Findlay , a Chicago-based art dealer with sales of $9.5 million a year , went public at $13.50 a share in 1969 . <P> The price reached $18.25 in 1970 but then skidded to a paltry $3 or so in 1973 , even though earnings , at 86 a share , were at a near record . The company offered $6.70 to buy back shares . Other companies that have taken the same backward step include Ad Press , a New York printing house with sales of $7.5 million a year , that went public at $15 a share in 1969 and paid $3 a share to buy back stock that had slipped to $2.25 in the market by 1973 ; and Houston-based Diversified Design Disciplines , Inc. , an architectural and engineering firm ( annual income : $9 million ) whose stock was initially offered at $12.50 in 1972 and has since sunk to $4.50 . The company says that it will try to repurchase the shares for $7 each . <P> " Small companies need the flexibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Varner-Ward Leasing Company , a San Francisco business ( annual sales : $5.6 million ) that went public at $9.50 a share in 1964 . In 1971 it turned down a dubious acquisition that Varner concedes " would have made our stock look like the fair-haired boy of the market . " Another company did make the purchase , and the price of its stock shot up - temporarily . Varner-Ward shareholders were outraged . If the firm had stayed private , Varner would never have been under any pressure . Finally , Varner and four associates decided to buy the company back . Though the stock was trading at less than $2 , they paid $3.25 " to leave a good taste in stockholders ' mouths . "
