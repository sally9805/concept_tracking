Brokers on the Paris Bourse had never seen anything like it . At least not over something so mundane as a disposable ballpoint pen . Last month , when Baron Marcel Bich sold a fraction of his pen company 's 1,500,000 shares to the French public , investors went into a frenzy over Socit Bic . On opening day there were offers for 8,000,000 shares , but only 300,000 were made available ; the price promptly jumped from $176 to $208 . Helped by that rise , Baron Bich 's holdings in the company that he controls increased to some $200 million . <P> Last week the company got a windfall when the French Ministry of Education ruled that the country 's 4,000,000 children in elementary schools may use ballpoints instead of the traditional ink pens . It was about time . Bic has become a byword in the schools , offices and households of 96 countries . Nearly a billion and a half Bics are rolled out of 20 plants round the world every year according to company officials ; they account for one-third of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annually . Baron Bich has done for ballpoints what Henry Ford did for cars : he has produced a cheap but serviceable model . <P> In 1945 Bich and his friend Edouard Buffard pooled their wealth-all of $1,000-and started making ballpoint refills in an old factory near Paris . Soon it occurred to Bich that a disposable pen that needed no refills would be more to the point . What his country needed , as Bich saw it , was a good 10 pen . Today the cheapest throwaway Bic sells for less than that in France-about 7 . In the U.S. the same pen retails for 19 , and it is the biggest seller on the market . <P> The U.S. provides Bic with about half of its $91 million yearly volume , much of which comes from the new Bic Banana , a fine-line carbon-tip marker that writes like a " felt " pen but is not as durable . Bic claims that in just over six months since it was brought out in the U.S. , the 29 Banana has become the nation 's No. 2 seller in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In January or February next year , Bic will introduce packs of Bananas in combinations of colors ; a five-pack will sell for 99 and a ten-pack for $1.98 . <P> Riding the Wave . Marcel Bich is a stubborn , opinionated entrepreneur who inherited his title from his forebears in the predominantly French-speaking Val D'Aoste region of northern Italy . He abhors technocrats , computers and borrowing money . At 58 , he attributes his business successes to his refusal to listen to almost anyone 's advice but his own . Bich says that his philosophy has been to " concentrate on one product , used by everyone every day . " Now , however , he is moving toward diversification . A disposable Bic cigarette lighter that gives 3,000 lights is being test-marketed in Sweden ; if it proves out , Bich plans to sell it for less than 90.
