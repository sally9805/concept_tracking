Swiss Businessman Rudi Bucher was celebrating his 54th birthday at his home near Lake Como when a congratulatory letter arrived from his brother , Switzerland 's Ambassador to Brazil . Life in Rio , wrote Giovanni Enrico Bucher , 57 , a suave , popular bachelor , was " pleasant and uneventful . " One day , he predicted , Brazil would be one of the " stablest nations of Latin America . " One day , perhaps , but not just yet . Moments after Rudi Bucher finished reading the letter , he heard that his brother had been kidnaped by urban guerrillas in Rio . <P> Not Possible . A man of rigid habits , " Gianni " Bucher had left his house in a residential section of Rio at precisely 8:45 a.m. , and followed precisely the same route he always took for the 15-minute trip downtown to the Swiss embassy . As his big Buick cruised down a busy street , half-a-dozen gunmen in two cars forced it to a screeching halt . They mortally wounded Bucher 's Brazilian bodyguard when he appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a waiting car and roared off . The last thing the chauffeur heard Bucher say was , " It is not possible that this is happening to me . " <P> The generals who have run South America 's biggest country since 1964 could only agree . The military government has gone all out to break the guerrillas , who have been bombing barracks , robbing banks and snatching diplomats for the last two years . Still , the mayhem goes on . Kidnapers have seized the U.S. ambassador , the Japanese consul-general in Sao Paulo and the West German ambassador , ransoming them for the release from Brazilian jails of 60 assorted criminals and opponents of the regime . <P> In Bucher 's case , the price-like the price of almost everything in Brazil-has risen precipitously . Bucher 's captors , members of the V.P.R. ( for Popular Revolutionary Vanguard ) , a Sao Paulo-based group credited with the Japanese and West German kidnapings , demanded the release of 70 imprisoned guerrillas , who are to be flown to Mexico , Algeria or Chile . At week 's end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brazil 's city terrorists have long been trying to provoke the generals into the sort of crackdown that could lead to chaos and revolution . In response , the regime has set aside the constitution , fired the legislature , ruled by decree , tortured suspected terrorists and canceled the political rights of more than 1,000 opponents . But lately the terrorism , which has cost nearly 50 lives so far , has begun to backfire . A growing number of Brazilians are outraged not only by the guerrillas , but also by foreign criticism of the generals ' methods . <P> Six years after the generals ousted President Joao Goulart 's chaotic civilian regime and set out to reshape the country , they can at last point to some solid accomplishments . Exports are at record levels , and the economy is booming . Inflation still plagues Brazil , but it has been reduced from the 87% of Goulart 's days to 22% this year . Employees are being cut in on their companies ' revenues under a new " participation fund " plan , and work has begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
