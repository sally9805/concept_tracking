There is a growing conviction among many responsible men of both parties that Richard Nixon will not finish his term . <P> This conviction is based not only on the arguments now in progress about his guilt or innocence on specific charges but also on a sense of the nation . There is a deep current running against him , both in the affair called Watergate and in the conditions of American life . <P> It is a curious time , rife with opportunity that might lift a President to greatness if he seized the moment , but paralyzing for a leader who appears to have something to hide or can not find his way beyond his own interests to the hearts of the people . <P> Some time before Spiro Agnew quit , the political seer Richard Scammon was asked what was going to happen to the Vice President . " If he is guilty , he will hang , " was Scammon 's simple answer . That response contained a great deal of wisdom , experience and faith in the American sense of morality . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has proved anything , it is that there is still a feeling for right and wrong in this country , and that a pretty good case can still be made that men who have committed crimes are detected . The crimes touch too many lives , leave too many clues , to be covered forever in an open society . Speaking of where the guilt lies , one former campaign aide who played a bit part in the Watergate drama says : " It is Nixon . He is the one . How Ehrlichman , Haldeman and Mitchell go on with this charade is incredible . " <P> The path ahead for the President in Watergate appears to be filled with uncertainties . Beyond that is the growing perception of the incompetence and malfeasance of the Nixon Administration . The best that can be said about the President 's Watergate defense is that it was a bungle . The dimensions of crimes committed under the Nixon banner are now known and understood in some way by almost all Americans . - The history of this nation suggests that when profound moral issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will deny a final , convulsive resolution . Certainly the Civil War was such an issue . No fancy legal footwork or geographic compromises or maneuvers by politicians could prevent the final act of war . Perhaps the civil rights upheavals of the 1960s were similar outpourings that would not be denied . If we have not passed the point of no return on the resignation or impeachment of Richard Nixon , we are very near to it . <P> Events are exploding in the spiritual and confidence vacuum left by Watergate . The economic and energy crises are producing fear and anger out of proportion to their threat to our way of life . In particular , as the economy turns down and jobs are lost in the months ahead , this anger is likely to be directed against Nixon . <P> The truckers who blocked the highways are the most recent and visible protesters . Airline pilots , upset by job cutbacks , threaten a Christmas boycott . Wherever one travels , there is a feeling of disillusion among the groups now being touched by crisis and material shortage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raw edges of panic with their Wall Street colleagues . Many in the resort trade are petrified . The trade conventions of men in the petrochemical industry are held under a cloud of doubt . The immense plastics industry is nearing a slowdown .
