ICE AGE <P> by TANKRED DORST <P> Knut Hamsun was a hero to his fellow Norwegians and a novelist who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1920 . But in the ' 30s , he espoused Nazism , and when the Germans invaded Norway in 1940 , he collaborated with them , later even wrote a glowing obituary of Hitler . After the war , he scarcely deigned to offer any explanation , nor would he acknowledge the slightest regret . <P> It is on the postwar years of this grim eccentric that Tankred Dorst , a West German playwright who was a P.O.W. in the U.S. , has based his play . He asks an enormous imaginative effort from a European or U.S. audience : the moral issues of World War II still seem crystal clear to the countries that fought Hitler . Stereotypes about people therefore persist . Yet Dorst commands respect for Hamsun as a man who above everything else must be true to himself- whether he is right or wrong is to him irrelevant . With masterly compression , the novelist 's years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme form of personal integrity that far transcends its shoddy circumstances . <P> Hamsun is housed in an old-folks home while the government ponders what to do with him . The psychiatrists are baffled and so are the official interrogators , who seem gradually reduced to bullies out to crack a 90-year-old man . Hamsun remains impervious . He is possessed by neither God nor the devil and certainly not by Hitler , whom he disliked , but apparently by a fiercely primitive individuality that remains unyielding to all external forces , including the government of Norway . It is one of Dorst 's achievements that a thousand questions about the debts owed by the citizen to the state and vice versa press wordlessly on the action . Roberts Blossom is a tremendous Hamsun , a man who sees the world narrow but himself whole . Unpitiable and pitiless , Hamsun retains to the end the stature of King Lear before his arteries hardened . <P> G.M.
