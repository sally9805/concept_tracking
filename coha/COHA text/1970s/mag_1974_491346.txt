After a lifetime of casting about in the depths of female psychology , Sigmund Freud made this anguished entry in his diary : " What do women want , My God , what do they want ? " The feminist answer is : " By God , they want Freedom ! " They want to be free , as men are free , to fulfill their own potentials and to seek their own identities . They want political , economic , and social equality with men . And this equality , the feminists contend , is being denied them by overt and covert masculine coercion The feminists would seem to have their work cut out . Male supremacy is the most obvious and massive fact of our society . All our social institutions that exercise power , generate wealth , create the law , form the minds , and guide the actions and opinions of society are male dominated . The government , military , judiciary , labor unions , churches , universities , communications and advertising media , the banking , production , insurance , and transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , medicine , engineering , architecture ) are male oriented . Men make all the crucial decisions for society . In all our great institutions , whether public or private , there are not a hundred women who occupy high policy-making positions . The sporadic appearance of women in so-called top-level appointivd political jobs is still largely female tokenism . Of America 's 80 million adult women , only 30 million are gainfully employed . Although women twenty and over now account for one-third of the labor force , the vast majority are working in menial , sex-typed , or dead-end jobs . Women are the " domestics " of the Male Establishment . The only institution in which women appear in equal numbers with men is our institution of monogamous marriage ( 80 percent of all adult women are or have been married ) . Legally , marriage is the most male-dominated institution of all . It is the only institution in which women are expected to work without receiving any stipulated wages and with no fixed working hours . A woman who enters marriage penniless ( as most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , board , clothing , and whatever monies she may need for running his house and caring for their children . He can give her as much or as little as he chooses . She has no legal claim to any part of his property or income . He is legally responsible for her current debts , but he can also legally disavow future responsibility whenever he finds it too onerous . If the marriage ends in divorce , the wife must go to work to support herself , or she must de-pend either on her ex-husband 's charity or on the charity of the courts . This charitable handout is called alimony . Permanent alimony is awarded in only 2 percent of all divorces , and the average alimony award is less than 30 percent of the ex-husband 's wages . In awarding child support , the majority of judges generally expect able:bodied women to go to work and to assume half the cost of supporting their children . The economic problem divorce presents to women with children is told in these statistics : The median income of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black men , $4,274 ; of white women , $2,448 ; of black women , $2,145 . ( College-educated women earn less than Negro men with eight years of education . ) One out of three marriages , nevertheless , ends in divorce . The rate would certainly be higher if women were not faced with the economic problems suggested by the above statistics . A recent government study of marriage , made on a nationwide basis , shows that only three out of twenty women profess to be happily married . Seven out of twenty " get along " but fight a lot . Ten out of twenty confess to being unhappy but stick to their mates for " practical reasons . " Men come unstuck more easily than women . More than half the divorces granted are instigated by husbands . Husbands instigate the overwhelming number of divorces involving wives over forty . Many marriages end in the husband 's desertion of the wife . Desertion , the " poor man 's divorce , " does not show up in the statistics . The average woman who leaves marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal older , and far less able to find employment with wages above the poverty level . About 40 percent of all families with a female head are below the poverty level . In every marriage there are two marriages , his and hers . His is better . It 's a man 's world , no two ways about it . The second obvious fact about our society is that , married or unmarried , this is the way most women seem to like it . The married , however , like it better . Given a ( pollster 's ) choice between the unpaid and increasingly insecure job of " married woman " and any of the other jobs that the Male Establishment offers , women opt overwhelmingly for the job of homemaker . Hands down they prefer the gratifications of motherhood , the privileges of wifehood , and the status conferred by society on the title Mrs. to the condition of the unmarried woman working in a man 's world . But married or unmarried , happy or miserable , the vast majority of women accept their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the efforts of the organized and activist 20 THE S.RTURDAY EVENING POST January /February ' 74 feminists to achieve sex equality . they are openly hostile to them . A recent survey showed that more women than men accept the stereotype view of Women 's Liberationists as sexually frustrated , hysterical , and unfeminine creatures who , if not " old bags , " are probably lesbians . The fight of any group , class , or minority for equality in a democratic society must be waged in many ways and at many levels . But if it is to be made " within the system , " it has to be energetically fought at the ballot box and in the courts . Women have had the vote for half a century . Unlike the blacks or Chicanos , women are not a political minority . They represent-51 percent of the electorate . They are a political majority that is treated as a minority . If women , as a class , were to demand legal equality , vote-hungry politicians ( a tautological phrase ) could not afford to deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such demand . A case in point is the history of the Equal Rights Amendment . In 1923 a group of militant suffragettes , elated by their success in securing the basic right of every freeborn citizen  --  the vote  --  presented a bill to Congress to make women first-class citizens in the eyes of the Constitution . The language of the Equal Rights Amendment bill was simple : " Equality of Rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged in the U.S. or by any state on account of sex . " The bill was sent to the House Judiciary Committee where it remained bottled up for forty-seven years . The rationale of the Congress , totally dominated by males , was that while passage of the bill would give women the same legal rights as men , it would also result in their losing a handful of legal " privileges . " One of these privileges was exemption from military service . The main objection made to it , however , was that it might relieve husbands of their legal responsibility for child support . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost half a century women voters did not exert enough pressure on the Congress even to have the bill debated on the floor . Many women 's clubs and organizations refused to support it . ( This was par for the feminist course : in 1912 , a decade before women 's suffrage was passed , the General Federation of Women 's Clubs refused to endorse votes for women . ) The Equal Rights Amendment bill was finally passed on March 22 , 1972 . But it now requires the ratification of thirty-eight states , thirty of which had ratified it as of September 1973 . If the same consideration ( or lack of consideration ) is given to it by the states as it has received from the Congress , and if women voters continue to remain indifferent to its passage , it could be two or three decades before the Constitution recognizes women as first-class citizens . All surveys show that the majority of married women prefer to leave political questions  --  even those adversely affecting their own personalrights  --  in the hands of their husbands . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economically , dependent on men . The temptation is to leave the feminist question right there . It 's a free society , and its female citizens have the right to pursue life , liberty , and happiness in any way they choose . If they prefer the feminine gratifications and privileges of marriage to the rights enjoyed by men , if they do n't feel themselves to be an oppressed class , well , whose business is it but theirs ' ? Nevertheless , the widespread indifference of women to their own unequal status in a so-called free society calls for some rational explanation . The antifeminist point of view was never more clearly expressed than in an editorial in the New York Herald of September 12 , 1852 . The editor ( probably the great James Gordon Bennett ) , commenting on a women 's suffrage meeting in Syracuse , N.Y. , wrote : Hew did woman first become subject to man , as she is all over the world ? By her nature , her sex , just as the negro is and always will be to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , doomed to subjection ; but she is happier than she would be in any other condition , just because it is the law of her nature . The antifeminist today , as well as yesterday , holds that the physiological and psychological differences between the sexes determine the roles they play  --  and prefer to play  --  as well as their condition in society . These differences are genetically and biologically ordained . Each sex possesses a " true nature . " Woman 's true nature is submissive , passive , dependent , and emotional . ( Other adjectives often added are patient , nurturant , faithful , uncreative , and self-sacrificing . ) She is born with a " feminine mentality . " The true nature of man is dominant , active , independent . He is born with a " masculine mentality . " To boil this proposition down to simple language , woman thinks with her womb , man thinks with his penis . Their different " mentalities , " so to speak , actually exude from their genital organs . ( Freud and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute accord on the proposition that anatomy is destiny . It is the ancient and traditional proposition of Judeo-Christian civilization . ) So , say the antifeminists , there really is no masculine discrimination or coel cion against women after all . Wornen  --  at least " real women " ? know what they are and what they really want . They want men to dominate them . And , give a little here or take a little there  --  maybe equal wages for equal work , for example  --  women want to be unequal . The standard ( though not yet traditional ) position of the Women 's Liberationists is that , while woman 's reproductive system differs from man 's , there are no other natural differences between them . ( Pause , for male chauvinists to say vive la diffirence . ) Some Women 's Liberationists posit a sort of prehistoric , Amazonian matriarchy in which women were once not only the natural equals of men but may have been their superiors . They also posit a time when man . more or less consciously , decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , and to subjugate and exploit and enslave her for his own pleasure and profit . This he was able to do because her repeated pregnancies made her physically vulnerable . He then decreed that her physical vulnerability was evidence of her psychological inferiority . Why , Women 's Liberationists ask , if woman was indeed born to be submissive , did man find it necessary to use brute force to put  --  and keep her down ? ( A very good question , really . Freud in his struggle to an- swer it came up with a melancholy solution : Woman is , by nature , masochistic ; man is , by nature , sadistic . She enjoys physical suffering ; he enjoys inflicting it . Altogether a dim view of both natures . ) After centuries of physical violence , man finally hit upon the use of the carrot , as well as the stick , as the way to reconcile woman to her condition of servitude . He denied her all her rights but gave her certain privileges . Using the techniques that today are known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man now calls woman 's natural feminine mentality is the unnatural slave mentality he forced on her , just as he forced it on the blacks . He made her the " house nigger . " ( Many Women 's Liberationists see women as " nigger. " ) in the end , man dropped the shackles from woman 's body only because he had succeeded in fastening them on her mind . This , according to the Women 's Liberationists , he finally did only very recently . Man did not grant woman the vote until he was reasonably certain that her slave mentality had become second nature and that she would not act to bring about her own emancipation . But he is still taking no chances . Uppity wives are divorced and replaced by more submissive  --  and usually younger  --  ones . Uppity female employees , who insist on equal wages for equal work or who organize to protest discrimination , are eased out or fired . Only submissive employees are permitted to survive in the male chauvinist world . Pretty employees who are willing to submit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberationists , is now standard office equipment ) are given small privileges , small pay raises , and ( sometimes ) small promotions . Uppity professional women are ridiculed . ( They are called pushy , aggressive , mannish , unfeminine , sexually frustrated , etc . ) Altogether , the Male Establishment never lets women forget that they are all but valueless to society except as sex objects ( submissive vaginas and fruitful wombs ) and as devoted domestic servants ( at home or at work ) of their superior menfolks . Male chauvinism is the great self-serving masculine put-down of woman  --  the violation and despoliation of her true nature . Insofar as both arguments rest on the theory that each sex has a true nature that determines its social behaviour , roles and status , both arguments rest on a theory that can not be proved . Humans are never to be found living in nature  --  the only place where their " natural " behaviour might be studied . Male and female , they are always found living in society . In the many historical and anthropological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an astounding variety of behaviour patterns and played an amazing diversity of roles . Copulation , pregnancy , and childbirth are not social roles . They are biological functions . ( The only role that can not be divorced from the sexual function is the role of professional prostitute  --  male or female  --  whence it is called the oldest profession . ) While whole psychologies have been written about the desire of one sex to possess the genital organs of the other ( womb envy , penis envy ) , each sex is inescapably stuck with its own biolo-gical functions and can not transfer them to the other . But roles ( the parts people choose or are given to play in life ) are both assignable and transferable . Generally , they are assigned  --  or re-assigned  --  according to the preferences or Continued on page 91 WOMANs A TECHNOLOGfiCAL CASTAWAY continued from page 21 prejudices of those who dominate the society . Sometimes a social emergency , great or small , causes a sudden reassignment of roles . War comes , and Rosie the housemaid becomes Rosie the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby and does the housework . Both riveting and child care are assignable and reassignable roles . The assignment of roles to the sexes is often wholly arbitrary . Once a role is assigned , however , the tendency is to give the assignment the force of natural law , either directly or a deuxi  --  me main . Riveting is " naturally " man 's work . But Rosie is doing this " unnatural " work only because it is " natural " for woman to back up her fighting man . Woman , " by nature , " is supportive of masculine efforts . In American pioneer days , it was " natural " for the pioneer wife to drive mule teams and covered wagons over uncharted deserts and mountains , and when necessary to shoot Indians . A few decades later , President Grover Cleveland announced that " woman is too frail to conduct an automobile . " The driving role was not " natural " to women because handling machinery , as every man knows , is not " natural " to women . Today society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " natural " for her to do the family shopping and take the kids to school . But her subservient role as wife requires her to relinquish her driver 's role to her husband when he and she are in the car- especially when they are with another couple . What is at stake is his masculine ego , involved in the traditional assumption ? belied by all insurance statistics -- that any man is " by nature " a better driver than any woman . In history women have played , at one time or another , every role that man has ever played , from absolute monarch to coal miner , from warrior to garbage collector . ( She has , albeit rarely , played the " big brain " role . The only person to receive the Nobel Prize twice for science was Marie Curie . Her daughter , who was trained to be a scientist , also received it . ) There is , however , one consistent historical pattern that runs through the role of role assignment . Men are the role assigners , and they assign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prejudices . Prestigious and profitable roles are invariably assigned by men to men . Nonprestigious and unprofitable roles are assigned to women . Men are assigned the teaching role of teaching men , and not teachingwomen , to assume prestigious and profitable roles . The assignments come first ; the law of nature bit comes after . Superior work is man 's work because man is naturally superior ; women is naturally inferior , so woman 's work ( whatever the assignment ) is therefore inferior . The method of assigning roles is self-validating . In the United States , our industrialized , capitalistic society has witnessed the most extraordinary reassignment of " feminine roles " to men ( and vice versa ) that has ever occurred in human history . For centuries , in Judeo-Christian society , " woman 's work " was the entire preparation of food , the production of household utensils , garments , and necessities ( soap , medicines , candles , etc. ) , the care of farm animals , and to a large extent , work in the fields ( agriculture ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothering a vast brood of children ) were " woman 's " work . Weaving was , perhaps , woman 's most prestigious work ( whence , even today , women are sometimes referred to as the distaff side ) . Woman was the first industrialist . Today all the weaving , almost all the preparation and production of food , and the manufacture of allhousehold equipment and utensils are " man 's work . " Man is now the weaver , baker , butcher , candlestick maker , pot-and-pan manufacturer of society . There is almost no productive domestic task , once traditional and " natural " to woman , that man has not taken over . Even that most " natural " of all feminine tasks , washing the baby 's diapers , has become man 's work . The president of Tidy Diddle Diaper Service is a man , not a woman . So are the heads of the companies that make tampons for menstruating women . It would be nice to think that man took over all this woman 's work  --  and these " feminine roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , is that he took it over because he saw ways to make it profitable . ( Profiting from work is " natural " to man . Unprofitable work is " natural " to women . ) In the United States two vast national emergencies have forced men to reassign many of their profitable industrial roles to women . During World Wars I and II , women were permitted to fill an amazing variety of roles that men had considered them " naturally " too weak , too sensitive , or too stupid to fill . Women filled many of them so well that , when the boys came home , many q employers let the women go only because the law required them to do so . ( The women were often better , more reliable , and definitely cheaper workers . ) The impact of technology and science on woman 's world  --  the home  --  has been psychologically devastating to her precisely because it has divested her of so many traditional feminine roles that , however onerous , had given not only her personal life its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , woman 's traditional housewife 's and child-bearing roles are in a rapid state of occupational decline . Jeanne Binstock , a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts at Boston , points out that " mother care , " which was once an eighteenhour-a-day chore , has now been reduced to a four-hour service . Diaper services , convenience foods , wash-and-wear clothing , new children 's medicines have saved Mom hours of child care and concern . An amazing battery of automated household equipment and precooked or convenience foods has reduced the housewife 's role to a point where more than half of what she does today is gratuitous make-work . ( The time that American women spend in window-shopping is a scandal to many Europeans . ) The married woman has long since ceased to be a producer of goods . She has become , par excellence , a consumer . With a life expectancy of seventy-three and one-half years , a twentyyear-old woman with two children can count on about twenty years free from necessary child care and housework . The question that the Male Establishment must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with this free time that his technology has given her , and what status is he willing to confer on her for doing whatever it is that he thinks she should be doing ? Man has insisted on making all the crucial decisions for woman . He is now faced with making the most crucial decision he has ever been asked to make about her  --  and himself , Her future happiness , and his , and the welfare of society depend on his answer . How does he see the " role of woman " in today 's world , which is not yesterday 's world ? To come to the nitty-gritty , what does he think about the importance of her motherhood role in our overpopulated world ? Throughout most of human history the world was underpopulated . Man 's broad back and woman 's wide pelvis were the prime tools of human progress . Without plenty of muscles and plentiful wombs , civilization could not have been created . Man placed a high value on motherhood . The " mother of many " was given great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that birth control , abortion , infanticide , and child abandonment were , until most recent times , almost universally considered feminine crimes against nature and were severely punished . For millenniums the image of the Madonna and Child ( male ) was Christianity 's most revered image . Man esteemed woman  --  and consequently woman esteemed herself  --  as the necessary and glorious procreative function of society . tier greatest function was childbearing , her greatest role was child care . Most of her privileges and gratifications. private and public , stemmed from fulfilling her biological function and playing her child-caring role . What human dignity and " superiority " she enjoyed , even in the eyes of her husband , stemmed from being the mother of his children . The childless wife was disesteemed . The spinster was an object of pity or ridicule . The persistence of this attitude of woman herself toward the status that motherhood conferred is exemplified in a Washington Star interview ( August S , 1972 ) with Eunice Kennedy Shriver , wife of Sargent Shriver and mother of five of Rose Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Shriver considers Motherhood the noblest profession " ( the best of all feminine careers ) . She feels that while " Women 's Lib has been good on job-discrimination and things likethat , it 's resulted in the down-grading of the whole concept of Motherhood . " It 's not Women 's Lib , of course , that is downgrading the motherhood profession ; it is the awesome and terrible and ever more visible fact of overpopulation  --  or , rather , the consequences of overpopulation ( crime , pollution , crowding , political disorders , famine , disease , the threat of nuclear war , etc . ) . Says Binstock , " A reduction in the occupation of ' Mother ' is now mandatory ... we are face to face with the fact that if we do not take from women their role of mother and replace it with something else , we will be throttled with the overproduction of babies . " Men who have begun to use computers on difficult problems rather than their brains ( on the whole , a benign development in human affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's natural and traditional pursuit of the profession or career of motherhood may be even more dangerous for society than his own traditional pursuit of war . Men have concluded that the uncontrolled fecundity of woman is out . And birth control is in . Men have given their social approval to the use of the Pill . They are no longer horrified by the prospect of legal abortion , on demand , in all of the states . Mandatory vasectomies are even being proposed for men . There is already much talk in the 94 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January IFebruary ' 74 ( male-dominated ) press about the possible future need to sterilize women after the birth of a second child . And there goes the only status career men have allowed women . How often in a lifetime she will be permitted to give birth , he will determine in the future . At present he expects ( society expects ) she will limit herself to two children . Man is doing his bit , together with the Women 's Liberationists , to downgrade motherhood . Consequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is increasingly plunking for easy divorce-no-fault divorce-or divorce on demand , his and hers . His traditional resistance to " letting his wife work " is collapsing fast . Today 62.5 percent of all women who are working are married women . He is not only permitting his wife to play the dual role of unpaid housekeeper and underpaid wage earner , he is encouraging her to do so . What man is not doing is to help woman to find , outside the home , roles that will confer on her some of the status that wifehood and motherhood have given her in the past . Man is leaving woman emotionally , physically , and economically underemployed . The result of this cruel and appallingly stupid failure in man 's relations with woman is that women are having what psychologists call identity crises all over the lot . They do n't know who they are or what they are . They do n't know what they are good for anymore . They do n't know where they are really needed , or what society expects of them now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are in the process of making a painful discovery : the only world that ever was really " woman 's world " ( the world where she was dominant ) was the nursery . The nursery was the only place where she was ever really needed-where she was ( when the cradle was full ) irreplaceable . The only place where she was superior and was looked up to , not looked down on . Where someone was inferior to her . Where she had authority . Where others were deeply dependent on her . Where her love was freely given and freely returned . Where she could be herself . At the core of that ugly phenomenon of 20th-century life called Momism lies woman 's fear of her loss of status as mother and her return to the inferior status as wife . Momism is the empty-cradle syndrome which so many women are having today . If woman must now leave the nursery and the career of keeping the cradle full , what will she do , what can she do , but , especially , what will man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cause man to esteem her ? For countless ages women have been conditioned to believe that the meaning-the only meaning-of a woman 's life is maternity . What is her traditional role as wife worth to her - or to him-if she is not to be the mother of many children ? To both of them , perhaps , very little . " If it were n't for the children , I 'd get a divorce " is a phrase that passes both masculine and feminine lips with increasing frequency . Women are not stupid-as men have sometimes observed despite woman 's best effort to seem so . They see quite clearly the only career that seems to await them in the Male Establishment-to become , at best , the " office wife " ; at worst , a dead-end sex-typed employee . And all the way down the line-no status . Marriage and two children-or even one-is better . The stupidest and most inferior human being can not long endure a life in which he , or she , does not experience some measure of social approval and acceptance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how hard he or she tries . The awareness , conscious or unconscious , of women today that their traditionally full-time roles of wife and mother are in a state of decline , and that no other roles are open to them that promise them the same gratifications , is at the root of most of the restlessness , discontent , and psychological hang-ups they are experiencing . They are literally being driven crazy , not because they do n't know what to do with their " free time " but because they think that men do n't really give a hoot what they do with it , providing what they do does n't cost men too much money or otherwise inconvenience or distract them . The time has come when men must care-if not for woman 's sake , for man 's . The bright boys- that is to say , men who are smart enough to forget their prejudices against women long enough to feed the Woman Problem into the computers- have already gotten some pretty clear answers on why they had better begin caring . They already have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth control ( and , fortunately , there is money to be made out of feeding women pills ) . They are now beginning to get answers on the problem caused by men : the underemployment of women and the discrimination that exists against them in every one of man 's institutions . ( She has always been his problem . He has always been hers . ) Underemployment and discrimination are costing him plenty of money . The wages he refuses to pay her for working he must now fork over in taxes to keep her out of the gutter and on the relief rolls . The billions he spends on giving her an equal education are wasted when she is not permitted to use her education . She is showing a tendency to become an alcoholic ( very expensive habit , for the nation ) . Her bills for psychiatric treatment and residence in mental institutions are mounting ; he has the money ; he has to pay them . Worst of all , his traditional attitude that he is superior and she inferior seems to be giving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his intimate relations with her as wife or lover are now driving him crazy . Altogether , his refusal to grant her equality is souring his business life , his home life-and his sex life : I Lis computers are also telling him that his automated , push-button , technological world , viewed as a vast machine , is quite ready to receive women operators at every level of manipulation . His political system , with its sacred credo of human equality , has always been ready , even though he has never-up to now-been willing , Today nothing stands between the creation of a Male-Female Establishment but man 's own prejudice-which , granted , is a tremendous barrier . It is not , however , impregnable . The sheer pressure of women , in ever increasing numbers , coming ( or being driven ) into man 's world is forcing them to rise in it . Heretofore , status has never been won by women ; it has always been granted to them by men . When women , especially working women , begin to recover from the shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , and that men do view them as primarily sex objects , they will make the old suffragettes look like Girl Scouts on a picnic . His computers are telling him that , for the first time in history , there is a real rallying of the Sister96 THE SRTURDAY EVENING POST January /February ' 74 hood that is being led by working women and their organizations . They will demand  --  and they will get  --  political , legal , and economic equality . They will then have won status . The equality of the sexes , despite this author 's somewhat gloomy reflections , is slowly coming about . It is bound to revolutionize all our institutions  --  including its most ancient one of marriage . When woman becomes the equal of man , she will get married , and he will get married , and they will stay married for one reason only  --  love .
