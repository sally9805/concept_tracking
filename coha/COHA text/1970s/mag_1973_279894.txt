THE Nixon Administration has developed a new language-a kind of Nix-speak . Government officials are entitled to make flat statements one day , and the next day reverse field with the simple phrase , " I misspoke myself . " White House Press Secretary Ronald Ziegler enlarged the vocabulary last week , declaring that all of Nixon 's previous statements on Watergate were " inoperative . " Not incorrect , not misinformed , not untrue-simply inoperative , like batteries gone dead . Euphemisms notwithstanding , the Nixon Administration 's verbal record on Watergate is enough to turn ardent believers into skeptics . Some examples of " inoperative " statements from Administration officials who misspoke themselves : <P> &gt; On June 19 , 1972 , only two days after the breakin , Ziegler refused to comment on the incident and called it a " third-rate burglary attempt , " adding , " This is something that should not fall into the political process . " <P> &gt; On Aug. 28 , Attorney General Richard Kleindienst pledged that the Justice Department 's investigation of the Watergate case would be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassination of President Kennedy . . . No credible , fair-minded person is going to be able to say that we whitewashed or dragged our feet on it . " In fact , five months later only seven men had been brought to trial as a result of that investigation-the five directly involved in the break-in on June 17 , plus a low-level White House consultant and a former White House staffer . Until recently , top officials in the Justice Department made little attempt to find out who had planned and approved the operation . <P> &gt; On Aug. 29 , President Nixon remarked of a Watergate investigation being conducted by his counsel , John W. Dean III : " I can say categorically that his investigation indicates that no one in the White House staff , no one in this Administration , presently employed , was involved in this very bizarre incident . " <P> &gt; On Oct. 16 , Clark MacGregor , then chief of the Committee for the Re-Election of the President , said : " Using innuendo , third-person hearsay , unsubstantiated charges , anonymous sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to give the appearance of a direct connection between the White House and the Watergate , a charge which the Post knows-and a half a dozen investigations have found-to be false . " <P> &gt; On Oct. 19 , Jeb Stuart Magruder , former deputy director of C.R.P. , told TIME Correspondent Hays Gorey : " Listen , when this is all over , you 'll know that there were only seven people who knew about the Watergate , and they are the seven who were indicted by the grand jury . " <P> &gt; On March 24 , 1973 , Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott quoted Nixon as saying : " I have nothing to hide . The White House has nothing to hide . I repeat , we have nothing to hide , and you are authorized to make that statement in my name . " <P> &gt; On March 26 , Ziegler " flatly " denied " any prior knowledge on the part of Mr. Dean regarding Watergate . "                  @ @ @
