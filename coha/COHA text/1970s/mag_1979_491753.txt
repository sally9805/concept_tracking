ADVENTURES OF THE MIND Belief Beyond Reason By MALCOLM MUGGER IDGE In trying to formulate what I believe , I have to begin with what I disbelieve . I disbelieve in progress , the pursuit of happiness , and all the concomitant notions and projects for creating a society in which human beings find ever greater contentment by being given in ever greater abundance the means to satisfy their material and bodily hopes and desires . In other words , I consider that the way of life in urbanized , rich countries as it exists today , and as it is likely to go on developing , is probably the most degraded and unillumined ever to come to pass on earth . The half-century in which I have been consciously alive seems to me to have been quite exceptionally destructive , murderous , and brutal . More people have been killed and terrorized , more driven from their homes and native places , more of the past 's heritage has been destroyed , more lies propagated and base persuasion engaged in , with less compensatory achievement in art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any comparableperiod in the recorded history of mankind . Ever since I can remember , the image of earthly power , whether in the guise of schoolmaster , mayor , judge , prime minister , monarch , or any other , has seemed to me derisory . I was enchanted when I first read in the Pensies ( Pascal being one of the small , sublime band of fellow humans to whom one may turn and say in the deepest humility : " 1 agree " ) about how magistrates and rulers had to be garbed in their ridiculous ceremonial robes , crowns , and diadems . Otherwise , who would not see through their threadbare pretensions ? I am conscious of having been ruled by buffoons , taught by idiots , preached at by hypocrites , and preyed upon by charlatans in the guise of advertisers and other professional persuaders , as well as by demagogues and ideologues of many opinions , all false . Nor , as far as I am concerned , is there any recompense in the so-called achievements of science . It is true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the composition and mechanism of the material universe than previously in the whole of recorded time . This does not at all excite my mind , or even my curiosity . The atom has been split ; the universe has been discovered and will soon be explored . Neither achievement has any bearing on what alone interests me  --  why life exists , and what is the significance , if any , of my minute and so transitory part in it . All the world in a single grain of sand ; all the universe , too . If I could understand a grain of sand , I should understand everything . Why , then , should going to the moon and Mars , or spending a holiday along the Milky Way , be expected to advance me any further in my quest than simply going to Manchester and Liverpool , or spending a holiday in Brighton ? Education , the great mumbo jumbo and fraud of the age , purports to equip us to live and is prescribed as a universal remedy for everything , from juvenile delinquency to premature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enlarge stupidity , inflate conceit , enhance credulity , and put those subjected to it at the mercy of brainwashers with printing presses , radio , and television at their disposal . I have seen pictures of huge , ungainly , prehistoric monsters who developed such a weight of protective shell that they sank under its burden and became extinct . Our civilization likewise is sinking under the burden of its own wealth and the necessity to consume it ; of its own happiness and the necessity to provide and sustain the fantasies that embody it ; of its own security and the ever more fabulously destructive nuclear devices considered essential to it . Thus burdened , it , too , may well soon become extinct . As this fact sinks more deeply into the collective consciousness , the resort to drugs , dreams , fantasies , and other escapist devices , particularly sex , becomes even more marked . Living thus in the twilight of a spent civilization , amidst its ludicrous and frightening shadows , what is there to believe ? Curiously enough , these twilight circumstances provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the purpose that lies behind them stands out with particular clarity . As human love only shines in all its glorious splendor when the last tiny glimmer of desire has been extinguished , so we have to make the world a wilderness to find God in it . The meaning of the universe lies beyond history , just as love lies beyond desire . That meaning shines forth in moments of illumination ( which come and go so unaccountably ; though , I am thankful to say , never quite ceasing  --  a sound as of music , far , far away , and drowned by other , more tumultuous noises , but still to be faintly and fitfully heard ) with an inconceivable clarity and luminosity . It breaks like a crystalline dawn out of darkness , and the deeper the darkness the more crystalline the dawn . Let me express it , as I have often thought of it , in terms of a stage . In the middle is the workaday world where we live our daily lives , earning a living , reading newspapers , exchanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I call this the Cafe Limbo . On the left of the stage is an area of darkness , within which shapes and movements can be faintly discerned and inconclusive noises heard ; sounds and sweet airs that , as on Caliban 's island , give delight and hurt not . I call this Life . The right of the stage is bright with arc lamps , like a television studio . This is where history is unfolded and news is made ; this is where we live our public , collective lives , seat and unseat rulers , declare wars and negotiate peace , glow with patriotism and get carried away with revolutionary zeal , enact laws , declaim rhetoric , swear eternal passion , and sink into abysses of desolation . I call this the Legend . Across this triple stage , between Life , the Cafe Limbo , and the Legend , a drama is endlessly presented . Two forces shape the play : the Imagination , which belongs to Life , and the Will , which belongs to the Legend . Out of the Imagination come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthesis ever grasped or to be grasped . Out of the Will come lust , hatred , cupidity , adulation , power , oratory ; every false antithesis ever propounded or to be propounded . Those who belong exclusively or predominantly to Life are saints , mystics , and artists . In extreme cases  --  Christ , for instance  --  they have to be killed . ( This is superbly explained in the famous Grand Inquisitor passage in The Brothers Karamazov , Dostoyevsky being , like Pascal , of the small , sublime band . ) Those who belong exclusively or predominantly to the Legend are power-maniacs , rulers , heroes , demagogues , and liberators . In extreme cases  --  Hitler , for instance  --  they bring about their own destruction . In Life there is suffering , deprivation , and sanity ; in the Legend , happiness , abundance , and madness . Most of us spend the greater part of our time in the Cafe Limbo , casting an occasional glance in the direction of Life , and more than an occasional one in the direction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar to provide a fillip as and when required . The Cafe Limbo is licensed . When a character passes from the Legend into Life , he brings some of the light with him , shining like a glowworm , until gradually the light subsides and goes out , swallowed up in the darkness of Life . T his same pattern may be traced more particularly and tragically in a single countenance , as anyone will be aware who has had occasion to watch over a loved face hovering between sanity and madness . ( And many have ; for as we abolish the ills and pains of the flesh we multiply those of the mind . By the time men are finally delivered from disease and decay  --  all pasteurized , their genes counted and rearranged , fitted with new , replaceable , plastic orBans , able to eat , copulate , and perform other physical functions innocuously and hygienically as and when desired  --  they will all be mad , and the world one huge psychiatric ward . ) You study the loved , distracted face as a scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its incomprehensibility . What you see is a fight to the death between the Will and the Imagination . If the former wins , then the flickering light will be put out forever ; if the latter does , it will shine again , to burn with a steady radiance , and you can cry out from a full heart : " Oh , beloved , you have come back to me . " I am well aware that , psychiatrically speaking , this is nonsensical . Yet I believe it . I see these two forces struggling for mastery in each individual soul ; in mine , in all men 's ; in each collectivity , throughout our earth and throughout the immeasurable universe . One is of darkness and one of light ; one wants to drag us down into the dark trough to rut and gorge there , and the other to raise us up into the azure sky , beyond appetite , where love is all-embracing , all-encompassing , and the dark confusion of life sorts itself out , like an orderly , smiling countryside suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun 's light and warmth . One is the devil and the other God . I have known both , and I believe in both . For us Western Europeans , the Christian religion has expressed this ancient and , as I consider , obvious dichotomy in terms of breath-taking simplicity and sublimity . It was not the first word on the subject , nor will it be the last ; but it is still our word . I accept it . I believe , as is written in the New Testament : If we would save our lives we must lose them ; we can not live by bread alone ; we must die in the flesh to be reborn in the spirit ; the flesh lusts contrary to the spirit and the spirit contrary to the flesh ; God can not see a sparrow fall to the ground without concern and has counted the hairs of each head , so that all that lives deserves our respect and reverence , and no one man can conceivably be more important , of greater significance , or in any way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Father , we are His children , and so one family , brothers and sisters together . It is true that these basic propositions of Christianity have got cluttered up with dogma of various kinds that I find often incomprehensible , irrelevant , and even repugnant . All the same , I should be proud and happy to be able to call myself a Christian ; to dare to measure myself against that sublimely high standard of human values and human behavior . In this I take comfort from another saying of Pascal , thrown out like a lifeline to all skeptical minds throughout the ages : Whoever looks for God has found Him . At its most obscurantist and debased , the Christian position still seems to me preferable to any scientific-materialist one , however cogent and enlightened . The evangelist with his lurid tract calling upon me to repent , for the Day of Judgment is at hand , is a burning and shining light corn-pared with the eugenist who claims the right to decide in his broiler-house mind which lives should be protracted and which must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so complacently and self-righteously display their assortment of contraceptives to the so-called " backward " peoples of the world as our civilization 's noblest achievement and most precious gift . The absurdities of the kingdom of heaven , as conceived in the minds of simple believers , are obvious enough  --  pearly gates , angelic choirs , golden crowns , and shining raiment . But what are we to think of the sheer imbecility of the kingdom of heaven on earth , as envisaged and recommended by the most authoritative and powerful voices of our time ? Wealth increasing forevermore , and its beneficiaries , rich in time-payment merchandise , stupefied with television and with sex , comprehensively educated , told by Professor Hoyle how the world began and by Bertrand Russell how it will end ; venturing forth on the broad highways , three lanes a side , with lay-bys to rest in and birth pills to keep them intacta , if not virgo , blood spattering the Tarmac as an extra thrill ; heaven lying about them in the supermarket , the rainbow ending in the nearest bingo hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming spires into the sky ; happiness in as many colors as there are pills  --  green and yellow and blue and red and shining white ; many mansions , mansions of light and chromium , climbing ever upward . This kingdom , surely , can only be for posterity an unending source of wry derision  --  always assuming there is to be any posterity . The backdrop , after all , is the mushroom cloud ; as the Gadarene herd frisk and frolic , they draw ever nearer to the edge of the precipice . As I do not believe that earthly life can bring any lasting satisfaction , the prospect of death holds no terrors . Those saints who pronounced themselves in love with death displayed , I consider , the best of sense , not a Freudian death wish . The world that I shall soon be leaving seems more than ever beautiful ; especially its remoter parts , grass and trees and sea and rivers and little streams and sloping hills , where the image of eternity is more clearly stamped than among streets and houses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have nothing to ask of them but their love ; the passion to accumulate possessions , or to be noticed and important , is too evidently absurd to be any longer entertained . A sense of how extraordinarily happy I have been , and of enormous gratitude to my Creator , overwhelms me often . I believe with a passionate , unshakable conviction that in all circumstances and at all times life is a blessed gift ; that the spirit that animates it is one of love , not hate or indifference , of light , not darkness , of creativity , not destruction , of order , not chaos . Since all life  --  men , creatures , plants , as well as insensate matter  --  and all that is known about it , now and henceforth , has been benevolently , not malevolently , conceived , when the eyes see no more and the mind thinks no more , and this hand now writing is inert , I believe that whatever lies beyond will similarly be benevolently , not malevolently or indifferently , conceived . If it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another mode of existence , with this worn-out husk of a body left behind , like a butterfly extricating itself from a chrysalis , and this floundering , muddled mind , now at best seeing through a glass darkly , given longer range and new precision , then for that likewise I offer thanks .
