' Mr Gardner " envisioned a pact in which the sovereignties of both the developing , and the rich countries were limited to protect the sovereignty of all . " We need to strike a great transcontinental . bargain in which access to energy and other raw materials , : which industrialized , countries need , is traded for other kinds- of access that developing countries need , " Mr. Gardner said . The requirements of the developing countries are access to markets at stable and remunerative prices ; access to technology , management skills and investment capital ; and access to a fairer share of decision-making in international institutions . Mr. Gardner said that the " world survival bargain " must balance assurances ' by rich countries to conserve energy , food , and raw materials with // commitments by poor countries to change some " suicidal " demographic , agricultural and environmental practices .
