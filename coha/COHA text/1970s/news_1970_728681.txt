txt A venture in black capitalism by two civil rights leaders who started out with a large inventory of idealism but a short supply of business experience has ended in rancor , distrust and a growing concern about the antiwhite feeling that has emerged among Southern blacks . The failure of the experiment in forging black economic strength through the help of white capital left both men ? one white and one black  --  with grave reservations about the future of black capitalism . Moreover , it demonstrated the rapid emergence of hostility toward whites among some Southern blacks who in the past had welcomed white liberals into the community as partners in social progress . Both of those points were conceded by Julian Bond , the 30-year-old black legislator who is one of the principal partners in a string of food stands that opened last year in Atlanta 's black community . The chain , which was widely advertised as black-owned and black-controlled , was intended to be a training school for young Negro managers who were to share in the profits of the business and eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , mismanagement and other troubles ran the business into debt , and last month a group of dismissed employes and students from Morehouse College threw up a picket line and accused Mr. Bond of being a tool of white business interests . But the heart of the trouble was the disclosure that the individual who had signed $100 , - 000 worth of notes to finance the business was a white man , Dr. Gerald Reed of Atlanta , a long-time liberal and the only member of his race named to the executive board of the Atlanta chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People . Mr. Bond and Dr. Reed contended that the allegations were untrue , that neither had profited in any way from the business and that , indeed , both had risked substantial sums of their own money to provide the nucleus of black ownership in the community . But the pressure created by the pickets and the support of black militants grew , and Dr. Reed finally turned over his minority share of the stock in the enterprise without payment . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The developments left Dr. Reed angry and shaken . He criticized the moderate black leadership in the community for not standing up for him when the militants described him as a " filthy white racist , sucking blood out of the black community . " " Julian and I were both a couple of noble jerks , " he said in a recent interview . " We had pledged the profits to put black people in business . Neither Julian nor I need the income that would be derived from the source . " Sought to Set Example The 45-year-old dentist , who has a private practice in a white neighborhood , traced his involvement in the black community to the early days of the civil rights movement , when he was one of the few whites who joined with Negroes in attempts to desegregate lunch counters and water fountains . He said that it was he who presented the outline for the plan of Operation Breadbasket , a black economic venture , to the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . " Julian and I saw ourselves as setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that others might follow and provide a way for the black community to control business for a change , " he said , a point supported by Mr. Bond . -A 28-year-old black Vietnam veteran named Hank Thomas , a former field secretary for the Congress of Racial Equality who had owned several laundromats in Atlanta , was introduced to Dr. Reed by Mr. Bond . The three formed two corporations in early 1969 , with Mr. Thomas serving as chairman of the board and president . and Mr. Bond serving as vice president of both enterprises . In the first corporation , the men explained , Mr. Thomas and Dr. Reed each controlled 471 , shares of stock ; Mr. Bond held the remaining five shares . No Dividend Declared In the second corporation , the three principals each owned one-third of the shares , they said . Because the enterprise failed to show a profit in the first year of operation , no dividend was ever declared , the partners said . Mr. Thomas was the only partner to draw a salary , which started off at $300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt mounted this spring . The debt included a $17,000 tax lien by the Internal Revenue Service . High Rate of Robberies What became of the income after the regular payment of mortgages and other notes is unclear . Neither Dr. Reed nor , Mr. Bond was certain about the amount of gross income in the first year of operation , although they placed it in the vicinity of $600,000 . Both men said that instead of taking profits they were forced to invest several thousand dollars more in the business during the year . " Somehow the business got into incredibly bad financial straits because none of us had a clear over-all picture of what was coming in and what was being paid out , " Mr. Bond declared . " The blame falls on me . I simply put my money , in a business and let it go . " The partners also said there were 20 robberies at the stores in the first year , an abnormally high rate . " The black community destroys its own , " Dr. Reed offered by way of an explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a better break from a white judge if he steals from a black business . " He also asserted that bad bookkeeping by untrained employes , mismanagement and internal thievery had led to the disappearance of other sums . When five store managers and supervisors were dismissed last month , they began spreading rumors in the community that Dr. Reed was secretly banking all the profits from the business . Part of the ensuing wrath appeared to be caused by the radio commercials and handbills that left the impression that the business was entirely black-owned . When an explanation was made of Dr. Reed 's role , the black community , conditioned by years of white economic exploitation , refused to accept it as an act of altruism , and their suspicions mounted when few black leaders besides Mr. Bond spoke out in the dentist 's defense . " No one could accept the fact that Julian or I did this for noble purposes , " continued Dr. Reed . He said that many black leaders had telephoned him to express their regret about the assaults on his character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They are intimidated , " he said . " I want them to have the guts I had when I spoke out in the white community 15 years ago . " Mr. Bond was equally somber . " Any business needs capital and there 's not much or it available in the black community , " he said . " Wealthy blacks in Atlanta are not known for their daring . They 've made it and they want to hold onto it . I 'm against having white businesses in the black community , but this the reaction against Dr. Reed will mean a black ca n't get any white help . Whites with capital to invest will be wary . " " When Gerry and I started ' out in this I did n't think we had anything to risk , " he continued . " We had the mistaken idea that we were performing a service in providing 80 jobs . Now I 've been attacked personally and I did n't think my record needed to be defended . If we go down I would have lost an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost 18 months of his life . And Gerry my have lost his home , his dental practice and his car . There 's no necessity to say Gerry Reed is a good guy . He can stand on his record . After all , he could have just been a plain dentist and stayed at home . "
