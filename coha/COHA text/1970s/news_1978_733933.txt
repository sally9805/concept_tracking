txt This once-thriving industrial city moved to the brink of fiscal default today . City officials failed to reach a consensus on how to pay off $15.5 million in short-term loans due by the close of business tomorrow , and a major lender notified the city late today of its objections to the Mayor 's proposals to prevent default . The Cleveland Trust Company , which holds some $5 million of the loans due tomorrow , advised the city by letter that it did not agree with Mayor Dennis S. Kucinich 's plan . " We still feel , " the letter said , " that the plan is too reliant on speculative contingencies which are beyond the control of the city administration . " ? The trust company 's action increased the prospects of the city 's not being able to renew at least a portion of its loans , even if there were a consensus on a rescue plan , as it has been widely reported here that the banks are operating under a gentlemen 's agreement to stick together . But agreement on a means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 33-member Cleveland City Council failed to materialize , and Mayor Kucinich and City Council President George L. Forbes . both Democrats , remain sharply divided over the Mayor 's proposals . ? The Mayor 's plan , embraced by most of the bankers whose loans are coming due , closely resembles the fiscal reorganization plan used several years ago to save Yonkers from fiscal disaster . It has four basic points and a number of ifs , ands and buts that drew fire ' from some council members when it was outlined to them yesterday . Mayor Kucinich and his fiscal advisers have called for the council to approve two measures of the so-called " pre-default " plan by tomorrow , and the lenders have said that approval is a must if they are to consider renewing the loans . Tax Revenue as Security One of the two measures would authorize a referendum in February on raising the city income tax from I cent to 11/2 Cents on the dollar . The other would pledge receipts from the city income tax as security on the renewed loans . The Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal problems , proposals that do not face a Friday deadline , include a $90 million bond issue . He wants the council to authorize the bond issue to pay off $40 million in short-term notes that are due next year as well as to refund $52 million that was raised in previous bond issues for capital programs but was used to cover general operating expenses of the city . The plan has been characterized by some as political suicide for the 32-yearold Mayor , who campaigned on a platform of no new taxes , and some council members have said it is stronger medicine than the feared default . Effect Would Be Long-Range Default would have very little immediate impact on the day-to-day activities of the city . However , the long-term impact could be severe since numerous sources of credit could dry up and lenders could harden their demands , making it extremely difficult for the city to provide such basic services as police and fire protection , street maintenance and garbage collection to its 600,000 residents . The jockeying at City Hall in the past several days has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides ? has overshadowed the fear of fiscal collapse . The mostly Democratic City Council has been at odds with Mr. Kucinich and his " urban populism " for months , exhibiting its dissatisfaction with what amounts to a block vote of 28 to 5 against his major proposals . Mr. Kucinich responds to the council by vetoing measures it passes . The council reacts by overriding the vetoes . Power Company Is Central Issue The crux of their difficulties with each other is the controversial , Municipal Electric Light Plant , a dilapidated city-owned power distribution facility that provides electric power to about 20 percent of the city 's residents . The City Council wants the plant sold in accordance with its 1977 ordinance , and some council critics of the Mayor 's fiscal rescue program suggested yesterday that he Mayor might win their votes if he would simplysell Muny Light . But Mr. Kucinich , who campaigned on a pledge to save the plant " for the people , " is risking default to prove his point . The Mayor 's career might be finished , political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Kucinich does not stand firm , if he bows to the council 's wishes on Muny Light , it would almost certainly finish him , they say , particularly after his turnaround on taxes . Mr. Kucinich asserts that by keeping Muny Light the city is able to hold the electric bills for some 20 percent of its residents below the rate paid by the other 80 . percent , who purchase their power from the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company , the private utility . Antitrust Suit Filed Several years ago a ruling from the old Federal Power Commission sustained the city 's claim that the private utility had engaged in business activities that appeared to be in violation of Federal antitrust laws and in so doing had infringed upon the abilities of the public power company to serve the city . The result was that the city filed a $333-million antitrust suit against the private utility , a suit that has national implications and that gained the support of the Justice Department this year in a friendof-the-court brief . Winning the suit would be a sweet victory for Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seasoned politican , is among those who want to get rid of Muny Light . In fact , he insists upon it . He said yesterday that he would not vote for the Mayor 's fiscal proposals unless the Mayor agreed to its sale , and Mr. Forbes 's approval is considered a must if the fiscal plan is to carry . The proponents of selling Muny Light argued that it no longer serves the good of the public , since it buys its power from the private utility rather than generating it and since it has back debts to the utility that amounted to some $18 million a year ago . The private power company has already gotten a court order attaching some city property because of the debt . Funds Said to Be Needed Elsewhere Further , they say , funds used to pay the Muny Light debt could be used for other badly needed services and programs . There is a buyer for the city 's power plant : the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company . Last year it proposed to take Muny Light off the city 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be paid over a 30-year period . It proposed to as . sumo the debt of Muny Light , hut the city , in return , would have to agree to drop its antitrust suit . Mr. Kuchinich politely informed the council members yesterday , that despite their demands , the sale . of Muny Light " was nut one of the bargaining chips " in his negotiations for a fiscal rescue plan . As the hours ticked away , neither side budged , and the fight over the city 's fiscal rescue headed into the final round .
