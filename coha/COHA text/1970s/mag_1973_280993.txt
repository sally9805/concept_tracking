O'NEILL : SON AND ARTIST <P> by LOUIS SHEAFFER 750 pages . Little , Brown . $15 . <P> Eugene O'Neill seemed to write as if God ( or the Devil ) had given him life for just one reason : to shout with every breath that all was a ghastly mistake . " Froth ! Rotten ! " were his actor father 's dying lines , and the playwright son with the eyes of a fallen angel carried on the refrain . " The Great Sickness " was among O'Neill 's milder epithets for human existence . <P> What an extraordinary record O'Neill compiled for a life hater ! The second and final volume of Louis Sheaffer 's fair-minded biography picks him up , 31 and ascendant , at his Broadway debut with Beyond the Horizon , which won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1920 . Between 1920 and 1922 he turned out eight plays . He wrote The Emperor Jones in about two weeks , The Hairy Ape in 2 and Ah ! Wilderness in less than a month . <P> A dutiful pessimist , O'Neill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts . But his labors for the New York stage brought him four Pulitzers and a Nobel Prize ( in 1936-for Mourning Becomes Electro , O'Neill thought ) . Strange Interlude netted O'Neill , who was not immune to the charms of money , about $275,000 . He inhabited at least three artist 's dream palaces , including a 35-room chateau at Le Plessis near Tours . In his closet O'Neill had 75 pairs of shoes ; in his drive , a Bugatti roadster . What more could even a black Irishman ask for ? <P> Lots , as it turned out . Almost perversely , O'Neill forced his life to come out as tragically as his scripts by specializing in family disasters . O'Neill families resembled his literary influences : plots by Ibsen , wives by Strindberg . In his 40th year he left Agnes Boulton ( mother of Shane and Oona O'Neill ) , a short-story writer who once fell asleep while he was reading a script to her . His third and last wife never made that mistake . Born Hazel Tharsing , Carlotta Monterey met her fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes , " like wet grapes , " fixed on him , she blessed and cursed the playwright with all the attention a writer could dream of . <P> " Real Love . " Carlotta played mistress ( a little ) , mother ( a lot ) , as well as efficient housekeeper and secretary . She intercepted O'Neill 's mail , censored his clippings , and jealously screened his friends-especially women . Half a dozen innocent conversations with O'Neill put a very young actress named Patricia Neal on Carlotta 's enemy list . Years later , when Miss Neal , then a star , was about to be signed for a revival of Desire Under the Elms , Carlotta vetoed the casting . Yet by her fanatical possessiveness Carlotta gave O'Neill both the protection he needed as a practicing artist and the pain he needed as a practicing masochist-which may be better than he gave in return .
