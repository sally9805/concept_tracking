RUMMAGE AND LOSS A story by David Black T HE ONLY TIME I MET my father 's father was on a trip to Providence , Rhode Island , in the fall of 1953 . I was eight . To celebrate our visit , my grandmother planned to butcher a chicken . My mother , afraid the slaughter ' would terrify me , sent me from the kitchen . Having recently read the story of Abraham and Isaac in a Saturday morning Bible class , I conjured up an exotic murder to fit the noises which I heard behind the shut doorflutterings , wing  --  whirrings. , shouts , the crash of glass ( while swinging the bird over her head to break its neck , my grandmother slammed a pitcher from a shelf ) . " What 's that ? " asked my father as he wiped his glasses on a crocheted antimacassar . " She 's got a live chicken in there , " I said . Hannah ran to peek . She returned , reaching up behind her head to unsnap her terrier-shaped barrette , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was a hideous scream in the kitchen . Hannah and I both looked at my father , who had plunged into a Russian grammar book he had brought and now sat , staring at the piano , making the alien sounds of soft Ls and palatal Rs . I sneaked across the dining room and , opening the door a crack , peered into the kitchen . My mother was kneeling under the window , sweeping glass shards into a dustpan , her back to me . My grandmother , her hair wrapped in a turquoise babushka , humming Brahms 's Lullaby , stood at the table , smoothing the dead chicken 's feathers . I wandered back to the living room and , having tucked myself into a corner of the sofa , picked up the Providence Journal 's Sunday comic supplement , in which I discovered " The Little King , " " The Katzenjammer Kids , " and " Henry . " Our Springfield Republican comics , which offered the denser adult worlds of " Terry and the Pirates , " " Steve Canyon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomy . My father , pausing between Lesson T , and Lesson Four , asked , " Did I tell you a the time my father went after me with a bt er 's knife ? " " I do n't think I want to meet him , " Hannah . When he arrived in a taxi , we gathere the front porch to greet him . Pondero moving his buttocks in a semicircle , he ba from the cab . Facing away from us , he stra ened up , tugged at the flukes of his to jacket , and , spreading his arms , he tunic place . " Moses ! " he cried , " Ethel ! " He luml across the walk and stomped up the step arms still spread , as though he were ph airplane . " Aaron , " said my grandmother , " what you done ?

He kissed nah 's hand . Her eyes widened ; and , le she clasped the spot his lips had touehed. ; a flourish , he bowed to my mother , scowled over his bent head . He shook b : my father 's hands , folding them togeth tween his big palms . Before his wit paused . " Pauline , " he said , repeatedly noddi told you they 'd finally come .

" grandmother , who had stopped in the m doorway and was folding a checkered awel , said , " What I remember about you was when I came by your house and saw you standing in the middle of the room , carrying your dead brother , Saul , in your arms . You looked so surprised . Saul died of smallpox , " she explained , " and Aaron just stood there , holding him and looking puzzled . " When he was eighteen , my grandfather walked from Plissa to Berlin , where , upon arriving , he asked directions to a particular address . " The man said , ' Run down this street and run up that street , ' " my grandfather said . " In German the word meant walk , but in Yiddish it meant run . So I followed his directions and ran even though it seemed pretty strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted , " was when you first came to America . You and Frank took dancing lessons . " My grandfather , prepared for the story , winked at me , forming a conspiracy , as though only the two of us could appreciate the anecdote . " There they were , " my grandmother continued , " him , " she pointed at my grandfather , " six foot three , and my brother , Frank , four foot four , hanging on to each other and waltzing , waltzing together whenever they had the chance . I used to laugh so hard . " Hannah , excluded by my grandfather 's wink , laughed loudly to prove she understood the joke . " But , Pauline , " said my grandfather , gently suggesting that my grandmother had missed the point of her own tale , " I was a good dancer . That 's why you married me , " " That 's why Esther married you , " said my grandmother . Esther Chodis , my grandfather 's first wife , had been my grandmother 's friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother , " I was the brains . When she found out that Aaron liked Zola , she had me read Germinal and tell her the plot , so she could impress him . When we lived in New York , we were roommates , and I had to console her over her love affair with Aaron . " " I was a gentleman , " said my grandfather . Gallantly , he wooed and won his cunning Esther by three-stepping into her cagey heart . " She wanted me to sell dresses , " said my grandfather , who in 1909 had slouched around Manhattan looking for a job as a journalist on an American newspaper . He had learned English by struggling through The Leather-stocking Tales and a carton of brittle , yellowed copies of Ned Buntline , which he found abandoned in their apartment closet the day they moved in . At night , Esther sewed sample dresses for a designer named William Punch . while my grandfather paced through the two " My grandfather , prepared for the story , winked at me , forming a conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anecdote . " rooms , bellowing out passages about Wild Bill Hickok or Wyatt Earp . " I wanted to go to San Francisco and Denver , " said my grandfather , " she wanted to go to Paris . " Through a friend who worked on the sports section of the New York Post , my grandfather met William Barclay Masterson . They got drunk at a sportswriters ' bar on Tenth Street and waffled on until three in the morning about Indians , street brawls , gunfights , and boxing . " Mostly about boxing . " said my grandfather , " but other things too . You know , once when he was lost in the desert , my friend , Bat Masterson , had to drink his own blood to survive . He dared me to do the same . He had a silver knife with his initials on it , and he said he 'd give it to me if I 'd open a vein and drink my own blood . " He rolled back his sleeve and showed me a white crescent on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch did n't let me keep the knife . " Mr. Punch , Esther 's boss , offered to take her with him to Europe . Tempted , but demure , she said , Not without my husband " but she smiled ambiguously . Mr. Punch offered my grandfather a chance to revisit his family in Plissa . They packed , sent their children  --  my father and his brother  --  to Pauline , who had moved to Providence , and sailed in the spring of 1913 to a continent which welcomed them with headlines announcing the Treaty of London . My grandfather , after an angry week in Paris , left Esther to her nimble fancy , which bopped back and forth between her husband and her employer . He arrived in Providence , denouncing marriage , swaggeringly defending a new order in which both sex and politics were free of ethical subtlety . Pauline warily agreed that marriages might founder and , since she already had his two children , let him move in . Within a year , they married . He spent the first world war selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beets , and potatoes . Unable to support his family , he sent my father and my uncle to the Mount Sinai Orphanage in Boston , moved with Pauline into a one-room apartment , and began to plot . In 1921 , determined to make a fortune in bootleg liquor , he abandoned his grocery pushcart and went to work as a driver for racketeers . On a fall day in 1922 , he left a warehouse in a truck carrying $30,000 worth of booze , and , driving to New York City , he sold the stuff on his own . After ditching the truck in Brooklyn , he sent $15,000 to Pauline and advised her not to touch the money for five years and the buy a house , which she did . Pocketing other half of his sudden wealth , he fie , France .

T HE FIRST NIGHT of our visit t grandparents ' house , I stayed a listening to the angry sounds downstairs : the murmur , getting er and louder , the hiss as everyone sli each other , the belligerent murmurs aga : The window was open . I smelled o burning leaves . The few ears that passed motors revving , slowing as gears were eh revving again farther off and quieter , filled the silences from downstairs . I on a poppy seed that was wedged pa between two back teeth . My mouth garbagey from the cabbage we 'd ht. dinner . When my sister 's bed creaked , I " What do you think they 're fighting al She mumbled something jammed wi vowels and then , sitting bolt up , said , ' sleep .

It left me with the feeling of ping my head into a sinkful of icy water , cold cap that clasps the skull , the ache in mysterious region which could be behind eyes or at the base of the jaw . dreamed of wolves and death rays and my ndfather , looking like Homer , swooping the porch steps , his arms spread into bat gs . r HE SONG OF THE PLAINS , " sung by the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from bed and went barefoot to investigate . In the next room , father was honking in his sleep . His white t lay in the doorway like a stiff pudding . re were red ink spots above his pocket re his pen points had rubbed . From the of the hall , I heard my grandmother ck her lips as though she were tasting , ng her sleep . There was no carpet on the 7s , and the cold steps made my feet curl . i the kitchen , which smelled of linseed oil last night 's cabbage , my grandfather , his vn pants held up by suspenders that looped ? a bare , white , hairless chest , was squeezoranges in a juicer . When I walked in , he ghtened up and gesturing with a dripping said , " Tovarich. " aving wiped his hands on his thighs , he me into the living room to the old-fashd Victrola .

In the kitchen , my grandfather gave me oranges to slice . I handed him halves , which he squeezed with vicious twists of the wrist as he boomed along with the 78 : Madrid , your tears of sorrow , Madrid , your tears u f sorrow , Madrid , your tears of sorrow , mamita min , We shall avenge them . . . . The table was running with juice . I was sticky up to my elbows . When the record ended , my grandfather , wiping the backs of his hands on his rump ( with his elbows out , he looked as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . I heard him crank up the Victrola , change records . He strolled back into the kitchen , his lips compressed , punching the air on the heavy musical beats . We are the peat-bog sol-diers , Mar-thing with our spades .... " Drink , " said my grandfather , raising a glass . Strands of pulp clung to the rim . " To the Revolution . May it be short and bloody . " I grinned at his abrupt solemnity . " When I was your age , " he said , " the sacks burned down our synagogue . Have ever seen anything like that ? Stand up . me feel your muscle . " He pinched my upper arm until it hurt . " Flex . Flex . What 're you afraid of ? Hey , punch me in the gut . Go ahead . Punch me . " He raised his hands as though 1 were sticking him up . His belly heaved over the top of his pants , round as a globe , drum-tight . Hitting it was like belting a soccer ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions , raising my hands above my head , trying not to clench my fingers in fear . " Ready ? " he asked . " Yeah , " I said . I leaned back so my belly would bulge . He shook his head . " Not that way , " lie said , " Make your belly into a fist . " Holding my breath , squinting , I tensed my stomach muscles . My grandfather drew back his right arm  --  his hand palm up  --  and curled his fingers over . " On your mark , get set ... " His poke sent me sprawling into the pantry . I could n't breathe . I felt as if a rod were being forced down my throat . My saliva tasted of onions and chocolate . I was sitting in front of the stove . When I raised my head , I cracked my skull on the oven door handle . " You 're tough , " said my grandfather , " but you 've got to get tougher . If they think they 've hurt you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dangling by his legs , and he was buttoning on a red wool shirt . " Come on , " he said , " get up . " He lifted me with one hand and set me on wobbly feet . Shrugging on his suspenders , he strode across the kitchen . " I 'm going to put on ' Volga Boatmen , ' he said , wagging a raised forefinger at the ceiling . " Be dressed by the time it 's over . " HROCGH THE LOFTY DOORS , like temple doors , like doors of the courts of law , we strode , I proud of my grand- father , who wore a long leather vest and a bashed bowler , he proud of his grandson , who in an Ivy-League , button-down , Awhile , slightly blue shirt , was proof of his progeny 's secure Americanism . All around us hung the yellowish and blood-caked carcasses of cows . " You will eat , you will eat , by and by , " sang my grandfather grandly , in that glorious land in the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speared on a honk ; each hook hung loose between two metal rails ; the rails ran the length of the warehouse  --  a huge man in a blood-spattered apron embraced the suspended meat , swung it hack , and sent it sailing down the room . The ball that held the hook chattered in its track . A hundred feet away , another aproned giant caught the side of beef , swung it , sending it further down the room . The first man had grabbed another carcass and flung it on . One by one , the corpses rushed past us. " ... work and pray , live on hay , " my grandfather bellowed , " you 'll have pie in the sky when you die-ee-aye .... " " Hey , Aaron , " said a white-haired man with a scar that curled across his cheek and over his upper lip , " who 's the kid ? " " My grandson , " said my grandfather . " He 's a good boy , Max . " Max grabbed my band in his fist . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . " Butcher ! " my grandfather shouted . " Butcher ? He 's going to be a poet . " Max stood sideways and turned his head to look down at me over his shoulder . " Aw , " he said , " whaddaya want ? Waste a big kid like that on books ? " " Another Pushkin , " my grandfather boomed , the name exploding in his mo like a wind : " Pboosh-kin ! " Max , bending down , asked me , " You wai be a poet , hey ? " His sour breath smelled meat loaf and milk . " Aaron , I got someth to clear your brain . " Shuffling along the sawdust-covered Max lcd us to a small , glassed-in room . walls , partitions , extended only halfway to ceiling . The sweetish smell of blood and d flesh was stronger in the enclosed space . There was a desk , covered with tissue- : papers spilling out of manila folders , a cabinet , one side of which was painted a swivel chair and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around blades hung oddly forward ) , and a eardbc box , used as a wastebasket , filled with ball paper , crumpled Hershey wrappers , an girlie calendar from Anderson 's Garden broken milk bottle . Max yanked open a desk drawer , took a bottle of applejack and three dirty c ( cups , which he shook above the box . liquid dribbled onto the calendar pictur naked girl , sitting with her legs tucked u her and holding a basket of fresh fruit her lap . Because I had never before se. picture of a naked woman , I pulled it out " Let me wipe that off for you , " said I grabbing it . Unsure whether to let me it or , under some professional pretext rediscover its value and slip it into hidinj looked to my grandfather for a clue .

But I 'll tell you what ... " Because I was present , Max acknowledged the challenge he normally ignored . His sense of sly justice demanded that my grandfather for my sake had to make good his boast . At the door he called , " Reigel . Hey , Reigel , come here . " The first guy we had seen handling the meat turned and nodded , waved , loped toward us . Quietly , he shut the door and waited . He was as tall as my grandfather , as broad , and thirty years younger . Beads of sweat , like rivets , dotted the right side of his forehead . His eyes were clear blue . When he opened his mouth to pick between two teeth with a thumbnail , I saw a crimson palate . Max jerked his head toward my grandfather and said to Reigel , " Punch him in the belly . " " In the belly , " my grandfather repeated , pointing to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward any grandfather until he was an arm 's length away , dropped into a crouch , and , ducking his head professionally , swung . My grandfather winced , forced back his shoulders , squinted , and gasped . His mobile grimace kept trying to become a smile . He spoke in a tight voice : " Like a twenty-year-old . " He made jerky bows like a mechanical soldier with a sprung spring . He said , " We 've got to go . " Reigel asked , " That all ? " Max said , " Yeah . Thanks . " Reigel left , again carefully closing the door . " I 'll send the meat to the store , " said Max . " Fine , " said my grandfather , " fine , fine . " When my grandfather had opened the door , Max grabbed my elbow and handed me the bottle of applejack . " Give your grandpop a shot , " he said , " when he feels better . " I ran after my grandfather , who was striding quickly thlough the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got outside , he was leaning over the street , puking . He held his forehead with one hand , the back of his neck with the other . A strand of tan spittle hung from the corner of his mouth . When he pulled in his chin , the loose end of the strand swung over and attached itself to his vest . I sat on the curb a few feet away , holding the bottle on my left knee . He wiped his lips with his sleeve . " Let 's take a walk , " he said . As we wandered through the streets , whistled a few notes , belched , patted his bel I trotted beside him , carrying the bottle by neck as though it were a bell . On a pier , stopped , stretched his arms above his he , and asked , " Do you want to rest ? " " I 'm not tired , " I said . He scowled : " I am .

" He took the bottle from me and , a wiping the top with his palm , said , " To Revolution . " I agreed : " To the Revolution . " He bowled with laughter . Standing up drank the rest of the liquor  --  I watched , cinated , as his Adam 's apple jiggled up down  --  and flung the empty bottle into water .

" My grandfather 's expression did not change . " Did you ? " my father asked . My grandfather thrust his hands into his pockets and jingled coins and keys . " Did you ? " asked my father , his voice rising . My grandfather looked sideways at the hassock beside the couch . " Answer me ! " my father shouted . " Will you please answer me ! " My grandfather did not answer . My father licked his lips , stood up , and after glancing around as though puzzled left the room and walked out onto the front porch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the window and shouted , " Sorry ! " My grandfather did not acknowledge him , so my father unfolded one of the porch chairs and sat down . Having leaned over to fix a disarrayed pant cuff or tie a shoe ( all I could see through the glass was the irregular curve of his hunched back ) , my father settled more comfortably in the afternoon chill . Without looking up , my grandfather said to me , " There 's an envelope inside the piano seat . " I lifted the top of the seat and found sheet music from a Cole Porter play , an empty but uncrushed Camel cigarette pack , two cloth BandAids , and a nine-by-twelve manila envelope , which I brought to my grandfather . He bent back the metal clasps and spilled out papers and photographs . After shuffling through the clutter on his lap , he slipped out a snapshot of a lanky , gawky man who was sitting on a grocery wagon and holding an infant in his arms . My grandfather studied the scene and said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on an outing . " And he shot a triumphant look through the window at my father , who sat turned away from us on the porch , mouthing Russian vowels . " They wanted answers that would not only calm their apprehension of the morning , but heal the breach between my father and his father . "
