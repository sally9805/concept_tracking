R. H. Tawney Richard Henry Tawney ( 1880-1962 ) belonged , as he wrote , to the " generation of illusion , " a generation which imbibed certain simple ideas of right in the years before 1914 when the imbibing of such ideas was still possible ; and throughout his long life he believed that all men should be assured the basic decencies which he had taken for granted as a middle class Englishman coming of age before the war , that they should have equal access to the richest possible culture , that the flowering of what was unique in them , their " personal quality , " should not be impeded by the accidental circumstances of their class or birth , and that a society which stopped short of guaranteeing men these things might be rich and prosperous , but had no claim to being called " civilized " ? Tawney 's irony was too profound to permit him to say " just . " Irony , indeed , was the note of everything he wrote . He had a lively sense of the ironic distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But unlike some moralists he did not believe in a change of heart ; man would always be a " child of Adam " ; it was his society which must change . It must assure all the children of Adam equal " life-chances " by establishing institutions which " stress lightly differences of wealth and birth and social position . . . and which meet common needs and are a source of common enlightenment and common is groping its way out of a deep slump . enjoyment . " These established , irony would still be in order ; humankind would be well short of Utopia . But it would at least have a social order based on principles " to which , if it chose , it could live up and not down . " Tawney inherited this generous faith from a more hopeful age , and he held to it in the face of the historical horrors of our age with an inspiring constancy . Not that he believed socialism was written in the historical stars ? he respected Marx , but scorned Marxism , " that servile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ' 30s that the only Utopia the facts of history seemed to portend was H. G. Wells 's nightmare of samurai and airmen . But history was not wholly a realm of fact ; it was , so Tawney believed , a realm of value as well . An appeal to principle was therefore the condition of any considerable social reconstruction ; " social institutions are the visible expression of the scale of moral values which rules the minds of individuals , and it is impossible to alter institutions without altering that moral valuation . " Acting in the light of right values ? he never doubted which these were ? men and women could make a better society . It was not socialism he put his faith in ; it was the power of belief . Tawney had the typical background of the English intellectual classes , of which E. M. Forster 's remark in Howard 's End , that " the independent means came in and the independent ideas went up , " is the memorable epitome . He was born in India , where his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rugby , then , in 1899 , to Oxford ? he was a disappointing Second at Balliol . " How do you propose to wipe out this disgrace ? " his father wrote . Unlike the men of his generation who may be counted his peers , however ? Forster , Russell , Moore , Strachey , Lowes Dickinson ? he did not embark on his intellectual career directly he got his degree . Instead he spent the next decade as a Tutor in the Workers ' Educational Association , giving evening classes to working men , from whose " friendly smitings " he was given a view of society undreamt of in the genteel philosophy of Oxford . Come the war in 1914 , he enlisted as a private , though as a " gentleman " he could easily have won a commission . After two years in the trenches he made sergeant , and while urging his men forward on the first day of the Somme was shot through the chest and abdomen : " I felt that I had been hit by a tremendous iron hammer swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in No Man 's Land for two days and nights , resigned to death : " When one 's half dead the extra plunge does not seem so very terrible . " After the war Tawney became one of the leading figures in the whole field of English adult education ; was made Reader at the London School of Economics ; was active in Fabian Society and Labour Party affairs ; even ran as a Labour candidate in three by-elections and , in his words , " was quite rightly rejected with enthusiasm in all of them . " In the early ' 30s he visited China ; Lund and Labor in China was the literary upshot ; it contains a prophetic passage : The revolution of 1911 was a bourgeois affair . The revolution of the peasants was still to come . If their rulers continue to exploit them , or to permit them to be exploited , as remorselessly as hitherto , it is likely to be unpleasant . it will not , perhaps , he undeserved . Prescient about China , Tawney was undeceived about the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the few Left intellectuals of the inter-war period of whom this can be said . He saw that the Soviets had introduced a new form of inequality and did n't let a metaphysical enthusiasm for the future stop him from saying so . Neither did Orwell : they had moral lucidity in common . Marriage ( to Jeanette Beveridge , like him an Anglo-Indian ) , domestic pleasures , visiting professorships , and service on countless committees , councils , commissions , a blaze of beneficence , round out his life . The author of The Acquisitive Society lived austerely , partly " because my life is that terrible thing an unplanned economy , " but partly from principle . He thought the taking of bibliography of his writings in Ross Terrill 's recent biography runs to nearly 30 pages . The 32 items under the heading " Prefaces and Short Introductions by Tawney " are eloquent on his generosity . Here is one source of his friends ' devotion . Tawney 's field of scholarly exertion was the economic and social history of England in the loth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrated dismissive judgment on modern academic life , " They make a darkness and call it research and are afraid of the glare of general ideas , " it should be pointed out that he was interested in the " dusty dialectics " of that past age of usury , rack-renting and enclosure less for themselves ? he was not , as C. R. Elton has charged , " historyminded " ? than for the light they threw on the nascency of a new type of society . As a writer Tawney 's command of the grand is unrivaled . He had a great feeling for the Elizabethans and an echo of their eloquence and gusto is the dominant note of his prose . Here is a sample from Relision and the Rise of Capitalism ; it is surely one of the noblest periods in the language : threat of famine , their pigmy forces against an implacable nature , was added the haunting insecurity at a graving , though still small . proletariat , detached from their narrow niche in village or borough , the sport of social forces which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . Whether this is your kind of thing or not , here , clearly , is a master of English prose . If what Tawney says is morally compelling , the way he says it is esthetically irresistible . His style , as Mr. Terrill says , makes Socialist values appealing . II . Tawney 's major books , The Acquisitive Society ( 19201 , Religion and the Rise of Capitalism ( 1926 ) , and Equality ( 1931 ) , bear intimately on one another ; he was remarkably steady in his interests . But The Acquisitive Society has the strongest claim on contemporary attention because the sickness which it diagnosed over half a century ago now threatens to be terminal . The propagating source of this sickness is the " false philosophy " which our civilization mistakes for light . Poverty , unemployment , the squalor of our cities , the waste of life in our schools , and , on the other hand , the production of costly futilities , the paying of preposterously high salaries to nonentities , and the carnival of greed on Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by-products ; they issue from the very nature of " a society whose whole tendency and interest and preoccupation is the acquisition of wealth , " an acquisitive society . Tawney can sound as futile and priggish as an English curate . But his main point survives these moralistic moments . For he is not saying that wealth is wrong but that in the acquisitive society its pursuit is unchecked by a social ethic . You must get yours , I must get mine , and we dare n't give quarter : it would be irrational market behavior . Neither is he saying that industrialism is wrong ? Tawney is no Luddite ? but that industry in the acquisitive society is not conducted with regard to social purposes . Wealth and industry are means ? means to culture , means to ease , means to life . Their value is provisional . But in the acquisitive society they are pursued as if they were endsin-themselves and they are valued absolutely : the purpose of wealth is more wealth , the purpose of industry more industry . This basic confusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of economic activity is the acquisition of wealth , not the providing of services , not the making of needed goods , then society has no way of choosing among economic activities . They are all equal : the production of trifles is equal to the production of socially necessary goods ; there is in point of fact no principle by appeal to which a trifle could be judged a trifle . Second , since wealth is the purpose of economic activity , those who possess it , commonly those who own , commoner still those " born with social and economic winds behind them , " are esteemed , given a degree of deference which their ungilded selves would never command ; while those who produce the wealth but possess little of it are condemned ? made a means to the enrichment of others . This is inequality ; it is a permanent feature of an acquisitive society . It can be measured in disparities of income . But the meaning of inequality is best expressed in existential contrasts . It means that " one man lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wears ten men 's clothes " ; while another , struggling to survive , must face the expectant eyes of his children with shame . Third , and most damagingly , the acquisitive society throws up for the emulation of rich and poor alike a social ideal of appalling shallowness . His historical criticism of the acquisitive society takes the form of demonstrating that the acquisitive society has not sprung direct from Nature , as its conservative apologists claim ; on the contrary , " The Triumph of the Economic Virtues , " as a chapter title in Religion and the Rise of Capitalism has it , came only in the 18th century , when the odd idea that the acquisitive motive was bottomlessly beneficent and should thus be free from social restraint was first elevated to the status of self-evident truth . Pope 's couplet reduces the new wisdom to a famous formula : Thus God and Nature formed the general frame And bade self love and serial he the same . The rhyme is charming hut , to the social imagination of earlier ages , the philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ages , for example , assumed that antagonism between self-love and social was in the nature of things , so it sought to keep the acquisitive motive under social control . Its fundamental postulates were that salvation , not riches , was the end of life , that the exercise of economic rights should entail the performance of socia I duties , and that moral rules were binding on economic conduct . Thus it reproved usury because it conceived of society as an organic unity , and to permit the " taking advantage of another man 's necessity " to pass uncriticized would be to sanction the preying of one member of the social body on another ; society would become a pack of wolves . Of course greed and sharp practice abounded in the Middle Ages , " but men at least called these vices by their right names and had not learned to persuade themselves that greed was enterprise and avarice economy . " The point is that economic activity was held to be subordinate to social purposes , and from this principle neither Luther , nor Calvin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave way under the pressure of modernity is the story told in Religion and the Rise of Capitalism . Suffice it to say that by 1700 the idea that economic activity should serve social purposes and that the acquisitive motive should be checked by a social morality had vanished . What remained were rights and interests , " the materials of a society not society itself . " And of these two were absolute : the right to property and the right of unfettered economic enterprise . We enter the 19th century ; we are nearly here . So the values of the acquisitive society are false . They will not bring happiness ; they create inequality ; they are behind over-production , and are thus at the root of the cycle of inflation and unemployment by which the modern economy is plagued . And they are not reflections of man 's essential nature ; at any rate other ages have had very different standards . This is the grava men of Tawney 's critique of the acquisitive society . His positive recommendations , which occupy several chapters in his book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social and economic circumstances of 50 years ago and have inevitably lost cogency with the years . What remains , nonetheless , is a work of the greatest relevance . For Tawney 's moral and historical criticism of capitalism has recently been given objective support from the work of a British social scientist , Fred Hirsh , whose book , The Social bruits to Growth . has been praised by economists of intelligence and authority . And Professor Hirsh 's book has power and importance according to one of them , Robert Heilbroner , " because he has succeeded in making moral concerns respectable in the world of ' scientific values ' by translating the sins of immorality into the problems of a dysfunctional economy . " Where Tawney criticized the false values of capitalism , Hirsh 's data confutes its " false promise " : that by means of economic growth all can share in its affluence . This had all along been the secret of the acquisitive society 's triumph , according to Tawney ? " To the strong it promises unfettered freedom for the exercise of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day may be strong . " Hirsh argues that the weak hope in vain because the goods of which economic growth consists can by their nature he enjoyed by only a small minority . They are " positional " goods ; their value vanishes if everyone can have them Furthermore , Hirsh contends , and here he is on Tawney 's ground , " We may have reached the limits of explicit social organization possible without a supporting social morality . " Rights and interests are no longer adequate as a basis for social organization ; not when welfare recipients and civil servants , corporations and criminals , all seek , as under the acquisitive ethic they are bound to seek , to maximize their interests . This is anarchy . The remedy could not be more radical : according to Heilbroner , it requires that we abandon the acquisitive moral ethos of capitalism for a more social ethic or face social collapse . Tawney would be the first to deprecate the tone of inevitability but if this is indeed the crisis we are heading for then his book will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
