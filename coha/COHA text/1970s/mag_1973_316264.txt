Things have not been going particularly well in Uganda lately . On top of the steady deterioration of the economy and continuing strife within the army , two of President Idi ( " Big Daddy " ) Amin Dada 's top civilian ministers turned up in Kenya within the past fortnight . Shortly afterward , Amin announced that he was giving the rest of his Cabinet a month 's vacation-presumably a prelude to a major shakeup . " A human being is a human being , " Big Daddy explained , " and like a car he needs refueling and fresh air after working for a long time . " <P> Last week Amin offered another surprise . He suddenly invited a small group of foreign correspondents in Africa-including TIME 'S Nairobi Bureau Chief Lee Griggs-to Kampala for a one-day visit that included a rare interview with the Ugandan dictator . Griggs ' report : <P> In a three-hour tour of Kampala by bus and on foot , I saw not a single white face on the street , and only one Asian . Uganda 's white population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than half from that of last August . There are fewer than 1,000 Asians left , mostly skilled specialists who were exempted from the expulsion decree . <P> Some 4,000 Asian businesses are now in black hands , and the hardest-working people in Kampala seem to be sign painters replacing the names of Asian shopkeepers with those of Africans . As a result of the Asian exodus last year , the town has been left without a single locksmith , and some of the new shopkeepers have had to dynamite office safes to get at records . Many of the new proprietors still do not know how to reorder goods . And new orders will not be shipped by suppliers without cash in hand , but Uganda 's import laws specify cash only on delivery . It remains to be seen whether Amin can step up his lagging policy of mafuta mingi ( Swahili for fattening up ) by forcing the banks to offer non-secured loans to shopkeepers so they can reorder . <P> There is a shortage of such staples as sugar , salt and soap , but Kampala appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ugandans , who attribute the sporadic killings by the army to dirty work done by subordinates without his knowledge . Since 80% of the country 's 10 million people live as subsistence farmers more or less outside the cash economy , the threat of a commercial collapse in the capital does not worry Amin inordinately . The coffee and cotton crops are earning foreign exchange , and Uganda 's hard-currency position seems to be strong enough to permit Amin to order a $4,500,000 Grumman jet for his private use . <P> Amin received the press on the beautifully clipped green lawn of State House in Entebbe . He spoke softly and slowly , sometimes gesturing with the immense hands that once made him Uganda 's heavyweight boxing champion . ( He is 6 ft. 3 in. tall and weighs about 260 lbs . ) " What I am doing , " Amin insisted , " is what the people of Uganda want . Nobody today controls Uganda but Ugandans . " The country was temporarily closed to tourism , said Big Daddy , until he could train his people in how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be one of the friendliest nations in the world .
