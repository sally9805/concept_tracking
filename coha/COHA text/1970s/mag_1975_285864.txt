The meeting at which the seller and buyer of a house sit down with their lawyers , lenders and real estate brokers to sign the deal is usually a tense session - not least because the two principals do not yet know how much they will have to cough up in closing costs . Under a new federal law taking effect this week , they will be forewarned , if not cheered . The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act requires that the lender give both buyer and seller an itemized list of closing costs at least twelve days before settlement . <P> The buyer still faces a bewildering array : fees paid to a lender for processing the mortgage ( usually 1% of the note ) ; fees paid to the lender 's lawyer for inspecting the title ( about $125 ) ; fees paid to the buyer 's lawyer for doing the same thing and generally making sure everything is according to Hoyle ( $150 to $650 ) ; and title insurance ( about $200 ) , in case title proves faulty despite all the money paid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's big expense is the real estate broker 's commission . All together , the Senate Banking Committee estimates , commissions and closing costs averaged $3,000 on single-family houses last year , with the burden falling about equally on sellers and buyers . <P> The new law does nothing directly to lower costs ; it merely gives a buyer or seller some time to object and negotiate . For that reason , Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire considers it inadequate and is pushing a measure that would have mortgage lenders pick up the costs in lieu of going through disclosure procedures . Of course the lenders would pass those costs along in higher interest , but , Proxmire argues , they would have an incentive to keep the costs down , and have far more bargaining power with lawyers and real estate brokers than the lonely buyer does .
