txt THE MOTHER of fugitive Patricia Hearst disclosed Saturday that the legal action now being taken by the family is aimed at preventing publication of a book by her daughter 's former fiance , which they believe could be embarrass . ing . According to Mrs. Randolph Hearst , such a book also could jeopardize any defense of Miss Hearst at a future trial . The controversy began when a onetime hook collaborator with Steven Weed , the former fiance , wrote a magazine article detailing the couple 's three-year love affair before Miss Hearst was kidnaped on Feb. 4 , 1974 . The article told of the couple 's use of drugs and other intimate details of their life together . " I DO N'T KNOW what Weed is writing , . but if it 's of an invidious nature , we intend to take action , " said Mrs. Hearst . Exclusive Patty must be protected somehow , and she 's not here to defend herself . She is still our daughter , and we are looking out for her welfare . " If that means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're concerned about issues that might have a negative effect upon Patty 's defense at such a time when she might be a defendant in a trial . " Mrs. Hearst made the comments during a telephone interview from her San Francisco apartment . AFTER A LENGTHY legal battle , Weed has severed all connections with the collaborator , Roger Rapoport , and is now writing his own book , which he says is almost completed . The Hearsts took the first step in preventing publication of the Weed book Tuesday when they filed a petition in Superior Court in San Francisco to gain control of the estate of the fugitive **28;775;TOOLONG . When she became 21 last Feb. 21 , Miss Ilearst inherited a family trust , reported to be $70,000 . She also has a bank account and other assets such as furniture and jewelry . MRS . HEARST explained that one section of the petition is directed to the specific question of the worldwide publicity that her daughter received after the kidnaping , and this " requires protection against excesses some of which represent threats by others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have asked the court to appoint a legal representative to take appropriate action on her behalf if it becomes necessary , " Mrs. Hearst said . " Maybe , wherever Patty is , she 'll read about what we 're doing , and it might present another thought , in her mind . " AS CONSERVATORS of the estate , the Hearsts also would be legally free to handle all financial matters for their daughter , such as filing income-lax rc ? turns on monies received from the dividends of her trust and signing stock proxies . Weed , contacted by telephone in his Berkeley apartment above a garage , admitted that he told his former coauthor " a lot and was frank with him , but I did n't plan on him using everything . " He continued : " I 'm not going to deny it and say everything in the article was wrong . I ca n't do that . From a larger sense , everything was pictured wrong even if a lot of the specifics were basically right . " SPEAKING OF the Ifcarsts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them until that article appeared , but it cer1 tainly did n't cement relations between us . The damage it did to Patty and me is irreparable . " I know the Hearsts are not happy with me for writing a book , but I find it hard to believe they would take any sort of legal action to stop publication of it . " Asked if the book would embarrass the Hearsts , Weed replied : " Sure , there . are two or three facts that are going to ? embarrass them , but those are minor 1 things . I do n't think that would be .1 ground for stopping the whole book . The book is certainly not like the magazine article . " I JUST THOUGHT the other honk , which was already finished , was too shallow , and I did n't take the money offered me even the I 'm now $30,000 in debt . I just hope when I get this hook done , it will signal some sort of an end to this whole thing . . . not a permanent end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In a related development , it was learned that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has renewed its search for William Harris , the fugitive Symblonese Liberation Army member , in Indiana . Harris , his wife , Emily , and Miss Hearst have been subjects of the manhunt since May 17 , 1974 , when they eluded a police dragnet in Los Angeles : THE FBI NOW believes that Bill Harris was in Centralia three weeks ago when he was stopped by police with another woman while hitchhiking . The two were not detained but showed police identification cards which have been used as aliases by the Harrises in the past . While the policeman who stopped them has identified pictures of Harris , he has been unable to identify the other woman as Harris ' wife . " But that would n't be too unusual , " said an FBI spokesman . " We know they have many friends who have helped to keep them in hiding for so long . " Investigators charted the route of the hitchhikers east to Indiana where the Harrises attended college at Bloomington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
