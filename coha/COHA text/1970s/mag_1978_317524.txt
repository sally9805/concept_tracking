The Center for UFO Studies in Evanston , Ill. , normally gets 50 letters a day about sightings of " glowing lights " and such in the sky , but since mid-December the average has been nearly 800 . At the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Mass. , calls from UFO sighters increased from fewer than half a dozen to as many as 18 a day during the past month . The obvious cause : fallout from the sci-fi smash Close Encounters of the Third Kind . <P> In the Northeast many of the reports have been triggered by glowing appearances of Jupiter , the largest and brightest planet in the region 's night sky . Another spur to UFO sightings may have been the news that the Administration tried , unsuccessfully , to get NASA to open a UFO investigation . Had Jimmy Carter fallen under the Close Encounters spell ? Not at all . The White House , weary of having to deal with its own heavy load of UFO mail , was just trying to pass the buck .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
