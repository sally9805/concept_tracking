Japan 's Chisso Corp . sold $200 million worth of petrochemicals last year , is effectively managed , and should by any standards be doing well . But Chisso may soon have to shut down . It is one of several major Japanese businesses that have run afoul of a three-year-old government principle : companies that cause individuals any physical harm or financial loss through environmental pollution must compensate them . <P> Chisso 's trouble began in 1950 after it opened in the fishing port of Minamata an acetaldehyde factory that began to discharge effluents into Minamata Bay . One of the waste substances : a highly toxic methyl mercury compound that was passed up the food chain from tiny organisms to small fish to the larger fish that comprise a substantial part of the townspeople 's diet . By 1953 the mercury contamination had reached a dangerous level in some people , who began to suffer the crippling symptoms of what is now referred to as Minamata disease . Howling in pain and racked by convulsions , 106 citizens of Minamata died over a period of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or insane . In 1963 , after scientists had determined that mercury poisoning was to blame , the government banned fishing in the bay and ordered Chisso to remove the pollutant from the plant 's wastes . The company was soon able to stop using mercury in its industrial processes . <P> An even harder problem was how to compensate the victims of Minamata disease . Many sufferers had been given court-ordered awards by Chisso in 1970 . But under what has come to be known as the three-P policy ( polluters pay for pollution ) , another group of victims sued for more money , and the courts upheld the suit . As a result , Chisso so far has had to pay the staggering sum of $67.3 million to 793 victims . As the less serious cases are identified-and there are 2,700 suspected victims still to be given official medical examinations-Chisso will be liable for compensation payments of as much as $60,000 per person . Says a contrite executive : " We have to do our utmost to pay up , no matter what . " <P> Public Outcry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments , the company lost $12 million last year . Indeed , it has been able to remain in business only by selling $40 million worth of its $250 million total assets and persuading banks to defer for up to three years interest and amortization payments on $90 million in outstanding loans . To add to Chisso 's troubles , another of its plants was partially destroyed by an explosion in 1973 . Company officials last year quietly asked the Japanese government 's development bank for a low-interest $13 million loan to repair the factory . But when news of the request became known in January , there was a public outcry . <P> " Pollution is an act akin to murder , " charged a government environmental officer , who argued that taxpayers ' money should not be used to bail out an industrial polluter . Jun Ui , Japan 's leading environmentalist , goes further : if Chisso gets the loan , he says , a wrong precedent would be set . He fears that the government may be asked for low-interest loans by other polluters-Mitsubishi Oil Co. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spill at the Mizushima industrial complex ( TIME , Jan. 20 ) .
