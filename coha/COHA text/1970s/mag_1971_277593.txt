In the theater , the luck of the English has been the Irish . From Sheridan and Farquhar through Synge , Shaw and O'Casey , Irish-born dramatists have adorned English speech with tears , wit and poetic music . All the great Irish writers possess the gift for lightening or deepening the color of language . They bring to it both a larky playfulness and a brooding melancholy . They are the unofficial patron saints of English , and it is these saints of the word whom the distinguished Irish actress Siobhan McKenna is honoring in a superior one-woman show called Here Are Ladies . Selections for the off-Broadway program are drawn from Yeats and Synge , Beckett and Joyce , as well as others ; they all mirror women as seen through Irish eyes . <P> Miss McKenna has a magnetic personality , and she knows how to populate a stage singlehanded . At the same time , she releases the audience 's imaginative powers . What animates her performance is that she so obviously loves her people deep down in her bones . Delivering a ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe ; her body becomes a crucible of Irish antiquity and suffering . <P> An evening of this kind relies on a cultural remembrance of things past . Familiarity breeds content . Nonetheless , it is the singer who glorifies the song . Perhaps Siobhan McKenna 's finest moments come in the two greatest Joyce monologues , " Anna Livia Plurabelle , " from Finnegans Wake , and Molly Bloom 's closing reverie from Ulysses . One is an ode to a river , the other to a woman . In Miss McKenna 's delivery , the two are linked in a cascade of sounds and moods-drowsy , restless , tactile , sensuous-that , with a mounting lyrical intensity , evoke the eternal waters of life . <P> * T.E.K.                     @x In the theater , the luck of the English has been the Irish .
