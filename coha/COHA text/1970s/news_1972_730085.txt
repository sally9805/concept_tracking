txt The chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board , Secor D. Browne , suggested yesterday that President Nixon name a high-level commission to explore the possibility of giving a Federal agency the job of providing , airline and airport security . Mr. Browne , in an interview , made the suggestion because , he said , the system for preventing airline hijacking is inadequate and impractical . In the international area , the C.A.B . chief urged that the President seek to hasten ratification of treaties calling for extradition or local pun , ishment of air pirates and that consideration be given to even stronger measures . Expressing deep concern following four aircraft crimes over the weekend , Mr. Browne said : " We 've grabbed the problem by the ankles , not the throat . " The four crimes alluded to were the two abortive $500,000 extortion attempts in this country , a Peruvian hijacking in which the suspect was overMr . Browne stressed that the powered in the air , and the hijacking of a plane from Puerto Rico to Cuba with a banker , hostage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and local agencies were probably doing all they could under existing laws . But he argued that the system was handicapped by the issue of " who 's in charge ? " and was " not good enough . " Mr. Browne , who was a bustSect. - D. Drown . nessman and professor of aeronautics before joining the Nixon Administration , said it had to be " remembered that we are dealing with a criminal threat to the national security ? rto the economy and to the society . " Major airports have to be viewed as the nation 's frontier and " should be protected as such , " he said . He added that aviation se:amity should be financed by the Government , a view hound to find favor with the airlines . No Pirate-Fighting Fees " I do n't believe an 18th century clipper captain was charged a fee by the Navy for putting down Barbary pirates , " he said . The man in direct charge of the nation 's aviation-securitiy program , Benjamin 0 . Davis Jr. , offered a cautious response to Mr. Browne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transportation . said he agreed with Mr. Browne 's " basic premise that the airline system is a national resource which we must preserve . " Noting that he had discussed the proposal with Mr. Browne , Mr. Davis said the ideas were " worth examining , " but added ; " I do n't think at this juncture that I would go along with a Federal force of the magnitude he is visualizing . I really ca n't visualize it . And yet a year ago I would n't have visualized several guys asking for half a million dollars . " Mr. Davis said he was confident that the existing security system , which requires all airlines to screen all passengers and luggage , was working much better than it was a month ; go and would keep improving . Breakdown in System Other Government sources said that in both weekend extortion attempts in this MITITy the accused extortionists should have been identified as suspicious in the screening , rocess and prevented from Boarding the planes . Under the system , airline tickt and other employes ire trained to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common to nost would-be hijackers . When a suspect turns up , sther employes are signaled to louble check him as he walks asst a magnetometer that deeds the presence of a gun or tither weapon . The suspect may ilso be asked for identification sr be searched by Federal mar ; lials available at major airsorts . The two men accused of exortion attempts over the veekend boarded their planes n Denver and in Oakland , ; alit . The question being looked into is whether the telltale sehavioral traits they did exlibit in the boarding procedure ' or the flights were noticed at . he time by any airline emaloyes , and whether anything teas done about it . The authorities will not identify the traits that are looked for because that would he a help to wouldbe hijackers . Under emergency rules promulgated by the Government in February , an airline is subject to $1,000-a-day fine if proper screening is not carried out . Mr. Browne 's view is that policing is not the proper job or the special talent of airlines . " Let the airlines do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And let the Government he responsible for preventing crimes , and for infractions of all sorts , not just against an airplane but involving the whole discipline of the airport .
