txt AT 11:09 A. M. , former Gov . Otto Kerner walked Into the courtroom , Smiled a tight smile at his old friend Theodore Isaacs , and slipped into his chair and the impenetrable expression he wore thruout the trial . It would only take a moment for the jury to shatter the career of the man who once ran It was a holiday  --  Presi'dents ' Day  --  to mark the birthdays of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln , and the Federal Building was empty except for tho people going to ; Judge Robert Taylor 's - courtroom . Footsteps echoed in the halls and the history of Otto Kerner 's long career would soon be , shadowed by the word " guilty. , , HE SAT IN the courtroom , at the defense table , talking softly with Isaacs , while the eyes of the press watched them and waited for the judge and the jury . Isaacs was there first . With a half-smile on his face and his hands in the pockets of his dark brown suit , he was alone for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Warren Wolfson , Isaacs ' attorney , wearing a jazzy red sport coat , joined his client . Isaacs half-sat on the defense table and the two men chatted for a minute and Isaacs shrur , ged , his eyebrows arching with his shoulders . And then Kerner walked in and he and Isaacs talked softly , waiting for the judge and the jury . THEY LOOKED confident . Much more confident than U. S . Atty . James Thompson looked when he walked in , leading the band of men who sat around the prosecution 's table . From the time he sat down until the verdicts were read , Thompson looked like he was going to have a bad day . At 11:44 , the jury filed in and none of them looked at Kerner or Isaacs and everyone saw that . It took only a second for people to begin whispering bad news for the defendants . Judge Taylor followed the jury by exactly one minute . He asked the jury if it had reached a verdict and the formen said yes . The courtroom became silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes and the eyes of all the attorneys and newsmen watched the foreman hand the envelope to the bailiff , who handed it to the clerk . KERNER 'S ELBOWS were on the table , his clasped hands forming the top of an interlocking pyramid . Isaacs ' name came first and the guilty verdict was read into a cushion of total silence . The gasps and the shortened breathing of those who watched did n't come until the clerk got to Kerner . And then it was over . Kerner , like his old friend , was found guilty on all counts and someone in the back of the courtroom said , " Oh my God . " But Kerner 's face was without expression and his eyes hardly blinked . Isaacs wore the same half-smile that was on his face when be walked in . THE JUDGE polled the jury and each juror underscored what the clerk had already read . Kerner stared straight at the jury and then watched the men and women who found him guilty file out of the courtroom . As soon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in his pockets , walked down the halls of the Federal Building , his footsteps echoing in the emptiness.
