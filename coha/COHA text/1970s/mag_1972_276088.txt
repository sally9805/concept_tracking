Of all the Nazi war criminals , few were more hated by the French than Klaus Barbie , former chief of the Gestapo in Lyon . In 1954 a French military court condemned him to death in absentia for killing the wartime underground leader Jean Moulin . Barbie then was living comfortably in West Germany and could not be extradited , because Germany , like most countries , does not allow the extradition of its own nationals . A few years later , Barbie disappeared . <P> The French are convinced that Barbie is alive and well-in the person of a wealthy naturalized Bolivian businessman named Klaus Altmann , who undeniably bears a strong resemblance to the missing Nazi ( see cuts ) . Returning to La Paz from a trip to Peru two weeks ago , Altmann declared on Bolivian television that he had served with the SS in France and Holland and on the eastern front , but was not Barbie . Even though they tend to agree with French officers who insist that Altmann is Barbie , Bolivian authorities have not decided what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime , they have jailed him on charges of owing $4,000 to the Bolivian Development Corporation-perhaps in order to prevent him from fleeing to a more secure sanctuary such as Paraguay .
