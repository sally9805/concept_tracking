BOBBY DEERFIELD Directed by Sydney Pollack Screenplay by Alvin Sargent Romance is a function of frustration . <P> However interesting their troubles along the way , the legendary Tristan and Isolde would exert but small claim on anyone 's imagination if , in the end , they were permitted to settle down in a split level to raise 2.4 children and give each other head colds . Death is , of course , the thing that finally and definitively separates lovers in our culture 's greatest romances . <P> But as a rule it is implicitly understood to be the agent of other , almost equally potent divisive forces-class distinctions , for example , or unyielding morality-and the fact that such considerations have the power to keep postmodern lovers apart for no more than about 30 seconds presents the contemporary novelist or film maker with a rather serious problem in plot construction . <P> What barriers can he possibly create to frustrate his lovers in order to 1 ) create contrast for their few moments of middle-passage bliss and 2 ) strike an ominous chord in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deerfield , which might have been subtitled " A Mortality Play , " offers an intelligent and quite moving solution to this problem by using the title character 's obsessive preoccupation with the possibility of his own demise ( and his attempts to deny that preoccupation through a studied lack of affect ) as a means of dulling the romantic impulse . Deerfield is a star racing driver whose success is based on a superrationality that requires a cutting off of all emotion . But then a car that is the twin of Deerfield 's spins out of control , its driver is horribly hurt in the crash , and reason dictates that Bobby discover what happened in order to avoid a similar fate . <P> Investigation takes him to a Swiss sanitarium where the other driver is recuperating , and there he meets an eccentrically charming woman who is dealing not just with the possibility of imminent death but with its certainty . <P> Her willful fancifulness intrigues and annoys , but in his self-absorption and disconnectedness , he misses the clues to her condition , therefore her motives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has no choice , if he wants to share her last weeks with her , but to open himself to her . In so doing he also establishes emotional connection with a past from which he has deliberately cut himself off , with life in general . Her death then becomes a kind of victory , moving one not to tears but to a sense of affirmation . <P> But one does not want to make Bobby Deerfield sound like heavy going . Director Pollack has almost flawlessly understated its case . The Europe through which his couple move is one of soft colors , handsome but not overawing . And in Al Pacino he has one of the few actors who can play narcissism without seeming to be a lummox , while Marthe Keller finds a steely spine in her characterization of what might have been your standard movie kook . She is vulnerable without being pathetic , compelling without being neurotic .
