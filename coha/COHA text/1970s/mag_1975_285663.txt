In his seven years as dean of the School of Education at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst , expansive , flamboyant Dwight Allen , 44 , worked miracles ( TIME , Dec. 21 , 1970 ) . Demonstrating a genius for fund raising , he brought in a total of $15 million in federal and foundation grants . With a flair for innovation , he transformed the small , conservative segment of the state university into a flourishing but controversial school that concentrated on urban education and minority problems and encouraged a " do your own thing " attitude among students and faculty . Wearing colorful custom-tailored African shirts , he toured the country , making as many as 400 speeches a year , preaching the free-wheeling education theories that he practiced on campus . <P> Although the rest of the university is functioning normally , Allen 's empire is falling apart . Last week a federal grand jury subpoenaed the School of Education 's financial records for most of Allen 's reign . The FBI and the state attorney general have been investigating the possible misuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three other deans have resigned . <P> Academic Retreats . The financial problems were first uncovered by then Assistant Dean Bob Suzuki while he was reviewing the school 's books . After he sent memos to the university administration about the possible misuse of funds , somebody smashed three windows of his home and stuck a note on the garage door warning , " Lay off , or next time it 's you . " Suzuki called the police , who have not yet caught the culprit . <P> Among the school 's unusual fiscal practices that have surfaced , part of a $1.4 million federal grant for a University of Massachusetts-sponsored teacher-training program in Brooklyn seems to have been spent on " academic retreats " in Montreal hotels . Two checks were made out to " consultants " who apparently did not exist . The checks had been cashed by Cleo Abraham , an assistant professor , who subsequently handed in his resignation . <P> As the investigations got under way , university officials called Allen , who has been on a sabbatical since September setting up a teachers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic of South Africa . Allen flew home , surveyed the growing scandal and promptly resigned as dean , although he retained his tenured position as a professor on the U.

" Dwight is an operator , a wheeler-dealer , " says Professor Robert Wellman . " But he is a very poor administrator . " Adds Professor Albert Anthony : " He 's a P.T. Barnum type . He knew damn well he could n't make the school rank in the top two or three in a few years by scholarly rigor . So he went into all of the innovations that were hot in the late ' 60s - all the things that were the beneficiaries of federal money . " <P> Under Allen , the School of Education earned a reputation as a diploma mill . In the past three years it granted more than 387 doctoral degrees . Some doctorates were awarded to students who had no undergraduate degrees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school level .
