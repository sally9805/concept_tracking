txt Last Tuesday , the nation 's governors dared Atty . Gen. William Saxbe to send them all to jail . The governors are not likely to go to jail , or even to be charged with a crime . By week 's end , in fact , the Justice Department announced it was " reviewing " its policy on federal lobby laws which is the issue threatening confrontation . But whatever the outcome . it is clear that the events of recent weeks have angered the governors , the mayors of cities , and other local officials . " IT DID NOT , " said one . " reflect well on the New Federalism . " That feeling was expressed to Saxbe in a telephone conversation Tuesday between the attorney general in Washington and two governors  --  Daniel Evans ER. , Wash. and Philip W. Noel ED. , R. Li ? in Seattle , where they were attending the National Governors ' Conference . According to sever al sources , it was not a friendly conversation . The dispute is over whether organizations of local government  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the National Conference of Mayors and others  --  are lobbying groups that have to register under federal lobbying laws . THEY NEVER HAVE been considered lobbies in the past . But last year , the Justice Department started an investigation to see whether the League of Cities and Conference of Mayors should register as lobbies . John Gunther , executive director of the Conference of Mayors , said Federal Bureau of Investigation agents visited the group 's offices and began questioning members of the staff . " They read them their rights , " Gunther said , " it scared the hell out of some of our people , " Allen Pritchard , executive vice president of the National League of Cities , said the two city groups decided to file as lobbyists under protest , while seeking a declaratory judgement in court against the department . The other local government organizations joined the court action . BUT LAST WEEK in Seattle , the governors decided on a more defiant course . After the phone call to Saxbe , one source said , the governors decided simply to refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Governor 's Conference said it was exempt from the law , " said one state official . " They are challenging the Justice Department to try to indict the governors . If the Justice Department thinks the Governor 's Conference is an illegal lobbying organization , it will have to bring criminal information or grand jury charges to such an effect . " The state official , a lawyer , said any such charge would have to cite the executive board of the Governor 's Conference , which has been headed by Evans . Gov . Calvin Rampton of Utah was elected as the new chairman last week . THE GOVERNORS also expressed their displeasure to White House officials attending the conference , sources said . One source said , " I think the President of the United States is going to talk to his attorney general . " State and local officials M. , ter over the Justice Department 's motives . Some attributed the problem to " an overzealous junior official " in the department 's criminal division . But others wondered whether the dispute was a residue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that documents released by the Senate Watergate Committee identified the Conference of Mayors as one of the investigation targets of Anthony Ulascowicz , the White House political spy . Gunther said that in 1971 the Internal Revenue Service audited the Conference of Mayors for the first time in 40 years . The audit was for 1968 , he said , but IRS agents asked also about expenditures " in late 1970 . " THAT , HE SAID , is when 22 mayors , headed by John Lindsay of New York , began a " legislative action committee , " which opposed many administration domestic policies . No one denies that the local government groups lobby . But they claim they are agents of elected officials , supported by state and city tax money . " The federal government , " said one state official , " is seeking to treat the sovereign states the same way it treats General Motors . " A Justice Department spokesman said that only " paid lobbyists , " not the elected officials themselves , would be covered under the department position now under review . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back down . " It has been , " said one , " a very embarrassing matter to be involved in. "
