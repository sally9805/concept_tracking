The men who made Marooned raised a disturbing and fascinating problem : How can stranded astronauts be rescued in space ? During the first half of their space saga , they exploit the mental - and national-tensions implicit in the plausible nightmare . Since the hardware and space-shot techniques resemble the real thing as seen on TV , there is an aura of verisimilitude about the mission . But the project is scrubbed after a disturbing word is flashed onscreen : Intermission . After that , Marooned rates about one-half out of a possible 2001 . <P> Three astronauts , Pruett ( Richard Crenna ) , Stone ( James Franciscus ) and Lloyd ( Gene Hackman ) , have been in orbit for five months . Deterioration of reflex and temperament have set in so markedly that the two can deliver only muted snuffles back to earth . " Return ! " comes the order from Charles Keith ( Gregory Peck ) at Mission Control . But the retrorockets misfire . With less than 48 hours of oxygen left , Control decides to abandon the boys to God and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted Dougherty ( David Janssen ) . <P> Dougherty proposes to jet up there on an impromptu rescue mission , despite the imminence of Hurricane Alice . Meanwhile , back at the launch pad , biting their lips behind the control panel during all this are the astronauts ' wives , who await an even more vital decision : Which of the trio will sacrifice his oxygen to save his buddies ? The wrangle between Control and Dougherty is reminiscent of the old **53;1930;TOOLONG disputes . But then , so is the whole plot .
