CRISSCROSSING THE COUNTRY ( as the saying goes ) . bringing joy through culture to the masses ; testing opinion , acquiring " feedback " about one 's subject so difficult to obtain if you 're an inmate of the Manhattan Island Intellectual Internment Camp ; earning what seems to a writer easy money ( i.e. , money not acquired through the painful process of hunching over a recalcitrant typewriter ) ; flinging words into the air where they instantly self-destruct and can not hover around to haunt you as printed lines are wont to do . In short , lecturing . And it did seem a good idea at the time I sought out and signed up with an agent some three years ago . That illusion has long since gone , and I 'm left with a tableau of dismal memory . A GLOOMY OLD BARN OF A HALL at a junior college in the San Joaquin Valley : I stumble out on stage to confront fifty or sixty youths scattered in variously indolent postures around an auditorium designed to hold at least ten times their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my host says . " Best crowd we 've had all year . " T HE STUDENT UNION at a teachers college in Oregon : it is exam week ; the undergraduate committee has forgotten to put up posters . and the man from the political-science department who is to introduce me ? even though he 's not just certain what it is I do ? has commandeered the squawk box to try and drum up an audience . Into the indifferent atmosphere of pool hall , bowling alley , snack bar , he flings his invitation : " Mr. Richard Schickel of Life magazine will lecture on the contemporary cinema in the cafeteria in five minutes . Five minutes . Mr. Richard Schickel . " Fine beads of perspiration appear on his forehead , apologies tremble on his lips and die under my disapproving gaze . We share similar uncertainties . I have just allowed myself to be hurled , in a large metal tube , six hours through the sky for an engagement at which $500 of the college 's money is about to be spent on entertaining three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down from Portland to hear the act . We could all have met in Uncle Ralph 's living room . AN OTHER JUNIOR COLLEGE , this one in Washington:I am part of its first annual arts festival , which , it develops , is imperiled by John Carradine 's abrupt cancellation of his Shakespeare reading . Amidst the clatter of typewriters and sewing machines ? the college is vocationally oriented ? my hosts are on the phone with Rudy ' Vallee 's agent , trying to get the Vagabond Lover to substitute for the absent actor , and a stiffish bargain is being driven . Earlier at the motel , which has contrived to find me a room entirely innocent of windows , Richard Schickel is film critic for Life . A collection of his essays is being published this spring under the title , Second Sight . just the sort of people I had hoped to encounter with greater regularity on my travels . But now the nausea is coming in awful waves , cunningly timed to alternate with stomach cramps . I clutch the podium , knuckles whitening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no use . " I 'll take one more question , " I croak . I answer it with a brevity that could not be defined as the soul of wit , though it was certainly the beginning of wisdom , and exit at speed , without pausing to acknowledge the spatter of puzzled applause directed at the suddenly empty stage . Fifteen humiliating minutes later I emerge , pale and tottering , from the men 's room to be confronted by ... a coffee hour . Much compensatory behavior ? hearty backslapping , hee-hawing good fellowship alternating with exemplary sobriety as I earnestly answer every question in excruciating detail , hoping all will understand that my peculiar onstage deportment was aberrant , not the real , charming me . T HE GAUDY DINING ROOM of a coun- try club in Houston : gently bred middle-class ladies do not like to get up on their hind legs and ask questions right out loud in an open meeting , even when the gathering is composed exclusively of their peers . Often women 's clubs skip the question period entirely , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members with small white cards on which to scribble queries in demure anonymity . As a rule , these are then sifted by Madame Chairman , who passes them on to the speaker for appropriate reply . During most of my travels I accepted the customary practice but on this particular occasion , for reasons I could never afterward explain , I decided to look through the cards myself . Would that I had never done so . I can still see the precise , firm handwriting , the neat lines seeming to express a clinical judgment from which there could be no appeal . Instead of a question , the unknown lady had announced an opinion . To the chairman she had written , We do n't want him again . " live and in color in his own persona before breathing , coughing , scratch . ing , sneezing , rustling audiences harbors the fear that , by reading the unconscious signals he can not avoid sending forth , they will discover his secret shames . And it seemed to me that this lady ? whom I imagined bright-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deeper recesses of the room ? had indeed found me out . For although I affected a casual easy manner in public , the fact is that by this time I had developed a degree of contempt for myself and for my audience . Both derived from my disappointment with my gifts as a speaker . Insecure when many strange eyes were fastened on me , I had adopted ( not entirely consciously ) what I imagined was an ingratiating style ? chatty , informal , unpretentious , reasonable . In fact , however , my tendency ? unless I am with very close friends ? is toward a certain arrogance and assertiveness , and standing up there , playing Mr. Nice , rambling more than I wanted to , I was often disgusted with the performance . And disgusted for the audience for letting me get away with it . Worse , every once in a while , for no reason I could later duplicate , I would turn into the kind of speaker I wanted to be crisp , controversial , giving the folks what they really wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get mad at myself for my inconsistency . Finally , after a few months on the circuit , I was assailed by the same whory guilt that overwhelms me when I write something purely for money . So 1 had to concede the perceptiveness of the lady who had discovered that I was traveling r under a false iden-tity . It was even kind of a relief to find that one 's worst fear was not mere fantasy , to have it made clear , in real life , that you ca n't expect to take the money and run forever . The only surprise was the place where my cover was blown . I had imagined that the dangerous checkpoints were the colleges , that I would be brought down or sent up or whatever by some bright , aggressive college kid , terrifically knowledgeable ( as a few indeed are about my subject . But . as I soon learned , this most notorious of younger generations is , for the most part , patiently tolerant of adults who do their mysterious thing for their mysterious adult reasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unthreatening manner . They are self-absorbed , conceding you your own self-absorption and generally taking a torpid laissez-faire attitude toward guests of any and all descriptions . It is the ladies ? and to some extent those adults who have for a long time acted as advisers to college lecture committees ? who have the hard noses . Their attitude might be termed one of aggressive passivity . They remember when speakers were really speakers , men and women who embarked on monumental thirty- and sixty-day cross-country tours ( by train yet ) and who depended for a large share of their livelihood on making good , strong impressions . The test in those days was how often you were invited back to the same place , how many enthusiastic endorsements the lecture agency could show other program chairmen . By contrast , the modern lecturer is usually someone who has , for whatever reason , deigned to bend over and pick up the small change of his celebrity . He does n't really need the missed connections , the crummy food , the plastic motels , and he knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more efficiently with one five-minute appearance on the Cavett show than he can with 300 lectures . So he tries a lot less hard than his counterpart of twenty or thirty years ago did . Besides , our style of self-presentation has changed ? also as a result of television and of our recently developed cultural bias toward the seminar , the group therapy , and encounter sessions . We are less and less tolerant , most of us , of someone handing down the word from on high . More and more we prefer communication involving a great deal of give-and-take among all participants . The last bastion of people who expect the speaker to do all the work , to entertain and edify them while they contribute nothing more than polite silence , is the women 's club . They want to leave the hall with a neat summary of the subject ? movies or foreign policy or the American Novel Now ? firmly in mind so they can later tick it off onetwo-three to their husbands or their bridge club . Thus this consolation for my failure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give my critic what she wants , for there are very few young orators . The going style is deliberately anti-slick . It is an earnest sincerity not to be perfectly reluctant to abandon them , since they were faithful clients in difficult days and remain so at this moment , when business is again bad . The small-time engagements also have a practical utility . If a speaker has two dates at good fees , but they are separated by an idle day or two , he can be sold cut-rate to lesser groups on the premise that anything is better than lying around a hotel reading paperbacks while the room-service tab mounts up . Needless to say , the agency 's salesmen ( mostly women in hats ) expend no great effort to make congenial matches between speaker and organization . Indeed , it ca n't be said they go to much trouble in that direction anyway . The man I worked for , a cheerful old bandit whom I quite liked , told me on first meeting that , in some thirty or forty years in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do their numbers . " I might not like a man , " he growled , " and I might get prejudiced against him . I 've got all kinds of people I hear are terrible . But out there , they 're doing great , and I ca n't let my own taste interfere . You just ca n't tell what an audience is gon na like . " So immediately one feels exploited ? too many dates at low prices before too many uncomprehending audiences l almost universally , my best experiences were before groups that had sought me out , to whom I had not been sold as an unknown bargain ) . But that 's only the beginning . Once you arrive for a date , you nearly always discover that the contract , which carefully specifies that the speaker be available for only one other activity besides the lecture itself , is honored only in the breech . There 's the dinner before the speech and the reception after ? both traditions of long standing . Then there are the two or three radio and television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a campus , requests to take over a class or two . I once taught four hours of freshman English in one day at a little denominational college in the Southwest . You are , of course , theoretically free to refuse these requests . But in fact you are a captive . Your choice again is between the four walls of the motel room and being a good sport . O N THE OTHER HAND , you soon realize that the paranoia among the hosts is at least as pressing asyour own . For example , some sponsors contractually specify that the lecturer arrive the day before his engagement . It seems silly , is often a nuisance , but there is always some historical justification for this clause ? the Blizzard of ' 59 , the Great Fog of ' 63 , when all assembled to await a speaker grounded somewhere up the line . There are also plenty of lecturers in the Dylan Thomas vein ? men who in their wanderings ( understandably in my view ) take to strong drink and/ or weak women and manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety nearly always attends one 's comings and goings on the circuit . " You do n't mind if we take you directly to the hall ? we only have a couple of hours . . . " " Gosh . I 'd sure like to check in to the hotel ? how far is it to the campus ? " " Well , normally . fifteen minutes , but with this rush-hour traffic . . . " " It 'll only take me five , just to change the old shirt . " " Well , I do n't know , we 've asked a few people in for cocktails and supper . I 'm sure I wrote the agency about that . . " Indeed he had . Twice . And one understands that some SOB came through a couple of years ago and retired immediately to his room not to be coaxed out except to give a lecture of precisely the prescribed length , after which he trundled immediately off to bed , denying the committee its customary reward ? the chance to rub up against a real-live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . T HE AGENT 'S SHARE of the paranoia comes into play when you are forced to cancel an engagement on short notice . The trouble of coming up with a substitute he can usually manage , albeit crossly . Not so simple , however , is the problem of placating the sponsoring organization . Its officers secretly believe that they are victims of a conspiracy among the sharp practitioners known to reside in New York City . They worry that their money is not as good as anyone else 's . Their tattered pride leads them to threaten ? and sometimes actually carry out ? a boycott of the offending agency 's entire client list . And in an overcrowded and decaying business there are too many elsewheres , including a new breed of agents who represent nobody and hence everybody . They operate byfinding out who a sponsoring organization is dying to have but has never been able to attract . Whereupon they go get him , shamelessly raiding the exclusive lists of the established and more gentlemanly firms . So , lately , the pressure has been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to change a date by a mere twenty-four hours and found my agent begging me not to force him to make the request . " They 'll kill me , " he moaned . " You 'll ruin me in Missouri . " I had the feeling he was not conning me , that he was honestly scared . A ND SO HE SHOULD BE . I 've checked with several friends who 've traveled the circuit . and they report experiences similar to mine : small and indifferent audiences , a steady decline over the years in bookings , a distinct feeling of apathy throughout the business . Part of that could be temporary ? in a time of rising educational expenses , the forum committee 's budget is a logical place to cut back , especially since kids do n't seem to be very interested in speakers anymore . It is also true that lectures have occasionally provided a focus ( or more properly , an excuse ) for radical activists to disrupt a campus . It happened to me once at Duke where Mike Arlen of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's campaign staff , Otto Preminger , and I were engaged for a three-day seminar on the media . " Too Establishment , " the SDS sneered ? perhaps correctly ? before we even arrived . The students in charge of arrangements countered by digging out some bad reviews I had written of Preminger 's films , and promised , in handbills , a " confrontation " between us . ( " I wo n't if you wo n't , " Otto said as we were introduced at a reception prior to the seminar . And we did n't , being gentlemen and being aware , too . that we could get more mileage out of such an encounter on a talk show sometime . So we did a little gavotte and the next day Otto decamped . Later that same night Mike and Blair and I were politely agreeing with one another at another seminar , when damned if the SDS crowd did n't leap to the stage and take the microphones away from us . We retired in good order and started making inquiries as to when the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said one of the SDS kids . May ' ) e we could all get Does an Italian wine go with gourmet food ? Plymouth Cricket .
