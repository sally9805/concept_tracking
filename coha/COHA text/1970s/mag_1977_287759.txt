Few U.S. corporations have been so badly tarred by revelations of illegal political contributions at home and questionable payments abroad as Gulf Oil Corp . Since those dark days a year and a half ago , Gulf had seemed to make considerable progress in restoring its reputation . Among other things , it ousted Chairman Bob Dorsey and replaced him with Jerry McAfee , who had run its Canadian oil subsidiary and had no connection with the payoffs . Yet last week the Pittsburgh-based multinational was enmeshed in a new web of scandal-especially concerning a uranium price-fixing cartel that it had joined with McAfee 's awareness . <P> That was not Gulfs only problem . A federal grand jury in Pittsburgh last week also indicted two Gulf executives , Vice President Fred W. Standefer and Tax Compliance Manager Joseph F. Fitzgerald , on charges of bribing an Internal Revenue Service agent who audited Gulfs books . According to the indictment , Gulf paid $3,300 in air fares , lodging and other perks , to send the tax man , Cyril J. Niederberger , and his family on five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Las Vegas . Niederberger has already been convicted for his part in the scandal and is appealing a six-month jail sentence . During his trial the Government charged that Niederberger greatly underestimated the amount Gulf paid to political candidates . <P> Serious as the bribery charges were , they are far overshadowed by the uranium cartel . Gulf , through its Canadian mining subsidiary , was the only U.S.-affiliated member . Other participants were the governments of Canada , France , Australia and South Africa , a string of major uranium-producing companies in those countries and an English-based mining company , Rio Tinto-Zinc . According to a stack of sensitive Gulf and Canadian government documents-subpoenaed by a House Commerce subcommittee and made public last week - the cartel was highly organized , with a paid secretariat in Paris and detailed rules for 5 rigging bids , allocating markets and driving up prices . <P> Though the cartel existed only from 1972 to 1975 , it appears to have hit a jackpot . During that period world uranium prices exploded from $6 a pound to more than $40 ; they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price rise was that Westinghouse Electric Corp . in 1975 reneged on contracts it had made with 27 U.S. utilities to supply them with uranium for their reactors at an average price of $9.50 a pound for 20 years . The utilities sued Westinghouse and the matter is still before the courts . Westinghouse in turn sued 29 uranium producers , including Gulf , charging them with price fixing . A Washington grand jury began investigating last year after the Justice Department , which is also probing the matter , received a number of Gulf documents . If an antitrust case against the producers could be made to stick , Westinghouse 's legal justification for scrapping its contracts would be greatly strengthened .
