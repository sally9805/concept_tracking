time measured by sands in a glass or by clocks , time passing has been too short for measuring . A few grains of sand , a stutter of the clock hand , a blink of the eyes . Time for a few strokes of the oars of the barge , a call from the coxswain , as she eases into the river and the incoming tide , straightens and steadies to go . If sun were shining , sky were blue , and water calm , they would still be floating in the shimmering image of the Tower . Having moved less space than a stone 's throw . Such is the time of memory , though memory may be long . Time of tides is otherwise , rising and falling to the whims of the moon . Rising and falling to the stirring and shifting of the vast sea , engirdling the landsman 's world . The sea owes fidelity and obedience to the moon ; yet the sea and the winds are free to blow and rage together from all quarters , and free also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , servant to the sea , rising and falling to a great command , within an ordered scheme . Yet the simple truth , and any fisherman or waterman can tell you so : no two rivers or harbors have the same scheme of time , rising and falling . Each with its own rhythm and order . Andp195even within that ordering much change according to the seasonsand the moon . And the fat or thin of the moon comes from the sun , as the moon on its own rhythm and set in its path as strict as the river must follow its banks . That moon , ever the same , is ever changing , new to old to new again , and thus forever different . Tides of the sea will sometimes rise high , lap over bank and wharf , flood low places and then withdraw again . Against those tides , steady and undeterred , is the river 's flowing . Which , according to clouds and sky and rain , according to the wealth or poverty of well and freshet and spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a cargo of earth , now slow , a thin clear trickling . And more than once in a lifetime has turned into an ice as thick as stone pavement . Each thing , all things sublunary , being bound in obedience to the other , yet each in bondage separate and free to be and becomeitself . By letter of natural law condemned to constancy . Yet , by the terms and spirit of the same law , pardoned and free to be forever changing , thus ever inconstant ... . Standing , his hand light upon the shoulder of an oarsman , who has dipped and pulled his oar a few strokes only , breathing the river , Ralegh can picture in the same tumbling time as a shuffling cascade of cards the journey of the river toward this place . A passage to here and beyond . Arising , some say , from the seven clear cold bubbling springs , called Seven Sisters , near Cheltenham . Others name other sources ; no matter . For certain this river flows two hundred crooked miles to London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshets , streams , rills , and these all fed by the waters of wells and springs beyond counting.  |p196Flowing  toward London and the sea . Past many places he has known . Past Oxford , where gentlemen and scholars can boat but are not supposed to swim . But where on warm nights without too much moon he shucked clothing and played and splashed like a dolphin . And once on a bitter starless night when the river was all thinly frozen , he slipped out of chambers , climbed silent over the wall , and went alone to break the sheen of ice and feel the breathtaking cold as he plunged in to test his manhood . As a boy will do . Flowing past Oxford , walls and towers of colleges . Where the river is called Isis . Beginning a taut loop , a bending , like a pulled bow , as it runs past the ruined Benedictine abbey at Abingdon , once nearly dyinginto nothing with the monks gone , but now reviving on the power of malt . Past Dorchester , where the Augustinians were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baptized in the river . And where no snake or adder may dwell within the sound of the bell of the abbey church of Peter and Paul . Below here Isis and River Thame join in matrimony , the holy mystic copulation of waters , to become one  --  the Thames . Subject worthy of celebration by his friend , the poet Spenser . And , indeed , Spenser was planning such a poem once  --  EpithalamionThamesis . In which not only Thame and Isis were to be wed , but every river and stream in England would come as wedding guests . Past Wallingford , named for Saxon crossings , where the cock crows and hens lay eggs in the ruins of the abbey and the duchy castle still stands proud , though harmless now . Sec how the river , renewed , now begins to wander idly , as ifp197more sure of its destination , certain and unhurried , south of the chalk and the tall beeches of Chiltern Hills . Going gentle past farms and villages , and half-timbered houses . Grows stronger and deeper , drinking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abbey have served to make a royal lodge , the Queen 's House , and been dispersed to many purposes . Then turns again to uncoil in a shivering of loops and slack knots like a tossed length of line . Passing by Sonning and Henley . Bending up and around and down again to run beneath the gray freestone battlements of Windsor Castle , lofty on one bank , and the school of Eton upon the other . Windsor , a proper royal castle , sited splendid upon a chalk hill to view the woods and fields and the river . Windsor , once perfection of and still a wonder for hunting . Especially for the red deer . With sixty and more parks for this purpose , each enclosed , but by gates opening into another . Arthur is said to have built the first fortress tower here , where now the central keep , like the drum of a giant , stands . And there are those who multiply the myth beyond the powers of imagination , saying : long before Arthur it was Arviragus , son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who is skeptically inclined will confess the original to be old . Someone before the dawn of English memory built there . And all kings thereafter built upon the place anew or repaired the old . Three courts , each one within the other . Chapel of St. George there , saint of the Knights of the Garter . Where hang that order 's shields and helmets and banners . Where is a most remarkableorgan able to mimic the noise of any musical in/strument . Tombs and towers . Residences and apartments furnished with hangings of gold and silver and precious stones . Some chambers all ceilinged and walled with mirror glass . A high open-timbered gallery from which the ladies can watch the hunting . And for a conny of quality , native or stronger , who is willing to believe , there are such treasures as the horn of a unicorn , nine spans long . Or the magnificent Bird of Paradise , bird which never pecked or flew nor had to be gutted and stuffed , being artfully contrived out of air and feathers and whole cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood and jewels called joinery and hangings and glass mirrors repeating the image of a man beyond counting be emblems for Windsor . Rememberingthat all these can be easy enough packed and removedand rearranged in another place , for another time . As in the theater . For theater it was and remains though the old stones are true . And the river , no trick of scenery , flows by , indifferent to both truth and illusion . The river flows on , in a while dividing round the sparse island of Runnymede . Where a king of England , bowing his head to parchment , in the iron presence of his barons , did , with no more than a whisk , a scribbling , scratching flourish of the end of his pen , change the chronicles of England forever . Now moving , a lazy snake in the first warmth of spring , as towns and villages press closer to each other  --  Egham , Staines , of the old London Stone , Chertsey , Walton , Hampton , Molescy .... Now and next , and properly called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephant of folly , which serves the Crownp199better  --  Hampton Court . Close by the bank of the river and made of red brick . Enter the gate , above which remains the late Queen 's golden rose and her device , Dieu et mon Droit , into a puzzles game of ten courts . With , outside the walls , two parks , one for the deer and the other for coursing hare . Enter into a plenitude of chambers , residences , apartments . The chapel and hall , high-vaulted with Irish oak which forbids spiders and cobwebs and will stand off any insect or gnawing vermin . And here most especially the strangers who visit  --  princes , nobility , ambassadors , and such  --  are bedazzled by the richness and abundance of things  --  hangings , tapestries , paintings , the wonders of the Paradise Room . But if dazzled by the opulence , they are delighted by contrivances and curiosities : the machine of the fountains in courtyard and garden , permitting the water to be played upon as a musical instrument , from towering jets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tears ; the twelve Caesarsdone lifelike in plaster ; spheres and astrolabes ; exact portrayalsof the native man , woman , and child Sir Martin Frobisher brought home with him from the Northwest , together with their curious clothing and the costumes of others from far lands ; musical instruments made of gold and silver and glass ; the head of the spear which was thrust into the side of our Lord and Savior . The river goes on without awe or servility . Lazy and indifferent to the wonders and follies of man 's making ... . Here at Hampton our King assembles the full Court in early September . And his Court has grown so large with new offices and appointments and hordes of hangbys , that even the King must read the Book of Offices to know one from the other . Andp200not all the apartments of Hampton can house them , but fields and courts of tents are needed . The river needs no book to make distinctions between fool and wise men , all being equal ... . The river needs no accommodations , being surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant for that courtier with a full purse of unworried time to spend . Great Henry left cockpits , bowling alleys , tennis courts , and tiltyards enough to keep them so busy in idleness as to be unable to meddle in affairs of state or to sweat too much while waiting for advancement . Here will be Anne of Denmark , wife to James and friend to Walter Ralegh . Unless , in her illness , she is still at Oatlands . Now comes Kingston , where in dim days Saxon kings were crowned . Widening , deeper , the river passes the palace of Richmond . A favorite of the late Queen , though not so much for pleasure as Nonsuch or Greenwich . Most remembered as the chief seat of her grandfather , Henry VII . Place where , still a princess , she was reconciled with Mary , the Queen . Together they came from London in midsummer on barges covered with fresh flowers so that each seemed a floating garden . Came to feast in the banquet house upon a miracle of sweetness , a huge cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweets to show the arms of Spain . Place where we came from London on torchlight barges , to the noise of musicians and under a canopy of fireworks , for a night of revels  --  masques and dancing , perhaps a play . Place where Elizabeth took much delight in her grandfather 's cunning secret passages.  |p201Place  where it pleased the late Queen to permit her godson , Sir John Harrington , to build and install his wondrous new invention , the Ajax , a machine designed to replace the privy and the Jordan pot of the chamber . Calling him her saucy poet of the laystow , the Queen allowed it . But also allowed as how the galloping rush of waters which followed upon the pulling of a chain near frightened her out of her wits and like to have bound her innards for a week . Saying : " Go to , Sir Jakes , your jest will be the ruin of my bowels and is unfit for all but savages . Take a patent upon it and sell it to Irish or blackamoors . But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry VIII , young , made entertainmentsfor the Venetians . And where , after many years and near to the end of her reign , when the Venetian Ambassador , Scarmelli , came to complain of English pirates , the Queen receivedhim grandly and graciously chided him for long years of silence from Venice . All in his native tongue . And after he had bowed and departed , the Queen turned laughing to her Court , half in wonder herself , for she had not spoken the Italian tongue in half a century . Place for such curiosities as the chamber where Henry VII died , the walls sprinkled and dotted with his blood according to his wishes . Where can be seen the round mystic mirror wherein that king could see all things presently passing in the world , on land and on sea . Which mirror broke at the instant of his death . An inconvenience for all future kings of England . Place for the library of Henry VII , an abundance of printed books and manuscripts . Some forbidden , dealing with magic and black arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twenty feetp202in length , demonstrating the genealogy of the English kings from Adam onwards . Where one Henry died and where King James ' son , Henry , Prince of Wales , spent his final summer . A place of too many deaths to please our living King . Except the one death which pleased him . For here at Richmond , alas , the late Queen suffered her illness , dying upon the eve of Lady Day . Beyond Richmond and coming to the curving turn at LambethMarsh . Passing the old manor house of Copped Hall , where the Lady Arabella , eager as James , waited for the Queen 's choice . Now at the turning , tall upon the south bank , a sprawling of brick and stone , high-topped by towers , is Lambeth Palace , seat of the archbishops of Canterbury . Highest above the outer court walls , overlooking the river and half of London , that small tower built a century and a half before by Archbishop Chicheley , for his convenience in the leisurely torture of the Lollard heretics . Across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace , the abbey , and Whitehall . And now at last , deeper , still running clear , the river swallows up the waters of London , gulping the Fleet without hesitation . And taking thereby much that is foul from London , darkening its clarity . Taking London 's waters and waste , but leaving a blessing for fishermen , fishmongers , and tables , a treasure of trout , perch , smelt , shrimps , bream , flounder , haddock , and many others . Sometimes , though rarely , a catch of carp . And upon occasion the fat salmon , though never so sweet as the salmon of Exe and the Dcvon rivers . Flowing past London , now eagerly dreaming the sea ahead.  |p203Perha|ps  one last regret , a moment of hesitation , a bulge and loop , like a gut , at the Isle of Dogs , with Greenwich and noble buildingsacross the way . Salute to Greenwich , then , and off and away , wider and deeper and swifter , running easterly past Beckton , Woolwich , Grays , Tilbury  --  where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fight  --  and Gravesend . Until , like a huge jaw yawning with astonishment , the river goes to sea . Waves shrug ermine shoulders . Shrieking gulls claim possession of blustering air . There with wind to fill sails and belly them out like a woman with child , strange chords plucked from lines and halyards , the rig strummed by mad fingers , a cithern accompanying the crying of the gulls , who wish us no good luck ; there to sail south down the British Sea toward Westcountry ports . And from there on a day of favoring winds to set forth to far southern islands . Where , at last , we turn westward with the trade winds and follow the sun , to sail on into the burning water and gold of the sky ... . But he is not on any rolling , pitching , wind-teased vessel now . The breeze on this river is not more yet than his own breath . He sighs for the shimmering , evanescent , butterfly 's wing of the present moment . Which reason again reminds him is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always threatenedby memory and wishes . Or is that true ? Why not call the present the sum of all ? The trick of time lies in its deceptions . Pea in the pod , shellp204game , past , present , future , shift place in one instant and who can say which is which and be sure ? Oars of the bargemen rise and dip and pull together , light and easy , wet with fresh drops as they feather , then swing to pull again . They hold the slim barge straight , riding clean in the water toward the arches of London Bridge . Ralegh sits down , taking a place beside Apsley . His legs are tired . The watermen and passengers in boats and wherries have seen him and guessed the purpose of this journey . They will have told his name a thousand times before twilight . Indeed , before midday dinner his name will be bruited the length of the town . So much value , then , for the precautions taken by these gentlemenfrom King 's Bench . There are more virgins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more black swans than virgins . Seeing now , in dawnlight hodgepodge , hurly-burly , huggermuggerof the rooftops and gables , spires and bell towers , all shapes and sizes . Across a slant of distance , rising above everything , the bulk of St. Paul 's . Taller than all even without its spire . Shape of a lazy giant , half asleep , sprawled , propped high upon one elbow , heavy-lidded , overseeing all . The inlet at Billingsgate . They pass close by a weather-worn merchant vessel , her ordnance bristling . Watermen are off-loading cargo to the wharf . Back from the Baltic run , with rough furs and straight Polish timber lashed on deck . London Bridge growing sudden and hugely ahead . With noise of water running through arches . With dim clatter of traffic overhead . Twenty-one stone piers to hold up twentyp205arches . Water narrowing , blocked by corn mills and waterworks on the south side and by heavy-timbered starlings built out to protect each pier . Narrowing so strict it makes waterfalls at the peak and the turn of the tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best of the watermen and allows an unwary passenger to taste his heart . Did that also young and green with another whose name I can not remember . Upon a wager and too drunk to fear the devil . And the waterman prayed like a Turk atop a temple howling when we steered his boat clumsy and laughing through thunder of white water to drop and spin around like a chip in a whirlpool . Yet not so much as a drop splashed our clothes . London Bridge was built for wise men to go over and fools to go under . Fool or wise , I have walked over and around more times by far than I have gone under . For ever since I first crossed over , I have rejoiced to walk in the crowded savage streets . Savage ? It seems so to the stranger . Friend Spenser , reared and schooled here , calls it " merry London . " Our King calls it " a foul town . " Though famine and plague may scatter the crowds  --  not silencethem , mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in triumph and festival  --  they return . Coming leaping back to spawn again . And such a rage of color and textures . Granite stone from Cornwall and Devon , sandstone brought from York , freestone and , chiefly , Caen stone from Normandy . Marble from the Isle of Purbeck . Brickwork , glazed or plain , every age and shade , from blood and rose to rose pink . Plaster and timber , oak from Shropshire and Sussex , Lancashire and Cheshire , dark as ebony from time , or tricked out with gilding and painted dec/oration . Roofs of slate or lead and sometimes , against all commonsense and regulation , of plain timber and even thatch . Such colors in the streets  --  flowering of signs and banners and pennants . And swirling street crowds . As if each dirty roadway , street , and alley were a river of flowers and flesh . No , not of flesh . Flesh not often seen except when some rogue or mort is stripped to reveal it . And it , too , is colorful soon with stripes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strangers are paper masks , their bodies clad , even the poor , in such various colors you can believe the shards and fragments of all the broken stained glass of England were seeds . Took root here by the river in the bonerichearth . From which these living flowers bloomed . Here the figure fails . Who 'd sniff the scent without a strong nosegay in one hand , a pomander in the other , and a bag of sweet herbs around the neck ? Whoever heard of flowers who can bawl more noise than a battlefield ? Though it may be if our ears were rightly tuned we might hear garden flowers shriek or squeal like butchered beasts when the cold knife cuts them off at stem or they are yanked by the roots to slow death ... . A head-tilting look , straight at the roofs of the high houses on the bridge . There toward Southwark side stands that new buffoonery some wag calls Nonsuch House , a drunkard 's fancy in timber , made by Dutchmen and shipped over to be pieced together here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather vanes to rival the pickled heads on the gate . I will not picture how my head might look , no man beingp207at best advantage bodiless , unbarbered , grinning on the end of a pike .... And , going under , craning to see the tower of the Chapel of Thomas built upon the central pier of the bridge . The crypt , they say , has a secret flight of stairs to the river . For a man in danger to go down . Better it were for a man to go up , I say . . . . Smoking chimneys of houses . Each year the chimneys multiply , not going forth , but standing in one place . Multiply and grow taller to belch more smoke of sea coal and wood . Under the bridge and look to the left now . To Southwark and tower of St. Mary Overy . Which some call St. Savior . Many a marriage , many a christening , and funeral there . Many the tombs . And lately it is again the fashion to be placed there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the old poets excepting Chaucer . A painted effigy beneath a canopy of carved stone . His head resting upon his three most celebrated volumes for eternal pillows . And an inscription reading : " Whosoever prayeth for the soul of John Gower , he shall , so oft as he doth , have an M and a D days of pardon . " Then let us all pray for John Gower 's soul until all England is pardoned forever . . . . Out of sight , down the road to Canterbury , stands Old Tabbard Inn . From whence the finest English poet before our Spenser , and Spenser 's master and better , set forth with nine and twenty others on an April pilgrimage . All their pilgrimages are done with , both Geoffrey Chaucer and Edmund Spenser now lying in a corner of the Abbey of Westminster , hard by the Chapel of Henry VII . Chaucer , thep208Flower of Poets , and Spenser , named Prince of the same breed , close together . Setting a new ambition and fashion for our poets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only for ambition but , ever the satiric wit , for the poet 's justice of it . Saying : " By God , when I was a bricklayer , I laid half the new brick and repaired half the old that is there . It is only right I should be allowed to rest there too . " Oh , old Southwark has many fine taverns and inns now , and a cluster of no less than five jails . None of them vacant or idle . No scarcity of that sort of pilgrim . Now Bankside . Where the wise , going up- and downriver , disembark to walk around to the other side of London Bridge . Bankside , proud with the Bishop of Winchester 's old palace . And beyond there seeing the rising up of the familiar shapes of the playhouses , the Rose and the Globe . The Globe new built again since that time when he watched from the Tower to see it burn , an unplanned part of the show of Henry VIII by William Shakespeare . And also , standing taller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our English Circus Maximus  --  the Beargarden . Where , though you can see neither Jesuit nor Puritan fed to lions , you will see native English dogs test courage against the bear and bull . Or an ape with a whip ride a pony like a man , round and around , shouting in an incomprehensible tongue , fleeing a pack of wild dogs . Or a blind bear chained to a stake fighting off dogs and ripping them gutless as cleaned fish . All this and more if blood is your pleasure . Your hard-shell snail of a Puritan rails against it . Just so calls the playhouse the house of the devil . Being able to speak withp209the most righteous vehemence because he has never been to either . Tell him there are many worse things to see in this world if he will open his eyes . And he need not travel far , not beyond the limits of his own ward , to see them . Go ask some drooling , poxed wretch , with a ruined rotten flap of a nose , to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he will hawk and spit at your face . Nothing special in that , though . For a man can acquire rosy emblems of the French disease in any ward or liberty of London . And for a modest price . Even , indeed , in stately shadows of Westminster . Though a man must pay more dearly for a lady 's favors there . Passing now the inlet of Queenhithe on the London Bank . So soon ? His looking at Southwark and Bankside costing him more time than he knew . Has gone past Ebbgate and Dowgate , with barges loading and unloading , already . Here lies a middling-size Spanish vessel , of too much draught to ease into the inlet . Therefore anchored , fore and aft . Offloadingcargo to watermen . No love lost there between them , amid the shouts , as oranges and lemons go ashore and casks of Spanish wine . The Spaniards certain the watermen will dawdle and loaf time away , costing them tide and breeze . The watermen thinking what the returning cargo to Spain will be . Thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thinking : We are not galley slaves yet , so mind your sharp voices , you blackbeard bastards ! Just ahead lies Puddle Lane Wharf , overseen by the towers of Baynard 's Castle , as old as the Tower and built by a lord who served the Conqueror , to match the Tower and to end the old wall of London.  |p210Baynard  's Castle now wasting and crumbling away . Though Great Henry came there often and troubled to rebuild it . And there most proudly lived the Earl of Pembroke , who proclaimed Queen Mary , and upon occasion of her first Parliament paraded to Baynard 's Castle with two thousand men and sixty of his gentlemen , men in velvet coats with chains of gold , gentlemen in blue coats and each wearing the Earl 's badge of the green dragon . And once the old Earl held a banquet for Queen Elizabeth and afterwards they climbed a tower to see a display of fireworks , the river afire with reflection of falling stars . Three towers face the river and an ancient gate with portcullis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wharf . But this morning no carts rumble under the gate . They are busy at Puddle Wharf , loading barrels of beer and returning to the new-built brewhouse nearby with barley and malt and hops . To be brewed with sweet healing waters from the well at St. Bride 's . If you prefer our old English ale , sir , I say we should turn back to Southwark . For Southwark ale is so snappy and strong it will keep a man from church ... . Now Blackfriars and the wharf , a free landing place . And once , before the Dissolution , the sprawling seat of nine acres of the Preaching Friars . Where Parliaments once met . Where Charles V , Holy Roman Emperor , was lodged . Here Cardinal Wolsey was tried . And here , too , ecclesiastics gathered to hear a cause of matrimony between Henry VIII and his lawful wife . Which , unforeseen then , was to be the end of Blackfriars . The old parish church of St. Anne is a stable for horses . There are tennis courts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lord Cobham , kept chambers in the porter 's lodge , and had his garden . Ralegh dined there once too often . Here , in the larger precinct , Ben Jonson lived . And Robert Carr , Earl of Somerset , and his lady lived there too , before they were imprisoned . In ' 76 the old Parliament Chamber was rebuilt into a private playhouse , smaller than the suburb theaters , and with seats in the pit . And there he saw by candlelight , in the company of others from Court , Jonson 's The Case Is Altered , and many a comedy acted by the Children of the Chapel Royal . When that theater closed  --  he could still go to see the Children of Queens Revels at Whitefriars  --  he tried his skill with Rocco Bonetti or his son , Italian fencing masters who kept school there . Bonetti was quick and nimble . Give him a chance and he 'd take your buttons one by one with so delicate a flick that he would neither scratch the skin nor tear clothing . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versed in the rough and tumble of plain swordplay . As witness the scars he wore from choosing to cross blades with that stout London master , albeit a loudmouth bragging rogue , Austin Bagger of Warwick Lane . To dance and to capture buttons is good exercise for eye and hand , but has not much to do with the craft of carving and killing . In the last years of our Queen , after shrewd Burbage rebuilt the playhouse in an extraordinary grand style and brought the Children of the Chapel to play there , Ralegh came often to see them perform the plays of Jonson and Chapman and Marston . And in ' 17 , fresh from the Tower but forbidden the Court , he could be where the Court often was . Came there to witness work of new men like Massinger , Beaumont and Fletcher . Itp212was only then , when it would serve him to be seen , that he paid the high price and sat among gallants on the stage . Plays were better seen in the suburb playhouses . But if you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper Londoners , those few , hate the stage !  --  you must settle for children . Who can sing and dance well , and be observed in comfort , with an intermission between the acts . And there at Blackfriars is the machinery for any kind of scenery and for daring celestial flights . But you must go back to Bankside for cannon fire and fireworks and booming of bass voices . The end of London 's wall at the bank , River Fleet pouring sluggish water into the Thames . Next Bridewell Palace , whose stones include those of Montfichet'sNorman castle . Bridewell rebuilt by Henry to house Charles V in splendor . But the Emperor preferred Blackfriars , and put his company and retainers in Bridewell . Its two courtyardsand apartments now serving as a hospital , workhouse , prison , and a little Bedlam for fools and mad . So many these days that Bedlam will burst like a windy corpse wrapped in tight lead . Almost a tavern for the district ; for with the ancient sanctuaryrights still reserved at Blackfriars and Whitefriars on either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishops and judges still lived there . Sign of the Stark Bedlamite , BareArsed ... . It was this wildness and the stink of muddy lanes and the river rising by the moon in January and February ( you could float a fair-size wherry in the hall , then plant a crop in the mud left behind when the river withdrew to its course ) made Kings Henry and Edward give over Bridewell and Savoy Palace as well to charity.  |p213Look  left and south now to see , already behind as we cling close to the north bank , the landing of Paris Garden stairs leading up from the river . And near there the theater called The Swan . Then , as the bank begins to bend south and west , that wide space of low ground , Lambeth Marsh , crossed by the track of the Roman road to New Haven . Tops and towers of Lambeth Palace . Nearer to hand , rowing close by the bank now , is Whitefriars . Once friary of Carmelites , the brick now broken and repaired into lodgings for gentlemen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackfriars , there for pleasure . Pleasures of Whitefriars are dimmed by the site . Lower and just below the terraces of Temple Garden , Whitefriars suffers from damp and fog and flooding . And in the press and crowd of old buildings the privilege of sanctuary has gathered an assemblyof rogues of every kind . There are more alehouses and taverns than dwellings . By pitch dark the shouting and singing and tumult can guide a man here as safe as any burning beacon . From one of these taverns , in the early days of James ' rule , two servants of the Scots Lord Sanquhar waited to follow the English fencing master , John Turner , to his house and to waylay him . Not with sword and dagger . For John Turner , though drunk as a wheelbarrow , could have carved them up like capons . No , they murdered him with pistols . They were quickly found and taken . Confessed they were paid by Sanquhar . Who had by accident lost an eye , and with it , he imagined , his honor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for the English were much outraged at the swarm of Scots nobility who had come down , like a flock of hungry corbies , upon them.  | " The beggars have come to town , " the London rhyme went . " Some in rags and some in tags . And some in velvet gowns . " And all the skeptical-minded , meaning every man jack and knave in London and Westminster , waiting to see what action the King would take . The King , weary of the Scotsman and needing a bone to throw to English pride , gave Sanquhar over to English law . Whereupon all learned a thing or two . Lord Sanquhar learned he might hold title in Scotland , but none in England . He stood trial as Robert Crichton , to hang as a common felon . And the King learned that his gesture was not taken as a generous gift but a right . And the English learned that the King would let a man of his own hang if the death served a turn . What James had not learned then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the marrow of his bones ?  --  was the paradoxical nature of Englishmen . Who would not , will not , can not be reasonably pleased . They might have been half pleased by clemency . For no man but a savage brute is a steadfastopponent to mercy , the more so since mercy is the King 's right . And , curious , though muttering against his mercy , they might have begun to love him more . For he would have confirmedtheir doubts and skepticism . To flatter a man 's worst opinion of yourself may be an end to distrust , if not the beginning of friendship . They might have honored , even as they professed contempt for it , the common humanity which will sometimes permit a man to ignore principles and policy out of loyalty to old friends . The English are most difficult for strangers to understand.  |p215The  trick being that at bare-arse bottom they are single- and simple-minded . Poor James , he will die without knowing the English are easy to please ... . Now here are Temple Gardens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Temple Stairs ahead . Where a few scholars in gowns are calling for watermen . Why , come aboard this barge , young gentlemen . We are for Westminster , where you may learn some law not taught in readings and moots . Come join us at Westminster Hall , where a suit may hang for half a year before a half-hour 's hanging at Tyburn will end it . . . . Temple Stairs , where so many times he has stepped to shore to walk up the lane to Middle Temple . Where , for a time , scholar or no , he kept commons regular , even attended readings and moots when he could not avoid it . But was never called by the benchers to be a barrister . Now thinks he would willingly bid his present companions farewell to walk up that lane and turn in at the gate with the arms of Cardinal Wolsey above it and , on the sides , the arms of Middle Temple , a red cross on a white ground with an image of the Paschal Lamb center . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commencing with learned benchers and judges and the Lord Chancellor of England himself , are led by the Master of Revels , to dance three times around a smoky sea coal fire . And we drank deep , and at Middle Temple there was more playing at dice than any tavern in London . With London on the one side and the Court upon the other a young man need not stir far to divert himself . A most pleasant place to be for a time . Unless , like Edwardp216Coke , of Inner Temple , you must chain yourself to a seat , as rarest volumes are locked and chained , and squint yourself half blind in study . Wonder now , those years ago at Winchester , whether Coke was lightly pricked by one oblique dart  --  " Is it not strange for me to make myself Robin Hood or Kett or Jack Cade ? " Coke must have cursed Jack Cade one thousand times over . Having found the trace of his crude hand in many blank spaces . For that traitor hated all lawyers . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawyers ' chambers and houses , burning every piece of paper they could find . Old Coke in his studying must forever picture flames and fountains of smoke rising up to the sky . And , hidden in that smoke , a multitude of lost words . Was it Cade or Wat Tyler ? No matter . All traitors play mischief with the law . Yet , Sir Edward , the law is always the victor . Finding a precedent for even these . Arms rightly taken by Middle Temple , for we alone of the Inns preserve the order of those military monks and dine , as they did , with the benchers at the raised table like knights , barristers ranked as brothers , and those who merely keep commonsas novices . Their ancient cow horn still calls to dinner . And we gather to dine in the hall , newest and finest of all the Inns . High and wide , all strutted with beams of best oak and gilded pendants . Oak paneling all around , and those panels glittering with arms and devices of famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated and one larger one stained , as it were , with the arms of men from here who have been Chief Justices of England . Not so rich , nor so crowded , as Inner Temple . And , Lord ,  |p217we  were strict with rules and fines and observances ! Must never fail in attendance at chapel . Must not wear more than three weeks of beard . Must ever be seen in the sad-colored gown with more pleats in the back than the wrinkles of Medusa . Must wear no silver buckles or velvet caps , boots or spurs , silk or furs or great ruffs and such . Though at Middle Temple we were permitted both sword and dagger . I would willingly walk there now . Though I fear the porter would . not admit me , not even to serve as a wash pot . If strict in observance of rules , we were equally exact in our pleasures . Especially in customs of revels at All Hallow 's Eve , Ascension , Candlemass , and , most fully , every night from Christmas Eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temple Bar and are alongside the liberty of the duchy of Lancaster . Here begins a splendid row of palaces , built along the river . Each with landing place and water gate , high-arched and ornamented . Each with gardens and muster of buildings and outbuildings . Each holding space between the strand and the river . First Essex House  --  once Leicester House and before that the place of the Bishop of Exeter ; now called after the rash Earl who rallied his men to go forth from here , then sadly returned to end this farce of rebellion . All in a day 's work . Next comes Arundel House , built of and upon the palace of the bishops of Bath . Much repaired and amended by the young Earl as a place to contain his treasure of paintings and strange sculptured figures of unpainted stone . Has he returned from Italy yet ? He was a friend and may be yet , though he has lost his investment in the Guiana venture. . . .  |p218Newer  built , in trim , symmetrical Italian fashion , the stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old towers of Burghley House behind it seem to sit upon the roof of this one  --  it is spacious enough to have needed the grounds once accorded to two bishops , Chester and Worcester . Its prospect is toward the river and the south , not being built Janus-faced like the others of this row . The King has given it to Queen Anne , and all are commandednow to call it Denmark House . But many forget the new name . The Queen herself , out of forgetfulness or modesty or both , calls it by the old name . And here 's the Savoy , the hospital built into the shell and ruins of the palace of John of Gaunt , once looted and pillaged and burnt by Wat Tyler 's men . At Ivy Bridge is Robert Cecil 's house , which some call Salisburyfor his title , newest built of all along this row . Fine brickwork and timber and a wonder of windows . And each and all of these , excepting , of course , the Savoy , if not new-built , then all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With tapestry for the walls , paintings and portraits and carved figures . Kingly displays of plate and jewels and curiosities . All furniture of fine wood and veneer and inlay ; turkey carpets enough to clothe half of London 's poor . Plastered ceilings and painted and gilded timbers . With least sunlight or lighting of candles , these rooms spring to life and dance with color as if to music , composed not of notes and harmonies , but of the colors of the rainbow . Wide stairways made for easy , proud walking . Heavy and solid as ship timbers with their rich-carved banisters and newel posts . Floors strewn with clean fresh rushes and the rushes scentedp219with herbs  --  saffron , rosemary , meadowsweet  --  to sweeten the air . Places created for feasts and dancing , music and singing , and late hours with cards and nuts and fruits and good wine . Each made to represent the image of earthly paradise , salute to , symbol of lost Eden . In keeping with which image , each has its enclosed garden with the trees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world growing , well tended there . Each with paths and mazes of hedges , its sundials and figures and fountains and ponds , secret jets d'eau for laughter 's sake . Stroke by stroke , even and steady , the oars rise , dip , pull , rise , and feather again . Moving in concord together . Moving to another music of time . Two times are a counterpoint . His own , a lifetime in little , a walk and a turn in the gallery of his mind . And the future sits silent beside him , written upon the faces , set like masks , of Apsley and Wilson . And even back toward the dwindling tops of the Tower and the shrinking bridge . Pulling strong together as they ride with the still rising time of the tide and against the time of the river 's flowing . As they stroke and pull they are the inhabitants of past and future . Or perhaps they think nothing at all , feeling only strain of sinew and muscle , fresh sweat on their faces . Stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durham House . Which  --  and that 's another time indeed  --  was his . Outwardly built in the fashion of castles , for the Bishop , with round towers , turrets , and battlemented plain walls ofp220gray stone . And Ralegh kept it that way . His concession to fashion being the marble arch in bastard Italian style at the water gate . Kept the face and expression of Durham House as he found it . Because it pleased him . And also because he enjoyed the contrast with the others along the row . At a great distance , from any direction , his house , just within bounds of Westminster , would , by contrast , catch the eye . And kept it so , as well , for the sake of increasing the pleasures of surprise . For behind those walls he ripped out and gutted the innards and spent a fortune in building and furnishing until , in truth , nothing except the chambers of the Queen shone so bright or bold . Outside a kind of disguise . Within the secret was revealed with stunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . Just as an oak or cedar chest , locked and dusty , tells nothing of what it may contain  --  a king 's ransom in treasure , or rags and tatters and broken things . Likewise the garden . Where he planted and kept strange fruits and flowers , shrubs and trees from all the world . His covered and carefully tended orange trees gave good fruit . And one was a marvel , a single tree growing oranges and lemons and limes and all their sweet kin , hanging like manycoloredbaubles there . Bess never liked Durham House . Too damp for her there . Too close to Court , from which she was barred . Yet he spent happy hours alone in the small turret which he had remade into a kind of shore cabin , with books and charts , paper and pen and instruments , and a powerful eyeglassto enjoy a long view of the river and a closer look at the heavens by night.  |p221Perha|ps  that was the reason Durham House made Bess unhappy . With one sweep of a glass from the turret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would feel him catching a seafarer 's itch to be off again . In his best days he lived there lordly , with a host of goodweatherfriends , and some true ones as well . Had forty serving men to wear his colors and arms . Which was more men , twice over , than the warders of the Tower . Well , thanks to the wheel of Fortune and the King 's whim , it belongs to the bishops of Durham again . Thanks to Robert Cecil 's speculations , the New Exchange now stands on part of the grounds . Comes now York House , home of lord keepers and lord chancellors . And again the residence , after a sojourn in the wilderness , of Sir Francis Bacon . At last , here is Whitehall . Spacious palace and buildings . Splendid tower of the chapel rising . Largest of palaces in Christendom , they say . And it will be larger by far if Mr. Inigo Jones has his way and the King finds the money to humor the builder . The late Queen loved this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through her reign . Even into the fading twilight . Sound the trumpets to announce the feast . For she loved the tones of the trumpet . Games in the gardens . And some of them were innocent enough . Sport in the afternoon  --  bowling and fencing , fortunes wagered on the bounce of a tennis ball . Masques and pageants , feasts in the old banquet house . Coming and going , with flourish and ruffles , great ones from all the world . Cards and dancing and music and long walking in thep222gallery in the evening and in times of bad weather . What a wonder it had been ! Memory of Christmas Revels there , like a string of prayer beads , waking dreams interrupted only by real ones . And a young man seldom need sleep alone . Giving of gifts to the Queen upon Twelfth Night . All in the Court , from Lord Chancellor and Keeper of the Great Seal to lowliest servant , striving to catch her eye and win approval with the finest gift they could , each exceeding his means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a child , laughing and touching and counting . Never forgetting the giver , for good or ill . The Queen recovered her fire that Twelfth Night at the end of the century . Twelfth Night was the last night of Revels in those days . James , they say , will one day soon have to abolish Lent to prolong Revels until Easter . Twelfth Night in Whitehall Palace the whole Court was there and likewise two most distinguished strangers . A befurred and thick-bearded Muscovite lord , a man disguised as a bear , come to be the new Ambassador . The other , young and trim , slim of waist , broad of shoulder , tuned and well-turned of leg , dressed like a prince and perfectly tailored , an Italian , the Duke of Bracciano . He brought some light back into her eyes . After a feast , they gathered in the hall to see a play by William Shakespeare . Who , if he lacked the learning and thunder of Kit Marlowe or the careful , calloused hands of Ben Jonson , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a shoe or a glove , and could always turn a phrase as easy as he turned a profit . He could shake the platform with clowns and heroes and villains . Mr. Shakespeare , though solemn andp223correct , was ambitious . When he walked the boards as an actor , he played kings . Twelfth Night , the comedy was called , and the Queen was much pleased by the quick turns of plot and the satirical thrusts . She led the laughter and applause . A year later and the dark began to reclaim title to her eyes . World turned and dimmed too . Laughter that leaves a bitter aftertaste was the fashion . Ralegh returned to Middle Temple for the Revels and saw another play by Shakespeare . Ever a vane to the winds of fashion , the poet gave the scholars a feast of the fare they enjoyed , a play called Troilus and Cressida , all composed of follies of war and lechery . And they laughed at the chaos and barbarism just beyond them , howling outside walls as thin and frail as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , cheek by jowl along the smooth bank , behind whose roofs tower the shadowy buildings of the Abbey and the palace of Westminster . And there . . . there is the incomparable high roof of Westminster Hall . At the landing there are a pair of royal bargemen , clad in proper blue , waiting to take hold and tie the barge fast there . Behind and above them , on the flight of stairs which leads from the landing to the gate in the wall of houses , there are two armed yeomen of the Guard . These are not so tall as the yeomen were when he was their Captain and his size was the measure for the Guard . They had to scour all England then for giants and , rarest , for graceful giants who would not tangle their feet or trip over each other 's partizans . . . . " We are here , " Wilson says.  |p224And  Apsley touches his arm lightly , repeating : " We are here , sir . " Such a short time , " Ralegh says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I scarcely noticed . " " May I ask what you were thinking of ? " Apsley still touches his arm as if to direct him , to keep him from falling when he stands . " I was thinking of the light in our late Queen 's eyes , how light her eyes were , even to the last , when something made her happy . . . . You see how mad the thoughts of an old man may be . " " And why not remember that if it pleases you ? " " Because we deceive ourselves , " Ralegh says to him . " The last of that light is gone . " The coxswain eases the barge alongside the landing . Not so much as a rocking of it as oars go up high and blue-clad bargemen loop lines to make it fast . The yeomen begin to descend the stairs , coming toward them . Ralegh stands up , so quick that Apsley 's hand falls away . " I shall lead on . I know the way . " One hop and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stones of the landing , eyeing the advancing yeomen , then turning back to the barge , leaning upon the walking stick , offering his hands as the gentlemen scramble out of the barge . As if he were there to welcome them.  |p225Across  the landing , flanked by the brace of yeomen , they begin to climb marble stairs . Moving slow to keep to the rhythm of a limping man , while faces at the windows of houses and others behind them , riding the Thames , watch all this . And going under an archway , its figures and words of stone blurred by seasons , and into the large bare stretch of yard leading toward Westminster Hall . Symmetrical , the hall guarded by two square-shaped towers and the roof rising steep above all , reaching a peak in a pendant where a weather vane turns in search of the breeze , the entrancewayand above it the huge arched window , wait for them . From the clock tower Great Tom booms the hour . Announcingnine o'clock of a Wednesday morning in the Michaelmas Term of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feast day of Saints Simon and Jude . None of the courts of Westminster will be in session . Not the usual crowd of lawyers and clients , witnesses , servants , the idle and curious , to witness the session at King 's Bench . Someone has planned it so , but there is a flaw in the planning.  |p226Everyone  knows there will be no sessions in the courts today . And so an assembling of judges , lawyers , clerks , servants , and others for King 's Bench will have wakened curiosity . Easier for a fair woman to go stark naked and unnoticed at Bartholomew Fair than for such a secret to be preserved . There is already a little crowd off the streets near the entrance to the hall . Peter Rush has been waiting , standing just within the entrance . He has seen to the care of the horses and he has assisted Yelverton to robe himself in an upper tiring chamber . Went down then to the porch and planted himself to be sure of a place . Knowing that once Walter Ralegh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like flame in kindling . But it is late and nothing has happened . He sees two yeomen and some officers coming . Whoever it may be he does not recognize . An old felon , no doubt , a man bent with a walking stick , wild white hair , gray beard . Some country man who has seen better days . Judging by his heavy wrinkled mud-stained hose , old-fashioned breeches of faded tawny , ill-fitting doublet with gaps and with buttons missing , brown leather jerkin and no cloak and no cover for his head . Some poor fellow whom Fortune has ill used . Peter Rush almost turns away before he sees the eyes of the man . Then he can not believe his own . Peter Rush , once a servant in the Court of the Queen , who has seen so many come and go , knows this is the man he has been waiting for . But how sadly altered . . . . Ralegh has paused a moment , breathing , leaning on his stick . He looks into the eyes of Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clipped to his waist . Steps past the yeoman , holding a comb.  | " Oh , Sir Walter , " he says . " Let me comb your hair . " " Let them comb it that mean to have it ! " Ralegh snaps , brushing away his hands . Someone behind them at the entrance murmurs the name . Then it is shouted in the yard . " It is Sir Walter Ralegh , brought from the Tower ! " Running feet on the gravel . A growing ring of staring faces . The yeomen and the officers move closer . Ralegh puts his hand on Peter Rush 's shoulder . " Peter Rush , " he says , " I remember you well . " " We have both seen better days , sir . " " Do you know , Peter , if there is any plaster which will put on a man 's head again once he 's lost it ? " Peter Rush removes his own woolen cloak and places it around Ralegh 's shoulders . " It 's bitter cold in the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They move on , followed by a crowd , leaving Peter Rush standing there thinking . Suddenly he laughs out loud . " What ails thee , Peter ? " That is John Greene , servant to one of the judges . A big bluff fellow nibbling from a basket of hot chestnuts . " I ca n't help laughing , John , " Peter says . " I spent a full hour this morning helping my master dress up for this occasion . " " And ? " " And the old Fox has foxed them again . " " Devil take them all ! " John says , offering him chestnuts . They enter the port of the hall , passing beneath clock and bell over the entry . Pause there a moment while Ralegh rests , catchinghis breath and exchanging words with a servant who recognizeshim.  |p228They  stand waiting upon Ralegh while he speaks with the servant , the servant looking every inch his superior . On each side of the entrance port are stairways ascending , one to the Court of Exchequer , the other to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving again into and down the length of the oldest , largest hall of this kingdom . Begun by the son of the Conqueror , but built by Richard II . Who then lived to be deposedhere . Once , long ago , the pride of kings . Where Christmas feasts and the Revels were held . Where often there was dancing and , upon occasion , even tennis . And once in a flood lords andlect ; the Great Hall is reserved for practical affairs of state . Above are the places for the Parliament , Lords and Commons  --  the Commons meets in cramped St. Stephen 's Chapel  --  and various courts of law . Below lies the cellar , called " Hell . " But the hall is wholly given over , during four terms , to the law . Chancery and Common Pleas on either side near the port and entry . They go down the length of the hall . Nearly a hundred yards in length and full twenty yards across . And so high that the celebrated oaken ceiling is lost in gloom . Down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired rushes as they move toward the partly screened southeast corner and its shining marker  --  a wide white marble bench . Which is used by kings at the feast of Coronation and gives to this court of law its name . Going past the ascending stairway that leads up to St. Stephen's. courtiers played at rowing boats in this place . Now used for feasts and such no more except at Coronation . Now the palace and apartments around it are in much neg/Going past the stairs that rise to the White Hall and to the Court of Wards and Liveries and to the Court of Requests . Halting to face the marble bench . Heavy trestle tables for the judges and lawyers . They wear their outdoor hats , and cloaks and furs are worn over their robes against the cold . Some sniff at nosegays to stifle the stink of rushes . Ralegh stands facing the judges , leaning on his staff , silent , expressionless , as Lord Lieutenant Apsley , upon receipt of the writ of habeas corpus , which he studies with care , formally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with hooded eyes , studying the names and faces before him . The King 's in the country . Hunting again and with such passionfor the chase that he may yet rid England of game before he dies . Ralegh sees no one here who might be the King in any costume , behind any beard . Sir Henry Yelverton , King 's Attorney General . Stout , bluff and forthright . Eager for the King 's favor . More caution than tact . A man in his early fifties , some ten years younger than Ralegh . Cambridge man and a scholar from Gray 's Inn . Will be a judge one day , if he continues to please . If he learns to oil joints and curb tongue . His father was a good Parliament man . . . . Sir Thomas Coventry , Solicitor General . A man of forty , friend to Yelverton . More moderation than zeal , more mercy than thunder . A good lawyer and a fair one . Plain speaker , but forcefuland persuasive . Likely to be Attorney General soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are three puisne judges of King 's Bench . Only three ? There should be four and also the Chief Justice if this hearing is to be valid . Sir Robert Houghton , Norfolk man , a few years older thanp230Ralegh . In Parliament he stood for Norwich . Lincoln 's Inn his school . Some say he is a good judge  --  prudent , learned , temperate . Bacon calls him a soft man , malleable , and easily persuaded to follow with the majority . Sir John Croke , of Ralegh 's age almost to the year . From Buckinghamshireand to law by way of Inner Temple . Ralegh remembershim from Parliament . He was Speaker of the House in ' or . Dark-haired  --  it must be dyed now  --  heavy-browed , black-bearded , dark-complexioned . Known all his life as " a very black man . " Sir John Doderidge , close to his own age . These lawyers live long ! A Westcountry man from Exeter . Oxford and Middle Temple , studying there when Ralegh did . Knew him there and in Parliament also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well " like a good archer . " Strong supporter of the King and ready and willing , unlike many judges , to give opinions in secret . They call him " The Sleeping Judge " because he closes his eyes when hearing a case . Sir Henry Montagu , Chief justice of King 's Bench . His grandfather , Sir Edward , was Chief Justice also . Henry Montagu 's a Cambridge man , studied at Middle Temple . Ten years younger than Ralegh . Knighted , together with the multitudes , by James in the first year of his reign . Resolute and vigorous , yet at ease . Replaced Coke when Coke fell in ' 16 . He holds the key to what will happen here . Among other worthies present Ralegh spies George Abbot , whom James made Bishop of London and then to the amazementof all  --  most especially to elegant Lancelot Andrews , who thought himself sure to be chosen  --  Archbishop of Canterbury . Holds an uneasy favor with James . A man of not much mod era/tion and less tact . Has opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Viscount Doncaster . Scotsman who came down to England as the King 's favorite . But always his own man . Lavish in taste and dress , he nevertheless has shown no signs of gnawing ambition . Has served the King well and honestly , though often at variance with policy and willing to say so . He is as strong opposed to Spain as Ralegh . Hay will give the King a true report of these proceedings . Someone has brought a stool . He nods and , as he sits , sees Francis Bacon , Lord Chancellor , taking his place on the King 's marble bench . Where , except for the King , only the Lord Chancellormay sit . Sir Henry Yelverton is on his feet to speak for the Crown . Gripping his stick , Ralegh swallows an urge to smile . Beneath his loose flowing robes Yelverton shines , barbered and dressed for dancing and a masque . Somehow foolish in all his splendor . Seems troubled as well . His round face wrinkled with a frown . " I shall call upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the conviction delivered against Sir Walter Ralegh at Winchester . It has been fifteen years since then and this man , the prisoner , has been for fifteen years convicted of treason and sentenced to death . The King , His Majesty , out of his abundant grace , has been pleased to show mercy to him until now . Now justice calls to him for execution . " Yelverton has moved closer . Stands silent a moment , eyeinghim . One hand nervously touches links of the heavy gold chainand medallion the Attorney General wears . He shakes his headand turns hack to face the judges of the court , raising his voice . " Sir Walter Ralegh has been a statesman and a man who , inp232regard to his parts and quality , is much to be pitied now . He has been as a star at which all the world has gazed . But stars may fall . . . . Nay , they must fall when they trouble the sphere wherein they abide ! " He pauses again , gestures toward Ralegh . Then steps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , words quick , flat , routine . " It is therefore His Majesty 's pleasure now to call for the execution of this former judgment against this prisoner . And I now ask order for the same . " Not looking back at Ralegh , he returns to his place . The clerk reads the words of the judgment at Winchester . Chief Justice Montagu asks the prisoner to hold up his right hand , signifying that he had heard and understood the judgment . He does so . " Now then , " Montagu continues , " what says the prisoner why the execution of this judgment should not be awarded against him ? " Ralegh rises and limps toward the table . Halts and leans on his stick . " My lords , my voice has grown weak from illness and on account of the ague that troubles me even now . Therefore , I should like to ask you for the relief of pen and ink so that I may answer . " Montagu shakes his head . " You are audible enough . We can hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you please . " " My lords , I hope and trust that this judgment of death I received many years ago will not now be strained to take away my life . In His Majesty 's commission for my late voyage , my lifep233was implied to be restored . I was given the power of life and death over others . Surely under law my pardon and restoration was implicit . I undertook that voyage to the honor of the King to enrich this kingdom with gold . If the voyage miscarried . . . " " Whatever you say concerning the voyage is not to the purpose of this hearing , " Montagu says . They wait for him to speak . For a time , brief enough but silence is long , he stands and stares at them , moving his head slowly to look into the eyes of each of the judges , coming back then to rest a stare upon Montagu . His left hand ruffles his white hair . Someone coughs . " So be it , then , " Ralegh says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from His Majesty , " Montagu says . Ralegh waits silent . " The King 's commission can be of no service to you , " Montagu continues . " For treason can never be pardoned by implication . That is the law . You must , then , say something else to the purpose . Otherwise we shall have to proceed with the order for execution . " " It is apparent , my lords , that nothing whatever I can offer in my own justification will be to the purpose . Therefore I submit myself to the judgment and put myself wholly upon the King 's mercy . There is a stirring at the table . No one expected this to come so swiftly . " There is wisdom in your submission , " Montagu says , after a moment . " Yet I do honestly hope , " Ralegh adds , " that the King will take compassion upon me , concerning this judgment rendered so long ago . His Majesty was of the opinion that I received morep234hard usage than justice that day . And there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that . " " You have been as a dead man to law for fifteen years , " Montagu answers . " The King , in his mercy , has spared you all that time . And it might seem heavy if now , without some reason or provocation , the sentence of death is to be exercised in cold blood . But this is not so . You understand full well how your new offenses have stirred up and wakened His Majesty 's justice to revive the former sentence . " Ralegh nods and waits for Montagu to continue . " I know that you have been valiant and wise in the past , " he says . " And I doubt not that you retain those virtues . Now you shall have occasion to use them . In the past your faith was questioned , but I am resolved that you are a good Christian . Your History of the World , an admirable work , is the witness to that . " Nevertheless , in spite of his intentions , Chief Justice Montagu finds himself proceeding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death . Ralegh stands listening , attentive , humble , but stonefaced . It is Sir Henry Yelverton who is wondering what it is about Ralegh which can make an otherwise intelligent and politic judge turn into a tendentious , tongue-wagging fool . It is as if the judges spoke to relieve themselves . As men snatched and saved from peril may babble nonsense , the sound of their voices serving to prove to doubtful mind and body that peril is past . Exactly . . . But what peril had old Popham felt ? True enough , on his deathbed he asked forgiveness for his part in that first trial . Montagu , however , has no such feeling . This hearing has been brief beyond anticipation . The others must be as surprised asp235Henry Yelverton . Must feel , too , a slight sense of disappointment . Like him , they prepared themselves , were ready for everything . Except what has happened ... . Therefore  --  Yelverton 's mind impatient to grasp at a conclusion  --  there is a similarity in difference . Both times Ralegh astonished his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory for him . The execution of judgment , the passing of sentence , which ought to be the triumph of the law , becoming someway diminished in importance , an irrelevant epilogue to a play of which he , the prisoner , is author . What else can a judge do , stunned by the feeling of impotence , but plead his own case ? Ralegh stands and listens without expression . Patient and knowing . Like a kind father hearing out a tedious story told by a child . Yelverton bends his head as if to examine papers and covers a smile with his hand . For he thinks he sees the grotesque beauty of it . The Fox has tricked them again and especially the King . In this , the last act , he has made his entrance in most pitiable condition  --  shabby , ill , and old . No one who has seen him today can fail to pity him . No one can but wonder what purpose the death of this man can serve to either state or King . All the weight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against one frail old man . Were he guilty of a thousand heinous crimes , it would be difficult to rejoice at the victory of justice . Perhaps the word of this , or some sense of it , will go to the King at his hunting . Lord Chancellor Bacon will no doubt send report . It would be like James Hay to leave this hall and mount a horse and ride to the King . It is possible , Yelverton thinks , that this is Ralegh 's stratagem.  |p236Re|port  of the hearing , together with appeals from friends in high places , might cajole or frighten the King into another act of mercy . Yelverton has already learned of petitions sent from Lord Carew , from the Bishop of Winchester , from the Spanish Dominicans , who fear any Jesuitical triumph , and from Queen Anne . There will be others . Ralegh will lose his life or he will not . Let us assume the King is unmoved . Then he will go to his death as he is now , a poor harmless wretch . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case much like a lawyer , Yelverton thinks . But not with words this time so much as with his life , with his body and soul . And here is a dimension of freedom which staggers the mind . It is , indeed , as if he were a star , moving to a different music , ruled by other laws than ours . Quite suddenly Henry Yelverton is pleased with himself , for he believes at last that he has found the keys to the man . Montagu has finished his peroration , urging wisdom and courage . He has stated that execution is granted . Ralegh moves to speak , but before he does , Lord Chancellor Bacon is on his feet , coming down from the marble bench , two of his young servants assisting him with his robes . He carries parchment , the seal of the kingdom showing on it . He bends close to Montagu to whisper . Montagu examines the papers , then passes them to the clerk .

" Herein , signed , and sealed on this date at Westminster , His Majesty , dispensing of the manner of execution according to the former judgment and releasing the prisoner ofp237same , that is , to be hanged , drawn , and quartered , says : Our pleasure is , instead thereof , to have the head only of the said Sir Walter Ralegh cut off , at or within our palace of Westminster , commanding the Chancellor hereupon to direct two several writs under the great seal ; one to the Lieutenant of the Tower , or his deputy , for the delivery of the said Sir Walter Ralegh to the sheriffs of Middlesex at the said palace of Westminster ; and the other to the said sheriffs for the receiving of the said Sir Walter Ralegh from the said Lieutenant , and for executing him there ; for which this is to be his warrant and discharge , against us , our heirs and successors forever . ' " Chief Justice Montagu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the King 's clerks were in such a hasteto write this down for the King 's signature before he departedthat it is a wonder that any man could understand it . Ralegh raises his right hand . " Let the record show that the said Sir Walter Ralegh has heard and understood the pleasure of His Majesty , " he says . Some at the table , and others who have gathered around to hear , chuckle at this sally , but Montagu silences them with a cold glare . " My lords , " Ralegh says , his voice stronger now . " I have some requests to make and something more to say , if I may be heard . " " You may speak . " " I shall be as brief as can be , for I assume that many here present intend to go their several ways to dinner . And indeed I confess that I look forward to my dinner today , since it seems likely to he my last one . " " Take as much time as you need .

For I need time before my executionto settle both my affairs and my mind more than they are at this moment . For , as I say , I have much to do for the sake of my reputation , my conscience , and my loyalty . And I beseech the favor of pen and ink and paper , so that I may expressmyself and , as well , that I may discharge myself of sometrust of worldly matters that were put in me .... " Yelverton thinking that all this is intended for the King . He need not have asked the judges for the privilege of pen and ink and paper . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and the time of his death .

" And I do lastly humbly beseech your lordships that when I come to die , I may have leave to speak freely at my farewell , to satisfy the world only in this , that I was ever loyal to the King and ever a true lover of the commonwealth . For this I will seal with my blood .... " That the King may be reminded that a man upon the scafold always has the last word before the ax falls . . . .

" My lords , I bid you farewell , craving your prayers for the mercy of God . " He bows his head , his lips moving as if in silent prayer . Then turns and moves toward Lieutenant Apsley . " It appears , Lieutenant Apsley , that you are now free and clear of the burden of me , " he says . " Since I am not to return to the Tower with you , will it please you to dine with me here ? " Apsley is hesitant . " I thank you . . . I fear that I . . . " " Be my guest as I have been yours . A man must eat dinner . I promise you the best fare I can provide . " " I am grateful , sir , but ... " " Good then . Show your gratitude by joining me and eating hearty . " He turns his back to Apsley , calling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Middlesex ? " Judges and worthies are mounting the stairs to the upper chambers . Yelverton starts to follow them , hesitates , then pushes through the crowd to where Ralegh stands talking with Apsley and the sheriffs . He must say something , if only to pray his forgivenessand to wish him the mercy and love of God . Before he can speak , Ralegh faces him and is talking . " That was a nice figure of speech , Mr. Attorney , the simile of a falling star . For a moment I thought I heard the silver voice of your late father . " Yelverton flushes , clears his throat . Before he can answer anything , Ralegh continues . " I would add something , " he says . " A star in the firmament ,  |p240however  bright it may be , is but one of many . We look and behold it in its proper place , and that is sufficient . But mark this : whenever a star falls , it burns so bright it dazzles the eyes of the world . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " May God and His Majesty have mercy . " " Amen to that . " Ralegh strips off the woolen cloak and hands it to Yelverton . " Pray return this to your man , Peter , and thank him for the use of it . " Yelverton nods and takes it . Together with the walking stick which Ralegh gives him . " Farewell , Mr. Attorney . And may God and His Majesty show mercy to you , too . " Ralegh turns to Apsley and the sheriffs , leaving Sir Henry Yelverton burdened with a cloak and a crude walking stick . Yelverton looks at the stick a moment , then looks up again to see the tall man striding out of the hall with the officers . Not the least sign of a limp now . Sir Henry Yelverton shakes his head and smiles . He is thinking that in this strange year of three comets , signs which have people talking of the end of the world , he could not , indeed , have found a more telling figure of speech . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . Indeed , moments after the judgment , he hired messengersto carry the news to Bess , to servants , and friends . He has invited Apsley and the sheriffs to join him at dinner . Poor gentlemen , the King has added to their burdens . For this is their last day in office . Tomorrow , upon Lord Mayor 's Day , two new gentlemen selected as sheriffs will be sworn in here atp241Westminster . There must be some doubt as to which of the four will legitimately hold the office when and if he is to be executed . They must prepare a scaffold in Old Palace Yard in haste . And be prepared to contend with a large crowd of people . The King has been ill advised . Apparently his stratagem is for the pageants , processions , and festivities in the city to be honey to divert the flies . He must have forgotten that the ceremonies requirethe new Lord Mayor of London to come here to Westminsterin the morning . And that event , even without the prologueof a state execution to attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming out of the hall Ralegh sees a small crowd gatheredoutside already , and spies an old friend , Sir Hugh Beeston . " Will you be there tomorrow morning ? " Ralegh asks . " You can count on it . " " Well , " Ralegh says , glancing at the crowd , " you may be hard put to find a place . I fear you will have to shift for yourself . Thank God , I am sure of one . " Moving on then , taking his time , talking with Apsley and the sheriffs while the yeomen make way for them . Here is a kinsman , Francis Thynne , a kind-hearted man with the shadow of a Puritan . Ralegh greets his kinsman and invites him to dinner too . " I promise you the best dinner that my money can buy , " he says . " And money can work magic . No miracles , of course . If I could perform a miracle I would invite everyone here to share a basket of loaves and fishes . " Others laugh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry it with too much bravery , " Francis whispers . " Your enemies will take exception . " Ralegh puts his arm on his shoulder.  | " Ah , Francis , " he says , " this may be my last mirth in this world . Pray do not begrudge it to me . When I come to the sad parting you will see me grave enough . " Walking away , head high , not needing a walking stick . Has left it in the hands of Sir Henry Yelverton to do with what he will . A token , just as Yelverton gave him one  --  the figure of a falling star . He will not think of Yelverton or figures of speech or the walking stick now . He is preoccupied with arrangements to be made for his quarters in the gatehouse , for dinner to be ordered for his guests . For everything that can be done to pass through this time with composure . After that , after he has composed himself , there will be time for other things . There will be time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he did so during the hearing . Listening and not listening . Could read Henry Yelverton 's face . Yelverton was astonished . What Yelverton saw was a ragged , disheveled , sickly , pitiable man . Who had been always , even in disgrace , among the brightest , and now was diminished to least luster . Men of the world , the judges and lawyers and other worthies present , could not be certain whether this was only another stratagem of the Fox . Since they could not determine this , they would do what they were compelled to , accepting it both ways at once . His appearance being , then , both crafty device and truth . Truth or craft or both , he forced them to perform their duty with a reluctance , a muted reticence . Has any man ever been so quietly condemned ? In a larger sense , the cornered Fox was asserting the lastp243freedom left to him . He was left with a choice of style . He exercisedthat choice and caught them unaware . In acting freely , he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fable , of which all , including himself , were a part . Exceptingone thing : he took away the right to possess what they did not have any claim to except by his volition  --  the right to choose the manner in which he would meet judgment and bear defeat . This is a small exception . But there are times when something just so small can render the astounded beholder speechless . Times when the simplest exercise of liberty can dazzle those who witness it . So it was , then , with that man of the world , Sir Henry Yelverton . Yelverton was forced to grasp for an appropriate convention . For lawyers as well as poets know there are moments of truth whose only true expression is in the conventional . And so he expressed himself , on behalf of the King and the law , with the figure of a falling star . An image , it is true , from the old astronomy , already much questioned . No matter , though , about the science of the night . The truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralegh has been as a star at which all the world has gazed ... . Indeed ? That figure might have better suited the lamented Essex . Who sought and coveted admiration . And who died for it . Yet Yelverton , seizing the handhold of convention , meant more than that . Meant also , by similitude , an alien and admirable creation , a nature of different fire , moving in time to tunes beyond reach and pitch of mortal ears . A dancer moving inp244graceful motions to a music of concord and harmony . Dance and the harmony of the music being beyond common understanding . Subject to the same law which governs sticks and stones , snowflakes and raindrops , snails and whales , earth , air , fire , and water . Subject to the same law , yet likewise ruled by another law , much like that law which governs the motions and brightness of stars . In one rhetorical stroke Yelverton placed the case of the King before this court . Saying , in effect , that though the common law of this nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the law of the sun could be summoned . The King , being the sun , brightest of stars . Saying not that injustice is justified , but rather calling upon a justice above and beyond the power of the Court of King 's Bench , though the exercise of it must come through the judgment of that court . And thereby ending all argument and contention . Leaving the matter entirely in the hands of the King . But , live or die , Ralegh has gained a marvelous new thing . Sitting to hear the argument , standing to hear the judgment , Ralegh felt free as a falcon sent aloft . Though belled and bound to return to the wrist of his keeper , he was for that moment free and high-flying , sailing in the easy rolling sea of the air . Thinking then : let these and all the world judge as they are able . To some a lunatic . To some pathetic . To some a fool . To some ridiculous , depending on a simple , foolish device to save himself . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For he has managed to make his death  --  if it comes  --  a sort of murder . To make his life  --  if mercy should be granted  --  a just reward . Perhaps a few , if not Henry Yelverton , have moved beyond commonplace conclusions . Ralegh outfoxed enemies and sur/prised friends . Now the King is forced to act . If the King has planned this game to its very last trick , saving one final trump to be turned up and played , Ralegh has deprived him of the pleasure of playing that trump . Live or die , he has deprived the King of some freedom . To be a king in bondage is to be no king at all , even though those bonds are frail as a spider web . Something else he has gained at the hearing . He came before them not in humility , but the image of a dishonored man . Seemingto welcome and embrace dishonor . It is the eyes of this world which award honor or dishonor . The world can bestow honor or dishonor , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the indifference of the man himself . A single man 's indifference shatters the power of the world to pass judgment . Therefore , if the world is not to melt away in self-contempt , it , too , must act . Knowing , even as it does so , that any demonstration of spurned powers is ridiculous , the world must bestow honor or dishonor upon a man who has challenged both . Just when Ralegh was able to renounce both honor and dishonorequally , false idols and strange gods , Sir Henry Yelverton , fumbling and finding an old figure of speech , awarded him more honor than he had ever held. has been as a star at which all the world has gazed . . . . Spoken in past tense to describe a lost condition . To make the most of his present condition of dishonor . In short , an equivocationby a good lawyer and a reasonable , politic man . As if to say : If he will have neither honor nor dishonor , then , by Almighty God in heaven , we shall award @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or die with that . But here is a satirical touch which pleases Ralegh . In a twin/kling and a trice , all his spent life is brightened again with honor . As Christ on the Cross could , with a sentence , turn a thief into a saint , so with a few words Walter Ralegh could become a man of honor . He can leave Bess and Carew that legacy of honor , not given when he sought for it , earned when he had renounced it . As to the disgrace of his present condition , that is seemingly awarded too . But perhaps prematurely . For this  --  a man much to be pitied now  --  is within his power to build upon . Though honor is a castle in the clouds , it has been given to him and is his to do with as he pleases . He walks away to be a prisoner in the gatehouse of Westminster , possessing at this moment more freedom than he has had in years . He felt warmth , some gratitude toward Henry Yelverton . Therefore on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a servant 's crude walking stick . Perhaps it will bring Yelverton luck , too . He gave him a stout walking stick , feeling not so much that he did not need it as that Yelverton had forced him to walk out of the hall with all the swagger he could manage . He has enjoyed a triumph over men and their schemes . Enteredthe hall as a sick old man . Has left , and in time for dinner . Meanwhile , as Scripture says , a merry heart can work good medicine.  |p248For  I have been a soldier , a courtier , and a seafaringman . And the temptations of the least of these are able to overthrow a good mind and a good man . RALECH  --  Speech upon 29 October 1618p249Weather has turned foul . Pins and needles of rain . Wind sweeps across Old Palace Yard to beat on the tiny panes of the porter 's lodge . Where Ralegh has been placed in the upper chamber . Here he has more space and comfort than in either of the prisons which flank the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though neither of those is crowded now . For he saw not one face , heard not one call or jeer from the high , slit , barred windows as he came toward the gatehouse . Came knowing he would not lie upon damp straw in either of those places . For he still had a purse , with coins saved as a squirrel hoards nuts , against this day . And the porter would have occasion to supplement his meager wages , and such pennies and farthings as he can glean from other prisoners in his care , with gold . He was ready to rattle and ring that purse like village church bells at a Whitsun Ale . But the porter was prepared , having known of his own good fortune before the ink of the King 's signature had been powdered dry on the documents . Greeted Ralcgh like an innkeeper meeting a guest . Led thep250gentlemen all up to a large , low upper chamber , mumbling apologies for the accommodations . Which Ralegh saw at a glance were the best that could be arranged . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a fire on the hearth , having burned a good while , too , for the room was well warmed . And plenty of firewood and faggots . With the room clean and dusted . Best of all , an adequate bed . Not elegant , but comfortable enough . Where he lies now , dozing , in the hour after dinner and farewells to the officers and gentlemen who had joined him . Had decided , never mind expense and trouble , to do well by these guests . Even though this meant sending messengers and boys on errands as far as the city . The affable obsequious porter was prepared for that as well . The trestle table was soon set with pewter plates and knives and spoons , a side table displaying more pewter and earthenware . The porter announced he had two pieces of meat roasting and whiteflour bread fresh baked by his wife . Had two servants  --  perhaps hired from an inn , for they displayed some modest skill  --  for carving and serving and boys enough to form a choir , to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cask of good oysters and both sack and ale for the gentlemen while they waited . Ralegh rattled his purse and gave of it freely . More than the dinner and all arrangements might cost , though not so much as to satisfy the porter beyond future expectation or into a slovenly disregard . Enough to establish Ralegh was the master , though prisoner , and his keeper , a servant , not host . Enough to send the boys scurrying . Enough to furnish dinner for his guests . And , despite the rude chamber and common furnishings ,  |p251it  was a satisfactory dinner . Ample enough and with plenty remaining for the servants and hangbys and the porter 's larder . The wines were good and the gentlemen joined in his lightheartedness . Not a solemn word was said until farewell . Now alone , except for his brace of servants from the Tower , who arrived , somewhat sobered by cold rain , coming by cart with his chests , he is content to rest on the bed for an hour , no more , before he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Content to allow dinner to settle , the wine to clear from his head , and the weight of his heart to return . Resting quiet and easy alone as a man can be  --  in prison is the only privacy , they say  --  upon the shores of sleep . Time outside of time , the time of dreams when soul proves itself by leaving the body . He rests content . It is a time to summon up imaginary ghosts . He will not be angered by the presumption . From childhood he has known the common beliefs about the spirits of the dead . From a country childhood into the reign of a king who truly believes in ghosts and demons and witches , and not as merely preying upon the delusions of the poor and ignorant , but as the servants of the devil . The King 's beliefs , made public by his published writings , have given old follies new stature . And given more than one of his Court a cause for secret smiling . And given small comfort to common folk who share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen they had the solace of doubting , even while , out of the stubborn liberty of believing what they pleased , they clung to country myths as old as time . How the coming of death is bodied in the cry of an owl ,  |p252or  a raven 's croaking , or the howl of a wolf , long after none could recall the sound of a wolf in Devon . How  --  and they swore they had seen it  --  at the moment of death a pale flame appeared , dancing outside the window . Then danced away to the churchyard . And you must follow exactly the path of that flame when you marched with the corpse . Or the ghost would return to haunt you . Indeed ? Must follow the charted course of a dancing flame ? No doubt over walls , into wells and ponds and bogs , through haystacks and somebody 's bed chamber . Or are we permitted to go around these things ? And what of the fellow who permits no procession of mourners to tramp through his garden ? Ralegh has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn ringing of the passing bell in each church , by law , to the funeral wake . Which in the country has such abundance of ale and natural spirits as to make ghosts and wonders a probability . Has known great men who might have known better , to haunt their living heirs with wills calling for magnificent funerals , extravagant tombs , and splendid inscriptions and effigies , not noteworthy for lifelike portrayal of the dead . Designed in hope of fooling God as well as the devil . Knows the ways of ghosts . How they appear at midnight , in living form , and with substance no weapon can wound . How crowing of cocks will drive them back to churchyards . Which is why the cock crows all night on Christmas Eve . . . . Why , then , I think a fellow should have a cock that will crow upon command . And keep him ever on his shoulder like a talking bird or my lady 's pet squirrel . And what shall we do on a Christmas Eve when the cocks , ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and cry out cockadoodledooall night ? In wild Ireland has heard how the Irish can turn themselves into wolves . How Ireland is half populated with ghosts . Well , they fight like wolves and lay an ambush so stealthy a ghost might envy them . In the playhouse ghosts are more often seen than anywhere else . And why not ? It offers the designers and artificers a chance to demonstrate their craft . It presents an actor occasion to speak in a squeaky voice and to trouble to learn few lines . For ghosts are most particular to whom they speak and not known for wit and idle chatter . How you can speak to a ghost in Latin and even drive him away with its power . A good inducement for a lazy lad to study his Caesar , Virgil and Ovid . Though a clever lad may well ask what will happen if the ghost is some ill-educated lout who could not tell Latin from Welsh or the Canting Tongue ? Or is it that the very sound of it , recalling the miseries of school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wits ? And the Church has prayers for exorcism and its bell , book , and candle for cursing . Walk softly . Say only the Church must contend with many beliefs , and for the sake of the true faith show itself master over strange faiths . And Walter Ralegh has been rumored to be a sort of anatheistical necromancer . Keeping company with men like theEarl of Northumberland , Dr. John Dee , and Thomas Hariot . If study of mathematics and the motions of the stars , ofqualities of plants and herbs and minerals , all natural philoso/phy  --  is magic , then it is magic of God the Creator  --  if this is more outrageous than drawing a circle in sand to forbid the devil  --  a circle which will not keep out a mouse  --  so be it . At least fools will not dare disturb the privacy of study and experiment . In short , Walter Ralegh has not much interest in ghosts . Believing that this absence of interest is mutual . He stands upon the Father of Church Fathers , who said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " For when our spirits immortal shall be once separate from our mortal bodies and disposed by God , there remains in them no other joy of their posterity which does succeed than there does of pride in the stone which sleepeth in the wall of a king 's palace . Nor any other shame for their poverty than there does shame in that stone which bears up a beggar 's cottage . For ( as St. Augustinehas written ) : The dead , though holy , know nothing of the living . No , not even of their own children . For the souls of the departed are not conversant with the affairs of those who remain . ' " Time , while the old man dozes , to summon up ghosts , imagined and imaginary . Nameless except for their roles and stations . Perhaps he will not be offended if they are to be considered characters in the fashion of the types of Englishmen drawn by Sir Thomas Overbury . Who showed more wit in his book of Characters than he did in his appetite for sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghosts , since they are nameless and of no more dimension than figures in tapestry or stained cloth.  |p255If  therefore it be demanded whether the Macedonianor the Roman were the better warrior , I shall answer  --  the Englishman . For it will soon appear to any that shall examine the noble acts of our nation in war that they were performed by no advantage of weapon , against no savage or unmanly people ; the enemy being far superiorunto us in numbers and all needful provisions , yes , and as well trained as we , or commonly better , in the exercise of war . RALEGH-History of the Worldp256Scars on the soldier 's face are partly concealed by his beard . He hides stiffness of one leg by a slow , rolling swagger and , when he stands still , with a wide-footed solid stance . Come closer , note the fatness of lips , often split and healed . Wide flat nose and the little scars at his eyelids camouflaged by heavy brows and more at the corners , lost in a network of wrinkles . Heavy brows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now seem light and clear as water in sunlight , now dark and cold as wet stone . Clothes of rough cloth and several foreign fashions in one , but cut to fit him . Patched and shiny , but brushed neat and clean . Sword and dagger hung from a stout leather belt . Not shiny in dented scabbards , but smooth at the hilt and no fleck of rust from hilt to point . And point filed bright and edges honed keen . Sword and dagger as much a part of his body as his four limbs , fingers , and toes . For in service it would have cost him his life , by regulations , to go outdoors without them . Calls himself Captain now . Though more than once he hasp257carried all the weapons of the infantry . And served longest as sergeant . Knows more ways to lie than a Venetian , but can not be blamed when the world values any counterfeit above all sweaty , worn-smooth , hard-earned coins of truth . Patience and silence are not his guiding stars . Best let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heel , and vanishes . Speaks in a voice as rough as oak bark , and he alects a number of styles , high and low , whatever suits him , as the chameleon can change its coat to suit the leaf it lands on . Best give him his head . Let him head for the barn at his own pace and choosing the way . . . . Well , now , I 'll talk to you the same as I would to any man . Out of the pure milk of human kindness in me , I 'll allow as how you ca n't be as stupid and ignorant as you look . You can probably find your way to the privy and back without messing your clothes or getting lost . And if you ca n't , do n't expect me to draw you a chart or hold your hand . No matter what your mother told you , there are some things a man must do for himself . I 'll treat you with the same respect I would any green , whey-faced , knock-kneed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale-faced , weasel-eyed sneak of a rogue pressed out of prison to be a soldier . You 'll find me more fair and just than any justice of the peace . Treat me with respect and try no tricks , for I 've seen them all so many times I yawn at mention of them , and I 'll treat you the same . Which is more than you deserve.  |p258If  it gives you comfort , think on undeniable and unequivocal and immutable truth : the life of a soldier 's better than what you have ever had  --  and do n't tell me otherwise  --  or will have again . Enjoy it while you can  --  until some hairy bastard gives you what you 're good for . Which is the point of a pike straight up your arsehole . And when that happens , and it most likely will unless you 're a better man than you look , take consolation that you 're finally rid of me . Your immortal soul is free as a bird . I claim no power there . Ask the company preacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your soul belongs to the preacher and God . It 's the skin of your ass that 's all mine . . . . A mere demonstration , sir , no offense meant . To prove you my first point . Which is plain enough . All soldiering 's the same . Though I 've never had time or inclination to read Ralegh 's History , I do n't need a book to make my points . Has there ever been any man on the face of the earth , since Cain and Abel  --  which is far enough back to begin , you 'll agree ?  --  in any country whatsoever , any climate or age of time , who has not had to imagine his life and death as a soldier ? Peace is so high prized because there 's damn little of it . In truth there is none and never has been . Not since we were drummed out of Eden . Even in peacetime there 's always murder and war in men 's hearts . Add up the number who have lived the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I did n't believe inghosts , I would n't be talking to you now , would I ?  --  fromp259all the wars and causes , hover over our heads . Look around you , and odds are favorable you 'll find some of the maimed and the crippled and scarred . And many more , though masked in health , unmarked and whole , who are as inward wounded as any with scars to show . Weigh it a moment , and you 'll agree that when it comes to the life of a soldier , you possess all necessary knowledge of it at your fingertips . Even killing has not changed much since Cain . One way is much the same as the other . And there 's no good way to die . Except in your sleep in a feather bed . Agreed ? So I say you 'll have no sweating and straining to imagine any soldier who ever lived . But any who have been soldiers know it is imagining more than fear , which will come when it comes anyway , that turns the guts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life out of him quicker than a musket ball between the eyes . And so to endure , to live until he dies , a soldier must learn to live , as much as he 's able , here and now . No thought of the sufficient evil of yesterday or regrets for the good of it . No wincing for the wounds and pains of tomorrow . Take away a man 's past and his future and he 's left with the present . And then it seems the whole of Creation has been treated with a coat of paint . To be a good soldier is to be drunk on what 's here  --  a pair of dry socks , birdcalls from a bush , clear water , a bottle of wine , the body of a woman . No wonder you ca n't trust any old soldier . I include myself in the proposition . For if he lives to be old , he will look back to even the worst times as good , when all things were naked and simple.  |p260Those  who have never known that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time , injustice , rage , fear , and horror . Can imagine everything  --  except what it is to be a soldier . Here 's a prime example : Item . The world with all its history , knowledge , and contrary evidence , has always believed that men fight and die best for a good cause and do not die well in the service of wickedness . Allow me  --  and any old soldiers who may be listening  --  to laugh out loud . The cause for being where he is , that 's the first thing a soldier discards to lighten his marching load . His only cause is to live as long as he can . And sometimes he must fight very well for that cause . Soldiers know there was , is , never shall be any cause or purpose worth dying for . They die when they have to and as well as they can . And that 's the first secret of the soldier 's craft . All wars and fights are the same and all soldiers the same . Agreed ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . But , war or peace , his fighting times are few and far between . Every soldier , living or dead , is blood kin to every other in the experience of fighting . But by the same rule , every soldier is single and unique . For the life of a soldier is most a matter of what he has eaten , pleasure or pain of his boots and uniform , the weight and quality of his gear . So , while saluting you as a brother at arms , I am entitled to say and bound to believe that if you have never trailed a pike , then you do n't know your arse from a kettle bottom.  |p261Do  you follow me this far ? God 's blood and sweat you ought to ! You want to know some things about being a soldier . Well , you have come to a man who can tell you . There are many around and about  --  I will mention no names  --  who would tell you a Jordan pot full of lies . If that 's what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatter no man  --  unless he has a dagger 's point at my throat . In which case I 'll fawn like a puppy dog . At least until I have gained an advantage of him . At which time , sir , though he lick my boots till they shine like brass , and he swear I am the Hector of the English , though he offer me money and use of his wife and daughters , I shall have his heart parboiled and served upon a treen platter and feed the rest of him from a bucket to my hogs . I 'm a kind-hearted man . But I would be no man at all if I had lived by less than my full wit and for more return upon my investments than eye for an eye . There 's many a man who needs schooling . I count you amongthem . So , head up , eyes front , pay attention and listen well . If you have anything to ask or say , you shall have your chance . We now have a season of peacetime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gatehouse . Peace ever since , in1604 , the King and his clever little man , Robert Cecil , settledthe war with Spain . Fourteen years for what it may be worth . A long time in the history of this nation or any I know of . Making peace between England and Spain , that was KingJames ' first purpose when he came to the throne . All his life the King has been strong for peace . And no wonder , withScotland so often torn by risings and wars among the lairds , with Scotland , alone , a short march and an easy campaign forp262the English when they had a mind and a reason to fight . To survive he had to bolster himself with alliances , in truth and illusion , with France and Spain , especially Spain . Fearing war so much , and hating it too  --  though never a soldier himself , fearing and hating from hard experience  --  he deemed he could know power when he saw it . On paper , that is . Power of the Spanish Army , power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He added the sum of that power and trembled . He weighed that power against what he knew of English strength and shuddered at the thought of what would become of us . It was said , when the Armada came against us in ' 88 , that , once the Spaniard had cleared the British Sea and put their army from the Netherlands ashore , down would come James with an army from Scotland to finish us off and take the throne . And that might have happened except that the winds and the sea made slops of the Spanish strategy . Do you know what the Queen did then , sir ? On the face of it , it 's hard to believe . From her spies  --  best in the world and worth ten thousand men in the field  --  she knew what James was thinking . So the Queen did what he least expected . She withdrew all but a token force , a few guards , from the only garrison on the Scots border at Berwick . And she sent the musters from the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North an open door to the Scots if they came . No doubt James took her to be a lunatic woman , crazed with unwarranted confidence ; but however he took it , he did not move against us . Because , to him , it might have been a trap . Supposing she knew something he did not . Supposing she was not crazed with fear or arrogance either .. . . If the Spaniards failed  --  as they did  --  he would be caught atp263war with England , would lose his army , likely his kingdom , maybe his life , and for certain any chance to gain the throne . He could only fret and wait . When the Armada came to nothing , he could breathe easy at first , conceiving himself wise in his fearful delay . Then later he learned the truth of it  --  how it was not the English , by land or sea , who dispersed the power of Spain , but bad fortune and bad weather ; and he knew that the failure of the Armada was not the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and resolution , new fleets can be built , new men mustered ; how he had been tricked by a woman and had failed in all things ; how he now had ruined the chance of an open alliance with Spain , for all the succor he could offer was to fish out some few half-drowned Spanish seamen and send them safe home . After that and in the years that followed until the Queen died , all he could do was to pray for the fortunes of the foolish English and hope that when he was their King  --  if he were to gain the throne  --  he could find a way to make peace with Spain . Robert Cecil , who could make a treaty with the devil , did it for him . No wonder , though , when you think on it , Ralegh was a thorn in his side . And Ralegh did not ease his fears by offering the King , on his arrival into England , powerful arguments against peace and all for more war with Spain . . . . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Too long a time to be true , if you ask me . More of a calm than a peace . A stagnant calm with wind and weather building black castles all around the sky . A peace which only a fool can imagine will be prolonged forever . But let me speak of the times before , when there was no peace worth mentioning , in the reign of the late Queen.  |p264When  Queen Elizabeth came to the throne in ' 58 , lucky to have a head on her shoulders to put a crown on , she came to rule in a kingdom as ringed with troubles as the seas around us . Beset , too , with dangers within . Under King Edward there had been rebellions in ' 49 , Kett 's Rebellion , and the Western Rising . Put down , true enough , and in bloody battles . But the backbone of the King 's forces were mercenary soldiers from foreign countries . Well-trained in killing and more than a match for our yeomen . Though , please to remember , those yeomen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days . Soon after came Queen Mary , whom some call the Spanish Tudor and some Bloody Mary . Her aim was peace abroad and surety at home  --  aim of all princes . She failed in both by the end . Surety at home ... . Her reign commenced with doubt and with rebellion . Lady Jane Grey named Queen in the Tower . Which for nine days served her as palace , and for the rest of her days as home . Anyway she was spared the inconvenience in the moving of bag and baggage . No great shakes of war there , but making the throne of England a shaky chair to sit upon . And soon as she was settled enough to marry the Spanish King , Philip , troubles were real enough . They were able to nip in the bud a large stratagem which would have overturned her easy enough . For only one small part of that plot , the rising in Kent under Wyatt , came as close as the thickness of Ludgate to victory . The long and the short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , two hundred of the Guard and six hundredp265whitecoats of London city bands and a couple of companies of loyal Kentish men . When the time to fight came , the Queen 's forces went over to Wyatt . And their commander , the Duke of Norfolk , rode away to save his life , leaving a litter of his armor behind . On toward London comes Wyatt and , before he enters Southwark , the last of the Queen 's Guard are already close to mutiny . True to her blood , the Queen goes down to the Guildhall of the city . Makes her plea and makes many promises . London stands with her , the gates are closed , and the bands mustered . Then much confusion , false rumors , tricks , and counters . A little fighting and Wyatt yields . Now , unlike your sleeping Ralegh there , I have never stood guard beside a Queen . Never so much as entered a presence chamber . I know nothing of these things . But I know a little of leading fractious men . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of other nations . When a mutiny 's spent or crushed , there 's only one choice to be made . The man in command can come down like Jehovah upon Gomorrah . Fire and brimstone and holy terror . And I 've seen that done and work for a time . But now , sir , that leader has spent his choice forever . Must therefore continue to maintain authority by terror . Must thereafter , unless he 's a fool , live in fear that the same will happen again . By hard experience I learned to take another choice . Justicefor a few of the worst malefactors , mercy for all the others . And some consideration of the causes . Which , if they cannotbe cured , can be blunted by a willingness to try . Do you see ? Under Philip and Mary we had our time of Spanish discipline . And cruelty , too , for we were likewise enemies . Butp266not so much of either as to leave us as we did Munster in Ireland . Too short a time before Queen Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decay . We lost Calais , our stronghold in France  --  whose gates for two centuries carried the inscription : " Then shall the Frenchman Calais win/ When iron and lead like cork shall swin. "  --  in a siege of a week . Queen Elizabeth came to the throne with the kingdom poor , wounded within , and with more danger from enemies abroad than ever before . Scotland on the border , hostile and suspicious , close kin to France . Ireland hostile , in open rebellion , and , truly , never having been subdued . Ireland close kin to Spain . Neither France nor Spain friendly , each a threat and togetheroverwhelming . And what was her power ? Her Guard and pensioners , the file of warders at the Tower , some crumbling garrisons of soldiers , few in number , mostly at Berwick and Dover . And the militia , men of the musters of counties and cities . And these having chiefly proved they could rise up and work mischief . The walls and cities with their fortifications and the old strongpoints were useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , small as it had been , having wasted and declinedfurther . Say , then , that she began her reign with no power at all . Now , that can be reduced to the bare-shank terms that acommon soldier can understand . From the beginning , outnumberedand outgunned everywhere , she could take only onep267tactic  --  delay . A soldier might surrender , gambling on his life . But surrender of a nation ends its life . I believe the Queen at heart was a good English captain . Of all her generals and marshals of armies , there was n't any , except the last one , Charles Blount , the Lord Mountjoy , worth the tailfeathers off an Irish crow . Call the roll of pompous fools , who could kill more men by ignorance , folly , and rash stupidity than plague and famine together , and scratch your head to recollect a victory by any of them : William Grey , Lord Grey ; Robert Dudley , Earl of Leicester ; Henry Carey , Lord Hunsdon ; Edward de Fiennes , Lord Clinton ; Thomas Radcliffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Ambrose Dudley , Earl of Warwick ; Robert Devereux , Earl of Essex ; Sir Henry Bagenal ; Sir Francis Vere ; Sir John Norreys , and some others whose names even I , mercifully , have clean forgotten . Masters of proud musters , and able to present a procession of troops marching out and away in time to the beat of the drum . They were also mighty skilled in arranging that armies would not have an excess of food to waste upon themselves , nor too much powder and shot to injure the enemy , nor such regular payment as to make their purses heavy . Those soldiers who , by luck and by God , escaped the fevers and starvation , were given occasion to escape this mortal coil , this wicked world , by being sent out upon ill-conceived skirmishes and impossible assaults . Christ , is it any wonder she hastened first to repair the tiltyardsof her palaces and castles ? So these men could play at war and hurt only each other . Let them throw snot about , by which I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Zutphen , but waste no tears for many thousands gone.  |p268Take  Essex , who had every chance to prove his mettle matched his mouthing . At Cadiz he raced ahead of everyone to scale the wall and got stuck there while others smashed the gates and entered the town . At Lisbon he stood before the fortress and issued the old-fashioned challenge for single combatwith their champion . And shook his fist at answering laughter from the walls . He never served so low as a captain . Had small use for captains and none for common soldiers , whom he called artificers and clowns who apprehend nothing but what they see before them . Well , sir , there are many sorts of clowns . Give me one who sees what 's in front of his eyes instead of that clown with a general 's baton who sees Agincourt wherever he is . The Queen was our captain . But when the time came we most needed a general , she was there . The English Army at Tilbury never had to fight . And that 's the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show when she donned silver armor in ' 88 , while the Armada was still in the sea , and rode bareheaded , jewels in her hair , on a white horse before the troops at Tilbury . And there was hard sense in her words to them . " I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman , but I have the heart and stomach of a king , and King of England too , and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain , or any prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm ; to which , rather than any dishonor shall grow by me , I myself will take up arms . I myself will be your general , judge , and rewarded of every one of your virtues in the field . " Our little wars were in Scotland and Ireland , in France and in Spain and Portugal , in bits and pieces , and scattered across years.  |p269Many  musters and alarms in England . Some , I think , to practice the business of mustering and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one at home that might be truly called war  --  the rising of the Northern Earls in ' 69 . A sad , foolish , vainglorious affair , settled between October and Christmas , in that miserable country up beyond the Trent , all pasture and moor , forest , bogs , and rock-strewn uplands . Old castles and poor crumbling towns . The earls in their old armor and lacking artillery , raising much dust , but accomplishing little . It was settled for good by musters from the South . Who picked them as clean as the Spaniards would have . And when the dust settled , we hanged more men by martial law than we killed in the fighting . Many  --  Essex for one  --  were strong pleaders for a standing Army , like other nations . Something secure for the soldier . And men well trained , not clumsy farm boys who must be taught and blooded anew each time . And they argued that already there were too many rogues and vagabonds about , masterless men ; and the poor , cast out of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by enclosures , wandering the roads , suffering themselves and causing mischief to others . When you add to this the number of men from armies , dischargedand sent home to shift for themselves , there was even more danger . Men with nothing to show for their service but scars and the holes in their clothes and shoes . Men who had skill in use of weapons and the habit of using them . But truth is standing armies cause more danger . Spain , with the largest and proudest of armies , had many desertions and mutinies . Witness the Fury of Antwerp in ' 76 , when the King of Spain could not pay his men.  |p270Better  separate vagabonds in England than battalions and regiments of them . And it was either too late or too early for England to forge a fighting Army . In Europe , where land wars took place , they were ahead of us in equipment and tactics . We still had fools extolling the virtues of longbow against arquebus , musket , and caliver ; who believed armor was manly and useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thrust from a rapier . Some thought of using mercenary soldiers . All other nations , from France to far Turkey , had mercenaries . But we had seen them here in England . They were hated here , and are always dangerous and costly . We have used them sometimes in Europe , but not with much success . On the other hand , it was useful to have Englishmen serving as mercenaries for others . Those who wished to could fight elsewhereat the expense of someone else . If they lived to return , they could become what we lacked  --  veterans around which an Army can always be made . So Englishmen fought in all the wars , and often on both sides . From these came our veterans and captains , including myself . And if we could not whip green mustered boys into such shape as to match Spanish foot or German light horse , why , we could put the fear of God into them and lead them as well as men can be led . You should know , too , something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a green , but drilled soldier has an edge of advantage over the veteran . The fear of the green soldier can serve to advantage . He will obey commands in faith and go careful , by the book . He fears , but does not yet know how much he has to fear . Your old soldier knows allp271dangers and has long since concluded his life is a matter of luck . Has no faith in commanders . He may break and run if he feels he 's lost the last of his luck . Or he may become careless , a ghost of a man , whose only safety , he conceives , is that he has shrugged off his life in advance . We had captains , who had been to other wars , to lead companiesin ours . Some , I am sad to report , took time out to write books . When every country gent who 's trooped a line at a muster can publish the final word on the art of fighting , my view is the ones that know should ignore books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and be done with the subject . One is Sir Roger Williams . Now , Williams was a Welshman , a hardass weasel with a head like a dented burgonet . Was as bitter and sharp as a pulled leek with earth still clinging to it . Sour as last season 's cider . He was half outrage and the other half pure exasperation . But he saw a lot of service in his time . Fought in the Netherlandsfor Spain , for the States , and even , at last , for the English . Was at Tilbury when the Armada came . Made the voyage to Portugal and back . In the nineties served in France . Commandedthe port of Dieppe and greeted Essex when the Earl landed there with his men . I have my doubts he was ever in Scotland or Ireland , but I ca n't be sure . When I knew him , he had seen and suffered so much folly that nothing would ever surprise him again . Except , perhaps , an example of common sense . Drank too much and loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Allowed himselfonly few occasions to lie . And he was tough as a bear and intended to keep alive as long as he could . You couldp272call him a good captain to follow unless a better one came along . The other I call to mind wrote more words than many a poet and fancied himself the supreme scholar of war . Sir John Smythe , all blood and iron , iron of his armor and blood of our wounds ! Praise be , he never was a general . He had the makings for that . But he wrote himself out of all chances . Might have known better . Saw his first action and killing in ' 49 , fighting against rebels of Kett 's Rebellion , and in the Western Rising . On the Continent saw more battles and warfarethan most , as far away as Hungary and Turkey . But always with books , Caesar and Sallust , handy . Came back to England to make a name for himself . As in ' 87 he was to assist in the muster of Essex and Hertford . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " the order of marching of a semicircle of two ranks oblique according to the Hungarian and Turkey manner . " At Tilbury he was a bleeding colonel . Captain General Leicesterfound him amusing until the day he inspected Smythe 's troops . Of which the Earl reported : " After the muster , he entered into such strange cries for ordering of men and for fight with the weapon as made me think he was not well . God forbid he should have charge of men who know as little as I dare pronounce he does . " Leicester relieved him and sent him home to write more books . Smythe discovered the English longbow . It must have been new to him . The Council was eager to keep archery alive . It was a matter of statute . Not for warfare , mind you , but for general health and welfare and to discourage folks from less healthy ways of spending leisure ; and to keep our Englishp273craftsmen , the bow makers , from starving . But Smythe had to attack the Privy Council on such subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adding his groatsworth of opinion on the subject of the recent failures of the English Army , and , especially , the Earl of Leicester 's expedition to the Netherlands . His book was suppressed and he was fined . In ' 96 he found his hard head in the Tower . For , two days drunk , he came to a muster in Essex and tried to lead a rising . Lucky for him , he was too drunk to be understood and fell from his saddle . He never ceased offering advice to Council and anyone he could collar in an alehouse . Smythe was one of the best of the pudding-headed fools . He died poor enough . Even had to pawn his armor . But the best of that kind will get you killed or leave you one-legged or crippled to prove that Euclid or Pythagoras were right or wrong ; and shipped home to beg at the edge of towns and fairs , wrapped in bandages like a babe in swaddling . Leaningon a stick like a stork on one leg . Christ on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the sod of half the world grow greener over bones of Englishmen . Smythe , that windy fart , he was a mighty scholar when it comes to vanwards and rearwards , sleeves and wings and forlornhopes , trenches with half-rounds indents , traverses , quadrants and angles of fire . But , do you know , he barely touches on the subject of the siege ? The siege , that 's half of warfare . Digging and sweating and waiting . I 've got the calluses to prove a soldier 's got more use for a pick and shovel than a pike.  |p274Any  damn fool can see at a glance that the captain is the key to the English Army . Now , many a man who 's served his time will tell you hairraisingtales of captains . I 've heard them all myself more than once . And there were some bad ones just as the world always has room for wicked scroyles . Otherwise how would we know virtue when we meet it ? Do you see ? But seeing I 've served as a captain myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my fellows . Ask yourself this : why would a man want to be a soldier ? Never mind musters and press gangs and such . There are ways to avoid them . Once bitten may not be the beginning of wisdom , but it teaches a man something about dogs . And a soldier can always run away and many did that too . There were times when even I , myself , took leave on my own . I 'll admit it . My four limbs and the head on my shoulders are proof of it . When Gabriel sounds his trumpet , I can report to that final muster all in one piece and wo n't have to hunt all over half of Europe and Ireland for leftovers . I 'm sorry for the ones who will , but that 's their medicine to swallow , not mine . But why would a sane man ever choose to be a soldier ? No future in it , sir , no future at all . Exactly . . . . But a soldier has no future and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any schoolmaster could ask , he is n't thinking of a future at all . Hard as it can often be , the life of a soldier can also be merry . There are times when he 's in good health and out of danger , when his clothes are clean and dry and the rations are good , when women are free with favors and wine and ale are strong and cheap , when his luck is running with cards and dice . Times when a soldier can laugh at the plowboy stumbling behind a plow and the prentice fumbling to learnp275a craft . Times when gentlemen , merchants , lords , seem like clowns of Fortune with so much to regret and fret over . And a man who farms his own plot of land can starve to death on it or work a lifetime and lose it . Nobody starves a soldier on purpose . And if he 's got half wit he need n't starve anywhere I know of . Except in Ireland , where starving is the way of life . A soldier has nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to know as long as he can believe it . Back to the captain . He wears a different pair of shoes . He is least likely to be killed and , further , can fix the odds in his favor . He has to think somewhat of the future , and if he thinks it through , he 'll see it 's a shabby one . Lucky the captain who ends his service with enough in his purse to give him a decent old age . He makes do with dead pays and a muster roll that lists dead men and deserters as alive and on duty . He 's a merchant when it comes to the buying and selling of provisions and clothing . And some , not of the best , have been tempted to deal with the enemy . Especially in Ireland , where the kerns and gallow glasses would give all they had for an ordinary English arquebus . What harm ? Say the arquebus of a dead man . It 's no use to him now . Better for someone to have it than rusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to feed it with powder and shot . And sooner or later he 'll get one anyhowoff a corpse . He 'll kill for it . Why not save a life and make a profit at the same time ? Not that I engaged in such traffic myself , of course . You have my word on it . But there 's a check on how far a foolish or wicked captain can go . His company will stand for only so much . And therep276are more ways of disposing of a captain than mutiny . The captain knows this better than the men . There is always a chance that a captain doing well enough may find one foot on the ladder of preferment . There are many examples of that  --  Ralegh , for one . For a man with no fortune and small future , there 's not much to lose and always at least a chance of a change for the better . . . . It is true we had a good issue of uniform , all in all . But the use and comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been adequate for England . But in France and Portugal we sweated and fainted from heat . Dutch cold stiffened our joints and shivered us to the bone . In Irelandwe might as well have been swimmers in wet air . In Scotland , where God has turned his back and witches dance bareass with the devil , if the cold does not kill you , you 'll drown in the damp . The wet is worst , for English cloth will shrink around your frame . Picture a march of a dozen miles , a fair day 's march , in the rain and mud , clothes as heavy as armor . Then the sun comes out for a peep , long enough to dry us , and everything shrinks to fit as tight as a new glove . In Ireland our clothes were rags in no time . Shoes of English leather rotted away , and everything metal rusted . I doubt that St. Patrick had trouble persuading the snakes to leave . No trick to that . Birds and beasts are scarce enough , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a piece of cowhide , men and women alike , eating grass and leaves and nuts off the ground . We wore Irish brogues and breeches when we could findp277them . Even if it meant sending some Irishman on his way barefootand baldass . Ireland was the hardest service with nothing worth stealing and even our friends could n't feed us full . The weather was misery , winter or summer . And no proper war at all , but an ambush here on the road , a skirmish there at a ford , or a cattle raid . The drums would call To Arms and To March and away we 'd go through mud a goose would disdain and rocks that would take the breath of a goat . To catch a few , hang them , bring back some heads on the ends of pikes . No beginning and no end to it , with nothing improving no matter what we did , or if we did nothing . It had a beginning for the soldier , though : a puking voyage on a stinking ship , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul straw to sleep on if you could sleep ; and all that to remember , to endure again if and when your time was up . A wet , dirty , bloody war where you would never learn which was your enemy and who was a friend , if they knew themselves . And the least you 'd get out of it was Irish ague for life . That was a school that taught a man nothing but declensions of misery and prepared him for nothing except the pains of hell . But hell 's bells and the devil 's clanging balls ! That was not all the truth . For even in this telling , I can recall good times . Men have said your Irishman is a savage . I have heard ( in one ear and out the other ) preachers tell why . The Irish are a lost and outcast tribe of Israel . Sometimes they are the last of the branded offspring of Cain , etc . And I have heard tavernp278tales of old mariners , who will tell you that the black African or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts an Irishman to shame . Well , I know less of Holy Scripture than I should and believe less than I admit . I would n't waste a small fart in a high wind worrying where the Irish came from . And though I have seen both black and red in London , I 've never yet been to Africa or the New World . All I can say is I doubt I would have been any different if I had been born an Irishman . And I 'll say the same for you . After all 's said and done . . . . And why not say it ? The Irish are cunning and treacherous , cowardly and cruel when it suits them , lazy and idle , ignorant and dirty , arrogant and proud , and all crazed  --  a nation of Abraham men . But they can be as brave as any who ever lived . And when it suits them they can be as free and generous as if they own the world to the horizon and have never heard of tomorrow . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the clink in Southwark , rail against their rude shamrock manners . Curse dirty oatcakes and sour milk and lice as thick as the freckles of Sir Francis Drake . They 'll tell you how the ignorant Irish still plow by the tail and sleep bare naked by the fire , toasting first one side and then the other . They 'll tell of dirt and stink and how one Irishman clings to more foolish country beliefs  --  of haunts and faeries and spirits and such  --  than all the Welsh and Scotch put together . They 'll tell you , too , how an Irishman will explode in blackfaced choler and draw knife against you if you fart in front of him , lacking even the first understanding of civil behavior . I confess this last is true and I do n't understand it at all.  |p279But  farting does enrage them , and so it 's best to humor them . Hold it if you can . Walk away if you ca n't . Not an Englishman , though , unless he is a liar to the marrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's courageous . He can live on roots and grass and march for miles and make a stand and fight to the last and never cry quarter or mercy . More than once when I was a captain there , I found myself at the feast of some seneschal . All served outdoors at a log table or on the ground . And devil take weather , wind or rain . For a feast they 'll eat the last cow they own . And once you are accustomed , you can learn to hunger for their food . It warms both heart and bowels . It sticks to the ribs . A chunk of butter with oatmeal and fresh blood and plenty of meat . They wo n't touch fish or wildfowl even when there 's plenty of both . Some Englishmen can not swallow meat of a beast that 's been skinned and cooked in its own hide , sewn up and strung over a hot fire . It 's a different taste , true , but savory with juices . Best of all and the finest medicine against cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Drink it straight and full like ale , or mix it with a little milk , and you 'll fear not the devil or any man alive . And before the feast is done you 'll be drunker than Noah and will see the whole world in pairs as he did . At a feast there would be singing and dancing . Always boys playing pipes to match the piping of your blood . And a poet with an Irish harp at the last . To sing old stories and sorrows while everyone keeps silence and beards glisten with tears like raindrops in a holly bush . On the morrow they may slip six inches of steel betweenyour ribs . But at an Irish feast a man can believe in brotherhood . Will you believe this ? When I was mustered out the lastp280time , home from France , I offered myself as a common soldier . I would have carried arquebus for eight pence a day , to get back to Ireland . It was n't just fighting or feasting either . There is something about an Irish woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale at bargain price . There are always women where soldiers are . And we all know , being sons of Adam , that there 's none of it a man can ignore and pass by except at the price of regret . A Bishop in a bush is pure pleasure in any language , call it what you will . An Irish woman has something different and pleasing beyond all the others . I never saw such comely sturdy flesh  --  even on the poor . With their long dark hair and their color all over , head to toe , of fresh cream . And something wild as a witch about them , sparks of hell in their eyes . She may join you in a feather bed or behind a hedge  --  all the same to her  --  and for no price at all save the joy of it . And never ask your name or tell you hers . Once I was riding alone , carrying a message through forlorn lonesome country . Cold wind blowing and rain falling steady . I lost the trail and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up more fierce , rain in my eyes , dark coming on and no recollection of north and south . Not a tree or a bush for miles , it seemed , or even a rock for shelter . I came over a rise and there below was one of those round stone towers they like to live in . A fenced yard with wet cattle standing . Light from ports of the tower and the top of the tower smoking like a chimney . Not a soul in sight and no man challenged me . I kept my hand on the hilt of my sword and would not unsaddle , though I fed my mare some oats . Rain was coming down harder and not a star in the sky orp281the memory of a moon . I was as wet as a flounder and cold as a cod . So there was nothing else but to hike back my shoulders and go up to the door and rap my knuckles black and blue against it . After a time I heard bolts squeaking loose . I gripped the hilt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a run for the mare . The door swung in and there in the light was a woman , not much more than a girl , standing there smiling at me . She was wearing a shift that came down to her knees , a thin shift as soft as a bandage . And the light behind revealed all secrets . Before I could say a word , she beckoned me to come , and I stepped in and she slammed the door to and shot the bolts home again . She motioned to follow and I followed her up a creaky circle of stairs to the top . Where she opened a door and we came into a round hall with a fire burning and smoking in the middle and the rain from the smoke hole spittinginto the fire . And there around the fire , as white and rosy as angels , were nine more like her , of divers shapes and sizes and all dressed the same . They stood up and smiled and I smiled too . Then a young man came in , a comely lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest for the night . For a moment I would not trust my eyes , for there he stood , all smiling and polite , a gentleman to be sure , and as naked as a newborn babe . I mumbled gratitude and he spoke to the women in the Irish tongue . And they laughed and ran to me and seized me like a prisoner . I wrestled and they wrestled back and he told me they meant no harm , only to take my clothes to dry . Andp282take them they did , every last stitch , and laid them near the fire . Then two of them rubbed me dry with a soft cloth and another brought me a wooden bowl of Irish spirits and one to my host . He nodded and raised it and drank it down in a swallow or two and I followed suit . And then here was another one , full to the brim , handed to me . The women took carpets from a chest and spread them in a ring around the fire . The young man motioned me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of their shifts and came and lay down too . Astonished I was , to be sure , and suspicious as well . But not completely defenseless ; for the dagger at the fork of my legs was well nigh a pike by that time . Which seemed to amuse them all a great deal . They brought some bread and cheese and more usquebaugh . And we lay on soft carpets and toasted ourselves pink on both sides till the fire began to dwindle and the hall to darken and we had to huddle close to warm each other . I kept warm enough that night , I 'll tell you . And , neither asleep nor awake , I did my duty as an Englishman . Until I conceived it might be a cunning plot to kill me with excess . Then I shrugged my shoulders and I thought to myself : If it is a plot for murder , they will find this victim cheerful and willing to the last breath . And if I die let me go , Lord , to the Turkish heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitten , I set out following directionsthey gave me . The sun was shining and the day was fair . My host bade me stay on for more hospitality . And when ( damn fool ! ) I said I could not , he told me I would be welcome any time . I confess as soon as I was able I set out to find that place again . But there had been raids and fighting in all that section.  |p283I  never found the tower , though there were ruins that could have marked the spot . One night like that in a lifetime , sir , is worth one thousand nights with a nagging wife in a thatched cottage with all comforts . And I reckon it 's worth all the trouble of being a soldier , too .... But I see you are impatient . You did not imagine me out of the darkness to hear the chronicle of my life or my privy opinions . It is Walter Ralegh you are seeking . He eludes you as he lies there snoozing . You say half asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , but he sleeps like a soldier or a cat . Light enough for a change in the wind or the dying of a fire or another man 's snoring  --  if the other be a sentinel on the watch  --  to wake him as quick as lightning and thunder . The old saying goes : A captain must not sleep a full whole night . Rightly so , for Walter Ralegh is a soldier . And if he saw no future in soldiering and left it , do not forget that he found a future by soldiering . But he was a special kind of a soldier . I do not mean your candy soldier out of London and Westminster . Nor your tavern bully or brawling courtier , ready to cross swords over a slight ; though record shows he did not fear a tavern brawl with rowdies or a duel with a swordsman either . It shows , too , he sought neither brawls nor duels . In truth  --  read his own words , sir , and match them with and against what you know  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was not easily provoked into quarrels of that kind . Need I tell you  --  for surely the world in its age has notp284grown so ignorant of the nature and humors of man  --  that because he was not quick to fight he was the greater challenge ? And that sooner or later , especially when he was young , he would be pushed into a wall with his back to it , and then would fight as well as any . To a soldier a sword is not a toy or a decoration . When he draws sword , he means to kill with it and stands ready to be killed . Another mark against Ralegh from the beginning in the ledger book of King James . The world knows he will not permit an unsheathed blade , sword or dagger , in his presence . Knows , too , the padded bulk of the King 's clothing comes from the heavy sort of waistcoat , leather and links , he wears always next to his skin . ' T is said to be proof against any blade or pistol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blades began in his mother 's womb , for she was large with him when his father and a band of the lairds took swords and daggers to David Rizzio , her secretary  --  and some say her lover  --  directly before her eyes . And he was a child when he saw his uncle sliced to fillets in swordplay . His life was in close danger many times in that land where even the noblemenare cutthroat ruffians . We now celebrate as a holiday his deliverance from the hands of Gowrie . Lord , no wonder he fears brawling and blades ! No wonder he feared Ralegh , swordsman for the Queen , her Captain ever ready to kill in a moment or at a sign . No surprise he would believe that Ralegh conspired against him in ' 03 and that Ralegh was chosen to carve up the King , his Queen and all the children . . . . Ralegh was a soldier but not a kitchen garden sort of soldier . Was off to France first , a boy , in a gentleman 's troop of horsep285from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-to -- do . And himself with a name , a horse , his trooper 's gear , and not much else . An ordinary horse soldier , then , with not a pisspot to call his own and to fear to lose . A difference from many another young gentleman . Starting not an ensign bearer with eyes up on a captaincy . Beginning in ignorance and innocence . No doubt he was trained in use of his weapons and a good horseman too . He would not have been there otherwise . And no doubt he must have heard many a story from old fellows much like me . He had kinsmen who had ventured far to fight the Turk . They would tell him what they could . But all that is nothing until you take the knowledge to you like a woman . There is no training known can ready a man for his first time in battle . When someone , near or far , seen or unseen , is carefully trying to kill  --  him . A man is never the same after that dawning . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the lost innocence , as he is by the naked ambush of truth . If he lives through that first encounter , he 's a soldier then , for better or worse . Whatever he was before is dead and gone . Now , the way they used horse was to support the infantry . No more charges as of old . Horsemen worked as wings of the infantry , guarding flanks on the march and in battle . And they served as the Forlorn Hope , working ahead in the point and behind in retreat as a screen . And they scouted and skirmished and set up ambushes . And they reconnoitered and carried dispatchesand messages . It was lonesome duty , liable to be deadly any time . Their chief enemy would be the enemy 's horse soldiers , up to the same things . Killing was done with pistols and caliver or , when thick and close together , with bare swords . Two groups ofp286men must come close to deliver fire , each close enough for the other to hit them . Pistols fired at fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismounted . Not blocks of men in mob and melee , confusion of shot and shell , with screams and cries and drums beating the orders . But meeting a face you can see and remember . Cool craft of murder required . Ralegh learned with dispatch or he would not have lived long enough to matter . And all the while he soldiered like any other , except that a horseman has more to worry about : his mount , whose health is his own , and woe to the man who loses a mount . It was custom to degrade him down to the pick and shovel pioneers . Then all that saddle and bridle and gear to care for . And finding food for two . All this in a strange country in the service of a foreign Army nearly as hostile as the enemy . And all in a war of religion . Which is the worst kind . For then there is no cruelty . That it can not be justified . The boy who went as a horseman to fight in those wars received an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't kill him or cure him , was likely to last . Proof of which comes later when he went to Ireland as a captain of infantry . You know some of the stories from that time . How once alone he held off a seneschal and twenty men with a pistol at the edge of a ford to rescue a comrade who had fallen off horse in the stream . Risking , wagering neither the seneschal nor any of his horsemen would volunteer to be the one man killed by his pistol . A good cavalry wager . . . . How once when an English army was on the march , he hidp287his company and remained behind when camp broke to march on . Waiting until the Irish appeared to poke in the ashes of campfires , to scavenge for what they could find . Ambushed them there , in their own style of warfare . Took prisoners . One of them carrying a bunch of willow withies . Captain Ralegh asks him what they are for . " To hang English churls , " he replies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will serve as well for an Irish kern . " And orders the fellow hanged with his own withies from the nearest branch . A soldier 's sense of jest . Without false pity or imaginary fear . How he marched his company all night across hostile countrysideand captured a town and seized the castle by a ruse . Then marched them back with the lord of the castle as prisoner . And all at the cost of one life , a man who fell in a bog . Might have made it without harm to any if one fellow had watched where his feet were taking him . Damn fools ca n't and wo n't be saved in peace or war . Will choke to death on roast beef or drown in a brass bathing tun . So shovel him under , poor boy , and God rest his foolish soul . . . . How one day at Smerwick . . . Here we had best pause to consider . For the story of that day 's work is well known . If James of Scotland heard it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have nightmares and would be confirmed beyond question to keep Sir Walter Ralegh forever far away and out of sight , dead or alive . Because he has always been thick and close to Spain , I 've no doubt that he 's heard it , maybe many times . It was Italians , soldiers of the Pope of Rome , who landed there , threw up an earth and timber fort , and began to prepare a permanent one . Some say it was Spaniards , and there may have been a few of them there among that motley band . But forp288certain it was not the Spanish Army . How do I know ? Because Spaniards would never have yielded . Proof of that ? Look how the Spaniard , less than four hundred in a similar fort at Crozon , guarding Brest , held long and fast against Sir John Norreys ' whole army in ' 94 . The Spaniards fought and died to the man . Down to Smerwick , perched on the windy southeast cheek of the arse of Ireland , came Lord Grey with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they left behind much undefendedcountry ; and there was already news of an Irish army gathering against them . Why leave the country undefended to march across Ireland and take a little fort ? Because there was every reason to believe this Fort del Oro , as they called it , was designed to be the handhold for landing a large expedition of the Pope 's soldiers or Spain 's or both , who were already thought to be at sea . If they waited to see , they could be caught between the Irish and a foreign expedition like a walnut in a cracker . With the weather miserable and bound to get worse , they arrived at Smerwick , bone-weary and on short rations ; and they mounted an attack on the fort . Which , being well set on high ground and with the sea at its back , proved more than they had bargained for . After Lord Grey had killed off sufficient of his number to prove the fort could not be taken without ordnance , they settled in to wait for an English fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather was only worse . Then up sailed a patrol of English ships to blockade the fort and off-load cannon . Fort del Oro was so nicely placed that the ships could not come close to bring their fire to bear upon it . And even as the cannon began to do their work on the earthworksand timber , the ships pulled in anchors , hoisted canvas , and sailed away on new , urgent orders . Leaving the soldiers ,  |p289even  in victory , with the prospect of a march back at double pace and with next to no rations . The English spared no powder and pounded the fort with cannonballs until a white flag appeared and the Italians parleyed for terms . Now , Lord Grey was not among the best of even our generals , but he was not such a fool as to embark upon a forced march with six hundred prisoners to guard and feed and prod along . He demanded an unconditional surrender and promised them nothing . The poet Spenser , serving as his secretary there , has borne witness to this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other in the parleys , but there were a goodly number of Irish and English renegades in the Pope 's forces . Consider the ways of warfare . Even when all the old rules of chivalry are invoked  --  of which I doubt the knights of old heeded one  --  any man who surrenders to the enemy is gambling skin and bones unless there are the strictest conditions and the means to enforce them . In Ireland the luckiest prisoners on both sides were those hanged or beheaded on the spot . Most likely neither the English nor the Pope 's men were plain or clear with each other . It smacks of double-dealing , but there can be advantages both ways in ambiguity . Lord Grey may have hoped to persuade the last ships to take on prisoners and carry them home to be held for ransom . If so , they were unable or unwilling . The last ships sailed away . The garrison yielded , laid down weapons and took its chances . Maybe hoping the English could not stomach the slaughter of so many . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quickly . He orders two captains , Ralegh and another , to take their companies and to do the work . To hang the Irish and English renegades , breaking their arms and legs first . Top290put the rest , every living soul , to the sword . There were women and children among them . No matter . They killed them swift and sure while the rest of the army packed and prepared to leave . Then the two companies , without taking time to clean the clotted blood , packed bag and baggage , adding weapons and sparse loot , stripping corpses of anythingworth keeping , and marched away . Until they found time and water to wash themselves , his company must have looked more like a gathering of barbersurgeonsthen soldiers . Most interesting is why Lord Grey chose Ralegh for the duty . I can think of reasons . Ralegh had already proved a good soldier . Though not always perfect for obedience , he would do what he was told . And his men would follow him . News of Ralegh 's other adventures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest of men in high places . And Captain Ralegh was now taking time to write letters to these men . Letters concerning the state of things in Ireland . Letters in which he did not hesitate to be critical of Lord Grey . And more sure than if it was sealed in butter , Grey would know about this . For Ralegh , following notions of his half brother , Sir Humphrey Gilbert , and all his Carew kinsmen , favored the rule of Ireland by blood and iron . And then repopulation with Englishmen . I see Lord Grey say to himself : Here 's an impudent man who can lay an ambush and seize a castle , who can kill in battle and is not afraid . He knows something of war and soldiering . Blood and iron ? Well , here 's an inescapable occasion for both . Let us see if he has stomach for it . And Ralegh , knowing his commander , taking the orderp291without raising an eyebrow . Performing it without losing his appetite . Perhaps , too , who knows ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of all that ransom money wasted on blood-soaked earth . Let Captain Ralegh take a share of blame . Ralegh was a good horse soldier and hard as they come . But wars are not won by the cavalry on the wings or in skirmishes or ambush . Wars are won by the plodding infantry square . He commanded his company as he had ridden his horse . And no doubt loved his company in much the same way . If he had ever fought much in close ranks with pike or black bill in the common sweat and slaughter , he would have learned a different sort of lesson . I do not know what he learned at Smerwick . His story and the stories they tell of him show he always remained the sort of leader of men he had been in Ireland . By land or by sea . At Cadiz , sailing the Warspite into the harbor . And is he different at Fayal in the Azores , limping along with his cane , bareheaded and a large white scarf tied to his arm for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a narrow exposedrocky trail under a beehive of Spanish bullets , his cape as full of holes as a piece of Geneva cheese , to storm and take the Spanish fort there ? I think it is the same man . No doubt he knew what he was doing and the reasons why . Believed circumstances called for the gamble . For though he might and did often take risks , he was never a rash  --  and vaingloriousin my humble opinion  --  man like Essex . I think if he had not been on his back , wrestling fever for his life , he would have taken the Spaniards at San Thorne and maybe have found his gold mine there.  |p292Still  , I believe he learned a lesson in Ireland . And maybe at Smerwick . Learned that it was already too late to unlearn old habits . Too late for him to change the cavalry style . Learning that war stark naked is more than the canter of cavalry . For after that time in Ireland , he never favored the use of large English armies on land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing must be made ; and he only soldiered in defense of the realm . Ride hard , hit fast , and run was his style , the only style he knew . Well , he could have it that way on a ship , I 'd reckon . But not for him to lead armies . He let Essex do that and fail and fail again . He watched Mountjoy do it and succeed . No , he did not lose his appetite for fighting at Smerwick . But I 'll wager he lost his stomach for the tedious butcher 's work of blood and iron . And he saw Lord Grey carry that idea of blood and iron to the extremity in Munster . Lay waste to all , denuding the land and leaving a wealth of bones , some living on as walking bags of bones , it is true , behind . Where the only thing , man or plant or beast , left thriving and fat was the wide-winged , slow-soaring , insatiable kite in the sky . After Ireland , he was chiefly in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen . She took a threadbare knave of a soldier and made him one of the richest men in the kingdom . Showered gold and honors on his head . Let me not pretend to understand all the why 's and the wherefore 's . But , casting aside envy , I have some opinions . I note that in a very short time the Queen made him from nothing to a great man , almost overburdened with the weight of riches . I note , too , that even when he was in disgrace becausep293of a secret marriage out of necessity to one of her maids of honor in ' 91 , even then she did not deprive him of what she had given  --  estates , perquisites , offices . For the whole time that he was forbidden the Court , he retainedand she left vacant  --  a very strange thing it seems to me  --  his post as Captain of the Guard . And I note , too , sir , that although in her reign he held many offices , his chief and only office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guard . Never , in spite of intriguing , was he elevated to the Council . All this whets my interest . A little puzzle game . Childish it may seem to those who know the ways of Courts , but for me it is a knot to untangle . I say these things to myself : She who was Captain of England chose one of the best of her military captains to be her own . She , who the world knows was frugal as a poor farmer 's wife , nevertheless was fantastical in her rewards to this man . More than to any , directly , if you consider it . For she may or may not have given more to other favorites , but he was given most , becausechanged most . From nothing to great wealth is more and means more than any addition to the man who possesses an estate . She , who was fierce in retribution to all who betrayed her confidence and trust , let him off with a punishment so light it was , in the ways of the Court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Bess Throckmorton who suffered most . Now , sir , much has been said of the Queen 's fondness for her favorites and her womanly jealousy and suchlike . I 'll not deny that , since I do n't know enough to affirm or deny . What I do know is what can be easily known and proved.  |p294That  , allowing for misjudgments , the late Queen had a marveloushabit of choosing the right man for the proper office . I can not imagine Court or Council which contained so many good servants . True , they were often opposed to one another and their advice and counsel was contradictory . Just so . I understand this . When I was a captain I listened to my lieutenant , my green ensign , my sergeants and corporals . Indeed , I would listen to a pikeman if he had something to tell me . Listened and weighed all , then made my own free choice and issued my orders . In the nature of things , each speaking out of his own view , from his own vantage , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me if they had ever agreed in perfect harmony . The Queen could , likewise , listen to Ralegh and listen to Essex . Hear Burghley and Leicester , Throckmorton , Sir Nicholas Bacon , Walsingham , Gresham . Oh , name a hundred more . Could , as one of her mottoes says , see everything and say nothing . Very well , I have wandered afield . My question is : Considering all I know and can judge by , beginning and end , what caught her eye and kept her favor toward Walter Ralegh ? Why this one instead of a dozen or more of the others hanging by , men who were living on promises , patiently waiting upon and serving her until their patience finally vanished with their wits and the substance of their estates ? Say this : She marked him for what he was , a man with nothing to lose  --  a soldier . A man who had gambled his life for no reward many times . Just as she had . Just as she must . A man who acted like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since childhood and more danger as Queen of a threatened kingdom , needed such a man close by . Then , my guess is , she tested him , with lavish rewards . Thep295best of men can be corrupted by an excess of good fortune . The hardest resolve can be softened by too much sweetness . Outwardly he changed not at all . Or better , since his swagger and appearance outraged so many , say that though he changed his vestments , he gave every sign of being the same beneath them . Misfortune settled the matter . When still a soldier , though in the privy chamber and beyond , he found one of the Queen 's maids of honor swelling up with his seed , he married her in secret . And the two tried to brazen it out . They failed , of course . Here , someone will say , he failed the Queen 's testing . Another will add that Ralegh proved his limits , how far and how well he could be trusted . I would argue that to find the limits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good dog , have limits to these  --  had been her aim all along . She may have been secretly happy upon two counts . First that his actions served to confirm her original judgment of him . And all those who lead men need some confirmation of their judgments . Second , relieved she had not been so enchanted as to raise him higher , where he could work real harm . He proved himself not quite fit for the Council . Not by greed , for she made good use of greedy men . Not by lechery either or , for that matter , folly or infidelity . Those failings can be taken into account . Not by any of these so much as by  --  indifference . In a final corner of himself , he did not care . The Queen could go and stand on her head . I think , sir , the Queen may have been pleased . Now she knew her man by heart . Do you see ?  |p296In  certain conditions , in the grip of uncertain events , Ralegh would throw away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his finest moments would come at those times when a future seems no longer possible . His most shining times would be those , like a soldier 's , of pure and perfect present time . She could hope such a time would never come for her or the kingdom . Yet if it should happen that all things fell away , in adversity and dreadful misfortune , and all things and all hopes were lost , he would still be there and then he would surely live or die for her . His life and body would shield hers . And not out of love or fidelity or ambition or honor or virtue , but out of the joy and the style of it and because that time would truly be his home . Thus none of her favors had been wasted . She could wish him well and look on him always with love and confidence . Well , so do I wish him well . Though if I wake him from his snooze to tell him so , he 'll curse me for a meddlesome fool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll bet you . There he dozes . Who else but an old soldier could nap in the shadow of the heading ax ? Why not ? He has lived a long time and far beyond the use of king and kingdom . His time was really done when the King made peace . For a soldier in peace is a chimney in summertime . One thing more and then I am done . Somewhere in the fields of France a stranger wheeled horse and fired at the lad from a dozen paces and the wind and heat of the bullet singed his ear . Then the lad fired his pistol and saw a man gasp , go white-eyed , and topple out of saddle to lie spurtingblood on grass while the riderless horse galloped away . Somewhere , then and there , Walter Ralegh gave up his ghost with ap297shudder . And as a good hunter honors the fallen stag , so he , looking down at a dying stranger , partook of death himself . A man can only die once . A soldier dies early , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him , nothing he ever earned . Every soldier is the ghost of the man he was . He can never shed fear until he sheds flesh and bones . But he need not be fearful . What does a ghost have to be afraid of ? Take it all , wars and glory and riches and fame , and stuff it down the privy . I 'll settle for one more night in a certain Irish tower by the burning fire.  |p298Say  to the Court it glowes and shines like rotten wood .. .

To enter that house and wait for his turn with someone who , if no lady , offering no idyllic garden , could share , bright as a summer hayfield , in the immemorial country of flesh and forgetfulness . Yet knowing , even at peak pleasure , he would sleep late in the morning , eggshell head full of noises , drums and horsemen , dreams of another kind of rod across his backside at school long ago . Fears , too , of the first jewel , prime bloom of God-knowswhatnameless French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters , foul purges and medicines , chilling baths . Might tell of the solemn frenzies in summer when the Queen made her progress in the country . Miles of wagons and horses ; jolt and jar of roads . Saddlesore , sunburned , wind-wrinkled , sweat-bathed , and well powdered  --  with English dust . To arrive at last at some manor house , grand as a palace and newer than any , owned by a fellow no better than himself , only luckier . " Well , we 'll see about that , my great man , while we drink you dry , cellar and wells , gobble your fodder in stable , pick your meat to slick bones at table . Break glasses and filch a silver salt . . . " Placed in a chamber small as a monk 's cell , if not in a tent , a bed like a coffin to share with three others . But to turn out prompt and clean as a whistle , fresh as a May morn , to stand and hear interminable hexameter Latin verses and speeches delivered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusty old knights , full of fire and beer and braggadocio ,  |p303greeting  the Queen . Music tortured by awkward musicians . With good luck , maybe a country dance of lightly clad , beflowered , sturdy-limbed country girls . " Always a chance , my lad , in the darkness , while fireworks and colored fountains play for the Queen 's pleasure , to slip away with some fine country lass and teach her the oldest of Court dances , to clothe her in green clover and show her a wondrous rocket of my own . " Up before daylight to hunt ; not himself to kill , but to haloo and cry with valiant vigor though it lift the roof of his head , and to bear , with saintly grin , hunting horns screaming inside it . Seeing not much with red-rimmed , red-veined , and lid-lazy eyes . Holding tight rein and gripping saddle with trembling shanks lest he tumble and break a leg and have to lay a month in the country to mend . No better off than the parable 's man in the ditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up at dawn in a roar of packing and leaving . " And who stole my toothcream and toothpicks ? By God , I 'll have his liver in an Apostle spoon ! " More speeches to hear , farewells ; and pray that the girl , over there , does n't know your face by daylight ; it 's for sure you never told her your name . And then off again , one of a string of fantastic beads , down a road of pure dust or pure mud , mouth full of wool and beard made of cobwebs , happy to doze and happier to sweat away ale and soreness of the nights before . " Call it a poem and a pilgrimage . I call it a pain in the arse . " He could tell all that and more . With uncertain nostalgiaand shrugging . Conceal any shame behind a taut grin of regret . For he was not raised up to or taught to love idleness . Andthat 's what it was , what all added up to in the reckoning . A longp304accounting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take , but sadly regretted now that none of his schemes took roots . Better he had stayed home to become , maybe , a justice of the peace . Or taken a company to the wars to risk his neck and his health for small pay and dead men 's wages and whatever he could scoop and scrounge ; or gone to sea and risked fevers and drowning and the Spanish Inquisition in the hope of gold and other dry goods . Better that than this ; but he chose it once because  --  they told him at home and he believed them  --  he had good looks , quick wit , a nimble way about him , and an eye for advancement . Now looks have gone , wits are weary , having never had much exercise ; limbs are not nimble , and his eye rests on a fat country widow who smiles to prove the scarcity of good teeth in England . But she has a nice piece of land and a sturdy halftimberedthatch-roof house , and cattle and pigs , and not too many children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For he 'll still dress up in the patched ruins of his Court clothes  --  lucky to have kept clothes on his back  --  and strut like a peacock ; as at Court he never could . Ah , he saw the real peacocks , close enough to copy . Though he skulked and shrunk whenever they came by . Though slack of wit and weary of recollection , he can tell lies as well as a London tapster . And if his tales please her , and though her tail prove as tough as a Dutch saddle , he can live out his remainingdays in modest comfort , and  --  who knows ?  --  die a country knight who lived a fool . But leave him , for this moment . Leave him to the English countryside . For it is not he who has come to stand with an ambiguous smile and a loose-limbed satiric posture . Not he set free fromp305the frame of a portrait or an oval miniature by Isaac Oliver or Nicholas Hilliard , fitted to one perfect gold locket ; to hang upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  unless that fashion should change this season  --  between two perfect , gentle , milk-white , classic , rounded temples , pavilions of love , much worshiped in an excess of adoring kisses . Not a finished picture . Not to be found in any gallery , or high attic festooned with cobwebs , or turned to the wall in a cellar . He has never posed for his own portrait ; though he has sat in a stiff pose for another , a great man , after the features and lines of the true model were drawn from the quick . Such men are busy with affairs and can not keep still for picture makers . For a jest he wore his own new slippers wrought in frilly , fancy Paris style . But the gentleman he posed for can not have troubled to notice this , and now sits in the portrait gallery of a manor house in all his splendor , wearing an incongruous pair of peach-colored , utterly foppish French slippers . He will sit no more for others ' pictures . Unless , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask him . And that will not happen . He will not , either , have his own portrait done . No way to know if this ageless young man has come from manor house or ancient castle . Perhaps he is a younger son , cousin , or a nephew of modest means . A matter of no consequence . Nor whether he idled at Cambridge or Oxford or which , if any , of the Inns of Court he calls his . He has read proper books and knows improper ones as well . And , rich or poor , son of an ambitious merchant or some stark-Bedlam knight of the pasture , he plays his part with such an ease that anyone mustp306wish for him that his bloodline could be traced back to Britomartis . To wish is but a half step from believing it so . Handsome , healthy , and well favored , much barbered , groomed , and beautifully dressed  --  even to the last gentle grace note to complete the harmony , a certain slight negligence , some signs of artful casualness , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for poems and easy rhymes . The other one kicking stones and clods in the meadow behind the cottage he first came from and has returned to , poorer than he planned , still daydreaming , a litigious daydream , the case for and against the widow ; widow of the gap-toothed , irrepressiblesmile . Trying to discount a cynical , skeptical barrister'svoice that tells him he knows , without further examination , what secrets lie hidden beneath apron , kirtle , gown , skirt , and shift . Denying that voice and trying to conjure up an inverse ciphering whereby her charms , at last exposed and tasted , will be sweeter and softer and uncloying exactly in opposite balance to her formidable front : ragged-sail , leaky ; just as an old galleon may conceal chests of treasure , sacks of rare spices , bolts of silk ; just so imagining her and hoping imagining will make it so and raise his ensign proudly and no retreat ; fantasy being more than half the music , half the art . This one changed , grew older , bade farewell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dark of the moon on account of a misunderstanding with a certain greedy moneylenderwho had not given him half value on his best plate . Vowing never to return . Took passage homeward not by horse or coach , but propped in a rumbling baggage cart . Until , one day 's journey from his village , he rented the best post horse at the inn . Changed into his finest , buckled harness and sword andp307set forth . Into a pouring rain , leading and tugging the horse through mud on a road that seemed to have vanished , and , indeed , did so before , far after nightfall , he sneaked up the village street and beyond it to a house where he waited , rain or no rain , a long time to knock and wake the servants , feeling , without having to see , his wet ruff and cuffs limp and sad , his hat shapeless as an oyster ; muddy as a pig farmer ; all soaked to the bone -- one last lost survivor of the Armada . Ready finally to rap on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tallow candle , yellow in its horn lantern , unblinkingin spite of the gasps which greeted him . " I should have been here in time for supper . But I was set upon by a half-dozen idle rogues armed with cudgels . " " Lord God , are you hurt ? " " A few bruises . No matter , no matter . One of these gypsies had a pistol and he pointed it straight at my heart ... . " But rain had ruined the fellow 's powder . He could n't make flash or fire . So I skewered him clean with my sword . Danced him like a chunk of mutton on a spit and left him to feed kites . " If a man points pistol at me and aims to kill , he must pay the price . " " And the others ? " " Well , now , when they saw this gypsy go to God , they dropped sticks and took off like a flock of bleating sheep . Haloo ! says I. I may be late for supper but damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran them for miles , clean out of the county . And I doubt they 've caught their wind yet . . . . " Laughs and laughs until the old servant chuckles too . A pause . " Well ? " " Are you finished , sir ? "  | " What do you mean by that ? " " Only , sir , if it pleases you , I was thinking if you had done with your tale , you might like to come in out of the rain . " No , not that man . Who changed with the times without ever changing . Ask him , and he 'll define mutability without hesitation . " Why , ' t is the wiggling of fingers and wagging of handswhereby the deaf and dumb make chatter with each other . " Take instead the other , the ageless young man . Take him as young and unlined , save when he raises an eyebrow , or the laughing edges of his eyes , the corners of his lips ; forever unchanging and unfading . He is the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , all that the changing world and Court could ever know , burning with change , his nature like the nature of flame , restless , ever swaying and dancing , dying down to flare up again with least encouragement of air . If he is one man , he is also many . As all the cards together make a deck ... . And in that bunch every card 's a one-eyed knave ! Voice of our disgruntled , discarded country gentleman , still outraged . Listen ! he calls out . I know the fellow well , or else his twin brother . I sat at table playing cards with him . Played at Spanish primero and honest English trump . Played gleek and maw , post and pair , and Pope July , and never won so much as a clipped coin oft him . Those young peacocks had rings upon their fingers with mirrors set amongst the jewels.  --  Console yourself , sir , the young man replies . Think : Far from Court , far from care . Think , in restored country wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a cloister who wishes to go from thence to heaven . Damn you , sir ! ( the other voice , fading , answering from safety of distance ) , An ape is still an ape though he be clad in purple.  --  To which , sir , in the same spirit , permit me to reply : You can not make a whistle out of a pig 's tail . Be content , and rememberbefore you spurn that well-fed village widow : There is a virtue which poverty can not destroy . Go to and be content . You are out of the rain . You are eating bread and cheese and drinking the widow 's cider from a stout wooden cup . And if the woman will believe half your tales , why you may yet be named the best liar in England . There is no further answer from the other . The young man turns to best advantage , to the light , to speak for himself.  --  A poor country bumpkin , with little money and less charm . Though , perhaps , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some godforsaken village in a distant county where none of us knows anyone or wishes to . Some fellow whose grandfather was knighted by a dead king in a moment of drunkenness or fever . And on that alone , came bouncing into Court to make his fortune , to play the bright angel who tripped over the ledge of heaven and fell , ass over joint stool , down to common earth.  --  Pity is wasted on the man . He is a sheep , fit for an age of sheep . And sheep are single-minded animals , solemn and stupid beyond believing . The last frisk of life goes out of them when they cease to he called lambs . Their happiest destiny is to be a joint of cold mutton in an alehouse.  --  Believe mc , I have no compassion for those fellows . Thep310worst are insufferable impudent rogues . The best are bodies to fill a chamber or swell a progress . And each and every one is a clown . Of course , the more the merrier . We plucked them , feathers and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Without them one might have been sore pressed , at times , for money and amusement.  --  I recall one solemn fellow , fat as a pig and not half so fastidious , who besought us , with most touching simplicity , to teach him the ways and manners of the Court and how to advancehimself.  --  We laughed and were about to begin his education with the art of throwing dice , when Harrington , Sir John , the Queen 's godson and a most amusing fellow , really , Harrington stopped us before we had begun . " No , no ! " quoth Harrington . " You idle , ignorant , lascivious , negligent , parasitical popinjays have forgotten the first principle of the Gospel according to Castiglione . " " A sinister and wicked Italian , as I recall , " someone said . " A devious writer bent upon corrupting youth . " " And , devoting yourselves to wholly frivolous pastimes when you could be reading The Book of Martyrs or hearing a sermon in the city . " " But , Harrington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of martyr , do n't you see ? I 've taken on poverty , chastity , and obedience , all in the service of the Queen . And now I offer my life and example , a martyr to eternal tedium . " " Be still , " Harrington says . " You were born to die at the end of a rope . It 's written in the stars . " " I never look at the stars . They are too perfect . Perfection is tedious too . " " You are so debauched , so vicious with deadly sloth and thep311other six , whatever they may be , you have forgotten all you learned in school , if you learned anything but to count the strokes of the master 's cane on your backside . Have you forgottenOvid ? This world is nothing but continual change and transformation . And I propose to prove the poet was right . I intend to turn this into a silk purse . " " Oh , thank you , sir , " says the fat boy . " And I promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill that silk purse . "  --  Followed by our laughter , a pack of hounds at their heels , Harrington and the fellow left our chamber arm in arm.  --  Rumor was bruited about that Harrington was dead earnest in his pedagogy . And , sure enough , he might have been a Jesuit for all we saw of him for a month or so . We heard he was teaching the fellow , in brief , of course , according to Castiglione . He was seen hopping about like a trained seal , while Sir John shouted hoarse encouragement , at an Italian fencing school . Someone passed beneath a window and heard a lute , terribly tuned , tortured , and a voice singing what might have been " Greensleeves , " if sung by a drunken Muscovite.  --  It was widely believed in our circle that Harrington would try to pass the fellow off as a foreigner . Or perhaps with a cloak of feathers and stain of walnut juice he could play an Indian . In rags he would be a perfect Irishman.  --  Not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of his own tailor . Then brought him forth , a very elegant satirical model of the finest men of the Court . Perfect to the last details tailor and barber could contrive.  --  Being the Queen 's godson and amusing to Her Majesty at all but most serious moments , Sir John had no difficulty arrangingoccasion to present his pupil to the Queen . It was , as Ip312recall , in the large presence chamber at Whitehall . There were many of the Court there , for the news had traveled the corridors on greased wheels.  --  The two were summoned and brought forward to kneel before Her Majesty . They must have rehearsed it a thousand times . For the pupil dropped to his knees before the Queen as graceful as if he had been doing so for all his years.  --  Unfortunately , as he did so , he farted.  --  It was not , I should venture , a decorous fart . Some say it was a trumpet fart . Others , because of the rich resonance , insistthat it was more like the deep blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a large cannon fired in a small room.  --  At that moment all the candles flickered and burned blue . Portraits went aslant on the walls . A pensioner or two may have fainted . I swear I heard a halberd fall and clatter on the floor before the echo had died away . There was so great a quiet you could have heard whispers behind a lady 's fan at a hundred yards . " Which one of you did that ? " Her Majesty demanded . " I confess it was I , " Harrington , ever unruffled , replied . " I 've been somewhat windy all day . "  --  The Queen said nothing for a moment , staring at the two of them.  --  And very slowly , as if fire had been kindled behind his eyes , the round face of the pupil began to glow , first maidenblushingpink as dawn , then brighter and deeper , until , having run through a full day in less time than it requires to snap your fingers , his face was a truly magnificent sunset painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell more lies than thep313Pope 's epitaph ! " the Queen said . " It was that fat boy who let fly the fart . Begone , both of you . My eyes are burning and I think I may go blind . " The young man smiles again , tilts his head and seems to lean back against nothing , as he might be resting against a wall or a column . A trick , no doubt , he learned at Court . Come closer and see him change , transformed without moving muscle or adding a cubit to his stature . Except , of course , as fashion in heels and in thickness of soles causes him to rise and fall . First , he 's beardless as a boy , short-haired , flat soft slanting cap with a burst of downy feathers over one ear . Long , highcollareddoublet , short hose , and over all a long gown with hanging sleeves , fur-trimmed ; heavy shoes with square , blunted toes . Next he wears a beard , long and full , merging with a thick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a jewel or two , thin rim of white at the collar ; and where he once wore an ornamental dagger , he wears one sharp enough to carve meat ; and wears also a large-handled , heavy , one-handed sword . Look again . . . . Well before the Armada sailed you find him  --  a little awkward now  --  in padded and stiffened short doubletwith many buttons and peascod belly ( like a pregnant wench ) . Puffed sleeves with wings , short hose and bright garters ; flat lacework collar overtopped by the high rising of a white shirt collar . Long hair , cut even below the ears , and beard and mustache short and pointed and tamed.  --  Truly , he interrupts , that was a bad time , brief as it was , for any man with decent conformation . It was a plot , a con/spiracy of certain wicked old men , rough seagoing types and suchlike who were then close to Her Majesty . Or perhaps it was Her Majesty 's stratagem to make these salty dogs at home in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the rest of us , her perennial honeybees , ashamed of being such idle fops . The Queen was very moral at times about such things . She offered us occasional opportunities to feel some shame for our shallow lives and idle pastimes . But I am happy to report that none of my acquaintance ever took advantage of the occasion . Nor , I suppose , did she expect us to.  --  May I say with all modesty that upon one occasion I was kneeling nearby in attendance , and I overheard Her Majesty jesting with the Earl of Leicester . Who , as her favorite then , set the fashions . " If we women were half as vain and inconstant in our clothing , " she said , " we would ruin our lovers and husbands and plunge the kingdom into poverty . "  --  Leicester grumbled and pretended to take offense . He assured the Queen that he took no more thought about matters of appearance than a scarecrow in a field ; for she of all people should know that his heart and mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked into his earnest face where he knelt next to her , the portrait of an aged choirboy . And then she laughed out loud . " Go to , go to ! " she cried out . So heads turned from a distance and the corners of the chamber quieted to hear . " You foolish man , I 'll wager a jewel if you come here for dinner tomorrow , barefoot and naked as Adam , with only an empty fish cask to hide your shame , why , before supper every man in Court , except my Guard , will be clad in wooden staves and smelling of flounder . "  | " If I did that , " the Earl said , " I would want time to discuss the matter with my friends in the fish market . " " You would , indeed , " she said , pinching the jowl of his cheek . " A proper cask would be worth its weight in silver before you put it on . " " Well , " says he , " a well-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'd extoll the virtues of wicker baskets and then buy casks for half what they 're worth . " " I fear you do n't know the shrewd practices and sharp wit of London fishmongers , " he says . " An empty cask in and of itself is one thing . A pure fish barrel , as it were . There are very few of those , Your Majesty . " " Do you speak from experience or rumor , Robin ? " " From speculation , ma'am . You know I am a Puritan at heart . " " Go on , then . Tell us your fantasy . " " I say that an empty fish cask , pristine and unsullied , is rare as the unicorn in this kingdom . " " Then you shall have to buy full casks . What will you do with the fish ? " " When the watch is sound asleep , I 'll steal through the streets of London and leave heaps and mounds of fish at every corner . And for years after it will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day of the Earl of Leicester 's Miracle . He produced no loaves at all , but there were fishes in God 's plenty . " " Why , man , the whole of London will stink of dead fish . " " It will not be noticed , ma'am . " " It is a miracle that I do not box your ears in the presence of this company . "  | " Why then , I could not wear a fish barrel . Nothing but sackcloth and ashes would serve me . " " Ah , Robin , not even you could bring sackcloth and ashes into fashion in my Court . But I still wager a jewel you wo n't appear tomorrow in a fishmonger 's cask . You are too vain . " " Your Majesty knows me well , chapter and verse . You shall have your jewel . But I am not so certain that vanity is the spring of my fears . " " What then ? " " Allow me a little Christian compassion , " he says . " Some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wand . . . ( Pointing directly at me where I knelt and she nodding and smiling . ) " And might shiver to death in Adam 's costume . " " I suppose , " she said , still glancing at me , " it would be a trick to kneel in a cask . " " Perhaps he could manage a fig leaf gracefully . " " Go to , you naughty man ! "  --  Where were we ? Ah , yes , we were digressing upon the theme of the padded doublet , if anyone could possibly care . Of course , God 's truth , there were times when I cared about nothing else but fashion . And , considering all , those times were , if I may say so , among my most memorable . It is possible to believe him.  --  Pray do not fall into that common error . Nothing good can come from too much trust between strangers  --  friends either . Excess leads to ruination . The rule of moderation holds true for everything save laughter . There can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should surely enjoy a second Deluge , for this world would be drowned in tears . . . .  |p317The  faint smile never flickers , but the eyes are tired and sad . In a moment he might weep , if ghosts can shed tears . Perhaps , like a player , he can summon tears for any performance.  --  Let us return to the high thin air of Courts , thinner and colder than winds of the Alps . No doubt he has visited Italy.  --  Every Englishman of any quality has made a tour there . Has traveled in spirit if flesh were willing , but purse too thin.  --  Now then , let us be done with the peascod doublet once and for all.  --  I do here solemnly confess that I , too , wore it when that was the fashion , ridiculous as a puppet , Punch or Judy , no matter which . But there were other choices . When I could , despite its overt military air , I wore a pinked sleeveless jerkin , pinched in tight at the waist , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier , and only a thin line of puffed lace along the edge . It suited me well , except for a flare at the hips and the loose short breeches . Which implied that I was proud possessor of a beam as broad as a Devonshire milkmaid . Now see him in the glorious eighties , wearing a short doublet , knee breeches , long trunk hose , short , elegantly embroidered doublet fitting naturally ; a cloak worn loose with a swagger , held by hidden laces ; the collar gone , replaced by starched white folds of ruff , slanting from beneath the ears down to the point of the beard ; rings on his fingers , and jewels join the feathers of his cap . For his feet he wears soft felt or velvet , backless mules ; high boots for outdoors.  --  Let the record show that I courageously ignored the prevailingfashion of the high-crowned sugarloaf hat . I owned one like everyone else ; and , I admit I wore it once . But my friends told me that I most resembled a chimney looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in matching doublet and Venetians , soft slippers with backs , and an astounding cartwheel ruff of lace , held out half a yard by wire or bone , and making his head , the hair a little longer and brushed back behind the ears , seem set upon a white platter . Before the century has turned , he is in better form in tightfittingdoublet , short , the shoulders widened and padded with wings ; much intricate small decoration and embroidery against sober colors ; the ruff diminished to more modest proportion , but now aided and abetted by a lace collar , or a falling band , beneath it ; of the same material , delicate to transparency , an inch or so of lace cuff turned back at the ends of the sleeves . In the Court of King James the ruff will grow marvelous again , then mysteriously vanish forever , replaced by a wide starched collar ; short doublet coming to a point ; a length of stocking for the showing off of a fine leg  --  thin ones could be deftly padded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness ; pointed shoes with high cork heels , roses and ribbons or jewels on the shoe ; and , like it or not , a tall crowned hat , wide or narrow of brim , with a colorful band and one or more feathers drooping low . Hair longer , sometimes to shoulder length ; beard no more than a well-trained point of the chin ; mustache , however , full and wide and waxed.  --  May I add something to this protean picture ? Please remember that any part of any one fashion might be worn with an alloy of others , according to taste and preference . Allow , too , that a man could settle his choice upon one style that pleased him most and wear it without regard to fashion.  --  Travel has been mentioned , both in uncomfortable fact and contented imagination . Some brought the bits and pieces of foreign fashions home with them . Others  --  some who hadp319never stepped beyond the counties of their birth  --  would borrowa whim or notion , transformed by English tailors.  --  Consider that all the turns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners to live in England . They came from the Netherlands , from Germany , France , and Portugal , bringing their styles and their crafts of making and dyeing ; new ways of weaving and coloring and cutting ; starch and colored starch.  --  There was the jest in a common play , an English play , how an Englishman acquired his doublet in Italy , hose in France , bonnet in Germany , and his behavior everywhere . Taking such for granted , he does not mention the uniforms , gowns , and badges of office , of clerks and scholars , officers of government , offices of the Court , the clergy with ordered ranks and vestments , orders of knighthood and nobility . And the habitual clothing of the crafts and guilds , prentice , journeyman , and master . And servants clad according to the master 's wishes , the whole intricate ladder of ranks and stations , from turnspit and scullion to secretary and steward.  --  Compound it more by considering regulations and sumptuarylaws , statutes designed to preserve some kind of order amid this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Needless to say , these laws changed with the music of fashion and were largely unenforced , being unenforceable . A freeborn Englishman has always deemed it a part of his natural liberty to dress as he pleases.  --  At Court , however , whims of the Queen were law . Woe to the lady who appeared there in anything more resplendent than the Queen ! Ilc is not interested in religious distinctions : the Puritan who railed against sumptuous apparel and affected , as his badge ofp320honor , sober dress of plainest stuffs . The Jesuit , risking his life to bring his ministry to the faithful , therefore carefully disguised . And this is less than one half of the chronicle of costume . For the women , as ever , and especially in England , where their freedom forever astonished foreigners , were more elaborate and various in their fashions.  --  You have not troubled to mention the materials from which our costumes were wrought . From our native cloth makers came wool and other yarns : fustian , kerseys , broadcloths , and cottons . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bays and says , and mockado . And a wealth of the finer things : silk , damask , brocade , taffeta , sarcenet , satin , velvet , fine lawn , and cambric.  --  And the colors ! All colors of nature and shades of the rainbow , together with a hundred subtle distinctions of each , each with a proper name : Popinjay Green , Peachflower , Maiden 's Blush , Russet Red , Horseflesh , Peas Porridge Tawny , Flame , Gingerline , Ash , Maidenhair Brown , Drake 's Color , Dead Spaniard , Devil-in-the-Hedge , Marigold , Kendal Green , Isabel , Bloodred , Gooseturd Green , etc.  --  Picture every kind of fur , from beaver and otter to ermine . Every kind of leather , kidskin , suede . Handkerchiefs of rarest silk . Lacework adorning , and that lace made as fine as ferns . And all but the plainest garments embroidered inch by inch with rich threads , sometimes gold and silver . Tiny perfect jewels and gems sewn into cloth . The linings of all things made equally fine and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Not extraordinary to see a close row of buttons , ten , fourteen , or twenty-four , with each button a piece of gold , a small cut diamond in the center.  |  --  Hats of every kind and shape made of velvet or silk or beaver or ermine , adorned with ribbons and jewels , and with such bursts of the feathers of rare birds that we were called " the most feather-headed folk in the world . "  --  With gloves and shoes and girdles delicately scented.  --  Men and women wearing golden chains for their purses and watches and mirrors and penknives . The women carrying their masks and fans , all jeweled ; busks , muffs , periwigs and bodkins . And whether wearing wigs or their own hair , dusting it with bits of jewels , flecks of the dust of gold.  --  All wearing jewels . Earrings of pearl and precious stones . Jewels upon scabbard and hilt of sword and dagger . The women with long rows of heavy bracelets over their sleeves . Necklaces with cameos of ivory or whale tooth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the pulse of time upon the wrist.  --  And at a cost beyond calculation . An embroidered waistcoatcould cost as much as a small merchant ship . Short Spanish cloaks were worth several waistcoats.  --  If Walter Ralegh indeed spread a cloak for the Queen at a splashy place , the Queen then walked across a good year 's living for an ordinary gentleman.  --  In the reign of the Queen a pair of silk stockings cost more than an entire costume of her grandfather 's time.  --  Strangers , even from the rich countries , were baffled by our light extraordinary costumes . Which were worn with a blithe disregard for their fragility , and a perfect indifference to weather.  --  Costumes , worn as if all were actors in a play . And indeed these were true revelers , playing parts in the masques and joiningthe ( lancing afterwards with the Queen.  --  Fantasies out of a dream of chivalry , created for the sur/prising entrance of some man and his attendants before the Queen . Pleasing her or displeasing her  --  upon one occasion , one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a scene as that one on AccessionDay , 1598 , when a tournament was prepared in honor of the Queen . For her pleasure , Sir Walter Ralegh gave the yeomen of the Guard plumes of orange tawny to wear . Whereupon , the Earl of Essex suddenly appeared , fresh from Wansted , where he had been in a fit of pouting and sulking , with more than two thousand men , knights and retainers , ten times the number of her Guard all wearing the same plumes . The populacewas delighted by the Earl 's crude wit.  --  The Queen was not diverted by the sight of the Earl arrivingwith an army , like a baron of long ago , and , even in jest against a rival , willing to insult her honor , and , more dangerous , playing to the people , a show of wit and force and indifference , for their favor , their delight.  --  The Queen waited and watched and said nothing . Until Essex , all eyes on him , performed poorly at the tilt . At which moment she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself the sight of Essex 's disgrace.  --  There you have it , but not the full beauty . For , you see , the Queen knew Essex was no champion of the tiltyard . Knew there were a dozen men who could make a clown of him . Thereforeshe sat in her place and let that occur . Then , out of a gesture of seeming pity , called off the tournament and departed . Leaving those who had applauded him to laugh . The final rosette of irony being that she did , in truth , pity him and sought to school him in the craft of survival . Well then , disguise laid upon disguise . Life like a butterfly , a bee 's brief springtime of gathering honey . All things changingp323shape and form . All things afire with change . And yet , beneath all changes and disguises , was the forked , pale , hairy pelt of flesh shared by all alive . And , in fact , all that flowering clothing , fruit and blossom , was grafted upon one trunk . The multitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more essentialtruth : that the one model of clothing never truly changed . Doublet , hose , jerkin , these were the three elements of costume of all Englishmen for a century and more . Farmer and blacksmith , beggar and barrister , mariner and merchant , child and man , all wore essentially the same clothing . No matter what differences in quality or kind of cloth . A way of dressing in functional purity , well fitting , made for action , for graceful and quick movement and for hard labor too , for riding , climbing , running , fighting , working . . . .  --  And for dancing and merely idling about . Though half the English nation might seek to imitate the Court , while the other half was railing against us , the Court was always the same and true to its original form ; unchanging though it seemed to be the theater of change.  --  Clothing tells the story in small compass . Our clothing only seemed to change , the true design being maintained within disguises of decoration , embroidery , accessories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aped from foreign nations . Which amused strangers well enough , but served some purpose . One being show , the spectacle of power . Conquest , as it were . We seemed able to take whatever we chose from foreign nations for ourselves . To loot and pillage without war . What we took up could seem like a tribute offered . Adding up to create an imaginaryempire served by all nations , friendly and hostile , with England at the center . Which is a fable as unlikely as Aesop'sp324moralities of talking , reasoning lions and ravens and foxes and geese . But a fable can inspire a dream that it is true.  --  Consider also that , as in all double-edged things , the discontentof Puritan , Jesuit , or proud old-fashioned Englishman against fashions of Court served a beneficial purpose . All railed against our apparel , each for his own reasons . It was a diverting subject , an object for satire and contempt . They were not only diverted , but beguiled . For they would have made complaint in any case . Better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And their complaining served somewhat to check extraordinaryexcesses by the Court.  --  And do not forget that the celebration of the old , which had not been so celebrated when it was new , became a part of the same fable , implying a unity , an honor of the chronicle of England.  --  Not least , all could unite in complaint against the Queen 's gaudy Court and most against those supreme peacocks  --  her favorites.  --  Better satiric arrows , of those who swore all our virtue was gone with the longbow , should be aimed at them than at the Queen.  --  For all its beauty , our clothing lasted not much longer than the fashion of it . Materials made for the present , not to last . Gone like the autumn leaves . Just so ... . Gone with the totteringbanquet houses where once we danced . Gone with the jewels she had pawned by the end ; so that the new King found much cunning paste and glass . Gone , at the last , with the Queen herself , her policy , her great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralegh served two Courts , the one long , the other briefly . In the former he was called a fortunate upstart knave.  |p325In  the latter , though never a presence , he has been , like the ghost of himself , a long and vexing memory.  --  The letter of all courts is much the same , but the spirit comes from the prince , first set , then maintained according to the purposes , character , and power of the ruler.  --  You must imagine the Court of the Queen before you picturehim there.  --  When she came to London for her coronation , at one of the magnificent arches where spectacles were presented in her honor , she took especial note of a player who was tricked out as an ancient man armed with a scythe and an hourglass , representingFather Time . " Time . . . " she said . " Time hath brought me here . "  --  Which was all she could gloss from the text of the past . Last and least likely to wear the Tudor crown , indeed lucky to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she came to rule when all choices had been made and spent , all means of ruling tried . Disregarding the Lady Jane Grey , Queen for nine uncertain days , there were in one century five Tudor princes ; and the chief purpose of each was the same  --  the renewal and revival of the kingdom . Each sought to break and to end a long winter , to announce and display a season of springtime . The first , Henry VII , sought this in the literal sense , rising to rule from the blood of Bosworth Field . For the other four  --  Great Henry , Edward , Mary , Elizabeth  --  the task became multifoliate , no less literal but partaking of allegory as well . They became sowers of seeds as in the parable . Only the last , Elizabeth , sowed seed on fertile ground . Only the barren Queen reaped a bountiful harvest.  --  But she could not have imagined that any more than she could have dreamed that one day , by Providence or the satirical whims of Dame Fortune , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus , by paradox , was the one Tudor perfectly prepared to rule . The future was beyond knowing . She could build no castles there . The past had been spoken in a language beyond translating . And so she was left with the changingand inconstant present , whose common language is Mutability . She could possess the present , but only a day at a time . Who but a woman , masked with woman 's inconstancy , was so suited to preside over the present ?  --  It is true that what she accomplished was out of necessity , but to perceive necessity  --  that was her wisdom.  --  From the beginning she lacked wealth . All the wealth her grandfather had carefully garnered , her father had spent twice over . The reigns of Edward and Mary became , in accounting , a sum of debts . She had no chance to increase the wealth of the kingdom except by careful conservation and by the artful and deceptive distribution of it.  --  She had some means , to be sure . She held the power of customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wards , attainders of property and estates of traitors , and indeed the Privy Seal , which could be pointed like a cannon at some rich lord . And she could call upon her Parliament for subsidies.  --  She could not consider arranging royal marriages for their double-stringed advantage  --  peace and profit . She had only one marriage , her own , with which to bargain.  --  Nor could she consider war an investment , the merchantadventuringof princes . The price was impossible . There could be no profit from even the smallest war . Only a few princes , already rich , already endowed with military power , could considerwar in the old way . And these deceived themselves . Philip of Spain , with the wealth of an empire and the New World inp327his hands , possessing the most powerful forces by land and sea in the world , was hard pressed . When he was not spending his wealth , he was accumulating debts , forced to pawn and to borrow . The truth , evident to the Queen and a few others , was that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end , forced into war , even her victories proved to be as she must have known they would , disasters.  --  In each of the means of increasing wealth , she had a strong bit , a sharp snaffle in the mouth restraining her . She must be exceeding careful . To meddle too much with the customs , for example , could destroy the trade it sought to encourage . Monopoliesand perquisites could be sold to advantage . But she must not permit these to work ruin upon trade or to increase doubt and distrust among her people . The estates and marriages of royal wards might yield something , but nothing in proportion to her needs . The ancient Parliament of England could levy taxes and make subsidies . But they could also bargain with the prince , giving a subsidy in return for things they desire  --  including , of course , more power , more liberty . And England was the lowest taxed nation in the world . Her Parliament could change that forever , being liberal with the wealth of others . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to take advantage of this means whenever a plot was discovered and treasons were proved . But she had seen how the temptation could  --  witness her father  --  untune a mind with the discord of imaginary plots.  --  She had come to the throne with a weary people , willing to trust her because they had no choice , until she proved herself unworthy . This was her greatest credit . She must not dissipate this trust even for the general good . And she must reciprocate by demonstrating trust in them.  |  --  She must , therefore , seek new ways to earn wealth . No choice but to be frugal in all things . Yet she must not seem to be as poor as she was and thus reflect to the kingdom and a hostile world the poverty and weakness of this nation.  --  A most economical woman , our Queen . She knew prices to the penny and could have outbargained a fishwife . She could squeeze a gold half angel coin until the angel dropped his spear and fell like the groaning dragon at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gesture was worth a fortune . As when upon a progress , the baggage all loaded and ready , word came to unload and unpack . The Queen had changed her mind . And a burly carter , not knowing the Queen stood at the window above him , roared with laughter and said how , by God , now he knew the Queen to be a woman exactly like his wife . " Who is the villain who says so ? " she shouted from the window.  --  And the poor man humbly knelt.  --  Then she laughed and threw him three gold angels and wished him well.  --  A gesture worth three hundred angels to her by the time the story had been told and retold.  --  One tongue is a flame and can burn down a forest.  --  Another example : how she always managed to lose something  --  glove , garter , jewel off her dress , etc.  --  whenever she appeared in public . This thing to be snatched up at once and kept like some saint 's relic by the finder . Yet she counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carefully recorded . The profit from her carelessness far exceeded the sum of all her losses . She never lost anything of much value . A careful carelessness , to say the least.  |  --  And she was well advised by men skilled at trade and all the tricks and sleights of hand with money . Sir Thomas Gresham , for example , who saved her fortunes ; who milked Antwerp , Fleming and Spaniard alike , dry , for England and his own hungry purse ; then , in effect , moved Antwerp to London when he built the magnificent Royal Exchange with its gilt grasshopperproudly surmounting all . And he spared no money in the setting up of charities , schools , and almshouses , either . If he filled his purse in her service , his services were worth double that price.  --  Her Court cost her , thus the nation , only one third what it had cost Queen Mary . She had an annual allowance of forty thousand pounds for the Court at the beginning of her reign . Half a century later , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she refused to ask for more allowance for the Court.  --  She would summon Parliament for a subsidy she believed would be granted in the interest of all , but not in the matter of her own maintenance or the expenses of the Court.  --  She must have money of her own , that was clear enough . Though she insisted upon every economy , her demands were impossible to satisfy without a corresponding reduction of the size and the functions of the Court . Which she would not allow.  --  Consider she must maintain her royal palaces and other royal residences in good order . She built no new ones  --  surprisingin such an age of building  --  but she must preserve what had been given to her . And clustered around each of these palaceswas its own community , its life deriving from the presence of the palace . She must not stint , then , or permit the environs to wither away . Must hold residence in each and all  --  sonic were favorites , some housed bitter memories . With Coun/cil and Court , she had a household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who must be fed at groaning tables , in ostentatious abundance.  --  Her menus were joyous . Even the most fastidious strangers , who never failed to mutter at our English cooking , admitted that the foods at Court were a marvel . Her table was laid to the sound of trumpets . Then , dish by dish , some lucky yeoman of the Guard tasting all for her safety 's sake . But she seldom ate in public . This ceremony was for her Court . She dined most simply in her chambers.  --  Servants of high and low degrees must be paid for their services.  --  Though she kept a sharp eye on accounts , she turned away from corruption of her servants , high and low , thus permitting , indeed encouraging , them to fatten meager earnings with gifts and bribes , according to degree and need . Judging them by work accomplished , not by means . And expecting some share of their wealth to come to her , directly or indirectly . Finally knowing that because all were guilty , all could be dispensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold middling offices , her concern was that the affairs of bought offices should be executed with loyal dispatch . If not , another buyer could always be found . There are always more seekers of office than offices . She transmuted ambitiousmen , turning their weakness to strength . There would always be factions . Nothing could change that . But by setting each of these men on his own , able to reward and punish , able to reap for himself , she could prevent even those of the same faction and persuasion from joining too closely together . Thus men like Burghley , Walsingham , Knollys , Sir Nicholas Bacon , Leicester , etc. , though all might be strong Protestants and in/dined to favor the Puritans above the bishops of her church , still they could seldom effect any unity of purpose ; each being a man of strong character , each ambitious beyond ordinary hopes and appetites . So long as their ambitions were neither entirely frustrated nor satisfied , she could play them like chessmen.  --  She wrangled with merchants for bargains and kept expensesmodest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , but less hated than higher taxes would have been.  --  Unable to gain a bargain for wines , she outraged native vintners by buying wines more cheaply abroad . The vintners soon came around . Unable to supply the Court with the rivers of beer it consumed , she permitted the show of a Royal Brewery being built at Whitehall . The brewers saw the light.  --  She invested in seafaring ventures , modestly so as to reduceher risk ; but , for the sake of the Queen 's support , which ventures , without her support , might have been named piracy , she received a queen 's share of any profits.  --  Item : the Madre de Dios , taken by Ralegh 's men as a prize , yielded her eighty thousand pounds return on an investment of eighteen hundred pounds and the loan of two old ships.  --  Her custom of receiving and carefully cataloguing New Year 's gifts grew to be a practical kind of annual subsidy.  --  Her father had been famous for his entertainments . So was the Queen , but she preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . And nothing will equal the splendor of those masques and revels , dances and performances of plays , tournaments and celebrations . For which she furnished the royal setting , the Court , and herself.  --  More often than any prince in memory , she would go forth to grace the entertainments of the Inns of Court or , carried upon a litter by her knights , to the wedding festivities of thep332daughter or son of some servant or friend . She was godmother to scores of the children of the gentry . In all these appearances she and the Court were seen by the populace . A very inexpensive thing to do and for good return.  --  She made her royal presence felt on all the native holidays and festivals , not only the feast days of the church , but also the old English May games , Midsummer Watch and so forth , adding her Accession Day , and later , on St. Elizabeth 's Day , a festival to honor the defeat of the Spanish Armada.  --  It is true that the masques of King James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the finest of our poets , though they scarcely need the poetry of words , having the poetry of the designs , the scenes , and machinery of England 's new Merlin , Inigo Jones . He raises a curtain to such a glory of painted scenes , lit by hundreds of tiny glass lamps in the Italian fashion , as must be seen to be imagined . And there are cloud machines , wave machines , aerial devices , fountains and costumes for the masquers as never were seen in the last age . Some costumes , worn by both ladies and gentlemen , as the late Queen would never have permitted except in a painting or an arras . But the cost of the King 's marvels outweighs their grandeur . The Queen was much stronger for imagination , for richnessof words to work the magic . Her banquet house at Whitehallwas a tentative thing , propped up , repaired , useful for her reign and not much longer . Now the King must have the ingeniousMr . Jones to build him a new one of stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all the fashion since the King favors the drollery of satyrs and mermaids , bawds and furies , wild men , baboons , the magpie , crow and kite . Now a gentleman does better to portray an ass or a hog and a fine lady to bep333all feathers to her navel and all naked flesh above , if either would gain the applause of the King . The old virtues slowly vanish from the masque . And with them the spirit.  --  Queen Elizabeth built no palaces , no churches , no forts ; though after the Armada with the money of a grateful  --  and frightened  --  Parliament , she shored up and repaired some old fortifications against a second coming of Spaniards . Even the spire of St. Paul 's was not restored.  --  But she disposed of old lands and houses freely to her favorites . For one price or another . By the fashion and example set early in her reign , these lands were put to work , and old places refurbished to fit new styles . And they were well scatteredacross the counties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be prepared for her visit . So , large or small , grand or modest , the houses of the favored must be built not only to appear palatial , but , if need be , to serve as palaces for her . Each with its orderly arrangement of presence chamber , privy chamber , coffer chamber , etc.  --  Again , in return for the income of the lands and the estates , a man must spend a fortune on keeping a great house . This leaving him , still , not entirely free of necessity . Not too satisfied or too comfortable.  --  This device , more valuable and cheaper than many showy palaces of her own , brought to the English land a bright and bold appearance of grandeur and prosperity ; the great who owned them becoming like ambassadors to the counties . Requiredto spend freely , then out of necessity to develop and make use of lands and holdings or else become poor . And great houses became centers for charity , as the palaces were and castles had been . Except that these were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather , indefensible . Which , besides ad/vantage to herself , brought a sense , by appearance , of peace to the land . For who would build a grand palace with no walls  --  except windows  --  if he feared danger ?  --  Never mind that the dangers were real enough and were most feared by the very men who brought the scenery of peace and prosperity to the land . Allow , though , that whether these men began to believe the illusions they lived in or not , they were thereafter in self-interest required to protect those illusionsfrom crumbling.  --  All of which leads , as if by a winding stair , to the subject of her favorites ... .  --  Though she could not shower gold upon many , she could rewarda few grandly . These in turn  --  especially if young and ambitious  --  were compelled to spend also , to distribute wealth , to build up a following , to gain support . They must make a show of affluence commensurate with her favor . For most had nothing else except the favor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wealth and power came from . They must be both loyal and grateful out of necessity . See how she shared thereby her own condition with them . Likewise all who came to serve the favored man , to cling to his cloak , knew the origin of his fortune and the conditions of it . So a man favored by the Queen became the merchant of her favors . The Queen , not the favorite , was credited with largesse . Therefore  --  and all save foolish Essex knew this  --  their own allies , servants , and supporterswere beholden first of all to her . Loyalty to the patron existed only so long as he remained in favor . A favorite 's disgrace could empty his house overnight.  --  Moreover , she could be credited far beyond any accounting of her generosity . For there were few who were favored inp335Court who did not wish to seem more so . Affairs of a man who seemed to be in favor could prosper . The man whose affairs prospered because he was presumed to be in favor would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen . For it was inspired by her . Through these she gained credit for generosity far exceeding the truth . An occasional great giving , for all the world to marvel at , to see and envy , and this coupled with a boon here and a bone there , together with some bits and pieces of possibility , these gestures made a little money go a long way in her Court.  --  She , herself , was never loath to accept gifts or service from almost anyone of the Court or outside it , always reserving the right to examine each suit upon its merits . If they chose to see her as corruptible , conceiving her according to themselves , they could attribute injustice , when they failed to achieve their ends , to the unreasonable whims of a woman . For which she could hardly be blamed . When they succeeded , perhaps because the cause was just or their aims reasonable , they could attribute successto their own cleverness.  --  So much to be done with so little . England was ringed with enemies , hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could not build military power . She might have increased her safety somewhat , but at the risk of ruining the kingdom . And , doing so , she would have lost the favor of the people , who can not conceive of enemies until they appear in armor at the gates . Instead of armies she created a show of peace and plenty , illusory but confident ; permitting thereby , within England at least and for a time , peace and prosperity to bloom like flowers in a glass house . Her people had been saddenedand dazed by the inexplicable turns of Fortune . In thatp336final season of the Tudors , which ought to have been a leafless winter , she made an artificial springtime out of thin air.  --  From those who served her the Queen demanded the outwardand visible signs of love and loyalty . She insisted upon ceremony and flattery , as a sign of sane and reasonable behavior . Her favorites must be ardent in professions of love and loyalty ; not because she was gulled , but because it was proper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gulled three times . The Queen , like a soldier , could be gulled only once.  --  From the first of her reign the Queen had her favorites , cast in no single mold , having not much in common with each other except that each was a remarkable man . Placed in one chamber , each given simultaneous youth , health , and vigor , restored to the condition which first captured her attention , they would appear to contradict one another . Ciphers in an old account book , balanced once and discarded , they cancel each other out , becoming , in sum and balance , nothing at all.  --  It seems possible that she imagined them and that they existed only there , in the Queen 's imagination.  --  Thus any one of them could be chosen as a type for all.  --  Why not Ralegh ? He shows the qualities of contradiction she favored . And he came to favor neither at the beginning nor the end of the reign . He could never be so close to her as Leicester , never so pure and abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not as the braggart captain would have him . Nor as he seems now  --  an old man , sick and tired , in disgrace and danger , a gray shadow of himself . We must take him as he was , in that lost time , when he was in and out of the Court , from his beginnings ; seeking by imagination to see what she saw , what pleased her , what allowed her to turn to him with favor.  |  --  I can not , with the confidence of that captain , spitting out his small wisdom as if it were the core and seeds of the Original apple , speak of anything except the world I know and what was known of Ralegh there . I do not allow myself the simplicity of imagining that this or that thing , which may or may not have happened , irrevocably marked his soul like an executioner 's branding iron . I know this , though . That for all its easy shining , the Court is as fierce a field to test the mettle of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessings , as any other.  --  True , Ralegh came , like others beyond counting , to seek a place at Court . True , he managed in due time to catch her eye . And when she looked at him , she could read in him qualities she favored . He was valiant , intelligent , diverting , proud , flawed , and enigmatic . He was still young enough , singularlyhandsome , correct in fashion and manners . And , perhaps , she could appreciate a lonely reticence which was in harmony with her own.  --  His beginning was by rote . For it has been said by some wag that a man must come to Court like job and then abide there like Ulysses . Which , in part , is Ralegh 's story.  --  He came first to Court in the seventies . Another young man , a soldier back from a foreign war . One who had passed through the polishing of Lyon 's Inn of Chancery and the Middle Temple.  --  At Middle Temple he was among friends and kin , even if he lacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his and whatever he might have scrounged and looted while playing soldier in sunny Languedoc.  --  And , as well , within his little world of Devon , means or no , he came from an honorable family , whose honor went back to times before the Conquest . Whose distinction , however , was a matter of cloudy memory . The truth for him being that hep338was the youngest son of Walter Ralegh of Fardel , youngest son by the third wife . His mother was of some distinction . She was Elizabeth Champernoun , daughter of Sir Philip Champernoun and the widow of a man of note in those parts , Otho Gilbert . By whom she had borne three sons , Ralegh 's half brothers , Adrian , John , and Humphrey Gilbert . There is also an older brother with the Ralegh name  --  Carew . He was last in a family of honorable name and slight means . His best inheritance , his hope , lay in blood and kinship . For by blood and marriages he was kin to good Westcountry names  --  Carew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Drake , of course the Champernouns and Gilbert , and others.  --  There was small chance in the Court for such a man . Except for having some good kin in Devon , he was on his own to stand or to fall . He had his looks , his wits , his courage , and such shows of appearance as he could beg , borrow , or steal to give him a beginning . Further , he wore the yoke of pride . Pride which could mean nothing to most young men on the edges of the Court , his satirical , cynical , urgently ambitious peers . Others at the center , including the Queen herself , might have knowledge or recollection of his name and kin . And , true enough , the Gilberts were a little above the common pit and press of groundlings . But they could not be expected to raise him up much . At Court a man must look to his own advancement first.  --  Walter Ralegh , of Hayes Barton in the parish of East Budleigh , Devonshire , had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court.  --  Not much is known or remembered of those first fruitless years , and no wonder . For no one takes notice of a new man until after he has come to some good or grief . He must have done the usual things . For certain he wrote verses , and in 1576p339some hard satirical lines of his were published to recommend George Gascoigne 's The Steele Glass . Which is enough to speculateupon.  --  There was a friendship on several grounds . Gascoigne , a few years younger than Ralegh , was a soldier too . Had come earlier to Court from Gray 's Inn . And here 's an irony : George Gascoigne 's first patron at Gray 's Inn was that distinguished bencher , Sir Christopher Yelverton.  --  Ralegh would know something of Gascoigne 's soldiering , for Gascoigne had served under Sir Humphrey Gilbert in the Netherlands in ' 72 . Served twice there before he was captured by the Spaniards and sent back to England . Gascoigne had proved himself a man of courage , and would prove it again at the Spanish Fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English lives from the mutinous Spaniards who invaded English House.  --  But later in ' 76 Gascoigne was on the edge of the Court , publishing poems , seeking to make a name . And , give or take a button or a breath , he must have been ahead of Ralegh in the footrace toward the slippery ladder of preferment . At least he had been given more occasion for advancement . In the summer of ' 75 Gascoigne was Leicester 's man and was put to work in the creation of the festivities presented for the Queen to honor her visit to Kenilworth . He wrote parts of the spectacles and , as a player , appeared before Her Majesty , first in the part of A Savage Man and , at her farewells , as Sylvanus . And he managed to find some favor from Lord Grey . With favor from Leicester and Grey , having been noticed by the Queen , Gascoigne should have cleared idle harbor and have begun to sail with fair winds . Burghley and Walsingham took note of him . He did service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in 1577 George Gascoigne was dead.  --  Gascoigne 's story ended when he died . The friendship with Ralegh must have been deep and true , however ; for after Gascoigne'sdeath , Ralegh took over the other man 's motto , proclaiminghimself divided between two gods  --  Tam Marti Quam Mercuris . Half of peace , half of war , of healing and of force , of eloquence and action , of strength and of cunning . A proclamation , then , of bold contrarities to be resolved.  --  And Ralegh had gained , perhaps through Gascoigne , some notice of both Leicester and Grey . Both of whom he later served.  --  In 1577 Ralegh could list himself , as many with and without office did , as being " of the Court , " when he stood bail for two rowdy Devon men , his servants . He was living in the suburb of Islington . And there were already some stories of tavern brawls of his own . In one , which went the rounds , he tied the long ends of a fellow 's mustache into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the summer of 1578 Sir Humphrey Gilbert received a patent to settle with Englishmen any lands in the New World " not actually possessed of any Christian prince or people , " allowinghim six years to find and to settle lands overseas . Sir Humphrey drew into this adventure his brothers , Adrian and Sir John , and to assist him his half brothers Carew and Walter Ralegh . Gascoigne had also invested before he died.  --  One partner in the venture , Sir Humphrey 's chief support , Henry Knollys , was son of Sir Francis Knollys , the Queen 's Treasurer of the Household . But before they had well begun , Knollys deserted this for privateering in closer waters.  --  At the end of November of ' 78 , just the worst time for a crossing , Sir Humphrey Gilbert set out with seven ships . One ofp341them , old and leaky , was the Falcon , commanded by Walter Ralegh and mastered by Simon Fernandez , the Portuguese pilot . Storms and other troubles caused Gilbert 's venture to fail . His ships were scattered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in the Falcon to try his luck at privateering . Did not return to England until May of ' 79.  --  I know nothing of his nautical affairs and care less , except as they illuminate his shadowy early life at the Court ; but there is some urgency in the man who will take an old ship , his first command , alone for six months , risking everything on the venture . There must have been nothing tugging him back to Court . And he could not afford to have the adventure come to nothing . Perhaps on his voyage he gained something , enough to offset his losses , but it could not have been much . He was fortunate to bring back the Falcon afloat and to be alive.  --  By early 158o he was making his mark in another way  --  and the worst way to please the Queen . Was called before Counciland committed to Fleet prison , for a week , for coming to swords with Sir Thomas Perrot . Not long after he was again in a brawl at the tennis court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshalsea.  --  Nothing unusual , except that he was able to survive an unhappy reputation . There were many in the Court who foolishlylooked for renown as ruffians . It is always easy to pick a quarrel or begin a brawl . And these rogues of Court , those who lived long enough , vanished forever . Both Queen and Councilwere adamant against permitting her Court to become a cockpit.  --  Most curious is why Walter Ralegh fell to playing this game . In his writings he has ridiculed the courtier 's habit of dueling . And later he proved himself able to exercise restraintp342in the face of provocation . It may be he had given up all hope at Court by then . A younger crop of courtiers was already blooming . His chances had passed him by.  --  By the summer of 158o he was gone . Back to the craft of warfare . Off to Ireland as the captain of a company of foot soldiers.  --  There his fortunes took a turn for the better , for when he came back to Court it was as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Walsingham as well . He returned in time for the Christmas Revels of ' 8i.  --  No doubt in the world but William Cecil , Lord Burghley , had an eye upon him too . Which was Cecil 's duty and selfinterest . But it was the eye of quiet suspicion . Like a good clerk , he was aware of Ralegh 's motley record and the signs of contradiction in him . Would be alert , but far too careful to interfere yet with a young man of tentative promise , especially before the man had gained anything . Wisdom and experience taught Burghley , who endured like a willow , by bending , through the times of Edward and Mary , to stand tall and transformed now , like an oak , that to sound premature alarms is a waste of time . Young men , even if they did happen to catch the Queen 's eye and please her , came and went , blossomed , then faded like May 's meadow flowers . Burghley knew that if Ralegh did not capture the Queen 's interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were always others . And he judged that neither Leicester nor Walsingham would advance any man they had any reason to fear themselves . Their separate interest in Ralegh was , therefore , reassuring.  --  Suppose he did attract the attention of the Queen ? He would gain a rung or two upon that slippery Jacob 's ladder atp343Court . Chances were he would be left there to hang on for as long as he was able.  --  All misjudged him , Walsingham , Leicester , and Burghley . More important , they misjudged the Queen.  --  Within a few weeks after his return , Ralegh had been noticed by the Queen . She singled him out of a crowd for a moment of recognition during one of her Sunday processions.  --  A public notice of his existence and a few words .. .  --  A sign that she found him pleasing and that he might be watched . No great shakes of a lamb 's tail . Many men labored long at schemes and good works , spending themselves poor in service to gain nothing more than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he could have expected . And , in justice , had he never received another sign of favor from the Queen , it would have been sufficient . Not to his ambitions , of course , but in the scale of things at Court.  --  All misjudged Walter Ralegh . They misjudged the Queen also . Not perceiving that she had now ruled for nearly twenty years . And what that meant.  --  Her early favorites were older . Beginning of stiffness in the joints of nimble Sir Christopher Hatton . Who had danced into favor when dancing was her best cordial . All were older ; though she would not , could not hold up a mirror glass for them to see it . She , too , would be caught in that cold reflection.  --  As Queen she could justify her impulse to find a new favorite . Besides which she was a woman , and she could not soothe her mixed feelings , of content and discontent , of thanksgivingand vague dread , like any milkmaid who can buy a new bonnet at the fair . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |  --  Here was a full-grown man , a proud soldier , being put forwardby her counselors . Worth looking at.  --  In a short time , by spring of 1582 , there was no doubt that Walter Ralegh had stepped into the charmed , inmost circle close to the Queen . The next bestowal was a nickname . Walter Ralegh became Water , and sometimes Wit or Oracle.  --  Old favorites itched with anxiety . Which flattered her.  --  And now the world was suddenly all promises for Ralegh , of everything or nothing . His deep-grained satirical sense let him bear uncertainty . He could make light of it , and she would understand that and take it for a compliment.  --  About that time , on a spring day , the Queen and a party were walking in the gallery of the palace.  --  He stopped walking and went to a window , where he busied himself by writing on a pane with a diamond . He wrote : " Fain would I climb , yet fear I to fall . "  --  Turned to find the Queen standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the diamond from him . She wrote the second line in answer : " If thy heart fail thee , climb not at all . "  --  Without a word she turned and rejoined her group , leaving him kneeling , smiling to himself.  --  The Queen kept the diamond.  --  For the next ten years he was showered with rewards and favor . And even after the disgrace of his marriage and his time in the wilderness , there were more.  --  In a marvelous short time Walter Ralegh was a man of wealth . Among the rewards she bestowed upon him were two estates from All Souls College ; the monopoly patent to license the selling of wines and to exact fines in this capacity ; other monopolies , including , aptly , one upon the traffic in playing cards ; a license to export woolen broadcloth ; Durham Housep345on the river ; the whole estate of Sherbourne in Dorset ; fortytwothousand acres of land in Ireland along the River Blackwater , in Cork and Waterford  --  and at that time by statute law no man was allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  including nine castles , properties in and around the town of Youghal , and Lismore Castle ; a license to export any and all commodities from Munster whether or not there were legal restrictions ; and when Anthony Babington died for his plot against the Queen and forfeited his estate , Babington'slands and property in Nottingham , Lincoln , and Derby went to Ralegh . Ralegh also received a patent to explore and to make colonies in any part of the New World not already in the possession of a Christian kingdom and the rights to control all access to any settlement he should found there.  --  He was knighted by the Queen , who was frugal with this honor.  --  Among offices and titles Ralegh held were these : Captain of the Guard , Lord Warden of the Stanneries , Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall , Vice-Admiral of Devon and Cornwall , Ranger of Gillingham Forest , Captain of Portland Castle , and Governor of the Island of Jersey.  --  He was possessed of the wealth and power of many of the nobility and with the possibility of using it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished , like a dog with a bone , settle for the present satisfaction and defend it . Which satisfaction was , in truth , more than even a child 's falcon-free imagination could comprehend.  --  Pain and poverty and thwarted ambition , which are the lot of most creatures , whether they live at Court or a barn , can break the virtues like brittle bones . But it is also true that good fortune can jar and shake a man 's soul . For , most remarkable ofp346all , he was free . Changed or not , he was , upon the whim of another , freed of all he had imagined himself to be.  --  Consider that for the favorite , even as the head-whirling intoxication of favor released him from many bondages , it forged new fetters . For what had been given to him could , in like fashion , with the same absence of warning or justice , be  --  The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away . Blessed be the name of the Lord  --  withdrawn.  --  Now he was studied by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every word and action noted , glossed for hidden meaning . Raised above others , he must pay a dear price ; lonely when most public ; rich , yet belonging to others : all others who , clinging to the figure of justice , as sailors , they say , will hang on for life to a gloating chest or broken spar , examine him for any signs of virtue which might justify his fortune . Likewise , more close and intent , solemn as a jeweler searching a stone for flaws , yet calm , too , like poised cats studying the antics of a wounded bird they watched and waited for signs of weakness which might betray him . Walter Ralegh proved no miserly guardian of new fortunes . He was willing to risk it all upon adventures . He spent of his wealth as if , like the deepest well , it could never run dry.  --  This was a secular act of faith in which the Queen was well pleased . It pleased others at Court for other reasons . By his blithe disregard he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to fall as far as he had been raised.  --  Yet , as if sharing a secret with the Queen , as if in leagueand conspiracy with her , he knew these things , and they did nottrouble him . Vulnerability never taught him to be humble . Rather it increased his indifference , up to the edge of impudence.  --  He seldom pressed suit for himself , but he took pleasurep347in seeking favor for others , high and low ; especial pleasure , no doubt , in making suit for his onetime master and better  --  the Earl of Leicester.  --  Once in the presence of a crowd he knelt before the Queen and asked some favor for a friend . " When , Sir Walter , will you cease to be a beggar ? " the Queen demanded . " When Your Gracious Majesty ceases to be a benefactor , " he said.  --  She laughed and granted the suit.  --  On another occasion , that sassy little Mr. Richard Tarlton , the celebrated comedian , was performing . And , noticing Ralegh beside the Queen whispering into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapped his hands as loud as an arquebus and leveled an accusing finger at Ralegh . " See ! " he cried out . " See how the knave commands the Queen ! "  --  Ralegh laughed out loud . And the Queen corrected Tarlton with a gentle frown.  --  And all the while Ralegh was spending his wealth upon ventures and the voyages he could not make , being required to remain at Court . He became an equal and generous patron to the new learning and to our antiquarians . He gave comfort to scholars and artisans and limners . A gentleman of means is known by these things . The books which are dedicated to him are the witnesses of affluence . Printed books acknowledge Ralegh'spatronage and interest in history , geography and cartography , medicine , antiquities , and the natural philosophies such as chemistry . He was a patron of music and even John Case 's Praise of Music calls him a lover of good music and a skilled musician . His portraits , from a proper early miniature by Nicho/las Hilliard to the final one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much interested in and knowing of fashions in painting . He hired the artist John White to join with Thomas Harriot in depicting , by words and pictures , the new world of Virginia . He spent a lavish sum to support the English publicationof the drawings of James Morgues.  --  Two great natural philosophers , Harriot and Dr. John Dee , were more friends than servants , and assisted him in his studies of chemistry , astronomy , mathematics , geography , shipbuilding and navigation.  --  A poet himself , he was recognized as one of the finest of the gentlemen poets , whose work was seldom published but widely known in manuscripts . As early as 1589 his repute was sufficient for him to be singled out by George Puttenham in The Arte of English Poesie : " For dittie and amorous Ode I finde Sir Walter Rawleyghs vayne most loftie , insolent and passionate . "  --  But if he was known and respected for his verses among the poets of Court , from Sidney to Harrington , he was surprisingfor the divers poets he patronized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christopher Marlowe , Ben Jonson , George Chapman , Francis Beaumont , and John Fletcher . More than patron , he mingled with poets and scribblers , taking as much pleasure in an evening at the Mermaid as a night at Court . By circumstance he can never have been close to Mr. William Shakespeare , who was servant to both Essex and Southampton , but he must have known him at the Mermaid and elsewhere , for Ralegh haunted the playhouses . Was closest of all to Edmund Spenser , whose holdings at Kilcolman were near to Ralegh 's Irish estates . Spenser wrote of Ralegh in " Colin Clout 's Come Home Again " and allegorically in The Faerie Queene . For which great work Ralegh produced a dedicatoryp349poem . It was Ralegh who first introduced Spenser at Court and managed to secure a pension for him.  --  Curious , whenever Ralegh found himself unable to patronize these men , he found other patrons for them including some among his enemies.  --  It was not difficult for enemies to turn this patronage and friendship with learned men , poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , he sometimes made use of poets to serve his turn , to promote enterprises or to satirize rivals . These things could be answered , thrust and counterthrust . But his friendships with these men , especially the nature of their discussions and disputations , his experiments with new instruments and theories in natural philosphy , were to prove more dangerous . Easy for the envious to conceive that their privacy was secrecy . Easy enough to trouble the superstitious and the unlearned with rumors of their doings.  --  So long as he was in the Queen 's favor , he was secure . Yet his indifference to Court opinion and popular gossip made him a fine standing target for satire.  --  Though he never set new styles of dress or affected foppish fashions , his clothing was priceless . Every courtier wore his fortuneon his back , like a gaudy snail , and so did Ralegh . When he had no fortune , this was common enough to be ignored ; but when he was rich , his show of pearls and jewels was taken to be proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them all.  --  Once he appeared in a splendid and original costume of black and white only , sprinkled with countless pearls . It was so like , as if cut from the same magic bolt of cloth , a gown the Queen was wearing , that they appeared like twins together . When he first astonished her with this costume , she laughedp350and embraced him . Any woman who had dared such a thing would have been boxed about the ears in a trice . And most men , even among their favorites , would have been sent off to enjoy a long season of English country life . His impudence differs from that gesture of Essex at the tiltyard . Essex 's jest was for the crowd ; Ralegh 's , though public , was more like a secret shared with the Queen . He courted no favor but hers.  --  There was always some self-satire in his mirth . Once , another time of the tiltyard , when rumor was he had suffered some misfortune or disgrace , Ralegh came riding out of the gate of Durham House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essex , making a show of the number of his retainers , but himself clad entirely in armor made of silver.  --  From these occasions and many others I conclude the Queen was willing to permit him to play the conny-catcher to the world of connies , to gull his rivals , to equivocate , to take on almost any role or pose he fancied . What she demanded in return was an absolute , unflagging loyalty and trust.  --  If so , then he was bound , sooner or later , to betray himself and fail her.  --  Later in 1591 he secretly married Elizabeth Throckmorton , one of the Queen 's maids of honor . In March of ' 92 , while Ralegh was elsewhere , freed from the confines of Court by the war with Spain , preparing an expedition to strike the Spanish Indies /Iota and the Isthmus of Panama , his firstborn son , Damerei , was christened , the Earl of Essex serving as godfather . Within a month Bess Throckmorton returned to Court and resumedher duties . By May Ralegh had been recalled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken against him.  --  It was not until August that the Queen acted , orderingp351Ralegh and his wife committed to the Tower . The rumor of the marriage had been bruited about Court for some time , and Ralegh had denied it to his friends , succeeding only in arousing more speculation . The Queen must have known the truth for a long time.  --  Never mind that at Court there was much outward wise nodding and inward rejoicing at his fall . All that mattered , in truth , was the Queen 's action . She had waited , it seems , for him to confess the truth , to submit to her justice , to beg her pardon . Others , even proud Essex , had done so , and had received the Queen 's forgiveness.  --  Ralegh knew this , but he did not , would not play the part required of him . Months before he had been only a step away from being sworn to the Council and close to receiving a title to nobility . Now he was in the Tower , having lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play roles , but he would not perform the one which would save him from disgrace.  --  Much was made then , while she lived , and ever since , about the Queen 's jealousy of her favorites . And no doubt , like any woman , she could be jealous , even though by that time in her life  --  she was nearing her sixtieth year  --  jealousy was a familiar experience to her . As Queen , however , her reaction must be shock , disbelief , followed by anger and disappointment.  --  Her half dozen maids of honor were young ladies of distinction , her closest and most intimate companions . She had them dressed , usually , all in white , and they were with her everywhere , like the nymphs of Diana . In due time she found them husbands , attended their weddings , was godmother for their children , etc . But until that time came , they were dutyboundto her , in chastity and obedience . And they were , as ifp352they were her own daughers , required to have her permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her maids while they served her . Their failures were her own.  --  Bess Throckmorton meant something more to her . She was the daughter of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton , who had died in the Queen 's service in 1571 . He had known Elizabeth since she was a young girl , a princess of ambiguous status in the household of Catherine Parr . When , in the clouds of confused suspicion following Wyatt 's Rebellion , the Princess Elizabeth was sent to the Tower , so was Throckmorton . When Elizabeth came to the throne , Sir Nicholas became one of her men , serving her in peculiarly delicate duties and offices , especially in diplomaticmissions to France and Scotland . He was one of the first of her master intelligencers , creating a network of agents and spies , one which both Walsingham and Burghley could not only use , but refine into England 's first line of defense . When Sir Nicholas had died , Sir Francis Walsingham wrote of him : " For be it spoken without offense to any , for council in peace and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiency his successor that I know . "  --  The Queen was sensible of her obligations to the Throckmortonsand that she had failed them . More to the point , she was aware that two people close to her had broken faith , and , worse , had been able , for a time at least , to keep their secret ; and then to imagine they could keep it longer . Breakingof faith is grave enough . For therein lies the gravest danger to all kingdoms , long before enemies arrive upon shores and borders . But , even so , the Queen had cause to believe that she knew Ralegh . Chastened , sufficiently frightened , he might learn something out of failure , perhaps a clearer definition of loyalty.  |p353If  the prodigal returned , seeking pardon , he would be welcomed.  --  On the other hand , England was at war , more threatened than ever before . The life of the Queen depended upon knowledge , imagination , cunning , and faith in herself . Now she must question her own judgment . Self-doubt was compounded when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and apparently believing she could deceive the Queen . And Ralegh , a man of forty years wise in worldly matters , made no move to repent or to avert the Queen 's anger . Either he had , indeed , lost his wits , or he no longer cared what the Queen thought , what she might do , or what he might lose.  --  To the astonishment of all , Ralegh was confined only a brief time in the Tower , then freed to go and do as he pleased , though banished from Court . Her punishment was strangely mild . He had not lost his offices and perquisites , not even the captaincy of the Guard , which she kept vacant.  --  Deprived of none of his blessings , though cut off from advancement , Ralegh continued his various activities , spent as free and lived as grand as before.  --  He built up his estates in England and Ireland . Made of his new seat at Sherbourne not only a most profitable holding  --  five thousand a year it earned him though very few , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand manor worthy of comparison with any.  --  He made the voyage of exploration to Guiana in ' 95 , claimingit for the Queen . And wrote a popular book about that adventure  --  The Discoverie of the Large , Rich and Bewti f ul Em pyre of Guiana , published in ' 96.  --  He served , with the outspoken independence which was his consistent stance before and after , in the vexing Parliamentp354of ' 93 . Speaking out for the Queen 's interests in such matters as the subsidy , but most eloquently arguing against the repressiveacts which Archbishop Whitgift  --  thus the Queen , who called Whitgift her " black husband " and raised him to the Council  --  was determined to impose upon both Catholic recusantsand rebellious Puritans . Though he was no longer Senior Knight of Devon in Commons , having no more distinction than to represent the Cornish borough of St. Michaels , he was a powerfulpresence in that Parliament . The Commons in ' 93 was more than half composed of new men . Chaotic , troublesome , threatenedand browbeaten , subjected to many pressures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this Parliament that a small number of men distinguished themselves by resistance to the proposed excesses and by a defense of the hard-earned rights and privileges of the Commons . Walter Ralegh was one of the leaders , as was the Speaker , Solicitor General Edward Coke . . . .  --  As a result , he came under the suspicion of atheism , together with some friends and servants . The most vulnerable , Christopher Marlowe , was killed in a tavern brawl by two agents of the Archbishop . No doubt a warning to the others . And an ecclesiastical High Commission was formed to examine the suspicion of Ralegh 's atheism . Ralegh did not deign to attendtheir sessions . Nothing came of the charges , except laughter at the expense of some pompion-headed preachers . And he was so little frightened that he made a mockery of false piety by making a great show of the same himself . When he returned from Guiana in ' 95 , he announced to the world that he had " seen the wonders of the Lord in the ocean deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dull , interminable sermons at St. Paul 's , the very model of outward humility.  |  --  And this gesture proved  --  to Queen , Court , and the Archbishop , if not to the populace  --  that he had not changed a whit . Good fortune or bad , he would be himself , no other.  --  In June of ' 97 he was accepted back at Court , resuming his captaincy , much as if five years had never happened . And though he was unlikely to advance much higher , he was again to be feared and distrusted , therefore hated . As much as before.  --  Other favorites rose higher , but none were luckier or more trusted by the Queen.  --  For those who looked for justice , it did not fall on Ralegh . Strict justice was reserved for his wife.  --  Elizabeth Throckmorton , tall , blond , fair of skin , handsome in a strong and asymmetrical way , trim of figure and shapely of limb , could have done much worse by herself from among the men of Court . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could not blame her for that , though , like a woman , she charged her with any seduction . What did this young woman know of anything ? She was too young , too spoiled and safe to imagine the knave beneath silk and jewels . She might have him naked in her arms , as the Queen could never do , but she could live forever and never know him truly , truly naked , as the Queen did . The Queen might even have pitied her.  --  Except that Elizabeth Throckmorton , having had her pleasure , and keeping her secret , returned to the service of the Queen as if nothing had happened.  --  Which meant that Elizabeth Throckmorton believed or allowed herself to hope that Elizabeth , the Queen , was only a stupid old woman.  --  Elizabeth Throckmorton could never be forgiven for this assumption . And  --  it pleased the Queen to know this  --  shep356would never know why . She was too vain to admit the truth to herself.  --  Angry , disappointed , jealous , hurt , yes ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . To be what she was , for better or worse . First and always , Queen of England.  --  After five years out of the center , Ralegh returned to serve the Queen for the rest of her reign.  --  Within weeks of the death of the Queen , Ralegh was rudely stripped of his offices , perquisites , monopolies . Within a few months he was a convicted traitor , a plot beyond testing for truth or falsehood . His Court was the Tower , where he should have been out of sight and out of mind . But for fourteen years , from those walled acres , he managed to trouble the King . Famousmen from England and abroad , even Indian chieftains from the New World , visited him . Crowds came to watch silentlywhen he walked the walls for exercise . He won the friendship of Queen Anne and the young Prince Henry , who would have freed him if the prince had lived . " Who but my father would keep such a bird in a cage ! " the young Prince exclaimed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sherbourne , perhaps a more suitable place than the Tower to wait for pardon or freedom . Sherbourne , which had been taken by a legal trick , devised by Cecil , so that the King could give it to his current favorite  --  Robert Carr . And all through those years Ralegh nettled and needled the King with his writings  --  TheHistory of the World , written for Prince Henry , and which the King wanted suppressed because it was " too sawcy with kings , " together with a rash of pamphlets in manuscript on subjects from the art of shipbuilding to " The Prerogative of Parliaments , " each and all offensive to His Majesty 's views.  --  Finally Ralegh was freed to prepare and make his voyagep357to Guiana . Ralegh was set free earlier than had been planned so his apartments could be used for the culprits in the Overburypoisoning . He left upon a sudden warrant , so swiftly , or conveniently , that he had to come back to gather the last of his books and papers . And thus met , briefly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvelously ignorant Robert Carr , now ViscountRochester , Earl of Somerset , and now no longer the King 's favorite , but a felon , charged in the scandalous poisoningof Sir Thomas Overbury . Carr , who had taken Sherbourne from Ralegh and had spurned even to answer Ralegh 's measuredand humble letter pleading for it . Met Robert Carr at last in the Tower , himself the free man and Carr the prisoner . Surely he did not really need to return for his books and papers . He could have sent his servants . But he went back to fetch them himself , making it clear even to cloudy-witted Carr.  --  Ralegh was a figure of cold courtesy , soft-spoken , sad-faced , indeed almost apologetic for intruding upon Carr 's misfortune . Which could not fail to drive Carr into a fit of rage . Ralegh accomplished that with ease , assuming the satiric role of the former owner of these grounds at the Tower , instructing Carr in ways and means to make life there more tolerable . " You shall find it comfortable enough as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your jess and hood and bells , " he told Carr . " Indeed , should it be your misfortune to remain here as long as I have , or for the rest of your natural life , you will find many blessings to be thankful for . "  --  Carr said nothing , but his eyes blinked and there was a dark cloud on his face . Which , of course , led Ralegh to continue offering good advice . " Above all , sir , you must not squander thoughts or good spirits upon what might have been . Nor regret what you have lost . Ifp358you must think of the past , as we all must do , think upon those who , in this selfsame place , have suffered so much more and lingered long . " " I need no counsel from you ! " Carr said , not able to contain himself longer . " Perhaps not , " Ralegh said . " Then consider that you are free to ignore my counsel , as any man is so free . Have you not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been times when you yourself have ignored the counsel of others . For example , I am certain you can not always have concurred with your late lamented secretary , Sir Thomas . . . " " God 's blood and wounds ! " Carr roared , raising the heads of servants in the room and catching the ears of the many others who were curious about the encounter . " Christ on the Cross ! I 'd kill you if I could ! " " Oh , sir , " Ralegh answered , " you must not curse and think of murder any more . Rather be thankful . In the olden times in England they would have boiled you alive for poisoning , you and your handsome Lady Frances too . " " By God , I will kill you with my bare hands ! " " Would you strike an old man ? Shame ! " " If I were free  --  and mark you , old Fox , I may be free one day soon enough , " Carr said , still so choked with rage he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd have my honor at swords ' points . "  --  Very softly then : " Which is the only place , sir , you shall have honor , as a rogue with a weapon . " " Damn your black heart to hell , old man ! "  --  And soft still : " Old it is true . But mark you , sir , I shall never be so old or frail that I could not spit the likes of you on the pointp359of a rapier like a poor sparrow . I would cut you clean from your high beard to your lower one , where all your brains dangle . . . . " " Begone , you upstart rogue and beggar ! Begone and may you die soon ! "  --  Carr turning away , black as a Moor , an ebony face on the edge of apoplexy.  --  And Ralegh : " One word and no more , " speaking to his back . " In my study of history , I could find no precedent for our altered status . Where in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner able to purchase his freedom while the favorite of his bosom stands in the wreath of the halter . But now I have remembered an example  --  Mordecai and Haman . Look up thestory . You shall have ample time to read . I did .... "  --  Ralegh turned , smiling , and left at the head of his servants . Hearing , as he did so , the shift of Carr 's feet on the stone , the swish and whisper of his clothing , as he too turned . Unable to curse . Unable to run away from torment . Forced to turn and watch the back of Ralegh 's head as he left him . And Ralegh not needing to look back again for the proof of what mind 's eye showed him clear as a portrait . A fierce face , lined with outrage , but strangely weak and harmless , almost pitiable for the bright welling-up of tears in the eyes.  --  To whip Robert Carr naked from Tower to Westminster Hall could have given Ralegh less satisfaction.  --  The Court of the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding . That much , at least , was our discipline . Those rituals became our purpose . And we were all actors in a quiet play , like one of John Lily 's , performing for ourselves , our only audience . Elsewhere seed was sown , grain grew and was harvested . Elsewhere ships swallowed the wind and sailed over the edges of the world . Elsewhere merchantsp360waxed fat and rich or died in debt . Poor rogues roamed the roads and slept beneath hedges . Elsewhere , as ever , sheep were fleeced and slaughtered for tables.  --  It might be said , and not entirely as satire , that we practicedfor the leisure of eternity by enjoying a portion of it here and now.  --  The Court of the King is more extravagant and correspondinglyrude . Blame it , as they do , on his hungry flea- and lousebittenScottish lords who came down like a flock of raucous crows ; nevertheless the way of the Court is largely our own doing . With suddenly rewards beyond imagining or asking there for the plucking and taking , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly the King , there is a piquant urgency to our fleecing ; now or never , it seems ; with many of the old formalities and rituals which served the Queen discarded to be replaced by grander pageants and gaudier games ; with the King by his tippling setting the literal example while we stumble foolish drunk and besotted , if not in flesh then in spirit ; the old center is gone , vanishing so easily it might never have been , and no man can know how long the present humming and whirling will endure.  --  Just at a time when many good servants were gone , the plain fact of service fell upon us , who had lost even the charm of our indifference . The King takes the sense of the Court he was given without ever learning the hidden sentence . He knows the letter , but he can not read it . The spirit is a mystery to him.  --  To publish the letter of the Queen 's Court is to report nothing of the truth . Lacking an inner spirit , either to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it seems to he.  --  You will have heard of banquets turning into riot , wherep361the rush and press of crowds causes tables and silver and glasses to be overthrown . Foods and sauces and wines , bread and wasted salt , mingling in a rich paste , to splatter our clothes , until we look like weary travelers from the country of Gluttony . It is true . . . .  --  Read report of the King crudely butchering a fallen stag , his doublet clotted with gore and excrement.  --  Perhaps you know the account which Harrington once gave of the visit to England of Christian of Denmark . When the two kings vomited at table and were carried off snoring to bed . When the three Court ladies , as Faith , Hope , and Charity in the masque , were too dazed and drunk to stand and deliver their lines.  --  What this means and signifies is  --  itself . We rush to the banquet table , pigs in silk and satin , destroying as much as we swill and devour . As if the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became Circe instead and turned our whole crew to swine . Faith , Hope , and Charity are knock-kneed and sweatingdrunk and can not recall their lines . A peace-loving King has innocent blood up to both elbows . Idleness is now deadly serious . Men die of it and the good  --  Prince Henry , for example  --  die young.  --  The Court the Queen left behind her was an apple , red and ripe , polished to a high luster . Down came the King from Scotland , hungry as a wolf . Bit into that apple with joy . To taste no sweetness , only dust and rot and worms . If he has never fully recovered , well , few men do so when the dreams of a lifetime prove false.  --  But all of that , even this  --  the old man sleeping in the upper chamber of Westminster 's gatehouse  --  is epilogue to a play whichp362ended long ago . Ralegh 's last glory , his final triumph came in the last years of the Queen.  --  To speak of the last times of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptian upon one bank , the other among the fleeing Jews ; the former outraged and dismayed , shaking mailed fists ; the latter dancing for joy , biting their thumbs at erstwhile masters . Safely separated by a sea which first miraculouslydivided for the scampering mob , then closed again to drown Pharaoh 's army.  --  This figure applies well to a single man , divided from himself by a sea of time.  --  Would the Jews have rejoiced and followed their prophet had they dreamed of the forty years of wandering in wilderness that lay before them ?  --  And the Egyptians , all worldly power and glory and pure frustration on the shore . Perhaps a vision of the harsh future of the Jews would have offered some solace , but was at that instant supremely irrelevant . I do conceive , however , that they might have sighed in mighty relief if they had known that with those Jews went also all the plagues and troubles they had suffered , that , in truth , their own power and glory would remain untarnished . At the loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  My meaning is contained in that figure . All history is a sort of recollection , but between us and the things remembered flows a division of time , once crossed over blithely , but now unfordable . So it is with the life of a man , his chronicle of recollection . As you imagine me , so I must imagine myself.  --  After the death of the Queen , something occurred in this kingdom which now seems final , so absolute it is a sea which divides us forever from ourselves . But then it was a cause forp363celebration ; no ending but a new beginning ; a birth , disguised as death , whose name would be hope.  --  To speak of the last times now is to be janus-faced . And the truth of it is lost in something deeper than the sea . . . .  --  In those days the problem seemed simple . The Queen had lived and reigned too long.  --  After a high tide of glory , the defeat of the Spanish Armada in a year of wonders , all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war with Spain we pressed to no advantage , and the war went on , piecemeal nibbling the wealth , substance , and will of the kingdom . There were small actions of no apparent value or consequence . There were false flares of hope , like the sacking of Cadiz in ' 96 , great stratagems which failed . Meanwhile there were ceaseless musters and alarms . Englishmen died in France , the Netherlands , Ireland , and at sea . They returned , maimed or whole , to swell the ranks of vagrant , masterless men . Or they deserted in droves at the ports even before they embarked.  --  Spain was growing ever more powerful and was on all sides against us : stirring rebels in Ireland ; supporting the CatholicLeague in France , and occupying ports there ; in Scotland plotting and conniving ; causing disruption of trade with the German cities and even with Poland ; working as well within England by secret agents , her Jesuits , to stir up discontents and to keep hope alive among hard-pressed Papists.  --  The orderly trade of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising prices , times of near famine ; there were outbreaks and riots as grievances grew . And then the Plague came to England.  --  The Queen was old and still the question of her succession was unsettled.
