txt Chicago Tribune Press Service CHAPPAQUA , N. Y. ? DeWitt Wallace , the 87-year-old founder of the Reader 's Digest , was at a party for . stiff ' veterans last November when he dropped a Christmas bombshell . After some remarks about the nice job everyone bad been doing , he  --  mmounced cost-of-living salary increases of 6 per cent for employes making $40,000 or less and 3 per cent for those making more than that , plus a straight raise of 5 per cent for everybody . And yes , the Usual , 15 per cent bonus would also be paid . The raises were for all 3,800 Digest employes in the United States , 2,800 of whom work here in garden-surrounded Georgian-style headquarters that Mrs. Wallace ' designed and furnished with antiques and paintings by Van Gogh , Modigliani , Matisse , et al . Foreign units were for the other 6,000 employes . When the young new Digest ; managers figured the unexpected package into their budget , they noted that Wallace , as always , had had a practical - base far action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history in 1976 . The U.S. edition of the magazine , with 18 million circulation , bad record advertising revenue . The foreign editions , in 13 languages , have 12 million circulation . THE WALLACES own all the voting stock . The masthead states that they retired in 1973 . " They say they 're retired , only we lmow better , " said a staffer . " If you 're projecting for a year and all of a sudden the pay roll is up by 11 per cent , you have to admit he 's involved , " said another . ? Wallace still strides briskly into his office , answers his own phone , views every article going into the magazine . Sometimes he sends an article back with the notation that he 's not involved in approving articles anymore . But just as often , he writes suggestions on the proofs . Mrs. Wallace , slowed now by having . to use a walker , continues to choose the cover art , among other chores . THE WALLACES have never let their magazine publicize themselves , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their " retirement " seems to have had // Column 1 Pay is n't condensed at Reader 's Digest // more credibility outside the magazine . Last February , the New York Times made reference to " the late DeWitt Wallace . " The Times later apologized for the slaying , which drew from Wallace the following staff memo : " Here we are in the glorious ' Out Yonder , ' looking over your shoulders and applauding the work you are doing , just as we did in our previous incarnation . We are happy , too , to be able .. to confirm the findings of psychic research proving the reality of communication with those who have passed on to another world . " Happy days to you . " The late DW and LEW " THE EDITORS of the Reader 's Digest say Wallace is doing more work than he thinks he does , and they continue to make tactful use of him . Although Mrs. Wallace describes him as a " very shy " person , It is known that he ca n't resist commenting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to write replies to Christmas greetings , discussing the cards . It is certainly no recent development for him to simply stand up and announce what he wantNto do , as with the surprise raises . Talking to employes in 1963 , he unexpectedly announced that from then on the Digest would shut down on Fridays in May . He had determined that the May workload was relatively light and thought it a good time to do some pioneering in the four-day week . And it was n't long before a couple of those three-day weekends were being used for company-subsidized tours . The Wallaces see their company as a sort of pilot project in improving the quality of life  --  but always with punctuality . The work day is 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m . The Digest Provides buses to carry employes from as far away as Danbury , Conn. , and Yonkers , N.Y. , to work and home again for a mere 20 cents per trip . Employes are reimbursed for half the tuition of courses not related to their jobs and all of it for job-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for membership in an organized athletic program such as a tennis club . WALKING BACK to work from the Digest 's guest house one day , Wallace noticed some trappings of privilege he did n't like . A few executives had put up " reserved " signs in the parking lot , and the practice had proliferated . The parking hierarchy was beginning to resemble that of a military base . Wallace wiped it out with a word . Coming from him , quick decisions are quickly accepted . In 1935 Wallace talked to a garage owner about gruesome auto wrecks . ' , Then he ordered up the terrible " ? And Sudden Death , " most famous magazine article ever published . The Digest 's best-known crusade is against cigarets . The latest installment is a two-part series about their " poison gases , " the result of a study showing levels of carbon monoxide in the smoke of leading brands . The magazine has published 67 articles on the hazards of smoking , the first of them in 1924 . Its stories on tar and nicotine led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1964 report and brought about improvement in filters . Even the first issue of the Digest , in February , 9922 , had a one-liner on the subject  --  a quote from Billy Sunday 's choir leader ; " One cigaret will kill a cat . " DeWitt Wallace got the idea for the Reader 's Digest while recovering from shraptel wounds suffered in World War I. His motivation was bolstered by his 1921 marriage to Lila Acheson , a social worker  --  and his being fired by Westinghouse . The legend on the first issue was : Thirty-one articles each month from leading magazines  --  each article of enduring value and interest , in condensed and compact form . The young couple lived in Greenwich Village and worked around the clock , selecting , condensing , editing . When enough provisional subscriptions had been drummed up by Wallace 's directmail and personal solicitation , they ordered 5,000 copies printed . They rented a basement room under , a speakeasy at No. 1 Minetta Lane in the Village and stuffed-envelopes with the aid of the speakeasy 's patrons and girls from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off Like a rocket . By the fall of 1922 , the Wallaces were able to lead , by a few- decades , the march to the suburbs . They rented a hollyhock-lined garage apartment in Pleasantville , N.Y. , along with a pony sbed to serve as an office : By 1936 the Digest had ' overflowed Pleasantville . Eighty acres were purchased in the wooded hills of Chappaqua , and . Mrs. Wallace had architects design a new headquarters modeled on : colonial Williamsburg , Va . In 1939 the Digest moved into its new house , since expanded . A VAST , editor-dominated organization now strives for the variety , " lasting interest , " and condensation that were the Wallace magic from the start . Roughly 80 per cent of the articles now are original writing , with 40 per cent picked up from other publications . The plan is to get back to about 50-50 . Everything sent to the Digest is supposed to get a reading , including the 600,000 pieces of mail annually containing candidates for the anecdotal departments . On the average , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . a third without hurting it , but many articles can not be cut that much . Articles that are written by Digest staff members on assignment also are expected to go through condensation . Being surrounded by experts , Wallace also puts them to work checking out his philanthropies , which are many and varied . He has a particular fondness for matching grants , which he calls chat . lenge grants. , A close editorial associate said he thinks the Wallaces are trying to give away all their wealth and that " it 's terribly important to him " that it is not frittered away . " Not long ago he sent me a check for 9100,001 made out to a philanthropy , " said the associate . " On the note under it , he was wondering why a particular ' cost had gone up from $4.85 to $5.04 .
