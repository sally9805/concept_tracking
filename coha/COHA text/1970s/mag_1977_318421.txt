ISLANDS IN THE STREAM <P> Directed by FRANKLIN J. SCHAFFNER <P> Screenplay by DENNE BART PETITCLERC <P> Hemingway and Hollywood have never been a very good match . The moviemakers have tended to play up Papa 's most blatant streaks in mawkish romances ( A Farewell to Arms ) , pseudo-profound he-man heroics ( For Whom the Bell Tolls ) and farragoes of exotic drinks , sports and angst ( The Sun Also Rises ) . The Hemingway adaptation with the most spark left in it today is To Have and Have Not , in which Director Howard Hawks tossed out most of the original novel and wrenched the rest into a racy adventure yarn around Bogart and Bacall . <P> Islands in the Stream , based on Hemingway 's posthumous 1970 novel , is more serious . It is an attempt to capture the elusive strains of tenderness and generosity that could inform Hemingway 's writing when he stopped beating his breast . But except for George C. Scott in the leading role , it attempts to do this without anything approaching Hemingway 's gifts , tarnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains an attempt-earnest and labored . After watching it , one is tempted to say : Come back , Howard Hawks . <P> The plot concerns Thomas Hudson ( Scott ) , a famous sculptor , twice divorced , living in the Bahamas in 1940 . Insofar as Hudson 's story is a love story , it refreshingly focuses on his love for his three sons by both marriages ( Hart Bochner , Michael-James Wixted , Brad Savage ) . During a long visit by the boys early in the film , he painfully reaches toward them across gaps of isolation , resentment and pride-his own and sometimes theirs . Later , when the oldest son is shot down while serving as a fighter pilot , Hudson has a bittersweet interlude with the boy 's mother ( affectingly played by Claire Bloom ) and decides to return to the U.S. On the way , he is fatally caught up in the smuggling of Jewish war refugees by small boat into Cuba . <P> <P> Beauty and Mystery . Denne Bart Petitclerc 's script drastically compresses and rearranges Hemingway 's story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shears away reams of embarrassingly arch , blustery episodes and mannered barroom colloquies . Too often , though , what he salvages tends toward the simplistic and the soapy . This tendency is hardly helped by the hopelessly stilted direction of Franklin J. Schaffner ( who directed Scott to somewhat better effect in Patton ) . Here is a movie about freedom , art , love and death , and there is not a breath of poetry in it . Indeed , it is most prosaic when it tries to be poetic , as when Hudson muses that the sea " has great beauty and mystery , and she is eternal , " or when his middle son 's day-long ordeal with a giant marlin that gets away magically triggers a reconciliation with Dad . <P> Scott can do little with moments like these , but he does wonders with many others . His performance searches out the Hemingway man beneath the macho mask-harsh but affectionate , exacting but forgiving , an aging beach comber sifting through the wreckage of his life for those few irreducible fragments of value that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Hemmings , the onetime hip photographer in Blow-Up , who here turns in a pungent character portrayal as a local hanger-on equally devoted to Hudson and to rum .
