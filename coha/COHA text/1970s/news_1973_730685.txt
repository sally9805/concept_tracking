txt President Nixon and critics of his appointment of L. Patrick Gray III as FBI director say they agree on one principle ? that the FBI must be reasonably pure of politics . But suspicions that federal investigators are responding to partisan pressures are higher among Deinocrats than ever . The role of John W. Dean III , counsel to the President , in handling White House liaison with the FBI in the Watergate case has come more into question . ' There is bitter frustration among Democrats because they expect President Nixon will not relent on his refusal to allow Mr. Dean to testify . Mr. Dean will not permit interviews by the press either . The charges of a working alliance between Dwight L. Chapin ? a presidential aide working with H. R. Haldeman , powerful top assistant to Mr. Nixon ? with Donald H. Segretti in political espionage ventures have been reheated . RepUtations at stake Many reputations are at stake as the Senate Judiciary Committee plods through the testimony concerning Mr. Gray . Still another Senate committee hearing is being readied to air the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials have thus far . The appointment of Mr. Gray , an associate of Mr. Nixon in his political career , to head up the FBI is , in many observers ' , minds , the issue with the most far-reaching implications . As the critics of Mr. Gray now loose more accusations against him before the committee , there are these three alternatives : // *No pQlitics for FB4 but // ? The Senate can ultimately refuse to confirm Mr. Gray , and , should more damaging evidence be presented , the White House could conceivably withdraw his nomination . That does not appear likely now . ? Mr. Gray could be confirmed by the Senate with the expectation that he has learned some lessons and that he can demonstrate this in the next few years . ? The Senate will go along with Mr. Gray cynically with the expectation that when Democrats are in control of the . White House , Mr. Gray will be bounced and perhaps a director politically friendly to the occupant of the White House will be appointed . Such open politicizing of the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject in Washington says should not happen . Special nettle in Congress Though the late J. Edgar Hoover was often associated with ultraconservative views , he was reappointed by successive presidents of both parties . The specter of having the FBI 's investigatory resources used in direct behalf of an already strong White House is disturbing in Congress particularly . From time to time , senators cite the fate of countries where police power has fallen into the hands of heeds of other natIons . Mr. Nixon 's only official comment has been his press conference remark on Mr. Gray 's political speech in behalf of the President in Ohio last fall : " As far as Mr. Gray is concerned ? and not the individual , but the director of the FBI ? he must be , as Mr. Hoover was before him , a nonpartisan figure . " He should not be involved in making political statements and that does not mean , if we look at Mr. Hoover 's record , that he will not say some things that will not sound political at times , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supporting a candidate , opposing a candilate , and Mr. Gray , on the basis of what I nave seen , had no intention of doing so , , " If there was anything indicating that luring the campaign that we were trying to enlist him in that , it certainly did n't have my support and would not have it noW . " Ohio link denied The President was dissociating himself from the request of one of his aides for Mr. Gray to go to speak in Ohio , then considered a crucial area in the election . After the President 's comments , Mr. Gray testified on how he worked closely with White House aides in matters concerning the Watergate and Segretti political espionage cases . He gave them all relevant documents . The evidence , as seen through Democratic eyes , is that Mr. Gray was unusually deferential to White House wishes . He defends his actions and says he would repeat them under similar circumstances . He.adtnita not pressing Mr. Dean , counsel to the President , on whether someone in the White House had used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Segretti for appearances before a grand jury on charges of political espionage against the Democrats . The sensitivity to Mr. Gray 's testimony was so high at the White House that Ronald L. Ziegler , the President 's press secretary , volunteered to newsmen the White House hope that the committee " would reconsider this policy considering unevaluated raw data from FBI files . " ACLU warning cited Mr. Ziegler pointed ? apparently at the behest of President Nixon to a similar warning on the subject issued earlier by the American Civil Liberties Union . Mr. Gray has released the FBI files on the Watergate and Segretti cases to the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee . Some of this material tends to support Democratic feeling that : A. There was a more direct link between the White Hoilse and political espionage against the Democrats than the Watergate trial brought out . B. Mr. Gray was at fault in not holding top White House aides accountable in the unauthorized use of confidential FBI findings . He trusted Mr. Dean and the White House operation , Mr , Gray explained , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amiss ,
