Another senseless round of terror and counterterror shook the Middle East last week . It began last Tuesday morning when salvos of 3.5-in. rockets crashed into buildings that housed offices of the Palestine Liberation Organization in downtown Beirut . The main P.L.O . headquarters for Lebanon , on the wide , busy boulevard called the Corniche Mazraa , was wrecked , as was the P.L.O . research center near the Rue Sadat . The office responsible for coordinating al-Fatah 's covert terrorist activities inside Israel narrowly escaped heavy damage when the four rockets that had obviously been aimed at it landed instead on a nearby empty apartment . The rockets , which had been mounted inside boxes fastened to the tops of autos parked near the P.L.O . headquarters , amazingly killed no P.L.O . officials , although five Palestinians were wounded . <P> God 's Wrath . Lebanese police and the P.L.O . immediately blamed Israel , while rumors floated that an Israeli counterterrorist organization called the Wrath of God Squad , purportedly attached to the office of Premier Yitzhak Rabin , was responsible . Although Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation of any military units in the attack , they did not issue a similar denial on behalf of Israel 's civilian intelligence agencies . <P> Whether or not the Israelis were responsible for the attack , the fedayeen quickly acted . The day after the Beirut raid , a young man in a cinema in Tel Aviv tossed homemade hand grenades into the audience . Three people-including the terrorist-were killed and nearly 60 injured . In Beirut , P.L.O . Leader Yasser Arafat declared : " We have retaliated for the Beirut attack . " However , some neutral observers questioned whether the attack was retaliatory . They doubt that the P.L.O . could so quickly organize the operation . Credit for the attack was claimed by George Habash 's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , a group opposed to Arafat 's more moderate policies . <P> Israel in turn wasted no time in retaliating . The next afternoon four Israeli air force Phantoms strafed and bombed three P.L.O . camps on the outskirts of Beirut . One person was killed and ten injured ; six of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yasser Abed Rabbo , a pro-Arafat P.L.O . leader , declared : " We shall teach the enemy that its crimes will not go unpunished . " To back these tough words , the guerrillas rocketed two towns in Israel Thursday night . Although no casualties were reported , Israel retaliated once again and bombarded the Lebanese town of Nabatiyeh . The Israelis also intercepted a band of Fatah guerillas soon after it had infiltrated from Lebanon . Four Arab terrorists and one Israeli policeman were killed in the gun battle .
