RAISE RACE RAYS RAZE : ESSAYS SINCE 1965 by Imamu Amiri Baraka ( LeRoi Jones ) . 169 pages . Random House . $5.95 . <P> For all his bitter denunciations of white civilization as decadent and evil , LeRoi Jones can not quite flush it from his system . It is as much a part of this 36-year-old black writer as having been the son of a Newark , N.J. , postal worker , a graduate of Howard University , an East Village intellectual with a Tyrolean hat and a white wife , and a gifted poet-playwright who was cheered until white liberals decided that white guilt was a form of masochism . <P> An ambivalent past can be a source of strength and creative energy . Today Jones-also known as Imamu Amiri Baraka-has a black wife and is the leader of Spirit House , an African culture center in Newark . But the past can also cause awkward ironies . Why , for example , should Jones , as dedicated as he is to the unique genius of African cultures , be so dependent on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead weight has a consistently bad effect on the otherwise vital and aggressive street style of many of the essays and manifestoes contained in Raise Race , etc . Sometimes he attempts to lighten the load by adding asides- " if you can dig that , " after phrases like " we hate as of a legitimate empirical reaction . " The result is an embarrassing self-consciousness . Yet self-consciousness is what at this stage Jones ' Black Power mission is really all about . " We are self-conscious now , " he writes , " because we are trying to break from slavery . If we could see it continuously as people , as the devil collecting and using our energies to pervert the world , then there would be no pause , no rhetoric , only action , which is divine/ ' <P> " O Allah . " Jones ' rhetoric about virile blacks v. effete whites proves his own point . Like the quotations of Chairman Mao , such talk is a form of political action , though hardly divine . The book does offer a savage vignette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a snarling account of that city 's 1967 riots set against a background of ethnic politics and official corruption . But mainly Jones pushes a distended version of black nationalism based on a fusion of black art , black politics and African spiritualism . <P> What Jones means when he uses the word black is not always evident , though it is clear that he is against anything white in the American or European sense . " O Allah O Shango ( rulers of our ancient cities ) O Osiris , we will be closer to you from now on , ' ' he cries . Elsewhere he declares , " Do not talk Marx or Lenin or Trotsky when you speak of political thinkers . Abdel Rahman , Nkrumah , Sekoti Tour , Mao , Du-Bois , Fanon , Nyerere , Garvey , Lumumba , Malcolm , Guevara , Elijah , Abu Dekr will plot , have already plotted , our way . "
