Though Iowa Governor Robert Ray has been asked all kinds of favors , he recently received a unique request . A state convict named Bobbie Ferguson pleaded to be allowed to remain in prison when his sentence is up in a year : " I am writing you this letter to tell you that I want a life term I have no friends no family and no trade so I do n't want to rob some one or steal I am not that kind so I am writing you for help in my matter to try to stay here for life . Thank you Bobbie " <P> No one would argue that jail is not home for Bobbie . He has spent most of his 39 years behind bars and walls of one kind or another . He was born to a convict mother in a women 's reformatory . Shortly after birth he was placed in a state hospital for 14 years . During this period , he may have enjoyed , or rather suffered , a few months of freedom , and may even have spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 , the record is even hazier ; Bobbie 's story is that he was in one institution or another . What is clear is that ever since 19 he has made sure he stayed in jail . <P> Whenever he has been released in recent years , he has committed some crime-vagrancy , robbery , larceny-in order to get arrested again . Placed in halfway houses , he has invariably escaped . If police did not find him soon enough , he turned himself in . The punishment : jail , of course . <P> In all his escapades he has never hurt anyone . " In some of his periods of frustration , he may have been slightly threatening , " says Lou V. Brewer , warden of the state penitentiary at Fort Madison , where Bobbie is presently incarcerated . " But he 's never followed through on any threat . He 's just a big old affable guy . " <P> Substitute Family . Bobbie likes his fellow cons and he likes to work , mostly as a janitor . " I think he knows us better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe we 're the substitute for things that he lacked in life-ike a family . " <P> Governor Ray is pondering Bobbie 's plight . As his press secretary Dick Gelbert explains : " The Governor has no power to extend sentences ; he can only commute or pardon or parole . " But the publicity aroused by Bobbie 's letter may eventually get him what he wants . MGM has even considered doing a movie or TV show about his life , a project Bobbie thought he would like . <P> The attention given Bobbie may also remind people that he is articulating what many other prisoners feel but can not express . They are terrified of the outside world and its demands , and they commit crimes-sometimes violent ones-to be returned to the security of prison . " Bobbie 's case is extreme , " says Warden Brewer , " but you 'll find his story in every prison in the country . "
