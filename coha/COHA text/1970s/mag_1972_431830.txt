 | Unforgettabel Bugs Baer OFTEN when the news seems especially gloomy , I find myself remembering my friend Bugs Baer . Bugs had a cockeyed For almost 50 years he evoked chuckles from Americans with his nationally syndicated column of oneline jokes . He could say more in one line than anyone else I ever knew . Even today , several years after his death , his wit still fits our vagaries and global follies . Our diplomats meet with the North Vietnamese , and I think of Bugs ' warning : " America never lost a war or won a peace conference . " Our economy slumps , and I recall Bugs ' line : " Things are so tough hitchhikers will go either way . " A big-city scandal erupts , and I think of what Bugs said about New York : " New York is so honest you can leave your garbage out all winter and nobody will take it . " I notice my midriff is expanding and remember : " There is a destiny that ends our shape . " And with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said of those pallid ersatz suds called near beer : " The guy who invented near beer ' was sure a poor judge of distance . " I met Bugs in Washington , D.C. , when he was covering the 1933 World Series for the Hearst organi-  | zation . He was funny just to look at . He had a square face with a nose like a ripe tomato , a squat , muscular body , bowlegs , and an engaging grin which looked , as he once said , as if he could eat a banana sideways . Although he was one of the bestknown newspapermen in the country and I was merely the fledgling sports editor of the Washington Herald , we became friends . Bugs ad a rare gift for friendship . " A friend , " he said , " is a person who can be the star in your sapphire . " A few years later , I moved to New York to cover sports for Hearst 's American . At first , my wife and I found the big city cold and impersonal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which included such notables as Babe Ruth , Robert ( " Believe It or Not " ) Ripley and Walter Winchell . Bugs was living the good life . His column , read by an estimated 15 million daily , brought him a thousand dollars a week . His slim , dark-haired wife , Louise , had been one of Ziegfeld 's most beautiful show girls , and they lived in a posh Park Avenue apartment . When their son , Arthur , Jr. , was born , Bugs sent Louise a wire saying , " I hear you had a boy in your room last night . " Bugs could work anywhere and under almost any conditions . A crowded city room , with its bedlam of clacking typewriters and jangling phones , was music to his muse . His desk invariably looked as if someone had emptied a wastebasket on it . Although he was a natural wit , he sweated over his daily quota of lines such as : " Not all women can wear slacks , but they all do . " Or : " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching a decision by changing the subject . " But his verbal wit could be quick and caustic . Once he called on a friend , only to have the friend 's dog rush out and bite him . " I did n't mind the mutt taking a chunk out of my leg , " he told his friend John Wheeler , " but the so-and-so spat it out ! " An extremely generous man himself , he had a low opinion of those who were n't . Of an artful dodger of restaurant checks , he said , " That man has an impediment in his reach . " Once , when a friend told him that an unpopular man had committed suicide , Bugs said , " Well , he shot the right guy . " And Spell , Too . He was born Arthur Baer in Philadelphia , the seventh of 14 children of poor immigrant parents from Alsace-Lorraine . At 14 he was packed off to work as a lace designer . He made $I2 a week drawing scrolls and flowers . But the work palled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job as a copyboy on the Philadelphia Ledger , with hopes of becoming a cartoonist . He soon moved on to Washington , where he became a sports cartoonist for the Washington Times . He signed his cartoons with a whimsical little bug in the corner , and thus became " Bugs " Baer . Bugs turned to writing when he  | and a sportswriter were assigned to cover the spring training of the Washington Senators baseball team . Bugs was to do a daily cartoon . The writer , however , went on a monumental bender , and disappeared for a week . Bugs not only drew his own cartoon but wrote the absent writer 's stories for him . Back in Washington , it quickly became apparent that Baer had written the funny training-camp stories . About that time , George Kaufman , later to gain fame as a playwright , quit his job on the Times in a wrangle with the managing editor . " You can have Kaufman 's job , " the managing editor told Bugs . " You 're the only cartoonist who can spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was a plea for party honesty ? but cooler heads prevailed . " And : " There is n't a clerk in Washington who can operate a subtracting machine . " Woodrow Wilson was then President , and the Vice President was little-known Thomas Marshall . One day , reporters asked Marshall what he thought of the state of the nation . Marshall remembered a line he had spotted in the paper . " What America needs is a good five-cent cigar , " he declared . Today Marshall is remembered chiefly for that line ? which he purloined from Bugs . Bugs ' quips so amused the editor of the New York World that he hired Bugs to come to Manhattan and write a column . It was a quick success . Bugs liked to reminisce later about his early days in New York . He ate at a restaurant frequented by newspapermen . " They developed terrific wrist muscles trying to pull down a clean spot on the roller towel , " he recalled . Of his hotel accommodations , he said , " Towels and soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted by World War I. He enlisted in 1918 , and was assigned to Camp Zachary Taylor near Louisville , Ky . He did n't think much of Army routine . " An ' Army goldbricker will discover 11 ways of not doing a thing that can only be done two ways , " he noted . The war ended when he was about to be sent overseas . " I framed my discharge , " he said , " so my grandchildren ca n't read the back where it says : Battles ? none ; wounds ? none ; bravery ? optional . ' " Compleat Comic . On being mustered out of the service , Bugs was hired by the Hearst organization and worked there the rest of his life . He covered everything : conventions , sports , theater . After one opening night , he wrote : " The play had a happy ending . Everybody was glad it was over . " When he covered the famous Scopes " monkey trial " in Tennessee , where Clarence Darrow opposed William Jennings Bryan on the issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of War , on the premise that anything he was in charge of never lasted very long . Countless vaudeville comics used Bugs ' lines in their acts , some paying him , others simply appropriating them . Once one of the Baer  | jokes backfired . A comic had asked Bugs to give him a sure-fire squelch for hecklers . Bugs gave him one . A few nights later , a tipsy lady at ringside began heckling the comic , who flung out Baer 's squelch : " What would you charge to haunt a house ? " The laugh he got was drowned out when the lady looked up blowzily and asked , " How many rooms ? " Finally , Bugs began performing his humor in vaudeville instead of writing it for others . Many of his jokes had a timelessness and universality that make them still relevant today . " No administration has shown a profit since we stopped stealing from the Indians , " he said . And : " Alimony is single blessedness with double indemnity . " Head Down . Vaudeville eventually perished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after-dinner speaker . " The greatest after-dinner speech ever made , " he asserted , " was Give me the check . ' " At one luncheon , he introduced tenor Jan Peerce . " A tenor , " he explained , " is a fellow who gets stabbed in the third act of an opera and , instead of bleeding , sings . " Although he was almost always funny , Bugs knew when not to be . On one occasion , his guest was Babe Ruth , then dying of cancer . The Babe was gaunt , his voice a hoarse croak . Bugs merely brought him to the dais to take a bow . Ruth got a tremendous hand . Bugs then looked down at the Duke of Windsor in the audience and said proudly , " We have royalty in this country , too . You have just seen the Sultan of Swat . " Another time , Bugs announced : " The following guests today have one thing in common . " He then read off the names of 25 men , none of which registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common , " Bugs revealed , " is that each has won the Congressional Medal of Honor . " The medal winners got one of the biggest ovations I 've ever heard . As a young man , Bugs had been a left-handed shortstop , wrestled and played handball , but when I knew him he played golf . He seemed to have the game confused with distance running . He would almost trot around the course . When he stroked a putt , he would run ahead of the ball , trying to coax it into the hole . He began taking lessons from a pro , who insisted that Bugs keep his head down , even after completing his swing . One day Bugs hit a drive and kept his head down . When he finally looked up , his ball was nestled right by the pin . He had almost made a hole in one ! " I give up , " he fumed . " For the first time in my life I hit a good shot , and I did n't even get to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had more than his share of sadness . His first wife , Marjorie , died of influenza . His second wife , the beautiful and beloved Louise , suffered a series of heart attacks and lived thereafter in the shadow of death . When she finally died , Bugs was inconsolable . He  | moved to Connecticut and became something of a recluse ; yet he continued to spread cheer through his column . Moderation in Excess . When Bugs was in his 70 'S , his health began failing , too . He underwent a major operation . " I 've got so many tubes in me I do n't need a doctor , " he said . " I need a switchboard operator . " On turning 78 , he received congratulations from many friends . " My longevity , " he wrote to me , " is due to moderation in excess . " He was still writing three columns a week when he turned 80 . However , when I visited him at his place in Connecticut , he was having trouble with his eyesight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at arm 's length , then closer to his eyes , then at arm 's length again . " At my age , " he sighed , " I read as if I 'm playing the trombone . Oh , to be 70 again , with the wind and the rain in my hair . " He rarely complained about his illness , playing it for laughs , as he did the problems of the world . An exception was a Christmas column , in which he wrote : " What kind of Christmas story do you write when you 're not sure how much string is left in your ball of twine ? " Then he answered his own question : " You write of hope , goodwill , faith and peace on earth . " He died in 1969 at the age of 83 , taking a lot of merriment with him . The Promise of Prison Reform In a commencement address at Ripon College in May 1967 , federal judge Warren E. Burger , now Chief Justice of the United States , declared : " We afford the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials , retrials and reviews of any society in the world . Yet , once a man is found guilty and sent to prison , he is almost literally thrown into the scrap heap . All the considerations society showed him before he went to prison are suddenly dropped .
