txt Letters pg . 14 Letters Heroin Decriminalization : How It Could Work To the Editor : Addictions Services Commissioner Jerome Hornblass 's support for heroin decriminalization may help the judiciary and his own fund-starved agency , but it will not reduce heroin abuse . Rather , decriminalization will encourage and sustain the illicit heroin market and the profits that attract those who ply this nefarious trade . Decriminalization would also encourage drug-related crime , now conservatively estimated by Federal sources to be at a level of $10 billion annually , and growing . Curiously , the same judicial respondents who promote decriminalization also propose fines for possession , thus exacerbating the money needs of the trafficking victim . Decriminalization will not reduce the involvement of youths as petty heroin traffickers . Rather , the immunity of youths from criminal prosecution is a matter of widespread penalcode reform , an initiative which the New York State Legislature has recently taken . Perhaps the greatest of all ironies implicit in the report was the rejection Elizabeth Van Itallie of heroin maintenance while decriminalizing the entire heroin trafficking street scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand link with illicit supply sources could be broken . The creation of heroin dispensing and drug control dispensaries could constitute a genuinely positive step in that direction for several unique reasons . First of all , addicts would be in controlled environments . For the first time , some reatoond reliable form of measure as to the size of the addict population could be attained . At the present time , reliance is largely on hospital emergency room admissions for drug overdose and hepatitis cases as bases for determining the size of addict populations . Secondly , violators , such as illicit drug dealers and illicit purchasers , could be subject to mandatory sentencing , a move which would minimize the administrative aspects of statutory reform while maintaining still another form of deterrent . Thirdly , illicit dealers , now faced with Federal , state or local dispensing agencies , would either have to lower prices or increase product potency , two profit  --  deflating moves . Finally , more public support for . aggressive drug abuse prevention measures may accrue to the criminal justice system once information collected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . R. S. LOCKWOODAsst . Professor of Political Science U.S. Military Academy West Point , N. Y. , Jan. 2 , 1977 Of Con Ed Rates and Frustrated Manufacturers To the Editor : Mayor Beame has correctly listed energy costs as a factor in job losses in New York City . The effect of Con Ed 's rate structure has long been overlooked . The demand component of a local manufacturer 's electric bill causes his actual energy rate to rise from a base of 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour to 11.6 cents per kilowatt-hour . By comparison , the average residential customer pays approximately 9.9 cents per kilowatt-hour ! Yet , Con Ed is asking for an increase in the demand charge for high energy users to $10.15 per kilowatt from $8.95 per kilowatt , with an increase in the summer surcharge to $1.2 per kilowatt from $0.6 per kilowatt . Demand charges are imposed to cover construction costs for the generating capacity needed to supply peak loads . These costs are not dependent To the Editor : It seems quite clear from the closeness of the election returns that President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Presidential pardon of former President Nixon . Both candidates were asked by reporters during the campaign about clemency for the remaining victims of the political vendetta instigated by the Democratic Congress , a pardon for the prisoners of Watergate . Both President Ford and candidate Carter were uncomfortably vague . However , it seems to me that a new era of good feeling could be inaugurated if the Democratic Congress should pass a resolution calling upon President-elect Carter and President Ford to prepare a pardon for all the prisoners of Watergate , all of whom believed they were acting in the best interests of America , a pardon for Mitchell , Haldeman , Erlichman , Dean , Hunt , Barker , Colson and all the rest . Perhaps then some of us diehard Republicans could judge with an open mind the efforts of President-elect Carter and the Democratic Congress . PAUL K. STEWART Portland , Me. , Dec. 20 , 1976 upon fuel charges . Air-conditioners are the prime cause of high peak loads . Local manufacturers , with steady loads the year round , are being assessed for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billing complaints , especially in the demand area , the threats of shutoffs , demand for deposits and late payment penalties , the frustration of manufacturers is obvious . They can go out of business , move or build their own generating facilities . Con Ed rates have been set to guarantee it a constant return as shown by the new transfer adjustment . Until an equitable energy rate is set in New York City , the loss of manufacturing jobs will continue unabated . ABRAHAM ABRAMOWITZ Prof. Emeritus of Electrical Engineering The City College Bronx , Dec. 24 , 1976 To the Editor : Changes in our immigration law and procedures effective January 1977 will make it extremely difficult , if not impossible , for physicians to immigrate into the United States . For the past several years , physicians have immigrated freely and many hospitals have come to rely upon aliens to fill staff positions . It appears that the Department of Labor and the Immigration and Naturalization Service have concluded that there no longer is a shortage of physicians in the United States . The fact that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of space in medical schools here indicates that our growing need for medical services will not be adequately met by United States medical school graduates . The prevention of the immigration of physicians will only serve to inflate the cost of medical care . The Department of Labor and the Immigration and Naturalization Service should be made to justify these new restrictions publicly . CHARLES ARONOWITZ New York , Dec. 28 , 1976 If Panama Were Asked To Be the 51st State To the Editor : In its report this week , the Commission on United States-Latin American Relations rightly points to " the smoldering dispute with Panama , " over the Panama Canal , as President-elect Carter 's " most urgent " hemispheric issue , for 1977 . It may also be his greatest opportunity for statesmanship . But not on a chauvinistic level . The 1.5 million Panamanian people have a strong legal basis for their claims to the Canal . They also have a sense of having experienced racial , , economic and national discrimination throughout the history of the waterway . More saber-rattling will get us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their caudillo to ridicule . Furthermore , an imposed settlement will further antagonize the many sections of the Latin American public that already dislike us . At a conference on sovereignty in Mexico last month , an idea came to me that I should like to offer for what it is worth : The Congress should invite Panama to become the fifty-first state of the Union . I think that the Panamanians will accept the invitation and apply . Then both the Panamanians and the Canal will become fully American . Panamanians will share equal rights with all American citizens , including the guarantee of a republican form of government in their first state elections . Our friends in the world will be heartened , and our enemies will be confused and divided . ( Prof. ) ALFRED DE GRAM Dept. of Politics , N.Y.U. New York , Dec. 29 , 1976 Oceangoing ' Wrecks ' To the Editor : Oil tankers ' casualty records , including oil spillage , should be given to charterers and to the authorities , making it economically untenable to keep pushing these old wrecks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARTHUR MCKENZIE Director , Tanker Advisory Center New York , Jan. 3 , 1977 For a Watergate Pardon Needed Alien Doctors Swine Flu : In Defense of the Administration 's Decision to Vaccinate To the Editor : " The Swine Flu Fiasco " by Harry Schwartz ( column Dec. 21 ) is a onesided interpretation of actual events . Those responsible in early 1976 for the scientific decision to recommend nationwide influenza vaccination were faced with the following facts : ? In a human-to-human epidemic at Fort Dix , N.J. , a new strain of influenza A virus , with a major shift in both antigenic components , was isolated . Every previous such event was followed by a worldwide inflenza epidemic by the following winter . ? The new strain produced antibodies in man similar to those found in the survivors of the 1917-18 epidemic that took millions of lives . ? The spread of influenza is so rapid that before the next epidemic season vaccination must be as complete as possible . The alternative  --  doing nothing except plan for the future  --  would have left the country totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no part in the scientific decision to recommend the vaccination program . But without the benefit of Mr. Schwartz 's hindsight , faced with the situation at that time , we would have been forced to the same conclusion . One can imagine the screams from the hindsighters if nothing had been done and an epidemic had broken out this autumn . As must be expected in any medical program involving millions of people , unpleasant events in direct time sequence with the vaccinating of an individual are immediately blamed on the procedure . The sudden cardiac deaths in Pittsburgh proved to be isolated events not due to the vaccine per se , although they raise serious questions about the environment in which vaccination is performed . Now an appraisal is being made of the possible relationship of the Gulllain-Band syndrome and influenza vaccination . The syndrome has never been associated with any vaccine program and could not have been anticipated . Moreover , trials of the vaccine on thousands of individuals without serious reactions were carried out in the summer of 1976 . The public must face the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccination , a surgical operation , or the administration of a single aspirin or salt tablet . Every preventive or therapeutic measure is a trade-off between potential benefits and side effects . Moreover , when the individual takes the chance to obtain a potential medical benefit after he has been properly informed of the benefits and the risks he automatically shares responsibility with all *lose who provide and administer the agent . Finally , we will not debate the establishment of vaccine programs in preventive medicine with Mr. Schwartz . The conquests of smallpox , diphtheria , poliomyelitis and measles , to name a few , speak for themselves . THOMAS C. CHALMERS , M.D. Dean , Mt . Sinai School of Medicine New York City ROBERT H.
