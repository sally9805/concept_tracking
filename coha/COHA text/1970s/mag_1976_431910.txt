 | World 's Biggest Windmill @# NASA PLUM BROOK STATION SANDUSKY , OHIO the biggest windmill prototype in the world stands an open field near here . It 's the Energy Rerch and Development Administration 's ( ERDA ) Model Zero 100-kw wind generator , first reported on in its design stage in PS , July ' 74 . Now it 's ality . I was visiting the site to check on the status this giant wind generator , one of the testbeds the U.S. wind-power program . The rig 's tapering tower , spidering its way up from the flat field , looked sturdy enough , much like high-tension towers all over the country . But as I climbed the open metal stairway leading 100 feet up to the streamlined generator capsule , I could feel the tremor as the steel structure wiggled ever so slightly in the wind . It was the kind of twitch you feel at the top of seemingly solid skyscrapers . That occasional little vibration makes you respect wind power . By the time I got to the top the wind had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom to about 25 mph , and it had a chilly bite . But I soon forgot this in honest awe of the giant propeller . The monster prop , which cost $320,000 , stretched a twisting 125 feet across its two fabricated aluminum-covered blades . The blades were feathered to the wind , locked tight from revolving in addition  | by a hefty disk brake inside the capsule . A step at a time , I hauled myself up into the fiberglass-covered capsule . Once inside the gear- and shaft-filled container , I found the wind was suddenly gone . But I could see the giant blades flex in the wind gusts even though they were feathered . When the blades rotate they make a soft but powerful swish as the wind pushes them around . The tower sways as the blades move from the high winds aloft to the low winds down closer to the ground . But even with the blades immobilized , I could feel the tower react every time a blade bent slightly to a wind puff . Some features Here are some of this unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is designed to start generating power in an eightmph wind . It reaches its maximum 100-kw output in an 18-mph wind . Maximum blade rotation speed is 40 rpm . This can be maintained in different wind speeds by changing the pitch angle of the propeller much as is done in prop planes . As wind speed builds to more than 18 mph , the blades will spill excess power by approaching the feathered position . At wind speeds of less than eight mph and more than 60 mph the blades will be placed in the full feathered position and will no longer revolve . ? Unlike most windmills I 've seen , where the rotor blades face the wind in front of the tower and are kept pointing into the wind with a big tail fin , these blades are located downwind of the tower . There is no tail fin . Ron Thomas , who heads the Wind Research Project at NASA 's Lewis Research Center in Cleveland , told me this keeps the wind from blowing the flexible blades into the tower . The tower , upwind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blades . But as each blade comes down it is affected by the " wind shadow " of the tower . ? Instead of a tail fin there is a powered yaw control to keep the blades and the fiberglass pod headed into the wind . The yaw control is designed to follow slow changes in general wind direction rather than sudden minor shifts in wind . Sudden shifts could overstress the shaft because of the precessional effects of the turning blade that acts like a giant gyroscope resisting change . Yaw rate is only 1/6 rpm and operates even when the machine is not generating power . This could take care of a situation where the wind had stopped from one direction and started up again from a completely different angle . ? The blades are connected to a hub bolted rigidly to the main low-speed shaft . The hub houses the gears and linkages for changing pitch of the blades . Wind loads , both steady and gusting , and centrifugal loads are absorbed by the hub . The fixed hub has admitted disadvantages as well as advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disadvantage is increased blade root forces that result from abrupt wind shifts or shears and wind shadow from the tower itself . ? The pitch-change mechanism is the same hydraulic-pump type used in some early aircraft propellers . A rack-and-pinion torque actuator turns a master gear which , in turn , rotates the blades through a bevel gear on the blade roots . This system has the advantage of being self-contained and protected from the elements . Hydraulic fluid enters the shaft through rotating seals from a hydraulic pump mounted separately on the structure . ? The hub and low-speed shaft transmit high torque to the alternator through a 45:1 gearbox . From the gearbox the high-speed shaft drives the alternator at high rpm , through a belt system . ? The gearbox is a triple-reduction type set up to give a stepup ratio instead of a conventional step-down one . Gearbox is oversize , has a rated output of 176 kw ( 236 hp ) , about one-third higher than the maximum power of 133 kw ( 178 hp ) the rotor should ever supply . ? The alternator is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushless exciter and regulator . The regulator includes power , potential , and current transformers . The 1425-pound alternator is a three-phase 60 Hz , Y-connected machine rated at 125 kva , 0.8 power factor , 480 volts . ? The 100-foot tower is a steel pinned-truss design on a concrete foundation . It 's not very good looking , but it is relatively low cost since it 's the type already used by utility companies . The natural vibration frequency of this kind of tower is higher than that of a guyed tubular type ? an advantage , as we 'll see later . It is designed to withstand not only high winds but also big rotor thrust loads , both @# @# shows author lightweight two-piece rib that 's the same size as one in center section of rotor . Blades are made of alum : - hum ; each weighs 2000 pounds . steady and cyclic . The design also makes it easily accessible for maintenance . Two huge blades The rig 's propeller is not just an ordinary one scaled up . Each carefully curved blade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 pounds . The pitch angle of both blades is controlled at the hub and the blade itself has a progressive twist of 26.5 ? ( see drawing ) . Thus the thicker , slower-moving hub has a greater angle of attack than the thin tapered tip that cuts through the air at a much higher speed ? 178.5 mph , to be precise . The rotor is the biggest singlecost item of this $985,000 windenergy research project . The wind may be free , but obviously , getting power from it is not . Why has ERDA elected to take  | the large-scale approach to wind power ? Why not go the small , on-ite wind-generator route of supplying residential electric power , as many wind-power advocates propose ? I threw these questions to Ron Thomas of NASA and others involved in the project . Thomas told me his own typical midwestern home uses about 600 kwh of electricity each month . If the average house in the Cleveland area were to have its own full-time venerator it would take a machine like this : ? It would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and be mounted on a 50-foot lower . ? Batteries would be required to - tore reserve power for windless periods when the generator was not delivering . These could not be simply a bunch of automobile batteries , because those are designed @# to provide big bursts of energy as opposed to delivering it over long periods of time . A forest of such generators in a housing development is neither practical nor desirable from an aesthetic or from a safety viewpoint . Big generators feeding power into an existing power grid is the design approach taken by ERDA and NASA 's Lewis Research Center . This saves money needed to distribute the new energy and also means it can be plugged in or out as needed and as it is available . Hows and whys In Washington I had a long skull session with Louis Divone , chief of ERDA 's Wind Energy Conversion Branch . I grilled him about the basic hows and whys of the Sandusky design . Why not put a bunch of rotors on each high tower ? " For land-based systems it was determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two 150-foot rotors on the same tower . The reason is that power from the wind goes up with the square of the rotor diameter . By doubling the diameter of a rotor we get four times the power . Thus it would take four 100-foot rotors to equal the power of one 200-foot one . " The cost ? " Depending on exact size it would probably cost 50 to 100 percent more for four rotors and the tower than for one big one . " Why not use more than two blades on a single rotor ? " More blades will give more torque at low speeds . This concept is used for water pumping . Fewer blades provide more energy @#  | for their cost . In small wind machines with blades 20 to 40 feet in diameter three blades are probably best in terms of cost and balance . In larger wind turbines two blades are better . " If the turbine blades are the expensive items and we think of producing them by the hundreds or thousands in a standardized way , how can they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are one answer . Another possibility is to use the same size blades , which would be cheaper to make in production , and have different generators or gearboxes for use in different sites . " ERDA is also looking at variable-speed drives for small rotors . Also , some generators can , within limits , produce constant-voltage power and constant frequency regardless of shaft speed " Revolutionary on-site energy source for your home , " PS , Oct. ' 74 . The within limits ' would be a factor of three or four . " Why do we need constant speed on the rotors ? " There are problems of structural dynamics between the tower and the revolving blades . You want to keep the frequencies set up by the blades different from those of the tower . The big prop blades act like low-frequency tuning forks . If they set up a vibration frequency that is the same as the tower or even parts of it , the unit could tear itself apart with vibration . " How about the effects of ice on the blades ? " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any deicing devices such as are used on airplane props . The big blades are flexible , and we think this will crack off any ice as it forms before it becomes heavy enough to unbalance them . If ice forms on the blades while they are parked we will have to work something out ? perhaps glycol spray . " In the future Tests with the first 100-kw generator will go on for the next two or three years . But it 's only one of several types of wind generators being investigated by ERDA . Two new wind generators using the same size blades as the Plum Brook unit are under construction . By using bigger gearboxes and generators , these rigs will develop @#  | 200 kw . The site locations are to be selected this spring . The next step up is to develop a much more powerful machine . Ron Thomas told me : " We 're starting procurement of a 1 1/2-megawatt machine . It will look much the same as the 100-kw machine but will have a 180 foot to 200-foot rotor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in several directions . They are trying new composite materials for hubs to reduce weight , cost , and improve reliability of rotors ; developing a new teetered hub for the rotor to replace the fixed hub , which should reduce the bending moments of the blade roots and make them less likely to break . At what price ? Cost for the next group of wind venerators is expected to drop significantly . For example , the cost of the first 100-kw machine is projected at $5000 per kilowatt . Cost f similar follow-on machines is expected to be $2000 per kilowatt . By the time industry-produced and operated wind rigs go into operation , cost is expected to go down to $1000 to $600 per kilowatt . This would make the windmills competitive with diesel generators using fuel that costs 30 cents a Callon . The estimates of wind energy available on an annual basis are rather firm and predictable . This can not be said about future world oil supplies . Add to this one major advantage of wind energy : It is non-polluting .
