txt A major new Federal study finds that despite rent control and rent-stablization programs covering New York City apartments , rents generally have risen here more than three times as fast as tenant incomes over the last five years . In 1970 , according to the Census Bureau , the median rent here was $109 a month . This means that half of all rental households in the city were paying more than that amount and half were paying less . By 1975 , a new bureau study made for the city found , the median had risen to nearly $171 a month , a 57 percent increase . During the same period , the median income reported by families in the city 's two million rental apartments rose only 17 percent , from $7,165 a year to $8,935. 25% of Income for Rent The result , the study indicates , is that half the city 's tenants today are paying more than 25 percent of income for rent , including more than 400 , - 000 households that are paying more than 35 percent of income . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent is a proportion that should be the maximum for the great najority of nonwealthy famiies Despite the general upward rend , the study also found that quarter of a million . households here were still paying less than 15 percent of income for rent . Still another key suggestion from the study is that owners of more than 100,000 apartments here have avoided the rent laws aithogether ? either by design or out of ignorance of the complex and often-confusing rules . Consequently , - they have failed to register their apartments as required tinder the rent-stablization program . , Such a failure , which deprives tenants of the program 's rent-limiting protection , has caused dismay among city officials , who say they have been median rent in controlled apartments is now $133 a month , unable to attack the problem because of an inadequate staff . The debate was emphasized in recent days as the new findings were discussed in interviews with landlord and tenant spokesmen . " If we zero in solely on the fact that rents in recent years went up faster than income , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rents were distortedly low in controlled apart-I ments , " said Robert S. Fougner , a lawyer who for years has represented leading landlord groups in many of the court cases involving rent control " Sooner or later it had to happen  --  for darn near 30 years , the low rents were subsidizing I the TV sets and everything else . " Mr. Fougner and other realestate figures agreed that a growing number of tenants could not afford the rents required if their buildings were to meet the costs needed to provide maintenance and services these days , while also meeting such other expenses as real-estate taxes and financing charges . These , too , are spiraling . Batle Lines Forming The Census Bureau study , which is expected to be a major factor in the battles now shaping up over the rent issue in the State Legislature and the , City Council , is still in the ' form of raw data that a consultant is compiling into a report for the city . But The New York Times has obtained some of the key figures covered*by , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when other surveys have found that the costs of maintaining and operating housing here have also soared , thus requiring a sharp increase in rental income for many buildings , according to both real-estate men and a number of housing specialists . Dr. George Sternlieb of Rutgers University , who has closely studied New York 's housing problems , says that the findings in the new Census Bureau survey are " catastrophic . " " The problem is not so much that rents have gone up , " he said , " but that incomes have fallen behind , given the realities of the cost of living here and housing operating costs . The city is increasingly one of poor people , and this is a basic reality behind the fiscal crisis . " Barbara Cohn , the city 's assistant rent commissioner for programs and policy , who has been analyzing the census data , expressed deep concern over what she said were its implications for the city 's housing stock . " Even though we have rent regulations in the city , most tenants are paying as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , " she said . " Concurrently , however , the costs of operating buildings are still rising . So where is the money to come from : to operate them , let alone improve them ? It is truly a dilemma . " ' New Dimensions ' cited Expressing similar concern , the Rent Commissioner , Daniel W. Joy , said that the census findings " add new dimensions " to the issues involving rent regulation here and the debate that has long been swirling over them . But many tenants , still can afford higher rents and should not be given rent-control protection , the realty people and their supporters insisted , citing data in the census survey that backs their view . For example , the study shows that although half of the tenants in the city 's 640,000 rentcontrolled apartments are currently paying more than a quarter of their incomes for rent ? because of annual increases permitted in many controlled units in recent years ? numerous other controlled tenants are paying relatively . little of their incomes for housing . Breakdown Given Specifically , 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of income for rent , and 16 percent are paying 10 to 14 percent of income , the study indicates . The compared with $97 a month in 1970 . All the rent figures cited in this article refer to " gross rents , " that is , rent plus average monthly gas and electricity costs . Dr. Sternlieb has noted that gross rents permit the most " reasonable comparisons " to be made because they eliminate variations that would otherwise result from the fact that utilities are included in the rent in some buildings but not in others . The median " contract rent "  --  the figure that does not include separate utility payments ? also has risen sharply in apartments as a whole in the city since 1970 . This ncrease was from $95 a month ' to $154 , or 62 percent , 5 percentage points higher than the rise in the median gross rent . Louis Winnick , director of urban and metropolitan development at the Ford Foundation , held that despite the " startling " overall rent-rise trends , there was still a sizable. if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A proponent of the view that rent control has generally depressed rental income , and has thus fostered housing decay as well as a reduction of property taxes paid to the fiscally troubled city , he called for a phasing out of the control program over several years . Tenants who prove they can not pay increases needed by their owners should be exempt or should receive Government rent subsidies , he said . A sharply clashing view was offered by Michael , chairman of the New York State Tenants Coalition . The over-all trends pictured by the ' census survey are the latest evidence that " obviously rent control has to be strengthened , expanded and made simpler , " he said . Vacancy Rate 2.8 Percent Tenant spokesmen cite such data in the survey as the finding that the rental vacancy rate here now is 2.8 percent ? a figure previously publicized  --  and the finding that the median income reported by rent-controlled households in 1974 was only $7,057 , up 11 percent from the $6,356 reported in 1969 . They also cite figures indicating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially hurt by the rent-rise trends . For instance , half of the city . Puerto Rican tenants are paying more than 30 percent of their income for rent , the study indicates , while half the elderly households headed by men are paying more than 30 percent of income and half the elderly households headed by women are paying more than 40 percent of income . Mr. agreed that the costs of running and maintaining housing had risen , but Insisted that rent programs had to be reformed so that owners received rent rises only when they " demonstrated a need for increase . " This should be after their actual profits , and not merely cost increases , were housing specialists , the local taken into account , he said . The census survey was undertaken for the cit yas part of a requirement in the state and local rent laws that the vacancy rate be assessed every three years . The rent and income data are considered by specialists to be an invaluable byproduct , although some express skepticism of Census Bureau income data generally . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials consider highly reliable . The local rent-control program , covering 640,000 apartments , is an extension of the World War II Federal rent controls . In 1970 , after criticism of its previous restrictions by landlords and a number of be registered by their owners under the stabilization system . The census survey projects that 417,000 apartments were subject to this program-transfer requirement when the survey was taken early last year . But officials report that now , nearly a year later , only 300,000 apartments subject to the provision have been registered  --  under stabilization . Realty men term the 417,000 fgiure an " exaggeration " of the number of units supposed tobe switched to stabilization , , and hold that what noncompliance there is reflects the inability pf small-scale owners to understand the complex requirements . Tenant spokesmen cite the noncompliance as largely a flouting of the rent laws by many owners . program was changed to permit annual rent rises of up to 7.5 percent in many apartments under a so-called maximumbase-rent formula . Many Categories A separate rent-stabilization program covers nearly 700,000 other apartments . Enacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent-rise limits that vary , with circumstances and with confusing subcategories of stabilized apartments . A 12.5 percent maximum increase for a threeyear renewal lease applies to many stabilized units .
