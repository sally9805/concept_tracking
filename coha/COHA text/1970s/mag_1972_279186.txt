In the wake of Communist gains in the Easter offensive , South Viet Nam 's National Assembly last June reluctantly granted President Nguyen Van Thieu the power to rule by decree for six months . Thieu lost no time in issuing a series of tough decrees that , among other things , increased the income tax rate , set the death penalty for certain crimes , including kidnaping and heroin dealing , subjected some religious groups to the draft , and ordered Saigon 's 40 newspapers to deposit 20 million piasters ( $46 , - 512 ) each as security against government fines or libel suits . <P> The eleventh and latest decree , quietly issued in August over the largely ceremonial signature of Premier Tran Thien Khiem , came to light last week . It is potentially the most important yet and , in the opinion of many critics , destroys any semblance of grass-roots democracy left in South Viet Nam . <P> What Thieu has done is abolish elections in Viet Nam 's 10,626 hamlets . Henceforth province chiefs , all of whom are appointed by Saigon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also appoint-without the approval of elected village councils , which has heretofore been required - the staff and administrative officers in every hamlet and village in the country . The effect of the decree is to extend Thieu 's control right down to the level where most Vietnamese make their most immediate-and sometimes their only-contact with government . <P> Saigon explains the abolition of hamlet elections as a means of tightening administration and providing more effective services . But , as usual in Viet Nam , the real explanation is more complex . Since the Easter offensive began , a number of hamlet chiefs have made accommodations with the Communists . The new decree will permit Thieu to appoint more loyal replacements . More important , this decree , along with the others , will strengthen his hand for the rough-and-tumble politicking that undoubtedly would follow a cease-fire ( the North Vietnamese have repeatedly insisted that any cease-fire agreement must include Thieu 's removal ) . Indeed , Thieu has secretly appointed a commission to prepare bargaining positions for his government in ceasefire negotiations . <P> The U.S. Government , which claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nevertheless tried to put a good face on the situation . In Washington , State Department Spokesman Charles W. Bray conceded the need for stability " at the extreme local level " during the offensive . Other Americans were less sanguine , pointing out that democracy in South Viet Nam has usually been mere window dressing for the benefit of Westerners . All Thieu has done now , said one Foreign Service officer at the U.S. embassy in Saigon , is to " take the glove off the iron fist . "
