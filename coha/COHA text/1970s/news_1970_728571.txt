txt missing column F.C.C. Telephone Study Finds City 's Service Worst in Nation // five days after oraer . Two years earlier , by contrast , the chances were three to one in favor of beating the five-day deadline in New York . And-even now , the Bell System phone companies in such cities as Omaha and San Francisco manage to install about 95 per cent of their new orders on time . The F.C.C. 's discouraging picture of phone service in the nation 's largest city is hardly news to phone users there , to New York 's State Public Service Commission or to the New York Telephone Company , which last summer announced emergency measures to upgrade the vast city system . Yet the commission 's data , part of a continuing study , give fresh statistical proof of mounting deterioration . And they may vet prompt the first Federal enforcement of quality standards , , which have traditionally been ' , left to state regulators and the Bell System itself . William G. Sharwell , vice president for operations of the New York Telephone Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment to the public and to the Public Service Commission that , by the end of this year , with a billion-dollar construction program , we will get service back to normal . " Mr. Sharwell pointed out that he had stated publicly earlier this year that the first quarter , ending in March , would find the company in its busiest season and reaching a low point in service , from which it would begin to emerge this spring . " The first three months were one of the busiest seasons we 've ever had , " he said . " We are now on the upswing " to improved service . The New York City system scores the lowest marks in the country in almost all the categories that the Bell System has established for measuring service . As of January , 1970 , the last month for which the F.C.C. had figures , the rate of service complaints in New York had for the first time exceeded R per cent of the subscribers each month , which meant that the average New Yorker with a phone would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figures indicate , the speed of repair service is slowing down . Two and a half years ago , less than 8 per cent of those who complained about service had to call a second time to get satisfaction in January . 1970 , more than 13 per cent of the service calls got results only after a second complaint . All-Time Lows In three other measures of how well the system works ? the time it takes to get an operator , the time it takes to get a dial tone and the percentage of blocked calls  --  the New York system appeared to be the worst in the country and also reached its own alltime lows last January . When people dial " operator " in New York , the chances are one in five  --  compared with one in 10 two years ago  --  that they will wait more than 10 seconds for a response . Even with the assistance of an operator on person-to-person or collect calls , New Yorkers confront a busy circuit or a recorded message that " Your call did not go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more than twice the national rate and triple the New York rate of two years ago . The only general category in which New York fared relatively well involved direct distance dialing , in which long-distance calls are placed automatically without operator assistance . In the so-called " DDD " category , about 3 ' , per cent of New York 's outgoing calls and about 214 per cent of the incoming calls hit blockages or went astray . Those figures are 50 per cent higher than the DDD failure rate of two years earlier . However , the performance of direct distance dialing in New York is now roughly the same as in other big cities around the country . Deterioration of service within the Bell System , a source of profound embarrassment to the nation 's dominant telephone carrier , has also created a dilemma for the commission . Strictly speaking , the regulatory responsibility of the F.C.C. covers only the interstate system , to which Bell technology has brought new efficiency and steadily declining toll rates . Significent Impact Until a year ago , local regulatory agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F.C.C. happily shared some of the credit for the reduced long-distance charges . Though most of the service problems appeared to be local in origin , the Federal agency 's service inquiry , which began last August , noted that the problems were beginning to have a significant impact on the interstate phone network . Bernard Strassburg , the staff chief of the F.C.C. 's Common Carrier Bureau , observed in an interview last week that " for a long time we were pretty relaxed about the quality of interstate service . " We were complacent , perhaps , but the service was generally good , " he said . " Over the years , " he continued , " if nothing else , they 've been concerned about service . I do n't think that at any level of management , you 'll find a ' public-be-damned ' attitude at Bell . " Certainly , management has made some mistakes , but it has hardly shown a reckless disregard for its responsibilities . So long as the F.C.C. feels the company is maximizing its efforts to rectify the situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mote . A raised eyebrow is often sufI icient. "
