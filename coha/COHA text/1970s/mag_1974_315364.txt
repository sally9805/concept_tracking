The basic issues could not be simpler-even though they have taken 8 months , more than 800 official exhibits and 18,500 pages of court testimony to spell out . Indeed , the federal court suit against Reserve Mining Co. has become the classic pollution case because it poses so sharply the questions of whether or not damage to a region 's environment is worse than damage to the same region 's economy , and of who should pay for cleaning up pollution . Ten plaintiffs , including the Federal Government and the states of Michigan , Wisconsin and Minnesota , want a Reserve plant to stop discharging what they regard as harmful emissions into the air and Lake Superior . In reply , Reserve says that the emissions pose no danger to public health , that to stop them it would have to close down , and that if the governments are so anxious for a cleanup , they should pay for it . <P> Back to Court . Two weeks ago , the case seemed resolved , but the solution was short-lived . Federal District Court Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but fair , abruptly ordered the company to stop its discharges-period . But last week Reserve 's lawyers , arguing that the action would cause " irreparable damage " to the company and the local economy , won a stay of that order . Result : what is already the longest environmental trial in U.S. history will go back to the courts . <P> Reserve Mining , which is owned jointly by Armco Steel and Republic Steel , produces 15% of the U.S. 's iron ore . It mines taconite around Babbitt , Minn. , then ships the flintlike rock 50 miles to Silver Bay , on the shores of Lake Superior . There the iron content of the taconite is extracted , and the wastes , or " tailings , " are dumped into the water . Any time that Reserve is attacked for polluting the lake-and the attacks have been continuous since 1967-it says that it might have to close the plant if ordered to stop . That would wreak economic havoc , since the company employs 3,100 workers in the area , or at least 90% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Justice Department decided to sue for a cleanup anyway . The trial began last summer . <P> The key issue became public health . Asbestos fibers had been discovered in the drinking water that five communities , including Duluth , 60 miles down the shoreline , draw from Lake Superior . Federal scientists pinpoint Reserve 's taconite tailings as the source of the asbestos . Company experts say that the material leaches naturally out of surrounding rock formations . Either way , the minute fibers are dangerous . If ingested or inhaled-and particles have been detected in the air over Reserve 's Silver Bay plant-asbestos can cause cancer .
