txt Ex-addict David Deitch used to think methadone maintenance was a crutch  --  a poor way to treat heroin addiction . As the founder of Daytop Village , a drug-free therapeutic community for drug addicts in New York , Mr. Deitch says , " I was caught up in a faith system where our way  --  the drug-free way  --  was the only right way . " But now he is directing a new " multi-modality " treatment program in San Diego , Calif. , where maintenance on methadone is one of the mainstays . His shift to the use of methadone  --  a conversion of sorts ? is in spite of the obvious drawbacks of methadone : As a synthetic narcotic , methadone is itself addictive and subject to abuse . Concern over numbers And his acceptance of methadone reflects the trend in heroin addiction treatment across the U.S. It is a trend not only toward increasing use of methadone , but toward the " chemotherapeutic , " as opposed to purely " psychotherapeutic , " approach to addiction . " I now view methadone as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a drug-free therapeutic community can ever reach , " Mr. Deitch says . The increasing interest in the use of drugs to treat drug addiction  --  specifically , heroin addiction  --  rises partly out of public frustration with the sheer numbers of heroin addicts . The expansion of methadone main tenance programs has made it possible to double the number of addicts under treatment in New York City in the past year . Still , fewer than 20 percent of the city 's estimated 150,000 addicts are in any treatment program . And no one considers methadone a panacea for heroin addiction . The rise of the chemotherapeutic approach to addiction is evident in the following : , m Methadone maintenance has become the dominant form of treatment in New York , where an estimated half of all U.S. addicts live ; and nationwide , the number of addicts maintained on legal methadone has risen to 25,000. o Drug researchers are experimenting with what they consider more effective sub- stances to fight addiction ? longer-acting forms of methadone , heroin antagonists , and even a possible vaccine . 0 Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most acute , are advocating the clinical use of heroin as a means of drawing in addicts for treatment . The shift to chemotherapy has arisen partly because methadone maintenance was the only treatment that could demonstrate large-scale success . While only about 200 of the some 3,000 persons who have entered New York 's Phoenix House drug-free therapeutic community since 1967 have actually graduated , methadone maintenance programs sometimes show an 80 percent rehabilitation rate . // *Crutch to kick heroin catches on // This statistics game is something like comparing apples and oranges , Phoenix officials complain . One-third of its 1,250 residents are now under 18 and hence , by federal regulations , ineligible for methadone maintenance . Furthermore , some critics of methadone protest that this age requirement is far too low to consign a relatively young heroin addict to a lifetime on methadone . Whether or not a patient can eventually get off methadone maintenance remains problematic . To date , it is estimated that fewer than one-third of the patients who have tried to get off methadone have been successful . " Methadone is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a New York Medical College addiction researcher , " except that it can be taken by mouth , it lasts longer , and it 's legal . " Methadone is said to still an addict 's drug craving for 24 to 36 hours , compared with the 6-to-8-hour duration of a " fix " from heroin . Furthermore , doctors say , methadone does not produce the same euphoric " high " as heroin . But a number of researchers , like Dr. Resnick , think the United States should put more emphasis on another group of addiction treatment drugs  --  the heroin antagonists , as opposed to heroin substitutes like methadone . Since January , 1969 , Dr. Resnick 's progratn has administered the antagonist cyclazocine to 59 patients , and claims a treatment success rate of about 50 percent . Doctors say that heroin antagonists , like methadone , block the effects of heroin if antagonists and heroin are taken together . But unlike methadone , antagonists do not produce a sense of well-being . So , doctors add , a cyclazo4ne patient must be more motivated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to find a longer-acting antagonist drug , so patients would not have to take it every day for an effective block to heroin . And some researchers are even hoping to find a vaccine against heroin addiction . " But that 's very far off , " says Dr. Richard Phillipson of the National Institute of Mental Health . " How do you vaccinate people against the effects of one super-painkillerheroin  --  without vaccinating them against all others as well ? " Any realistic discussion of present forms of addiction treatment , however , return to the central fact : At present , fewer than 20 percent of the heroin addicts in the U.S. are in any form of treatment . Some treatment authorities say the answer is to expand treatment facilities . In fact , waiting lists for methadone maintenance programs range from 2,500 in Detroit to several thousand for the Beth Israel program in New York . But sometime , even advocates of methadone maintenance expansion concede , the U.S. will reach a limit on methadone . " The fact of the matter is that all the known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rehabilitation for only 50 percent of this country 's heroin addicts , " says Dr. William Martin , head of the National Institute of Mental Health 's addiction research center in Bethesda , Md .
