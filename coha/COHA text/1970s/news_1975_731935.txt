txt ON BOARD U.S.S. OKINAwa The last days of the American embassy M Saigon were , full of confusion and uncertainty and during much of the time Ambassador Graham Martin kept evacuation plans ' to himself , refusing to divulge them even to Washington , embassy sources have told The Tribune . " At one point Washington called some of the third echelon people to find out just how many Americans there were in Viet Nam because Martin had not cooperated in sending them , an accurate figure , " one source said . Other embassy sources said they feared that Martin had opted to " go down with the ship , " and up until the very end was not convinced the city ' should have been evacuated . " THAT 'S WHY thousands of America 's Vietnamese employes are still in Saigon and may face punishment from the North Vietnamese , " said one source . " The embassy just waited too long to give evacuation orders . " That the end of America 's involvement in Viet Nam was an emotional blow to Martin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of the evacuation observed Martin walking brazen . ly out an embassy gate around which were gathered thousandsof Vietnamese . " He said he was going to walk to his home . a few blocks away , " said one embassy source , " And when a Marine guard told him it was too dangerous , Martin replied he would walk across Viet Nam if he wanted to , " " I THINK the fact that South Viet-Nam was dying and dying faster than anybody ever thought it would , created a lot of emotional strain on the ambassador , " said one official . The scene at the embassy a week before the evacuation was one ' of almost total confusion as even close Martin aides were kept in the darkabout evacuation plans , according to one source . Correspondents who asked about the plans were told quite franidy that no one had been told anything about leaving . It was known to them , however , that several hundred embassy dependents had been flown out of Saigon several weeks before . " AMBASSADOR MARTIN was very nervous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viet Nam could hang on if a political solution could be worked out , " said one source . However , embassy sources told The Tribune that the political , department of the embassy had informed Martin that there was no hope ' of any kind of political Settlement . " He just teemed to ignore ; that advice and it was n't until most of the people in the political section were told to start working on the evacuation and to stop their political work that it was apparent they would be ' leaving shortly , " one source said . AS A RESULT of Martin 's action , embassy sources charged , , the embassy compound on the day of the evacuation was transformed intohorror shop , with de ? peratea Americans ' climbing frantically over the high embassy wall while thousands of frightened Vietnamese screamed and shouted in the street . This correspondent and other Americans wandered for almost an hour in the streets of Saigon before we found the right evacuation pickup point because the embassy had not kept us informed of where we were supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and were left behind simply because they were not told where they should go , to be picked up . AFTER TAN SON NIIUT air base was bombed Monday by the North Vietnamese and shelled early Tuesday morning , Martin ordered his limousine to drive him to the base so he could personally assess the damage , " Apparently he wanted to see for himself Just how bad it was , " said one source . " And what 0. was really frightening was that he may have hosed his recommendation to evacuate on what he saw . If he had seen the wrong things , we miglitstitill be in Saigon . " While Martin was driving to Tan Son Nhut , thousands of North Vietnamese troops were entering the outskirts of Sal ' gon . There they paused , almost as if they were waiting for the American evacuation to begin . " I 'M SURE THE NVA ( North Vietnamese Army ) let us leave because even tho every , evacuation chopper received some kind of fire from the vow &; I bad the feeling they could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several choppers if they really had wanted to , " said one source . " But what makes many of us who worked at the embassy angry is that Martin ' took numerous calculated risks that he did n't have to take and in that way endangered the lives of every American being evacVoted , " the source added . " In fact , " he source continued , " as far as I am concerned the blood of the two Marines killed by shelling at Tan Son Nhut on the morning of the evacuation is on Martin 's hands . " Upon arrival in the Philippines aboard the U.S.S. Blue Ridge , Martin was flown immediately to Manila , where he met with William . H. Sullivan , U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines . Martin refused to meet with newsmen . FORMER EMBASSY employes have hinted that there should be a Congressional investigation into Martin 's handling of the evacuation and that they would be willing to testify at such a probe . " There was no reason for us to wait until the last possible moment to leave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Marines at Tan Son Nhut were killed , more than 1,000 I Americans lost most of their property because they could n't take it with them , and Vietnamese who were supposed to get out didn't.
