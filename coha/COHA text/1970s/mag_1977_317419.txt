" Fraud . .. deception ... playing with religious tradition . " These harsh words , aimed at a new movement of Jewish-born Christians , spill forth from Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum of the American Jewish Committee , normally one of Judaism 's most temperate envoys to Christianity . His target : the so-called Messianic Jews , who insist that they can adopt a belief in Jesus as the Messiah and yet remain as Jewish as ever . <P> In the earliest days of the church , of course . Christians were accepted as being Jews , and the Messianic Jews say they are trying to re-establish those bygone days . Ever since the two faiths divided , however , proselytism has been one of their touchiest disputes , exacerbated by Christian anti-Semitism and centuries of forced conversions . Most Jews fiercely resent all proselytizing , and many Christian denominations now oppose organized efforts to convert Jews . <P> Shun Labels . Among the Messianic Jews , however , proselytizing is part of the faith . Exactly what that faith is , though , is confusing to the outsider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the deity of Christ , which Judaism considers idolatry , they often shun labels like " convert " or " Christian . " Some retain Jewish traditions like Saturday worship and the wearing of skullcaps , or call their leaders " rabbis " and their meeting places " synagogues . " To Jewish leaders such as Tanenbaum , they are simply Christian evangelists masquerading as Jews to gain more converts . In any case , since the late 1960s , perhaps 10,000 to 20,000 young U.S. Jews have decided to follow Jesus . <P> Much of the tumult in the movement is now swirling around a Pentecostal group in Stony Brook . Long Island , called B'nai Yeshua ( Sons of Jesus ) , which draws up to 200 people for Friday-night services and claims to run the world 's first major " messianic training center . " It has 30 students at present and 31 full-time evangelists who are waging a summer campaign . <P> This month B'nai Yeshua dedicated its twelve-acre , $1,105,000 estate during a conference attended by 700 believers , about two-thirds of them Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auctioneer over fund-raising appeals ( " Tell every single person what you want them to do . Lord " ) and faith-healing marathons ( " There 's a man with a gall bladder problem sitting over there . Well , you 're God 's beloved " ) . At one point Evans appealed for commitments to Jesus , blending Jewish terminology with tent revivalism : " Great God of Israel , I need forgiveness for my sins . I believe that Yeshua Jesus is the Messiah . " <P> Professing amazement at the opposition B'nai Yeshua has aroused from Long Island Jews and Establishment Protestants , Evans says : " We are just a bunch of young Jewish kids . " Evans , who was given a weak religious upbringing by his Jewish mother , ran a Texas Bible camp until he felt God tell him that a great revival was coming in the New York City area . Despite his Jewish emphasis , he gets backing from such Gentile Pentecostal stalwarts as Christian Broadcaster Pat Robertson and Evangelist David Wilkerson.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
