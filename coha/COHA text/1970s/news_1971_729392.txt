It is intended , rather , to make dying more dignified in a day when it most often occurs in harsh institutional settings amid strangers and elaborate medical equipment .

In short , it is directed at making death easier to take for the person who dies , the professionals who attend him and the survivors who loved Ilim . of the d iiv ; patient has become increasingly important now that swift deaths from acute illnesses like pneumonia are rare and many if not most people die over months or years from chronic , degenerative diseases like cancer . Can their passing be made less dehumanizing , less psychologically painful ? Another impetus to the new interest in the subject of death has been the finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than other people their age to suffer physical illness and death during the period of bereavement , Is there a way to soften the blow ?

" The patient can not accept the fact that he has a fatal illness . Somelimes patients are unable to pass out of this stage and , as a result , die with much unfinished business . Other times it is the family that can not accept the fatal prognosis . In most people , however , Dr. Ross found , denial quickly give way to anger and ' rage  --  the " Why me ? " stage . .. The patient becomes hard to ' - handle , overtly critical , nasty and uncooperative . The people around him react by making visits shorter and less frequent , by jabbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said the Illinois psychiatrist , is to make the r tient feel even more deprived , isolated and rejected .

" The worst thing you can do at this stage is call in a psychiatrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient is not behaving properly , that he should shape up ? ' Cheer up , things are not so bad . ' Not so bad for whom ? A widow is encouraged to grieve and she has suffered the loss of only one person . A dying person is suffering the loss of everyone and everything he has ever loved . His grief is a thousand times greater , He should be told , ' I admire you for crying . It takes a man to cry . ' " Finally , the dying person enters the last stage , acceptance ? " My time is very close now and it 's all right , " Dr. Ross said , " This is not a happy stage , but neither is it unhappy .

I would want to , know . The complicated ruses , deceptions , explanations , were incredible : The heartbreak of watching her thinking she was improving , while I knew that any improvement was temporary . I remember her saying as we woke up one morning , ' I 've decided that I am not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake up one morning completely well . ' " Sometimes the physician recognizes the importance of dealing truthfully with his fatally ill patients but the family thwarts him . Sixteen-year-old Fred was dying of leukemia .
