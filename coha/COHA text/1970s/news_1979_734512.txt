Their prospects of seeing the captive Americans seemed remote . The only real hopeful sign came from Khomeini in a Christmas message calling upon American Christians to demand that President Carter extradite the deposed shah , who is now in Panama . Khomeini seemed clearly to be trying to tell Americans that the hostages  --  all of them  --  eventually would be freed .
