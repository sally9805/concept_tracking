Puffing through a park or panting along a highway , joggers are unquestionably helping their hearts . But are they shedding poundage as well ? No , say three U.S. Air Force researchers in the A.M.A. Journal : exercise alone ca n't do it . A runner of medium weight who wishes to shed a pound of fat on a one-shot basis must expend 3,500 calories , which means that he must run for well over an hour . <P> Still , say the doctors , exercise is an important element of any weight-control program . The trio figured the actual caloric consumption for men of various weights running a jogger 's common distance of 1.5 miles in times ranging from eight to 16 minutes . They found that a 170-lb. man who can cover this distance in eight minutes burns 175 calories . This may not seem like much , but the Air Force physicians note that a runner who does this regularly can lose ten pounds a year-if he does not increase his caloric intake . In fact , if a runner on a 2,600-calorie-per-day diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat himself to a small piece of cake every night and still keep his weight constant . <P> &gt; Large numbers of Westerners have come to accept the idea that acupuncture can help alleviate pain . But doctors have expressed doubts about another claim advanced for the ancient Oriental art : needle wielding can relieve nerve deafness , a hearing loss caused by damage to the cranial nerve that serves the ear . Their skepticism has been bolstered by two new reports . <P> A team of Michigan State University researchers states in the A.M.A. 's Archives of Otolaryngology ( a journal for ear , nose and throat specialists ) that it observed an acupuncturist with 15 years of experience administer eight treatments to a deaf World War II veteran . Testing the man 's hearing before , during and after the treatments , the researchers could discern no measurable improvement . <P> The other report-to the American Laryngology , Rhinology and Otology Society-was presented by Dr. Samuel Rosen , a New York City otologist who learned acupuncture three years ago as one of the first American physicians to visit Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their hearing disorders and found that only two showed improvement , and that was slight . <P> &gt; Doctors have long been puzzled about the cause of primary dyslexia , a common learning disorder that afflicts between 2% and 5% of all U.S. schoolchildren with average or superior intelligence , and interferes with their ability to read . Most researchers assume that the root of the problem is in the cortex , site of the brain centers involved with thinking and learning . But two New York City doctors offer a different explanation-one that could lead to earlier diagnosis of this disorder .
