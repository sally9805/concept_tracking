txt Against a backdrop of past abuses , President Carter and Congress are expediting efforts to get firmer , centralized control over America 's intelligence network . Two major changes will help the nation 's elected officials keep closer tabs on the budgets and tasks performed by supersecret agencies , including the National Security Agency , the National Reconnaissance Office , and the Central Intelligence Agency . President Carter , through executive order , plans to centralize control over the intelligence community in a new chief , who is expected to be Stansfield Turner , current director of the CIA . And in late September , Congress is expected to begin hearings on charters for the CIA , the NSA , and possibly the FBI 's counterintelligence branch . Those hearings could eventually result in creation of a new director of national intelligence . a Cabinet-level position . The President 's plans for the intelligence community were being revealed here as news unfolded ( ) I ' additional questionable activities by the Central Intelligence Agency . Director Turner told a Senate committee that during an II-year period that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving behavior alteration with drugs at 80 prisons . hospitals , universities , and other institutions . Often unwitting citizens were treated with LSD and marijuana , toxins , electroshock , and other methods to determine their effects on human behavior // From page 1 Bringing spies in from the heat Admiral Turner said such practices were phased out more than a decade ago , and are no longer being used . The current intelligence setup in Washington is felt by some experts to have two major drawbacks which helped bring about such abuses . First , there is no central-intelligence chief . Although he is head of the CIA , Admiral Turner controls only a fraction of the total intelligence budget . Most of the budget lies under the jurisdiction of the Defense Department , with numerous other portions scattered among additional bureaus in this city . Second , there is felt to be too little central direction of intelligence objectives and goals . The President 's executive order would put budget and assignment authority in one office , Cie current director of the CIA . There is sentiment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a director of national intelligence and a separate operating head of the CIA . But Sen. Walter Huddleston ( D ) of Kentucky , chairman of the intelligence subcommittee on charters and guidelines , said after speaking to the President on Aug. 4 that Mr. Carter " did n't go that far . " So the two jobs might not be separated . Throughout the maneuvering on reorganization , the Defense Department has had the most to lose . Its National Security Agency and National Reconnaissance Office operate wide-ranging electronic and satellite networks which eat up what is believed to be more than $3 billion of the nation 's estimated $5 billion to $6 billion intelligence budget . If the Defense Department disagreed with the new intelligence chief 's decisions , it could appeal to a select committee of the National Security Council . That committee , however , would be headed by the new intelligence chief . Day-to-day operating authority over the NSA and NRO , meanwhile , would remain with the Secretary of Defense . The final form emerging here indicates President Carter is striving for a compromise which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a myopic view of the nation 's needs .
