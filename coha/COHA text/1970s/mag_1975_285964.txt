It began as the race of the year when the two horses broke from the starting gate at New York 's Belmont Park for the much-ballyhooed mile-and-a-quarter match race . The contest between the record-breaking three-year-old filly Ruffian , winner in all ten of her starts and holder of the filly 's Triple Crown for 1975 , and the Kentucky Derby-winning colt Foolish Pleasure was a perfect Him v. Her extravaganza for the 50,764 people at Belmont and for millions watching on CBS , which put up $350,000 to televise the event . Then , 3 furlongs and some 35 seconds into the race , with Ruffian slightly ahead , there was a sharp snap . " Like a pistol shot , " said the filly 's jockey Jacinto Vasquez . Ruffian 's right front ankle had cracked . The cheering faded as the afflicted horse pounded on , then slowed to a stop with the fragile sesamoid bones above the hoof completely shattered . Within nine hours Ruffian was dead , put down with the assent of her owners , Mr. and Mrs. Stuart Janney Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing fraternity . But for sportswriters and just plain enthusiasts , it was a beginning of controversy over the cause of the accident and the quality of medical treatment the stricken Ruffian received . <P> There were immediate charges that the track was unusually fast that day , and thus too hard for Ruffian 's legs . Replied Track Superintendent Joe King vehemently : " The day of the race , the 3%-inch sandy loam surface was normal , and we had normal moisture conditions . " Other observers felt that Ruffian 's first match race placed her under unusual stress . Noted one racehorse owner , " When you figure that 1,125 Ibs are being carried on cannon bones as thick as broomsticks , it is a wonder that such an accident does n't happen more often . " However , another compelling hypothesis emerged days after the tragedy , when a film showed four pigeons flapping off from the track as the two horses approached , seeming to startle Ruffian . Vasquez doubts the thes ory : " We see those birds every day . Most horses do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident . If she had shied away from the birds , I would have felt it . " <P> The medical treatment given the huge filly caused more comment . Immediately after Ruffian , her foreleg in an air-inflated splint , was moved to her trainer 's barn , a mob of doctors , track officials and hangers-on descended . <P> Questions arose over the drugs that Veterinary Dr. Alex Harthill administered , which , some charge , worsened the horse 's physical condition during surgery-though perhaps any sedation might have . Harthill 's presence in itself was controversial since he does not have a New York license arid had been disciplined by the Kentucky state racing commission for giving an illegal painkiller to one of the 1968 Derby contestants . <P> The decision for a quick operation also raised doubts .
