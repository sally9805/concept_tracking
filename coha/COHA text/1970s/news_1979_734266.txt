txt As gasoline lines shortened in the New York metropolitan area yesterday , Governor Carey imposed a minimum-sale requirement in the city and surrounding suburban counties to discourage " topping off " by motorists who already have nearly full tanks . Drivers will be charged at least $5 for any purchase for a fourcylinder car and at least $7 for cars with six cylinders nr more me change , effective 12:01 A.M. today in New York City and five nearby counties , replaced a previous requirement that purchases be made only when cars had half a tank of fuel or less . Mr. Carey said that service stations had found this difficult to enforce . The counties outside of the city affected by the new order are Nassau , Suffolk , Westchester , Rockland and Putnam . New Jersey already has the $5 and $7 minimum-purchase rule , while Connecticut has called for $4 buys for small cars and $6 for lame . The Walt Is Shorter Motorists in all three states found gasoline station lines significantly shorter yesterday than a week ago . The improvement was credited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into effect in the New York metropolitan area and Connecticut on June 20 and in New Jersey on June 21 . However , preliminary figures that the Federal Department of Energy said it had received from oil companies indicated that less gasoline is scheduled to arrive in New York State and New Jersey during July than in June ? 1 and 2 percent less , respectively . Robert A. Low , the department's-regional representative , said these forecasts might improve later in the month with the end of disruptions from the recent tugboat strike and trucker demonstrations and with a hope for more imports from abroad . Meanwhile Governor Carey , Governor Byrne of New Jersey and Gov . Ella T. Grasso of Connecticut reported they had spoken to President Carter in a joint telephone conference call late yesterday . Each Governor reported that the President had told them that under a new interpretation of a Federal rule , oil companies were being allowed to increase their gasoline allocations to states with shortages by diverting up . to 5 percent of their national supply from other states . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this provision , and relief for gas-short urban areas appeared afore likely to come from intrastate shifts that the Governors could order . In still another action , Governor Carey told a news conference here that 12.5 million gallons of gasoline ? half the regular July set-aside that is at the state government 's command ? was being released for fuel stations in the 10-county downstate , area to help them meet peak demands during the first 10 days of July , including tomorrow 's Fourth of July holiday and next weekend . During June , gasoline deliveries in New York State appeared to have dropped even more than projected in initial forecasts . Whereas the companies estimated at the start of the month that there would ? be an 8.4 percent decline from the June 1978 total , their estimates at the end of . last week were that there had been a 12.7 percent fall-off . They reported delivery of 11,260,000 barrels , each barrel containing 42 gallons of gasoline , against 12,897,000 barrels a year ago . For New Jersey , the first forecasts had been for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 9.2 percent . Deliveries of 6,848,000 barrels of gasoline were reported , against 7,541,000 a year ago . Lower July Deliveries The first July estimates call for New York State to get 11,224,000 barrels , down 12.3 percent from 12,804,000 a year ago . For New Jersey , the prediction is for 6,701,000 barrels , down 10.5 per cent from 7,490,000 a year ago . State set-asides of 5 percent ' are first skimmed off these deliveries , and then defense and agricultural users are allowed to get their full current needs . as certified by each customer individually to his supplier ? a provision that some critics say may have been abused . The July allocations by oil companies for retailers in New York State and New Jersey were reported by Mr. Low 's office as follows , with percentages comparing with the total delivered in July 1978 : Agway , 75 percent ; Amerada Hess , 95 ; Amoco , 77 ; Ashland ; 75 ; Arco , 85 ; BP , 85 ; Champlin , 87 ; Chevron , .85 ; Cibro , 126 ; Cities Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65 ; Crown Central , 88 ; Exxon , 78 ; Getty , 70 ; Gulf , 75 ; Mobil , 82 ; Northville , 99 ; Pennzoil , 57 ; Quaker State , 77 ; Shell , 68 ; Sun , 70 ; Tenneco , 80 ; Texaco , 70 ; Triangle , 85 ; Union , 80 , and United Refining , 80 . Governor Carey reported " encouraging signs " that the odd-even sales system was beginning to restore order to gasoline marketing . But he said there might be difficulties as the month neared its end . So he said he was pressing President Carter for a change in gasoline allocation Holes that he said had " rewarded " states showing increases ? possibly wasteful increases ? in gasoline use . The rule gives dealers the alternative of basing their allocations on a five-month average base period from last October through last February , instead of on a comparison with the same months year ago . Mr. Carey contended that states that had been conserving gasoline were " being penalized . " New York State gasoline use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , while some other states have gone up 7 and 8 percent . " Only pressure changes minds in Washington , and we 're trying to generate thatpressure , " Mr. Carey added . Reporting on the telephone conference call to President Carter , Governor Carey said that oil companies would be able to transfer 5 percent of their national supplies at any time to any state needing help . In Trenton , Governor Byrne said that President Carter believed that an interpretation of Federal rules " now clearly allows the oil companies to respond to our identified areas of spot shortages . " In Hartford , Governor Grasso said that she would ask major oil companies to redirect supplies so that Connecticut 's allocation would be closer to the national average . She said that in June the state got about 81 percent as much gasoline as in June 1978 , compared with a national average of 89 percent . In Washington , a White House press aide said that the primary impact of shifts in supplies was expected to be within each state , from one area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Department of Energy said that its general counsel had issued a ruling yesterday clarifying regulations so that " if a state Governor declares that a severe gasoline shortage exists in one or more areas of his state , the suppliers may rely on that determination as a basis for redirecting gasoline to those areas .
