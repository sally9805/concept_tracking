An endangered aphrodisiac ? <P> <P> What has five leaves , grows wild over nuch of the U.S. and is so prized by users round the world that certain varieties sell in unprocessed form for as much as $2,000 an ounce ? One clue : it now faces an embargo because concerned Government officials are about to cut out flourishing traffic in the plant between the U.S. and the Far East . Portions of the description might apply to marijuana , heroin or cocaine , but the only product that meets all specifications is ginseng . <P> For centuries ginseng , a root often shaped vaguely like a human body , has been touted in Asia as an aphrodisiac , an aid to long life and a cure for everything from cancer to baldness . A small but growing number of Americans buy it in drug and health-food stores in the form of a gooey black liquid , tablets , tea and even ginseng soap . Almost all finished ginseng products sold here are imported from South Korea and other Asian countries that process the roots-but a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plant , which measures a foot in height , grows wild in a large area reaching eastward from the Ozarks and is cultivated commercially . The mature root , usually four inches long , weighs less than an ounce . Diggers send the roots to a handful of dealers , like Willard Magee in Eolia , Mo. ; he will mail back a check based on wholesale prices ( currently $95 to $110 per lb. for wild and $45 to $50 for cultivated ) . Though wild ginseng accounts for only 26% of U.S. production , it commands much higher prices than the cultivated variety because it is thought to be more potent . The U.S. cultivated ginseng industry is centered in Marathon County in central Wisconsin , which happens to have the welldrained , acidic soil ideal for growing ginseng . There , an estimated 65 farmers grow about 95% of cultivated U.S. ginseng . <P> Just about all U.S. ginseng is exported to the Far East , mostly to Hong Kong . Though the ginseng trade is small in numbers of people involved , it has grown lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because Asian supplies are not enough to meet Asian demand , U.S. ginseng exports have rocketed from $5 million in 1970 to almost $18 million last year . <P> As trade has flourished , the supply of wild ginseng has decreased-some experts estimate by as much as 20% during the past decade . Rising prices have encouraged even more ginseng digging , and this has further depleted supplies . So the Government is considering putting wild ginseng on a list of endangered species Washington already requires licenses for exports of wild ginseng , and the brand-new , four-member U.S. Endangered Species Scientific Authority banned exports of wild ginseng altogether last month , but exempts states that require a permit to dig wild roots .
