THE TALI ( OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WHEN the Radio City Musk Hall Corporation announced its plan recently to close down the Music Hall and mentioned that proposals have been made to replace it with a new hotel , some tennis courts , and new office space , the Show People 's Committee to Save Radio City Music Hall , a group of activist citizens , immediately sprang into existence and set about appealing at various levels of the government for funds to keep the place going . One of the most striking justifications for making such an effort was suggested by Jack Kroll , the movie and drama critic of Newsweek , who argued for federal subsidization of the Hall . " The commercial aspects of the Music Hail operation should n't distract us from its unique and crucial role in the culture , indeed the consciousness , of the nation , " Kroll wrote in an article that recently appeared on Newsweek 's " 11,1y Turn " page . " To subsidize the Music Hall is to subsidize part of that consciousness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal dollars is a new one . An ecological approach to the problem recommends itself . Having recognized the importance of the natural environment , shall we let the mental environment go to ruin ? The issue runs deeper than any questions of taste . The true ecologist of the national consciousness would not let mere aesthetic standards determine whether or not some beloved object  --  some building , theatre , or public square  --  should be saved , any more than the environmentalist lets aesthetics determine which species shall be saved . And , indeed , the test of aesthetics is one that the Music Hall , whose architecture , as Kroll points out , combines the Egyptian with the Martian , and thus manages to be simultaneously futuristic and passe , would probably fail . But time selects things for respect  --  the Eiffel Tower , the pyramids  --  that good taste would probably overlook , or even contemptuously dis miss . These things are simply and inexplicably there , like natural wonders . ( In fact , it might not be a bad idea to turn the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which could show it to tourists in its off-hours as a sort of man-made , urban cave . ) Inevitably , any inventory of the things that have stuck in a nation 's collective mind is going to be odd and unpredictable , and in our nation 's case it must include certain military uniforms ( which keep turning up on the unlikeliest people ) , the grilles and tail fins of certain cars , and the movies of certain decades ( the thirties and the forties ) but not of other decades ( the fifties and the sixties ) . Strange to say , however , it looks at this point as though our present decade  --  a virtual graveyard of original , spontaneous popular enthusiasms  --  might have very little to contribute . And that may explain a lot . There seems to be a tendency for things that , from the point of view of consciousness , are something , such as the Music Hall , to be driven out by things that are nothing , such as the new hotel , the tennis courts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading nothingness , rather than a love of what is beautiful , that makes the Show People 's Committee to Save Radio City Music Hall and many other people unfriendly to things that are standardized , repeatable , and ubiquitous , and therefore leave no imprint on their minds , and makes them cherish with a new intensity things that , like Radio City Music Hall , are distinctive , unrepeatable , and rooted in their time and place , and arc therefore hospitable to notice , affection , and a place in their memories  --  or , if you will , in the national consciousness . ? ? Pippo ONE recent morning , we noticed an advertisement at the Forty-second Street station of the Sixth Avenue subway . The advertisement was for a beauty salon called Pippo of Rome . It said " WE MAKE EVERYONE LOOK THEIR BEST ! " and " 14 INTERNATIONALLY FAMOUS HAIRCUTTERS . ALL UNDER THE PERSONAL SUPERVISION OF PIPPO OF ROME . " After peace and justice , there is nothing in the world we like more than for everyone to look his or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's jokes , there is almost nothing we find funnier than Internationally Famous Haircutters and any noun followed by the words " of Rome . " Encountering the advertisement , therefore , impelled us to visit Pippo of Rome , which proved to be a unisex beauty salon . We met Pippo himself  --  Mr. Pippo Guastella  --  and thought he was great . He looked like pictures we remembered seeing some years ago of Carlo Ponti , the Italian film producer who is now married to Sophia Loren . Pippo was dressed in sky blue : pants , shirt , and sweater all exactly the same shade . He introduced us to some of the internationally known hairdressers . He told us that he had studied hairdressing in Rome and had worked there in a shop on the Via Veneto ; that he had wnrkcd in Rome for a man called Frank the Neapolitan ; that Cary Grant , Gregory Peck , Rosalind Russell , the President of Italy , and other famous people used to have their hair done at Frank the Neapolitan 's place ; that he himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to New York because everybody comes to New York ; that he had opened his first salon in New York in 1959 and by 1960 it had taken off ; and that he changed the furniture in his salon every two years . The furniture that he now has is in the Chesterfield style . Pippo then showed us an Italian men 's magazine called UOMO . As he showed us pictures of snappily dressed men with precision-styled hair , he said , " In Italy , it 's different from here . As you know , there is a lot of art over there , and this makes everybody  --  hairdressers , designers  --  very conscious of personality . When a customer comes in , you take everything into consideration . Face , personality  --  everything . I get all Italian magazines , because they keep me on top of things . In America , everybody wants to look the same . Same haircut , same clothes . But I give all my customers something different , to fit their personalities . I used to do the hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puffed out like this ! " Pippo made a face like a balloon , and then made a sound like air escaping from a balloon . " He would wear his hair flat on top , making him look even puffier . So I styled his hair so that he looks all slimmed down . He 's a very nice man . Then , I do Barry Farber . He is more philosophic , and these philosophers do n't take care of themselves . I first saw him as a judge in a Miss America pageant . He was wearing a nice suit and he looked nice , but his hair was a mess . Then , one day , I sec him in the lobby of the WOR building and I tell him what I think of him , and since then he has been coming to me to do his hair . In other words , I brought out his personality . A long time ago , I styled the hair of Tony Lo Bianco , but then he went to Hollywood . Now I style his brother John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man 's hair . He had introduced the man to us as a special and long-standing customer . Pippo washed the man 's hair once with a shampoo called Superstar Professional Shampoo . Then he cut the hair by dividing it up into very small sections and cutting off a half inch or so . Then he massaged the man 's scalp , fluffed up his hair , and trained some hair-drying lamps on it . After Pippo was done , the man looked just like a celebrity on local television . Skytrain " IT was n't just the food aspect of Skytrain I liked . I found the whole atmosphere and all the people sympathetic . " A young Englishwoman we know , who often travels between New York and her native land , was telling us about her latest trip , made to London and back by way of Freddie Laker 's airline . " The sort of luggage people had , for instance , " she said . " There were a lot of those rainbow-colored backpack things , of course , and a few pairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shabby , ordinary-looking , hand-me-down suitcases that ordinary English people take on trains . There was n't any Vuitton stuff or a matching set of anything in sight . I found it all rather comforting , because most people would call my luggage a disgrace . I have a weird assortment of awful-looking old bags . I have one I bought in Korvettes , with a stain from where a jar of marmalade burst . I have one from the British Home Stores , and it has a temperamental hinge , but I sometimes use it anyway and tie it up with string . I have a prim little leatherette thing that was my mother 's when she was a private nurse , before the war . Some combination of my luggage is always exactly right for whatever bundles I happen to be shunting from A to B. I usually do n't take many clothes , because I have those at either end , but I always have masses of queer , untouristy things , like half-eaten Christmas cakes , old doorknobs , packets of seeds , and half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bees . I am scrupulously honest , and on my customs-declaration form I write down absolutely everything I 've acquired . The men are usually so taken aback by the list that they do n't even bother to open my bags . " As one whose bags and souvenirs are invariably subject to rough and suspicious search in customs , we suppressed an impulse to complain . Instead , we asked her to tell us about eating on Skytrain . " The system is so liberating , once you 've got the hang of it and make sure you take your own food , " she said . " You know how tediously important sustenance can seem when you 're flying the Atlantic , and how you 're at the mercy of the stewardesses . You long for them to bring you a cocktail and then that rotten little plastic tray . And then you long even more for them to come and take away the debris afterward . You realize that it was n't food or a drink you wanted , after all , but room to cross your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life . " Did n't they provide food at all on Sky train , we asked . " Yes , and I made the mistake of paying a few dollars extra for it when I booked my flight out of New York , " she said . " They rang up my ticket on a huge cash register , then stapled on a little yellow card for a ' Cold Meal ' and a little green one for ' Hot Breakfast . ' But it was early in the morning , by my standards , when I booked , and sixteen hours before I would be eating on the plane that night . If I were the sort of person who could plan ahead properly , I would n't he so thrilled by the last-minute way-you can set off on Sky-train . Another reason I did n't have my wits about me was that I was bowled over by being in the Laker office nut in this amazing place called Rego Park . I mean , have you ever been to the heart of Queens ? Everything 's either in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and launderettes in Tudor style . Miles and miles of drive-in this and drive-in that , and places to get your wheels aligned or your muffler fixed . " What was her opinion of Laker food ? " As it happened , I was n't hungry when they served the first meal , because I 'd just had a huge dinner with some friends , " she said . " And I was too sleepy to bother with breakfast . So I never got round to holding up my little yellow and green cards . I thought the people who did looked a hit pathetic , somehow , like children in an orphanage . But I caught enough of a glimpse of the food that was given in exchange for the cards to admire the man across the aisle , who 'd come prepared with a splendid-looking roast-beef sandwich and a bottle of good wine . He knew the ropes so well that he would n't even pay a quarter to get a cup of coffee . The stewardess pretended to he cross with him , and told him he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laker rich , but you could tell she really thought he was smart . On my way back to New York , there were six young people who stood for most of the way huddled , under a photograph of Maharaj Ji , meditating and chanting softly to a guitar . All they seemed to eat among them was a big bag of apples , but I thought that was taking " Just give me some space , Milton . " self-stifficiencv too far . I had brought along a yogurt , some oranges , and a sandwich with brown bread I 'd made myself . Eating them just when I felt like it was perfect bliss . " By now , we had become convinced enough of Skytrain 's advantages to volunteer some depressing anecdotes about our own experiences on non-Laker flights . " You know what I like mast about Skytrain ? " our friend asked . " Once and for all , it scotches the notion that flying the Atlantic  --  except , perhaps , on the Concorde or in first class  --  has anything to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years , actually , but some lingering idea of glamour clung to stewardesses and passengers and made them all a bit grumpy . It 's all one class on Skytrain , so when you walk down that accordion-hose thing into the nose of the plane you do n't pass through any first-class section and have a tantalizing glimpse of other people 's glamour , either . As a matter of fact , when we boarded at Gatwick on our return we all had to walk across the tarmac and climb up an ordinary covered staircase . With me in the shuffling queue were sleeping babies and wide-awake grandmothers and rich-looking businessmen . There was a pair of white-blond Scandinavian lovers and a working-class lad from Newcastle with a tin of pale ale in his hand . There were the six apple-eaters , clutching the picture of their guru together with their boarding passes , and a very old , fervent-looking man in Chassidic garb . It was a black , foggy night , and there we all were , with our funny bundles and our sandwiches , filing up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane . " Faith A we were having breakfast at 6 A.M. in a seedy coffee shop on Amsterdam Avenue one snowy morning recently , staring half asleep into a mirrored display case full of venerable pies while our mind began , slowly , to clank and rattle and hiss , like an old radiator ( but still no heat ) , the only other people at the counter were a small middle-aged man next to us and a counterman with his head on his arms ( sleeping , we hoped ; not totalled by the cuisine ) . Then an elderly woman in a vivacious blond wig bustled in , looked around at the customers in some nearby booths , looked at the man next to us , threw her purse on the counter , and plopped down two seats away from him . Fixing the man with a laser gaze ( magnified by glasses ) , she began a non-stop rundown on love , loneliness , the loss of one 's glasses , ambition , greed , snow removal , money , pride , crime in the subway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mysterious yet effective workings of the Lord . The man nodded , and ate , and she went on . She described how various celebrities had been brought to heel for their hubris , and how some of the humble  --  herself included  --  had been raised up . At the end of the lesson , she admitted that although she was extremely hungry for a thirty-five-cent bowl of soup , she was not going to worry about it , because the Lord would provide . At this point , the man said goodbye , and we watched him pay his check at the cash register . He left an extra dollar , and mumbled instructions to the cashier , who indicated a readiness to carry them out . Then , as the man pushed open the glass door to face the dark city and its snow , a very familiar voice shrieked cheerfully across the coffee shop , " Thank you ! " Delivery ATYPICAL issue of Back Stage , the weekly show-biz trade paper , carries announcements of some eighty casting calls . The job possibilities run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Line ' will hold an open call for dancers who have not previously auditioned " ) to highly unlikely ( " A final casting has been announced for Finding Rob 's Feet , ' a Grad NYU sync-sound film " ) . Eager job-seekers , upon presenting themselves for an audition , take care to emphasize that they are " very available " for work . A few weeks ago , Musicbox , Inc. , a Brooklyn-based company that composes singing telegrams  --  called Musicgrams and delivers them either by telephone or in person , ran an ad in Bach Stage to announce auditions for a fresh crop of couriers . About thirty very available people answered the call . The recipient of a telephone-delivered Musicgram on the occasion of , say , a birthday does n't get a mere impersonal rendition of " Happy Birthday to You . " Rather , he hears a totally original song ( music and lyrics ) written for the occasion by one of Musicbox 's staff of composers or perhaps by Dean Foster , who , along with his wife , Sheryl Sims-Foster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music and lyrics for Musicgrams , he profitably employs himself writing songs in the Barry Manilow/Paul Williams vein . " Those are separate and apart from Musicgrams , " he explained to us the other day . " A Musicgram falls somewhere between a jingle and a song . We interview our customers . Let 's say the customer tells us that he wants to send a get-well message to Aunt Sally , who just had an operation and happens to hate cabbage . We can easily fit surgery and cabbage into a song . It 's not that much of a strain . " A courier-delivered Musicgram ordinarily has only original lyrics , set to a standard tune , but it can be thrilling and spectacular nevertheless . The courier , whether male or female , arrives dressed in tuxedo , top hat , and white gloves , and offers a song with lyrics so shamelessly tortured that the United Nations might want to investigate . A Musicgram marriage proposal , for instance , might be sung to the tune of " Clementine " or " Old Smokey , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pm warns for your form ; I 'm also enamored of your kneecaps . " The company has been in business only three years , so there are not yet any definitive statistics on how many of these proposals result in lasting marriages . The auditions for the Musicgram couriers were held in a recording-company office on Broadway in the Fifties and were presided over by Sheryl Sims-Foster . Before settling down to work , she told us that business had been good lately and that she could envision " an army of tuxedoed people running all over the city someday . " The prospective couriers who filed through the office during the next three hours included a few young men and women who appeared to harbor serious fantasies about singing " Lucia di Lammermoor " " Otello " at the Met but , while waiting for that to happen , needed to earn a living . These people sounded out of their element singing Mrs. SimsFoster 's favorite audition tune , which is " Give My Regards to Broadway . " A few other auditioners sounded out of their element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone . At the conclusion of each audition , she said , " We 'll be letting you know in a few days . What 's your schedule like ? " When she asked this question of John Deylc , a young actor and bass . baritone who had just serenaded her with a few bars of " OP Man River , " he answered , " My schedule ? Right now , I 'm completely free . Very available . " " Well , that 's good . You 're an excellent singer , " she said . " Thanks , " he said . " I wan na wear the top hat . " A couple of days later , John DeyIe found our that he had been hired . A few days after that , having acquired THE NEW YORKER his costume , he was ready to embark upon his first delivery  --  a birthday greeting in Sheepshead Bay , in Brooklyn . We had agreed to stop by for him at his apartment , a studio near Lincoln Center , and when we arrived he had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he examined himself in a mirror . He is tall and solidly built , has a squarish face and a light-brown beard , wears glasses , and , when he speaks , sounds a good deal like Steve Allen . " Them , " he said , adjusting his bow tie . " If I fix my scarf correctly under my overcoat , I 'll be able to hide the bow tie . Then , when I ride the subway to Brooklyn , look like a waiter on my way to work , instead of like a clown . " fie pulled a pair of driving gloves over his white gloves , picked up a dance bag containing his top hat , and was ready to go . As we made our way to Brooklyn on the train  --  actually , four trains and a bus , thanks to some unnecessarily complicated directions furnished by the Transit Authority  --  Deyle told us that he grew up in Rochester , New York ; that he graduated from a college in North Carolina ; that he had just finished playing the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia Woolf ? " in Portland , Maine ; that he hoped to get an Equity card soon ; that he would be paid for his deliveries on a piecework basis and would not receive his accumulated pay until the end of the week ; and that the money he had just spent to buy six subway tokens represented a considerable portion of his net worth . " At the moment , I have four dollars to my name , " he said . " I had seven before I bought the tokens . Occasionally , when my funds get really low , I see a picture of myself in Times Square handing out those flyers for massage parlors  --  you know , the ' Check it out ' routine . I 've actually gone as far as to find out that that pays two-seventyfive an hour and you get paid at the end of each day . I 'm not really worried , though , because something always comes along . Like this job . I think it 's much better than waiting on tables or driving a cab . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our stop now  --  Ocean Parkway and Brighton Beach Avenue  --  and Deyle began to consider whether his costume looked right . " The length of the jacket is really perfect , " he said , " hut in general the fit is awfully blousy . I like the wing collar on my shirt , though , and I 've added a pair of my own cufflinks . Also , I 'm wearing a red garter on my shirtsleeve . It 's a good-luck charm from my girlfriend . " Following the bus ride and a ten-minute walk , we reached the destination  --  a high-rise apartment house . In the lobby , a teen-age girl was waiting for the elevator . She watched Deyle remove his overcoat and scarf , then flex his white-gloved hands . When she saw him bring out his top hat , she decided to use the stairs . " She 's afraid to get into the elevator with a tuxedo , " Deyle said . " I do n't blame her . " The elevator stopped at an upper floor , where Deyle got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Customs Service employee , celebrant that day of Birthday No. 55 , husband of Rhoda , father of Lisa and Cathy , and father-in-law of Sherm Bangel , who had ordered the Musicgram . A man answered the door , and Deyle announced , " I have a Musicgram for Kenneth Pukel . " The man said he was Kenneth Pukel , whereupon Deyle , still standing in the hallway , proceeded to sing birthday greetings to the tune of the familiar " Give My Regards to Broadway . " The lyrics mentioned Rhoda , Lisa , Cathy , Sherm , the family dogs ( Brandy and Rufus ) , and the facts that Mr. Pukel plays a so-so game of tennis and always bones his fish meticulously . During the song , Sherm and Cathy took a lot of photographs . When Deyle had finished , he tipped his top hat and headed for the elevator , leaving Mr. Pukel looking puzzled and slightly stunned . Deyle left the building and walked toward the bus stop . Along the way , he told us that he had to rush back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  another birthday . We asked him how he thought his debut had gone . " Not bad , " he said . " I have to admit that I was pretty excited about it . It 's like performing anywhere , although it seems superior to a dinner theatre I once worked at in New Jersey , where most of the audiences were made up of bridal-shower guests and bowling-league hanqueters . This sort of thing has energy . You take the energy and convert it into excitement during the performance . Delivering a Music-gram is a lot like being onstage , I guess , except that you 're standing in somebody 's hallway . "
