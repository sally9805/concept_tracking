In the countdown for the 1970 America 's Cup in September , midsummer is the time for a series of shakedown races called the Observation Trials . As it happened , some of the most telling observations about this year 's competition could be made right at dockside in Newport , R.I. Late into the night , Naval Architect Olin Stephens was seen tinkering with Valiant , his latest 12-meter design . Near by , Skipper-Designer Charlie Morgan Jr . was hard at work seeking to improve his golden-hulled Heritage . At another slip , the crew of Helmsman Bill Picker 's Intrepid lounged on the sloop 's deck , sporting green-and-white buttons that declared PICKER IS QUICKER . <P> So it seemed . Though the final trials to decide which of the three U.S. boats will defend the cup do not begin until Aug. 18 , the Observation races suggested that Picker and Intrepid are ready to sail off to one of the greatest upsets in America 's Cup history . When the U.S. contenders hit the water this spring , Valiant was the heavy favorite simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 62-year-old designer of four of the last five cup champions . In fact , Stephens ' winning design for the last America 's Cup in 1967 was Intrepid . Now , radically revamped by 29-year-old Designer Britton Chance Jr. , Stephens ' own boat threatens to break the old master 's winning streak . <P> Consistent Superiority . The changes that Chance made on Intrepid-shorter keel , rounder bow , fuller afterbody - have obviously made the white-hulled sloop swifter than ever . What is astonishing is that she may actually be a faster boat than Stephens ' brand-new Valiant . Her first two races around the triangular 24.3-mile course set the pattern for the trials . With Picker at the helm , Intrepid handily defeated the trial horse Weatherly by 3 min. 55 sec. , and then trounced Heritage by the embarrassing margin of 5 min. 17 sec . <P> Valiant , under Skipper Bob McCullough , was the next victim . In their first match , McCullough sloppily cut off Picker 's boat in the preliminary maneuvering and was disqualified . Next time out , Valiant took the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duel ; from then on , Intrepid was never headed , as she repeatedly outfooted Valiant on the windward legs of the course to win by 2 min. 14 sec . Two more times Intrepid and Picker proved quicker-by the combined times of 4 min. 20 sec . Only in the last race was McCullough able to salvage something from the trials by boxing out Intrepid at the gun and going on to win a hard-fought race by 1 min. 50 sec . Final tally : 9 victories , 1 loss for Intrepid ; 4 victories , 6 losses for Valiant . Heritage was just about out of it with a dismal 2-7 record .
