While consumers reeled from violent run-ups in food prices last year , and at one point even organized a nationwide meat boycott , farmers happily harvested record profits . In 1974 , the roles are being reversed : consumers can at last sight some relief from food inflation , and the farmers are talking about-and in some cases organizing-boycotts to keep their incomes from sliding . <P> Wholesale prices received by farmers for some key products have dropped sharply since last winter ( see chart ) ; between February and May , wheat fell from $5.52 a bushel to $3.52 , and corn from $2.76 to $2.45 . Food processors and retailers have by no means passed the full decline along to consumers as yet . In fact , retail food prices overall rose .9% in May , but meat , poultry and egg prices went down . <P> Most cheering to consumers-and worrisome for farmers-is the conversion of last year 's meat shortage into a glut , as a result of heavy production and a continuing reluctance by budgetconscious housewives to buy meat as freely as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as 29% below a year ago , and cattle on the hoof are down 15% . Financially pressed feed-lot operators indeed claim that they are being forced to sell cattle for slaughter for $150 to $200 per animal less than they paid to buy and raise the same steers . <P> Last week frustrated farmers were doing what they could to get prices moving up again . Farmers throughout the Midwest have been withholding their wheat from the market ; they accused the Agriculture Department of depressing prices by issuing harvest forecasts that were too high . George Watts , a poultry industry spokesman , told the House Agriculture Committee that unprofitable prices had forced a large broiler producer to close its Tennessee plant , destroy 800,000 fertilized eggs and smother 300,000 newborn chicks . About 1,000 Western cattlemen threatened to withhold beef from market . The tactics were reminiscent of those that farmers used to protest President Nixon 's second price freeze last summer . <P> Presidential Economics Adviser Kenneth Rush and Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz huddled with cattlemen , meat packers and chain-store operators to explore ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankruptcies in the cattle industry . They urged the retailers to cut prices further to move meat off the shelves and into shopping baskets . Retailers indicated that they would cooperate , and Butz tried some sales promotion of his own . In a deliberately mixed-up metaphorical exhortation to consumers , he exclaimed : " Now is a whale of a good time to stock your home freezers with beef . "
