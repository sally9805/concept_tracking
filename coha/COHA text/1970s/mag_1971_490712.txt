THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IN the weeks since the invasion of Laos , the political world we have lived in for a decade has noiselessly disintegrated , and a new political world has emerged in its place . We can as yet only dimly perceive the shape of this new world , but we do know that certain reassuring limits , restraints , and protective harriers have faded away , leaving us , to our surprise and dismay , face to face with great dangers that were never , perhaps , very far from our minds but that only a month or so ago seemed comfortably distant . And we know that among these dangers is the fundamental , final danger that only our own age has had the misfortune to face . The extent of this abrupt but profound change , which one began to sense only during the early days of the move into Laos , was made clear when the President , in what is unquestionably the most alarming set of remarks made by any President since the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculate on what South Vietnam may decide to do with regard to a possible incursion into North Vietnam in order to defend their national secmitv , " and also said that he was " not going to place any limitation upon the use of air power except , of course , to rule out a rather ridiculous suggesdon that is made from time to time ... that our an power might include the use of tactical nuclear weapons , " and continued , " As you know ... this has been speculated on for a period of five years and I have said for a period of five years that it is not an area where the use of nuclear weapons , in any form , is either needed or would he wise . " The unrestricted use of air power over North Vietnam would , in effect , reverse the decision to end the bombing which President Johnson announced along with his decision ( closely linked ) not to seek a second term of office . An invasion of North Vietnam would enlarge the war beyond any thing ever undertaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong chance of bringing China into the war . If this were to happen , the President 's assertion that the use of nuclear weapons is " not needed " and is " unwise " would not be very consoling , for what is " not needed " and " unwise " in one set of circumstances can come to be considered needed and wise in a different set of circumstances . The President 's remarks force us to look at the war in an entirely new light . For two years , we have been told that what we were witnessing in Lido-China was the last days of a war , and most Americans have seemed to believe it . At the very worst , a few observers have feared a prolonged American presence in South Vietnam . But now a strong possibility has suddenly emerged that the ten years of war in Indo-China , for all their horror , have been only the prologue to a war throughout Southeast Asia  --  a sort of practice session , in which the military and the other bureaucracies and public-relations outfits have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to deceive themselves and the rest of us , and have learned the techniques for brushing aside or overriding the Constitutional restraints that the people , and other branches of the government in our democracy , might try to impose . Some words written by Simone Weil in France in 1933 seem pertinent to this moment . She said that society was dominated by " a vast machine in which men arc continually being caught up and which nobody knows how to con trol ; those who sacrifice themselves for the sake of social progress are like people who try to grasp the wheels and clutch at the transmission belts in a vain effort to stop the machine . They are crushed in their turn . " As we look to the future , it now seems possible that the war may prove to have been the assembly area for a vast machine whose first , and perhaps final , act might he to provoke a war with China . The nature of this machine has become clear during its ten years of development in Indo-China . The machine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion . Unlike many institutions , it has a natural tendency not to be passive and inert but to move and gather momentum . The difficulty is not in setting it in motion  --  as with , say , the judicial system  --  hut in getting it to stop . The machine has no restraints within itself and can he restrained only by outside forces , such as the elected officials of government . It is the machine 's nature to make war . If the outside-restraining forces collapse , it will make war the way a dog harks . It is a strain for the machine not to make war . This characteristic can he detected in the remark of an official to the effect that a recent decision to expand the bombing of North Vietnam constituted a more " permissive " policy . The machine rejects all defined purposes . When it uses language , it uses language exclusively as a weapon . Ultimately , it could operate much more smoothly if it did n't have to issue any explanations or justifications at all . For example , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war was said to be the " containment " of China , but now it is precisely our expansion of the war that threatens to draw the Chinese beyond their horde rs , This explanation of purpose now works against the machine 's own expansion , and has become an irritating impediment , which the machine casts aside . The machine requires simplicity . The democratic system of government , with its checks and hal30 FEBRUARY 2 7 $ 19 71 antes , with its public opinion ( which costs so much to manipulate ) , with its demonstrations and its annoyingly skeptical , questioning press and Congress , is too complicated for it . , nd the machine 's greatest enemy is the most complicated thing of all  --  human society itself . Faithful tilways to its internal laws of growth and attentive always to its own propaganda , the machine is constructed to disregard the outside world altogether . But human society  --  seeminglti such a soft , disorganized , defenseless thing  --  tenaciously sets up endless obstacles to the machine . It is human society that fouls up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again after the around-theclock shelling and bombing , that disrupts the game plans , and that refuses to bend to the violence Sometimes the only way to simplify things enough is to destroy the society altogether . In Indo-China , the machine has made war on Indo-Chinese society from the start . It has efficiently torn the society apart as part of its game plan for the war . Now it appears that those who " control " the machine are undertaking further simplifications . There is the reported plan to move millions of people from the northern provinces of South Vietnam to the southern provinces ; one reason for the invasions of Cambodia and Laos is surely that the military thinks the war will he simpler to fight there , away from the hostile civilian population of South Viet- 0 ? nam ; and one temptation to invade North Vietnam is that die machine might then be able to fight a highly recognizable enemy  --  namely , the Chinese Army . And , finally , the machine 's tendency to create simplicity through violence , and its tendency to reject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is moving unswervingly toward the ultimate simplification . The question before us now is whether there is any force in the country that is able or  --  what is more to the point  --  willing to oppose such a machine as this . Unfortunately , as was recently noted in these pages , the people in Congress and in the country as a whole who have protested past escalations of the war have remained comparatively silent and inactive during this most recent and most grave escalation . In fact , the active , vigorous people in Edo-China and the silent , discouraged people at home are all , in different ways , under the sway of violence , th gong ) being intoxicated by it and the other stunned . Why , at this most dangerous hour since the beginning of the Indo-China war , is the country so quiet ? When events seem to move unexpectedly and decisively against one , there is always a temptation to detach oneself and become a spectator , or simply to sleep . There is a temptation to endow the machine with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action itself is numbed , and even victims of the machine are capably of nothing more than a feeling of admiration for its great power as it rolls over them . There is actually a paradoxical tinge of smugness in this piece of self-deception , inasmuch as one feels that it has taken a literally omnipotent force to crush such a fighter as oneself . Yet there is some-thing more to he said about the machine and men . Simone Weil went on to write , " The helplessness which one feels at a given mo-ment  --  a helplessness which one should never consider total  --  neither excuses one from re-maining true to oneself nor justifies surrender to the enemy , what-ever disguise the enemy assumes . And whether it calls itself Fascism , democracy , or the dictator-ship of the proletariat , the supreme en-emy remains the administrative ap-paratus , he it civil or military . The true enemy is not the one in front of us , who is our enemy only insofar as he is the enemy of our brothers : the true enemy is the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In no mat-ter what circumstances , the worst be-trayal is to consent to subordinate one-self to this administrative apparatus , and , in its service , to destroy , in oneself and in others , alI true human values . " John W. Gardner THE Ninety-second Congress has become the first in sixty years to ease , even slightly , the rigid seniority system of that body , which concentrates power in the hands of aged , rural , Southern , often arch-conservative members . A fair share of credit for the small victory must go to a brand-new citizens ' lobby , whose amateur members and professional staff bombarded Congress with messages encouraging the move . Barely six months ago , John W. Gardner , a liberal Republican who was then chairman of the Urban Coalition and who before . that  --  until he quietly resigned because of the Vietnam war  --  had been President Johnson 's Secretary of Health , Education , and Welfare , sent out to a select mailing list a letter that began , " I would like to ask you to join me in forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuilding this nation . It will he known as Common Cause . It will not he a third party but a third force in American life , deriving its strength from a common desire to solve the nation 's problems and revitalize its institutions of government . " The issues Mr. Gardner , as chairman of Common Cause , set forth  --  ending the Vietnam war quickly , and giving the problems of poverty and race in the United States the highest priorities on a list that called for new solutions in housing , employment , education , health , consumer protection , environmental protection , family planning , law enforcement , and the administration of justice  --  evidently hit home , indicating that at least a part of the public recognized a need for what had all too regularly been called " a reordering of national priorities , " but had found no place to raise its voice effectively . Membership in Common Cause had been set at fifteen dollars a year , to assure its financial independence of large contributors pleading for special interests , and the immediate response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts had predicted . The dues-paying membership is now well over the hundred-thousand mark and increasing briskly . We have long been acquainted with John Gardner 's ' Washington reputation for clear thinking , but we met him for the first time only recently , when he was in New York on business , and we had a talk with him at a midtown office . We found him to be a tall , trim man of fifty-eight with a Roman profile . " There is a strong current of impatience running in this country with institutions that are n't doing their job , " he told us almost at once . " What has been borne in on me during my years in Washington is that we are n't going to solve any of our problems with the existing machinery . It is n't that the cities ca n't serve the blacks ; they ca n't serve the whites , either . You look at a state legislature and you 're astonished that the public business gets done at all . What was frightening about the Penn Central collapse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't deliver the freight , much less the people . I think of France at the start of the Second World War , the structure so weakened by political and social decay that what fell was not a great nation but a house of cards . Common Cause has a cluster of issues around which men of good will can rally , but our emphasis is on going to the heart of the system 's functioning  --  on revitalizing our institutions . It 's peculiarly the issues of structure and process that until now have not had a constituency . Anybody can organize a group to speak out against hunger ; Common Cause is trying to get the point across , clearly and emphatically , that questions of hunger wo n't be solved as long as a septuagenarian Texan named W. R. Prage , who is more concerned with subsidizing farmers than with feeding children , is chairman of the House Agriculture Committee . We Americans have woven a tight web of institutions that imprison us , limit our decision and scope . To imagine that enlightened conversation will change things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We knew that Mr. Gardner had come out of the academic community  --  a Californian , he holds an A.B . and an M.A. from Stanford and a Ph.D . from the University of California , and he taught psychology for some years  --  and we asked him if he had always preferred action to enlightened conversation . " No , I 'm a slow learner , " he said , with a smile . " I started out as the most academic of academics  --  the kind of faculty member who never even bothers to attend faculty meetings . An inveterate reader and strident . Then came the Second World War , and I never went hack to teaching ; I guess I had had enough of fine gills ' colleges in sylvan glens . " During the war , Gardner joined the Marines and was attached to the O.S.S. in Washington , Italy , And Austria . After his discharge , as a captain , he joined the Carnegie Corporation of New York , and eventually became president of that and , concurrently , of the Carnegie Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in foundation work , in the conviction that if you understood a problem well enough and could communicate that understanding , somehow the world would be better . I believed in education in the broadest , deepest sense . Only when I went to H.E.W . and then the Urban Coalition Action Council did I come to understand how much could be accomplished by activist groups with a shared agenda  --  especially when they avoid the deadly game of organizational vanity . " ? A-7 12 asked Mr. Gardner to reply to the charge that movements like Common Cause are naive and ineffectual . " There has always been this folk cynicism about citizens ' movements , but from Populism on they have been tough political realities , " he said . " The peace nuivement , the child-labor laws , conservation , family planning , prohibition and its repeal  --  none of these arrived through established political channels . ' What is lacking is never the power but the professional cutting edge . That can he supplied by this marvellous new instrument of puhlic-interest litigation and by a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement has to be sloppy . We have a professional staff of thirteen , in addition to clerical help , and use all the tools of the successful lobbyist . A young man who has been a leading figure in many of the activist movements of recent years hung around our shop for four days recently . When he left , he said , You know what thrills me about this place ? It 's so damn professional . ' He had seen enthusiasm ebb time and again as the public 's attention shifted from issue to issue . We 're set up against that inevitable ebb and flow . We will be here , speaking out always for the public interest . " ?

Concepts THERE will he only three more flights to the moon in the Apollo series , and , accordingly , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is already eying the next big event in the manned-spacecraft program  --  a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the earth late in the decade . ( Recenth , a space expert suggested on the Op . Ed. page of the Times that we may all be living in space stations someday . ) A small version of NASA 's space station , the Skylab , will go into orbit in 1974 , but the Skylab is to the space station what Quonset but is to the Astrodome . Twenty men may he living in the big space station for six months at a time . So far , no man has ever spent such A long period in space , or has ever been in a spacecraft so large that he could float about inside it without coming anywhere near a wall . Therefore , NASA asked the Grumman Aerospace Corporation , in Bethpage , Long Island , to do two studies : one on how astronauts who are in space for long periods can keep themselves neat and clean ; the other on the best ways of moving about inside a big space station and how to stay still in a weightless environment long enough to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The space station that NASA asked Grumman to investigate living in ( it does not necessarily resemble the space station that NASA wants to orbit before 1980 ) looks like a propeller two hundred feet across . It has four one-hundred-foot arms , each of them a shaft sixty feet lung ending in a cylinder forty feet long and thirty-three feet in diameter . The cylinders , which will be divided into five decks , are the biggest interior spaces the astronauts will have to worry about . Like a propeller , the space station will revolve  --  at a stately four revolutions per minute  --  and the resulting centrifugal force will create a sort of reverse gravity in the four cylinders , with the " down " direction being the outward one . The gravity situation will he confusing in other ways , too , for at the center of the space station the astronauts will be weightless , and as they move out along the arms their weight will increase , reaching a maximum of seven-tenths of their weight on earth . The space station will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Grumman engineers say that the designers of the space station will have to take the axis of the spin into consideration in planning the layout of furniture and of consoles , for if an astronaut were made to move his head repeatedly in the wrong direction in relation to the spin , lie could easily get spacesick . Two of the Grumman pilots who worked on the studies  --  Gerry Gibbons and Richard Bassano  --  said that the hardest part of the job was n't so much solving problems as thinking up what the problems would be . " We just had to let our minds run wild , " Gibbons said . The result of this activity was tvvi fat hooks  --  a light-green one and a dark-blue one  --  full of what Grumman engineers cal " concepts . " Before the project started , NASA laid clown certain rules , such as that all concepts should be simple and safe  --  a rule that compelled the engineers to eliminate some of their more extravagant concepts for moving about in the relatively weightless areas of the space station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could swim through the air . The idea was discarded because each flipper would have had to he as big as a large kite . Another idea the engineers tossed out before submitting the reports was to waft the astronauts Lip and down the long arms of the space station on constant streams of air . Like the flippers , the fans required to keep the air moving would be prohibitively big . Even so , an astronaut undertaking Long-distance travel within the space station may have a choice of three concepts  --  a moving ladder , a moving handrail , and an elevator . The elevator  --  an open platform that would travel from the far end of a cylinder up through the arm and end at the hub , where , in a sort of lobby , an astronaut could change elevators to go out another arm  --  would have no counterweight , for when the elevator was at the end of one of the arms a counterweight at the huh would be weightless . The moving handrail would be mounted on a track running the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hold on to with one hand , would travel along the track like an electric ear , and when he pressed hishe a button with / ; thumb , / would be whisked away . The moving ladder would he a sort of endless chain , with places for the astronaut 's hands and feet . The designers would have to make sure the ladder was facing the right way in relation to the space station 's spin , because otherwise the Coriolis force  --  an effect of rotation that on earth causes phenomena like water swirling as it goes down a drain  --  would tend to sweep the astronaut off . In space , it is a lot easier for an astronaut to move than it is for him to stay put . Grumman studied a variety of tethers that would anchor a man at the waist , but the best way to anchor a man has always been by his feet . One way of doing this would be to have pairs of shoes fastened to the floor at strategic spots ( Grumman calls this the Dutch Shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to alight for a while . The difficulty with " When 1 said that three 's ( 7 crowd , I had no idea he 'd be such a brick about if . " ? ? this arrangement is that the astronaut could stand only where the shoes were ; it would he much better , the Grumman engineers point out , if the astronaut could 7crar shoes that would allow him to stand anyplace . In the Skylab , the astronauts will he wearing shoes with triangular knobs in the soles , and the floor will he a grid of triangular openings into which the knobs can lock . The Grumman engineers feel that this arrangement , which is called the Astrogrid , would make the big space station look like a prison ; they put forward a concept of their own , called Suction Shoes . Each shoe would have a big suction cup embedded in the sole , so that an astronaut settling on a smooth floor would only have to twist his feet for the suction cups to hold him down , When he- twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be released . The Grumman people looked into using magnetic shoes , but discarded the idea , because the shoes could he used only on an iron floor , which would he impractically heavy far the space station . They also considered coyering both the floor and the soles of the shoes with Velcro , the material that clings to itself by microscopic hooks in its fibres , but since Velcro , which holds very well against any vertical pull , gives way when it is peeled sidewise , they found that an astronaut an Velcro shoes would conic unhooked if he leaned over . The engineers recommend placing a variety of handgrips and railings throughout the spacecraft , and they have also invented a portable liandgrip -- an expandable rod that an astronaut could carry around . and jam into any nook or cranny ( assuming then . are nooks and crannies in a space station ) , tighten into place , and cling to . With three of the portable handrails , an astronaut could make himself a chair iassurning he could find a narrow enough nook that he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet under a second , and placing the third in front of his waist , as though he were sitting on a rail fence . In weightlessness , seats do n't nerd to be deep and comfortable all they are required to do is to hold an astronaut down . The biggest chair in the space motion would be a sort of inner tube called the Inflatable Mid-Torso Restraint , which would be attached to a pole set into the floor , and which the astronaut would slip around his middle and then inflate to hold him snugly . This would be the chair for an astronaut to relax and read a hook in , and when he had to get hack to work , he would he likely to put the book down nn a concept culled the Electrostatic Ae rod ) mimic Drag Work Table .
