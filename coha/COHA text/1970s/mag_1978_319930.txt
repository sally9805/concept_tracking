The Polish Pope <P> To the Editors : <P> Pope John Paul II Oct. 30 is going to be a sensational Pope . He seems to be sure of himself . The Cardinals made an excellent choice . He 's just like the man next door , except he just happens to be a Pope . <P> Terri Freedman <P> Camarilla , Calif . <P> It should come as no surprise to anyone that a Polish Pope has been elected . In the Christian society , Poland has always represented the suffering Christ . To have been sold down the river many times ( once by an American President ) and not have lost faith is indeed miraculous . That the Vicar of Christ should come from these people is merely a reaffirmation of the presence of the Holy Spirit . <P> Katherine Bieluck <P> New York City <P> As a Catholic whose faith has been eroded during the past couple of years by hypocrites in habits and materialists in collars , I can only hope Pope John Paul II will bring cohesiveness to the divided laity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth-control issue , particularly in countries where the production of life is the prevention of life . <P> Bernadette Zimmerman Spartanburg , S.C . <P> At this moment four of the most prominent men in the fields of religion ( John Paul II ) , politics ( Zbigniew Brzezinski and Menachem Begin ) and literature ( Isaac Bashevis Singer ) are Polish-born . Hurray for Poland ! <P> Barbara Schenkel Melbourne <P> Women and War <P> I loved your article about women in the military Oct. 30 . Wow , if I were only 30 years younger . I served in the WASP during World War II . Guess what ? I could pick up 100 lbs . even when six months pregnant . And I 'm 5 ft. 6 in. and weigh 120 lbs . So do n't tell me women ca n't do the labor . I hope all goes well with the lady military . <P> Lulie Robinette <P> Weston , Conn . <P> Instead of your article being called " Women May Yet Save the Army , " it should be entitled " How Can the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Eugene , Ore . <P> Nothing I saw the troops or their officers do during the time I served in Viet Nam could not have been done by a 100-lb. female . The bleeding is the only hard part , and it requires no special skill . <P> William D. Watson <P> Denver <P> The only objection I have to a military composed of 10% women by 1983 is that since women are unproved in combat , a potential enemy may view them as an American weakness . Foreign military officers I have spoken to tend to believe the U.S. is using its women in combat roles because without the draft it is unable to " man " its ranks . <P> Jim Bob Green <P> Plainview , Texas <P> When the real shooting starts , are the folks on the home front prepared to be told of gal grunts and female flyers coming home in pine boxes ? Unless Americans can handle that , all the peacetime combat training in the world wo n't be worth a spent bullet , because the G.I. Janes are going to stay home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democracy
