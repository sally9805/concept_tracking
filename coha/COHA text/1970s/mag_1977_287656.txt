They are the last American ground forces on the Asian mainland . Manning guard posts along the Uijongbu Corridor , 14,000 G.I.s of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division stand astride the traditional invasion route from northern Korea to Seoul . For nearly 25 years , the presence of the 2nd Division along the Demilitarized Zone has been visible proof of America 's commitment to defend the Seoul government against renewed aggression from the north . But the division 's days in South Korea are numbered ; President Carter has decided to withdraw the 2nd , along with its 17,700 support troops , by 1982 . That decision has already cost one U.S. Army general his job , triggered a congressional hearing and set off a debate that raged last week in military circles , in Seoul and in other Asian capitals , where there are tremors of concern about Carter 's foreign policy ( see following story ) . <P> South Korean President Park Chung Hee was formally notified of U.S. plans for the troop withdrawal last week by Philip Habib , Under Secretary of State for Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joint Chiefs of Staff . During a three-hour session in the Blue House , the presidential mansion in central Seoul , Park took the news-by then hardly a surprise-calmly and thanked his visitors for all the U.S. has done for his country . He was aware , Park said , that the G.I.s could not remain in Korea forever . <P> Solemn Commitment . During last year 's campaign , Carter had pledged that he would gradually pull all U.S. ground forces out of Korea . After his inauguration , the President ordered studies of how best to accomplish this goal . When questioned about that decision at his Washington press conference last week , Carter explained : " The time has come for a very careful , very orderly withdrawal over a period of four or five years . " He stressed that the U.S. would leave behind " adequate intelligence forces , observation forces , air forces , naval forces and a firm open commitment to our defense treaty . " For these reasons , Carter insisted , " there need not be any doubt about potential adversaries concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to South Korea Richard Sneider in an interview with TIME : " We will not do anything to disturb the military balance or weaken the security of South Korea . This is a very solemn commitment . " <P> The troop withdrawal is a reaffirmation of the so-called Nixon Doctrine , by which the U.S. promises continued support of its allies but expects them to do their own fighting on the ground . In keeping with this principle , the U.S. 7th Division was withdrawn from South Korea in 1970-71 . By ordering the 2nd Division home , Carter probably feels he has reduced the risk that the U.S. will suddenly find itself embroiled in another Asian land war-a political disaster for any President .
