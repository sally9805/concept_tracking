Not once had the U.S. exercised its veto in the United Nations Security Council . Though the Soviet Union has voted " nyet " 105 times , it was implicit American policy to use the veto only in grave emergencies . <P> Thus it was curious that the U.S. last week cast its first U.N . veto against a resolution , supported by a majority of the Security Council , that would have condemned Britain for refusing to use military force to unseat the white minority government of Rhodesia . <P> The resolution was probably unwise ; if Britain had indeed gone into Rhodesia with troops , some U.N . members might have made a reverse charge of outside interference . Also , Britain herself vetoed the resolution , making U.S. rejection unnecessary . The Administration has already closed the U.S. consulate in Rhodesia and has committed itself to the principle of black majority rule there . But in the Security Council , the U.S. gave an impression that it was retreating a step or two from the principle of black African self-government . In any case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obstructionist 's tool , the veto .
