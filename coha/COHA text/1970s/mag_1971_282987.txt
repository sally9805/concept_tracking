RIDING THE STORM : 1956-1959 by Harold Macmillan . 786 pages . Harper &; Row . $15 . <P> Faithful readers who have already followed Supermac through three volumes of adventures will find him this time at the peak of his powers . The U.S. has let Britain down at Suez . Anthony Eden has quit . But Harold , as Her Majesty 's Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury , moves in to rebuild the Anglo-American alliance on the basis of his old friendship with Dwight Eisenhower . He also pilots the ship of state through the storms of crisis in Lebanon , an incipient trade war in Europe , a Gaullist coup in France . Soviet ultimatums about Berlin , and assorted parliamentary pothers in Britain . <P> Diplomatic Switch . Some deck passengers will sail with Macmillan to the very end . Others will drop off at Port Said ( page 179 ) , after Macmillan has taken them through the Suez adventure . Even there they may depart dissatisfied . For Macmillan , one of the Cabinet few who probably knew all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group known cynically as the Suez " Pretext Committee " ) , chooses not to tell all . Perhaps inhibited by Britain 's 30-year rule on state secrets , Macmillan sticks with the official version that Britain and France landed troops only to separate Israeli and Egyptian combatants . No such inhibitions , however , apply to Macmillan 's version of the U.S. role at Suez . John Foster Dulles comes off in this book almost as badly as Gamal Abdel Nasser . <P> For Macmillan . the Egyptian President was a sort of South Shore Mussolini . " In dealing with him Nasser , every display of timidity or weakness was seized upon and exploited . No action , however generous or fairminded , could reap any reward . " As for Dulles , his " vanity more than equalled his talents . " At first Dulles told Britain that after seizing the canal , Nasser must be made to " disgorge what he was attempting to swallow . " Then the " strange uncertainty of Dulles ' own character and the light rein with which the President chose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . By Macmillan 's count , Dulles switched signals at least three times upon taking the canal issue to the TJ.N . He dreamed up the 18-nation Suez Canal Users Association but sabotaged it by admitting publicly that the users would probably go around the Cape rather than shoot their way through the canal . <P> When the U.K. and France acted , Dulles erupted in ' " hostility amounting almost to frenzy . There may have been other reasons . Perhaps the grim disease which was later to prove mortal had affected his psychological and intellectual equilibrium . Perhaps the spectre of Soviet Russia , now armed with the terrible nuclear weapon , had begun to haunt his dreams . He clearly lost his temper ; he may also have lost his nerve . In any event , we and our French allies were now to face an attack , skillfully devised and powerfully executed , in which the protagonists were the Russian and American Governments , acting together in unnatural coalition .
