" I 'm not homesick for the States or bored with this life . Costa Rica is a lovely country . Great weather , is n't it ? " <P> <P> The speaker is Financier Robert Lee Vesco , who last week gave a rare telephone interview to TIME Correspondent Bernard Diederich . His sentiments are understandable : if the U.S. can get him extradited from Costa Rica , to which he fled in 1972 , he will face trial on four indictments . The latest , returned in mid-January , charges Vesco and six associates with selling stocks held by mutual funds that were managed by I.O.S. Ltd. - the investment complex once controlled by Bernard Cornfeld-and then investing more than $100 million of the proceeds " for their own use and benefit " in corporations they controlled . Some $60 million allegedly went into Inter-American Capital , a Costa Rican-based corporation . <P> It so happens that $60 million is the most common estimate of how much money Vesco has pumped into the Costa Rican economy , most of it through the purchase of government bonds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reputed to have invested heavily in industry , agriculture and real estate and to own the tallest office building in the capital city of San Jos , along with various restaurants , a coffee plantation and interests in newspapers and radio-TV stations . He is known to have sunk more than $2 million into a holding company called San Cristbal S.A. , a chief interest of Former President Jos ( " Pepe " ) Figueres , a popular figure who is Vesco 's leading backer in Costa Rica . <P> The money has not bought Vesco universal popularity . Last December he served as honorary president of a fiesta in Heredia , a provincial capital . But after the newspaper Excelsior ( which Vesco is rumored to own ) ran pictures of the financier crowning the winner of a beauty contest , the town fathers rebuked the fiesta commission for honoring the infamous exile , and two other dailies published expressions of moralistic indignation from educators and public officials . Vesco 's presence is frequently denounced by politicians in opposition to the government of Figueres ' successor , Daniel Oduber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1962 , has accused the government on television of granting special favors to Vesco and his associates and enlisting them to reap windfall profits in a deal with Costa Rica 's national petroleum refinery . <P> But many Costa Ricans feel Vesco has become too important to the country 's tiny economy to be kicked out . " To extradite him , " sighs an opposition politician , " would mean the extradition of his money too . " Indeed , in 1974 , under Figueres , Costa Rica rewrote its extradition law to allow the government to veto an extradition demand before it ever reaches the courts . That new statute is popularly known as the " Vesco law . "
