txt One of the " key pressures " that has been pushing up wholesale and retail prices in the U.S. is weakening , giving rise to hope that consumer inflation may wane in the last auarter of 11174 That key pressure , according to Irwin Kellner , vice-president and economist of Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York , is the price of raw materials " at their earliest stage of processing . " Metals " as they come out of the ground , " textiles and fibers , hides and leather , says Mr. Kellner , are " flattening " in price . So far this flattening has not reached down to later processing stages , so that industrial prices ? of steel , copper , aluminum , and many other commodities ? still are climbing sharply at the wholesale level . Industrial prices , notes the U.S. Department of Labor , rose 2.3 percent in April , somewhat lower than the 2.9 percent recorded in March . This foretells further upsurges in retail prices in the months Just ahead , experts agree , as the higher costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford Motor Company , citing " unprecedented " cost increases ? including an industry-wide boost in the price of steel ? has announced higher prices for all 1974 models , averaging $183 per vehicle . This follows earlier price hikes by Chrysler . General Motors is expected to follow suit , as the higher price of steel , other materials , and labor inflates manufacturing costs . John T. Dunlop , director of the Cost of Living Council , charged Ford with violating its commitment , made last December , not to raise prices further during the 1974 model year . // *U.S. inflation may be easing // Dr. Dunlop , conscious that wage and price controls would expire April 30 , had sought to smooth out the post-controls price bulge , by getting pledges from business leaders not to raise prices unduly . Ford officials replied that their price action was " totally cost justified " and hence in line with the commitment the firm had given to Dr. Dunlop . The Ford and Chrysler price hikes are symptomatic of a general upward spiral of prices that has taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , how- ever , that the current flattening of raw material prices at the point of origin should be reflected later in more stable prices all along the processing and retail chain . The bank economist foresees retail prices rising at a 6 percent clip in the last quarter of 1974 , compared to the soaring 14.5 percent rate chalked up so far this year . Overall , reports the Department of Labor , the wholesale price index in April rose 0.7 percent , compared to cimbs of 1.3 percent in March , 1.2 percent in February , and a whopping 3.1 percent in January .
