txt In the midst of grave folly last week , South Africa 's Prime Minister Vorster raised some serious questions . we nwe him  --  and ourselves  --  the answers . " We are not ? governed from overseas , " Mr. Vorster insisted to a cheering election rally . In other words , what gives Americans the right to react with horror and threat to his suppression of all major black political leaders and organizations ? The threat of a retaliatory change in American policy , he added , " is none of my business whatsoever . " In other words , why should he care what the United States thinks or does ? And finally a theme of mocking irony about a Western " double standard " ; he could do what he wanted without protest if he were black instead of white . In other words , given all the injustice around the world why condemn South Africa with such special vehemence ? The answer to the first question is that we are all , indeed , governed from overseas . Much of mankind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of values that transcends not only national frontiers but also social systems and stages of development . A century ago , Americans could still debate the rules by which they might consign blacks to second-class citizenship . Today , obedient to the transcendent values of an interconnected civilization , they may not . South Africa belongs to that same civilization ; indeed , at other moments , Mr. Vorster has been fast to proclaim his membership in It to seek protection against his Communist phantoms . We accumulate his gold ; he punches our computers and drinks our soda . We worship in the same Bible . In the realms of ideology we are each other 's keepers . We govern a common fate . Why , more concretely , should he care what we do ? Because his economy , Europe 's and ours are interlocked . Even now American campuses seethe with demands that the universities withdraw their investments from corporations doing business in his country . Rich and strong , South Africa could injure us as we would injure it , but not remotely in comparable ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country 's huge black majority for decades more , but not forever ; and the time left for peaceful change will rapidly shrink if the last remnants of legitimacy are withdrawn from its Government by other nations . As for injustices elsewhere , they are rampant . Tyranny , by blacks as well as whites , discredits other nations . Violence and economic deprivation are tolerated too much in our own land . But racism stands condemned as intolerable . Official racism that seeks to root political power in the doctrine of the permanent inferiority of men and women of a different color is the evil inheritance of white men everywhere and they are pledged to expunge it . Official racism in a nation so wealthy and advanced in almost every other respect has become unforgivable . We Americans say again that there is time for peaceful change in South Africa if blacks are invited to the table at which the nation 's destiny is mapped . It is our business to say it , and Mr. Vorster 's obligation to his nation and ours to listen . We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the direction . We shall suffer together if we fail .
