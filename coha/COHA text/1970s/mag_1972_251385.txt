GEORGE S. KAUFMAN : AN INTIMATE PORTRAIT by HOWARD TEICHMANN 371 pages . Atheneum. $10 . <P> The large-caliber wisecrack , like the horse pistol , is part of America 's past . As the Norman Mailer-Germaine Greer exchange indicated recently , the snub-nosed innuendo aimed below the belt is today 's favored weapon . When quips were quips even a President of the United States could get them off . Remember the British diplomat who told Lincoln that " English gentlemen never black their own boots " ? Lincoln looked up from buffing his own and replied , " Whose boots do you black ? " <P> The humor of George S. Kaufman was very much in that laconic , debunking vein . In fact , Kaufman , a lanky ribbon salesman from Pittsburgh who became the most successful Broadway playwright of his time , attended costume balls as the 16th President . In later years , possibly touchy about being mistaken for Raymond Massey , he remarked that the actor would not be satisfied until he was assassinated . <P> One simply could not make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like so much else , has been overwhelmed by events . A witticism has its moments ; a context , a gesture , a silence present themselves and move on . So it is not too disappointing to find that many of Kaufman 's best lines have gone flat , despite Howard Teichmann 's efforts to freshen them . In 1952 Teichmann collaborated with Kaufman in the writing of one of Kaufman 's last plays , The Solid Gold Cadillac . He was late in a line of distinguished collaborators who included Marc Connelly , Edna Ferber and Moss Hart . Teichmann approaches his subject with enormous respect . He usually addressed Kaufman as " Mr. Kaufman . " For Kaufman was the professional professional , and a sleepless craftsman who believed that plays were not written but rewritten . <P> How do his plays hold up ? It is difficult to tell from reading them . The right actors , stage business and timing are essential to their success . In Kaufman 's offstage humor there is the persistent delight of his famous pun , " One man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also an unleavened cruelty . After one of Dorothy Parker 's unsuccessful suicide attempts , he remarked , " Dorothy , you 've got to be careful . Next time you might hurt yourself . " <P> The fear of death and disease often underlay the Kaufman style . Son of an overprotective mother whose first boy died in infancy , Kaufman grew up to be a devout hypochondriac . He ate oatmeal nearly every day of his life ; he hated casual human contact and touching doorknobs . One of his many mistresses recalls that when she once innocently tasted his soup in a restaurant , Kaufman promptly ordered another bowl . When she asked him how he could kiss her , Kaufman replied , " Well , Miss S. , your tasting my soup was one kind of risk . My kissing you was another . Let 's concentrate on the second . " <P> By that time , Kaufman was a rich , famous author-collaborator of more than two dozen comedies and musicals , including You Ca n't Take It With You , Of Thee I Sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playwright and director spanned nearly 40 years , and his influence was enormous . Brooks Atkinson credited Kaufman with making the wisecrack part of our language . Groucho Marx claimed that " Kaufman gave me the walk and the talk . "
