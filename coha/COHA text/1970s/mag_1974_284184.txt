MIDDLE EAST / COVER STORY <P> Trim in his gray Finnish army uniform , General Ensio Siilasvuo inspected representatives of five nations facing him in Geneva 's Palais des Nations last week . Groping for nonmilitary words that would truly express the emotion of the moment , the commander of the United Nations peace-keeping forces told them that they were taking " a giant and courageous step " that heralded " a new era of trust , justice and peace in the Middle East . " <P> With that , Siilasvuo invited representatives of Israel and Syria to sign the disengagement agreement between their countries that U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had successfully negotiated during a month of difficult and dramatic shuttle diplomacy . Major General Herzl Shafir signed immediately for Israel . Syrian Brigadier Adnanwajih Tayara , presumably because his government was still uneasy about dealing with an enemy of 26 years , would sign only after newsmen had been cleared from a gallery overlooking the chamber . <P> The ceremony did indeed symbolize a giant step . As Siilasvuo reminded the signatories and the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal more remains to be done . " But remarkable achievements had already been scored-first an Egyptian-Israeli disengagement , next a more complicated Syrian-Israel pullback . The two agreements , limited though they were , made it possible for the first time in years to envision a lasting peace settlement in the Middle East . Both represented extraordinary accomplishments for Kissinger himself , who had once more demonstrated the effectiveness of his unique brand of personal diplomacy . If the settlements seemed to prove Kissinger 's apparent indispensability , they also showed-to the obvious discomfiture of the Soviet Union-that the U.S. had become essential to the shaping of a border peace agreement . <P> Silent Guns . The words of Kissinger 's remarkable disengagement deal between Israel and Syria were quickly translated into heartening action last week . On the Golan Heights , where 1,200 artillery duels have been waged since the end of the October war , the big guns fell silent . According to a Syrian military communique , " all fighting stopped at 2:15 p.m . " ( Damascus time ) - exactly half an hour after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its soldiers had been killed in the final round of shooting and two others injured . <P> Next day , International Red Cross representatives began the first big step decreed by the agreement , an exchange of Syrian and Israeli prisoners of war . Israel held a total of 408 P.O.W.s , including a handful of Iraqis and Moroccans who had been captured last fall while fighting on the Syrian front . The Syrians had 65 Israeli soldiers and airmen , and three Druze civilians . Carefully obeying terms of the agreement , each side first released wounded prisoners - 12 Israelis , 25 Syrians and one Moroccan-for repatriation ; after that , the able were to be freed . Last to be returned , within ten days after the signing , were bodies of the military dead .
