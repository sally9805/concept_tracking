txt With only a 10-day supply of residual oil on hand to generate electricity , instead of a normal 25-day supply , the Consolidated Edison Company yesterday put into effect a 5 per cent round-the-clock , seven-day-a week voltage reduction . The move for 2.9 million customers in New York City and Westchester County replaced a 3 per cent reduction that had been ordered statewide Dec. 24 . The utility said that the new reduction should have no significant impact on service , . although " it might take a minute longer to make toast in the morning and motors might run a bit slower . " The action was even more drastic than the 5 per cent voltage cuts put into effect in November in New England in the face of the energy shortage , which had provided for daily reductions from 4 to 8 P.M. Con Edison also set up a meeting in Washington for this afternoon to ask the Federal Energy Office for an immediate diversion of 1.7 million barrels of residual oil from other parts of the country . Residual oil is the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , schools and large apartment buildings , in contrast ' to the lighter-grade heating oil used in homes . In the same session , Con Edison will renew efforts to get permission to burn coal at its million-kilowatt Big Allis generator in Ravenswood , Queens , an oil-fueled installation that has been idle since a fire last Dec. 6 . The 1.6 million barrels , rep- resenting the currently available 10-day systemwide supply , were described by Joseph C. Swidler , chairman of the State Public Service Commission , in a report to Governor Wilson as " a dangerously low level of reserves . " . Mr. Swidler , in , an interview from Albany , decried Federal failure to act since Dec. 17 on an application Con Edison made at that time for an allocation of residual oil . " If they 're not going to permit that , ' he said , " then they should permit Con Edison to burn coal at Ravenswood and at the 16 other plants throughout the East that E.P.A . the Federal Environmental Protection Agency turned down . " Beame Endorses Proposal He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximize production " of residual oil and the lighter home heating oils , which would mean reducing the output of gasoline ? " and in that situation , gasoline rationing becomes essential , " he added . In its announcement yesterday , Con Edison also appealed to its 2,500 customers in Manhattan , mostly large commercial and residential buildings , to reduce their space heating temperatures to 65 degrees . Earlier pleas had been for 68- , degree maximums . It also urged conserving of electricity , Mayor Beame endorsed this appeal , and directed city agencies to redouble efforts to save electricity , which , he said , had been reduced by 15 per cent in some municipal departments . " Severe weather conditions during this past week are causing the reduction of fuel oil inventories at a more rapid rate , " Mayor Beame added . Con Edison also called on the other six major utilities in the New York Power Pool for help . In Guilderland , near Albany , the agency responded that it had ordered rescheduling of maintenance of transmission lines so that the largest possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 5 per cent voltage reduction and hoped-for consumer savings might lessen need for residual oil by about 9,000 barrels a day , Bertram Schwartz , Con Edison vice president for system planning and fuel supply , estimated . " Our most optimistic estimate , " he said , " assuming that our four suppliers deliver in January what they promised , is that by the end of the month , our reserve would be less than seven days " supply . " Permission to burn coal at Ravenswood , as well as at Arthur Kill in Staten Island for which Federal Environmental Protection Agency permission was granted Dec 13 , would result in savings equivalent to 25,000 barrels of residual oil a day , - Mr . Schwartz said . However , Mr. Schwartz said : " The delay in getting a decision on coal-burning is haunting us . As we predicted back in November when we sought a speedy resolution of this issue , coal supplies have become tight . " The winter season is affecting mine production , the market has become extremely competitive , and deliveries are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 160,000 tons of coal ordered for shipment through January , he said only 8,000 had been delivered , with less than 35,000 more expected by the end of the month . The unit at Arthur Kill , generating 500,000 kilowatts , and Ravenswood 's Big Allis are each expected to require a little more than 3,000 tons of coal a day . The start of coal usage at Arthur Kill has been scheduled for Feb. 1 , but the utility said yesterday it could not predict firmly when Big Allis might return to operation  --  with oil or coal . Of its two nuclear-powered generators at Indian Point , Con Edison hopes to return the 262,000-kilowatt Unit No. 1 to service this week after repairs and refueling since Dec. 29 . But the 873,000-kilowatt Unit No. 2 , out of service since Oct. 12 , is awaiting United States Atomic Energy Commission approvals of repairs that are nearly completed . Today 's meeting in Washington at the Federal Energy Office is to be attended by John T. Carroll , the city 's Municipal Service Administrator and energy coordinator , and Herbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as Con Edison 's oil suppliers and Gerald Turetsky , regional Federal oil administrator . Mr. Turetsky said yesterday there should be " some immediate hard judgments on granting relief and providing a safety reserve factor , " although he said " we are not faced at this stage with blackouts or major interruptions for extended periods of time . " Mr. Turetsky said nearly 30 per cent of the residual oil used in the United States has been imported . Modern domestic refineries , he said , have only a limited ability to expand their proportion of residual oil derived from crude oil , from perhaps 6 to 8 per cent of each 42-gallon barrel now to 10 or 12 per cent , he said . Caribbean refineries , Mr. Tu- , retsky said , operate with pro- ! duction of 30 to 40 per cent , residual oil , while Europe and other areas are even slightly ; above that level . " In recent weeks , " Mr. Turetskysaid , " our biggest problem has been created by those who were urging a complacent attitude or being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shortage . "
