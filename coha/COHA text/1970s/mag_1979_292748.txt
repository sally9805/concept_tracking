Carter commutes her sentence <P> When all legal efforts failed to overturn the conviction of Patty Hearst for armed robbery , her lawyers and friends mounted a campaign to persuade President Carter to commute her sentence . They argued that Patty had suffered enough and indeed had been treated with special severity by the law because of the wealth and social prominence of her family . Thousands of calls and letters poured into the White House urging her release . <P> Carter and the Department of Justice agreed with those pleas , and last week after a presidential commutation , Patty Hearst was freed from a California prison , five months before she was eligible for parole . She had served 22 months and 17 days of her seven-year sentence for her part in the Symbionese Liberation Army bank robbery in April 1974 . <P> Noted the Justice Department in its recommendation for clemency : " It is the consensus of all those most familiar with this case that but for the extraordinary criminal and personal offenses that the petitioner suffered at the hands of the S.L.A. she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... and would have not suffered the punishment and other consequences she has endured . " That raised the question of whether she should have been brought to trial in the first place . <P> But for Patty Hearst , the commutation was the chance to start again . " This is what we all wanted , " she said , waving her release papers before being driven to her family 's posh home in the San Francisco suburbs for a catered champagne breakfast with her now legally separated parents , her four sisters and a crying and cheering group of friends . <P> " I 've gotten a lot stronger and a lot more self-confident , " Patty said as she chatted easily with the hundreds of reporters gathered at the house . " I take a lot of things in stride that make other people fall apart , and I think mostly that I 've learned a lot about people . I was 19 years old when I was kidnaped and I 'll be 25 in a couple of weeks . " <P> She seemed to have learned even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ski parka to show a T shirt bearing the words PARDON ME . She pointed to a large round pendant hung around her neck with the inscription SURVIVOR , 2-4-74 , the date she was dragged screaming from her apartment by the S.L.A. " Now I 'll get the other date on at the bottom , " she vowed . " Today 's date . " <P> Some time in April , Patty plans to marry San Francisco Policeman Bernard Shaw , 33 , her bodyguard while she was free on bond pending her appeals , but she has not decided whether to take his name . " I do n't anticipate anyone calling me Patty Shaw , " she said . Asked where she could go to escape being Patty Hearst , she replied with a tough edge to her voice : " I do n't see anything wrong with being Patty Hearst . "
