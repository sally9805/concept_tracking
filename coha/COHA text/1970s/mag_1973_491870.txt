It is T-minus-five-years  --  and counting .... Inside the muraled , high-ceilinged room , men in white shirts are moving about quietly , purposefully , almost like high priests at a shrine . All around them , spread out in white-and-gray pieces on a turquoise rug , the contours of the future are taking place . " This is like a three-dimensional picture of the project . Only it 's the kind of picture you can get inside of , " says research pilot Alan Moyles , of Rockwell International , Corp . He is scrambling through a mock-up of America 's next great adventure in space  --  the space shuttle . " This , " he says , pausing in a pilot 's space compartment that looks like the flight deck in a jet plane , " this is going to change the entire way we look at space . " In the breathless years of the 1960 's , as Americans first prepared to hurtle to the moon , the way we looked at space fell into neat clich6s : adventurous , beckoning , exciting ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valorousfew  --  for daring , disciplined men who usually had years of experience in the armed forces or as test pilots before they undertook more years of training for a brief space voyage . The American people matched such daring and determination with our own chief resource : treasure . We committed more than $25 billion to the manned space program and did not shrink from the awesome prodigality of the program . We used , but had to abandon , some $280 million worth of equipment ( rockets , service modules , lunar modules , etc. ) on each of the Apollo-Saturn flights . We left on the surface of the moon everything from Hasselblad cameras to moon buggies because we could n't pack up everything and bring it home to use again . It was the price we had to pay to continue the questing tradition of the nation though some said that the price was too high . So when Apollo 17 splashed down into the sun-drenched waters of the Pacific last December with its cargo of lunar material , most thought  --  some gladly  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be exhumed . Not so . The style , tone and amplitude of our space effort changed but not its sense of purpose . For in the next phase we 'll put more people into space than we ever did in the Apollo program but we 'll be doing it in a different way for a different reason : we 'll be in the utilitarian rather than the explorative stage of space voyage  --  one in which we 'll be using the knowledge gained in space in the past to seek the bettering of the quality of life on earth . The means as well as the ends will be different : We 'll be flying in reusable space shuttles that can take off like a rocket , fly like a spacecraft and return to earth like a conventional plane . We 'll have highly trained flight crews to man the shuttle but the work in space will be conducted by non-astronauts ( women as well as men ) who will work , without extravagant exTHE // haustive flight training , in an " earth-air " environment , normally wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost $130,000 apiece in the Apollo program ) . We 'll be doing it at a fraction of the cost of the Apollo program because so much of the equipment will be recovered and used again . Thus it cost $1,000 to lift one pound into space during the Apollo program , partially because so much equipment was lost , never to be used again . In the space shuttle , it will cost approximately $100 to lift one pound into space . The reason : we 'll be able to recover and reuse every bit of equipment on the space shuttle with the exception of one fuel tank per flight . The changing look of our ventures into space is evident today . Fart of the evidence is in the Skylab project , which is already in orbit , and which was shown in the previous issue of the Post . Skylab uses hardware left over from the Apollo project  --  a leftover third stage of a Saturn rocket is the Skylab  --  and the crew makes the round trip in the " old-fashioned " way : via a rocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunge through the atmosphere and a pickup at sea . But though the technology of Skylab is " old , " the intent is new ; it is to gather knowledge against the day when the space shuttle will be operating routinely in space  --  knowledge on how man might be affected mentally , biologically , or physiologically by living for long periods in space . That is why the first phase of the Skylab project was to last twenty-eight days in space and why the second and third phases are scheduled for fifty-six days each . Another part of the evidence is here on earth . It is scattered through the vast hangars of an aerospace plant in southern California  --  that of Rockwell International . It is here that the first Orbiter , the passenger-cargo-carrying element ofthe space shuttle , will be designed and built . It is here that the mock-ups of the future are already being assembled . This " three-dimensional picture " of the future is n't completed as yet . The wings are n't on it and neither is the 60-foot-long by 15-foot diameter cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartment . ( " We know what that will look like , " says one engineer . ) But the bits and pieces that are available give a strong hint about the spectacular new dimensions of space travel . Among the most conspicuous will be the design . For the space shuttle will not have the straight , slim , tubelike configuration of the Saturn rocket , a Roman candle with a man on top . Instead it will look more like a delta-winged dart  --  mounted on a " trimaran . " ( A " trimaran " is literally a boat with three hulls , or with one hull and two pontoons , all three in the water . It differs from the catamaran , whose pontoons are in the water but whose hull is not . ) For the space shuttle will be made up of three different sorts of pieces , all of which will lift off together and three of which will be returned to earth to be used again . Here is a close look at its various parts : The Passenger Vehicle . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Rockwell International is building . It is 125 feet long  --  about as large as a commercial jet  --  and 57 feet high at the tip of its tail . It will have three huge rocket engines to help lift it off the launching pad and two smaller engines to nudge it from one point in orbit to another , and then , most importantly , to prod it out of orbit and back towards earth , the dart with its cargo bay winch will carry up to 65,000 pounds of material into space ( satellite , telescope , space instruments , etc . ) . Near its deck will be a passenger compartment for as many as six passengers  --  astronomers , geologists , hydrologists , technicians  --  any of the non-astronauts who may be called upon to fill assignments in space . In effect , the Orbiter is the plane . It not only has flight controls and passenger space but a rudder , wings , and a tricycle landing gear so that it can come back to earth and land on a runway , much as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tank This is the centerpiece , the long metal finger that sits under the Orbiter as part of the trimaran . It 's longer than any other part of the space shuttle-185 feet altogether  --  and because of its size and position , it looks like the rocket . Ifs not , however . It contains nothing but fuel  --  liquid hydrogen with oxygen propellants  --  that is fed into the Orbiter as the Orbiter 's huge tailpipe engines help boost the craft off the ground and towards orbit . When the fuel tank is empty it 'll be dropped off the Orbiter and allowed to splash down into the ocean . ( " It 's the world 's biggest ' drop ' tank , " says Alan Moyles , referring to the outside fuel tanks long carried by fighter planes . ) Why is n't all the fuel carried inside the Orbiter , as in most jet bombers and commercial planes ? It was in the original concept for the Orbiter . But then the engineers would have had to make the Orbiter very much larger ; because there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " about twice as long as it is now , " says Moyles . That would also have made the Orbiter very much heavier when it came back to earth and prepared to land . The heavier the plane , the faster its landing speed ; so the Orbiter would have landed at much more than its currently-planned 160 knots ( about 184 miles per hour ) . There was also the problem of safety : " You ca n't be sure that you 've purged the tanks of every bit of fuel , " says Moyles , particularly with an unusual , and highly volatile , fuel such as liquid 62 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST July lAuguat ' 73 hydrogen . " There still might be pockets that have turned into a volatile gas lingering in the tank when you think it 's empty . " That , of course , could pose something of a hazard , particularly on the incoming flight when the temperatures on Orbiter 's skin will rise swiftly during the entry back into the atmosphere . So NASA and the design engineers decided to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tank off the space shuttle when it is empty  --  not only remove the potential hazard but lower both the weight and the landing speed of the incoming Orbiter . The Solid Fuel Rocket Boosters The Orbiter is so heavy at lift-off  --  with all equipment and fuel  --  that it needs extra help in getting off the ground . So two " booster " rockets have been added to give it extra thrust . They 'll be attached to the sides of the main fuel tank , a little back from its nose . They will use a solid fuel propellant for their own rocket engines  --  as contrasted to the liquid hydrogen system of the Orbiter  --  and they 'll develop a total of 6,500,000 pounds of thrust ( compared to the 1,310,000 pounds of thrust developed by the Orbiter 's main engines ) . The boosters will be highly sophisticated , and expensive , rocket engines ; so  --  though they too will be jettisoned from the space shuttle and be landed by parachute  --  they 'll carry a homing beacon that will make it easy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to be used again . Thus the space shuttle is designed to go up as a four-piece combination ( passenger vehicle , fuel tank , and a pair of booster rockets ) and come back as individual pieces . The significant thing is that the pieces come back at all . The only thing we ever recovered from the Apollo missions was the tip of the whole unit  --  the top 13 feet of the 363-foot-long rocket and spacecraft ( i.e. , thecrew compartment ) . The rest was either abandoned or burned up in space . The way that we 'll get them back  --  indeed , the way that the whole space shuttle will function  --  is illustrated best by taking a look at what a routine flight might be : At lift-off : All the units of the space shuttle will be linked together and tilted vertically  --  on the Orbiter 's tail , so to speak  --  just as rockets have always been mounted at lift-off . Perhaps the gantry will be somewhat different than in the past . There 's a likelihood that it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the outside rockets  --  connected by a massive multi-level crosswalk on which technicians will be working on the Orbiter and the external fuel tank . The passengers and crew will enter the Orbiter an hour or so before lift-off . The countdowns will take less than two hours , instead of the two days to two weeks that were devoted to total countdowns in the past . Just after lift-off : The space shuttle takes off in a great arc with its rockets leaving a rooster tail of flame behind it , like spray from a racing boat . In just over two minutes , the shuttle rises to between 20 and 25 miles above the earth 's surface . At that point , the two booster rockets shut off . They are automatically dropped off the shuttle system . They start falling back to earth until a drogue parachute pops out on each one at about 22,000 feet and a main parachute pops out at 6,000 feet . Each one lands softly in the Atlantic Ocean , about 184 miles from Cape Kennedy . A tug is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the signals from the homing device , churns to precisely where they 're located . It picks the rockets out of the water and brings them back to Cape Kennedy , to be examined , repaired  --  if necessary  --  refueled , and used again . Thus with the space shuttle it wo n't be necessary to keep large fleets of Navy units on station around the world to look for elements of the rocket-and-shuttle system . Into orbit : At a height of about 50 nautical miles ( roughly 57 miles by landlubbers ' measure ) , the Orbiter with its fuel tank will go into orbit around the earth . It would take about twelve minutes to get to that point , from lift-off . On the early flights , the orbit will be elliptical , or oval-shaped  --  perhaps 57 miles above the earth in one direction and 115 miles in the other direction . Very soon after the shuttle is inserted into orbit , the main fuel tank feeding the Orbiter 's rocket engines runs dry . Indeed , the main lift-off engines of the Orbiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are used only on the outbound leg of the flight and will usually be shut off permanently once orbit has been achieved . So the flight crew flicks a switch and the fuel tank is cut loose from the Orbiter , a de-orbit motor ignites and the tank plunges down into the atmosphere . It will land in the Indian Ocean ? " at a point where there is very little maritime travel , " says a space engineer . The fuel tank will have no parachutes to slow its plunge ; it will probably start burning and come apart as it re-enters the atmosphere , and it will hit the water in pieces that will soon sink . Thus this will he the only part of the space shuttle that will not be recovered and used again . The loss will cost money ; some say that the fuel and fuel tank on every space shuttle flight will cost two million dollars . But the loss will be offset by savings in the simplified design and construction of the tank . There 'll be no need to cover it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-enters the atmosphere . ( The booster rockets // are already in the atmosphere when they are jettisoned , so they are n't exposed to the same temperatures that an object re-entering from outside the atmosphere encounters . ) Nor will there be any need to install parachutes and homing devices that make it possible to land and find it . Most of all , it wo n't be necessary to send a naval unit halfway around the world to pick up the fuel tank and then sail halfway around the world  --  again  --  to return it to Cape Kennedy . Since the fuel tank is a very simple device , the philosophy is to keep it simple , to hold down the cost  --  and let it sink and build a new one . The return : When the assignment is finished at last , the crew recovers all the passengers and equipment , then buttons up into a secure status and fires the orbital maneuvering rockets that are located in pods adjacent to the Orbiter 's rudder . That firing nudges the vehicle out of orbit and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17,000 miles per hour , the Orbiter re-enters the atmosphere and begins to heat up . Eventually parts of the plane will reach a temperature of 2,500 to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit , but efficient systems of heat dissipation and insulation will prevent the hottest spots  --  such as the nose of the Orbiter and the leading edge of the wings  --  from melting . All the while the Orbiter will be gliding through the atmosphere  --  its orbital maneuvering rockets off by now  --  instead of plummeting through it . In effect , it will be acting like a hugeglider . At about 50,000 feet , its crew will begin making a wide turn in order to line up with the runway at Cape Kennedy . ( The shuttle could also land at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California , if necessary , and  --  theoretically at least  --  it could come down on any 10,000-foot runway that was available , if an extreme emergency developed . ) As the Orbiter approaches the runway , aerial " brakes " operated by computer help slow the plane down . At that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming in " dead stick " and so if it comes in too " hot " ? at too fast a speed  --  and is likely to overshoot the runway , the pilot ca n't jam the throttles forward and go around for another try . So if he 's gliding in too fast , the pilot will begin making sweeping S-curves to use up some of the energy of his approach . The actual landing speed-184 miles per hour  --  is faster than a commercial jet but it is not as fast as some of the experimental planes that the United States has been testing for well over a decade . When the plane rolls to a stop , the passengers and crew dismount , the cargo bay is emptied , and the Orbiter is then turned over to the ground crew to be readied for the next flight . The whole turnaround process , will take fourteen days . By that time , there 'll likely be another shuttle already in orbit . For current plans call for construction of at least two Orbiters . Those plans are flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be built . Some 30 to 40 shuttle flights a year will be scheduled in the early phases of theprogram ; some space experts envision 60 flights a year not long after that . Each Orbiter will be good for that and more : they are being designed to make a minimum of 100 flights with only routine maintenance . In fact , NASA believes that the total cost of the shuttle ? $5.2 billion over many years  --  will be paid off and a 10 percent profit earned on its investment if some 512 shuttle flights can be completed over a period of twelve years , an average of 43 flights per year . However spectacular and meaningful all this appears , the space shuttle is still a project for the future . The first test flights of the Orbiter  --  using a special engine for horizontal flights just over the earth  --  wo n't take place until 1976 . The first manned orbital tests of the Orbiter wo n't take place before 1978 . And the first scheduled flights will start early in the 1980 's . Nevertheless it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future simply by examining the " three-dimensional picture " ? the mock-up of the Orbiter in the DEl Room ( for Design , Engineering , Inspection ) ? at the Rockwell International plant in Downey , near Los Angeles . There is a profound sense of history in going to the plant where the Orbiter mock-up is on display . For this was long part of North American Aviation  --  since merged into Rockwell International  --  and for many persons , North American was aviation . The P-51 Mustang -- some say the greatest fighter plane of World War II- was built Continued on page 90 by them . So were the F-86 Sabrejet and the F-100 Supersabre , the world 's first supersonic aircraft . The X-15 , the black bullet that set records of height and speed for winged aircraft  --  as opposed to rockets ? was built by North American and so was the triplesonic XB-70 , the high altitude bomber ( with the " droop snot " ) that provided our scientists with a quantum leap in the understanding of aerodynamics . Just a few months ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the B-52 as a bomber-deterrent , were moved out of a nearby North American plant to undergo flight testing at a sagebrush-strewn desert north of Los Angeles . And the scorched remains of three Apollo flights  --  the command modules of Apollo 14 , 16 and 17 ? stand in a shed not far from the DEI room , being taken apart and examined minutely by the men who built them . The DE1 room itself is lofty , airy , bright . One wall has a mural of the vast vacuum of space ; another has a mural of the Orbiter , explicit , disciplined and clear as an engineering drawing . The Orbiter mock-up is lined up on the floor to match exactly the mural on the wall  --  nose on nose , tailpipe on tailpipe . There areflat , two-dimensional figures painted on the wall mural , but those in the mock-up are three-dimensional : people like the engineers  --  who come to see how pipes or instruments or equipment might be arranged in " reality " instead of only on paper  --  and people like ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a door much like that of a door in a commercial jet . That , in itself , was a change . The astronauts entered the Apollo spacecraft by gripping a " chinning bar " that stretched across the top of the hatch opening , hoisting themselves up and over the lip of the hatch , and sliding feet first into the interior . The passenger of the space shuttle wo n't even have to he that athletic . " Anybody can fly in the space shuttle who 's in average good health , " one space engineer told me . On the inside of the Orbiter , the passenger will find a half dozen contour chairs . These seats are capable of being locked semiupright though tilted backwards for lift-off into space , or being extended fully for sleeping in space . The passenger wo n't have to wear a space suit as long as he is remaining in the passenger en mpar t ment : it 'll he kept pressurized  --  as a jet plane is pressurized  --  and it 'll be fed a constant mixture of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth . ( The Apollo spacecrafts originally were designed to let the crew live in a 100 percent oxygen atmosphere . ) There is another factor in the use of the space shuttle : the passengers would have to spend several hours before lift-off breathing 100 percent oxygen in order to wash the nitrogen from their blood , to reduce the likelihood of bends , in case the cabin pressure had n't held during lift-off . What the passengers will wear , that 's akin to the Apollo astronauts garb , is a CWG ? a Constant Wear Garment : underwear that does n't have to be changed every day . Over it they 'll wear a coverall of synthetic fiber . Otherwise , lint or other small particles of a natural fiber , might float free in the weightless status of space and cause trouble in the electronic apparatus . ( For the same reason , men in the space shuttle will shave with a foamless soap  --  one which will " capture " whiskers and prevent them from floating around  --  and all passengers will brush their teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Their coveralls will also likely have stomach- or chest-level pockets so that the passengers can tuck their hands into them when they go to sleep . Otherwise their hands would float free in the weightless atmosphere . Some of the Gemini and Apollo astronauts were startled to find , on awakening from their sleep , that their hands were dangling around in front of their faces , like vines in a watery jungle , because in early flights they did n't have a place to put them . For some of the time in flight , the space shuttle passenger will likely remain strapped to his contour couch . For once the straps are removed , the passenger will tend to move weightlessly about the spacecraft , like a feather in a breeze . He can guide himself , somewhat like a swimmer underwater . And he will want to guide himself at times . For there is a galley in the right rear of the passenger compartment where warm meals can be prepared . ( A menu of 72 items , including lol-ster Newburg , filet mignon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current Skylab project . ) The galley is n't big , but then there is n't likely to be a rush for food at any one time : the working hours for people in the Orbiter will likely be staggered so that a few contour chairs  --  hut not all  --  will always be used for sleepers while others are awake and hungry and looking for sustenance , and still others are in space on a work shift . There is also a lavatory at the left rear of the passenger compartment , just inside the door . It includes , of course , a chemical toilet but even that is considerably more familiar in style and tone than the body-waste disposal systems used in previous way NASA chose to do it . The work that the shuttle can do provides a vast spectrum of opportunities that could not be matched by the manned space program of the past , particularly in terms of economics . For example : *The shuttle could save hundreds of millions of dollars by repairing satellites already in space . The repairs could be undertaken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the shuttle . Or the shuttle could go up into space , retrieve a broken-down satellite by use of the shuttle 's long extender-arms , tuck it into the Orbiter 's cargo bay , and return it to earth , where the satellite could be repaired  --  if the repair work is very complicated  --  and then sent aloft again . The significance , and savings , of all this is reflected in the Orbiting Astronomic Observatories . This was an effort to move very sensitive , and very expensive , cameras into key positions in earth orbit so they could peer into the black vacuum of space and send back signals on their observations of the planets and the stars . The idea was that they could work day and night , never hampered by the clouds and the smog that sometimes afflict our earthbound telescopes . Each OAO was forbiddingly expensive ? " enough to build a half dozen Mount Palomars , " says one space expert . The potentially great returns were marred by very small mishaps . The first OAO took off and went into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very short time . It seems that a battery re-charger failed to function and when the batteries on the satellite went dead , so did its usefulness . Another OAO was sent up and its electronics worked perfectly and it went into perfect orbit  --  but it did n't send back anything at all . The reason : the protective shrouds covering the cameras never came off ; they just stayed on the satellite as it cruised around in orbit . So there was about $150 million of hardware up there in the sky  --  completely useless because of very minor mishaps . With the space shuttle , NASA might have sent repairmen aloft to take the shrouds off one OAO and to replace the battery charger and the batteries on the other . And to prevent the waste of a profoundly important and costly project . *The shuttle could itself become an inexpensive system of putting satellites in orbit . In the 1960 's , the cost of launching unmanned space probes ran from $20 million to $35 million apiece . There was one trouble : when the satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . The $20 million or $35 million used up on the launching  --  plus the cost of the satellite  --  might all have been wasted . The space shuttle could eliminate that risk . It could tuck one or two or three satellites in its cargo bay and with only one shuttle launch hoist all of them into space and put them in precise orbit at different spots around the earth . Moreover , it could linger on station beside them until it was determined that each satellite was working perfectly ; there 'd he no risk of a multimillion-dollar breakdown . Each launch of a space shuttle is expected to cost $10.5 million . With three satellites to carry into space  --  each costing $20 to $35 million to launch  --  the space shuttle could cut that $60- to $105-million launching cost down some 83 to 90 percent . In addition , the space shuttle could be used to lower the cost of making deep space probes by allowing the space vehicle to " start " from earth orbit instead of from the earth . The most demanding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground and above the earth 's atmosphere . All of Stages 1 and 2 of the Saturn rockets were devoted to that effort , and all were wasted because they could n't be reused . If the thrust needed were cut down to , say , the power of the service module on the Apollo flights  --  the engine that guided the manned quarters out of earth orbit and lunar orbit ? then all the costs of the bottom parts of the Saturn could be eliminated . How to do it ? By using the space shuttle . It could take up a space system piece by piece and then hoist up an engineering crew to put the pieces together . It could next hoist up the flight crew to fly the mission . And it could then keep on station the crew needed to launch the mission . Consider one of the potential deep-space probes that might he executed in the 1980 's : a landing on Mars . We already know the ideal dates for such an expedition . It would start on April 5 , 1985 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up so that the route will not only be short but useful in a particular way . The mission would swing past Venus on September I0 , 1985 ? giving the spacecraft a critical , rare and extremely valuable gravitational boost  --  and reach Mars April 10 , 1986 . The explorers would spend 40 days on or near the surface of Mars , lift off on May 20 , 1986 , and return to the vicinity of Earth on November 15 , 1986 , some 590 days after the start of the space voyage . The significant phrase is " vicinity of Earth . " For the trip would not start and end on earth ; it would start and end in earth orbit . The space shuttle would provide the ultimate link between the earth and earth orbit . The reason is that the cost of building boosters big enough to carry men to and from Mars would be prohibitive . It would be much easier to build only the crew compartments and the rocket engines needed to move them out of earth orbit . The smaller spacecraft could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuttle , linked together in space by experts , provided with both supplies and crew coming up by shuttle , and then " launched " from space . Similarly , t he returning crewmen would n't plunge through the atmosphere and splash down in the ocean . They 'd go into orbit around the earth and be picked up by the space shuttle which would return them to a " normal " landing on the runway at Cape Kennedy . Hence the mere existence of the space shuttle provides opportunities in safety and economy for deep-space probes that otherwise would n't exist . *And the Orbiter could be used as a laboratory in space . At one time , it was believed that NASA would develop a separate and very elaborate Space Laboratory that would orbit around the earth for as long as ten years . It would be supplied by the space shuttle , which would deliver fresh supplies , fresh scientists , even fresh experiments completely enclosed in pods that could be attached to the central core of the Space Laboratory . But the cost of both the Space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of priorities was set up and the conclusion was that it was more sensible to build the transportation system  --  the space shuttle  --  before building the more exotic Space Laboratory . Then somebody studied the space shuttle and suddenly perceived that it could be a transportation system and a space laboratory : that the 60-foot-long cargo hay could be fitted out to hold scientists-in-residence almost as easily as it could be fitted out to hold space satellites . The scientists could ride up into orbit in the passenger compartment , enter the cargo compartment via an airlock , and there undertake in a space environment , experiments in medicine , metallurgy , astronomics , biochemistry , biophysics , agriculture , ecology , any and all of the sciences . ( The experiments which have been suggested so far range from synthesizing organic molecules in space to searching for new energy sources which might transform life on earth . ) Thus the returns that the shuttle offers are not financial alone . They are the kind of returns that can change the whole quality of life on earth . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. , readiness to change the way we look at our ventures in space . In the space shuttle era , they will no longer be costly feats of derring-do , but a well-planned effort designed to make the assets of space routinely useful to the people on earth . It will take a while to achieve that new perspective , for the earthbound symbols of the voyage to space  --  the gantries in Florida ? are quiet now , stark and skeletal against the velvet sky . They are a symbol of the past and present . A more subtle symbol is in the DEI room of Rockwell International . One can see and touch and tour the reality of today that holds the contours of the future : the Orbiter mock-up that stands so close to reality that we can say today that it is . T-minus-five years . . . and counting . 72
