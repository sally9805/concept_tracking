A check printed on dark red paper ? That bright idea is not some new Christmas Club banking gimmick but an imaginative scheme for making a little money and protecting the confidentiality of personal banking records at the same time . As a two-year federal study into the abuses of privacy showed earlier this year ( TIME , July 18 ) , the microfilm records kept by banks of all the checks written by their customers are being made available , not only to the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service but to an army of local and private snoops as well . <P> Such easy access to intimate financial dealings disturbs many people , * but it made James M. Blackley , 30 , president of the Charlotte , N.C. , Libertarian Society , see red-literally-and then think green . Learning that ordinary microfilm is unable to distinguish between certain shades of red and other colors , including blue and black ink , Blackley decided to start printing checks on red paper . When the checks were made out , the ink would be perfectly visible against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he figured , it would become a blank ; anything written or printed would disappear . <P> And so it proved in practice . Early this year Blackley formed a company , Liberty Graphics of Charlotte , to make and market red checks . To date he has sold some 60,000 ( at a nickel apiece for orders of 500 ) , Except for the color , the check is a blushing copy of the personal checks that his customers send in to be reproduced ; the red-faced checks even include the bank 's magnetized numbers for automatic sorting . It is possible to microfilm the checks with special equipment , but most banks find that regular processing produces a gray blur . Bankers speculate that since banks are required by law to keep microfilm records , a time may come when an individual 's use of Blackley 's checks might require legal challenge . <P> Blackley concedes that a few scoundrels eager to cloak their financial transactions from prying eyes may be among his customers , but he insists that most buyers are reputable people . So far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case where anyone has refused to cash a red check . Adds Blackley : " It 's not devious ; it 's just red paper . It 's for privacy . " <P> *Not the Supreme Court : in a 7-to-2 decision , it upheld the Government 's use of microfilmed checks as evidence against a Georgia moonshiner . It explained that under the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures , the man had no right of privacy , since his checks were instruments in a commercial transaction .
