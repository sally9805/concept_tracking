 | The temperature was 18 ? F and plunging . A gusty little wind was swirling through the scrub trees and clumps of grass clinging to the hillside in the high desert country an hour 's drive from Albuquerque as I hurried from the Citroen across the dirt drive and into the 31-foot white dome . Inside , the 68 ? temperature felt especially satisfying because no fuel had been burned to generate it -- -except 93-million miles away in the sun 's thermonuclear belly . Several electric lights illuminated the dome brightly . The record player was turned up too high ; someone cranked it down as I was introduced . Yet no utility line comes onto the property . Three wind machines outside , a bank of storage batteries , and solid-state power conditioning equipment supply all needed electric power , both to the dome and to the nearby design facility containing workshop with power tools , kitchen , electronics shop , darkroom , and drafting rooms . I was in the world 's only 100-percent solar-heated , wind-powered residence . The dome , a working laboratory that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the exhibit of Integrated Life Support Systems Li tories , a private research organization trying to develop -- among other things ? solar-powered housing including entire communities . And they 're not the ones . I 've just made a swing around the country ing a crop of new ? and not so new ? solar homes . Spurred by the energy crunch , the field is hopping . For example : ? The National Science Foundation has just a awarded three university-industry teams $1.5 million to find what , if any , technological advances are needs recommend plans for building solar homes . ? NASA has announced plans to build a square-foot engineering building at Langley ( ' enter in Virginia that will be heated and solar energy . ? A move is underway in Congress to a the money to build 2000 solar homes right o And interest is high among professionals : At a recent mechanical engineering conference in the solar-energy presentations were among popular , drawing large crowds for every An old idea with new life The idea of heating houses by collecting has been attractive ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth credible rate of a thousand watts per square foot . The first real attempt to grab some of this for home heating and hot water came in 1938 research team at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-@# nology built the first in a series of four solar homes . The basic approach worked out there is still in use ? though with variations . Take a black metal plate and put it in the sun . It gets hot . Cover it with glass . Glass is transparent to visible light , opaque to infrared . Thus the sun 's light can get in to heat the plate . But when it tries to reradiate infrared , the energy is trapped . Build in channels through which a fluid ? air or water ? can be pumped to carry the heat away to where it can be used . The MIT houses used water as the heat-transfer fluid , then used the hot water both for domestic purposes ? clothes washing and bathing ? and for heating the house . Auxiliary heat ? for prolonged spells of cloudy weather ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses have now been built around the country . Here are some of the most interesting I have seen . The Thomason houses Many years ago , a Washington patent attorney named Harry Thomason was caught in a sudden shower on a farm in North Carolina . Taking shelter under a shed with a rusty tin roof , he noticed that the runoff was hot . That got him to thinking , and in 1959 he built a small home near District Heights , Md. , just two miles from the Washington , D. C. border , making use of that lesson . The south slope of Thomason 's roof is covered with black , corrugated aluminum , backed by a slab of insulation . An inch above the aluminum is window Continued  | glass . At the peak of the roof is a galvanized pipe with a string of holes along one side . Each hole is aligned so that a small jet of water shoots into each corrugation , runs down the slope picking up heat from the hot aluminum , and drips into a trough at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water down into a 1500-gallon tank in the basement . The tank , in turn , rests in a bin filled with 50 tons of egg-sized stones . The water , usually at a temperature of 125 ? to 135 ? , heats the stones packed around the tank . Thomason blows air from the house heating system through the stones where it picks up heat . Two thermistors constantly measure temperature of the roof and the water in the tank . As long as the roof is hotter than the tank , water circulates . When the roof cools , circulation stops . The system can collect some heat even on cloudy days . Thus if the water is relatively cool , it may be operating when the sun is not visible . If too many cloudy days come in a row , an auxiliary oil burner comes on . During its first three years , Thomason 's house cost $18.45 to heat ; similar homes in the cold Washington climate cost several hundred dollars . Since then , Thomason has built two more solar homes , including the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a nippy day recently , he led the way up a ladder to the roof and stuck his pocket thermometer in the gutter below the collector . The temperature was 125 ? . Inside , the house was hot . The water tank and stones serve as both heat exchanger and heat storage . Thomason figures he can collect enough heat on one sunny day to last for two . The house can coast for four cloudy winter days on stored heat . In his new house , Thomason has added some refinements . In the summer , he runs his air conditioner at night when the load on the utility is least and the outside temperature low . Thus he increases the efficiency of his air conditioner , perhaps by as much as 100 percent . He pumps the cool , dry air through the bin which cools and dries the stones . Then in the @# @# daytime , he pumps house air through the bin , cooli and dehumidifying it . ( If you 'd like to see plans - Thomason 's house , they 're available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. - 08007 , for $10 . A license to build the house is $21 ' Heat plus electricity In sharp contrast to Harry Thomason 's seat-of-t pants design is what must be the most technological ) . advanced solar home now in existence , at the University of Delaware . " This is the first house in whi there has been a substantial effort to collect both electric and thermal energy , " says Dr. Karl Boer , head of the university 's Institute of Energy Conversion . four-by-eight-ft. roof panels will be mounted cadmium sulfide solar cells that turn part of the solar energy directly into electricity . Behind these panels are channels for moving air , which keeps the solar cells from overheating . The hot air is piped to the basement where the heat is extracted and stored . The sophisticated storage system was developed h : . Dr. Maria Telkes , a solar pioneer associated with some of the early MIT houses . It is made up of bins containing plastic tubes of eutectic salts ? chemicals with a melting point in the range needed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large amount of heat as it goes from the solid to the liquid stage , yet does not change temperature . When it returns to the solid state , it gives up the heat , again remaining at constant temperature . The Boer house contains three such bins . One has a melting point at 125 ? and is used to store solar heat during the winter . ( A heat pump supplies auxiliary heat during prolonged cloudy spells . ) Another has a melting point of 50 ? . During clear summer nights , the roof panels radiate to the night sky . Air passing behind the panels is chilled and circulated through the 50 ? salts to extract the heat . On cloudy nights , the salts are chilled with the heat pump . Then , during the daytime , air circulated through the salt bin is cooled . A third bin contains 75 ? salts . Drs . Boer and Telkes call it a thermal flywheel ; when house temperature rises this bin absorbs heat and cools the air . When the house cools , the bin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells is stored in lead-acid auto batteries and used for lights and other purposes where DC energy can be used . Ultimately , such a house might contain equipment to change the DC into 115-volt AC . The Delaware House is a sophisticated example of what solar houses may one day become . But such a system is far in the future , and many problems remain . The main one , perhaps , is the solar cells them-@#  | selves . Dr. Boer hopes that his cadmium sulfide cells wil1 eventually be cheap enough for such use , but no one knows for sure just how much they will cost and how long they will last . The eutectic-salts heat-storage system has some unsolved problems , too . e Florida house -- an original One of the oldest operating solar houses in operation and the one you see on this month 's cover ? is just cT the campus of the University of Florida in Gainesville . It was built 18 years ago by the mechanical engineering department to measure heat flow into and it of a home and was converted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there one cold , rainy day this minter , water in the tank had been keeping the house warm , yet remained at 120 ? . Now Dr. Erich Farber and his associates are planing to install an absorption air conditioner that will Aerate on the heat from the solar collectors . The passive house Twenty years ago a chemist and building-materials expert named Harold Hay was in India on a technical aid mission for the U. S. Government . Many people , he noticed , lived in rusty sheet-metal shacks , which were hot in the day , cold at night . " I realized that even if such houses had insulation , " he recalls , " it would be in the wrong place half of the time . What was really needed was insulation on wheels . " Hay 's idea was to be able to remove the insulation from the roof on winter days so the roof would get hot and heat the inside of the house . Then the insulation would be put in place on top of the roof and the heat would be retained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would happen , letting the house cool at night and replacing the insulation in the daytime to keep out the heat . Over the years he refined the idea , and in the late 1960 's , Hay and John Yellott , a solar-heating authority and now visiting professor of architecture at Arizona State University , built a 10-by-12-foot-square building with a flat water tank on top . During the summer , the slab of foam insulation was rolled back at night and the water became cold . Since this reservoir sat directly on a metal ceiling , it absorbed heat from the room and kept the builing air conditioned all day . During the winter , it was opened during the day to collect heat . It then radiated enough heat into the house through the ceiling at night to keep the room comfortable . Every day for 18 months Hay pulled on a rope that moved the insulation one hour after dawn and one hour before sunset . Instruments supplied by Yellott recorded inside and outside temperatures and other data . It was a spectacular success . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I had to wear a sweater and coat inside to stay warm . " But despite the success , Hay had trouble getting anyone interested in building a full-scale house . Finally , he put together a design team headed by Prof. Kenneth Haggard of California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo and got a government grant of $40 ; 000 . That was just enough to pay for data collection , so Hay borrowed money and paid for construction of the house himself . It was finished in August , and a family with three children moved in last September . As you drive up to it , the building gives no hint that it is very different from other homes on the block . But it is . Hay led the way up a ladder to the roof and the difference was evident . Bags of water 40 feet long , eight feet wide , and slightly less than a foot deep fit into frames built to hold them . Telescoping polystyrene panels can cover the water bags or open them to the sky . Automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the panels as needed to provide either winter heat or summer cooling . Preliminary data indicate that the patented system will be able to supply all summer air conditioning and most of the winter heating ? all with a simple waterbed roof . The all-out approach to independent power Undoubtedly the most ambitious system I saw was the one on that New Mexico hillside built by ILS Laboratories . Most solar houses now being built are designed to collect only part of their heat ? and in some cases cooling ? from the sun . And , of course , almost all still count on the central power station for electricity . The ILS installation , on the other hand , gets all of its power from the sun and wind . The design is strictly no-compromise . The dome is a steel shell lined with three inches of plastic foam . Windows are small ? a series of portholes . Cooking is done with a microwave oven ? which uses less energy than conventional cooking . Robert Reines , director of the laboratory , told me that the building stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 10 cloudy days with the temperature hovering around 10 ? in the daytime , below zero at night . It differs in yet other ways : Most of the houses around the country are prototypes , designed to demonstrate how much solar homes can be like conventional houses . But not the ILS house .

On lmium gy di-chan-from ement tas a heat iary as a the be-the the the led. kes ure the ad-ur-ch ) C of a e-n-  | experiment , it 's our scratchpad , " says Reines . What do we need now ? The current technology works , but could be better , cheaper . Solar collectors , for example , have usually been built by soldering copper tubing onto copper sheets , then painting the whole thing black . " What we may be using is welded sheets of steel inflated with high-pressure nitrogen after the tube pattern has been created by the welding , " says John Yellott . " This has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks improvements will have to be made in heatstorage techniques . He also sees basically different techniques coming into use when buildings are being designed with solar heating in mind . Yellott and I were sitting on a concrete bench on the campus of Arizona State University one afternoon recently talking . " Take a look at that brick wall , " he said , pointing across the lawn . " If that wall were made of dark brick and covered with glass , we would be generating temperatures of 170 ? in there . All you 've got to do is let it flow inside . " What 's holding things up ? Until now , mostly cost . Solar collectors were relatively expensive and the systems experimental . Gas , oil , and coal were cheap and plentiful . There were other reasons . " Solar apparatus in the past has been so ugly , " says Yellot . " And when it has been tacked on to a house it looks just that way : tacked on . " In addition , many people resist change , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many studies these days are looking into the problem from every point of view . At the University of Delaware , for example , 16 departments contribute to the solar project . Involved are not only such expected experts as physicists , chemists , and engineers , but psychologists , economists , and architects . The cost problem may be fading into the past . " We 're just around the corner from economic feasibility , thanks to the Arabs , " says Yellott . Boer thinks we 've turned the corner . He estimates that his house would cost 10 percent more than a conventionally heated and cooled house ? but would easily save its cost in unused fuel . Dr. Farber estimates that his system in a totally heated and air-conditioned house @# would cost perhaps $5000 more than a conventional one . And Harold Hay estimates that the new equipment on his house would cost no more than the furnace and air conditioning systems it replaces . Whatever the case , the price problem is slowly fading away . And so is another that has kept solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of homes are built by developers . And developers are primarily interested in keeping first cost as low as possible . But that may be changing . In Phoenix last December , a large home builder was one of the principal sponsors of a seminar on solar heating . " He iaware that the next large tract he builds , " says Yellott , " he probably wo n't be able to get natural gas Maybe he 'll have to go to solar energy or heat pumps . But he 's got to find something new ? even if it costs more ? or he 's out of business . " The pressure to get solar housing in operation is growing . Fuel costs are high and still rising . And some people believe we should stop burning current fuels such as oil or gas even if they were available since they 're used to make everything from fertilizer to plastics . Nevertheless , some experts are skeptical . Dr. Hottel , who built the original MIT house 35 years ago . recently warned his colleagues not to lose their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real difficulties - of manufacturing working systemeconomically have not even been dealt with . He also points out that most of the work being done these days is aimed at the $40,000 and up upper-middle-income house , but that the real need is for designing good , inexpensive systems and houses wage earners can afford . But others are brushing aside such objections and are anxious to get started . " We have had more than enough paper studies already , " says Dr. Farber . " We have more than enough knowledge to build these things and put them into operation . " When will it happen ? Not everyone agrees , but here ' - one optimistic estimate : " Solar heating , three to five years from now , " says Boer . " Solar air conditioning , four to six years . And we 're given enough money , electric power from solar cells in a decade . Adds John Yellott : " The inexora forces of economics will bring a the age of solar energy .
