txt The upheaval in the Horn of Africa has taken two dramatic turns : ? In Ethiopia , in the third violent purge at the top since Emperor Haile Selassie was ousted , junta leader Mengistu Haile Mariam has executed his rival and No. 2 man , Lt. Col. Atnafu Abate . This is against the background of Colonel Mengistu 's struggle , with massive Soviet aid , to defend the old Ethiopian empire against Eritrean breakaway and Somali invasion . ? In Somalia , President Siad Barre , once a client of Moscow , has denounced his friendship treaty with the Soviet Union , withdrawn naval and air facilities hitherto enjoyed by the Russians , ordered Soviet military and civilian advisers to leave the country , and broken diplomatic relations with Cuba . All this because of Soviet and Cuban aid for Ethiopian Colonel Mengistu in the latter 's efforts to beat back the Somali-backed and Somali-armed " liberation " movement in the largely Somali-inbabited Ogaden region of Ethiopia . Until the spring of this year , Ethiopia ? even after the coup that ousted the Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military supplier . In the other camp , Somalia represented the Soviet Union 's earliest and biggest military investment in East Africa . Somali President Siad Barre would now like the West , and particularly the U.S. , to come to his help with arms to replace those lost in the fighting for " liberation " of Ogaden . But the U.S. prefers a policy of hands off in the dispute , having seen how President Siad Barre used the Soviet arms originally at his disposal to try to break up the old Ethiopian empire . General Siad Barre 's decision to break with Moscow came after 19 hours of debate in the Central Committee of the ruling Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party . The Somalis face stalemate in their fighting in Ogaden , stalled by the Ethiopians out // From page 1 Dramatic turns in the Horn of Africa side the ancient city of Harar . Denied help by the West and seeing the Soviets bolstering the Ethiopians for a counterattack , General Barre apparently had two choices : either ( 1 ) break with the Russians entirely because of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sympathetic to his cries for help ; or ( 2 ) come to terms with the Russians and join in a mooted Soviet plan for a Soviet-patronized confederation in the Horn , comprising at least Ethiopia , Somalia , and Eritrea . The announcement Nov. 13 from Mogadishu , the Somali capital , means the second course was rejected Whether the West will be more responsive to General Siad Barre 's appeals in the wake of his ouster of the Russians is doubtful . It might be more to the West 's advantage to leave the Russians to " stew " in the no-win situation into which they have gotten themselves in the Horn . The future of both the present Somali and Ethiopian leaders is questionable . The Ethiopians are getting Soviet . Cuban , and reportedly Israeli aid , the latter at the training or advisory level . But even if Colonel Mengistu manages to repel the Somalis , he could only add to Moscow 's embarrassment ? at least on his showing so far . His trouble goes back to his refusal to compromise with the Eritreans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not Somalia , could still be his undoing Interestingly , the executed Colonel Atnafu was recently in Eritrea ? where the battle is still going against the Ethiopians . Colonel Mengistu might well have decided to get rid of him because of his criticism of the Mengistu policies in Eritrea .
