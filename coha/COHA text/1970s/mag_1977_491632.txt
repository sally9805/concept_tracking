// 66 May/June ' 77 What is it like to die ? That is a question which humanity has been asking itself ever since there have been humans . I have had the opportunity to raise this question before a sizable number of audiences . These groups have ranged from classes in psychology , philos  --  ophy and sociology through church organ  --  izations , television audiences and civic clubs to professional societies of medi  --  cine . On the basis of this exposure , I can safely say that this topic excites the most powerful of feelings . Yet , despite all this interest it remains true that it is very difficult for most of us to talk about death . There are at least two reasons for this . One of them is primarily psychological and cultural : The subject of death is taboo . We feel , perhaps only sub  --  consciously , that to be in contact with death in any way , even indirectly , some  --  how confronts us with the prospect of our own deaths , draws our own deaths closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most medical students , myself included , have found that even the remote encounter with death which oc  --  curs upon one 's first visit to the anatomi  --  cal laboratories when entering medical school can evoke strong feelings of un  --  easiness . In my own case , the reason for this response now seems quite obvious . What I was seeing on that table was a symbol of my own mortality . In some way , if only preconsciously , the thought must have been in my mind , " That will happen to me , too . " Likewise , talking about death can be seen on the psychological level as another way of approaching it indirectly . No doubt many people have the feeling that to talk about death at all is in effect to conjure it up mentally , to bring it closer in such a way that one has to face up to the inevitability of one 's own eventual demise . So , to spare ourselves this psy  --  chological trauma , we decide just to try to avoid the topic as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dis  --  cuss death is more complicated , as it is rooted in the very nature of language it  --  self . For the most part , the words of hu  --  man language allude to things of which we have experience through our own physical senses . Death , though , is something which lies beyond the conscious experience of most of us because most of us have never been through it . If we are to talk about death at all , then , we must avoid both social taboos and the deep-seated linguistic dilemmas which derive from our own inexperience . What we often end up doing is talking in euphemistic analogies . We compare death or dying with more pleasant things in our experience , things with which we are familiar . Perhaps the most common analogy of this type is the comparison between death and sleep . Dying , we tell ourselves , is like going to sleep . This figure of speech oc  --  curs very commonly in everyday thought and language , as well as in the literature of many cultures and many ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of the ancient Greeks . In The Iliad , for example , Homer calls sleep " death 's sis  --  ter , " and Plato , in his dialogue The Apol  --  ogy , put the following words into the mouth of his teacher , Socrates , who has just been sentenced to death by an Athe  --  nian jury : " Now , if death is only a dreamless sleep , it must he a marvelous gain . I sup  --  pose that if anyone were told to pick out the night on which he slept so soundly as not even to dream , and then to compare it with all the other nights and days of his life , and then were told to say , after due consideration , how many better and hap  --  pier days and nights than this he had spent in the course of his life  --  well , I think that ... anyone would find these days and nights easy to count in compari  --  son with the rest . If death is like this , then , I call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at it in this way , can be regarded as no more than one single night . " This same analogy is embedded in our own contemporary language . Consider the phrase " to put to sleep . " If you present your dog to a veterinarian with the in  --  struction to put him to sleep , you would normally mean something very different than you would upon taking your wife or husband to an anesthesiologist with the same words . Others prefer a different , but related analogy . Dying , they say , is like forgetting . When one dies , one forgets all one 's woes ; all one 's painful and troubling memories are obliterated . As old and as widespread as they may be , however , both the " sleeping " and the " forgetting " analogies are ultimately in  --  adequate in so far as comforting us is con  --  cerned . Each is a different way of making the same assertion . Even though they tell us so in a somewhat more palatable way , both say , in effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . If this is so , then death really does n't have any of the desirable features of sleeping and forgetting . Sleeping is a positive , desirable experience in life be  --  cause waking follows it . A restful night 's sleep makes the waking hours following it more pleasant and productive . If waking did not follow it , the benefits of sleep would not be possible . Similarly , annihila  --  tion of all conscious experience implies not only the obliteration of all painful memories , but of all pleasant ones , too . So upon analysis , neither analogy is close enough to give us any real comfort or hope in facing death . There is another view , however , which disavows the notion that death is annihila  --  tion of consciousness . According to this other , perhaps more ancient tradition , some aspect of the human being survives even after the physical body ceases to function and is ultimately destroyed . This persistent aspect has been called by many names , among them psyche , soul , mind , spirit , self , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the notion that one passes into another realm of existence upon physical death is among the most venerable of human beliefs . There is a graveyard in Turkey which was used by Neanderthal men approximately 100,000 years ago . There , fossilized imprints have enabled archaeologists to discover that these ancient men buried their dead in biers of flowers , indicating that they per  --  haps saw death as an occasion of celebra  --  tion  --  as a transition of the dead from this world to the next . Indeed , graves from very early sites all over the earth give evi  --  dence of the belief in human survival of bodily death . In short , we are faced with two con  --  trasting answers to our original question about the nature of death , both of ancient derivation , yet both widely held even to  --  day . Some say that death is another dimension of reality . In what follows I do not wish in any way to dismiss either answer . I simply wish to give a report on a search which I have personally undertaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countered a large number of persons who were involved in what I shall call " near-death experiences . " I have met these per  --  sons in many ways . At first it was by co  --  incidence . In 1965 , when I was an under  --  graduate student studying philosophy at the University of Virginia , I met a man who was a clinical professor of psychiatry in the School of Medicine . I was struck from the beginning with his warmth , kind  --  liness and humor . It came as a great sur  --  prise when I later learned a very interest  --  ing fact about him , namely , that he had been dead  --  not just once but on two oc  --  casions , about ten minutes apart  --  and that he had given a most fantastic account of what happened to him while he was " dead . " I later heard him relate his story to a small group of interested students . At the time , I was most impressed , but since I had little background from which to judge such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my mind and in the form of a tape recording of his talk . Some years later , after I had received my Ph.D . in philosophy , I was teaching in a university in eastern North Carolina . In one course I had my students read Plato 's Phaedo , a work in which immortality is among the subjects discussed . In my lec  --  tures I had been emphasizing the other doctrines which Plato presents there and had not focused upon the discussion of life after death . After class one day a stu  --  dent stopped by to see me . He askedwhether we might discuss the subject of immortality . He had an interest in the subject because his grandmother had " died " during an operation and had re  --  counted a very amazing experience . I asked him to tell me about it , and much to my surprise , he related almost the same series of events which I had heard the psychiatry professor describe some years before . At this time any search for cases be  --  came a bit more active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human survival of biological death in my philoso  --  phy courses . However , I was careful not to mention the two death experiences in my courses . I adopted , in effect , a wait  --  and-see attitude . If such reports were fair  --  ly common , I thought , I would probably hear of more if I just brought up the general topic of survival in philosophical discussions , expressed a sympathetic atti  --  tude toward the question , and waited . To my amazement , I found that in almost every class of thirty or so students , at least one student would come to me after  --  ward and relate a personal near-death experience . What has amazed me since the begin  --  ning of my interest are the great sim  --  ilarities in the reports , despite the fact that they come from people of highly varied religious , social and educational backgrounds . By the time I entered med  --  ical school in 1972 , I had collected a siz  --  able number of these experiences and I began mentioning the informal study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eventually , a friend of mine talked me into giving a report to a medical society , and other public talks followed . Again , I found that after every talk someone would come up to tell me of an experience of his own . As I became more widely known for this interest , doctors began to refer to me persons whom they had resuscitated and who reported unusual experiences . Still others have written to me with reports after newspaper articles about my studies appeared . At the present time , I know of approx  --  imately 150 cases of this phenomenon . The experiences which I have studied fall into three categories : ( 1 ) The experiences of persons who were resuscitated after having been thought , adjudged or pronounced clini  --  cally dead by their doctors . ( 2 ) The experiences of persons who , in the course of accidents or severe injury or illness , came very close to physical death . ( 3 ) The experiences of persons who , as they died , told them to other people who were present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content of the death experi  --  ence to me . From the vast amount of material that could be derived from 150 cases , selection obviously has occurred . Some of it has been purposeful . For example , although I have found reports of the third type to complement and to agree very well with experiences of the first two types , I have for the most part dropped them from con  --  consideration for two reasons . First , it helps to reduce the number of cases studied to a more manageable level , and second , it en  --  ables me to stick as close as possible to firsthand reports . Thus , I have interviewed in great detail some fifty persons upon whose experiences I am able to report . Of these , the cases of the first type ( those in which an apparent clinical death actually occurs ) are certainly more dramatic than those of the second type ( in which only a close brush with death occurs ) . Indeed , whenever I have given public talks on this phenomenon , the " death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accounts in the press have sometimes been written so as to suggest they are the only type of case with which I have dealt . Despite the wide variation in the cir  --  cumstances surrounding close calls with death and in the types of persons under  --  going them , it remains true that there is a striking similarity among the accounts of the experiences themselves . In fact , the similarities among various reports are so great that one can easily pick out about fifteen separate elements which recur again and again in the mass of narratives that I have collected . On the basis of these points of likeness , let me now construct a brief , theoretically " ideal " or " complete " experience which embodies all of the common elements , in the order in which Continued on page 82 who have already died , and a loving , warm spirit of a kind he has never encountered before  --  a being of light  --  appears before him . This being asks him a question , nonverbally , to make him evaluate his life and helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantaneous playback of the major events of his life . At some point he finds himself approaching some sort of barrier or border , appar ently representing the limit between earthly life and the next life . Yet , he finds that he must go back to the earth , that the time for his death has not yet come . At this point he resists , for by now he is taken up with his experiences in the afterlife and does not want to re  --  turn . He is overwhelmed by intense feelings of joy , love and peace . Despite his atti  --  tude , though , he somehow reunites with his physical body and lives . Later he tries to tell others , but he has trouble doing so . In the first place , he can find no human words adequate to describe these unearthly episodes . He also finds that others scoff so he stops telling other people . Still , the ex  --  perience affects his life pro  --  foundly , especially his views about death and its relationship to life . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tive is not meant to be a representation of any one person 's experience . Rath  --  er , it is a " model , " a com  --  posite of the common ele  --  ments found in very many stories . I introduce it here only to give a preliminary , general idea of what a per  --  son who is dying may ex  --  perience . Since it is an ab  --  straction rather than an ac  --  tual account , I will discuss in detail each common ele  --  ment , giving many exam  --  ples . Before doing that , how  --  ever , a few facts need to be set out in order to put the remainder of my exposi  --  tion of the experience of dying into the proper framework . ( 1 ) Despite the striking similarities among various accounts , no two of them are precisely identical ( though a few come re markably close to it ) . ( 2 ) I have found no one person who reports every single component of the composite experience . Very many have reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fifteen or so ) and a few have reported up to twelve . ( 3 ) There is no one ele ment of the composite experience which every single person has report  --  ed to me , which crops up in every narrative . Nonetheless , a few of these elements come fairly close to being universal . ( 4 ) There is not one component of my abstract model which has ap  --  peared in only one account . Each element has shown up in many sepa  --  rate stories . ( 5 ) The order in which a dying person goes through the various stages briefly delineated above may vary from that given in my " theoreti  --  cal model . " To give one example , various persons have reported seeing the " being of light " before , or at the same time , they left their physical bodies , and not as in the " model , " some time afterward . However , the order in which the stages occur in the model is a very typical order , and wide variations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  cal complete experience a dying per  --  son gets seems to depend on whether or not the person actually under  --  went an apparent clinical death , and if so , on how long he was in this state . In general , persons who were " dead " seem to report more florid , complete experiences than those who only came close to death , and those who were " dead " for a longer period go deeper than those who were " dead " for a shorter time . ( 7 ) I have talked to a few people who were pronounced dead , resusci  --  tated and came back reporting none pect that they would have some lin  --  guistic difficulties in expressing what happened to them . In fact , this is precisely the case . The persons in  --  volved uniformly characterize their experiences as ineffable , that is , " in  --  expressible . " Many people have made remarks to the effect that , " There are just no words to express what I am trying to say , " or " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe this . " One woman put this to me very succinctly when she said : " Now , there is a real problem for me as I 'm trying to tell you this , because all the words I know are three-di  --  mensional . As I was going through this , I kept thinking , ' Well , when I was taking geometry , they always told me there were only three dimen  --  sions , and I always just accepted that . But they were wrong . There are more . ' And , of course , our world  --  the one we 're living in now  --  is three-dimensional , but the next one defin  --  itely is n't . And that 's why it 's so hard to tell you this . I have to de  --  scribe it to you in words that are three-dimensional . That 's as close as I can get to it , but it 's not really adequate . I ca n't really give you a complete picture . " Numerous people have told of hearing their doctors or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman related to me , " I was in the hospital , but they did n't know what was wrong with me . So Dr. James , my doctor , sent me down  --  stairs to the radiologist for a liver scan so they could find out . First , they tested this drug they were going to use on my arm , since I had a lot of drug allergies . But there was no re  --  action , so they went ahead . When they used it this time , I arrested on them , I heard the radiologist who was working on me go over to the telephone , and I heard very clearly as he dialed it . I heard him say , ' Dr. James , I 've killed your patient , Mrs. Martin . ' And I knew I was n't dead . I tried to move or to let them know , but I could n't . When they were try  --  ing to resuscitate me , I could hear them telling how many c.c. ' s of something to give me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt noth  --  ing at all when they touched me . " In another case , a woman who had previously had several episodes of heart trouble was seized with a heart attack , during which she nearly lost her life . She says , " Suddenly , I was gripped by squeezing chest pains , just as though an iron band had been clamped quickly around the middle part of my chest and tightened . My husband and a friend of ours heard me fall and came run  --  ning in to help me . I found myself in a deep blackness , and through it I heard my husband , as if he were at a great distance , saying , ' This is it , this time ! ' And my thoughts were , ' Yes , it is . ' " A young man who was thought dead following an automobile acci  --  dent says , " I heard a woman who was there say , ' Is he dead ? ' and // someone else said , ' Yeah , he 's dead . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors and others present remember . For exam  --  ple , one doctor told me , " A woman patient of mine had a cardiac arrest just before another surgeon and I were to operate on her . I was right there , and I saw her pupils dilate . We tried for some time to resuscitate her , but were n't having any success , so I thought she was gone . I told the other doctor who was working with me , ' Let 's try one more time and then we 'll give up . ' This time , we got her heart beating , and she came around . Later , I asked her what she remembered of her ' death . ' She said she did n't remember much about it , except that she did hear me say . Let 's try one more time and then we 'll give up . ' " Many people describe ex  --  tremely pleasant feelings and sensations during the early stages of their experiences . After a severe head injury , one man 's vital signs were un @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of injury there was a momentary flash of pain , but then all the pain vanish  --  ed . I had the feeling of float  --  ing in a dark space . The day was bitterly cold , yet while I was in that blackness all I felt was warmth and the most ex  --  treme comfort I have ever ex  --  perienced .. . . I remember thinking , ' I must be dead . ' " A woman who was resus  --  citated after a heart attack remarks , " I began to experi  --  ence the most wonderful feelings . I could n't feel a thing in the world except peace , comfort , ease  --  just quietness . I felt that all my troubles were gone , and I thought to myself , ' Well , how quiet and peaceful , and I do n't hurt at all . ' " Another man recalls , " I just had a nice , great feeling of solitude and peace .... It was beautiful , and I was at such peace in my mind . " A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as he was hit he felt " a great attitude of relief . There was no pain , and I 've never felt so relaxed . I was at ease and it was all good . " Often people have the sensation of being pulled very rapidly through a dark space of some kind . Many different words are used to describe this space . I have heard this space described as a cave , a well , a trough , an enclosure , a tunnel , a funnel , a vacuum , a void , a sewer , a valley and a cylinder . Although people use dif  --  ferent terminology here , it is clear that they are all trying to express some one idea . Let us look at one account in which the " tunnel " fig  --  ures prominently : " This happened to me when I was a little boy  --  nine years old . That was twenty-seven years ago , but it was sostriking that I have never forgotten it . One afternoon I became very sick , and they rushed me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cided they were going to have to put me to sleep , but why I do n't know , because I was too young . Back in those days they used ether . They gave it to me by putting a cloth over my nose , and when they did , I was told afterward , my heart stopped beating , 1 did n't know at that time that that was exactly what happened to me , but anyway when this hap  --  pened I had an experience . Well , the first thing that happened  --  now I am going to describe it just the way I felt  --  was that I had this ringing noise brrrnn ng-brrrnnng-brrrn ring very rhythmic . Then I was moving through this  --  you 're going to think this is weird  --  through this long dark place . It seemed like a sewer or some  --  thing . I just ca n't describe it to you . I was moving , beating , all the time with this noise , this ringing noise . " It is a truism that most of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies . We grant , of course , that we have " minds , " too . But to most people our " minds " seem much more ephemeral than our bodies . The " mind , " after all , might be no more than the effect of the electrical and chemical activity which takes place in the brain , which is a part of the physical body . For many people it is an impossible task even to conceive of what it would be like to exist in any other way than in the physical body to which they are accustomed . Prior to their experiences , the persons T have interviewed were not , as a group , any different from the average person with respect to this attitude . That is why , after his rapidpassage through the dark tunnel , a dying person often has such an over  --  whelming surprise . For , at this point he may find himself looking upon his own physical body from a point out  --  side of it , as though he were " a spec  --  tator " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching figures and events " onstage in a play " or " in a movie . " Let us look now at a portion of an account in which this uncanny out-of-the-body episode is de  --  scribed : " I was seventeen years old and my brother and I were working at an amusement park . One afternoon , we decided to go swimming , and there were quite a few of the other young people who went in with us . Some  --  one said , Let 's swim across the lake . ' I had done that on numerous occa sions , but that day for some reason , I went down , almost in the middle of the lake ? ? I kept bobbling up and down , and all of a sudden , it felt as though I were away from my body , away from everybody , in space by myself . Although I was stable , stay  --  ing at the same level , I saw my body in the water about three or four feet away , bobbling up and down . I viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . I still felt as though I had an entire body form , even while I was outside my body . I had an airy feeling that 's almost in  --  describable . I felt like a feather . " Quite a few have told me that at some point while they were dying  --  sometimes early in the experience , sometimes only after other events had taken place  --  they became aware of the presence of other sphi tual be  --  ings in their vicinity , beings who ap  --  parently were there to ease them through their transition into death , or , in two cases , to tell them thattheir time to die had not yet come and that they must return to their physical bodies : One man remembers : " Several weeks before I nearly died , a good friend of mine , Bob , had been killed . Now the moment I got out of my body I had the feeling that Bob was standing there , right next to me . I could see him in my mind and felt like he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him as his physical body . I could see things , but not in the physical form , yet just as clearly , his looks , everything . Does that make sense ? He was there but he did n't have a physical body . It was kind of like a clear body , and I could sense every part of it  --  arms , legs and so on  --  but I was n't seeing it physically . I did n't think about it being odd at the time because I did n't really need to see him with my eyes . I did n't have eyes , anyway . " I kept asking him , Bob , where do I go now ? What has happened ? Am I dead or not ? ' And he never answered me , never said a word . But , often , while I was in the hos  --  pital , he would be there , and I would ask him again , What 's going on ? , ' but never any answer . And then the day the doctors said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . I did n't see him again and did n't feel his presence . It was almost as though he were waiting until I passed that final frontier and then he would tell me , would give me the details on what was going on . " In other cases , the spirits people encounter are not persons whom they knew in physical life . One woman told of seeing during her out  --  of-body experience not only her own transparent spiritual body but also another one , that of another person who had died very recently . She did not know who this per  --  son was , but made the very interest  --  ing remark that " I did not see this person , this spirit , as having any par  --  ticular age , at all . I did n't even have any sense of time myself . " In a very few instances , people have come to believe that the beings they encountered were their " guard . ian spirits . " One man was told by such a spirit , " I have helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going to turn you over to others . " A woman told me that as she was leaving her body she detect  --  ed the presence of two other spir  --  itual beings there , and that they identified themselves as her " spir  --  itual helpers . " In two very similar cases , persons told me of hearing a voice which told them that they were not dead yet , but that they must go back . As one of them tells it , " I heard a voice , not a man 's voice , but like a hearing be  --  yond the physical senses , telling me what I had to do  --  go back  --  and I felt no fear of getting back into my physical body . " Obviously , all the persons with whom I have talked had to " come back " at some point in their experi  --  ence . Usually , though , an interesting change in their attitude had taken place by this time . Remember that the most common feelings reported in the first few moments following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and an intense regret over one 's demise . However , once the dying person reaches a cer  --  tain depth in his experience , he does not want to come back , and he may even resist the return to the body . This is especially the case for those who have gotten so far as to encoun  --  ter the being of light . As one man put it , most emphatically , " I never want  --  ed to leave the presence of this being . " Exceptions to this generalization are often only apparent , not real . Several women who were mothers of young children at the time of their experience have told me that , while for themselves they would have pre  --  ferred to stay where they were , they felt an obligation to try to go back and to raise their children : " I wondered whether I should stay there , but as I did I remembered my family , my three children and my husband . Now , this is the part that is hard to get across : When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that light , I really did n't want to come back . But I take my responsibilities very seriously , and I knew that I had a duty to my family . So I decided to try to come back . " In several other cases , persons have told me that , though they were comfortable and secure in their new disembodied existence and were even enjoying it , they felt happy to be able to return to physical life since they had left some important task undone . In a few cases , this has taken the form of a desire to com  --  plete an unfinished education : " I had completed three years of college and had only one more year to go . I kept thinking , ' I do n't want to die now . ' But I feel that if this had gone on just a few minutes more , if I had been with this light for just a little while longer , 1 would n't have thought of my education anymore , that I would 've been taken up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have collected present an extremely varied picture when it comes to the question of the mode of return to physical life and of why the return took place . Most say simply that they do not know how or why they returned , or that they can only make guesses . A few very definitely feel that their own decisions to get back to the body and to return to earthly life were the operative factors . Typically , the moods and feelings which were associated with the ex  --  perience linger on for some time after the actual medical crisis has been resolved . ( 1 ) " After I came back , I cried off and on for about a week because I had to live in this world after seeing that one . I did n't want to come back . " ( 2 ) " When I came back , I brought with me some of the won  --  derful feelings I had over there . They lasted for several days . Even now I feel them sometimes . " ( 3 ) " This feeling was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a way . I 've never forgotten it . I still think about it very often . " No one that I interviewed has re  --  ported coming out of this experience feeling morally " purified " or per  --  fected . No one with whom I have talked in any way evinces a " holier-than-thou " attitude . In fact , most have specifically brought up the point that they feel that they are still trying , still searching . Their vision left them with new goals , new moral principles , and a renewed determina  --  tion to try to live in accordance with them , but with no feelings of instan  --  taneous salvation or of moral infal  --  libility. r continued from page 63 But the work/fun of writing and recording is secondary to perform  --  ing .

" When the group 's second album appeared in 1970 , rock critics prais  --  ed it for its virtuosity . When their next album appeared in 1971 , those same rock critics thumbed their noses at Chicago for becoming " commercial , " for appealing to large masses of people . " Short story here , " says Para  --  zaider . " I went to a record store in Los Angeles recently with my daugh  --  ter . The guy behind the counter had been playing guitar for ten years but he was still the guy behind the coun  --  ter . Young couple walks in . ' What new albums are out ? ' they ask . ' The new Boz Scaggs , ' says the clerk . ' Far out , ' the kids say . ' The new Chicago album is out too , ' the clerk says . ' Oh yeah ? ' say the kids . ' How 's that ?

If it was n't , you 'd be out of a job . ' " Unfavorable reviews bother Para  --  zaider . " It 's like ' let 's knock Chicago , let 's knock a winner , ' " he says . " But ! do n't know how you can knock something that a lot of people seem to appreciate and enjoy . When people criticize us , whether they realize it or not , they really hurt our feelings . We are not here to be run  --  ning around on the road for seven years to buy gold brick castles . We 're here because we love it . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insists Pankow . " If the audience is a drag , we 're going to be a drag too . See , they 're performing too . Little do they know , but they 're performing for us . When I 'm up there , I 'm watching a show . " Let 's face it , " says Parazaider , " a rock concert is an event . You buy some new jeans , a new shirt , you go out with your girl and you want to have a good time . Which is great . It 's a great way to get people together . " The members of Chicago are not ready to retire after ten years in rock and roll  --  half the life-span of that billion-dollar industry : " We could go on indefinitely , like Count Basic , " says Terry Kath . " I hope we 'll continue playing for quite a while . " says Robert Lamm . And Peter Cetera says , " This group will be around as long as we 're living . " " We can last as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chicago has been my life for the last decade . We 'll always be trying to be happy . All 1 want to do is be happy . When I die , I hope God forgives me for all the stuff I 've pulled off , all the stuff that comes with just being human . But after we 're long gone . the great  --  est contribution we could have made is to have our music last . My only concern is that I did my best . I left something that 's worthwhile . " That swaggering logo of Chicago 's is a registered trademark . On the cov  --  er of their second album , it was carv  --  ed into steel . It was sewn on a flag for their third , beveled into mahogany for their fifth , tooled into leather for their seventh , molded into chocolate for their tenth . Playing with that twenty-five-pound bar in Cartier 's recently , it seemed likely  --  and highly ap  --  propriate  --  that that familiar logo will next appear in platinum .
