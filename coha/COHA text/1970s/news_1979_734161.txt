txt President Carter and Congress return to the capital this weekend after a 10-day absence , having tested the mood of America . The nation 's mood , so far as can be judged by reports from early arrivals , is confused , anxious , and sullen . It is a no-win prospect for many politicians . These issues await their attention : SALT H : President Carter has been promising Americans a SALT II agreement with the Soviets " in a few days " for almost six months , and once again it seems momentary . The Senate sees in SALT one of the most important debates in a generation , a debate that could be divisive for Congress and the nation . New progress has been made in the SALT negotiations and a US-Soviet summit meeting may be announced within days , according to well-placed administration officials ? reports Monitor diplomatic correspondent Daniel Southerlandl Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Soviet Ambassador Anatoly F. Dobrynin were expected to meet on the evening of April 19 to discuss SALT , and State Department officials said a further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the second Vance-Dobrynin meeting could well set the stage for a summit conference in Europe between President Carter and Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev . Energy : The American public has had two weeks to absorb Mr. Carter 's sweeping program to phase out domestic oil price controls , starting in June , and to tax oil corporation " windfall profits . " Wide confusion seems to exist ; some segments of the public attack Mr. Carter for going too far , others for not going far enough ; many are not sure there is any shortage at all . Meanwhile , prices at the fuel pump edge toward a dollar a gallon . Inflation : This remains the most emotional issue , accentuated by the April 15 income-tax bite . Demands continue that Congress " do something , " reinforced by taunts that Congress is increasing its own income , perquisites , and travel allowances . Mr. Carter 's voluntary guidelines are a frequent target . The economy : Economists seem as divided as the man in the street over what is happening . G. William Miller , chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy is slowing and appears opposed to applying the credit brakes . By contrast , Arthur F. Burns , former Fed chairman , and Herbert Stein , Nixon-Ford economic adviser , this week warned here against explosive inflation and urged strong action to restrain a boom . The latest monthly US figures on personal income and housing starts // From a e 1 Carter , Congress , and US mood : a glum , anxious public watches show increases . It remains unclear whether the nation is headed for continued expansion or a recession . Because of these unsettling factors , returning congressmen see no-win situations in Washington everywhere they look . Not in recent history has a new session of Congress passed so little legislation as the present one ? and this with one party , the Democrats , overwhelmingly in control of Congress and in the White House . For once Congress is making news by doing little . Legislators insist that is just what constituents want : less regulation , less restriction , less federal interference . In one respect , things have taken a turn for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic " dollar-rescue operation " on the international exchange markets . Officials here argued that the dollar was being oversold abroad . On April 18 , the Treasury here announced that it will cut in half the size of its monthly gold sales , from 1.5 million ounces to 750,000 ounces , because of the dollar 's recovery . Since the end of 1978 the dollar has risen more than 10 percent against the German mark , 18 percent against the Swiss franc , and a surprising 22 percent against the Japanese yen . This seemed to be one crisis that is over . The present go-slow Congress is expected to continue to mark time on anti-inflation programs . Democrats rejected last year 's Kemp-Roth proposal to reduce federal taxes by one-third over three years , and sponsors seem unlikely to revive it . The proposal to write an amendment into the US Constitution for a mandatory balanced budget has been likened to the Prohibition Amendment , enacted in the 1920s and later repealed . Congress is thought unlikely to take such drastic action for a while .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
