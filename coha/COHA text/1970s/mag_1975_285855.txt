Over the past ten years , Tom Wolfe has set himself up as the Bugs Bunny of American journalism-a squeaky , impudent dandy with a glib eye for the lumbering victim . Toward the end of the ' 60s , New York appeared to be strewn with his targets , from rich Black Panther-loving liberals to the editorial staff of The New Yorker . It was also dotted with the lucky recipients of his approval : mayflies like Baby Jane Holzer , cultish ephemerids like Marshall McLuhan and social grotesques like the collector-exhibitionists Robert and Ethel Scull , all festooned in yards of Wolfe 's glittery , incontinent prose . He was the compleat ' 60s fashion plate , so much a part of the hustling , celebrity-obsessed triviality of the time that even now he can hardly be detached from it-a sort of two-dimensional Cocteau , with the poetry subtracted . <P> Wolfe 's eye for social foible was mean and exact ; his sense of ideas almost nonexistent . He had ( and still has ) one obsessive theme : the unease of the arrived white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the hustles wrought on them from below . That was the motif of his last book , Radical Chic &; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers ( 1970 ) . It also supplies the comedy of manners for his new one , The Painted Word , which appeared in Harper 's April issue and has now been published in hard cover by Farrar , Straus and Giroux . The book was meant to be a scathing indictment of modern art in general and of American painting and its social milieu in particular . Instead , it emerges as a curious document of frustration : the dandy as Archie Bunker . <P> " All these years , " Wolfe asserts with his customary hyperbole , " I , like so many others , have stood in front of a thousand , two thousand , God-knows-how-many thousand Pollocks , de Koonings , Newmans , Nolands , Rothkos , Rauschenbergs , Judds , Johnses ... waiting , waiting , forever waiting for ... it ... for it to come into focus , namely , the visual reward for so much effort which must be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could never have been there , and anyone who thought it was - whether artist , critic , collector or onlooker-was either a patsy or a fraud . <P> The New York art world , especially in its present decay , is the easiest target a pop sociologist could ask for . Most of it is a wallow of egotism , social climbing and power brokerage , and the only thing that makes it tolerable is the occasional reward of experiencing a good work of art in all its richness , complexity and difficulty . Take the art from the art world , as Wolfe does , and the matrix becomes fit for caricature . Since Wolfe is unable to show any intelligent response to painting , caricature is what we get : a rehashed conspiracy theory . <P> Svengalis and Status . All American artists , Wolfe argues , are Trilbys . For the past 30 years they have been hypnotized by three powerful critics named Harold Rosenberg , Clement Greenberg and Leo Steinberg . These Svengalis have dictated what shall be painted and sculpted . From abstract expressionism onward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories . The works are then fobbed off on a public of bourgeois status seekers who strive to soothe their guilt at being rich and successful by patronizing the New . Such is the gist of Wolfe 's pamphlet . If it seems familiar , that is only because Wolfe did not invent philistinism .
