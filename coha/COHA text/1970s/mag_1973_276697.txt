When an investor wants to buy shares in a typical mutual fund , he goes to one of the fund 's own salesmen or to a broker who has been designated by the fund as its agent . For his services , which may include counseling but often consist of no more than filling out a form and mailing it in to the fund , the salesman or broker-agent is rewarded with the sweetest commission in the securities industry : an average of 8% to 8.5% of the total purchase price , compared with an average of 1.45% on trades in corporate stocks such as General Motors and U.S. Steel . <P> Last week the Justice Department declared that this arrangement-which mutual funds have for years argued is essential to their ability to market their products-violates antimonopoly laws , and filed suit in federal court to break it up . Three of the country 's largest mutual funds were named as defendants . So were the National Association of Securities Dealers , many of whose 4,200 broker members act as fund agents , and nine major brokerage houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bache &; Co. and Paine , Webber , Jackson &; Curtis . <P> In effect , the suit asks that mutual fund shares be traded exactly like corporate stocks . A customer , in the Justice Department 's view , should be able to pick up the phone , call any broker he chooses , and put in an order to buy , say , 100 shares of any fund he selects . The broker would then match his order with the offer of someone who wants to sell 100 shares ( at present , mutual fund shares are nearly always sold back to the fund itself ) and execute a trade at standard commission rates . <P> How such a trading market in mutual fund shares would actually work , if the courts eventually order one into existence , is something of a mystery . The price gyrations of the regular stock market , which are ruled by investors ' shifting expectations of future profits , would seem to be impossible in a market for mutual fund shares . Funds are obligated by law to buy back their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fund 's net assets . No seller would offer his shares at a discount in the trading market if he could sell them to the fund " at net . " Nor would any buyer pay a premium to purchase shares from a private seller if the funds continued their present practice of offering new shares at a price determined by asset value . Indeed , Justice Department officials expect that mutual fund shares would trade at prices no different from those set under the present system . The only difference would be lower commissions .
