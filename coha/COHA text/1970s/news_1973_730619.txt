txt Ex-Chicagoan remembers 1967 yule cheer ' for corrupt cops Many facets of the Chicago police scandal have been explored to date , but none has focused on the personal tragedy endured by some of tile victims of police extortion . This is the second of four exclusive reports outlining the unrelenting demands of crooked policemen . By Bob Wiedrich Tower Ticker columnist Chicago Tribune Press Service PHOENIX , Ariz. , Jan. 14 ? Louis F. King , the former Austin District saloon keeper defrocked by crooked Chicago cops , will never forget that Christmas of 1J67 when it cost him $300 in fancy liquor to keep his regular crew of police extortionists In a holiday mood . Several weeks earlier , King was tending bar at The Scene , a tavern he had purchased less then a month earlier on Chicago 's West Side , when a quartet of Austin vice detectives dropped in for a drink ? naturally a free one . These fellows were talking freely about what other tavern owners in the district were giving as gifts to . someone they , loosely characterized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capt . Mark Thanasouras was commander of the Austin Police District , where the operation of a $100 a month club police extortion Yule , 1967 , not merry for shakedown victim // racket was just getting into high gear . NEARLY FIVE years later , a host of policemen would be indicted and convicted of the tavern shakedowns . But at this time , ' twos the season to be merry . And the Austin District 's merry men were on the prowl . King , who last year became a federal government witness in the Chicago police scandal and lives near this resort and retirement community , recalls the events of that night this way : " What are you gon na give ? " inquired one of the policemen . " Stop in , " King replied . " I 'll have something for him . " Then another gentleman with a gun and a star chimed in : " What about us ? " " WELL , THAT Christmas cost me three hundred bucks in fancy booze , " King said in a series of exclusive interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other payoffs I had to make . " I assembled the finest Greek brandy , the finest liqueurs , and the finest scotch , figuring that maybe if I drowned them in the stuff , they 'd leave me alone . " Anyway , a couple of days before Christmas- one of the vice detectives parked his unmarked squad car illegally by a fire hydrant in front of The Scene and came in . Then I had to suffer the indignity of helping him lug out to the car two cases of my own booze . " King recalls the trunk of the squad car was already so filled with Christmas loot from other taverns there was barely room enough left for the twoway radio equipment . " WOULD YOU believe that bum wished me a Merry Christmas ? " King said . King had been operating the Question Mark , ' another tavern at 6918 W. Grand Ave . in the Austin District ) , for about six months , when he decided to buy The Scene . By then , he was already well acquainted , with police shakedowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after having paid off $500 to obtain police approval of his license application , then got 36th Ward Ald. John F. Aiello to intercede in his behalf in getting a 4 o'clock license for the tavern . " I got that 4 o'clock license Louis King without , it . costing me three cents in payoffs , " King said . " Aid . Aiello said it was a favor to my father . " King 's father is Ben King , a former Cook County deputy sheriff and Democratic precinct captain now retired and living in California . " LATER , THO , the ward organization did send men around to sell ads in the ward book at fifty bucks a crack , but that was the extent of it , " King said . " Once I sent them a check for only $25 and that was returned with the message it was n't enough . I did n't give them anything after that . By that time , - it was 1970 and I had been shaken so many times I had had it . " The night King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came there with his wife , spending some of the money he had extorted earlier from King . But later , soon after King had been issued a 4 o'clock license , the same vice detective stopped by before the tavern bad opened for the evening and said , " You owe us money . " " For what ? " King asked . " How did you get your 4 o'clock license ? " was the reA . ' . " You had nothing to do with it , " King told the crooked cop . " We 're gon na get even with you , " was the policeman 's threatening retort . " I GOT MAD , " King said . " I told him he could drop dead . I told him , ' You 're not getting one more cent out of melt " The vice detective left . Then the harassment started . First , the customers stinted getting parking tickets practically every night of the week , usually after 2 a. m. when King 's business was at its best . Then the vicemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week to check the identification of people in a place that rarely had had a customer under 25 , King said . " They came in ' at various times and threatened me with arrest for supposedly violating the city law that requires a clear view into a tavern from the street , " he continued . " THEY CLAIMED our drapes were n't open wide enough or that a cloak rack by the window was obscuring the view . They did everything possible to harass The .. It went on for more than a month . " Naturally , the customers did n't like the aggravation of the parking tickets and the ID checks . They did n't like the cops coming in all the time ; Some of them started taking their ? business elsewhere . " THEN ONE day one of the Austin vice men , came in and introduced himself and King got the Word . " Why do n't you pay so much a month and avoid this crap ? " King says the policeman suggested . " I was getting hep by then to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I asked , ' What 's the mutuals ? ' " " You tell me , " the vice detective replied . " How about $50 a month ? " King offered . The vice man grimaced . " THAT 'S ALL I really can afford , " King told him . " I 've been thru quite a bit . " The policeman thought awhile . Then ho said , " All right . " But King soon learned that the payment of monthly tribute only stopped the harassment and possibility ' of arrest on trumped up charges . If some other form of trouble arose in the saloon , that cost extra . King still had ' a lot to learn about police corruption in Chicago . Tomorrow : King becomes a full fledged member of the $100-a-month club .
