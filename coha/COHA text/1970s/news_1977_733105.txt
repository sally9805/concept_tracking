txt The historic highest-level meeting in decades between the United States and South Africa got off to a start like a chess game between grandmasters . When South African Prime Minister John Vorster emerged from the first round of talks in the Hofburg Palace in Vienna , he simply smiled at newsmen . U.S. Vice-President Walter Mondale was asked by the newsmen how the talks were going . His reply : " Continuing . " Each man needs something of the other . Mr. Mondale , spokesman in Vienna for the Carter administration 's new , more active African policies , wants , in this order : ? South Africa 's cooperation in moving South African-run Namibia ( South-West Africa ) to majority rule as soon as possible under constitutional arrangements more acceptable to African and world opinion than those hitherto proposed . ? South Africa 's help in getting Rhodesia 's white minority Prime Minister Ian Smith to agree to black majority rule in his country by the end of 1978 . ? South Africa 's willingness to modify its own race policies at home and accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mondale diplomatically put it the other day . Mr. Vorster wants : ? American recognition of a community of interest between South Africa and the U.S. , not only to lessen the isolation which has for so long been South Africa 's lot in world affairs // rom page 1 U.S. , S. Africa : high stakes but also to secure a measure of cooperation in defense planning . ? American acceptance of the South African perception that southern Africa and the supertanker sea routes around it are a primary target of Soviet and Communist scheming and covetousness . ? American soft-pedaling of incipient efforts by the Carter administration to influence South African race policies at home toward the " full participation " of which Mr. Mondale has spoken . There has been careful orchestration of the U.S. approach to the Mondale-Vorster meeting . President Carter and U.S. Ambassador to the UN Andrew Young have talked tough . But as Mr. Mondale got closer to the meeting with Mr. Vorster , the Vice-President seemed to be going out of his way not to be abrasive . Not only did he carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority rule " ? which has emotional overtones for white South Africans ? but he also went on record as saying that he did not see his encounter with Mr. Vorster as " a confrontation . " This was a softening counterpoint to what President Carter said in California May 17 : that Mr. Mondale would tell Mr. Vorster , " If you do n't do something about Namibia , we 'll take strong action against you in the United Nations . " ( Presumably the President was suggesting that the U.S. would no longer use its veto in the Security Council to block international sanctions against South Africa . ) The South Africans have almost certainly come to Vienna feeling they have a strong case . They can be expected to offer continued cooperation on Namibia and South Africa and even to provide the U.S. side with information on what the Vorster government is doing and proposes to do to remove some of the sharp edges of its race policy at home . And as they face Mr. Mondale , they can comfort themselves with the thought that the steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has brought in revenues making South Africa less immediately vulnerable to economic pressure than it was . This probably buoyed Mr. Vorster and his new Foreign Minister , R. F. Botha , in their insistence that they were not going to let outsiders lecture them . But whatever the South Africans offer Mr. Mondale , the question is : Will it be enough ? Not simply enough for the U.S. , but enough for southern Africa 's black nationalists . Because of South Africa 's longstanding desperate need to be accepted by the U.S. , Mr. Vorster can be expected to go a long way to satisfy Mr. Mondale on both Namibia and Rhodesia . After all , in sitting across the table from Mr. Vorster in the Hofburg Palace , the U.S. Vice-President is the most valuable symbol of acceptance to be won so far . But when it comes to race policies within South Africa itself , the respective perceptions are so wide apart that it is difficult to see how they can be bridged.               @ @ @ @ @ @
