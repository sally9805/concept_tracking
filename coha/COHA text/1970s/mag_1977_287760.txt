In its constant skirmishing with companies , the Environmental Protection Agency last week won its biggest victory yet in a water-pollution case . After five years of litigation , U.S. Steel Corp . agreed to stop dumping cyanide , ammonia and phenols-all toxic pollutants-into Lake Michigan and the Grand Calumet River from its huge works at Gary , Ind . It has been pumping out 16,700 Ibs. a day of solids , part of them toxic . <P> In a negotiated truce with the EPA , the company also consented to pay $3.45 million in fines for violating federal and state water-and air-pollution standards . <P> Further , U.S. Steel pledged to spend $70 million to equip the Gary works with new water-pollution-control equipment , and $1 million to pay for research on water-treatment systems and the impact of dissolved solids on Lake Michigan . <P> EPA Midwest Enforcement Director James McDonald calls the consent decree a " monumental first " that will help the agency in bargaining with other companies and communities ( including the city of Detroit ) that resist its decrees . Says McDonald : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm One and seek indication of the substantial penal agency 's hard line : before the consent decree , it had begun proceedings to make U.S. <P> Steel ineligible to win federal contracts . <P> By contrast , the stiff cost of the consent decree was a small price to pay .
