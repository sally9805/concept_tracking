During the first few months of each year , Detroit 's auto manufacturers stage a strange and well-guarded ritual at their test sites . Using cars equipped with the following model-year 's engine , test drivers go through an endless automotive pentathlon of starts and stops , cruising and idling , turning and backing up . Even so , company engineers must wait four months to get the results they want : a series of cars that have clocked 50,000 miles each of simulated commuter driving on Los Angeles freeways with almost no repair work . Only after the exhaust emissions from vehicles thus tested have been measured can the automakers know whether the engines scheduled for introduction the following September will meet federal antipollution standards . <P> Last week Ford Motor Co. announced that the whole tortuous testing program on its 1973-model engines had been invalidated by an incredible staff bungle . During the course of the 50,000-mile trial runs , the company said , Ford employees performed " unscheduled , unauthorized maintenance " on the test cars , presumably including engine tune-ups and replacement of points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure emissions from cars that have been kept in less than topnotch condition-as will often happen when they get into buyers ' hands-the unscheduled repair work threw a monkey wrench into Ford 's results . Earlier the company had quietly withdrawn its application for engine approval from the Environmental Protection Agency , and last week it announced that four testing employees were being " reassigned . " Growled an angry Henry Ford II : " It is fair to say we are in one hell of a lot of trouble . " <P> Precisely how much trouble remained to be seen . Legally , the EPA could force Ford to begin a new round of tests , delaying production of its ' 73 models for as much as two months . But since some 170,000 Ford employees would be thrown out of work during the wait , EPA Deputy Administrator Robert Fri said that it would be " cruel " to go that far . Instead , the agency might let Ford produce and ship new cars on schedule but force it to withhold them from the market until final certification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financially because it would be unable to sell cars during the early weeks of new-model introductions . Sales during those weeks go far to establish each automaker 's share of the market for the model year . Another possibility is that computer data on the faulty engine tests may be reprogrammed to compensate for some of the maintenance violations , allowing Ford to start selling some of its 1973 models on schedule in late September .
