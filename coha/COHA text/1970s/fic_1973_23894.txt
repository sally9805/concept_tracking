THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE by Donald Barthelme Music from somewhere . It is Vivaldi 's great work , The Semesters . The students wandered among the exhibits . The Fisher King was there . We walked among the industrial achievements . A good-looking gas turbine , behind a velvet rope . The manufacturers described themselves in their literature as " patient and optimistic . " The students gazed , and gaped . Hitting them with ax handles is no longer permitted , hugging and kissing them is no longer permitted , speaking to them is permitted but only under extraordinary circumstances . The Fisher King was there . In Current Pathology by Spurry and Entemann the King is called " a doubtful clinical entity . " But Spurry and Entemann have never caught him , so far as is known . Transfer of information from the world to the eye is permitted if you have signed oaths of loyalty to the world , to the eye , to Current Pathology . 1 4 We moved on . The two major theories of origins , evolution and creation , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloons , bumper stickers , pieces of the True Cross . On the walls , photographs of stocking masks . The visible universe was doing very well , we decided , a great deal of movement , flux  --  unimpaired vitality . We made the students add odd figures , things like 453198*23:J and 8977 ? 22MARY . This was part of the educational experience , we told them , and not even the hard part ? just one side of a many-sided effort . But what a wonderful time you 'll have , we told them , when the experience is over , done , completed . You will all , we told them , be more beautiful than you are now , and more employable too . You will have a grasp of the total situation ; the total situation will have a grasp of you . The best way to live is by not knowing what will happen to you at the end of the day , when the sun goes down and the supper is to be cooked . The students looked at each other with secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , we who are doing the best we can . The invitation to indulge in emotion at the expense of rational analysis already constitutes a political act , as per our phoncon of 11/9/72 . We came to a booth where the lessons of 1914 were latight . There were some wild strawberries there , in the pool of blood , and someone was playing the piano , softly , in the pool of blood , and the Fisher King was fishing , hopelessly , in the pool of blood . The pool is a popular meeting place for younger people but we are n't younger anymore so we hurried on . " Come and live with me , " that was something somebody said to someone else , a bizarre idea that was quickly scotched  --  we do n't want that kind of idea to become general , or popular . reeinfleri , n.rrern . NAV ' " The world is everything that was formerly the case , " the group leader said , " and now it is time to gel back on the bus . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We paid them with soluble traveler 's checks and hoped for rain , and hoped for rodomontade , braggadocio , blare , bray , fanfare , flourish . tucket.
