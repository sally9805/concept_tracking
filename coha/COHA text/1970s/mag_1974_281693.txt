The actors and props were assembled for an occasion of high drama . For the first time in the nation 's history , a President was appearing on Capitol Hill to submit himself formally to the questions of a congressional committee . <P> What was more , President Ford was there to discuss an intensely controversial and emotional subject-his pardoning of Richard Nixon for any offenses he had committed while in the White House . But despite the setting and expectations , last week 's event was something of a disappointment-nearly as inconclusive as the soap operas it displaced in two hours of network time . <P> The session left troubling questions unanswered , doubts unresolved , and Ford still struggling to find a way of exorcising the wraith of Nixon that haunts his presidency . <P> Good Reasons . The questions about the pardon were posed by a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee , the body that had so diligently weighed the evidence against Nixon before recommending his impeachment . <P> The subcommittee had originally submitted its queries to the White House ; what it got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of news conferences . When committee members bristled at that response , Ford resolved to appear before the group himself , stubbornly prevailing over the fears of some of his lieutenants . <P> The President , in fact , had good political reasons for going up to the Hill . His decision to grant the pardon had shaken public confidence in his candor and judgment and damaged the chances of G.O.P. candidates in the November elections . Indeed , the initial reaction from Democrats in Congress to Ford 's self-invitation was anger at Subcommittee Chairman William L. Hungate for inadvertently giving Ford the chance to get off the hook . <P> Appearing in the imposing room where the impeachment hearings were held , Ford was completely at ease . For the most part , he was treated with reverence by subcommittee members , who looked down from the top row of the long tiers of desks . Speaking earnestly and confidently , Ford hammered home his answers to the two basic questions . Was there a deal between Nixon and himself ? " I assure you that there never was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon if he were to resign and I were to become President , " said Ford in his opening statement . Later he added : " There was no deal , period , under no circumstances . " <P> Why , then , had Ford pardoned Nixon ? He was afraid that possible criminal proceedings against the former President , which could have dragged out for years , would have riven the country . Said Ford : " I wanted to do all I could to change our attentions from the pursuit of a fallen President to the pursuit of the urgent needs of a rising nation . " <P> Ford did admit that the question of pardoning Nixon had come up while he was still Vice President . On Aug. 1 Alexander Haig , then White House chief of staff , mentioned it to Ford as one of a number of options being considered in the White House . But Ford insisted to the subcommittee that he had not replied yea or nay to Haig 's comments . <P> <P> Nor had he committed himself to consider them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was making no recommendation whatsoever about anything having to do with a possible Nixon resignation or a pardon .
