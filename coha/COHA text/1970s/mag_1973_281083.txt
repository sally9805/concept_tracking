In Athens , a city where " everybody knows everybody else , " almost everybody has heard of Brigadier General Dimitrios loannidis ( pronounced Ee-o-ahn-ee-dis ) . A spectral , Beria-like figure who commands Greece 's military police force-the feared ESA-loannidis was not seen by the public even at the swearing-in ceremony of Phaedon Gizikis , the colorless army general who is Greece 's new President . He did not really have to , since it is loannidis and not Gizikis who runs the junta . <P> Despite his notoriety , loannidis is a man few Greeks have actually seen . " Well , he is about 5 ft. 9 in. or 10 in . He is thin , looks about 52 , and has graying hair , " goes one grudging description . An austere , hard-lining rightist , who lives alone , loannidis is described by one Washington military official as " a real tough cookie . " Other acquaintances emphasize his reputation for being wholly incorruptible . <P> Little is known about loannidis ' past . Born in 1923 , the son of a moderately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1940 , shortly before his country was attacked by Italy . During World War II , loannidis served with an anti-German ( and antiCommunist ) resistance unit . After the war , he was assigned to a succession of low-profile and lusterless army jobs . <P> loannidis was rescued from obscurity by George Papadopoulos as a reward for having helped him come to power in 1967 . Papadopoulos made him chief of the military police , which gradually had been transformed into an internal security army . When Papadopoulos declared martial law after the 1967 coup , he increased ESA 'S power even further by making it the junta 's chief arm of law and order . Many of the allegations of prisoner torture under the Papadopoulos regime involve ESA . <P> loannidis used his power base as the nation 's police chief to oust his old boss , who he felt was liberalizing life in Greece much too quickly . Just what plans loannidis now has for Greece remain unclear . Some observers consider him a rigid , puritanical xenophobe-he has never been outside Greece or Cyprus - who might try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Libya . One thing is certain : he does not plan to return Greece to democracy any time soon .
