txt The picture is etched in many people 's minds . There 's the young law clerk , tired after a hard day assisting the local lawyer but nevertheless burning the midnight oil to study legal tomes and learn enough to become a fullfledged lawyer . The time is the 1830s , and the young clerk is Abraham Lincoln . But look closer . That 's not Abe Lincoln . It 's Mona Nedlik . And it 's not the 1830s . It 's the 1960s . Mrs. Nedlik , who clerked for four years and then passed the New York state bar examination in 1968 , is one of a handful of people who have become lawyers in recent years without going to law school . That used to be the accepted way of learning the profession , but now it is possible in only a few states . Most lawyers are unaware that anybody " reads law " these days , and many of those attorneys who do know of the practice frown on it . " Clerking is as much an anachronism as the horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police court judge who heads a Pennsylvania Bar Ascnriation committee that has recommended that clerking be abolished in that state . Edward Smith , executive secretary of the Rhode Island Bar Association , says he is against the practice , adding : " You would n't let a doctor study in a doctor 's office now for four years and then practice medicine . " " The Abe Lincoln Argument " Rhode Island is the most recent state to abolish clerking , reducing the number that allow it to ** Delaware , New York , Montana , Mississippi , Pennsylvania , Texas , Virginia , Washington and Vermont . That total is down from 35 in 1951 . The number of people who actually clerk " is so infinitesimal that we do n't even keep records , " says an official of the American Bar Association , but he estimates the number of clerks admitted to the bar at between five and 20 a year . It 's unlikely that the practice will ever disappear , however . Advocates of clerking , says the ABA official , cite the persuasive " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President had it not been for this provision . " The few people who do clerk for the required two to five years and gain admission to the bar are unanimous in their praise of the system . Most say they could never have gone to law school , for financial or other reasons , and thus would never have become lawyers . Carleton Monaghan , a former locomotive engineer , is certain he would still be on the railroad if it had n't been for clerking : Mr. Monaghan , now 58 years old , had wanted to attend law school during the 1930s , but he could n't afford it in those Depression years . The dream of being a lawyer persisted , though , and finally in the early ' 60s he began clerking for a Vermont lawyer without pay while he continued to work on the railroad . He clerked for four years and was admitted to the bar in 1967. lie now heads a local office of Vermont Legal Aid , an organization that provides legal help to the poor , and he says he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestigious Wall Street firm of Cravath , Swaine &; Moore , is also quite happy . Mrs. Beshar was admitted to the bar in 1960 , after having clerked in New York for four years , and she is believed to be the only clerk to crack Wall Street in recent years . " I think it 's terrific that the system is there in which to do it , " she says . Mrs. Beshar believes she got a solid legal education by clerking , and she asserts that clerks " are miles ahead ( of law school graduates ) on matters of procedure . " But other lawyers say that the clerks generally do n't receive the theoretical background that many lawyers consider necessary for a broad legal education . Mr. Smith of the Rhode Island Bar Aqsoriation says it is " impractical for one man to say he has given ( a clerk ) the equivalent of a law school education . " " An Excellent Student " ? , Clerks who have become lawyers say their major problem was to find a-lawyer with the time and inclination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working for a relative or good friend . Mrs. Ruth Finn of Barre , Vt. , a 34-year-old mother of two , is reading law in her father 's law office , for instance . Mrs. Nedlik , the woman clerk admitted to practice , in New York in 1988 , was a legal secretary in Binghamton , N.Y. , before she took up clerking , and she persuaded her boss to oversee her work . Some of the people who clerk , perhaps a majority , never pass - the bar exam , a rigorous test that many law school graduates also repeatedly fail . But those- clerks who do pass the exam often turn out to be good lawyers . Mrs. Nedlik , for instance , was " an excellent student " and appears to be handling herself well as a lawyer , says a spokesman for Levene , Gouldin &; Thompson in Binghamton . Mrs. Beshar of Cravath , Swaine &; Moore also is highly regarded . A lawyer at Mudge , Rose , Guthrie &; Alexander , the law firm where President Nixon used to work , acknowledges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff , but he adds , " If someone like Christine Beshar showed up , we 'd hire her .
