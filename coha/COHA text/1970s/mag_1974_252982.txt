" Give God a solo ! " the audiences shouted . In reply , a thin young man with an electric guitar would shuffle to the microphone , close his eyes and raise up a musical inferno . One of the first of the ' 60s superstars , Eric Clapton was a charter member of rock 's inner circle-along with Bob Dylan , the Beatles and the Rolling Stones . As a member of the British trio Cream , he transformed simple blues lines into brilliant horizontal diffusions of sound . By 1970 Clapton was considered to be the world 's top rock guitarist , had sold some $12 million worth of records . Then he stopped performing . <P> Physically and spiritually depleted , he retired at 26-a heroin addict . <P> This spring there was a quiet announcement that he planned to cut a record in Miami , then make a five-week U.S. tour . He is clear-eyed and healthy , but retains some blunt and black views about drugs and musicians . " The same thing that makes a man pick up his guitar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug he can find , " he says . <P> " Music is really escapism . It 's shutting yourself off from everything else , going into a cupboard and staying there . <P> That 's what drugs do and that 's what music does . They go hand in hand . " <P> Identity Shield . Last winter , aware that dope was canceling out his life , Clapton submitted to an experimental form of acupuncture . A month later he was free of his addiction . Recalling the treatment he says , " The doctor , a middle-aged Scotswoman , and her husband , a preacher-they really cared . They , as much as anything , brought me through . " <P> Without dope , Clapton drinks more . He feels , perhaps optimistically , that he sweats out the poison in performance . <P> He has also adopted a series of " disguises " as a kind of identity shield . One night he may appear onstage in a three-piece suit , the next in jeans . <P> He opened his comeback tour in a steady drizzle at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , appropriately Let It Rain , revealed a richer , stronger voice . From watching Stevie Wonder sing , Clapton says , he learned to breathe in great drafts from his diaphragm . " It sends the blood rushing to my head and gives me an incredible high , " he laughs . " I sometimes get dizzy onstage . " <P> Clapton 's mature style-in songs like Give Me Strength and Let It Grow from his new album , 461 Ocean Boulevard-is free of the ostentatious virtuosity that sometimes disfigured his playing in the past . But the quicksilver runs and keyboard rampages that earned him the ironic nickname " Slow-hand " are still there . Sometimes Clapton turned his back to the audience to listen in turn to each musician in his excellent group-Carl Radle on bass , Dick Sims at the keyboards , Drummer Jamie Oldaker , Guitarist George Terry and Singer Yvonne Elliman.
