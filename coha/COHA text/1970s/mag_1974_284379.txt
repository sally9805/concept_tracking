Statistically , a passenger on a scheduled airline flight in the U.S. has a 99.99992% chance of landing safe and sound . Indeed , Lloyd 's of London calculates that a person is 24 times more likely to be killed in a car than in an airliner . Nevertheless , 461 people have died in eight U.S. air crashes so far this year , the worst record of fatalities since 1960 . All too often the cause has been a simple mechanical fault or , more disturbing yet , an elementary error committed by a flight crew . As a result , questions are being raised with increasing frequency and urgency about the performance of the Government 's bureau charged with the primary responsibility of protecting the flying public : the Federal Aviation Administration . <P> The man on the spot at the FAA is Administrator Alexander P. Butterfield , 48 , a former Air Force colonel and F-111 pilot who joined President Richard Nixon 's staff as an aide in 1969 . In July 1973 , Butterfield gave Watergate an entirely new dimension by disclosing the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's committee and the world . By that time , Butterfield had been head of the FAA for four months , a job he got as a reward for his efficient service in the White House ( he was never brushed by Watergate ) , and was already struggling with the organizational problems that are partially to blame for the agency 's lagging response to the need to exercise closer control over flight safety . <P> When it was set up in 1958 , the FAA was an independent office with the power to act on its own . But in 1967 the agency was incorporated into the newly created Department of Transportation , which is geared more toward the problems of trains and automobiles than of airplanes . Butterfield has had trouble getting approval of a reorganization plan for his sizable operation-55,000 people and a budget of $1.5 billion-and he has even had problems filling key jobs . " I 'm still frustrated over the inability to put the people I want where I want them , " Butterfield told TIME Correspondent Jerry Hannifin . " We 're very institutionalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliques are fantastic . So much could be done , but you need a free hand . I thought as an agency head you 'd have clout . But you do n't , and that was surprising to me . " <P> The most serious charge against Butterfield is that the FAA has been slow to respond to the recommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board , an independent agency that has the responsibility in the federal hierarchy of promoting safety in all modes of transportation . The NTSB has also taken over the job of investigating aircraft accidents from the Civil Aeronautics Board . <P> Taped Voice . By law , the NTSB can not order the FAA to take action , but it can prod hard . On Oct. 8 , NTSB Chairman John H. Reed sent Butterfield an official letter about the " unprofessional conduct " demonstrated by a few U.S. flight crews . To document his concern , Reed cited a number of horrifying incidents resulting from sloppy flying in recent years-a DC-9 striking the water and then bouncing safely into the air while nearing Martha 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea wall while approaching airports ; a DC-9 hitting the runway so hard in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , that it broke in two .
