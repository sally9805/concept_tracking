When the U.S. Interior Department put the American alligator on its list of endangered species in 1967 , conservationists were delighted . But poachers kept on killing the " gators , " which grow up to 12 ft. in length , and selling the skins for as much as $9 per ft . To end the incentive for slaughtering the beasts , the Federal Government finally cracked down last year on businesses dealing in the hides . That move has worked too well . With no enemies left , the alligators are proliferating wildly , especially in Louisiana . Indeed , says Luke Petrovich , a county public-safety commissioner , " we 're up to our seats in alligators . " <P> By far the most serious problem area is the southern part of the state , where new housing developments have been built along the marshy bayous where the alligators live . Last summer , for example , a family in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie went out to its swimming pool for an evening dip , but stopped short : a 4-ft. alligator was lolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoked or hosed out of culverts in Golden Meadow , Morgan City and other towns south of New Orleans . <P> Even New Orleans is infested . An eleven-man team of experts recently spent a month trying to rid the City Park 's lagoons of gators that had already eaten all the park 's ducks and were working their way through its fish and turtles . Panicked phone callers-as many as seven a week-report alligators in residential districts , even in the affluent sections bordering Bayou St. <P> John . Several dogs that wandered too close to the water 's edge perished when what looked like a log suddenly thrashed into hungry action . The threat has become so great that golfers playing on the bayou-laced local links are advised not to look for balls lost in the water . <P> There is only one documented case of an alligator actually killing a person ( last year in Florida ) . But the creatures have needle-sharp teeth , and the big ones can crunch a leg or arm off a grown man . Though the gator still tends to avoid people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wild Life and Fisheries Commission , " he domesticates quite easily and loses his fear of people . <P> You feed him once . Then there 's always the chance he will turn on you . " <P> Right now , Louisiana " relocates " captured alligators to wildlife management areas far from human settlements . <P> But even there the great reptiles reportedly are gobbling up such valuable fur-bearing animals as muskrat and nutria - not to mention possum , raccoon , frogs , fish and whatever else they can lay their jaws on . A better solution , state officials say , would be to reopen a limited hunting season on the gators . " We never agreed with the Federal Government that the alligator was an endangered species , " says Joanen . " We have 1 million to 1.5 million of them here now . And the number is growing .
