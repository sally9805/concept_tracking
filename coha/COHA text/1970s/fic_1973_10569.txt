" Very interesting . " I was suddenly back in my old milieu again , the old professional . I took a slow drink from my glass . " Is that the story you tell around here ? " " Sure . Why ? " " And they believe you ? Jesus , " I said . I took another drink . " You know what you smell like to me , Gruner ? You smell like cop . " Pete smiled coolly , his eyebrows amused . " How do cops smell ? " " Old , " I said , with a false croak . " And sore-footed . And frustrated . From either kicking people too much to no avail , or from walking around and around in bad shoes trying to help them and failing . You smell like T-man , or CIA , or a Narcotics man . " Pete was still smiling . " Not me . " " You 're not a cop ? " " No , I 'm not . You would n't expect me to tell you if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to answer that by saying Fair enough . I did n't feel like it . I just looked at him . The three young Americans were playing bad music again . " What do you want from me ? " " Nothing . I was just wondering if you were down here on something special ? Or just looking around in general ? Or what ? And for who ? " " I 'm on vacation . " " Sure . I heard that . Like every private op from America in Athens comes to Tsatsos on vacation . You are a private op ? " " You want to see my license ? " " Me ? No . I do n't have any authority , man . Like I told you , I 'm a dropout . I just work a while , until I save some money . Then I come here and stay until it 's spent . But I live here , man . I 'm interested .

" He just smiled , and chose to deliberately misread me . " Heroin I do n't know anything about , and it does n't interest me . I 've never tried it . I like to smoke a little hash , though , now and then . But just moderately . Heroin is bad medicine . " He had plenty of cool on him under that little beard . I wondered what he would say if I told him what my old last-century nose had begun to sniff at suspiciously around the bootheels of Mr. Leonid Kronitis . " Heroin is bad medicine , " I said . " But heroin has never been one of my problems . Nor one of my assignments . Does that help you any ? " " Not much . " He was certainly a smiler , this Pete .

It depends . " " Well , I 'll tell you , " I said confidentially . " I picked it out . By myself . You want to know how ? " " How ? " " With an eyedropper on a map . Now . How 's that ? I just took the old eyedropper and held it over the map and shut my eyes , and ping . Tsatsos . That answer your question ? " " Sure . That answers my question . Well , " he got up , still smiling . He put money on the table . " Here 's for my drink . Everybody pays his own tab here . " He moved his head backward , to include the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see me around for exactly two weeks , or three . Till my vacation 's over . If I can hack it that long . "  |p116He  just nodded . Still smiling . He was certainly goodlookingenough , in his hippie outfit . Slowly , still with full self-appreciation of himself , he wandered off toward the path . I motioned for the waiter and paid . I wandered out toward the path myself . I hoped I did it with one half the dash Pete did it with . I knew I did n't . Marie waved at me from her table . On the road the others had disappeared . There was nobody , no Pete , no mother and daughter , no horsecabs , no nothing . I started to walk back toward Dmitri 's . So . Now we had a new wrinkle . Pete Gruner . The dropoutcop . By process of elimination he almost had to be a nark . There did n't appear to be anything political around , to call for a CIA . Would the Treasury send a man to check on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So he almost had to be a nark , and that meant heroin . Was there a big heroin operation going on here ? Girgis and Kirk would n't fool around with vest-pocket hash runningif they were involved in something like big-time heroin smuggling . Would Kronitis be ? A man that rich ? In something that dangerous ? Did n't seem logical . Or maybe Pete Gruner was just traveling , and sniffing in general , without any specific target ? There was probably a lot of stuff going on in all these islands so close to Turkey . Or maybe Pete Gruner was just gumshoeing addicts , to make a traceback . How many H addicts might there be up there on the hill at the Construction , I wondered suddenly . There ought to be a few . That boyfriend of Marie 's , Slow John . A blown acid head . And rich . He was almost a natural for an H addiction . And if there were some , where were they getting their stuff ? Maybe Gruner was working on that ? Hell , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamping ground in the East Village.  |p117And  why would he come up and expose himself like that to me . Maybe he did n't think he was exposing himself , at first ? But he certainly did n't get very nervous when I tumbled to him . But then who would I tell about him ? Marie , and Georgina , and Chantal ? Ambassador Pierson ? Who else did I know ? And who was going to believe me ? Maybe he wanted me to tell somebody ? Some big shot he thought I might be down here working for . In order to flush somebody ? It did n't any of it make much sense . Ahead of me the lights of Dmitri 's taverna became specific lights , instead of just a general glow . There was n't so much noise from it now , it was almost midnight . I walked in under the fall of light from the overhead lamps , thinking that I was going to be due at Chantal 's soon , and then saw that the big man who was captain of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite edge of the lightfall . It was a curious configuration , Dmitri 's taverna . Largely because the one-track seawall road ran right through the middle of it , so to speak . The road ran right against the front of the building , so that the waiters had to cross this hard-dirt-and-gravel road to get to the dining tables which were on the other side and built out over the water . The horsecabs and the few official jeeps and trucks were liable to drive right through the middle of your dinner leaving a film of dust on your food . Thus , Kirk and I found ourselves standing in the opposite edges of the light at the opposite ends of this unoccupied one-laner road , that ran through the place like a tunnel . We looked like the perfectly staged final shootout scene from some Greek Western . And me not wearing any iron . Kirk was n't doing anything . He was just standing there and looking at me . He might have been waiting for me to appear exactly where and when I did appear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't crowded , but it was n't empty . There were three or four occupied tables out by the water , and in the open , roofed-over patio room beside the taverna building under the bright lights there were three or four others . Suddenly Kirk began to caper . He started to prance up and down on his tiptoes , and fling his arms around over his head , his back all hunched down like some dwarf , an enormous leer of a grin on his face . Kirk was a big man but he was n't a very tall man . He was only maybe five foot ten . But he was an enormously broad man , both in the shoulders and in the hips , and meat bulged from him everywhere . His head at his ears appeared to be narrower than his neck . He certainly looked peculiar . Like that . With legs like treetrunks and huge bulging arms , he capered up and down in front of me at the other edge of the light . And more peculiar still , nobody at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attention to him . I did n't know what to do . I could n't figure out if he was trying to put me on and make fun of me ? Vanity made my ears burn . I could n't very well turn around and walk away . For a moment my aging persecution complex , thickened and lumpy from years of being kicked by clients ' enemies and clients themselves , made me wonder if all of them were n't banded together in a complot to make me a laughingstock . I started to walk ahead . Kirk was still capering , and flinging his arms around . of basso falsetto , if such a thing was possible . " Hi , there ! I 'm back from Athens ! I had a talk with her ! I had a talk with him ! Naturally I brought her back with me ! Do you think it 's fair for a man to threaten a girl with suicide ! I do n't think it 's much class ! "  |p119Not  a soul at any of the tables seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . He was mimickingSonny Duval 's conversation with me of an hour before . But how had he heard it ? There had n't been anybody near us . Had Sonny told him what he 'd said ? Had Kirk been standing out in the dark beyond the end of the taverna listening ? And why did n't the people at the tables pay even the slightest attention to us ? Were they used to him as some kind of nut ? Was he some kind of nut ? I went on walking toward him . He went on capering . He was directly between me and the path to my house , but I could easily walk right around him . Then I decided I did n't want to . Some facts I wanted might come out of this . Chantal could wait a little . I sat down at an empty table not far from him and motioned for the waiter . Kirk immediately stopped prancingand came striding over to me , and stuck out his hand and sat down . " Jim Kirk , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , but it seemed to disappear completely . His voice had the rumble of a firedupvolcano . It seemed to come from somewhere down near the backs of his knees . " Lobo Davies , " I said . But it was a perfectly normal , sane , everyday tone he had ; and he was n't at all grinning . And all around us not one person had turned his or her head to even glance at us . " What do you want to drink ? " I said . " I 'll have a double Scotch . On the rocks , " Kirk said evenly . " Or , if you think you can afford it , a triple . On the rocks . " " That was some exhibition you just put on . " " I wanted to be sure of catching your attention , " he said without expression . I told the waiter a triple Scotch on the rocks . " Well , you did , " I said . " Do you do that often ? "  | " That depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us ? " " Yes . " " They know me around here . So they know what to ex-pect . " " Well , it 's certainly a novel way of attracting someone 's attention , " I said . " I invented it . It 's all my own . Of course I do n't always do it the same . " " That 's good to know . " The waiter brought our drinks . Kirk drained his in one huge draught , tossed the ice cubes out over the rail into the water , and upended the glass upsidedownon the tablecloth . " How did you know I was going to appear here exactly when I did ? " He smiled . " I ca n't give away all my little secrets . " " No , " I said , " I suppose not . " " That 's some piece of tail , ai n't she ? " Kirk said . That almost stopped me , for a moment . " I would n't know , " I said . " She looks fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but that grubby Mother Hubbard . " " Wait , " Kirk said . " Just wait . " That enormous great leer of before began to come over his face . It seemed to start at the bottom of his chin and spread slowly all the way up , broadening his whole face . " She 'll be popping out in one of her bikinis soon now , and you 'll see . I had a couple of pieces of her myself . Before she started running around with Con . I think I 'll go back to it for some more . " " She seems to be pretty stuck on Con , " I said . " Only for as long as it takes her to change her diaphragm . Then she 'll be out patrolling again . I could use a month or so of her . " The leer began to fade out from his face , slowly , starting from the top down . " What do you think it is makes a fellow like that let his woman run around she-catting like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " Sonny believes in free love , " I said . " And he 's a pacifist. "  | " Well , it ai n't free for him , " Kirk said solemnly . " I admit , it 's almost free . He bought that big dump of a boat for a little of nothing . And he 's got two poverty-stricken Greeks to do all the dirty work on his boats for him and pays them next to nothing . He feeds her swill and rotgut retsina . But she likes to go away a lot . To restore her spirituals . And I do n't blame her . If I had to live like that , I 'd want to restore my spirituals . It costs him a lot in Athens and Rome . They go to Rome winters " " What did you want to see me about , Kirk ? " I said . " Besidesto talk about Jane Duval . " " Well , I thought maybe you might want to charter my ship , " he rumbled . " To go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Any damn where in the world . But I 'd rather keep her in the Mediterranean . Cruise the Greek islands ? Sail down the Turkish coast ? Go to Sicily ? " " What made you think I might want to charter your ship ? " " Well , you were asking questions about me around , and all , " Kirk said solemnly . " Like with old Dmitrios . " " I just asked about the boat because I thought she was so unusual looking . And so beautiful . " " She is beautiful . And I thought sure it was something like that with you . Or that you wanted to see about a charter . " If he thought he was kidding me or convincing me of something , and I was n't sure he did , I saw no reason to not let him . " Well , I have to think about it . " " You do that , " Kirk said , and then winked at me with an eyelid that resembled a furry-edged slab of thin sliced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you come ask Jim Kirk direct . I 'll be glad to tell you the history of the ship . Or make a run up to Athens with you for some broads . Anything . I know some great ones . "  | " That might be a good idea , " I said . " Maybe you 're worrying about all that extra carrying work I do for Girgis ? In case you wanted to charter me ? Do n't you give it another thought . " I did n't answer that . " Girgis 'll just have to get another guy . He 's had to do it before . He 's getting mighty cocky , Girgis . " He leaned forward making the tin table creak , and pointed a finger like one of Darryl Zanuck 's cigars an inch from my chest . " Maybe you want some hashish . Well , you get it from me in a big lot , instead of buying it from Girgis in little bits . It 'll cost you a fifth as much . " He sat back expansively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's heroin ? " Kirk said innocently . " Never touch heroin . Too many American Boy Scout agents running around Europe nowdays . And you do n't look like no heroin man . " Maybe I 've got some friends . " " Sure you have . And I know them all . And I do n't think they 'd be asking you to help them get their stash . If I may say so . " " You can say so , " I said . " Well , " Kirk said , and that enormous leer began to climb up over his face again . He slammed a big piece of meat down on the tin table top . " Got to go . Better be moving along . " When he stood , he actually made the tin table groan . " Now you know where you can always find me . " He picked out the moored Agoraphobe with his eyes for me . It was all lit up and abuzz with crew , as if getting ready to pull out . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you want . " " Better wait on that last , " I said . " I guess so , " Kirk grinned . " Since I 'm pulling out again in a few minutes . " And he went walking away into the dark , rolling on his short massive legs , and I sat looking after him.  |p123I  had the impression he would just bull ahead and do anything , anything that came in his head and that he wanted to do . He would talk or fight his way out of it afterward . If it was necessary . And had complete confidence that he could . Keep away , was what he was telling me . In his own convolutedand inimitable fashion . Keep your nose out and keep it clean , copper . Nobody around here seemed to understand that private eyes were not cops and that usually cops were more our enemies than anybody 's . Well , he had some kind of weird rudimentary sense of humor anyway . Or he seemed to . I paid . Again . It always seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got a horsecab beside the taverna , to take up to Chantal's.  |p124I  told the driver I wanted to go to Georgio 's taverna . I figured Chantal deserved that much protection . Since she was being so careful of her reputation . The night sky was bright above the open cab . The land breeze had brought cooler air down from the pines on the hills . The moon either had set , or had n't come up yet . It was quiet with the clop of the horse . Halfway out the one main road that ran along the hill face , I told the driver to stop and paid him off . I waited until he disappeared . Then I started walking straight uphill , on the street to Chantal 's . There were very few street lights up here . The narrow cobbled street was walled on both sides . You could smell the flowering trees and bushes . I was thinking , with my professional'smind , what a great place it would be to waylay somebody when three men stepped out of the shadows into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and started to walk down to me . I felt my native combativeness spring out all over me . A happy red gorge rose at the back of my swallowing mechanism . It always made my ears ring a little , and it always made my jaw come out and gave me a kind of rictal grin . I could n't help it , I liked it . Of course , I could always turn around and run back down the hill and let them chase me . I could also get down on my knees and beg them not to hit me . Of course , maybe they were n't after me at all . But I did n't believe it . Maybe it was the way they were n't talking , that tipped it.  |p125I  licked my lips and grinned up at them as I climbed up to them . When I was five yards from them the two on the outsidesdarted in toward me , and the one in the middle ran right at me . I knew what to do with that . I ran head-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already put the other two a few feet behind me . The surprised man in front of me tried to slow up . I did n't give him a chance . I caught him by his shirt front with both hands and yanked him to me and hit him full in the face with the top of my forehead . I got one glimpse of his startled face , before my head hit him . He went down without a peep . I 'd heard the bone in his nose break and knew he would n't want any more fighting tonight . The other two had had to change their line of run , costingthem a few seconds . I tried to jump over the downed man and move forward to get room to turn around but I was n't quite agile enough . Age , again . One of them pinned my arms from behind and the other jumped in front of me and began to slug me in the face and belly . I could feel the downed man struggling feebly under us to try and get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and on . But it does n't really . Six , eight , ten , twelve punches . Most people do n't realize the number of hard punches you can take . Especially if you are moving all the time and can roll with some of them . Both of these guys were young . The one in front , a blond , looked like a semi-moron . I managed to break loose , by bull strength mostly , and swung around and left-hooked the one behind me to his knees , then swung around to the other . The blond was rushing me . Instead of ducking I stepped to meet him , grabbed him by the lapels and jerked him in and hit him in the face with my forehead , too . I did n't get as good a shot at him , and hit him somewhere below the nose in the teeth . But it was enough to put him down and I knew he would have a few loose teeth for ap126week . The other man was back on his feet and I turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The blond , half-blinded , was on one knee when I turned back to him . A switchblade knife glittered open in his hand . I started toward him but the second man called something in Greek and the blond backed away . Crablike , he circled around me to get downhill to his friend . We stood and looked at each other . The downed man was still feebly trying to crawl away out from under the fight . I backed off a couple of steps , to let them come get their friend , and together they backed off down the street half-dragging the friend , with me standing there watching them . There had n't been one word said , except that one call in Greek . At the main road , which was the first corner , they rounded the corner out of sight . But they did n't turn back down toward the Port , they turned toward Georgio 's . I did not know what that might signify . Chantal 's was only a couple of doors away up the hill beyond the light . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute trying to figure it out . Figure it out who these guys were , and what they wanted with trying to beat me up . Obviously they were hired . Obviously the beatingwas to be a warning . But while these guys might be fairly accomplished street fighters , they certainly were n't professional hoodlums . Leaning against the wall , I was still breathing raggedly , and bleeding a little . I had cut my forehead on a tooth when I head-punched the second guy . And I had a cut lip and a couple of nice facial abrasions that were beginning to swell . My ribs hurt , too . I had n't felt so satisfied and so peaceful in a long time . I had n't felt this satisfied since before the little Greek attorney in Paris . In fact , I had to keep my teeth clamped together to keep from laughing out loud in the street . By God , I was n't so bad off after all , old age or not . I could still hit a moving target.  |p127Some  people , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to hear me say something like that . Well , I could n't help it . I tried the garden door and it was open and I went on in and up the steps . Chantal was there , all right . She was waiting for me all alone on her garden terrace . Apparently the rest of the house was asleep . She was wearing one of those summer dresses and no jewelry . The night was still beautiful . She apparently had n't heard any sounds of the fight . She motionedwith her finger to her lips for me to be quiet . Then she saw my face . " My God , what happened to you ? " I had my handkerchief out . " A couple of punks tried to give me a working over . Three of them . They were n't very professional about it . Do you mind if I sit down ? " I was suddenly feeling very gay , and had to hold myself down . I gave her a cautious grin . " I do n't come back quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " She looked horrified . " You look awful . " " You should see the other guys . Actually , I do n't feel bad . I just feel like somebody ran me through the wringer of their washing machine . " I wiped the trickle from the cut on my forehead and patted my bloody lip . " Who knew I was coming here ? " " Why , no one . " " You did n't tell anybody ? " " Would I be likely to tell anyone you were coming to my house late at night ? " " I do n't know . You might . " That hurt her feelings . " Well , I did n't . " " Then somebody sure made an inspired guess . " I guess I was just barely aware I had hurt her . I did n't care if I had . I was not about to go into another long involved explanationabout how I could n't really trust her because she did n't tell me the truth about herself . " A very inspired guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , she swallowed the hurt pride . " How do you mean ? " " Well , who would figure I was coming here ? At all ? After midnight ? Second place , who would figure out I would leave the horsecab on the main road , like I did , and walk up ? To protect your good name ' ? That 's pretty smart figuring . " " But who would want to do something like that to you ? " " I do n't know . Your friend Girgis might . This hippie guy Steve might . But those three were n't hippies . " I straightened up on the bench and grinned at her . " It might even have been Kirk . " " Kirk ? " she said weakly . " The captain of the Agoraphobe . You do n't know him ? " " I know who he is . How do you know Kirk ? " " He introduced himself to me tonight , " I said , and gave her another grin . " Apparently I 've made a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would the mention of Kirk affect her so ? I said , " My guess is that it was Girgis . But how he would guess I was  --  " I did n't finish , because she looked distressed . I looked at her . She did n't seem to want to meet my eyes . And I suddenlyknew for no other reason than that , that she had told Girgis , or somebody , about me . She might not have told them I was coming up here on any specific night at any specific hour , like tonight , but she had told them enough so that they could plan out the rest . " Do you think we could have a drink ? " I said softly . It seemed to me I had just divined an old affair between her and Girgis . I had speculated about that once before . But I certainly was n't going to mention it . " A Scotch ? " ii " I 've got them all ready for us , " she said stiffly , and got up to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came back with them , she had straightened out her face . She said , " You really like it , do n't you ? This fighting . You do n't even mind being beaten up , do you ? You enjoy it . "  | " I must . Otherwise I 'd change my way of making a living , would n't I ? " " It 's very boyish . It 's like a group of boys at boys ' school . All male vanity and ego . Pummeling and punching each other . " " This kind of fighting was n't boyish , " I said . " I 've never met anyone quite like you . " " Yes . You keep saying that . Could I have a Band-Aid for my head ? " " There are some upstairs . " " Well , let 's go upstairs . That 's where we 're going , is n't it ? " Chantal looked as if she had been slapped in the face . I did n't care . She half-opened her mouth . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because I was ready to tell her to go to hell and leave . If she had gotten indignant and put on her Countess look and started yapping , I would have . I had n't intended to insult her . But I was plenty mad . Her secretiveness and her hedging and her lying did n't make any sense , if she really meant for me to help her . And they had very nearly gotten the hell beaten out of me . But she did n't . Instead , quietly , almost demurely , she got to her feet . Shyly , almost like a girl  --  which seemed silly to me , after Freddy Tarkoff , and that husband of hers , and God knew who all else  --  she led the way inside and upstairs , turning on and off the lights for us as we went . A couple of times she motioned me for silence . In the arched , thick-walled living room , I paused a minute , glass in hand , and looked again at the portrait of her when she was younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just what the hell was the matter with her , anyway ? In her bedroom , without a word , her back to me , she began to undress . She took off the summer dress , and the half-slip she wore under it , and hung them up neatly . She did it modestly , quietly , matter of factly , elegantly , with no coyness , just as she might have if she had been alone . Ip130stood and watched her and felt my mad slipping away out of me . She was elegant as hell and I admired it . I noted she had thought to have an ice bucket and booze and glasses on a tray on her dressing table . Whatever else about her , she had real class . Class up to her eyebrows . " You 'll have to be careful of me , " I said with a grin . I could catch glimpses of the front of her in the mirrors . " Yes . I just bet every woman has to be careful with you . You look as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty sore " " I 'm afraid you 'll have to leave at daylight . I 'm sorry about that .

" " About those three men . " She took whatever pins there were in her hair out and shook it loose . " What three men ? Oh , them . I do n't know . " I was still catching glimpses of her in the three angled mirrors . She had a beautiful dark bush . Then she turned around facing me . " You 're really very tough . Are n't you . " Then , the voice softening , and mocking , " Are n't you ? Very tough ? " " Sure . I took a course in it at school , " I said . " I do n't feel very tough at this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A funny little shy smile played at the corner of her mouth . " Now , more than any time . " Lithely , without haste , she walked to the bed and curled down onto it . She stretched out on top of the cover and then , with a curious little modesty that had great class , crossed her ankles . Just the ankles . And there she was . She still had a marvelous body . The whole thing was the most elegant damn thing I thought I 'd ever seen . " Will you be tough with me ? " I put my glass down somewhere , and began getting outp131of my own clothes with a style which , if not as elegant , I hoped at least complemented hers . It was the least I could do . Fortunately , I was not one of those men who at almost fifty had to hold in their stomachs and breathe shallow . " You 're beautiful , Lobo , " she said from the bed . " Beautiful ? Beautiful is hardly the word for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . But it 's always good to tell them that . When I had an arm around her she turned to me , chest on chest , and smiled . A large , tremulous smile . It had a certain radiance . " Beautiful ? An old woman like me ? I 'm an old woman . Or very nearly am . I used to be beautiful . " I kissed her to shut her up . She was as elegant in the bed as she had been getting into it . There was n't anything new that either of us could teach the other . But her love-making had the same style and class as the rest of her . I did n't mind if she squeezed my sore ribs . I did n't mind if she rubbed her head against my facial abrasions . I did n't mind if I got a little salt in my cut lip . I do n't suppose I had ever been to bed with a woman before who could be elegant and animal at the same time . I woke just shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal alarm in my head . The bedside lamp was still on , my empty drink glass besideit . I took it to the bottle and poured myself a measured drink . There was no drink in the world like that one , when after a night of satisfactory love-making you are preparing to get dressed and go home from some lady 's private apartment . I took it back to the bed with me and sat down to savor it . When I finished it , I kissed her gently on the cheek and stood up . When I stood up , her arm came out , and her hand grabbed me by my handle . Still half asleep , her eyes still shut , she said , " Do n't take him away , " and yawned.  | " It 's just about dawn , " I said . " Then goodbye , darling , call me this afternoon , " and she rolled over , with a look of deep satisfaction about her shouldersand her back . I started to dress . Then I was outside , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But outside I was n't so happy , nor so gentle feeling . I knew I should n't be gettinginvolved with any woman . Especially any woman who kept hedging her bets , and would n't tell me what she was really into . She was supposed to be my client . And now I 'd accepted my fee . Passing a hanging branch of a flowering tree drooping over a wall , I took a sudden savage , angry punch at it , scattering petals . The blush of first light was just mounting in the east , over the sea and the black bulky islands . I could see it all from up here . Now and then I could see the yacht harbor below me . By the time I got there the real dawn was growing . The taverna was opening , fishermen were stopping by for a coffee their oars on their shoulders , boats were coming in from night fishing . I stood for a while at the top of my rented garden , inside the upper street door , and looked at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was always such a great new false hope for everybody . At the start of each new day 's dawn . It was n't a humanemotional thing so much as a fact of nature . I walked clown to the taverna for a coffee myself . When I sat down and looked out at the harbor , I noticed the empty space the Agoraphobe had left in the harbor moorings . That guy sure liked to do his port making and putting out in the dead of night . I gave Sonny Duval half an hour . When the half hour was up , I rowed out to the boat and knocked on the hull . It was n't Sonny who came up , but Jane Duval . She was just putting on the pants of her bikini . She already had thep133bra on . Jim Kirk had not been kidding me about her body . It was magnificent , and young . Young , young , young . " Tell Sonny I 'm waiting at the taverna , " I told her brusquely . " Is n't it kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched and yawned , and I realized she was aware I was looking at her body . So she stretched it for me and showed it to me . " I told him I wanted to go early , " I said and shoved the skiff off and set the standing-up-type oars . " Well , I 'll tell him , " she said and went back down below . I did n't like her any better than I ever had . I rowed back angrily to the dock . When Sonny came up on deck , I called to him to get the boat ready , and to get a lunch at the taverna . We were going out together , alone . But first I wanted to go to town and buy some stuff . At the house I changed . No one was up . Sonny was at the taverna , but the rest of the boats slept on their anchorlines . I caught myself looking hungrily out at the water . In town I bought myself a mask and snorkel , flippers and a speargun . And a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town that handled masks to find the depth gauge . " No people , " I said to Sonny as we headed out . " No peopleall day . " Sonny grinned . " People are always trouble , " he informed me . " And they never give a warning . The sea , " he said and spread his arm , " the sea always gives you warning before the trouble . " I thought that was pretty pompous . Especially since I 'd learned he did n't even do his own dirty work . The big peace medal hanging on his chest on its rawhide cord caught the sun and glinted at me . " What did you do to your face ? " he asked . " I bumped it on my electric razor , " I said.  |p134We  spent that whole day out . We anchored off a tiny islet Sonny knew about to the east and did n't move except to change the boat . I avoided thinking about Chantal . I spearfished , or loafed and rested in the shade of the tarp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his battery-operated radio . I kept having to tell him to turn it down . He dived a little , but it was clear right away he was no adept with flippers or speargun , and had no interest in it . This was Tarkoff 's " expert spearfisherman " . I tried hard to reach 6o feet . I had set 6o feet as an arbitrary limit because I thought I ought to be able to do that . Though I had n't done any , for four years . But the best I could do was 40 or 45 . My new depth gauge was calibrated in meters and I kept having to recalculate into feet how deep I 'd been . It was a pretty disheartening performance . The bottom was n't very interesting . There were few fish . My whole catch was two medium-sized grouper . I looked at them ruefully on the deck when we packed it up to go in , and commented that there were n't many fish . " Boom , boom , " Sonny said . " The local fishermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the big fish . They know nothing about ecology or conservation . " Sonny was against spearfishing for sport , too . I made no comment . I was feeling grim enough already . " Education is very important to understanding , " Sonny said . But when he fired up the motor , I looked around at thep135sea and the rocky little islet with real regret . Frustrating as it was , it still seemed the best moments I had spent since I got here . The being without people was the best part . Being without Sonny would have been even better . Unfortunately , he owned the boat . By the time we got back to the taverna dock I knew what I was going to do about Chantal . I waited until we had cleaned up . But then I went straight in to the telephone booth at Dmitri 's and called her at her house and told her not to expect me at her dinner . There was a pause at her end . " Again ? " she said . " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you be coming by my house later , then ? " " I 'm afraid I wo n't be able to . Something 's come up . I 'm sorry . " Silence from Chantal . Then , finally , " You 're a great one for letting people down easy . " I did n't answer . " Shall I call you tomorrow , then ? " she said . " Yes . That 's a good idea . Call me in the morning . " " All right . Goodbye . " The phone clicked dead . I must have come out with a savage look on my face . Old Dmitrios looked at me , anyway . Relief was what I felt , suddenly . With the anger , relief . I took a couple of deep breaths of the relief . Sonny was battening down the boat . I told him I would let him know later what time I wanted to go out tomorrow . I went back to the house and changed . Then I just went out and walked in the town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt great . It was not yet six o'clock . At the yacht harbor a group of night fishermen were preparing to go out . At the Port breakwater another group of night fishermen were preparingtheir boats . In between , at the two bathing beaches , people were having an evening swim . The cafe terrace was crowded . The old-fashioned nineteenth-century Britishp136hotel on the water across the Port harbor had two parties of English middle class out in front having drinks , almost lost in the vastness of its terrace . Finally I came to the Xenia . Xenia was the same name used for a whole chain of government-owned hotels on all the islands and all over Greece . This was the one I had seen from the ferry coming in . Just beyond it was the hill with the Construction where the hippies lived . Smoke from open fires rose from it in columns . I decided to go there . The entrance was around the headland on the road , where there was a little cove and a beach . I walked right in . Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a sullen cold shoulder from the hippies , not all of whom were young . If I asked directions or information , I got sullen grudging replies . It was all like some weird , crazy surrealistic Hooverville . They were cooking their suppers over the open fires . A goodly number of filthy children were running around withoutdiscipline . Toilet facilities were nowhere visible ; people went trudging off with shovels in their hands . Open constructionditches still passed before or behind , or both , many of the four- and six-family units . People either jumped them or climbed down into them and up out of them and over the hump of earth on the other side . When I had looked it over to my satisfaction , I left . I did not see Steve or Chuck and their gang anywhere . I did not receive any welcoming rapport of brotherhood . Back out on the road I stopped a moment . I was curious all of a sudden as to what it was that had irked me so . I had nothing against camping out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a shovel to dig my own toilet . I did believe that children needed discipline . More , that they actually craved it , desired it . But that difference of opinion could n't account for my truculence . What put my back up was the sense of unfriendly superiority . They put camping-out up onto a level of moral righteousness like a religious mysti/cism , and then sullenly waited hopefully for you to hate them and martyr them for it . Down below where I stood on the road , through the foliage , I noticed the little beach below had a number of late bathers in the evening , fading light . Almost without exception they were nude . A few girls wore the pants of bikinis . A number of children , washed clean by the sea , were running naked and screaming . The girls ' nude bodies , long and lean with youth , were exquisitely beautiful in the red light . From where I stood , it was an exquisite beautiful scene through the leaves . Old man that I was , I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pain . This scene was something I had never had . I was too warped by my parents ' , and my society 's , foolishness . Maybe I was oversexed because of that but the scene had an enormously haunting sexual beauty for me . I wanted to have each girl . Then I recognized Sweet Marie as one of the girl bathers . Marie was one with nothing on . The dark V of her crotch was tantalizingly attractive . Taller than most , she had a long lean rounded line of flank . After a few moments of watching her in particular through my screen of leaves , I turned away back to the road . I felt put down , left behind , out of everything , pretty damned ancient . Right in front of me a group in their weird outfits were strolling back from town . Three boys and two girls . The tallestboy grinned at me . " What are you doing , old dad ? Catching up on your peeping ? " They all laughed . I did n't say anything . I went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Another act of gratuitous human cruelty . Who cared ? I was used to it . At least it got my adrenal juices to flowing again . By the time I got back to the Xenia Hotel it was dark . Stake lights were on in its grounds , which contained large clumps of tropical jungle garden . The gravelled road ranp138through the edge of its grounds . On an impulse I turned and walked up the stake-lighted walk to the lobby . Inside , the lush new hotel was weirdly empty . A massive , expensively done ground floor was totally deserted . In the dining room one lone couple was eating . One clerk stood behind the reception . He had on a green uniform with gold braid . I asked him for the bar . He pointed for me . I followed his finger , down a long luxe corridor-like room with expensive gaming tables down each side , the whole done in rich green and white marble . Every other gaming table light was on , and not a soul sat at any of them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost unreal . Beyond the gaming tables was an equally luxe open patio , equally deserted . The bar was on the right . A young lone barman leaned against the wall with his arms folded , smoking , in the same green and gold braid uniform . I went over . " A Scotch and soda , " I said . He put down his cigarette and mixed the drink with a professional flourish , without a word . I crawled up onto a stool and drank and then stared down into the wide glass as if it were some crystal ball of my future . If it was , it did n't tell me anything . I looked back up . " You do n't seem to have much business . " The boy shrugged contemptuously . He had picked back up his cigarette , and refolded his arms . " There will be some more in August , " he said in perfect English . " How does everybody stay alive until August ? " With the same contempt he said , " We are paid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . We were all trained in the school in Mikonos . " The irony was too heavy , and without any humor . I did n't grin . This whole place was like that . I swung around and , elbows on the bar , looked around at the empty , expensively lit patio . A tiny bellboy in the same green with yellow braid , butp139with a green and gold pillbox hat , walked by and smiled at me . He was the only one with any energy I had seen in the place . He went on off the edge of the patio . I swung back around and hunched over the bar . Just at that second there was a strangled , terrorized yell from the garden . Both the barman and I jumped . The little bellboy came scrambling up the steps out of the dark , gabbling Greek . Behind the bar the barman gripped the edge of the counter . " What 's he saying ? " I said . The tiny boy went into English . " Please ! Come ! A dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He has no head ! " I got him by his arm . His eyes had dilated so that I did n't think he could even see me . " Okay . Just take it easy . Take it easy . Come on . Show me , " I said . He led me to the edge of the patio and the steps , and then stopped . " I ca n't , " he whispered . He came up exactly to my elbow . He could n't have been over nine . " Then point where , " I said . For a minute I thought he could n't even do that . Then the little boy pointed out into the dark to a clump of jungle grass . Behind me the young barman made no move to come out from behind his bar and help . " For Christ 's sake , come here and hold onto this kid , " I called . " He 's scared out of his wits . " I patted his shoulder , and went down into the dark onto the Bermuda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't see anything in the darkness . Then just inside the clump I spotted a bare foot . I parted the tall grass and peered inside . Beyond the foot was a leg , and beside that another leg drawn up , and beyond that was the body . Where the neck should have been there was nothing . For half a minute I just stood and looked at it . The neck had been cut off at the base , and whoever had done it had not done a very good job of it . In the darkness it was im/possible to see if there was blood on the ground , or on the grass . I stepped a little farther in and felt the grass near the severed neck and looked at my fingers . There was n't any blood . I stepped back out . The no blood meant that the killing had not been done here , in the clump . That did not necessarily mean the head would not be here , though . I looked around , and found the sandal that belonged on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not find the head . I was glad , because I thought I already knew who it was . I came back to the edge of the clump beside the bare foot and stood looking at the body again . There was something very familiar about it . There was a bulge in one of the hip pockets . I snaked the wallet out without touching anything else and took a look at it . A mariner 's card stared back at me in the gloom of the bad light with Girgis 's picture on it . There was plenty of money in the wallet . I snaked the wallet back and stood up . Behind me off the patio some American dance music was playing softly on the hotel 's intercom speaker system . It was as if I had known all along that it was going to happen . I had n't known when , and I had n't known who , and I had n't known where , or how . And there was n't a damned thing in the world I could have done to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like this from the start . And now here we were . It was an especially gruesome one . I was pretty sure the head had been cut off after the body was dead . It just looked like it . But that did n't make any difference . There was a special indignity about mutilation of that sort . There was something specially pathetic and indecent about the bare feet of a corpse , too . I had seen that before , and knew about it . A guy who had been blown out of his shoes and socks by a big mortar shell in my war . It was funny until you remembered the guy was dead . I had seen decapitations before , too . We had had some men in myp141outfit decapitated by the Japanese and left with their heads sitting on their chests for us to find . I suddenly remembered Girgis standing in his bare feet on his afterdeck in the heavy sun , getting ready to blow his klaxon . The bare feet had looked all right then . I had n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive about him , bad boy or not . I did n't hate death . There was n't much point in that . But I hated wanton death . And murder was almost always wanton death . I could n't figure it out . It did n't seem there was enough money in his paltry little hashish smuggling to warrant any murder . Behind me the young barman , courageous enough now , in my wake , said from the patio steps , " One is not supposed to touch anything at the scene of a murder , is one ? " I moved my head irritably . " That 's right . Come on , let 's go to the desk . " " Is he really dead ? " he said . " With no head ? " " He 's dead , all right , " I said . Beside him , in his green and gold uniform and his green and gold pillbox hat , the little bellboy began to cry . In the lobby I told the clerk to call the police . While we waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellboy trying to comfort him . " There , now , there , now . Dead peoplenever hurt anybody . Did you ever hear of any dead people hurting anybody ? " I was n't at all sure what I was telling him was the truth.  |p142I  hated a killing . A killing always complicated everything . Once a killing got into a case , it became a whole different ball game . Everything else was disturbed and disrupted , by a killing . The local beef trust got called in , and the heavy weaponry  --  the captains and inspectors  --  got requisitioned from upstairs . I did not presume it would be any different in Greece , and it was n't . The police arrived in their blue jeep , the fat chief and two of his young peasant constables . I had seen him at a distance around town . The chief went out to take a look at our body , and came back sweating and mopping his face . He was in over his depth already . He told us , in English , for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Inspector , in Glauros . " God only hope he are there , " he said . When he came back from the phone , he said the Inspectorwas coming . Should be there in an hour . I had my " client " to think of . I might have stood her up but I wanted to get to her with the news before anyone else did , and tell her to keep her mouth shut . I stood up brazenly . " Well , I have a few things to do in town . I 'll be back here by then . " " You ? You will not go anywhere . " " The fat chief 's eyes seemed to come back slowly from wherever they were . His two double chins shook with outrage . " You were seen to take the dead man 's wallet out of the pocket , and then put him back . " I smiled a tough , mean smile at the young barman . To thep143chief I said , " I thought I knew who he was . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crimes , " the chief said . " We shall search you . " Then he went into Greek . I put my hands in my pockets to turn them out . The chief immediately put his hand on his holstered gun and undid the flap . I simply grinned at him . I brought out what I had in my jacket . Then I started on my pants . " I ca n't stand to be tickled . Especially by hick cops . " " I know who you are , Mr. Davies , " the chief said . " This do n't give you no special priv'lege . " One of the younger cops picked up my wallet , looked at my special license , then handed it significantly to the chief . The chief looked at it , and nodded , and put it back . There was absolutely no reason for them to go through this kid routine . I figured they did it because they were scared . " Now can I go to town ? " I said . " You will stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inspector , when he arrived , walked in swiftly and took over smoothly . He did not look like he was yanked away from any quiet dinner , with his wife and seven little Greek kids . He was dressed in a dark blue suit that might have been smartly tailored , before he put it on . It was much too heavy for the weather . He was a small man , but inside his smallness he was heavy and florid . He had at least the authority of an Army colonel about him . He also had the most brutal and rudest set of eyes , nose and lips I 'd ever seen even on a cop . Absolutely power-oriented . After a quick look at the corpse , he closeted himself with the chief . I cooled my heels , and contented myself with staring down the slim sneaky barman . While the chief was with his boss , the barman was called in . When they both came back out , he asked for me . " Well , Mr. Davies . You seem to have upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wallet . " He was n't reproving . But he was n't on my side , either . I gave him a shrug . " I thought I recognized him . I was right . " I probably in all fairness should have warned him that I never did rate very high on obedience tests , even in the Army . " You knew the victim ? " Simply by sitting in it , he had turned the hotel manager 's office into his own property . " I 've met him . He seemed like a personable young man . He seemed to flash a lot of money around . " The Inspector nodded . He constructed a brutal smile with his loose lips . " A lot more than he could make just running the Polaris , " I said . He nodded again , with the same curled-lip little smile . " I 've heard more . More that I do n't actually know . " " Such as what ? " " Well , it 's rumored he was smuggling a lot of hash onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hippies up on the hill . " The sneery smile again . He was being nice to me . But he was n't sure whether he liked me or not . " That is my information , also . Though I am not sure all the hashish went to the ' ippies . Anything else ? " " Well , it seems the local authorities are unusually lax about it . " I thought I 'd give him a little needle . It was hard to tell how thick that skin was . It did n't faze him . " Mr. Davies . I can not control the hashish traffic in my own area on the mainland . They are an island here . It would take fifty men , each with his own boat . " " Sure , " I said . I figured I was safe enough to say it . " How much better to have knowledge of how much comes in and who brings it . " " Yes . " " There was no problem until the ' ippies came . Now eachp145year there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked like he ate well , the Inspector . " The word gets around . It is all because of the government housing constructionup above , where they can live . " " But nothing has been done about that . Right ? " " I would not attempt to discuss a complex matter like that with you . However , "  --  the loose-faced smile  --  " let me say that no matter how badly dressed and unwashed , no matter how squalidly they like to live , the ' ippies can spend an enormous amount of money in a place . " I smiled back . " Sure . They are not many of them poor . Right ? At least , not the American ones . " The Inspector nodded . " Do n't try to get nasty with me . They like to play at being poor , yes . " His loose-lipped smile could be more ominous than a tight-lipped one . " But murderis another thing , Mr. Davies . We 've had a few knifings , a few broken heads , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will get a murderer , in my district . That I can assure you . " Will it be that easy ? " The Inspector shrugged . " I suppose you have not also heard who sells the hashish for this man Girgis ? " I pretended to consider this . Why would he ask me , a three-day stranger , that ? I lied . " Nope . I have n't . I thought he sold it himself . " He smiled and fiddled with the hotel manager 's pencil , which had become his pencil . " Do you know the Countess von Anders ? " " Yes . She 's the lady who 's been taking care of me on the island . You do n't mean to imply she could be mixed up in this tawdry mess ? " The Inspector looked up , his heavy eyebrows raised . " Certainly not . I have known the Countess for years , Mr. Davies . " " Then why the leading question ? " " No leading question , Mr. Davies . I simply wondered ifp146you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of Mr. Tarkoff . You did some work for Mr. Tarkoff in Athens . Mr. Tarkoff sent you here . " " Well , she met me , really , " I said , indifferently . He kept up with things , the Inspector . He did homework . " Fred Tarkoff wrote her about me , and gave me a letter of intro to her . " " Yes . Mr. Tarkoff . The rich American . I have had the pleasure of meeting him a couple of times . Tsatsos has severalrich Americans . We like them . " It was impossible to tell which way he was playing it . Did he know about the hashish group , and intend to attack them ? Or was he being paid off , and was protecting them ? He pushed the hotel manager'sswivel chair back as if that was his , too . " This is not an interrogation , Mr. Davies . Okay . That will be all . You can go . " And you do n't want me to leave the island , " I grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't need you any more . " Not the greatest sense of humor in the world . The two of us walked outside to the lobby . The three constabulary were not there , and the hotel employees were standing in the big glass doorway watching whatever was going on outside . We walked to the door . Outside on the driveway was parked a sun-faded blue Volkswagen bus , its back door open . Beside it stood a tiny old Greek man , so fragile lookinghe seemed transparent . The two young constables and the chief were holding a stretcher , and arguing . I looked at the Inspector , and the Inspector 's powerstructuredeyebrows quivered . " The local hearse , " he said . " And the local mortician . " One of the young constables was protesting about something in Greek . The fat chief overrode him . They all disappeared behind the clump of tropical grass . In a couple of minutes they reappeared with the body on the stretcher ,  |p147a  blanket over the body . The body was in rigor mortis and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn-up leg stuck up like a small mountain . One arm stuck out from under the blanket stiffly . It was obvious they had had some trouble with it and all three were sweating . They heaved it up into the bus and the tiny transparent mortician shut the door . The young constable who had done all the arguing went over and leaned against a tree and began to vomit . " You can see they are not used to murders on the island , " the Inspector said behind me . I nodded . " Have you got all the fingerprints and stuff , already ? " " All that we will need around Tsatsos , " the Inspector said . I nodded again . I gave him a grim handshake meant to show I understood his problems , and went to the line of horsecabs . My " client " Chantal was still the first thing on my mind . I had to call the driver away from the row of spectators . In the Port I paid off the cab , and walked up to Chantal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10:30 . I did not expect her to be home , and she wasn't.  |p148I  told the maid I would wait . In the low stone thick-walled living room I looked again at the portrait of the young Chantal . I thought it said a lot about her life , hanging there with its light that was never turned off . It dominated the medieval room . Not that she had centered everything around it . She had n't . She had hung it off by itself , and then directed everything away from it . So that it dominated by indirection . Very shrewd . On an antique table I picked up an expensive illustrated picture-book history of the von Anders family , in German . Obscure publisher . 300 numbered copies . Obviously , a paidforbook . I settled down with it . Might as well learn something about my client , if I could . The illustrations went all the way back to medieval engravings . Castles . Ancestors in armor . Later , photographs . War of 187o . War of 1918 . War of 1940 . Periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait , in which I recognized Chantal , and a guy I assumed was her husband , amongst brothers , sisters , cousins , nieces and nephews . And the stern old patriarchal couple . Quite a family . I still found it difficult to appreciate Germans . I mixed myself a drink , and went back to the book . I dozed a little . Finally , I heard a door slam outside , some whispering . Chantal came in . " What a pleasant surprise , " she said , much too sweetly . " So you did decide to visit me after all . " I deliberately did n't get up . I slid the book on the table . " I see you 've been reading up on Gunther 's family his/tory . It 's quite an array of Germans , is n't it ? " she added , bitterly , " German nobility . I think there 's even one of me in there . " " I saw it . " " I did n't know you read German . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made herself a drink and sat . I said nothing . I studied her openly . I had to admit she was charming , as she blew a strand of hair back out of her eyes and looked at me . " To what do I owe this great good fortune ? Did the other one stand you up ? Or did you feel you had to leave her side through pity and come and see me . At least , I am getting to know your preferences . You like them very young , and very long-legged . You like skindiving dope pushers . " " Pots calling kettles , " I said . " Just take it easy . I 'm here onbusiness . Serious business , for you . " I paused . " Do you know that Girgis has been killed ? Murdered ? " Chantal 's face grew pinched . " You 're not serious ? " I nodded . " I found him . Well , me and a couple of hotel kids . In the bushes at the Xenia . And the only way we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there was n't any head on the body . " " Oh , but that 's horrible , " she whispered after a moment . She was n't acting this time . " Horrible or not , " I said . I sighed silently , and blew out my lips . I got up and busied myself making myself a drink to give her a little time . " So , " I said , my back to her , " I 'm here as your representative . To tell you to keep your mouth shut . About Girgis and everything you might know about Girgis . " I sat back down . " I thought it important enough to come right away . I feel a certain moral responsibility for you . Since you hired ' me . " She did n't seem as though she was sure she had heard me . Her face was white , and she had her hands to her cheeks and was staring off across the corner of the floor . I lookedp150at her closely . They will sometimes suddenly get sick all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies like her . I got up and poured her a shot of brandy . " Here . " She took it and looked at it and then drank half of it . " I 'm , uh  --  . I 'm all shocked . It 's hard to believe . I do n't know what to say . I ca n't understand it . Why would somebody want to do that to him ? " " I do n't know . I do n't care . Drink the rest of that . It 's not any of it my affair . Except to protect you and help you keep out of it as much as they will let you . Of course , they may not even bother you . " " But cutting off his head ? Why do a horrible thing like that ? " " I admit the head part 's pretty gruesome . I have n't the slightest idea about why , " I said . She drained off the rest of the snifter of brandy . " What 's going to happen ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you might be able to tell me more about that than I can . " Chantal swung around in her chair to look at me , and set the glass down . " Well , surely you do n't think I did it ? " " No . Not unless you 're a lot stronger than you look . There was almost no blood near the body . That means somebody had to carry Girgis quite a way . And he is n't small . Even without his head . " I grinned bleakly at her . " You 're horrible . You have no sensitivity at all . " " It 's all been knocked out of me over the years . " I peered at her over my glass . " Now , are you going to do what I tell you ? " " Well , naturally , I 'll do what you tell me . " " Good . " I put aside my glass and got up . " First , do n't talk to the police or any of your friends . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place between you and Girgis . And that means everything . " Chantal leaped to her feet . " I 've told you a hundredp151times . " But she stopped when I seized her by the elbows , and squeezed her just a little . " I said I meant everything . And I 'm perfectly capable of shaking it out of you , if I have to . " I moved her gently back and forth . " So start . I think you 've been working for him , in some capacity . So does Inspector Pekouris , I would bet . " Chantal 's head drooped and she looked at the floor . But now she was acting again , I suspected . " Well , it 's true . I have been . I was his contact ' , his carrier ' , for my friends on the island who wanted hash . " Her face brightened . " You 'd be surprised . There 's a lot of them . Then she drooped again . " And  --  And I had an affair with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's all . " " Are you sure ? " " I did n't want to tell you that last part . You can appreciate that . I 'm not too proud of it . I 'm not too proud of either , for that matter . " " I think there 's more , " I said grimly . But I let her go . She sank onto the couch . " There is n't . " I shook my head slowly . " It does n't make sense that way . Not any way I can figure . " " He was blackmailing me with it ! How do you think I would feel to have people know I had an affair with that upstart fisherman ? That I was actually peddling hashish for him , and taking money for it ? " " Let 's start with that part . How did that happen ? " I said . " It was simple enough . I winter in Paris every year . I leave here in November , and I come back in March . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That takes money . If you ca n't afford to pay me fifteen hundred dollars , and you need money from Girgis , how can you afford to winter in Paris every year ? " She just sort of looked at me and went on . I did n't think it was a good idea to stop her.  | " I smoked hashish in Paris . Everybody does . And I liked it , so I thought I 'd try and buy some here . I asked Girgis one time , when I was renting his boat for a party , and we were discussing the arrangements . He said he 'd sell me some . People smoked it at my place , and asked me if I could get them some . It just sort of happened . I never went around with it soliciting . They always came and asked me . When Girgis realized it , he was pleased . It opened up a new market for him . He said if I would handle it for him , talk about it , promote it sort of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds like a lot . " " Actually , he said zo percent at first . But I held out for 40 . I looked at her in disbelief , then had to laugh . I shook my head . " I thought you did n't need the money . " " I always need money . " " I thought you got a big alimony . " She made a helpless gesture . " I entertain a lot . It goes . Honestly I do n't know where it goes . " " And you can still afford to winter in Paris ? All right , what about the affair ? " I said . Chantal looked appealingly helpless , like a small child caught at something innocently bad . " Actually , I 'd rather not talk about that . " " Okay , " I said . " Do n't talk about it . " " It happened at the beginning of last summer . In the spring , really . When I came back . I had been working ' for Girgis for a year . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freddy had sort of left me . Well , I had always known he would . I expected him to . But it hurts just the same . And Girgis was there . I saw him a good bit because of the hashish . And he is good looking . " She paused . I did n't say anything . " He came here a few times , very late at night . We met in chapels in the hills . In the woods . Sometimes on the main/land , back in from Glauros . It was all so sort of exciting , at first . For me . The selling hashish part , too . It was a lark . " For a woman who did n't want to talk about it , I thought she was doing a very good job . " But as a lover , he was a good bit of a peasant , " Chantal said , and looked at me . For a second I could n't believe it . It was so outrageous and such a ploy . I wondered what she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then had to laugh . " Is that supposedto imply that I am not ? " She looked at me a long moment . " Well , yes . It is , " she said defiantly . " If you insist that I spell it out for you . Anyway , why not ? It 's the truth . " I did not react . I was still trying to sniff out the truth of the whole thing . There was something wrong with it somewhere . But I could n't put my finger on it . " What happened to stop it ? " I said . " He started to blackmail me , " Chantal said promptly . She was incredible . But then , she went on . " And I was tired of him . Oh , I 'm sure he was tired of me , too . But I told him I wanted to stop working for him . " She seemed to perk up suddenly . " You see , that was what the blackmail was . He was n't blackmailing me only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . " There was a silence . She seemed to be waiting for me to react . I pursed my lips . " Well , you 're out of it now . Stay out . " Another silence . " Do you think they 'll try to involve me ? " " Honestly , I do n't think they will . But that 's what I do n't know . If they go digging deep into his hashish operations , you might become involved . Who else knows about all this ? " " No one . No one at all . " " How about that Greek sidekick of his , that works on the Polaris with him ? " She shook her head.  | " How about Kirk ? " Suddenly she had an odd alert look about her , like that of a startled deer . " That was why I wanted to tell you first , " I said . " If there was any shock . It 's a good thing I did . If you reacted like you did . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to tell you not to say anything . To anyone . About any of it . " " Were you planning on staying ? " Chantal said . " I mean , after you finished your business ? " I turned my head to look at her . Actually , I had n't been . I thought I had made up my mind on that in the afternoon , when I had called her . But it took a lot of balls , or whatever the feminine equivalent , for her to come right out and ask me . I knew damn well she was n't doing it to pay me anything . For all my trouble . I remembered the satisfaction her back showed last night when she rolled over to go back to sleep . She just liked to have a man around . Chantal swung on me suddenly . " Let me tell you something about you , " she said , defiantly . " Why ca n't you just screw me and stop worrying ? You Americans are all so much alike . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . I have n't asked you for anything , have I ? Why do you Americans all have to go through all this selftorture ? You all have had the same thing beaten into your heads by somebody . " I had to grin . I hoped my face did n't look haggard . " You 're absolutely right , " I said . I nodded . " You are . Ab-solutely . " " Well ? " " Yes , " I said . " I was . In actual fact . I was thinking about staying . " " And that 's what you 've been standing there brooding about so lugubriously ? " she demanded.  |p155Actually  , it was n't . Actually , I had been thinking about that nude bathing scene I had witnessed so long ago , this evening . Sweet Marie sweetly nude , and all those other girls nude , and all of it . Youth . What was it about a young body ? Why did a young body seem so much better than an old body ? " Yes . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying because I was afraid of becoming too involved with you . " " Well , do n't . I would n't have you on a platter . As a husband . And you do n't have to be afraid of me . " She came across to me , and crept herself into my arms . " I 'm glad you 're staying . I 'm all shaken up . I 'm a little scared . " I looked down at her , and then , gently , wrapped her up in my big strong manly arms . I was pretty sure it was going to be as elegantly animal tonight as it had been last night . I was n't disappointed.  |p156My  Greek housekeeper woke me at 8:15 by knocking on the bedroom door to tell me Inspector Pekouris was waiting downstairs to see me . Over a scalding cup of her powerful Greek coffee while I shaved in the bathroom down the hall , I called down to him I would be with him in five minutes . As I stretched my face in the mirror I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my porch , looking at the prettiness of the harbor . But he was n't enjoying it . His attitude stated emphatically that he personally allowed these grown-up children to be out there , to water-ski and play with their sailboats . " This is a professional call of courtesy , " Pekouris said in his brutal way . " We are going to have a look for the head . I thought you would enjoy to come along . " Down in the road he had parked the blue police jeep in the edge of the vacant lot . " Well , it 's nice of you to ask me , " I said . " But I do n't know what I could do . " " I do not expect you to do anything . I thought you would be interested . As one professional from another . " He gave me a look . If I was supposed to understand what it meant , I was flunking the course . " Well , if you put it that way , " I said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell my boat guy . " Sonny was at the taverna . I told him I would n't need him and that he could take the day off . Then I climbed into the blue jeep beside Pekouris . I did n't feel fully awake yet . Butp157I was awake enough to wonder what had earned me this special treatment . Pekouris stopped along the way for a cup of coffee , but did not enlighten me . It was another lovely day like the others . They did n't seem to have anything else in Tsatsos . The Inspector seemed to visibly enjoy driving the jeep . We drove in the open jeep along the main road that ran behind the Port , and out the other side of the town toward the Xenia and the hilltopConstruction . The breeze blew the short sleeves of my sport shirt . InspectorPekouris had his same blue suit on , or another like it . But at least he had changed his tie . " You think there 's any chance of finding it ? The head ? " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm to look . It might tell us something . Or , we might find something else . One thing is certain . The actual killing had to take place not too far away . " " You mean like maybe up at the Construction ? " He shrugged . " As you saw , rigor mortis was fully established . The doctor places the time of death at around 3 A.M. the previous morning . Leaving about an hour and 45 minutestill dawn . Someone had to carry the body to the Xenia garden , crossing at least one major road , and deposit it where it was found . All in the hour and a half before first light . " " Not an easy job , " I said . " No , not easy at all . Do not forget he had also to dispose of the head . " We had reached the Xenia . In the hotel " parking lot " where the horsecabs usually stood there was a cluster of vehicles : two autos , several horse-drawn wagons . Just beyond it , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Construction hill , a group of men milled about . The Inspector pulled into the lot . " Oh , something else . Kronitis . Mr. Leonid Kronitis . Do you know him ? "  | " No . " But the name certainly made me alert . " I received a telephone call from him early this morning , before I left Glauros , " Pekouris said . " I was asked to give you a message . He would like to see you some time today , if that is possible . He requests you to telephone him about it . Here . " He handed me a slip of paper with the number . I took it , and studied it , and waited . But Inspector Pekouris said nothing more . He occupied himself with parkingthe jeep . When he cut the motor , he turned back to me . He still did n't say anything . " Who is this Kronitis ? " " He has , shall we say , Mr. Davies , minor interests in Tsatsos . He loves the island and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected gentleman . Who has a big villa over behind Glauros . " I got one of his lippy smiles . " Should I go see him ? " Pekouris 's power-tuned eyebrows went up . " You ask me ? " " You gave me the message . " " I see no reason why you should not go see him . He is a very respected man . Also , he owns Polaris . Which our dead friend was master of . " He smiled again . " Maybe he wants to hire you to find his killer . " " Nobody seems to want to believe I 'm down here on vacation , " I said . The Inspector did n't answer that . Again , I had the feeling he was not saying everything he knew , the Inspector . Or maybe he was one of those who did n't want to know what he knew . That way nothing could be held against him ? " You recommend I go , " I said , finally . " I recommend nothing . " I gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open-eyed , completely expressionless face . Usually , his eyes seemed half closed . " But I see no reason why not . Shall we go over ? " he said and nodded his head toward the group of men.  |p159We  walked it . At the curve the fat chief was supervising the work . He seemed to find me more acceptable , since his boss had given him the word . I had found out since meetingthem last night , from Chantal , that all the police in Greece came vaguely under the military , and that the local constabulary were in reality Army militiamen . The Inspectorwas an Army officer . This did not particularly endear them to me . I got the picture of the job in progress right away . The insweepingcurve of the road contoured a sharp little ravine ; which below dropped to a small rocky unserviceable inlet of the sea , and above rose in a steep grassy draw . Up on the grassy draw a long line of local peasants and fishermen were working their way upward halfway up the steep slope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Construction was ; and some of its units with their spindle stilt legs encroached right out onto the steep grass . The right of the peasant line came almost to them . In amongst the units , as if unwilling to venture beyond their line , some of the hippies had come out to watch . There must have been forty of them : the men with their long hair and beards and bizarre clothes ; the women will their longer hair , and the characteristic part in the center and their ugly shapeless long dresses or dirty jeans . The ) appeared to feel menaced by the search . They were very quiet . The men stood with their arms hanging . Occasion ally a woman moved or murmured to quiet a child . The were a pretty unprepossessing-looking lot , not at all attractive ; but somehow familiar . Then I remembered . They made me think of the pictures of the people in the German camps . Although they were here by choice , I did n't like the feelingand the implications that gave me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly was n't bothered . Up above when the peasants and fishermen of the linep160passed near them , they stared at the hippies and did not speak . There was a definite antagonism , on both sides . Standing at the bottom I looked the disposition over . Its point reached me quickly enough . " What if you find nothing in the ravine ? " I asked . " Will you search the Construction ? " " We will have to , " Pekouris said . " But I doubt if we will find much evidence in there . " " No , " I said , staring up at the hippies . I did n't know what else to call them , but hippies . I knew they did n't like the term . And I knew it had become pretty much passe . But Georgina called them that , and they even called themselves that , on occasion . They certainly were n't all students . Not far away in a group of the hippies I suddenly saw the blond-maned Steve and his girl Diane , and Sonny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the tiny knoll they were on . I started up to them . " Hello ! What are you doing here ? " Sonny smiled . " You gave me the day off , " he said amicablyenough , in the tone of a man who does n't really have to work for you . " We came to be with our people , " Jane Duval said in a clarion voice from behind him , and stepped forward . The runny nosed , not very clean three-year-old was clinging to her long skirt and she put an arm around it protectively . Her face was a study in self-righteous rage . Black angers roiled behind her frowning eyes like storm clouds , seeking an object . " We might as well tell each other the real truth for once . We felt our place was here with them . " She looked at me with a kind of aloof defiance . " Would you rather we cowered in town while our friends are terrorized ? " My face became a patient mask . I did n't answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's faces before , all over America . And like Jane , they never seemed to know where to direct it , either . The other girl , Diane , beside Jane ,  |p161had  it too . There was a profound hurt in the subtle twist of the brows , as well as the outrage . A deep unhealing wound  --  or so they seemed to think . When no one else spoke , Jane Duval said , " Are you the one who initiated this new terrorization ? " " I 'm afraid you 'll have to go to Inspector Pekouris , the Police Inspector , for that , " I said politely . " I just came along for the ride . " I pointed , " He 's right down there . " Jane 's lips writhed as she said , " Fat chance ! And it 's easy to see which side of the line your feet are on , Mr. Davies , in this new infringement of the rights of our people . " I remained stolid . " I do n't know if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government is willing to donateyou . They own this joint . " " Our rights are the rights of being alive , " Jane said . " In my book that gets you the right to breathe air , " I said grimly , but politely . " And nothing more . " If you can find the air , " I added . " In your book , " Jane Duval cried . " The book of the Establishment . " Beside her the grubby child began to cry . I said , " Is that the way they read it at Bennington ? You 're scaring the kid . Maybe you did n't hear , but there 's been a murder . They 're trying to find the murdered man 's head . ' " We heard ! And the next step  --  the real purpose  --  will be mass deportation of the hippies almost surely . But don 's think you 're fooling us , any . " " It might be at that , " I said with a stony humor . I 'd talked to so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very close to this place . " Look , " I said to Sonny . " I came up here to tell you I want you this morning . I 'll need the boat . " Before he could answer yes or no , Jane moved to him anc wilting , buried her face searchingly  --  suckingly like suckling infant  --  in the angle of his neck . As if it was all mor ( than she could bear . They formed a sort of staircase of an guish : the little girl with her face in Jane 's skirt : Jane withp162her face in Sonny 's neck : Sonny 's half angry face at the top . " Look . You do n't have to take me , " I said . " I 'll find somebody else . " " I 'll take you , I 'll take you , " Sonny said . His voice sounded anguished , half angry . " I 'll be at the dock in an hour . Half an hour . I hired out to you . All right ? " He sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if pulling them back out of the self-imposed zone of combat . Jane , without moving her face , and clinging like a leech , allowed herself to be pulled . Just then , at the top of the grassy draw , which a couple of men from the line had reached , there was a shout . Looking up , we could see the men waving . " They have found the blood , " the Inspector called up to me from below . " Do you want to come up ? " " No . That 's too much of a climb for a middle-aged man . " I turned back to the hippies . Steve and Diane were still there , with some others , but Sonny had drawn himself and his family back out . " You feeling oppressed , too ? " I said to Steve . " I do n't know . " The vague-eyed Steve looked at me , but appeared to be looking through me , as usual . " She 's probably right . It 's easier to blame it all on us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He put out his arm  --  because the silent Diane had started to move toward him , as if for protection . She crept into it . " They wo n't unless they find the murderer , " I said . " You mean they wo n't give us permission to leave ? " " I do n't know . Might not . " I looked around . " Where 's your sidekick ? Old Cyclops ? " " Oh , he 's around , " Steve said , too quickly . " He 's around , all right . Somewhere . " Rather thoughtlessly , he pushed the passive girl away from him . He took a step or two down towardme , lowered his voice . " Listen , did you tell any of them what you and I talked about in the square the other day ? "  | " I did n't tell anybody anything , " I said . " I 'm not in this . " " Well , thanks . " " Do n't thank me . Nobody asked me . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Especially under oath in front of a grand jury seeking an indictment , I 'd tell them . " " You would ? " " Under oath ? Sure . " " You give a damn about oaths ? " " Give a damn ? I care about my oath . " " That 's all crap . Establishment crap . Before God and my fellow man . ' You believe all that ? They want you to believe that . That 's their way of hooking you . I believe in taking their fucking oath , and telling them whatever you want . Establishment crap . " I simply looked at him . Finally I dropped my eyes and shook my head , in disbelief . " Lying under oath is also against the law , " I added . As if that meant anything . I might lie under oath myself someday , if it was absolutely necessary . But I never had yet . And I did n't hold to it as a righteousphilosophy . " Okay , pal , " Steve said , in a bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least we know where we stand . " He turned and collected his girl absently with his open arm , and moved away . I started down . " You know I did n't mean it , do n't you ? " he called after me , turning back around . I went on . He turned back to the other hippies . Behind me I heard someone coming down after me . It was Pete Gruner , the high-shouldered , bearded man from the night club . He had been up there with the hippies , apparently . Pete Gruner , the dropout cop . Or was he ? " Hey , Davies . Wait up , man . I want to talk to you . " " Talk to me later , " I said rudely over my shoulder . " I 've had a bellyful . Of talk . Up to here . " I went on down without looking back.  |p164Back  at the jeep I waited for the Inspector . I sat in the sunwarmdriver 's seat , fiddling with the faded wheel . For long moments I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . I seemed to be getting drawn in in spite of myself . The morning sun coming in through the trees turned the leaves a yellow-green . It made a hot incandescent halo for itself , passing through the tree branches . A light little breeze zephyred in under the trees to me from the open water below the hotel . Already , there was too much material to correlate . Too many people had done or said too many things . I could no longer even remember them all . I 'd have had to sit down with a couple of pads and spend a night making notes . Just like I did on a regular case . Steve and his buddy . Kirk 's vague hints . Chantal 's continuingreticence . Pekouris . Pete Gruner . This new man Kronitis . Nobody had hired me to work on any murder case . I was supposed to be on a damn vacation . The Inspector was n't long . I slid over into the rider 's seat , feeling its heat through my thin pants , to let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . Pekouris talked about the results of his search . He seemed willing enough to talk about it . They had found nothing of any importance . They had found the murder site , or at least the place where the head had been cut off . It was interestingthat it was right out in the open , only ioo yards from the Construction , in plain view . They had not found the head , or any weapons , or any other articles of evidence.  | " The men are continuing , " he said like some dictator . " But they are not likely to find the head , now . He is not likely to bury the head nearby , if he meant to bury it . " " No , " I said . " It could be anywhere within two miles . To my thought he had to come down that grassy draw with the body . " " What interests me is why cut the head off at all , " I said . " To his left was the Construction . On his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only other route was to go clear around by the hilltop . A walk of nearly one mile , past half a dozen houses on that little road . Yet we found no traces of blood in the grass down the draw . " He was nit-picking . " Was the grass pressed down , as if someone had walked over it ? " I said . " That grass is too short for that kind of an effect , " Pekourissaid . " I too find it interesting why the head was cut off at all , " he said suddenly . " I also find it very interesting that it took place so close to the ' ippie community . " My comment had finally dawned on him . But by the time it did it became his idea , and he took the credit . That was fine by me . He let me off where the main road crossed at the back of the Port . " You are going to call Mr. Kronitis ? The P.T.T. is right over there . " I nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove off , I walked the long block past the sere , thirsty " park " and past the telephone office , to the cafe terrace over the tiny produce harbor . He could have my idea . But I was n't ready to call Kronitis yet , until I wanted to . It was not yet 1o:oo A.M. I got a Paris Herald and sat at my same table and ordered a Campari-soda . I noticed a lot of the hippies around looking at me . Nobodyhad seen me get off the jeep . Apparently the news of the search had passed along like a message on the jungle telegraph , and me with it.  |p166I  also noticed that Sweet Marie was sitting at a table by herself , with her own Paris Herald . I went over . " Getting the latest scoop from the capitals of Europe ? How 's the war going ? " " War 's going badly . As usual . The Paris talks are stalled again . Some Prince from someplace is marrying some Princess , " Marie said brightly . Then she smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I sit down ? " " Oh , please . Excuse me not asking you . Nobody ever does , around here . " " I slid into a tin chair . She folded up her paper . " You 're not going out spearfishing today ? " I said . " I have n't thought about it . I 'm feeling pretty chipper today . Maybe it 's a no-therapy day . " " When I saw you sitting here , " I said , " it occurred to me we might go out today together . I bought some stuff . " " Oh , gee ! That would be great . " " I do n't have a wet suit , " I said . " So I could n't stay in that water all day . But we could take my boat somewhere . " " All right ! Fine ! " She always seemed to talk in exclamationpoints , like a teen-ager . It made me think of my own two teen-agers . But they were seventeen and thirteen . " I 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ? Where ? " " Well , I have a phone call to make . And probably something to do . But I should be finished by 12:30 . Let 's say we 'll meet at Dmitri 's at 12:30 , and I 'll bring along some sandwiches for a picnic lunch . " " Gee ! Great ! " I sat and looked at her a moment , watching her smile . " You did n't hear about the murder ? " Her face got long . " Yes . I did . Is n't it gruesome ? Who would want to do that to poor Girgis ? " " That 's what nobody seems to know , " I said.  | " It 's so sad , " Marie said . " The kids have been talking about it . " She did n't seem very upset . And she did n't seem worried . " Wo n't you be out of a job , now ? " " I suppose I can do the same job for Jim . Jim 'll take over the hash business I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girgis ? " I asked . She answered me slowly , her face clouding . " I suppose there was . Jim felt he was n't getting enough of the take . But he would n't kill Girgis , would he ? Would n't he be the first one they 'd suspect ? " " I suppose , " I said . " I never thought of it like that . " I was careful not to grin . " Well . It does n't matter , " I said . " It 's not my case . I 'll see you at 12:30 . " " Okay ! But let 's not talk about this murder business . Please ? " I shook my head no . It was funny how your instinct just told you naturally that some people were innocent . It would never have occurred to me to connect her with it . " To tell the truth , the reason I did n't go out today was because I thought it might look unseemly.  --  ?  --  " She looked up at me questioningly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , then walked back up to the P.T.T. telephone office . I placed my call to Kronitis . The government clerk was a typical mangylooking , officious little squirt with one wall eye . Exotropia , divergent strabismus . It took him a little while to get it through . When he did , he ordered me to Booth #z like a South American general . Being handicapped did not make him any kinder . Instead of Kronitis , I got an uppity male secretary who spoke with an English accent . He told me the great man could see me at 3:30 . A car would be waiting for me at the Glauros ferry dock . I disliked him instantly and blazingly . " I ca n't come at 3:30 , " I said bluntly . " I 've got something else to do . I can come now . "  | " I 'm afraid , Mr. Davies , it 's 3:30 or nothing , " he drawled . " Then it 's nothing , " I said . " Goodbye . " " Wait , wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back , he said now would be all right . But he sounded like he did n't like it . He sounded as if I had deeply shocked him . When would I be at the ferry ? " In about twenty minutes , " I said , and hung up with no goodbye . The little clerk was waiting for me to make sure I paid . When I got back to Georgina 's , the first thing I noticed was that the Agoraphobe was back , at its regular mooring . Then when I got to Dmitri 's , Jim Kirk was sitting at a table over the water . And with him was Jane Duval . Farther ahead at the boat dock Sonny was on the Daisy Mae . When he saw me , he jumped on shore and waved for me to come . " Okay , " I called . But I stopped in front of Kirk . " Hello . I see you 're back . " " My , my . Heavens to Betsy , " he rumbled . " If it ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him , who had not even acknowledgedmy presence , jerked herself away suddenly in her tin chair so that the back of her right shoulder was to me . Then , as if deliberately to bug me , though I did n't know why she thought it should , she reached out her hand across the tin table and put it over Kirk 's big paw . It less than half covered it . " You get them all straightened out back at the police post ? " I said to her . Jane tossed her head , and her long hair with it . But she did n't speak . " I guess you 've heard the bad news , " I said to Kirk . " I 've not heard anything but . Since I got back this morning . It 's all too sad , and too weird . I 'm just sorry I was n't here . If I had been , he would probably have beenp169with me . And I could have helped him . " It was a pretty long speech , for Kirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoed . " Well , if I was with him , probably nobody would have jumped him . " " You got any ideas about who did it ? " I asked . " No , " Kirk rumbled . " But I 'm sure , " he said , and looked blandly at Jane , like a cream-eating cat , " I 'm sure it would n't have been any of those nice young hippie peopleup there on the hill . It 's too bad it had to happen there . " " Inspector Pekouris seems to think it 's too bad , too , " I said . " Ah , " Kirk said , " I heard the Inspector was over here . Well , I wish him luck . " This kind of a conversation could go on forever . Besides , Sonny had come up to us from the boat , and was standing just beside me . I had to admit it made me edgy , bugged me a little , to see his wife sitting there with her hand on Kirk 's paw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to notice it . Or , if he did , did n't seem to care . " Come on , " I said gruffly . " I have to run over to Glauros . I 'll be about half an hour , or an hour . Then we 'll come back , and I 'll want the boat for this afternoon . " On the boat Sonny started his motor and I cast off so he could back us out . At the table Kirk and Jane Duval had stood up . Both of them stood waving . " Goodbye ! Goodbye ! " Kirk bellowed across the water . " We 'll see you later ! We 'll see you later ! " Both of them got on a tiny motorcycle , that was apparentlyKirk 's , and that he apparently kept at Dimitri 's tavernafor transportation ashore , and went rocketing and sputtering off along the seawall road toward the Port . The little cycle seemed to disappear beneath Kirk 's bulk alone , even without Jane hanging onto his waist behind him . By this time Sonny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we were heading out of the harbor straight across toward the mainland . " Can you tell me about what time we 'll be coming back ? " Sonny asked as we passed the little lighthouse . " I told you , " I said . " In about an hour . I think . But I ca n't be sure . " The irritability in my voice startled even me . " I wanted to know because I want to go back up to the Construction this afternoon , " he said . " Jane wants to go , to be with some of her friends . I should go with her . " I got hold of my irritation . " Well , I told you I wanted the boat for this afternoon , Sonny . Anyway , it looks like Jane wo n't be back in time to go up to the Construction with you . " I guess it was cruel , but I could n't help it . He looked so damned understanding . Sonny 's face stiffened a little , under that ridiculous Elliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider taking it out yourself again ? " After asking Marie to go out , the idea had already occurred to me . But I had n't felt I ought to ask for it a second time . " Yes , " I said . " All right . I 'll take her myself . I want to take Sweet Marie out diving . " Sonny just nodded . After a moment he said , " I guess you think I did wrong , letting Jane go off with Jim Kirk like that . " " Wrong ? What 's wrong ? Anyway , it 's not any of my affair , " I said . " It 's your woman . " " You do n't understand Jane , " he said . He looked off across the water for a long moment , then looked back . " You do n't any of you guys understand Jane . Jane 's a free spirit . All of you guys think she 's just some neurotic girl with a  --  with an itchy box . I would n't ever want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the most beautiful part of her . " " Being a free spirit always seems to entail ignoring responsibilities , " I said shortly . " Was it you who changed the baby 's diapers all the time ? "  | " Jane does n't ignore responsibilities , she just feels she has certain rights as a free individual . She wants her rights . And she has a right to them . " " Well , good for her , " I said . " As a free individual myself , I ca n't refuse to let her be one . " He looked off across the water again , " It 's you guys who ca n't appreciate her , or understand her . " Sonny cleared his throat . " About this morning . " " Never mind about this morning , " I said . " It bores me and I do n't want to talk about it . " " But there 's no reason for me and you to be at swords ' points over that . " I thought this over . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . " I did n't think I was at swords ' points with you over this morning , " I said carefully . " If I gave you the impression that this morning hurt my feelings , I did n't mean to . I apologize . " " But you still do n't understand about Jane . " Abruptly , I was furious . I got up . I was a good bit shorter than he was , but probably stronger . It did n't even matter . I poked a forefinger into his chest . " Listen , do n't tell me what I understand . I probably understandmore about hippies ' and the young than youdo . Or ever will . Christ , do n't you know I live in New York ? What do you think I do with my time ? You think I 'm not down in the East Village ? Listen , I 'm down in the East Villagemore than half my time . Doing what ? Hunting missing kids . Hunting missing kids is my major source of income , nowdays . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two daughters in their ritzy schools . Parents come to me from as far as California . Find my kid . I find them . They pay me . I talk the kids into going home . And you know what it is ? Every time ? Hurt pride ; hurt vanity . I 'm grateful for hippies . Every time I sit down to eat a meal . Do n't tell me I do n't understand hippies . I 'm a specialist . And you know what I think ? I think they 're all goddamned babies . They'rep172running away from growing up . They 're terrified of growingup . " Whatever they happen to feel , they want to gratify it now . Nobody ever taught them any self-discipline . That 's your Jane . " I stopped . I was more surprised by my outburst , apparently , than Sonny was . I turned away , and sat back down . " But , " Sonny began . And I jumped up again . Again , the forefinger . But this time I made my voice much harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You try to understand that . Somebody has killed a man . That supersedes everything . You talk about human rights . The first human right is to not be murdered . " I made my voice get even slower . " Murder changes everything . It 's got its own alchemy . I 've worked on a few murdercases . After a murder , nothing is the same . No peace , no real fun for anybody . From now on , everybody is suspect . You are . Jane is . And your friends Steve and Diane . That guy Pete . Sweet Marie . Kirk . Every man in the village , and every hippie up on that hill . That 's what murder does . " " There 's no reason that it should , " Sonny said . " No ? But it does . Is that some more of your humanism ? But that 's what murder does . Maybe you 'll need to have your life saved someday . That 's what the murderer has done to all of you . You 're suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " " What about Chantal von Anders ? " There was a subtle change in his voice . " Her , too , " I said . " Everybody . " " What about outsiders , who might have come in ? " Sonny said . " Them , too , " I said , trying to unheat myself , and looking at the Glauros shore . " Everybody is , as far as I 'm concerned . And that 's no way to have to live . Believe me . A murder is an affront to everybody . I 'm glad I 'm out of it . "  | " Well , I wish you 'd try to understand that Jane 's a believer . She believes . " " That 's great , " I said sourly . " So were the Spanish Catholicsbelievers in the days of the auto-da-fe . Give me a cynic any time . My life 's safer with him . " " I 'm sorry you wo n't try and understand us . I was hoping we could become good friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , apparently . That was all he 'd gotten out of what I 'd said . Or tried to say . Good friends . Or not good friends . I stood looking at him , and I could feel the corner of my mouth twitch , with irritation , with anger , finally with disgust . I turned away and went and sat down on the coachroof . " You 're too old to be a hippie , " I called . " No , I 'm not . Nobody 's ever too old for anything , to be anything . If they 've got the courage .  --  Here we are ! " he called . " We 're coming in ! "  |p174The  Glauros ferry dock was a rough-poured concrete ramp down into the water . I never ceased to be amazed at how badly the Greeks and the French handled concrete . The ferry itself , a U. S. Army surplus LCT painted blue and white , rocked at its dock with its ramp down . Beside this was a normal dock for caiques . We tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were parked , the biggest , blackest Rolls-Royce limousine I 'd ever seen sat solidly like a tank . The taxi drivers , a sinister-looking lot with sideburnsand dark glasses , stood around it . When we walked up the little grade , a liveried chauffeur came forward from beside it . I immediately noticed the extra weight he carried under his left arm . It looked like a lot of weight . A .357 Magnum , maybe . " Mr. Davies ? " I nodded , and he opened the door of the limousine for me . Behind me Sonny Duval whistled , a long-drawn-out nasty comment . At the door , I stuck out my jaw at him . " Just because I have to dress cheap , you think I have n't got rich friends , hunh ? " I got in . Through the tinted window glass , I got some glimpses of the town of Glauros as we went past it , not through it , up the hill . Glauros was n't big enough to go through . On top we hit the main road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacktopped , very hole-filled cowpath . The town below resembled nothing so much as a jerry-built Western town in the Arizona desert country , except for onep175thing : a big horribly modern glass-and-green-marble tourist hotel , which crouched at the near end of it . There was a row of bars nobody with 50 cents in his pocket would want to go in , a nineteenth-century brick town hall , and little else . It seemed little more than a way station for the ferry to the islands nearby . I tapped on the glass between me and the chauffeur . The chauffeur opened it . " That 's Glauros ? " " Yes , sir . " He had an upper-class English accent , too . " What do they do there ? " " Very little , sir . " " Then why the hot-shot hotel ? " " People come down from Athens , sir . " He shrugged . " And there are tourists . " " To do what ? " " There are a number of ruins in the neighborhood , sir . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire area ? Four . Perhaps five , sir . There are two fairly close by . " " That 's all ? " " There is a casino at Petkos , sir . " " I see . You 're English ? " " Yes , sir . " " Tell me , why do you carry a gun ? " " Orders , sir , " the chauffeur said promptly . " The country is quite wild hereabouts . " " Thanks , " I said . " It 's nice to know one is in good hands . " " Will that be all , sir ? " " Yes . " " Thank you , sir . " He closed the glass . He certainly had nice manners . With that cannon he was carrying , I was glad . And he could always be telling the truth . We had been driving mainly uphill , and had reached a plain . From it you could see down to the sea all around . The sea disappeared as the car moved inland . The chauf/feur made some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a sea vista opened up , in the center of which was a breath-taking villa . It had everything . It had its own electric plant . It had a king-sized swimming pool . It might even have had its own fresh water plant , to turn sea water into fresh . It was that elaborate . As we got down closer to it , the place looked more and more like an armed fortress . There was a big iron grill gate , chained , with a gateman . There was a whitewashed high wall , with dangerouslooking glass cemented on top . I leaned forward and tapped the glass . The chauffeur opened it . " Tell me , is that the casino ? " There was the tiniest pause , then the modulated voice , " No , sir . That is Mr. Kronitis 's estate . " " That 's where we 're going ? " " Yes , sir . " " I forgot to bring my bathing suit . " Again the tiny pause , before the voice , " I 'm sure there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I guess he thought me irreverent . I felt irreverent . This time the chauffeur did n't close the glass . Ahead of us the gateman recognized us and had the gate open before we rolled up to it . He touched his cap like a well-bred peasantas we went through . " You 've got well-bred peasants here , " I said . " Yes , sir . " My ire was still rising , as the chauffeur turned me over to a butler . It was enough to almost make you a Communist . The ire went up further , as the butler led me through an elaborate living area , out beside the big delicious marble pool , and into an annex and turned me over to the male secretaryI had spoken to earlier . He did n't say a word to me , except a polite , " Mr. Davies . " It was a good thing for him he did n't . He escorted me from his own small office into a huge one . Far across it , beside windows that looked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat behind a desk the size of a small hockey rink . With an effort , I waded across the thick-napped carpet . Kronitis got up , smiling . " Please sit down , Mr. Davies . Why are you walking so strangely ? " " I always do that when I ca n't see my ankles , " I said . " Then , too , I was scared of maybe tripping over a small log that might have been mislaid down in there . " Kronitis stared at me puzzled , still smiling . " Oh . Yes . One of your jokes . Freddy Tarkoff told me about your jokes . " He indicated a chair before the desk , one of several white leather ones scattered about the room . " Please sit . " " Well , hardly a joke . Carpets that thick frighten me , " I said . " Are you sure I wo n't get this dirty ? " I looked at the chair . " If all this has been done to impress me , I 'm im-pressed . " Kronitis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a polite , but rather mirthlesslaugh . " Freddy Tarkoff has told me all about you , Mr. Davies . But I had rather expected we would meet in anothersituation , under different circumstances . " He was a very dry man . Sec , the French would say . He probably spoke perfect French . " You mean like at Ambassador Pierson 's for dinner . " " Something like that , yes . " " I prefer the ruder , more exotic fisherman 's hovel . What do you want to see me about , Mr. Kronitis ? " I had sat down . Now I deliberately placed one dusty bare sandaled foot on the other knee . " I want to hire you , Mr. Davies . I want to employ your services to find out who killed , who murdered , my man GirgisStourkos . I 'm prepared to pay you handsomely . " He opened a desk drawer . " Hold on . It 's not that easy , Mr. Kronitis , " I said . " I do n't usually take jobs I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you do n't know anything about me . Kronitis remained poised , hand still in desk drawer . " I know all I need to know about you from Freddy Tarkoff . " " He never mentioned you to me , " I said . " No reason that he should . But I 'm prepared to tell you everything about me you want to know . Certain highfinancearrangements of mine , of course , I ca n't talk about . " I grinned . " No . I would n't expect that . " I remembered who he made me think of . It was an aged mathematics professorI had at Denver . " But anything else . " " I would n't even know where to start . You own the Polaris , Girgis 's boat , do n't you , Mr. Kronitis ? " " That 's correct . Or , rather , I own most of it . I gave Girgis Stourkos 20 percent of it as an inducement . " I had been wrong about one thing , anyway . The old man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perchance know that Girgis was runninga very profitable illegal hashish-smuggling operation from the Polaris ? And if so , would you be owning 8o percent of that ? " Kronitis 's face had become very still . He looked genuinelysurprised . " No , sir , I would n't . The answer is no to both questions . I had no idea of that . " He was surprised , all right . " It seems to be the truth , " I said . " Would that affect your wanting to hire me ? " " No , it would n't . Not in the least . " " Not even if the smuggling became public ? " Kronitis thought a moment . His hand was still poised in the drawer . " No . No , it would n't bother me . I had nothing to do with it , and know nothing about it . I 'm genuinely shocked . And I still want whoever killed him caught and punished . " I nodded . " Fine . "  | " Well , he worked for me , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer . " I try to look after people who work for me , Mr. Davies . " I suddenly decided not to mention Kirk to him . The old gent seemed straight enough . Certainly his surprise about the hashish was straight . And I did n't want to lose Kirk his job . Certainly not if he was innocent . And especially not , if he was guilty . Not yet . Kronitis pulled out a nice sheaf of new $loo bills . " I have four thousand dollars here , Mr. Davies . In cash . Which I 'm prepared to give you this morning as a retainer . " He spread the bills in a row on the desk in front of me . They looked mighty good , and mighty genuine . And Kronitis knew it . I pursed my lips in a soundless whistle for him . " That 's a lot of money to me , Mr. Kronitis . That 's more than I get for two missing kid jobs in New York . " " You would charge your usual fee and expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer , he murmured , " I suppose it was all those hippies up there on the hill . He just could n't resist the temptation . " " Yes , sir . It would seem so . Well , what would you say if I told you that the prime suspects in the murder case so far are also people who work for you ? " At this Kronitis 's eyebrows went up . He still had his hand poised among the $loo bills , carefully squaring them in line , like my mathematics professor used to do his books . " I 'm referring , " I said , " to two of those same hippies . An American boy named Steve , and his sidekick called Chuck . Would you still want to hire me ? " Kronitis stared at me fixedly , a stormy look . He sat back . " Some kind of gang killing , then ? About who owns the hashish rights ? " " Something like that . " " You 're also referring , Mr. Davies , I imagine , to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir , I would still want to hire you . "  | " Well , would you mind telling me why you financed that night club , and how much of it you own ? " " I own all of it . That 's required by Greek law . But we split the profits of it 50-5o . That was my deal with Steve . I thought it would not be wise to favor him too much , and give him all the profits . As to why I did it , this boy Steve came to me about it . I thought it would be better if I financed it , than if some unsavory outside element came in from Athens . " You may not know it , Mr. Davies , but Tsatsos is a vanishingtype among the Greek islands . It has kept to the old ways , and so far it has n't been exploited . Mostly that is because it was a resort for Athenian Greeks long before the Americans and Europeans started touristing our country in large numbers . Some of us hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place it 's always been . " Naturally , any outside unscrupulous money from Athens getting an opening foothold through a night club , would begin to jeopardize that . Yet there was a natural need for such a night club . I thought backing this boy Steve would take care of it . Also , he seemed to be able to control the hippiecolony fairly well . " That sounded square enough to me . " Do you have any idea why this hippie colony has been tolerated as long as it has , Mr. Kronitis ? " " No , I do n't . The Greek government has its own reasons for doing what it does . These are ticklish times , Mr. Davies . Almost certainly the present government will not last forever . I am not privy to the government 's thinking . But I would imagine the money brought in by the hippies is a consideration . They are n't poor . " " That sounds fair enough , " I said . I paused . " If I take your money , and your job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in bad taste  --  the heads will have to fall where they may . " Kronitis wrinkled his nose . A fastidious man , clearly.  |p181Well  , he could afford it . " I would not expect anything different . That 's the very reason I want to hire you , Davies , " he said just the same . He reached out and shuffled the bills together . " Here . " " One minute . I 've got another question . Would you happen to know anything about why three men , from off the island as far as I can find , would come to Tsatsos wanting to work me over ? " " Work you over ? " " Beat me up . " " Is that what happened to your face ? " " Yes . But I thought it did n't show any more . " " Just a little . A little bruise . Under the skin . So they beat you up ? " " They tried . They did n't succeed . But why , I do n't know . Maybe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out . My old math professor had a big jaw too , when he wanted to use it . Above the jaw Kronitis grinned . " I would think that would be precisely the way to guarantee that you stayed , Mr. Davies . " " As a matter of fact , it would . But you would n't know anything about it ? " " No , sir . I would not . " " Okay . My fees are a hundred and fifty a day and expenses . " I got up . " I 'll take your money , Mr. Kronitis . " I put the money in my wallet and got one of my cards out of it . " I 'll write you a receipt on this . " The money felt nice and thick . I passed the receipt across the desk . " Why do n't you trust the local police ? To get the guy . " " I trust them . I am acquainted with Inspector Pekouris for a long time . I would also like to know a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you mind if I told them you 've hired me ? " Kronitis was silent a moment . " I would rather they did not know . If there is a choice . "  | " I 'm afraid I 'll have to tell them . " " All right . Tell them , then . " I straightened up . I took my time putting my fat wallet away . Then I said , softly , " Mr. Kronitis , if I found there was anything fishy about the reason you hired me , I 'd drop the case like a hot rock . And you would n't get your retainer back . " " That 's fine , " Kronitis stood , and put out his hand , " perfectlyfine . I find you are everything Freddy Tarkoff said you were . " " If he told you that for my fee I give good service to honest clients , he 'd be right , too , " I said . I took the hand . It was as sec as the rest of him . " Goodbye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long plod back across that carpet . His head was already bent over his desk as I shut the door softly behind me . Outside , the man secretary looked at me questioningly , but I stared him down with a blank face . Then the same routine to get me back out of there began all over again just the same , this time in reverse . The secretaryhanded me off to the butler . The butler carted me out through that establishment . I went through my momentaryCommunist proclivities again . The butler passed me to the chauffeur . The chauffeur lateraled me into his Rolls . I was a football . Or a baseball , in the old double-play routine : Tinker to Evers to Chance . Back at Glauros I stopped the chauffeur at the end of the main drag , before we rolled out onto the dock . Pekouris had said he was going back to his office . After the chauffeur opened and closed the door for me , still wearing his big piece of iron , he touched his cap . I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment snapped him back a tight little half-military Army salute . I supposed it was all right if a very rich man wanted his English chauf/feur to sport a .357 cannon . Especially down here in the wilds of the lower Greek finger peninsulas . My salute did n't faze him a bit . I started on into the tiny town , toward the nineteenthcenturytown hall of brick.  |p184The  whole place was deserted , except for a few bored touristson the veranda of the ugly marble hotel . For a split seconddown in the dirt street I felt like Wyatt Earp walking down the dusty main drag of Tombstone looking for a showdown with somebody . Behind me , Sonny Duval came galloping up , and fell into step . " Where are you going ? I 'll go with you . " I stopped in the rutted street . " No , you wo n't . I 've got an errand to do . I want to do it by myself . " " Well , gee , " Sonny said . He was putting on a fake boyishness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Okay , boss . Yes , sir , boss . " He turned back toward the dock . I looked after him grimly . Sometimes he could try even my superb patience . I went on to the city hall . Inside , it was dirty , unswept , empty . It looked and smelled about like any county courthouseI 'd ever been in in the United States . Rolls of dirt that my mother used to call slut feathers lay in the corners of the marble floor . Its dimness gave a false impression of cool in the heat . A sign pointed to the Police Inspector 's office . I knocked , and went in . Inside Pekouris was at a desk , and one other man sat at a live , but silent radio apparatus . Pekouris had taken off his suit coat but not his tie , and sat in his short-sleeved white shirt . " Well , Mr. Davies , " he said with his brutal smile , and half closed Turkish eyes . " So soon ? Have you solved our murder for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the other man.  | " Him ? " Pekouris said . " He does n't count . " " Yes , he does . " He said something in Greek and the man went out . " He does n't speak English , anyway . " He pushed back his chair . " Sit down , Mr. Davies . Here you see my tiny , unelegant , unexpensive little domain . It is not as nice as Mr. Kronitis 's place , is it ? " So he already knew I 'd been there . Well , the Rolls was easy to spot in Glauros . I said , " I hear you spend most of your time away from it . " " It is true I am in Athens a lot . On business . But I will not be now , for a while , I think , huh ? " " I just stopped by for a minute . Kronitis has hired me to investigate the murder . Wants me to find the killer . I told him I would have to tell you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He just nodded . It was almost as if he had known it all beforehand . " Well , we are glad to have you working with us . I 'm sure it will all be amicable . " He gave me a big phony smile . " However , murders are police cases , Mr. Davies . We do not enjoy to have private detectives from America coming in and messing things up , and then stealing all the publicity and glory for solving a murder . " That was more like what I expected to hear . I had begun to wonder if he was ever going to say it . I had my answer already prepared . " I can understand that . That 's why I 'm here to see you . I 'm not after any glory . And anything I find out will be put at your disposal at once . I 'll only be assisting . " " I suppose I could not stop you nosing around anyway . Even if you were not hired . You are like the old huntingdog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was almost suspicious . " But I want to caution you . Do not talk about the case . Play it down , as you would say . Away down . That is of major importance to us right now . "  | " Do you think I would go around talking about it ? " " No . Not deliberately . But your investigations may call attention to it . I do n't want that now . I have been on the telephone with Athens , and I have a clear directive from them : Solve it , but solve it fast . Whatever I do , hush it up . We have our main tourist season coming up right away now . " I 'll be careful , " I said . " It is much more than to just be careful . It is a policy . " He waved his hand . " As far as I am concerned , it is already almostwhat you Americans call a case of the open-and-shut , anyhow . " He pushed around among the papers on his desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club , and his crazy friend , are the guilty party . All that remains is to find the proof . " " Well , " I said slowly . " That 's certainly a possibility . But I would n't call it a certainty yet . " " Well , it is , " Pekouris said firmly . " For me . " He found the paper he was looking for . " Did you know that this boy Chuck , the one with the thick glasses , was wanted in Mexico , not too long ago , for chopping some poor Mexican up and nearly killing him with a machete ? " I pretended to do a slow take . It was n't all pretense . " No , I did n't . How did you find that out ? " " Oh , I have my ways , Mr. Davies . I have my ways of findingout all sorts of things . " The superior , dictatorial smile . " It is true . " He handed me the paper in his hand . It was a cablegramfrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read the text . It said pretty much what he had told me . I noted it was dated six weeks before the date of the murder . " Well , that puts a different weight in the scales , does n't it ? " I said , handing it back . " We always have our passport check , you know , Mr. Davies , " Pekouris said . " Upon entry . We can keep pretty close tabs on things . " Pekouris sighed elaborately . " Yes , it does put a lot of weight on the scale , as you say . It was you whop187suggested we look for why cut off the head at all . What better why than a man who has a machete and is used to using it . Of course , we still must find the proofs . " " Yes , " I said . " That 's important , too . " " Do you know anything about those two ? " Pekouris said suddenly . " Have you ever talked to them ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Georgina Taylor 's . A couple of times on the town terrace . " Pekouris nodded . We both knew he knew the answer to his question before he asked it . " Did they say anything interesting ? " " They sure did , " I said . " They threatened him . Not in any specific way . I mean , no threat of killing . But they threatenedhim . " " As if maybe they did not like the way he ran his hashish business , and were perhaps thinking of taking it over and running it better ? " Pekouris said . " That was it . " " There , you see ? We have our motive . " " Yes , " I said . " We sure do . But , as you said , it is n't proved yet . Pekouris shrugged . " Have you picked them up ? " " I 'm not ready for that yet . " He smiled that scary smile , " They wo n't go away . " From the door I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm working for anyone . " He looked up at me , then nodded his understanding . " I suggest you do n't , Davies . " I did n't like that so much . That was n't exactly the way I had meant it . What was he telling me ? Take my money and shut up and do n't make waves ? Be glad I had Mr. K. 's dough and keep out of the way ? It sounded like it . But if I ever suggested to him that that was what he meant , he would be perfectly within his rights to deny it . And he would believe himself implicitly , when he did.  |p188Those  kids had about as much chance going up against Pekouris as I had getting in the same ring with a cobra . Against him and me , they were like three-year-old babies swimming in the same tank with two old ocean-going white sharks . If they were guilty God or somebody had better help them . I was inclined to go along with his theory , at least for now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was going to take a lot more proof than we had so far , just to convince me . I walked out of the dim , dusty-smelling , dirty-floored town hall into the Greek sun.  |p189I  had plenty to put me into a think-fog on the way back . But I did n't feel much different . I had a fatter wallet , was all . I was still the same guy . Sonny was over his sulks , and left me alone . The boat ride was as delicious as ever . The weather was still that magnificentweather , the scenery the same beautiful scenery . The sparkling sea , the bright baking sun , the fresh sea breeze cutting the heat , the green island in front of us and the dun coast behind , the bright dots of chapels on the hills , the scrubbed clean white of the town : the cerulean mask archingover it all an enormous sky , so remote and so tranquil and not caring a damn . Down below all us little worms scrabbling and scrawling away . Sometimes you felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Dmitri 's dock Kirk and Jane Duval had not come back yet and the tiny motorcycle was not there . Sweet Marie had not shown up either . " Well , I 'll leave the Daisy Mae with you here , " Sonny said . " I 'll wait on Jane . " " Where 's the baby ? " I said . " We left her up at the Construction , with one of Jane 's friends . We 're to pick her up this afternoon . " The place was beginning to fill up out by the water with people for pre-luncheon drinks . Every time a new motorbike or cycle came up Sonny looked hopefully down the seawall road . " Come on , Sonny . I 'll buy you a drink , " I said , feeling sorryp190for him . " But only if you promise not to talk any of your damned hippie philosophy to me . " When we had ordered , Sonny said , " What were you doing over there this morning ? Whose limousine was that ? " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more than glad to tell you whose limousine it was , " I said . " So I wo n't spoil your fun in finding out , by telling you now all at once . " Before it could get any further , somebody called to me from the roofed-over patio room that was a part of the building . It was the bearded Pete Gruner , the cop , or ex-cop , or non-cop , in a brocaded embroidered Turkoman jacket that must have cost $500 . " Hey , Lobo ! Hey , Davies ! You think you got a little time to talk , now ? " I started to refuse . Then I reminded myself I was working now . No source could afford to be neglected . " Excuse me , " I said to Sonny . " I 'll be right back . " I went over and between the pillars and into the open room to his table . Except for us the room was empty . " I 'm particular about who calls me by my first name . If you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . He ordered drinks for both of us . Then he started right in on me . " What 's on your mind , Gruner ? " I said . " Nothing much . But I 'm wondering what 's on yours ? " I felt blunt . " About what ? " I said rudely . " Well , just for example , this killing . I 'd like very much to know what you think about it . And I 'd like to know how it affects the thinking of whoever sent you down here , to do whatever it was they sent you down here to do . " I took what I pretended was a deep angry breath , then pretended I was letting it out slowly to keep my temper . " Look , Gruner . I 'm down here on vacation . I already told you that . I do n't really give a damn about this killing . " " Yeah , sure , " he said mockingly . " That 's the fact . I did a little investigations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He liked what I did so much , he offered me a month 's paid vacation down here . Otherwise I could n't even afford it . Now , go and put that in your report . " " What report ? " " Whatever report it is you 're writing for whatever Departmentit is you work for . " " Oh . You 're still pretending you think I 'm a cop . " " You stink cop a mile away . I 'd bet my bottom dollar on it . I do n't know how you ever managed to fool these people . What did you pay for that jacket you 're wearing ? It must have cost $500. " " $350 , " he grinned . " In Athens . " " In Athens . If they had them in Athens . It would be $500 anyplace else . " " I 'd seriously like to know what you think about this killing , " he said . " What do you make of it ? Or will you let yourselfhave an opinion ? " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " from what I know about Girgis . If you want my strictly amateur 's opinion , it 's an Athens gang killing  --  probably from off the island  --  to see what petty local Athens crook is going to handle the local hashish trade . That 's all it is . " " You think off the island ? " " I do n't see any likely suspects around here , do you ? " " I could see a lot of them . Listen , there 's a lot , " Pete said darkly , and looked around , " a lot going on around here that your simple-minded theory do n't exactly explain . " " You said that before . Like what ? " He would only make an irritated , dark gesture . " See , I think Girgis did n't work alone . Okay , what about this funny little guy , that was Girgis 's assistant on the boat ? " " What about him ? I never even noticed him . " " Well , notice him . What 's he going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polaris ? The Polaris is owned by some rich guy , named Kroanis , or Kronitis . Does he know what racket Girgis was working ? Was Girgis working it on his own ? Will thisp192rich guy de-commission the boat now ? Or will he let that ugly little mate of Girgis 's go on running it ? " " I have n't the slightest idea , " I said . " This guy Kirk , on this yacht Agoraphobe , owned by this same Kroanis , has been Girgis 's supplier for the hashish . Does Kroanis know about that ? But Kirk ca n't leave the Agoraphobe to take over Girgis 's retail trade . He 's not here enough . " " You do n't really know his name is Kronitis ? " I said . " Sure , I know .  --  ?  --  " He looked at me . " So ? " I said . " See , I think I could get that job of Girgis 's , " Gruner said . " Why not ? That little assistant clearly ca n't handle it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that . " Are you sure you want to do that ? " I said . We were talking now as if he were a cop . We were talking like two cops together . He had never admitted it , but we were tacitly , without acknowledging it , talking as if he had . " Why not ? " Pete grinned . " There 's a lot of dough to be made , there . And a lot to be learned . " " That might be one way to explain an awful lot of things . " " Sure . " " And you could suddenly find yourself with no head , like Girgis . " " I do n't think so . I 'm warned already , by him . " I thought it was time to stop it . " Anh , you government people are always looking for some cops-and-robbers game to play , " I said . He looked at me . " Damn it , do n't say that . I 'm a damned dropout , that 's what I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indecent  --  living . And I could use some of that money . " " Do you people get to keep all the illicit loot you pick up on the way , or do you have to turn it in ? " I said . " I 've always wondered about that . "  | " Lay off of me , Davies . I told you I 'm not a cop . " " Whatever you say , Gruner , whatever you say , " I said . " Well , do n't count on me for anything . One way or theother , " I added . " I 'm not playing . " Pete stared at me and grinned slowly . " I wish I could be sure of that , " he said , obscurely . " There 's some big stuff mucking around , around here . It would be a shame if we were bucking heads on it . " He got up suddenly , and threw money on the table . " See you around . " He turned and walked off out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't learned very much . What was all this Big Stuff he was talking about . He had to be a nark . And if he was a nark he had to be after heroin . It did n't fit in with anything I knew . I got up and went back to Sonny . Sonny was still sitting and nursing his drink . I sat down . All the ice in mine had melted in the hot sun . I drank it anyway . Before I could get the glass away from my mouth , I heard a motorcycle coming and sensed Sonny in front of me jumpingup . I put my glass down slowly and slowly swung around in my tin chair . It was them , all right . I did n't get up . Jane hopped off and Kirk parked the tiny cycle in its place against the taverna wall . When Jane turned around , I saw that she had grass stems on the back of her brocaded Mother Hubbard and in the back of her long hippie girl hair . She was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticeable . She had n't even bothered to brush herself off . Kirk probably had n't even noticed . If he had , he would n't have cared . She probably had n't bothered to wash herself , either . I supposed she did n't bother to wear panties . Well , what did I care . I had always liked girls who did n't wear panties . I still did n't get up . " Well , Sonny , " Kirk rumbled in a magnanimous tone . " You 're back . And here 's your lady , back all safe and sound . "  |p194He  made a sweeping gesture of passing her over , then walked over to me . " Well , it 's old Lobo Davies . Have a good boat trip , Lobo ? " " Tolerable , " I said . I still did n't get up . " By God , you 're as country as me . When you want to be , " Kirk grinned . " And I am pretty damn country . " He stretched and yawned , flexing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go on board and take a little nap . " He gave me a merry wink with that eyelid like a slab of red beef . " Come on , Jane , " Sonny said from behind me . " We 'll take the bikes up to the Construction . " I watched the two of them trundle their bikes out away from the taverna wall . They were parked there near Kirk 's tiny cycle . Sonny , with all his money , apparently had never invested in a motorcycle himself . Probably one of his phonyliberaltheories about living only off of what he made . I already knew that he did n't even do that . The two of them went riding off up the seawall road . Kirk went down and got in his skiff to row out . I moved over into the shade and ordered a fresh drink . I knew one thing . I was glad I was a private eye and not a hippie . But I was probably old-fashioned . I drank my drink and waited for Marie.  |p195She  arrived walking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lugging her faded duffel bag of diving gear . I sent her on board to stow her gear , and went in to Dmitrios to see about our picnic lunch . When I carried the sacks on board , she had changed to a bikini and was sitting on the coach-roof in the sun . She was burned a deep bronze and there was n't an excess ounce of fat on her anywhere . It gave her one of those lean , wideopennavels you sometimes see on young girls . You could see right to the bottom of it . She knew a place up the mainland coast she wanted to try . She had swum there as a guest on boats , but had never spearfishedit . Without a boat , she had no way of getting there on her own . I headed us up that way . There was a shallow reef three hundred yards offshore , she told me as I worked us out through the web of lines and boats and passed the little lighthouse . The shore had a long , white sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two low rocky points . It was completely inaccessible except by sea . The nearest road was three miles inland , and the nearest farm was a mile away . There would not be a soul there unless another boat was there . " It 's about twelve or thirteen miles , " she said suddenly after we had run a while in silence , and squirmed around so that she could sit up clasping her knees facing me . The tiny bikini pants hid just about nothing.  |p196I  just nodded . " You know what I like about you ? " Marie smiled . " It 's that I do n't feel I have to talk when I 'm with you . Most people , you have to talk every minute . With you it does n't matter , you can sit forever and it 's okay . " I did n't answer that , either . I was determined I was going to give her a great day of diving and spearfishing . One she could think back about . Why , I did n't know . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might learn from her about the case . Somewhere down in the back of that flighty little featherheadof hers , that also carried so much of her own young anguish and a kind of young desolation , there might be some little plum of information she was n't aware of . She had lapsed back into silence . I did n't talk either . Around us the summer day buzzed along , friendly , lazy , not at all inimical , making you happy by its existence , seeming to offer you free without charge or work the fruits of nature 's growth . There was a slight swell on the sea , and a light breeze that brought on it the smell of the hot land . Along our left side the dun , sere terrain of the mainland unrolled itself hill after hill . Out at sea mountainous islands reared up a dark blue in the heat haze . Time seemed to sort of go away . We passed a long low luxurious establishment with its own cove and landing dock that I recognized as Kronitis 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapel on its top that had just been renovated . The old stones had been reset and pointed , and young trees had been set out around it . A new concrete road ran up to it and circled it to rejoin itself and fade away into the dun thistle-strewn hills . It seemed to wait eternally in the sun for the tourist cars that were supposed to come . " It 's awful , is n't it ? " Marie said . I nodded . " Yes . "  |p197We  lapsed back into our silence . A couple of miles farther on Marie said , " Here it is . " There were n't any other boats . I ran us in almost to the deserted beach for a look at it . It was a great beach . It had to be at least a quarter of a mile long . And not a living thing anywhere in the baking sun except a few gulls sunning on the rocks . At one end a hill that ran back into the land had three gnarled trees on it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , " I said . " If it looks like it 'll pay enough . " I ran us out to the reef and cut the motor . I was in a **28;14716;TOOLONG mood that had taken me over . Even the future road and all the people and crud it would someday bring here did not bother me that much . My anchormade a loud splash in the sun-stillness . I caught it on the bottom , then just sat and looked down through the clear , clean water . There was n't a sound anywhere except the water moving against the boat , and the cry of a gull now and then . Behind me Marie took off her bikini and put on her wet suit . She did n't like the feel of clothing on her under the suit , she explained in a sun- and sea-dazzled voice . In the stillness I did n't feel like answering her . I was acutely aware of her moving nude behind me . Then she came over to me , metamorphosed into that long black apparitionagain . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to get in , " she said . " You ca n't stay out of the water very long in these things . " She had left the tight helmetoff . She lowered her mask and speargun in hand went over the side , feet first . I got my stuff and followed her . The chill of the water brought me out of my dazzlement immediately . I whooped around my snorkel when I came up . Below me the bottom lay at 30 or 35 feet . The reef stretched away right and left across the face of the beach . Fifty yards out it dropped down an underwater cliff another 35 feet , to a sand bottom whichp198just ran on out to sea until it faded in the haze . Marie had already swum out to the edge of it . I followed her . I could see right away that she did n't know too much . She swam and surface-dived well enough , but 30 feet was about her absolute limit . After 20 feet she began to hedge and freeze up . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I was . " Do you want me to give you a few pointers ? " I said . " Oh , please . Teach me . Everything you can . I want to learn it . " " I 'm not being too dictatorial ? " Under water to her ears , she shook her head vigorously . She had this marvelous quality of putting herself in your hands completely . A lot of people had abused it in her life , I guessed . In me , it brought out all the gentleness I had . I started showing her some of the things . Hyperventilation , and oxygenation . How to swim down slowly , not swiftly . The slower she went down the longer she could stay . Do n't rush for the surface , swim up slowly . I made her ignorethe heavings of her diaphragm . By the time we had done a dozen dives , she was going down and coming up , at 35 feet , as lazily and as gracefully as any of the old pros who had tutored me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said after the last one , treading water to put her head out . " It 's always been fun . But it 's never been like this ! This is something else . " I felt like I 'd picked up a few points for decency , with God or whoever . We swam up and down the reef in the little bay for a while , hunting grouper and diving . It was great fun , in the still , marvelous Greek sun . Finally , when I thought she was ready , I said , " Come on , I 'll give you a demonstration . " I took her hand and led her out beyond the edge of the reef over the deeper water , and handed her the stringer of fish.  |p199I  did n't know how far down I could get , but I knew I could make the 45 feet I had made the day before with Sonny . I lay on the surface and ventilated , then started down . I amazed myself by going right on down . I did n't push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until suddenly I was on it , without straining at all . I reached out and picked up a dead shell half-buried in the sand . I seemed to have all the time in the world . I rolled over and looked up and waved at Marie on the surface . The small figure way up there waved back at me . Just to make sure , I looked at my meter-calibrated depth gauge . It gave me a reading of 20.5 meters . Just about 68 feet . It was weird what you could do when you had an admiring audience to show off for . I turned over and started back up . About 20 feet up I spotted a big grouper under a ledge , waving his fins at me . I kept on going . I had that feeling I always got swimming up , of an immense regret to be leaving . I swam slower and slower . My diaphragm heaved only a couple of times . The surface came further and further down to me . Then I popped out through it and blew my snorkel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking back down at where I had been . It seemed a long way down there . As always , it was awesome . " Ohh , that was beautiful ! " Marie said beside me . " Oh , that was beautiful . You were beautiful . So graceful . You looked so free . I 'd give anything to be able to do that . " I guessed that was it . You felt so free . Free of gravity . Free of earth . And graceful . Sometimes you felt that , if only you did n't have to breathe , you could stay down forever . After I rested , I went back down after the big grouper and shot him easily . I saw four or five others , in crevices or under ledges . On the surface I added him to the stringer and began the job of getting Marie to go down with me . I knew it would be a hard job , it always was . But it proved easier than Ip200thought with Marie . The first time she failed to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free and went up . The second time a sort of just general malaise and panic at being there , being that deep , got her and she went up again . But the third time I got her down far enough to see the big groupers . Maybe 45 feet . After that , she was over the psychologicalhurdle . We had been in the water maybe two hours by then . In the next hour Marie shot four of the big groupers down under the ledge , and I added them to the stringer for her . I did n't shoot any more myself , but just went down with her . Then I thought it was time to call a halt . Marie acted as if she wanted to go on forever , but I refused to let her . Besides , the stringer was becoming a drag on my streamlining and heavy to lug around . Back at the boat I passed her up the stringer , which was a lot heavier out of the water than in , then pulled off my flippers and climbed up myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fish down , and was swiftly stripping off her wet suit . She already had the top almost off . As I stepped on deck she threw it down and started on the long-legged bottoms . She had hard , tight , dark nipples , made harder and tighter by the water chill probably . It did n't seem to bother her that she was not alone . She did n't seem to mind if I watched . But I minded . I turned my back . Perhaps because of me , she put back on her bikini pieces before she stretched out on the coach-roof in the sun , breathlessly . " Oh , wow , " she said between breaths , stretching her face up to the sun with her eyes closed . " I guess this is just about the best day in my life . I 'm glad you made us stop . I guess I would n't have quit until dark . " I decided not to answer . I got out the gin bottle and the vermouth bottle and ice . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I guess you do n't knowp201what you 've given me , Mr. Davies . You 've taught me something I 'll be able to use the whole rest of my life . " I did n't feel much like answering that . I began to swish the martini mixture in the big Mason jar . After a little bit she sat back up and I handed her a glass . I ran us in to the beach with my glass in one hand , and we ate our lunch on the boat under the tarpaulin . Then we waded ashore to lie in the sun a while . The meal had made us both drowsy . We were both ravenouslyhungry from the diving and I had bought a lot . Bread and meat and cheese and mustard and the tomato and Greek cheese salad . And it tasted great , with the bottles of red wine I had dropped over the side earlier to chill and then dove down for . We were not stretched out on the sand five minutes when Marie began taking her bikini off . She started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back , but my face was partly toward her and I could see her from the outside of my eye . " I would rather you did n't do that , " I said . She stopped , then turned her head to look at me . " Oh , but it 's all right . Do n't worry . There is n't anyone within miles . " " That was not what I meant , " I said . " Oh , " Marie said . Then , " Oh . Oh , all right . " She still had her hands up behind her , at the bra fasteners . She sort of hesitated . " The bra , too ? " " If you would n't mind , " I said . " Oh , I do n't mind , " she said . " It 's just that I 'm used to it . Nude bathing . You know ? I did n't even think . " I did n't answer . She left the bra on , and then lay back down sort of thoughtfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " If you wanted to ball me , I would n't mind . " " Well , I do n't , " I said . " And you ought to be ashamed of yourself . I 'm old enough to be your father . " " Oh , that does n't matter , " Marie said . She lay still severalp202more moments with her eyes closed . " That 's what I like about it . It 's kicky . " " That 's not the truth , " I said . " No . It 's not . The truth is I guess I just like you . Like I said the other night . " " I appreciate your offer , " I said . " But I 'm shy . " " Look , you do n't have to explain anything . You do n't want to ball me , you do n't want to ball me . " " But now I 've hurt your feelings . " " Are you kidding , Mr. Davies ? " " Tell me about the kids up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They 're just kids . " " You told me they were n't all students . " " There 're some oldies . But mostly they 're just students . College kids . Like I used to be . Kids between years at school . What is it you want to know ? They 'll almost all go back and finish school . Take a job . Get married . You 'd be surprised how many are there because their fathers made them come . A summer on the bum in Europe . But bumming on the old man 's money . " " What about these two , Chuck and Steve ? " " They 're different . And that girl Diane . They 're worse than just dropouts . They all come from decent families , I think . But they 've learned to be con artists . They con the other kids for their living . " " Are n't they the leaders up there ? " " I suppose . In a way . That 's just the trouble . Did you ever see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " I said . " I have n't . " " Sure . That 's what the trouble with the world is that we ca n't fix . Well , the kids all know that . That 's what all the fuss back home is about , really . And they know it up here at the Construction , just like they know it at home in politics . But they do n't know what to do about it . Their own leaders do them in , too . "  | " Nobody has ever found out what to do about it , " I said . " Chuck and Steve do n't seem much like leaders . " " Well , they are . They 've got the flair . The kids will listen to them and follow them . Steve 's the leader , really . Chuck is just his hatchet man . He 's even got this machete he 's always carrying around and playing with . " " Oh ? " I said . " The other day they stole a stray goat from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Chuck cut off its head with his machete . Then he went around with the blood on the machete . Would n't wipe it off . He 's got a thing about blood on his machete . " I nodded . I could n't ask her if she thought they had killed Girgis . " I do n't think they killed Girgis , " Marie said . " Chuck 's not like that . He 's just a kid . He likes to go around playing cowboys . " " Sure , " I said , " I see . " I moved my head . I was n't going to tell her how he had played cowboys in Mexico . " Tell me about yourself . How did you wind up in Tsatsos ? " " I 'd rather not talk about me , Mr. Davies . If you do n't mind . It will only upset me and depress me and put me down . And I 've had a wonderful day with you . " I came to Tsatsos with a boy I met in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Construction . We came together . He left . I stayed . " " How did you get to Paris ? " " From Haight-Ashbury , with another boy . See , I went a year to Berkeley . Then I met this boy and dropped out with him . He wanted to be a rock singer . We lived in HaightAshburyfor a while . Then he brought me to Paris . I lived with him in Paris for a year before he left me . He said I was disruptive to his art , and he was n't doing very well . I do n't know whatever happened to him . " Please , Mr. Davies . I really do n't want to talk about me . " " And your parents are both dead ? "  |p204After  a moment she said , " Yes . For a couple of years . My mother died of diabetes , my father from a heart attack . He drank too much , and she ate too much . " " Have you ever thought about going back ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . And it 's hard , when you have n't got anybody there at all to go back to . " Please , Mr. Davies ! " " Okay , " I said , " I 'm sorry . " I rolled over and heaved myself to my feet . " Come on . If we 're going to do anything more , we better get moving . " She held out her hands to me . I leaned over and pulled her up . We dove into the clear , clean water over the sand , and swam out to the boat and climbed up dripping wet . It felt marvelous , after the sun heat . " There 's still time to dive some more , " I said , looking at her in the wet bikini . I was starting to regret not accepting her offer on the beach . I did regret it . She smiled and shook the water off herself . She pulled her long hair straight back . Then she shook her head . " No . I guess not . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been perfect . " " Then we 'll head on back , then ? " I said . Now I regretted it enormously . She was really something . So young . But that was just the trouble . And now it was past and too late . I wanted to swear . " Yes . And thank you an awful lot , Mr. Davies . " I moved my head . There was n't really anything I could say to her . Or do for her . I got the anchor up , and we headed out . Ahead of us the sun had moved west just enough to begin to turn the top of Tsatsos a faint red . Where the people were . I headed for it.  |p205The  lunch crowd was gone and Sonny Duval was sitting waiting at the taverna like a big mustachioed frog , when we arrived back . He and Jane had gotten back from the Construction , he said , and Jane was out on the big caique cookingthe baby 's supper . Marie sat and had a drink with us , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was and what a great skin diver . I hustled her into a horsecab with her duffel bag and sent her back to town , and told her I would see her later . I would leave the fish with Dmitrios for her , for her to sell . I paid the driver . " The police were up at the Construction all afternoon , " Sonny said when I sat back down . " They went through everything , and everybody , like a finetooth comb . They wanted to know what we were doing up there . They checked our papers . " What did you expect ? You did n't have to go up there . " " We wanted to , " Sonny said . " Jane wanted to . " " Then do n't complain . " " They 're coming down here to the boat to see us . Probably tomorrow . " I was hardly even listening to him . I was still thinking regretfully about Marie , back there on the beach . And I was thinking about something else : I was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hippie living , Chuck and Steve . " Listen , there 's something I 'd like for you to do for me , "  |p206I  said . " I want to go up to the Construction . I want to go to Steve 's pad . Can you take me there ? " " I guess so . But are you sure you want to go up there ? You 're not very popular up there . " " That 's why I do n't want to ask directions . You can direct me . " All right , " he said , grudgingly . " But it 's hard to land the boat up there . " " We 'll take a horsecab . There 's a couple here . " In the horsecab he was silent for a while . If he was embarrassed by my having observed the unsubtle return of Kirk and Jane at noontime , he did n't show it . Then he said , " When are we gon na go spearfishing again ? " " We went yesterday . You were n't even interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In a couple of days . " At the moment I did n't care if I ever went spearfishing again . " I did n't know you were supposed to be so good . Listen , I suppose it 's useless , as well as an imposition , to ask , " he began . " Nothing special , " I said . " I just want to see him in his naturalhabitat . He interests me . " " Sure , " derisively . " If you want to know what I  --  " " I do n't , " I said . " Pete says he thinks you 're a U. S. Government man , posingas a private eye . " I looked at him . " Pete Gruner said that ? " I was mad . If Pete Gruner was going around bad mouthing me as a Governmentman , it was a sure sign he was one himself . Or was it ? And it was about as low as you could get . " Pete 's a guy who 's been around . Although there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm beginning to think he 's right , about you . " He grinned , " Jane thinks so . " " Let me tell you something about Jane , " I said brusquely . " What Jane does n't know about everything would fill many large volumes at Bennington . Jane is a spoiled brat . "  | " You just do n't want to understand Jane . None of you do . She 's a threat to all you male supremacists . " I stared at him in a kind of amazement . I had to snort . " Male supremacist ? That 's me , all right . " I thought about Marie . If this was bait for an argument , I was n't going to bite . But wait till I got hold of damned Pete Gruner . " Listen , the U. S. Government would n't be sending an agent down here because of a bunch of dropouts living in an abandoned Greek construction site and smoking hash , " I said . " Agents are expensive . " " There might be other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ? We must talk about that , " I said . But when he opened his mouth , I put my hand up and added quickly , " Some other day . " The horsecab was just passing the good old Hotel Xenia , scene of so much excitement in the life of Lobo Davies . In another minute he let us off at the foot of the same draw I had stood at the foot of that morning , with Pekouris . I paid him off . We started to climb the same little path I had climbed in the morning . It was dusk now , and falling dark fast . We climbed past cook fires , and hippie people moving around them . A smell of stew meat carried to us . We were climbing along the outside edge of the construction site . Sonny stopped . " It 's right up there , " Sonny said , pointing . " Fourth row from here , the second door in . You 'll have to go around to the back to find the stairs . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of these kids , if I were you , " he added . " Okay . Thanks . I 'll go ahead alone from here . " " You might get into a fight , you know . " " If I do , I 'll run . " He scuffed his foot in the raw dirt . " I suppose there 's no use in asking to go with you ? " He looked at me and saw there was n't . " Do you want me to wait for you down below ? "  | " There 's no reason . I can find my own way back . AssumingI get back . " I grinned . He stood a moment reluctantly . " Do n't worry , I 'll pay for your horsecab back , " I said . As if that clinched it , he turned and started down off the hill . I looked after him , then started to climb on . Around me the hippies were moving about their fires . At one fire I saw Georgina Taylor 's sun-dried prune face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At another a whole row of young American faces shone at me in the flickerylight . Someone chorded a guitar and sang folk music . I did n't know how I could tell they were American , but I could tell . Perhaps because of their inordinate naivete . Maybe they were n't so innocent , American kids . But they were sure as hell naive . Nobody was paying the slightest attention to me . I stopped and stepped in under one of the units on stilts , to watch a moment . It all seemed innocent enough . It certainly was n't any orgy . Not even of folk music . It was hard to believe that they might all jump on me and start beating the hell out of me , if they knew I was there . But I believed it to be at least a strong possibility . Then I heard a voice nearby that I recognized . It was coming from one of the housing units over my head , and it was the voice of Chuck , Steve 's myopic sidekick . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see into the unit through one of the window holes that nobody had ever put a frame on . Inside , Chuck and his glasses were sitting on a pile of cushions made from rags and old blankets . They were smokinga hookah and had a homemade turban on their head . The hookah obviously contained hash . And Chuck was high . Four chubby , wholesome-faced , little American collegegirls were rushing around ministering to his every demand . And his demands were many . The little girls lookedp209pathetic , as well as unattractive , in their loose-flowing , dirty Mother Hubbard dresses . They all undoubtedly had fat thighs . The scene was so bizarre that I stood a few moments transfixed , looking at it . One of those aluminum pack frames with sack attached leaned against the wall near Chuck , and leaningby it was a big South American type machete in a wood scabbard . The famous machete . Under the circumstances , it stood out . I stood looking another minute , mainly at the machete . The police had n't picked it up this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the outside of the debris-strewn construction site , to the row of units Sonny had pointed out to me . A light flickered from the apartment unit I was seeking , and I could hear voices and the low strumming of a guitar . Further up and around to the back I found the stairs Sonny had mentioned , and followed them up to the outside terrace along the front of the 4-unit building . Standing on the porch-terrace I was now 30 feet above the sloping ground . There was no railing . I made no attempt to hide myself when I came to the right door . I had no idea what I was going to say . I had n't come up here with anything in particular to say . I had just decided to come and play it by ear . The light was coming from two short candles stuck onto saucers . By them , young Steve was reading some kind of gibberish hippie poetry about the hard life of a longshoreman , from a mimeograph-printed poetry magazine . There were six people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to Steve and Diane . It was the new girl who was strumming the guitar , in a sort of accompaniment to Steve 's reading . Steve , bare to the waist , was truly beautiful physically , with his fine build and blond mane ,  |p210until  he looked up with those dead-seeming , non-seeing eyes . " Hello ! Is this a private party ? " I said in a chirpy way . I stepped inside . " Or can any old square sit in on it ? "  |p211They  all looked up at me . There was a sort of silence , and a belligerence blew at me like bad breath from all six of them . " Why do n't you just go away , Mr. Davies ? " Diane said , in a kind of cold angry wail . It was about the first word I had ever heard her speak . " I 'd love to , sweetheart , " I said . " I do n't like you any better than you like me . But I ca n't . Unfortunately , I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the police have been here all afternoon , " Steve said . " I know , " I said . " What do you want ? " " I can talk about it here , " I said . " But you might prefer to talk about it in private . " " Anything you got to say to me , you can say in front of my friends . " " " Okay . I want to talk about what you said to me in the square the other day . " " Wait a minute , " he stopped me . " I 'll come outside . " He looked around apologetically at the others , and got to his feet . The other three men had n't gotten to their feet , but they looked ready to . I followed Steve out . Outside , Steve led the way down to the ground . " Okay , " he said in a hate-filled voice . " Talk . " " You hollered something after me this morning that stuck in my head , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , do n't you ? ' I think those were the exact words . "  |p212He  would n't look at me . " So ? " he said sullenly . " I want to know what you meant . It seemed a peculiar thing to say . Under the circumstances . " " I do n't know what I meant . What difference does it make ? " I gave him a mock sigh of disgust . " Well , let 's analyze it . I assume you meant you did n't mean what you said when you threatened Girgis . But how would I know you did n't mean what you said ? You threatened Girgis pretty good there . And me , too . And then a couple of days later he 's dead . " " I did n't threaten to kill him . Do I look like a killer ? " He was still evasive , would n't look at me . I had a hunch he was hiding something . But what ? " You do n't look not like a killer , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Killers look like anybody . " " Chuck ? Chuck would n't hurt a fly . " " I would n't bet a dollar on it . " " Anh . You 're another pig . You 're one of them . You were talking me some high-toned guff about a grand jury . Did you ever hear of a grand jury in this country ? In Greece ? " He barked a short laugh . " The police were up here all afternoon . Asking questions , checking passports , nosing around . They went through our personal stuff . No warrants , no nothing . " I wondered how Chuck and his machete were still loose ? Was Pekouris not picking him up ? On purpose ? " Look , " Steve said , " I do n't have to talk to you . You do n't have any legal authority . " " That 's right , you do n't have to talk to me . " " If you have any authority , show me . Show me a badge . Or an official paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you son of a bitch ? " Without a word , crisply , I stepped in and hit him . It was n't a full punch . It was a short right hand , thrown off the right foot , with the right foot in front . But it was enough to knock Steve off his feet , and down.  |p213It  was a calculated risk . I did n't like the way the conversation was developing and I thought a punch on the jaw , if it did n't make him holler for help to try and ruin me , might make him think . Might change the tone and the direction . " I 'm partial about who calls me a son of a bitch , " I said . " Say I 'm old-fashioned . Get up , you . " He did , rubbing his jaw . He looked surprised and rueful . Although he was built like a muscle boy , he made no move to fight . " You 're a brave guy , man , " he said sullenly , still not looking at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would wind up looking like a played-over football field . All I have to do is holler . And not just upstairs . All over this place . " " Why do n't you holler ? " " And have you bring a regiment of cops down on us ? " " Look , I do n't like you any better than you like me , bud . If you 're an example of the new age , I feel sorry for it . But you 're in trouble . I 'm trying to give you a break . You better be damn well able to prove you 're not a killer . Where is this sidekick of yours ? You said this morning he was around . I want to talk to him . " I did n't know why I said it . It was a shot in the dark . But a lucky one . " He 's gone , " Steve said sullenly . " I sent him away . " That stopped me . I was dead quiet for a moment . " Youmean you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily . " No . Are you kidding ? He would n't make it to Athens . Letalone out of the country . No , I sent him off to St. Friday 's . " " What the hell is St. Friday 's ? " " It 's a chapel , in a little cove , around on the other side of the island . It 's called Ayia Paraskevi , in Greek . Paraskevi was some woman saint , but Paraskevi means Friday . We call it St. Friday 's . " " When did you send him ? " " This morning . As soon as I learned the police were coming . " Do the police know you did that ? "  | " Sure . Of course . I told them as soon as they asked where he was . " " But you do n't know whether they went around there and got him ? " " Not so far as I know . I 've still got his passport . " " You keep his passport for him ? " I asked . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided my gaze . That made me think . If Steve kept his passport for him , he was probably crazier then even I thought . " Tell me , " I said , " did it ever occur to you that he might come back here from over there , without telling you ? " Steve shot me a sharp look . " He would n't do that . " " You 're sure ? " " Absolutely . " " Okay . " I stepped back away from him . " What did you tell the police as to why you sent him over to St. Friday 's ? " " I told them the truth . I sent him there for a three-day fast . Because he 's been nervous since the murder . " " A three-day fast ! " " Yeah . What 's so funny ? That 's what we do , now and then , from time to time . All of us . Now , if you 've not got anythingfurther to rap about , may I go ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he the night of the murder ? " " He was with me . " " Oh , great , " I said . " And of course you were with him . What a super alibi . " " There were fifty kids as witnesses who saw us both at the Cloud 79 club until closing , " Steve said . I just looked at him , and shook my head . " Girgis was killedat 3:30 A.M. " " Well , we did n't close at the club until after that , that night . " " Have you got a lot to learn about Greek justice , " I said . He did n't answer me . " I hear your pal swings a mean machete , " I said.  |p215He  grinned at me mirthlessly . " You heard that , did you ? I figured somebody would get around to bringing that up eventually . Did you tell the police ? " It was curious how they always capitalized the word police with their voices , when they said it . " They already knew all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them who told me . " " They did ? I bet they did . Now may I go , Mister Pig ? " I felt my lips tighten . I let a long breath out through my nostrils . But all I said was , " Yes . " Then , just for fun , I added , " You 'll find Chuck down the way , in the third building below here . With four little girls . " He gave me a look , but did n't say anything . He turned and walked away . I watched him for a moment , then turned and started on back down the hill . Down at the other apartment unit , when I stopped and sneaked up again to check , myopic Chuck with his CocaCola-bottleglasses was still sitting with his hookah and his turban . The little girls were now sitting in an adoring circle at his feet . I backed away and walked on down the hill along the outside of the place . I needed time to think about it . It looked to me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to cover up for him . And it was entirely possible Chuck had killed him . Chuck was obviously a crazy , and who knew what a crazy would do ? I had seen him break that boy 's nose with a karate chop about the first night I was here . It was entirely possible the two of them were in it together . But what if they were guilty ? It bothered me why Pekouris had done nothing ? Why had n't he picked them and that machete up ? He had n't even picked up their passports . What was to stop them from taking off some dark night in a small boat for Turkey , with or without passports ? That was a cute trick , sending Chuck off to this St. Friday's.  |p216But  that would n't have stopped Pekouris if Pekouris had wanted to pick them up . Down at the bottom on the road , I stopped and turned around and looked back up at the weird place . What a commentit was on the state of our fouled-up civilization . You would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by God . Goofy or not , I was glad we still had them here . Off on my right as I stood looking up , the loud speakers from Steve 's Cloud 79 had begun to batter the air . I could see the colored lights through the trees , and the amplifiers would certainly tell me where it was even if I was blind . I was tempted to walk over and look it over . But I knew I would n't go . What was in store for me tonightwas not some night club but dead-weight , unexciting , ulcer-making work . That was what was in store for me . I thought of the money Kronitis had given me , Now I would have to begin to earn it . I walked over to the Xenia and caught a horsecab back to the house . At the taverna I picked up some sandwiches for my dinner and to keep me going later . At Georgina 's another hippie party was in progress in the garden . I avoided it . The old gal had hurried home with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell her that I would not be up to see her tonight . She had already heard about my skindiving trip with Sweet Marie . I told her I had work to do and if she did n't believe it she should stop by later and see me . Then I got out my locked briefcase and took out some pads of yellowlegal cap . I placed them neatly on the desk and after looking around on the ceiling for an excuse I could n't find , finally sat down with them . I had made up my mind about one thing . If Sweet Marie made me any more offers , of her carnal form , I was sure as hell going to take her up on them . And to hell with the moral tone.  |p217I  could n't work it out . I could n't formulate a working hypothesis . There were two big humps I simply could not get over . First , that every suspect stood to lose , and none of them stood to gain , by Girgis 's murder . And , the motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was only one motive available . The hashish trade . And as a motive that just simply would n't hold water . Even if it paid ten times the amount I calculated it was paying , it would n't be worth the chances you took in killing somebody over it . Killing Girgis amounted to the almost certain ruin of the hashish trade itself . There were only two real suspects . The two hippie boys ; and Jim Kirk . There were some peripheral suspicions . Chantal'sinvolvement with Girgis . The fact that Kronitis owned both boats . But they were negligible . Chantal 's deep shock when she learned of the murder was completely genuine , if I was any judge . And I would bet my bottom dollar that Kronitis did not know about the hashish smuggling until I told him . Jim Kirk was certainly a suspect . But he simply would n't have killed Girgis over the hashish trade . It was n't worth that much to him . That left the two kids . It was possible they were in it together , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy Chuck had done it on his own , thinking in his crazy way that he was helping his pal , the same way he had broken that boy 's nose that night , and now Steve was trying to cover up forp218him hoping to squeak him out of it . Given all the other facts we knew about Chuck , it was a high probability . That was the only answer I could come up with . And after working on it for eight straight hours , I was inclined to accept it . The thing that bothered me was that it was completelycircumstantial . The only other possibility was that there was another motive , with a vastly greater element of gain in it , which had been so cleverly concealed that I had received no inklingof it at all since I had been here . In a way I hated it to be Chuck because I hated crazy murders . I would rather it was Kirk . It would have been so much cleaner . So much more human . It was 5 A.M. when I locked up my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had eaten six greasy pork sandwiches that had nearly destroyed what digestion I had left , smoked two packs of cigarettes that put me that much further along the road to lung cancer , drunk five carefully measured drinks that had n't helped me at all as I intended they should n't , and I was tired . Chantal had not come by . I made myself a really important drink and went upstairs and went to bed . It was after 10 A.M. when Pekouris arrived down below in the jeep with two other policemen , to check out Sonny Duval . He waved up at me , before they walked down to the dock . I sat on my porch over the harbor with my coffee , and watched Pekouris show off in his blue suit and row them out , standing up in the skiff with the long , push-type oars . Everybody in Greece , or at least everybody I knew , seemed to be able to row a dinghy like a professional . The other two officers were strangers I had never seen before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ladder . It was hot and sunny where we were at the yacht harbor , but off over Sonny 's caique above the mainland a long bank of dark yellowish cloud was moving down from the northeast ,  |p219and  there was a stillness and absence of breeze that presagedsome weather . Half an hour later they rowed back to the dock and Pekouris drove the jeep over to my side of the vacant lot and parked it in the grass . He left the other two sitting in the sun . On his way up he made an elaborately polite greeting to the leathery Georgina who was pottering around in her hot garden . " Do you want a drink ? " I said when he came in . He just looked at me . He had a genius for rubbing me the wrong way . " Then to hell with you , " I said . " I 'll have one myself without you , then , Pekouris . " I called to the housekeeper . " Mama-san . Ice . " " I came to ask about your investigations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much , " I said . " I have n't done too much . Did you find a lot of incriminating evidence on Sonny 's boat ? " He gave me his superior thick-lipped smile . " That was only a routine call . He is , as you say , clean . " " Well , you upset him enough by it , " I said . He grinned . " I hope so . He is not a man I find I can like easily . Nor his wife . But he is clean . I did not expect to find anything . " I smiled . " So you just wanted to blow his mind a little ? " I did n't know if I liked that or not . I guessed I did . " I 've been doing some homework , though , " I said , " if I have n't done much else . And I 've about reached the same conclusion you already arrived at . It looks like it has to be that boy with his machete . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " He 's got a machete with him here , you know , " I said . Pekouris nodded . " Well , just curiosity , but why did n't you pick him up ? " " He was not there when we were there . He had gone off around to Ayia Paraskevi . " I did n't know what it was about him that I just couldn'tp220cotton to . But I just could n't appreciate him . Could n't he give a straight answer , once ? " Would n't it have been easy to run around there in a boat and pick him up ? " I said patiently . Pekouris made a nastier than usual smile . " Yes . Yes , it would . But I do not think you understood my Athens directiveyesterday , when I told it to you , Davies . I was told by Athens to : Solve it , but solve it fast . The emphasis was on the Fast . " Apparently calling me just " Davies " like that was some form of slightly more intimate address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sounded condescending , dictatorial , domineering , superior , and snotty . I did n't like that about him , either . " I see . So ? " " Well , is it not self-evident ? If I pick this boy up now , an American , there would be an enormous publicity in the press , and a long drawn-out court case . I might not even convict him . If he were a Greek . " He shrugged . " It would be a different matter . But he is not . And that is not solving it fast , as my directive ordered me . " He suddenly looked a little peaked , Pekouris . Like a man being pulled two ways by exactly equal forces . But he was n't going to admit that to me . There was his duty as he liked to conceive it , and his duty as his Athens superiors preferred him to conceive it . I wanted to feel sorry for him . But it was n't easy . " I need some real evidence . Or a confession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect . " " And in the meantime , these two boys may just up and hightail it out of here on a small boat , to Turkey . " " Highly unlikely . Believe me , they would never get there . " It sounded like a face-saving pronouncement to me . But maybe he could back it up . " Well , " I said . " Listen , speaking of evidence . I happened to be with someone yesterday . "  |p221Pekouris  smiled . " Yes , I know . " I blinked once at him , slowly . " And this somebody told me something interesting . Not long ago a bunch of these kids stole some goat and killed it and roasted it . This boy Chuck decapitated it with his machete . Fine . But then he went around with the goat 's blood on the machete without washing it off , and bragging about it . " Pekouris was watching me intently . " Yes ? I do not entirely follow your reasoning . " " Well . If he would do that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might do the same with human blood ? " Pekouris nodded . " I see . Yes , it 's just possible . Especially with a crazy man . " " Is there any way of separating and distinguishing dried goat 's blood from dried human blood on a knife ? " " I would have to ask a doctor about that . " " I do n't know enough , medically . " " Nor do I. Anyway , do not concern yourself with that . I will find out all about that from our laboratory . It 's an excellentidea . " But I am not going to arrest the boy and confiscate the machete now . First , I want to find out what the laboratory tells me . " " Well , I can hardly confiscate it for you , " I said . " Or steal it for me . " " I do not ask you to , " Pekouris said , humorless to the end . " This just might solve all our problems , " he said , more to himself than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not holding it up as any great possibility , " I said . He moved away from the chair he had been standing beside . " I 'll be in touch with you about the laboratory . " He pronounced it like the English : laboratory . Ponderously , in his ponderous way , he moved toward the three steps down into the hallway to the door . " Hey , wait a minute , " I said . " What about Jim Kirk ? What are you doing about him ? "  |p222Pekouris  turned . " He is being looked into . " " You know he was in with Girgis , do n't you ? He 's a suspect , too , you know . " He blinked at me solemnly . " No stone is being left unturned , Davies , " he said . He turned and went down the steps . I watched him go out . Then I walked out to my porch to watch him drive away . He was just about not believable . I watched him climb into the jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were still sitting there obediently in the sun . After he was gone , Sonny Duval walked up along the seawall from the taverna , looking up at me . He did n't come inside the gate . " You saw ? " he called . " I 've been given a clean bill of health . " I just nodded . " Listen , " he called up . " Will you be wanting the boat ? It looks like one of those quick summer storms . We almost never get them . But when we do , they blow like hell for a couple of hours . " As he spoke , the first fingerlings of rising breeze blew dust swirls up from around his feet in the dry graveled road . It was hotter now , if anything . Muggy heat . I looked off toward the bank of cloud to the northeast . You could see the blue sheets of rain falling from it in long parallelograms . " No , I wo n't want it , " I called down . He shrugged his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taverna again . I went inside and picked a book in English off one of the shelves . It was somethingcalled Bitter Lemons , by Lawrence Durrell , about Cyprus . I sat down with it on the porch and told the old Greek woman to bring me some whisky , and that I 'd eat lunch there.  |p223The  prospect of a rainy day made me feel I did n't have to do anything . My lunch was the first meal my Greek housekeeperhad made for me . It was pretty hard to ruin plain scrambled eggs , but she managed it . I put down a whole bottle of red wine with it , and took my book back out on the protected porch with a brandy . Chantal had not called . I was sort of glad . The bank of yellow cloud had continued to come on out of the northeast , and the excited feeling of a storm had fallen over the harbor . A steady rain began to fall . The wind had n't abated and the sea was up , making the boats rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everythingwas battened down and seemed suddenly empty of people . I sat and watched it like you would watch an excitingmovie . Outside in the rain the ship 's bell over the upper garden gate jangled , and then the front door bell rang . The old Greek woman opened it . A tallish long-legged long-haired blonde young woman in skintight blue jeans and a bra-less thin cotton shirt came in . She said hello to the maid in Greek . " Hello there , Mr. Davies ! " My dirty black old heart sort of skipped a beat . I stood up , out on the porch , as she came leggily down the living room toward me , slightly damp . She obviously knew the house . And I , standing drink in hand , suddenly saw that long body nude , the way I had seen it yesterday pulling off thep224black wet suit . And the day before yesterday , striding naked into the water at the hippie beach . And today ? Well , today  --  such a nice quiet cozy rainy today  --  was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gosh it 's raining ! " she said breathlessly , in her halfchildishway . " A lot of wind ! But I think it 'll blow over by this evening ! " That eternal cheerfulness , on that perpetual brink of disaster . " Yes , " I said . " Well , come on out . You did n't go out today , hunh ? Did n't go spearfishing ? " " No . Actually , it 's all right on the lee side out of the wind . But I do n't like it somehow , in the rain . It puts me down . And anyway I somehow found myself thinking about you all morning . Somehow . " " You did , did you ? " I said . " So I thought I 'd come pay you a visit ! You told me to , once , if I ever felt like it . And I thought you probably would n't be out on your boat , today ! " " It 's funny . I was just thinking about you , too , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " She looked down at her body . " Gosh , I 'm all damp . " She was , and it made the cotton shirt cling closer to her . She went over to the railing and looked up at the sky . " Yes , this 'll blow over ! Tomorrow 'll be clear ! " Then , much softer , " What were you thinking about me ? " " You want me to be blunt ? " I said . " Be blunt , " Marie said . " I like you when you 're blunt . " " I was thinking about how you 're affected by this killing . You 're very likely to be out of a job , do you know it ? Becausethis thing is going to put an end to the hashish business for some time . That 's going to put a bad cramp in your sources of income . " " Yes , it sure is . That 's what 's so good about you , you know it ? You clear all the shit away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to talk to you about . " She looked straightp225at me , open-eyed , honest . " That , and the fact that I 've been thinking about you so . " Suddenly she shrugged her hands out , then slapped them against her thighs . " But I 'd rather not talk about it all here . " " I do n't know where we could go , " I said . " Some bar ? " " We could go to my little place , " she said . " I have a room in a private house , where I lived last winter . I 'm not using it much now in the summer . I stay up at the Construction . But I have the key ? " I did n't say anything . It was funny , you did n't have to do a thing . They would do it all for you . If they decided they wanted a chunk of you . I gave her a long moment 's look . She looked straight back . There was n't much doubt about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . " All right , " I said . " Let me finish my drink . " I tossed it off . Suddenly she giggled . I looked up at her in time to catch something dark that flashed out at me from her eyes . For a split second she looked like an old whore soliciting in a dark hotel doorway . At the door she said , " You better put something on . In this rain . " " What about you ? " " I 'm wet already . Anyway , I do n't mind it . I like it . And I can change down there . " Again the silent rider . I put on my old trenchcoat . Then my beat-up old New Yorker 's hat . In the hall mirror I suddenly looked tougher , older , more mean , more like a cop . The hat and trenchcoat looked weird , over my resort clothes and sandals . " Now I look more like what I am , " I said . " And more like my daddy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-aged private dick . Who no longer believes in anybody . And would n't give his own grandmother change of a dollar . For fear of being shortchanged . And rightly so . "  |p226Still  smiling she opened the door for us . Her room was down in toward the town . So we took the upper street , above the house . Twice , when flurries of rain hit us , she huddled against me . But mostly she walked openly in the rain . Twice she put her head back and closed her eyes , lifting her face to feel it . When we got to the house , her hair was wet and her clothes half soaked . But by then I was out of the game . I did n't know what had changed my mind . Was it the look I had suddenly got of myself in that hall mirror ? Maybe it was the way she threw back her head to the rain . I could never have done that , not without laughing . Whatever it was , I knew I could n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huddled against me , for protection , when the rain flurries hit us . I remembered my own two daughters huddling against me in the exact same way , when some tiny disaster in their lives had hit them and they did n't know what to do about it . Except huddle against daddy . Like Marie . Only , Marie 's disaster was a big one . Maybe mostly , it was because I was too old . Old enough to be ridiculous . The house was a nondescript one , with the regular walled garden . She led me back along a walk beside the house to a private door . Inside , it was a poor cheap little room with nothing of anything in it . She had added nothing of herself to it . She could have moved out in five minutes . The room hurt me , too . Only her diving gear , in one corner , scrupulously cleaned , marked it as hers . " Such as it is , " Marie said . She shut the door . I turned around and stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the personality they inflicted on me . When I turned back Marie was standing looking at me with that open , childish face . Maybe she was breathing a little fast . For a split second that same strange , odd , dark look crossed her face . Then it was gone . To describe it as whorish was too strong , but I guessedp227it had that in it . A masochism , maybe . Of some special femalekind ? A kind of whorish delight . " I 'd better change , " she said , and half-sitting on the little bed , stripped off her shirt and picked up a towel . She never wore a bra , of course . Her breasts were young , and the size of a large cup . There was a shy , vulnerable movement about her , as she dried herself . She dried the breasts first . She did n't look at me . " And I 'd better dry my hair , " she said . The breasts jiggled deliciously , as she moved the towel . Especially when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man under some attack . I had n't had time or a chance to move . I stood with my back jammed back against the door . I felt my face getting tighter . " Do you want to help ? " Marie asked , looking up through her hair . " No thanks . " I said it harsher than I meant . The towel around her shoulders , she tossed her hair back , and stood up . That funny odd " whorish " look was back on her face openly . She unbuckled her jeans belt and unzippedthe fly , and pushed her jeans down and stepped out of them . She began to dry her legs , and her belly . I just stood there . It was one hell of a body she had on her . If she knew how bad I wanted it , I guessed she would be pleased . My hands were jammed down tight and clenched in my pockets . I relaxed them . She straightened , holding the towel in front of her , but not at all protectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said hoarsely . " Put some clothes on . " " You do n't like me ? " " I like you a lot . Now cut it out . It would n't work . " That strange look went off her face , and the young girl'slook came back on it . " Do you think I 'm a whore ? " " If I thought you were a whore , it would work . " " Well , I am a whore . " " And I 'm old enough to be your father . Now cut it out . "  | " I told you I thought I 'd try some incest . " She laughed , a girlish tinkle , from that lovely lush nude body that made my teeth ache . Her crotch was lean and sturdy and built for wear and beautifully hairy . " I 've tried everything else . " " It would n't work , " I said . " You 'd have a bad feeling afterward . Little girls should n't do things that leave a bad feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did you know I had an affair with Jane Duval ? " she said . She half turned . " Hand me those pants , " she said . I stepped and got a dry pair of jeans and a shirt lying with them and tossed them to her . " No , " I said . " I did n't . But I do n't see why not . And it does n't surprise me . Everybody else has . " " Except you . " She turned sideways and stepped into the jeans demurely and pulled them up . " Except me , " I said . Turning her back , she put the shirt on . Then she turned and sat down on the bed . " Do n't ever do that to me again , " I said , and grinned . " I have n't got that strong a heart . And I 'm no iron man . " The grin felt pretty cracked . She just looked at me , with that open girlish look , and did n't say anything . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ashamed of myself , " she said . " But I 'm not . It 's a shame , really . " " You 'll feel better about it this way , " I said . " But you wanted me . Did n't you want me ? Terribly ? " " Terribly . As much as I 've ever wanted any woman in my life . More . " " Then why did n't you just take me ? " " Because if I 'm going to be your substitute father around here , " I said , " I did n't think it would look good . " " I 'm really glad that you did n't do it , really . " " Good . Fine . That 's great . And I 'm just beginning to feel sorry . Look , " I said . " You said you wanted to talk to me about Girgis ? "  | " I wanted to ask your advice about something . It was n't really about Girgis . It was about Jim Kirk . " " So what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a drink . She rummaged around , found a bottle of Scotch , and a split of soda . I sat down with it on the one chair . Outside , the rain drummed audibly . My ears had stopped hearing it there for a while . " I 'm sorry there 's no ice . " " I do n't need any ice , " I said . " What about Kirk ? " She had made herself a stiff drink , too . She put down half of it on the first try , then sat on the bed . " This whole thing has upset me terribly . I 've had nightmaresabout it . " Suddenly , she shuddered . She smiled , but her mouth had that sudden quiver . " Cutting off his head like that . Anyway , I 'm thinking of leaving Tsatsos . " " I think that 's a good idea , personally , " I said crisply . " Kirk wants me to stay , " she said . " You said I 'd be out of a job running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be for a couple of weeks . Then he will start operating again . And he wants me to do the same thing for him that I did for Girgis . " " I could n't advise you about that , " I said coldly . " Two weeks ? That sounds like Kirk 's got some kind of special pull around here , that I do n't know about . " " But you 're smarter . But maybe he does have pull , as you say . Because he 's been bringing some heroin on the island , you know . Did you know that ? "  | " Has he ! " I said . " You would n't know what his source is , would you ? " " I guess , Athens . There 're some addicts up at the Construction . Slow John 's one of them . Kirk runs in just enough for them . He charges double what it costs in Athens , John says . Jim says it 's for the risk he takes . " " Was Girgis involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Girgis would n't touch H. That old Ambassador Piersonis an addict , too . " " How does Kirk get the H to these people ? " " I carried it for him up at the Construction . " I shook my head . Then I set my glass on the floor and got up . I was angry , and I had to hold myself down . " That 's pretty damn dumb . You can get busted , and busted bad , anywhere for that . Do n't you know that ? " " I only did it as a favor . He slipped me a few bucks . " " Legally , it makes no damn difference . And H is dynamite right now . That 's why they 're all so secretive about it . " I was thinking about Chantal , at that exact moment . Marie just looked at me , then suddenly smiled that hurt smile of hers that always got to me . " I know . Oh , to hell with it . " She did n't say anything for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his H supply could be Chantal 's further secret ? That I never could get hold of ? But why would she hide that from me ? " It 's all so dirty , is n't it ? " Marie said . " Oh . No more than any other line of endeavor . " I gave her one of my better smiles . " In my business , you 're in danger of getting to believe it 's all dirty . And everybody along with it . And that 's bad . Do n't get like that . " " It could n't be all dirty if you were in it , " Marie said . I gave her a hard look . " Do n't be too sure of that , either , sweetie . " " I 'm sure of it about you .  --  Anyway , it 's because the price of H is so high here , that John wants to leave Tsatsos . And he wants me to go with him . "  |p231Outside  , the rain seemed to have stopped . " John ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If I go . I figured you 'd love that . " " Where would you go ? " I said . " To Capri . He wants to take a house in Capri for a month or two . He 's been there before . And he wants to take me with him . " " What if he takes off and leaves you in Capri ? " " I suppose I could always do something . I guess I could Spearfish there as well as here . " " Capri 's a lot different from here . I hear it 's a pretty wild , wide-open place . It 's supposed to be crawling with fags and rich swingers . " " Fags would never bother John . Or me , either . " " No , " I said . " But where there are fags there 're also lesbians . They follow each other . " There was a pause from Marie . " Oh . Yes , " she said . " Yes , there 's that . I guess . " I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're no fez . If you were , what the hell ? Who cares ? But you 're not . I 'm not thinking of you so much . But if John 's propensity for extra girls is as strong as you say it is ? He could get you involved with some pretty bad types , like that . They 're all lezes , those extra-girl types . And then go off and leave you there . I 'm not sure you 're strong enough to handle those types . A lot of lezes work the racket . Rich swingers pay high . And one of the biggest payoffs is for fresh meat . New young meat . Like you . Do you think you could tell the straight ones from the bent ones ? " I said harshly . " I do n't know , " Marie said from the bed . She would n't look at me . " Probably not . " " Well ? " I said . " Look , have you thought about what I said yesterday ? About going back home ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of distraughtgesture . " It 's all such a mess , is n't it ?  --  " Yes , I 've thought about it . But it 's so hard . It 's not onlyp232just the money . Where would I go ? I would n't know anybody ? I 'd be starting all over , cold turkey , in a cold new town ? It 's too much . " " All right , damn it , I 'll help you get out of it , " I said grimly . " I 'll give you my address in New York . If you can get the money together , you come back to New York . You look me up . You wo n't be alone that way . You ought to be able to hold down some kind of job . I 'll help you get one . Hell , I 'll even spring for the money . " " Would you really do that ? I can get the money . I 'll make John give it to me . " " It would seem he owed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I would n't bet on getting it . " " You 'd really do that ? " " Sure . " " Can we talk about it later ? I 'm all confused right now . But I think I 'll do it , if you really mean it . " " I mean it . " " Not about the money . That other part , I mean . " " I mean it . " " That 's the most important part , is having some friend . " I opened the door behind me , and gave her a grin . " Theremust be some decent husbands still left around somewhere . We 'll find you one . " " Look , I 'm going spearfishing tomorrow . Do you want to go out ? And talk about it then ? We could take the boat . " " I ca n't . I 've got things I 've got to do , " I said . " Another day , though . " From the bed she smiled her wounded smile at me . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All right , Big Daddy . You really are Big Daddy , you know that ? " " Oh , nuts , " I snarled , and stepped back outside and shut the door.  |p233The  squall was swiftly blowing itself away behind the hills . I folded my trenchcoat into a roll under my arm and carried the hat . It was so dry the rain seemed hardly to have dampenedthe bare dirt along the edges of the cobbled street . The air had a fresh smell . I guessed I looked pretty ridiculous . With Marie , either way I went I had to look silly . Nobody in his right mind would turn down a girl that lovely . Instead , me , I had to go and acquire myself another responsibility . I could afford her plane fare , and a little living money . We 'd let Mr. Kronitis pay that . I had several younger friends , girls , in New York . Where she could bunk up for a while . It was n't the first time I had done something like this for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had ever had a body like that . But that was n't the whole problem , and I knew it . The whole problem had to do with something else . That was the part I had n't wanted to think about , and still did n't . The whole problem had to do with age . My age . I was having serious difficulty avoiding it . I supposed it was a problem everybody had to face , if he lived long enough . That did n't help me . I still did n't like it . And I still did n't want to think about it . The rough cobbles under my feet were already bone dry of rain . With the storm past I felt I ought to get back to doingsomething . But what ? Nothing Marie had told me about Kirk had made me feel any different about the murder . Ip234decided to go up and have a look at the Cloud 79 night club tonight . I walked on home and called Chantal . She was home . She had another one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly did n't want to go to that . I told her I might be up to see her late , but that also I might not . " Is she as good as I am ? " she said . I did n't answer her . " I 'll bet there are a couple of things she ca n't do as well as I do , " Chantal said . I expected she was right . There were a couple of things I could think of . Marie certainly could n't do them any better . " I do n't like your social dinners , sweetie , " I said . " And I do n't have to go to them . I 've made some friends of my own , on my own level , down here in the Port . " " All of them with long long legs , no doubt . " Her voice sounded sharper . " I 'll try and get up there late , " I said . " But if I should n't , do n't fret over it . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dick as a lover . " " Well , if I 'm not there when you get there , " Chantal said in a lofty Countess voice , " and I may not be , just go right on in and make yourself at home . I 'll get there eventually . " She hung up . I hung up myself , and walked out on my porch . I 'd gone as far as I could with her . I supposed I could have told her I was working for Kronitis . But I had promised Pekouris I would n't tell anybody . Actually , I intended to get up there if I possibly could . If Chantal was carrying even small bits of H for Kirk among the high-born , the way Marie was among the low-born , it was something I wanted to talk to her about . On the porch I leaned my hands on the thick stone railing . At the taverna across the vacant lot Pete Gruner andhis beard , in another expensive coat , were sitting at a table . I thought a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taverna to join them . I waved at Georgina as I went past her little outdoor living room . Gruner had clearly seen me coming . I took a table off by myself . He came over and slipped into a chair . " Okay , what did you want to see me about ? " " What makes you think I wanted to see you ? " I said . " I thought you wanted to see me . " " Because I happened to be sitting at your private taverna here ? Sure . " Strangely enough I was beginning to kind of like him , in a masochistic way . " Well , you do n't generally hang out down here . It 's more your style to hang around up at the Constructionwith your buddies . " He grinned . " Well , actually I did want to see you . " " Let 's take mine first , " I said . " It seems you 've been going around throwing eggs on me telling people you suspected I was some kind of a Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " It seems that you did , " I said . " I have n't thrown any eggs back yet . But I 'm all ready to . I 'm eager to . Can you tell me anything that might deter me ? " He gave me a snide grin . " I did say something to one person . Jim Kirk . But it was n't Government . I said I thought you were down here working for some very big outfit . " " Big enough to be the U. S. Government , " I said . " He told it that way to at least one other person . One more little piece of gamesmanship like that from you , and I 'll ruin your image good , friend . I have n't done it yet . " He grinned . " I knew you were a good guy . Underneath that phony heart-of-gold routine of yours . I 'm sorry about that other . I had to do it . If I could tell you why , you 'd understand . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not the sweettemperedboy you think I am . Now , what 's your bad news ? " His face took on the flush of a crowing rooster . " I wantedto tell you I 've got that job I was telling you about . I'mp236going to work as Mate on the Polaris . I talked to the big man . " That slowed me . " You saw Kronitis ? " " I talked to him on the phone . I 'm to see him in a couple of days . If it works out , I 'll be promoted to run the boat . " " Where are you meeting him ? At his villa ? " " No , in Glauros . At that big hotel . It was easy enough to get hold of him . I just called him up , like this kid Steve did , about his bar . " I made no comment on any of that . " Why are you coming here telling me all this ? " He grinned . " I just wanted you to know . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where to look . Start looking for what 's left of me on that Polaris boat . " " I 'm not going to go looking for you anywhere , bud , " I said grimly . " I 'm not getting paid to . Do you want to tell me why you 're doing it ? " " I 'm going into the hashish business . With Kirk . That was why I had to lay a little heavy on you with Kirk . Kirk carries a lot of weight with Kronitis , and I 'll need Kirk to bring in the stuff . Kronitis does n't know , of course . I had to promisehim I would n't indulge in any hashish smuggling . Kirk and I will split fifty-fifty . Kirk is satisfied , Kronitis is satisfied , and I 'm satisfied . " " That 's not the why , " I said . " That 's the how . " " It 's the why . Hell , in a year it 'll net me enough to buy me my own boat . And I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And I 'll be able to fly over here from New York and charter your boat for years to come , " I said . " Go ahead , con me some more . " He just grinned . " Maybe someday I 'll be able to tell you a little more , Lobo . About my plans . " " Sure , " I said . " You can tell me the next time I 'm in Washington . " He shook his head . " Just remember what I told you aboutp237the Polaris , " he said , and got up . He threw some bills on the table . He was about the only one who ever paid a tab around there , except for me . That alone made him rare . " See you , " he said , and winked . He went walking away with that long-waisted athlete 's walk of his , his well-kept long hair swinging . I just sat and looked after him . I 'd sort of hate to see him dead . It was beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table over to one of the tables laid with a cloth for the dinner trade and motioned the waiter.  |p238I  did n't know what kind of trouble to expect up there at Steve 's Cloud 79 , so I did n't eat a big dinner . I put away a few extra Scotches , instead . I expected some kind of a jolly reception . I figured I could handle five of them . But I could n't handle ten . It would take a Ray Nietschke or a Mean Joe Green to handle ten . I carried a flathead sap in my briefcase , but I did n't take it . It was . a precision instrument . I did n't want it against these kids . In a wild melee you could accidentally kill somebody with it , very easily . The horsecab from Dmitri 's parked me at the foot of the path up to the club . The path led up through some trees and rocky outcrop to a little plateau below the Construction . I took it . Down below the horses ' hoofs and cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen cabs to wait . You could hear the blare of folk rock at least as far away as the Xenia hotel . It was a pretty place for an outdoor club . On the little plateau , above the screen of trees , you could look out to sea and the nearby islands , and to Glauros on the mainland . But they had n't done much with it . Steve was saving Kronitis 's money for himself , I guessed . Three plywood and tarpaper shacks had been thrown up , and a rickety fence strung between them , to get inside of which you had to pay . I paid . When I handed in my 6o drachs , the long-haired boy on the gate gave me a startled , hard look . I grinned at him , and winked . Inside , everything about the place had been done onp239the cheap the same way . A warped wooden dance floor of junk lumber had been laid down in sections . The junk tables and chairs , throw-aways from the cafes and tavernas in town , looked dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of it , the place was doing an enormous business and everybody seemed to love it . A lot of young Greek locals were there , a lot of rich kids of summer residents , and a lot of the Athenian tourists . And , of course , a lot of hippies from the Construction . A number of kids danced barefoot on the packed dirt around the edges of the dance floor . The word that I was there went ahead of me . As I 'd expected . The boy at the door had passed it on . A wave of sullen anger passed across the dance floor and through the tables , when the hippies saw me . The others , the locals and the rich kids , did n't notice me . I sat down at a rusty table , and stolidly ordered a Scotch . I had n't expected any different . A lot of people were seated around . Steve and Diane were at a sort of favored , owner 's table . Myopic Chuck was with them . Georgina Taylor was sitting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she saw me , and avoided looking in my direction . Right next to them were Sweet Marie and Slow John . With John and Marie was Jason , the Paris " recording star " , so stoned on hash he kept falling over . John and Marie had to keep proppinghim up . Nearby was the elegantly bearded Gruner , smiling as always . On his way to the dance floor with some hippie girl type Gruner paused , with a sardonic grin , and said hello . " I wo n't sit , " he grinned . " You understand why . " " Sure , " I said , and grinned back . He was a good-looking guy , Gruner . Be a shame if anything happened to him . But I could n't worry about that now . I tossed off the rest of my drink and ordered another.  |p240When  I reordered , Steve got up and sauntered over . With a flick of his blue eyes Steve stopped my waiter . Behind him at the table Chuck got up , too . But Diane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been told to stay away . She tried to make him sit back down , but he refused . There was a definite authority about Steve , here in his own joint . I could see why Marie said he had the flair . It was a little flagrantly displayed , maybe . " I 'd rather you did n't order that second one . " I looked up at him . " Oh ? How come ? You mean you 're buying one ? " " No . I 'm asking you to leave . " I pursed out my lips . " What if I do n't want to ? " " It would be easy for me to have you thrown out . " I let my eyes run around at all the hippies all around me . One by one they dropped their gaze , as mine swept past them . " I do n't think so . I do n't think you 've got the muscle . Certainly not without creating such a rumpus you 'd get your joint closed down . They 're just waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I turned suddenly to the waiter , another youngster from the Construction . " Here . You . Young man . Bring me a bottle of Scotch . " The waiter looked at Steve . " Tell him not to bring it , " I said . " Go ahead . " Steve stared at me , expressionless . With those weird , stoned eyes . " Go ahead , " I said . His knuckles were resting on the table top . I watched them turn white . For a long moment he did n't move a muscle . Then slowly , he lowered his eyelids in a slow blink of assent to the waiter . The waiter nodded a jerky nod , and went off to the bar . I grinned at Steve . " Why do n't you sit down ? Take a load off your feet , and save a little face at the same time . "  |p241He  slid into one of my chairs . Behind him Chuck had come up in a slow , consciously ominous way . He made as if to slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You do n't sit at my table , Four Eyes . " It was an appellation I suddenly remembered from my childhood . Back then , it was the worst insult you could call a boy who had to wear glasses . I did n't think things had changed that much in a generation . He reacted just the way I hoped he would . Behind his glasses his magnified , enormous eyes went a wild , crazy enormous fiery red . A bubble of spittle pooled at a corner of his mouth . As he hunched forward , his voice came out in that high , low-keyed , falsetto scream I 'd heard before . " I do n't have to take that from you , you punk bastard ! I 'll break your face . I 'll break your teeth ! I 'll pop out your eyeballs ! You wo n't have a solid bone in your punk body ! " I just looked at him . But I had my feet together under me . I 'd looked him over and he did n't have anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't show . But before either of us could move , Steve was on his feet in front of Chuck and pushing against him with his chest , pushing him backward . " All right , now . All right , now . " " Tell him to go away and sit down , " I said , calmly . But the crazy murderousness I 'd seen had my heart thumping regularly in my ears . I 'd found out what I 'd wanted to know , anyway . He was perfectly capable of what I thought he was capable of . Especially if insulted properly . Girgis was a great insulter of hippies . " You heard what he said , " Steve said . " You go and sit with Diane . Take care of Diane for me . " " I do n't have to ! " Chuck whispered . " I do n't have to take it ! " " Go on , " Steve said . Slowly , he bellied him back away from me . And after a moment Chuck turned and walked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Diane . He walkedp242to the entrance lane , and then out through the fence and into the night . " Where 's he going ? " I said . " To get that machete of his ? " " You think about that machete a lot , " Steve said . He sat back down , and grinned , and shook his head . But his face was white under his tan . " Machete ? What machete ? " I said . " I do n't know anything about any machete . " " He would n't need that machete to take you , " Steve said seriously . " He 's tough . " " He 's also crazy , " I said . " As a bedbug . " " You take an awful lot of chances , mister . " " That 's how I get my kicks , " I said . " Because I really honestly do n't give a damn . And I like to fight . Especially kid karate experts . " Steve looked at me with contained , but unconcealed hatred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " I grinned . " Just the lucky chosen few . " Behind me the young waiter came up with the bottle I had ordered . He put it on the table with some new glasses . He did n't set it down lightly . He was as angry as the rest . " You took an awful chance just coming here , you know . " I poured a drink for myself . Then I poured one for him . He did n't touch his . " I figured you would n't let your pals beat me up right in your joint . " " No , but I 'm not responsible for what happens to you once you 're outside that fence . " I just grinned at him . " Of course not . " " Would you mind telling me how you knew he was n't at St. Friday 's ? " I borrowed a line from Pekouris . " Oh , I have my little ways . Of finding out all sorts of things . Why do n't you go and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " Are you crazy ? After what you said to him ? Go and get him yourself . If you think you want to . "  |p243I  smiled . " No , I guess not . I do n't want to give away any more odds , to go up in there alone this late at night . I figure I 've given away enough , coming here . " " You sure have . " " I do n't see how you figure it , " I said . " You two boys are prime suspects in a murder case . You ought to go to the policeand prove your innocence . " " I figure if we sit tight , we 'll be all right . We 're not withoutfriends . " " You mean like your rich silent partner ? " " He 's one . " I did n't disillusion him . " You want to know what I think ? I think probably you two did it together . " That got to him . For the first time . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did it ever occur to you we might both be innocent ? " I grinned at him . " I 've thought of that . It 's not a good money bet . " " You 're one of those people who instinctively hates any life-style that 's not his own , Mr. Davies . " " Is that the way you figure it , huh ? But what interests me is what 're you going to do . You ca n't hide him . Not here . " " Who says I need to hide him ? " I shrugged . " Nobody . And he could never make it to Athens and get on a plane . " " There are other things . " " Sure . If he runs  --  and even makes it somewhere , like Turkey , on a little boat  --  Interpol will have his picture all over Europe and the Middle East in two days . You want him to live on the hop in the Middle East ? I do n't think you 've got the connections . " " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbed blind in five days . You 'd never be able to trust a soul . You 've never really lived in the real lower depths . I have . There 's no milk of human decency down there.  | " It 's a good thing for us the police did n't hire you , is n't it ? " Steve said . He got to his feet . I looked up at him quizzically . " Tell me something , are all the hippies like you two ? Where 's all this peace and humankindness stuff I 've been hearing so much about ? " " We offer . It is n't often accepted . " " So you start hitting back . Like everybody else . Hunh ? Like me . What 's so different ? " I looked around the place . All I saw was sullen anger . " You want to know what I think ? I think you 're all hypocrites . All of you . And all of these . " Take away the long hair and the wild clothes and you 're nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hash to , " I looked around again , " a bunch of ordinarymiddle-brow suckers  --  who think they 're different too because their clothes and hair are different . Hypocrites . " And your sidekick is just a punk , a paid gunny , a bodyguardwho happens to use a machete instead of an iron . " Steve 's knuckles , resting on the tin table , clenched themselves into a fist . He nodded once and walked away without a word . But at least I had gotten my little speech in . Why not , since I was going to pay up for it in a little bit ? I gave myself the right . Feeling savage , I poured myself another drink from the bottle and looked around . The hippies around me all looked away sullenly . The others , the locals and the rich kids , did n't even know what was going on . I did n't see how . The atmosphere was as charged as an electrical storm cloud bank that had n't flashed yet . Across the way Sweet Marie got up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat down . " I think you ought to leave , Mr. Davies . " " I 'll leave in a little bit , " I said . " Please , I wish you 'd leave now . They all hate you . They all think you 're some kind of cop . I 'm afraid something will happen if you stay . "  | " Nothing 'll happen as long as I 'm here , " I said . " It 's after I leave that it 'll happen . " " Please go . " " Have you thought about what we talked about ? " " I 've thought about almost nothing else . I 'm going to do what you suggested . But  --  " she shrugged guiltily . " I ca n't get the money from John . He wo n't give it to me . " " Then take it from me . Like I said . Consider it a loan . You can pay me back when you 're settled in New York . " In her open sweet way she squeezed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " You 're really somethingspecial , do you know that ? " " I see you 've got that boy Jason on your hands . " " He 's going back to Paris , " she said . " He 's broke . " " I hope he can still sing , when he gets there . " I looked over at Jason . " It always seems to come down to the money , in the end , does n't it ? " " It seems to . It should n't . Now will you please go ? " " Yes . " She gave me a long , worried look and left , and I poured myself another drink . After drinking it , I left money , picked up the bottle and started to make my way out . As I got up , two of the hippies sitting farthest from me slipped out of their seats and slipped off into the dark around the dance floor the other way . I grinned to myself after them . At Steve 's table I paused . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to catch it , or let it fall and smash . " Here , " I said . " A present . " I waited . But Steve , the caught bottle resting on his lap , did n't say anything . It was childish of me , but that was what I wanted from him . Feeling quite calm , I left . They let me get below the rocky outcrop before they hit me . I did n't know how there were so many of them . I had only seen two leave . But there were plenty . Three of them came at me from the side . I tagged onep246with a left hook right on the button that put him out of it all . Another I missed on his jaw , but caught him square in the Adam 's apple , which was just as good , and he fell down choking . The third ran right on past me and did n't turn or stop . By this time another had jumped on my back from behind . By now they were coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reached back for his shirt and flung him off over my head , and into two others who were running at me from the front . All three went down , but they all got right back up . By then two more were on my back from another direction behind me . I carried them out into the beaten-down parking lot where there was better footing , and managed to throw them off . I took two punches in the face doing it , and tagged one of the swingers with a right . Suddenly , without ever intending to , I yelled . A kind of combative bellow . And slugged somebody in front of me . I certainly did n't have to worry about hitting any friends . I was n't scared . I was having fun . The yell had just popped out of me . Actually I was enjoying myself . It seemed I 'd been waiting for this a long time . Then another lit on my back , and at the same time still another dove in with a football tackle and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to kick my feet loose , but the boy who had tackled me held my legs tight against his chest . I kept punching away with both hands , at anything that got in front of my face . I connected four times . I could hear muffled voices yelling , " Get him . Get him . Grab him . Hold him . " They were all in English , and they all had Americanaccents . In one of those moments of absolute quiet that come in a free-for-all like this one , I found that odd . And somehow strange . Somebody was cursing and booting me in the side . Betweenbodies I caught a glimpse of the scared , light faces of the Greek cab drivers all turned toward me , from wherep247they sat up on their coach boxes . Then something hit me in the side of the head and bells rang and colored lights exploded , and wheeled in the dark sky , and burned themselvesout and down to zero lighting in the black night like a dying pyrotechnic display . Very beautiful . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hairy face I saw . He was kneeling above me and gently slapping my face . " Let me alone , " I muttered . When I moved my jaw to speak , I could feel it was okay . So I added , " Ca n't a guy take a nap around here ? " " What happened ? " I ignored him and started doing a little assessing . There was a throb in my right temple , from a small knot just above the ear . My arms and legs seemed okay . My teeth were okay . My face felt puffy again , like that first night at Chantal 's , but there was only a tiny spot of blood . Lobo Davies , the Tsatsos Tackling Dummy . 6o drachs , step up and take your shot . I could charge admission . I had jammed my left thumb hooking . There was a sharp bite of pain in my left side every time I breathed . That would be from the kicking I remembered , before I went out . Wearily , I forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawked and spit on the ground . There was no blood in it . In all , I was in pretty good shape . They had n't cheststompedme afterward . Had n't kicked in my jaw . I felt a kind of liking for them . No maiming ; just good , clean old American fun . " The cab drivers said a gang beat you up . " I made myself roll over onto my hands and knees , trying not to wince from the bright pain in my side . I got one foot under me , then the other . Sonny stepped to help me . I waved him away.  | " Damn it , what happened ? " I pushed myself up , and a bright spotlight of pain in my side made me go lightheaded for a second and made my scalp tingle . If there was anything at all , I might have a cracked rib down there . But that was all . I was n't feeling the best I 'd ever felt . On the other hand I 'd taken a lot worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonny , and gave him my No. 4 , tough-butpitiablegrin . " Where did you come from ? " " I just got here . The cab drivers told me you were over here in the weeds . " " Ah , yes . The happy cab drivers . The grandstand seats . " I looked over at them . They were back on the ground , smoking . " Will you tell me what happened ? " " Nothing . A bunch of the hippie kids . It 's my own fault . I asked to see some guts and muscle , and I got shown some . If any of those boys are draft dodgers , it 's not through any lack of desire to fight . " " Draft resisters , " Sonny said . " There 's a difference . " " Have it your way , " I said . " Draft resisters . I 'm too tired to argue . " I forgot about my side , and took a weary , deep breath which made me jump and cut it off halfway in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against draft dodgers . I wish I 'd had the guts to be one myself . I just wish everybody in the world would be a draft dodger . Instead of only just Americans . Now leave me alone , " I said . " I 'm sort of tired . " " You do n't seem to be very upset by it all . " " I 'm just wondering if I should go back in there and have one drink , " I said . " I 'll go in with you , if you want , " Sonny offered . " You would , hunh ? You 're a regular fire-eater , are n't you ? " " Sure . I 've been beat up before , myself . " " Where 's all this peace and loving kindness of yours ?  | " A fist fight is not a dehumanized imperialist modern industrialwar , " Sonny said . I just looked at him . He had an infallible ability for ruiningthe nicest of gestures with some slogan . " That 's true , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to go back in there ? " Sonny said . " I guess not . " I looked up at the lights through the trees . " It would n't add anything . I got what I wanted . I guess I 'll go on home . " " Come on . I 'll take you . " He put out an arm . " You will like hell . " I waved the arm aside , and winced . " Where were you all evening ? " " I was home . To eat . I just came out . Jane , uh , " he half hesitated , " Jane did n't want to come . " " Jane . Dear Jane . How is dear Jane ? You go on up there with your friends . " His face clouded at my ironic mention of Jane , but he said only , " What shall I tell them ? " " Tell them whatever you want . Join the celebration . It wo n't bother me . " I turned away toward the cabs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 're not bad kids , " I said . " Most of them . Just misinformed by Stevie-boy . And I deliberately antagonized them . " " I guess you wo n't be wanting the boat tomorrow , " Sonny said . I grinned . " No . I guess I wo n't . " He stood looking after me reflectively . When I got to the stand of cabs I walked on past them . " Are n't you going to take a cab ? " Sonny called . " To hell with them . Anyway , the walk will do me good . " I hoped it would . But I was n't sure . At least it would loosen me up . But my side was hurting more and more . Every breath was an agony , as they say . Actually , it was n't all that bad . It hurt , but I had learned about pain that if you would only go down inside of it , and sort of rummage around down there , and feel it in all its corners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried not to feel it at all . It was about a mile 's walk back to the edge of the Port , and it was quiet and tranquil in the night air . The cooler night air had freshened whatever flowers there were bloomingand their odors mingled faintly in my nose . It was n't really all that late , only about ten o'clock . I had almost reached the end of the hotel grounds , and was passing under one of the infrequent streetlights , when there was a soft sound like a hard puff of air and a whack , and a piece of the whitewashed wall four feet from my head popped out and fell on the ground . It did n't take vast experience to know what that was . Someone was shooting at me with a silencer . Another puff , another smack , another piece of wall popped out almost beside the first and a little higher . I did n't wait . And did n't stand on dignity . I cut and ran . In the old days discretion might be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twentieth-century publicity was the better part of heroism . And I did n't have any PR people with me . There were two more puffs , two more pieces of wall popped out . I made a couple of zigzags . Wherever it was exactly , it was coming from inside the Xenia hotel grounds . I reached a corner and ducked around it . The gate entrances and doors were all barred or locked along here , but up the side street I found a deep-set one and flattened myself in it . Everything was still as I stood in my doorway . I saw no one . Nothing moved . The extreme corner of the Xenia gardenswith their dark vegetation just overlapped the entrance of the side street . I had about as much chance of finding somebody in there as you would in any other jungle . Even assuming I could get back down to it , in safety , which I could n't . In the dimness down below nothing moved . After fivep252minutes I took a chance and sneaked out of my doorway . I hotfooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my left arm against my side . Nothing happened . Nobody followed . There were n't any more shots . Up above , on one of the cross streets , I walked back to my house thoughtfully . I was pretty careful at all the crossings.  |p253As  far as I was concerned the shooting made it a whole new ball game . Four feet from the head at zo yards was pretty close for scare shooting . It implied something more was involvedthan I had yet figured out . Would Chuck have gone off and got a gun and come back to take a crack at me ? It was entirely possible . At the house the first thing I saw as I came in the upper garden door was the yacht Agoraphobe , all lit up again out in the little harbor as if she might be getting ready to go to sea again . I went on in and wearily climbed the stairs with the ice bucket to see what I had to repair . I examined myself in the bathroom mirror , then started methodically to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had gottengood at it over the years . My face was n't as badly marked as it felt . It would be nearly normal by tomorrow . The worst thing was the pain in my side but I could live with that . Anyway , I could n't do anything about it now . Maybe tomorrow I could get Georgina to help me tape it . That ought to titillate her . It was not yet eleven o'clock . Dmitri 's across the way was lit up and going full blast . With a drink in one hand and the icepack in the other I went to my bedroom and undressed to the skin and then turned off the lights . Then I stood in the window with my icepack to my face and watched the Agoraphobe . Whatever they were doing , they were n't getting ready for sea . As I watched , the lights began to go out andp254the generator motors were turned off . As I stood there , I heard Kirk hail them from the deck and one of the crewmenran down the ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I put down my icepack and got Con Taylor 's binoculars . I gave Jim Kirk a close looking at with them as the launch burbled back to the ship . I wanted to see if he had a gun on him . He did n't . Not one that I could see . Then I turned them on the crewman , and received a slight shock of recognition . I was looking at the smartest one of the three men who had jumped me outside Chantal 's house that night . The one who had called off the moronic-looking blond boy when he flashed his knife . I supposed I owed him a small debt of gratitude . I did n't feel like it . It had never occurred to me to look for my would-be muggers in Kirk 's crew . I swung the glasses back to the ship , and right away spotted the moronic blond boy in the crew on deck . The third man , the one whose nose I 'd smashed with my forehead , was n't among them . I put down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On board the yacht the rest of the lights went out , and I watched the crew pile into the launch and head for shore . Only Kirk and the blond boy stayed on board . I watched them go down the forward hatch to the crew 's quarters , where two lighted portholes stared back at me like eyes  --  the only lights left on the ship . With my icepack and my drink I sat down on the bed and sat there for a while , thinking . Down below the crew tied up the launch and dispersed . It was funny , but I had n't spotted a one of the three in town . I thought some more . After a while I got up and painfully began to dress . I did n't want to . I went downstairs and got out one of my snub-nosed .38s from my locked briefcase and put it inp255my belt under my shirt . Then I took the flexible flathead sap from the briefcase and put it in the hip pocket of my jeans . It was old-fashioned , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . It was more precise , and it did n't fracture as easily . One way or the other I meant to find out why those three had jumped me , and who had given the orders . If I found out something about the murder too , that was all to the good.  |p256There  was a lot of chatter and laughter and clinking of cutleryout in front at Dmitri 's and the jukebox blared some Greek song out over the water . Nobody paid the slightest attention to me . The dock was beyond the taverna 's circle of light . I untiedsomebody 's skiff , and sculled it standing , out past the gabbling terrace toward the quiet yacht . Every stroke of the oars built a new fire under my left arm . I did n't head for the ship 's ladder . It was strictly illegal , what I was doing . At the stern I grabbed hold of the springlineand stood in the skiff a while listening . Then I tied it and climbed stiffly but silently over the stern , trying not to grunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big deck house was wide open . I looked it over , then silently descended its set of ship 's stairs into the hold . I found myself in a long corridor running forward , with four cabin doors opening off either side . At the forwardend light shone through a curtained half-door . From beyond it came low voices . It was certainly my dream yacht , all right . I 'd have given just about anything to have been its master and owner . My forehead had broken out in a sweat from the pain of that climb over the stem . I did n't know what I expected to find . Certainly no million-dollar caches of heroin , even of hash . Not , anyway , without moving a lot of gear and floorboards and making a lot of noise . Up forward the low voices had n't stopped . The galleyp257was on my left and I looked it over with a pocket flash . Then I started forward through the cabins . The first one on the right was locked . I had looked into two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a voice behind me said , " All right , hold it . Just hold it right there . Do n't reach for anything . " It was Kirk 's voice . I put my hands up to my shoulders and turned around . Kirk stood at the foot of the stairs wearing a mean grin , a big Luger in his hand . " Stephanos ! " Behind me my moronic blond friend from the street fight appeared at the half-door . Kirk said something in Greek and the curtain dropped , and I heard feet scrambling up the ladder and running along the deck . " I told him to keep talking , " Kirk grinned . " Know how I cottoned to you ? I felt it . The balance of the boat changed . I did n't hear you . Yes , sir . " He looked pleased with himself . I walked along toward him . If I could get close enough . I wondered . My side was still hurting brightly from the climb over the stern . I was n't in my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Athens that there was some kind of an agent floating around Tsatsos , " Kirk said . The moronic blond boy had appeared behind him down the ship 's stairs . Kirk snorted . " That 's far enough . Let me just feel you up a little , Mr. Lobo Davies . " He patted me , found the pistol in my belt , stuffed it in his own belt , seemed about to quit , then felt behind me and found the sap . " Oho . A regular arsenal . You all ready to go to war , Mr. Lobo Davies . " He put the sap in his pocket and stepped back . " You look like somebody else has been using you for a punching bag too , " he grinned . Suddenly he stepped in , fast as hell , and slugged me on the jaw with a left hook . Ip258lit on my butt , my side screaming , and slid a few feet bowwardalong the corridor . I sat still , shaking my head to clear it . " You would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Get up , Mr. Lobo Davies . What happened to your face ? " I got up , using my left arm and side and turning to the left , although it hurt like hell . I did n't want him to know I was incapacitated there . " A bunch of your hippie clients tried to remodel it for me , " I said . It was the first I 'd spoken . " They 're not my clients . " He looked as if he was going to hit me again . Instead , he reached behind him with a key and unlocked the locked door I had tried earlier . " Let 's just step in here . This is my country . Stephanos ! " The blond moved around behind me . Kirk backed into the cabin , the Luger steady on me . There was n't much I could do . The blond boy pushed me roughly . The push made my side flare with hurt . The cabin was almost severely austere , and scrupulously clean . The only furniture in it besides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adornment was a lovely color photo of Agoraphobe under full sail and heeled over . Kirk put my gun and sap up on a little shelf behind him over the bunk , then pulled the little chair out to sit on . But the captain did n't sit on the chair just yet . As he straightened from pulling the chair against the outside wall , he extended the movement , turned it into a swing , and belted me on the side of the jaw again with his left hand . " Now , what are you doing on my ship ? " The blow was half strength but it knocked me into the corner of the bunk , even though I rode with it . My side sent me several wild signals of pain . I straightened up , shaking my head . The punch carried a value ratio of about ten of the hippie blows earlier.  | " I want to know whether you 're that agent I 've been hearing about , " Kirk said . " Are you ? " " I 'm a private detective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He belted me again in the same place . I sat down on the bunk . I knew if I was going to do anything at all , I was goingto have to do it soon . I clamped my teeth down on the pain from my side , holding it in and not letting it swerve me , and made myself get up . " I can hit a lot harder than that , " Kirk said with a flat mean grin . " And I can slap you around some with this , " he lifted the Luger . " That marks good . I can even shoot you , if I want . Nobody would ever know . Put a coat of chains on you and slip you over the side , they 'd never find you . Water'ssixty feet deep here , and nobody ever goes down in it . Harbor 's too dirty . And nobody knows you 're here . You did n't tell anybody you were coming . Now , say something . And say something important . " " I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my voice hard . " I do n't even think you 'll pistol-whip me . " " You do n't , hunh ? " Almost without lifting his hand , he hit me again , harder this time . I was knocked back into the corner , this time off my feet and onto the bunk . I sat up , shaking my head . My head was buzzing that sleepy buzz right behind the ears . Always a warning . The bright red and white flag of pain in my side was streaming in the wind again . But this time when I got on my feet , I was standing where I wanted to be . To the left and just a hair in back of the blond boy  --  who now was grinning all over his moronic , vicious face . " I can put this thing against your skin when I pull the trigger and nobody 'll ever hear it , " Kirk said . " I said , what are you doing on board my ship ? " " I came here because I recognized two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're two of the three guys who tried to beat me up the other night . I 'm not in the habit of letting people get away with that . I want to know why . "  | " You want to know why , hunh ? " Kirk snorted . This time he drew his fist back . Not much , but it was enough . In the cabin 's close quarters I slipped half a step to my right , grabbed the boy and shoved him at Kirk . The punch glanced off his shoulder . I pushed him harder , into Kirk . My side seemed to shriek out loud . But the two of them fell into a tangle onto the bunk , the Luger caught between their bodies . As they struggled , I booted the kid hard in the tailbone with my left foot , slammed my left knee into his back and stood on the knee , and reached my gun and sap down off the shelf above the bunk . I stepped back . " Let go of it , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As I spoke the boy got his feet under him and sprang back up , turning . The kick on the tailbone had hurt him bad , and there were tears of pain in his eyes . That made me feel fine . That made me feel excellent . As he turned at me , I rapped him sharply on his right wrist with the sap . He collapsed to the floor , nursing a paralyzedhand . Behind him the Luger thudded on the deck . I scooped it up , straightened and stuck it in my belt . From the floor the kid started at me again . This time I rapped him hard on the point of the left shoulder . He collapsedagain , with a paralyzed left arm . He sat holding his two arms in his lap . I had already sensed Kirk moving at me from the bunk . Tall or not , he loomed up like some kind of colossus . I stepped to meet him , and laid the barrel of my little .38 on him . He was anticipating the sap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hit him on the left side of his neck , just where the neck meets the skull . He sat down on the bunk , his eyes glazed , his mouth open and his tongue sticking out . " How does it feel ? " I said . " Thanks for not cutting me , " he said in a dulled voice . It would have knocked any other man unconscious.  | " Go screw , " I said . " You 're entirely welcome . " I stepped back to the wall behind me , and put my back on it . " You take a lot of chances , " Kirk said from the bunk . " Not really , " I said . " You were handicapped . You did n't want to shoot me . Even if you only cut me up with it , it would n't do your reputation any good . I 'd show it to Pe-. kouris . " " You think he would help you , hunh ? " Kirk said dully . I noted this little slip , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was deliberate . I tried to ease my left side by pushing my back against the wall with my legs . " Now , maybe we can talk a little , " I said . Dully , Kirk nodded slightly toward the blond boy . " I do n't like to talk too much front of him . " I looked at the boy . " He does n't understand English , does he ? " " He 's a wharf rat from Piraeus . You never know with them . He may have enough English to figure out what we 're saying . " " I 'll fix that for you , " I said crisply . " I 'll be pleased to . " I shifted the gun and sap and stepped to the boy and rapped him with surgical precision above the left ear . Horrible to Chantal , maybe . Or to Sonny Duval . But it was n't horrible to me . And it was n't to Kirk . The boy 's head dropped like a stone , without a sound . Kirk grinned dully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He wo n't even have a headache , " I said . " At least , not any worse than the one you gave me . " I shifted the gun and sap . " Now , where were we ? " " You were just saying maybe we could talk a little , " Kirk said . He rubbed his neck . " I think that 's a good idea . " I pushed my back against the wall again with my legs . My side was giving me real bloody hell . It was making my scalp tingle again . And Kirk 's face danced a little in front of me as I looked at him . " You know , somebody shot at me a while ago , " I said.  |p262He  only grinned . " They did ? Somebody must not like you , hunh ? " " I guess not . They seemed pretty serious about it . " I pulled his Luger out and sniffed it . It did n't smell strong , but it had been cleaned recently . With Hoppe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kirk said . " First , " I said , " I want to know who was behind your three lovable characters trying to knock me over the other night . " " I do n't mind answering that . That was Girgis . " " Blame the dead . Why have n't I seen any of them in the town ? " He grinned , and hitched himself up a little on the bunk . He was coming out of it . " I thought I 'd better give them a few days off . " " Where 's the third one ? " " He did n't come back . You gave him a pretty sore nose . They had to pull a lot of it back out of his eyes . " " Girgis wanted to scare me off of him , was that it ? " " That was the general idea . He asked me to do it . I did it for him as a favor . " " And he asked you to have your hard boys handle me . And you did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athens that same evening . Before I got jumped , Kirk . " " I stopped at the next port ten miles up the coast , and came back and picked them up . It 's an easy run back down here in the launch . " " And Girgis was killed the same night . It would have been easy to do both jobs on the same trip . Or even to make a second trip in the launch , alone , " I said . " It would have at that . But I did n't do that . Hell , I told you , Girgis and I were pals . " " He grinned . " I heard you were such good pals you might have wanted to take over that paying trade of his for him . " Kirk shook his head . " You did n't hear that . Who would have told you that ? It would n't have worked . I 'm not herep263enough . I do n't know any of these kids here the way Girgis did . You have to be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away enough to get all the stuff he wanted . So I started bringing it down from Athens for him . " I tried another tack . " Did it ever occur to you that the person or persons who knocked off Girgis may be trying to muscle in ? And that you might be on the list ? " He grinned benignly . " No . It did n't . And it still do n't . There 's nobody here that big . And there is n't that much money in hash . Nobody gives a damn . Nobody would risk a murder for it . " I could n't fault that . So I gave him the rest of it . " That 's the point . That 's a very good point . But there is also a little heroin involved , it seems . " " I do n't know anything about that , " Kirk said promptly . " If Girgis was selling H , I never heard about it . And I would n't touch it . Heroin is dangerous stuff nowadays . With all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked at me sanctimoniously . I did n't answer . Marie had explicitly said he was bringing in small amounts of H for those who had to have it . And more , that Girgis himself refused to touch it . " If Girgis was selling H , I do n't know anything about it , " Kirk said again . " What about this boss of yours ? " I said . " What 's his name ? Kronitis ? Is he in on this whole deal ? He owns the Polaris , too . " " Mr. Kronitis ? If he found I was in anything like selling hash , he 'd fire me like a shot . The same goes for Girgis . " There was a sudden fervency in his voice , that made it sound like the truth . I probed it further . " Kronitis must know about the hash you guys have been handling . " " For God 's sake , do n't go and tell him , " Kirk said . " You 'll have me out of a job . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy began to stir a little . He groaned . I looked down at him . My legs were beginning to tremble . Partly from holding my back so tight against the wall . " I guess I might as well be going , " I said . " His anesthetic seems to be wearing off . " I grinned at Kirk . " Unless you want me to put him to sleep again and talk more . " He did n't answer me . He just looked down at the boy , apparently lost in thought . Then he shook his head . " But get one thing straight , " I said . " I 'm no agent . I 'm a private detective . I 've been hired by a client to find out who killed Girgis Stourkos , and that 's what I 'm trying to do . I do n't give a damn about anything else . " " It 's easy enough to guess your rich client , " Kirk said with a leer . " Chantal von Anders 's been screwing Girgis for over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shook my head . " Wrong guess . Anyway , I never tell who my clients are . " " Well , I 'd like to find out who killed Girgis , too . I 'd like to help you . Why do you think I 'm talking to you ? " I wanted to laugh . But I was afraid of what it would do to my side . I was remembering when he had had the gun , and the drop , and the upper hand . Some help . " I ought to break your jaw with this , " I said , pulling the Luger out of my belt again . " I 'll leave it up on the wheel housing for you , instead . " I pushed the blond boy out of the way with my foot to get the door open . The movement sent a pain shooting through my side again . It suddenly occurred to me that if Kirk had wanted to talk longer , I could n't have done it anyway . I opened the door and looked back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Kirk said . He rubbed his neck . " You 're a tough hombre . You hurt my neck . " " What do you think you did to my jaw ? " I said . " No . No hard feelings , " I lied . I shut the door behind me . Up on deck I ejected the magazine from the Luger , andp265looked at it . It was full except for one . I drew back the elbow-type receiver , and a shell popped out onto the wheel housing . He had had it loaded , all right . I left the three objectson the housing . When I climbed down over the stern to the skiff , I thought I was n't going to make it . It was all I could do not to groan out loud . When I sculled the skiff back in , standing up , the lights of the taverna danced wildly in front of my eyes . I gritted my teeth and kept scuffing . After I tied the skiff , I walked quietly through the stillriotinglate drinkers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't be any good to Chantal or anybody else , this night . I had been beaten unconscious , rib-kicked , shot at and missed , then beaten nearly unconscious again on the jaw until I could hardly touch it , and then threatened with killing . I had certainly earned my pay from Kronitis today , even if I had n't found out anything significant . What else could happen to me ? What else could happen to me was that I could n't sleep . Whenever I moved the pain in my side woke me . My whole side was hot with fever when I touched it . I passed a fitful night , as they say in the newspapers about sick Presidents and other world leaders . Nobody came by and wrote it up.  |p266The  bad thing about injuries and bruises is they 're still there when you wake up the next morning . They do n't go away . I was barely able to crawl off the bed , in the morning . Shavingloosened me up a little . But my side made it almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some strong coffee and went down to the basement apartmentto Georgina . " Do you think you could help me tape up my side , " I said , " if I showed you how ? " " Why , of course . " She was delighted , in fact . " What 's wrong with it ? " " Just a bad sprain , " I said . " But it 's uncomfortable . " Con Taylor had all sorts and sizes of adhesive tape lying around . I chose a roll of 21/2 inch Johnson &; Johnson 's . I tore the strips off the roll for her , stuck them by their ends to the edge of the table , had her put the scissors beside them . " My God , you 're beat up , " Georgina said when I took off my shirt . She touched my shoulders . " You have a very manly torso , sir , " she said . " I 've never been up this close . " She loved every second of it . I stood in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower stalk , while Georgina buzzed and darted around me like a hummingbirdon a flight mission in a stand of hollyhocks . She tried to pump me about the fight , but I clammed up . Women always seem to love to help you , when you 've been hurt ; much more than when you 're unhurt . I think it gives them some kind of weird , secret sadistic sexual gratificationof some sort.  |p267I  kept up a running comment of instruction . " That 's it . No , start around further to the back . That 's it . A little lower . Now , pull it tight . Pull it as tight as you can . That 's it . Never mind about hurting me . Now , smooth it down . Never mind the loose end . We 'll cut them later . That 's it . Now , put the next one two-thirds up the first one , overlapping it . That 's it . Pull it tight . " I did n't know if she knew this particular bandage was the bandage for busted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell her . When we finished , I was trussed up my left side like some mummy . But I felt almost immediate relief . In the mirror I looked like some right-handed gladiator putting on his suit to go out in the ring . I put my shirt back on . I figured , with a little rest , I could get by like that and do almost anything I had to do . I certainly was n't about to give Kronitis back his retainer . I kissed Georgina on the forehead , thanked her and went back upstairs . About ten minutes later Pekouris roared up down below in the police jeep . He was alone this time . He wasted no time on preliminary ceremonies . " Is this what you call keeping your investigations quiet ? Getting in a public brawl with that gang of hippies ? " " I 'm sorry about that , " I said . " There was n't anything I could do . They jumped me . " I had already decided I would n't mention my set-to with Kirk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you provoked it so strongly no one but a saint could have avoided fighting you , " Pekourissaid coldly . " I guess there 's some truth in that , " I said after a moment . My unwillingness to leap in with irrefutable explanations seemed to set him back . He was too used to the European style , I guessed , which considered vehement counteraccusationthe best defense for everything . " Do you want to prefer charges ? "  | " No , " I said . " I would n't remember any of their faces . " " Against the hippie Steve ? Or the place ? " " It happened outside his place . No , " I said . " Unless , of course , you want me to prefer charges . " " I confess I do not understand you , Davies , " he said . " You are certainly not the Greek idea of what a police officer should be . " I felt like saying thank you . " I found out what I wanted , " I said . " Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy . " " I told you all that , " Pekouris said . " Before . I did it by deduction . You did not have to prove it .  --  " Well , I have some news for you in this department , Davies , " he said . " Some good , and some of it bad . " " Let me have the bad news first , " I said . " What did the laboratory say ? " " That is the good news . Our laboratory in Athens thinks it is highly probable that they can find and distinguish any human blood that might be on the machete mingled with goat 's blood . They are not sure they can determine the humanblood type , though , under those circumstances . " " That 's good news . Are you going to pick him up ? " " I would not have done that in any case , " Pekouris said disdainfully . " If they could not determine the blood type . But all this is an academic question now . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on the telephone twice with Athens this morning , " Pekouris said . " In addition to the laboratory . They are dropping the case . They have ordered me to close it out as unsolved and to send in the dossier . " He looked dismal suddenly , Pekouris . Not in any moral or idealistic way . But like a bloodhound who has suddenly been pulled away off a hot scent and put back on the leash . Like the bloodhound , his jaws appeared to ache . " Closing it out ! " I said . " But it 's only been three days ! What the hell ? "  | " There is no mystery about it , " Pekouris said . " Our main tourist season for the summer begins in ten days . They do not want to risk the bad publicity and the resulting cancellations . Our tourist season is very important to us . " I turned to stare at him . My belly began to tickle with wanting to laugh . I could n't help it , I began to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not at all , " he said stiffly . " I am the same thing as a soldier . I obey my orders . Theirs is not to reason why . Theirs is but to do , and die . " " I did n't see the movie , " I said . " But I read the book . " He only frowned . " In fact , I quite agree with them . Our national tourist season is much more important than the murder of some petty hashish smuggler . Right at this moment , a rumor is going out that it was not a person who was killed in the Xenia gardens at all , but a white hairless monkeyfrom South America which was somebody 's pet . And that the boy who found the headless body was confused . " " It 's you who is putting this out ? " I said . He simply blinked at me , and pressed his thick lips togethertightly . " It will confuse . It will inject an element of doubt . Right now , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people on Tsatsos will believe there was no murder . The other third would n't care anyway . " " Too bad Girgis 's so well known , " I said dryly . " Yes . But that ca n't be helped . " " I 'm being paid to find the killer , " I said . Pekouris leaned against the wall with folded arms . " I 've been ordered to tell you to stop your investigations . " I gave him a look . " You know I 'm not going to do that . " He nodded at me , " You have no choice . I already have been given the authority to put you on a plane and throw you right out of Greece , if you do not . To make sure , I am placing a telephone call to Mr. Kronitis this morning . " Officially ; officially , you are ordered to cease any action of yours having to do with this murder . "  | " I mean to . " " Well , this is a gas , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me enemies , Pekouris . " I pouched out my lips . The whole thing sounded like something out of Dick Tracy . That rumor , about a hairless South American monkey , that knocked me out . " Unofficially , " Pekouris said . He looked around for the housekeeper . " Unofficially , there is still one thing that might be done . Just between us two chickens . " " And what 's that ? " I thought I could guess . " If I can get hold of that machete , " he smiled . " Some way or other . If I can have it tested , and the tests come out right , there is a good chance I can cause the thing still to work . I think Athens would back me up , with evidence like that . But , naturally , I can not confiscate it , myself . " He suddenly looked like some Lebanese banker . " You 're asking me to steal it for you ? " " I am asking you nothing . I am not even offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  " " I know . You 'll deny it , " I said . " Hell , Pekouris , I ca n't do that . I 'm liable to get myself killed , if I go up in there again . The younger generation takes a very dim view of me . You saw what they did to me last night . " " I do n't mind admitting it would be a large feather in my cap in Athens , " he smiled . " I 'll bet . " " You would not get credit . But you would have the satisfaction of a job well done . " Before I could even jeer , he put his hands up and tilted his head on one side , like some character out of The Merchantof Venice . " But I 'm asking nothing . " " You 're appealing to my conscience ? You 're a bad judge of character . I 'm famous for not having any . " " No , but you want to keep on getting paid by Kronitis. "  | " Of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pause , " shenanigans . " I was forced to grin . " I 'm promising nothing , Pekouris , " I said . " No one is asking . " He pushed away from the wall and straightened his blue suit coat . " Just remember , any bit of notoriety attached to you , any word about you investigatingthose boys again or anybody else , just one bit , and  --  " He jerked his thumb in the direction of the sparkling horizon we could see through the open doors , out beyond the shaded porch , and the sun-faded little harbor . " I 'm expecting to go to Athens in a couple of days . On business . For quite some time . " " I see , " I said . " Anything that happens must happen before then . " I walked out on the porch to watch him drive away another time . Portly , heavy-shouldered , an excellent eater , Pekouris . He sat his jeep like it was some old-time charger , and herded it down the road the same way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his certain measure of power , did Pekouris . And he would use it without scruple when he could . He was willing to swallow it down humbly when he could n't . He was the personification and spit and image of my picture acquired over 50 years of what the whole human race stood for and was worth . It was a pretty dismal image to put up against 5o years . If you could n't laugh at it , you would want to go away and shoot yourself . I sat down and called Chantal . My mind was a complete blank . I had no plans toward any scheme . And I was n't goingto work up any for Pekouris . Morning was the only time to be sure of getting Chantal , and she was in . But she had a lunch date , a date to play bridge in the afternoon , and a dinner for the evening . " I did n't get up there last night , " I said.  | " I know all about it . You got yourself into another fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of children . " I was a little stung . " They did n't hit and kick like children , " I said mildly . " Anyway , I did n't come . " " You were too bruised and wounded . I know . Nobody 's talking about anything else . I 've had five phone calls . They 're all delighted to call me . My new boyfriend . And out fighting with children . " " Lay off it about children , " I said sharply . There was a slightly startled pause ; I can make my voice quite sharp . " I wanted to come . And while we 're on it , I 'm getting tired of seeing you only late at night , after your social evenings , like some hired stud . Lobo Davies Stud Service . Available At All Hours . Satisfaction Guaranteed . " That slowed her down a little . " That 's a nasty thing to say . But then you never were noted for your manners . " I would n't answer that . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said in a less bitchy tone . " No , " I said . " But I 'm not coming up to your house for just a little late sex after the servants are sent off . You want to see me , you can have a date with me . " " I can arrange it for you to come to this dinner party . Very easily . But you do n't like my dinner parties . " " No . I do n't . That 's not good enough . " " Well , do you want me to meet you somewhere after ? " " I 'll meet you at Georgio 's , " I said . " The one you call the dancing taverna . That 's near where you 'll be . " There was a pause . " All right , " she said . Another pause . " But you had better be there when I get there . I 'm not goingto go in and sit at a table alone , there , and wait for you . " " Whatever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the times , and hung up . I went across and lay down on one of the couches in front of the fireplace . I did n't know if I was up to meeting anybody anywhere . Thep273constant hot scream in my side was gone . But it was replaced by a vast monstrous toothache down there , with roots all the way down to my crotch . I had not been down long enough to doze , when the phone rang . I got up stiffly and went over to answer it . It was Kronitis . Pekouris had called him , all right . But first I had to go through the long and dismal formalitiesthe old man seemed to dote on . First , I had the male secretary , who meticulously checked if I was me . Then the old man himself , with all his how-are-your . " What do you think you ought to do ? " he asked me finally . It sounded very cautious . " Well , " I said irritably , " it would seem to me that when the police are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . Assuming you want the murder solved . But I 'll do whatever you instruct me . I can return your retainer tomor-row . " " No , no . No , no . That retainer is yours . That was the way I made the arrangement . " A pause . " As for the rest , I guess I had better just leave it up to you .  --  " But Pekouris said he would throw you out of Greece if you did n't stop your investigations . I would n't like that to happen . Nor would Freddy Tarkoff . " " I 'd like to keep on nosing around , " I said . " For a few days . If that 's all right with you . " " You do n't think it would be better to just give up the whole thing ? " Again , it sounded excessively cautious . " Only if you say so . " " Very well . I 'll authorize that , " he said . " What you said . It 's whatever you think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself shot at last night , " I said . There was a sharp intake of breath at the other end . " You mean , with a gun ? " " Yes , sir , " I said . " With a real gun . " " Is n't that awfully , uh , professional ? "  | " I do n't know , " I said . " They missed me . You would n't have any ideas on that , would you , Mr. Kronitis ? " " No . " A pause . " No , I certainly would n't . " We went through a long and excessively courteous formalityof saying goodbye which could have been done in two words . I lay back down on the couch . Finally I was able to doze , after a couple of stiff Scotches . I ate the old woman 's lousy cooking for lunch again , and hobbled around the house most of the afternoon . My side hurt too much to read with any pleasure . I slept a little . For dinner I ate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have any other kind of meat . My teeth and jaws were beginning to hunger after a good thick sirloin . American-style . At eleven I caught a horsecab in front of the taverna to take me up the hill and across the point to Georgio's.  |p275I  had n't been back there since the night I 'd accosted Girgis outside . The place did n't seem to remember me . It did n't remember Girgis , either . The huge jukebox still blared the same Greek songs interspersed with foxtrots . There were a lot of the Greek tourists . After a little , you learned to recognize them . I took a table where I could watch the door for Chantal . I had to admit she was a beauty , when she came in . Her shortish hair looked just right for a hot summer night . And she always had that look of class . She was dressed ingeniouslyin an outfit that did not look out of place at Georgio 's , and at the same time would look right at home at the Danish count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with clothes on , you could never have told her age . I saw her before she saw me . My table happened to be camouflaged from her . So I watched her change her roles at the door . It was like watching an actress shake herself and change her personality before stepping on stage . From a hardeyed , suspicious , acquisitive European woman , totally selfconcerned , she became a youngish , carefree , flighty , rich man 's plaything , too cheerful and spoiled to remember her last bank-account balance . I got to my feet . She had been so openly hostile and angry the several times on the phone that I had forgotten the feeling of devi/ousness she always gave me when she was in front of me in the flesh . " This is n't the place I would have picked , but it does n't matter . " She gave me a cute grin . " It 's good to see you any way at all . " She was a little high . I got my drink and we moved to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over the outdoor patio and the sea beyond . The moon made a twinkling ladder at us off the water . " I 'm drinking cognac , " Chantal said . I ordered two . " I 've got a few items of news for you . Then I 've got a couple of things I want to talk to you about , " I said . She was looking around the place . She seemed hardly to have heard me . " I did n't know you had taken up the Greek dancing ? " I shrugged . It made me wince involuntarily . " Oh . You 're really hurt . " " Nothing that wo n't heal overnight , " I said . She looked at me with large eyes . " You 're so stupid , really . They all say you were knocked completely unconscious . I made a face . " What is hurt ? " " My back , " I lied . " I sprained it . " " Must we go through all this dating routine , before I can get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " I suppose we must . The male vanity must be appeased . " " It 's good to see you outside your bastion once in a while , " I said . " I was beginning to forget what you looked like with clothes on . " She was smiling . " Oh ! You really are the bastard . Are n't you ? " " If you say so . " " And that 's what women love about you ; and you knowp277it ; and you play it ; Lobo Davies , the lovable bastard . What 's all this news you have ? " I looked out at the yellow moon path . " Would you like to take a walk outside first ? " " If you like . " She got up . I followed her . The waiter arrived just then with the cognacs . I motioned him to leave them . Outside we walked back and forth on the stone patio . It was a little cooler out there , but not much . When I turned to her , she reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself not to wince when she squeezed me . But she drew back . " What 's this ? What 's that on your side ? " " Adhesive tape . For the back . It 's nothing . " " Oh , you really are such a fool . I 'm not even going to ask you why you were up there . Or what you did , to have a fight . " This time she put her arms around me carefully , and did n't squeeze . I kissed her . She felt good , and natural , undermy hands ; as if it was on a woman her age that my hands belonged . But I could n't forget that first look on her face back there at the door . " Oh , that 's good ! " she said when I let her go . " Come on , let 's go back inside . I want my cognac . " As we walked back to the steps , I looked down at the waterand saw something floating in the edge of the moon path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly against the sand . I stopped , but my side was hurting too much to bother going to look at it . Anyway , I was n't doing any driftwood sculpture this year . I followed Chantal in . She grabbed her glass . " What 's all this news , now ? " " Well , first , I 've been hired by someone , to find Girgis 's killer . And for a goodly sum . " " Oh , really ? " She kept on looking at me . She did n't seem so surprised . " Who might that be ? " I had a sudden , weird hunch that she already knew . " You 'd never guess in a million years . " " I might . " She looked at me speculatively . She seemed top278be deciding whether to make her guess . The only one who could have told her was Kronitis . He was the only one who knew , besides Pekouris . She dropped her eyes . " No , I guess I could n't guess . " " Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would guess it , " she said without raising her eyes . I chalked up one for my side . " The second thing , that I found out , " I said , " is that Jim Kirk has been pushing a little H on Tsatsos . " " Jim Kirk ? " She looked up , and her eyes had that startleddeerlook I 'd seen them get before at the mention of Kirk . I chalked up another one . " You mean the captain of the Agoraphobe ? " " The very same , " I said mildly . " I wonder if old Mr. Kronitis knows about that ? " " I have no idea , " Chantal said . " I would n't think so . I would think he 'd fire Kirk right away . " She looked away from me , outdoors . " Is n't the moon path lovely ? " " Did you know that old Ambassador Pierson is an H addict ? " I said . She looked back at me crossly . " You really are a nosy bastard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " That 's what people pay me for , " I said . " Well do n't be proud of it . Nobody 's paying you to check up on poor old Ambassador Pierson . " " I have n't told anybody but you , " I said . " And you already knew . " She jerked her shoulders at me , as if something had pricked her in the back . " All right ! I did it as a favor to Kirk . He asked me because he knew about the hashish and Girgis . I also did it as a favor for the old Ambassador . But I did n't get a penny for doing it ! " " That does n't make any difference in the eyes of the law . " " And I know all that , too . I 'd still do it again ! "  | " How long have you known about the old Ambassador ? " " Oh . Oh , a long long time . Everybody I know on the islandknows about it . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That , I do n't know . Maybe the old gentleman went to him . " I did n't try to refute that , but it would n't hold water . If Pierson went to Kirk himself , Kirk would n't need Chantal as a carrier . I said nothing . " Sources for heroin have been drying up in Europe lately , with the Americans running all over , " Chantal said . " I guess the old gentleman was having trouble getting it through his regular channels . " " It interests me how Kirk gets it so easy . " Again she got that still , startled-deer look . " Kirk apparentlyhas all sorts of avenues for all sorts of things in Athens . And I 'm sure Leonid Kronitis does n't know about any of it . " " I 'm sure he does n't . Was that the , quote , further secret , unquote , that you 've been holding back on me all this time ? " She looked at me as if she did n't understand me .
