When the workers ' riots erupted in Poland , some of the loudest denunciations of the Communist bosses in Warsaw came from party spokesmen in Western Europe-most notably from the Red leaders of Italy 's Emilia-Romagna region . Guido Fanti , the Communist president of the region , rose before his 50-member council to deplore " the tragic events of Poland . " The Communist mayor of Bologna , Renato Zangheri , expressed " the strongest condemnation of the use of arms " to suppress the revolt . <P> It was , in a way , no great surprise that the Italian Communists should be so quick to criticize the errors of their Polish comrades ; they are a rather special breed . Emilia-Romagna is one of 15 Italian regions that last June elected semiautonomous governments under a nationwide decentralization program - and the only one in which the Communists and their allies won a majority . Rather than use their new-found power to try to cast the region along orthodox Marxist lines , the Emilia-Romagna Communists-who have been the dominant political force in the so-called " red belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it a showcase for good government . Keeping a very low profile indeed , the Communists seem shrewdly determined to prove that all of Italy , and not just Emilia-Romagna , would be better off Red than almost anything else . <P> In building their showcase , the Communists skillfully capitalized on the region 's natural advantages . Emilia-Romagna has long been Italy 's richest agricultural region . For the past 20 years , it has led the nation in industrial growth ; thanks to an influx of new plants and fat payrolls , the per capita income in Bologna ( more than $1,600 a year ) is rising at a rate of better than 9% a year . Businessmen find that it is one place where they can count on local Communist politicians to keep obstreperous left-wing labor unions in line . <P> Party officials not only court industrialists , but also the ordinary citizen - in refreshing contrast to the usual Italian practice . For small businessmen , the Communists have slashed bureaucratic red tape . For farmers , they have set up cooperatives that take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which includes 80% of the world 's supply of Parmesan cheese . New arrivals from the poverty-stricken south always find a party representative on hand at the railroad station or bus depot to point the way to a job , to housing or to party-run community centers with cut-rate bars and restaurants . Many of Italy 's beaches are open sewers , but in Rimini , on Emilia-Romagna 's Adriatic coast , swimmers enjoy waters kept clean by modern antipollution equipment . <P> The results of Communist rule are not all on the plus side . Personal corruption of minor officials is less obtrusive than in other regions , but the party and its faithful have won themselves positions of high privilege-and profit . Much of the profit from the hundreds of Communist-run stores , building firms and other cooperatives in the region 's eight provinces flows first into the coffers of the party and its myriad youth groups , women 's auxiliaries and other fronts , and then into the pockets of the legions of hacks and functionless functionaries on party payrolls.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
