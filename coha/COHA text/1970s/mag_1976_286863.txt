The People and the Power <P> by ROBERT G. KAISER 499 pages . Atheneum. $12.95 . <P> THE RUSSIANS <P> by HEDRICK SMITH 527 pages . Quadrangle. $1 2.50 . <P> <P> The American view of Russia has been refracted over the last half-century through layers of repugnance , infatuation , loathing , horror , suspicion , complacency-and now , in doubts about dtente , by suspicion again . It has run a course from Lincoln Steffens ' fatuous " I have been over into the future , and it works " to the nightmares of John Foster Dulles . In imagining Russia , Americans have always had a tendency to project their own illusions upon a wall of blank ignorance . <P> Falling Bricks . The ignorance is understandable : the Soviet Union keeps itself as difficult to read as a Five Year Plan . Partly for that reason , the American curiosity persists , especially in the ambiguous atmosphere of Soyuz-Apollo , grain deals , Angola and the apocalyptic visions of Alexander Solzhenitsyn in exile . Also involved , of course , is the fascination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a measure of that interest that Hedrick Smith 's The Russians has climbed almost instantly onto the bestseller list . By rights , it should be sharing the distinction with Robert Kaiser 's Russia . Smith 's work is more rigorously organized , richer in anecdote ; Kaiser 's a bit broader , more discursive , and given to larger generalization . Both books , superb exercises in political-travel journalism , give Russia what it has always lacked for Americans : a complicated human reality . <P> Smith and Kaiser served identical tours in Russia from 1971 to 1974 - Smith as Moscow bureau chief for the New York Times , Kaiser as bureau chief for the Washington Post . Both were relegated to Moscow 's ghetto for the foreign press . Necessarily , their accounts overlap ; they frequently describe the same events-the two were the first foreign newsmen to interview Solzhenitsyn , for example-and even the same routines by Comedian Arkadi Raikin . <P> Both authors agree that the Soviet system works-miserably . Russia , writes Kaiser , is a superpower that lacks even a basic network of good roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authoritarian system in concentrating vast resources upon narrow goals-defense and space , for example-but otherwise have built an economy that is preposterously inefficient and corrupt . Industrial plant directors bent upon fulfilling the Plan adulterate their products to increase quantity . Pills come out at half-strength . A canning engineer admits : " If we add less sugar to the jam , we can produce more canned goods and meet the Plan . " Window panes are often made so thin that most are shattered before they can be installed in apartment complexes that begin losing bricks just after the tenants move in . ( Jutting screens are sometimes installed above the first floor to catch the falling bricks. )
