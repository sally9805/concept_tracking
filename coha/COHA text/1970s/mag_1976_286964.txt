WHAT SHALL WE WEAR TO THIS PARTY ? by SLOAN WILSON 442 pages . Arbor House . $12.95 . <P> <P> Sloan Wilson reports in these amiable memoirs that in 1955 , after the vast sales of his novel The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit , tailors sought him out and begged him to accept , gratis , suits of fine gray flannel . Wilson 's book had already confirmed what everybody knew-that the gray flannel suit had become the uniform of some sort of success in a tall building in New York . Wilson felt that to wear one would be to indulge in ridiculous self-advertisement . It says something about the careful , rather unimaginative Wilson , as well as about the doleful plumage of the period , that when he finally did pick a free suit , his liberated choice was brown flannel . <P> A reader today finds it hard to see what seized the imagination of the country in Wilson 's earnest novel of postwar listlessness . The prose is bland . The plot devices are those of what used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fathering an illegitimate child in Italy during World War II ? Yes . Will a dishonest caretaker succeed in cheating Tom and Betsy out of an inheritance ? No . <P> The novel does ask a better question , though . Tom , who has fought a hard war , now rides a commuter train and works at a corporate job . Should n't there be something more to life , he wonders dimly , than crawling up the salary ladder , moving from suburb to classier suburb ? If the process by which a novel becomes a bestseller is not simply a random phenomenon , like the winning of a lottery-a dubious proposition that wise old publishers brood about-then Gray Flannel owed its vogue to the fact that a lot of sad young men were thinking the way Tom was . Presumably they must have liked the novel 's reassuring answer , which is , more or less , cherish your wife , vote yes on school bond issues , and existential despair will stay away from your door . <P> At 55 , Wilson is more interesting than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his windfall novel . He was born into an Eastern family of faded affluence , whose wealth was more attitude than actuality . There was sufficient reality , however , that young Wilson could learn seamanship aboard the family yacht . When the U.S entered World War II , he won a quick commission in the Coast Guard , and served eventually as commanding officer of a converted trawler assigned to the dangerous Greenland patrol . He learned to be a good skipper under the contemptuous eye of a great skipper , and one of his lessons was that he must make do with ability that stopped short of brilliance . <P> The hundred or so pages that take Wilson through his Coast Guard years would make a fine short sea novel . The writing , in general , is dogged , honest and unbrilliant , and to chronicle the Greenland patrol , those qualities are sufficient . The sea supplies the power and depth missing in his dry-land work , just as similar sagas of water and war have served other journeymen writers well .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
