THE DEEP <P> Directed by PETER YATES Screenplay by PETER BENCHLEY and TRACY KEENAN WYNN <P> The Deep isn't-very deep , that is . <P> It does have , however , a very pretty lady ( Jacqueline Bisset ) who can be observed scantily , or at least wetly and therefore clingingly , clad on every possible occasion . There is also some pretty underwater photography and some pretty fair suspense as good guys and bad guys thrash around on the ocean bottom looking for long-lost treasure of the Spanish Main , which is all mixed up with some more recently misplaced valuables - morphine that the wicked ones want to turn into heroin . <P> The story also has some pretty serious problems , or , perhaps more accurately , some puzzling aspects for what is intended as summer-weight entertainment . The most curious of these is a certain unconscious-or is it semiconscious ? - racism . The crowd pursuing the almost-heroin is composed entirely of black men , and their interest in sexually tormenting Ms. Bisset is at least as powerful as their greed for the drug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend a quiet week in Bermuda with her boy friend . Out scuba-diving , they discover tantalizing clues to both treasures . Very soon she is being forced to strip in front of the assembled baddies , though she could not possibly conceal the object they seek -a large medallion-on her pretty person . A little later they invade her room dressed in voodoo getups , smear her body with blood and seem to do something rather peculiar with a chicken claw they 're carrying . The sadism is excessive for this context , and the employment of blacks in the roles of sex fiends caters to an ugly racial stereotype that should have died with D.W. Griffith . <P> Beyond that , there are the Nick Nolte and the Robert Shaw problems to deal with . The former , playing Bisset 's lover , is one of those sun-kissed California lads , very cool and laid-back in the current West Coast fashion among males . He made his mark in TV 's Rich Man , Poor Man , and there is obviously a feeling abroad that he can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible , but this script makes Nolte seem a rather sullen whelp . <P> If he has any of Redford 's natural ease , he is unable to force it up between the thick lines he has to speak here . <P> Wearying Ebullience . As for Shaw - what are we to do with him ? He ap pears to be a congenitally ebullient fel low , willing to do anything to perk up a dull scene . Here he plays the local expert on treasure hunting , full of unexplained but noisy eccentricities , which he cheerfully stresses in a variety of accents and many a broad gesture . He provides energy in what would otherwise be purely expository scenes , but he is rather hard on any scenery or actors who happen to get in his way . Over a long haul , he is also wearying - like a drunk at a party who refuses to shut up .
