Hollywood usually gets its bearings from the weather vane rather than the compass . Since the wind has been blowing chilly from Indochina , a new movie or two have gingerly and unconvincingly suggested that America 's flaws are innate rapacity and violence . <P> One such is Cold Turkey , an extended sitcom loaded with the kind of jokes that induce canned laughter . Like the Mock Turtle , Writer-Director Norman Lear attempts an arithmetic composed of Ambition , Distraction , Uglification and Derision . A tobacco tycoon ( the late Edward Everett Horton ) offers $25 million to any American city whose inhabitants can quit smoking for 30 days , on the plausible theory that it can not be done . But he reckons without the Rev. Clayton Brooks ( Dick Van Dyke ) . Led by the uptight , upright preacher , Eagle Rock , Iowa , turns abolitionist . In the process , it writhes with collective withdrawal symptoms familiar to anyone who has tried to kick the habit . Such civil strife is grossly overdone , and the refinement of Lear 's touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town a share in the defense budget : a large bull is shown in the foreground . <P> As Cold Turkey clucks along , it does prove fitfully amusing .

" But these benign entertainers are essentially aural comedians , and their limitations underline the show 's . Many films have been written specifically for TV . Cold Turkey seems the first to have been made for radio .
