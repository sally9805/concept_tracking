Even in the age of chronic protest , few Americans know the rules for public demonstrations . It is not surprising . The First Amendment firmly guarantees every person the right to speak freely , assemble peaceably and petition the Government for redress of grievances . Yet there is no constitutional right to express dissent at any particular time or place . State or municipal governments are free to restrict almost any public speech or conduct that clearly threatens to incite violence or impede some of society 's other legitimate interests . <P> As a result , U.S. laws and customs dealing with demonstrations abound with local variations , many of which are probably unconstitutional but have not yet been tested in the courts . In South Carolina and several other states , anyone who hangs the flag upside down faces a jail term . Pennsylvania permits flag desecration as a form of political expression . In Athens , Ga. , white demonstrators can get parade permits in six hours ; blacks wait 24 hours . No appellate court has yet tested the constitutionality of the 1968 federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine for crossing a state line to incite or join a demonstration that might turn violent , even if it never takes place . <P> All the same , the Supreme Court and many lower courts are gradually developing fair rules that apply equally to hardhats and longhairs . Among the more clearly settled patterns : <P> STREET-CORNER SPEECHES for political or religious purposes require no permits , even if a crowd is likely to gather . One rarely enforced New York City ordinance requires speakers to display an American flag . The general rule holds that strong , even abusive language is permitted , but incitement that might set off violence is not . The line between the two is still being worked out in the courts . <P> LEAFLET DISTRIBUTION is not littering as long as it is done on public streets for political purposes . Even so , recipients can be fined or arrested for discarding leaflets carelessly . <P> SIDEWALK MARCHES AND PICKETING are constitutionally protected from most interference by public officials , although several cities demand permits and Illinois law bars picketing in front of private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privately owned thoroughfares that are used regularly by the public , such as the paths and parking lots of shopping centers . Peaceful participants can march as far as they like , stretch out the line of march , chant , and even subject pedestrians to minor inconveniences without being penalized . Pickets who remain standing instead of walking can not be arrested for refusing to obey police orders to keep moving , unless the police have reason to believe that the demonstrators are blocking traffic or preventing pedestrians from normal movement . <P> STREET PARADES require permits virtually everywhere , as do activities in most parks and the use of sound equipment . Though permission may not be denied arbitrarily , standards of reasonableness are still in flux . Chicago reacted to the 1968 Democratic Convention riots by enacting a new law requiring the city to grant or deny permits within two days after applications are filed . The New York Civil Liberties Union wryly advises : " It may be well to apply for such a permit . If you do n't get it , you will then have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
