Founders call it " Womansurge . " Opponents dismiss it as " Womanpurge . " By any name , the new group , which says it will go into action this week , means more factionalism within the feminist movement and threatens to turn the National Organization for Women ( NOW ) into Then . <P> Feminist-Author Betty Friedan , 54 , co-founder of NOW in 1966 , and a dozen of its officials and ex-officials formed Womansurge at a secret eight-hour meeting two weeks ago in a New Orleans airport-motel room . The strategy : to counter what they see as the ruinously revolutionary drift of the present NOW leadership , including President Karen DeCrow , 37 , a Syracuse lawyer who narrowly won re-election in October on the slogan OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM AND INTO THE REVOLUTION . Argues Brandeis Professor Mordeca Jane Pollock , 34 , one of the moderate dissidents : " If you have any political sense , you do n't talk about revolution in America today . We 've grown up . Look at Eldridge Cleaver . " <P> Though the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will mean a return to the gung-ho exhortations and disruptions of 1960s ' militants . Toni Carabillo , 49 , a NOW official from Los Angeles , told TIME that the group will go in for sit-ins and interruptions of congressional hearings . " Our pattern of professional lobbying has slowed us down , and we 'll go back to the former techniques . " NOW is also expected to become more explicitly political by endorsing and opposing candidates for public office . <P> Last Gasp . The DeCrow group , which took 25 of 34 NOW offices in the October elections , regards Womansurge as a splinter faction of aging professional women willing to accept token advances and avoid new issues . " It 's the last gasp of a very small group with a condescending view of what feminism is like , " says DeCrow . " If you mention you want to change the behavior of men or if you mention gay rights , they 're frightened away . " <P> Womansurge counters that NOW is overstressing lesbian rights and alienating housewives with firebrand oratory , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : more jobs for women , day care , legal protection and help with marriage and divorce problems . Says Friedan : " A lot of women dropped out because NOW was no longer speaking for them . The sexual preoccupations and radical rhetoric seemed to take over . " Like many other feminists , she believes that a housewives ' revolt against narrow , strident feminism produced the recent stunning defeats of state equal rights amendments in New York and New Jersey ( TIME , Nov. 17 ) . <P> The NOW-Womansurge warfare comes at a time when much of feminism 's early momentum is gone . Though Womansurge is planning a national conference of feminists to take stock of the movement , it has no plans to become a membership organization rivaling NOW . But , says Wendy Winkler of the New Orleans 13 , " if the leadership of NOW is so alienated from its members that there is no place to go , we may become a viable alternative to NOW . I 'm hoping it does n't happen . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
