SEX BEHIND THE BAMBOO CURTAIN In the People 's Republic of China women wear no cosmetics , no perfume , no jewelry , no lace underwear , chiffon nightgowns , tight-fitting sweaters , sheer blouses , or short skirts . These are considered " fancy articles designed to entice males . " But the girls manage , just the same . By Ann Landers I traveled 25,000 miles to learn first  --  hand about sex  --  premarital , marital , and extramarital  --  in the People 's Republic of China . On my first full day in Peking , I visited with David Bruce on what turned out to be his last day in that city as Liaison Offi  --  cer for the United States . He told me in the privacy of his gracious residence on Kung Hua Road , " If you dig up any infor  --  mation on that subject , you will be the first . I 've talked with dozens of journalists and other visitors to the People 's Republic and not one has been able to scratch the surface . Sex is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear lady . " Mr. Bruce was right . Good luck was what I needed  --  and I was shot full of it . First , to have been invited by the Ameri  --  can Medical Association as an official member of their sixteen-person delega  --  tion . Then to have met Mrs. Edgar P. Snow just a few weeks before my depar  --  ture ! Add to that the unmitigated chutz  --  pah to ask some outrageously intimate questions of physicians , nurses , interpret  --  ers , guides , waitresses , teachers  --  everyone and anyone who would speak to me . Of course , I received some dirty looks in the process , but I also got some incredibly frank answers . I talked to a man who told me his wife had a thermometer on the bedroom wall , and when it registered 26.7 centigrade , which is 80 degrees Fahrenheit , no sex . Too hot . A thirty-three-year-old waitress whose husband has been sent to the coun  --  tryside for a year said she was too tired to miss sex , although she did miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A male interpreter told me that he and his wife had " different sexual appetites , " but that she was what you might call a very good sport . As the first American journalist to be admitted to Mainland China in over a year , I felt an obligation to bring back a story . That inordinate privilege gave me courage to barrel ahead in shameless pur  --  suit of information considered delicate in our country , to say nothing of how it might be viewed in a foreign land . When I arrived in Peking , some doors , previously described as " impenetrable , " had already been opened by Mrs. Snow . One of those doors belonged to Dr. George Hatem , the most beloved Ameri  --  can in this vast land of 800 million Chi  --  nese . Dr. Hatem , affectionately called Dr. Ma Hai-Teh ( which means Virtuous One From Overseas ) , was born in Buffalo , New York in 1911 of Lebanese parents . He was educated in Greenville , South Caro  --  lina , and medically trained in Beirut and Geneva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1933 , he decided to spend a year in China studying tropical medicine before returning to the States to practice . " I knew they had many challenging tropical diseases there , " he said , " and I was sure to get plenty of experience . " With a smile that virtually illuminated the huge dining room of the Peking Hotel , Dr. Hatem continued to tell his story . " Once I reached Shanghai , I realized that nowhere in the world was there a more desperate need for doctors . So I stayed . " Dr. Hatem is unquestionably one of China 's most knowledgeable authorities on sex , and soon I learned why . In 1935 , after this young man from North Carolina cast his lot with Mao 's forces against the invading Japanese , he was assigned to spearhead the campaign to eradicate vene  --  real disease . " At first , I felt overwhelmed and depressed . It seemed utterly hope  --  less , " he confessed . " There were over 100,000 prostitutes in Shanghai alone , and about 95 percent of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was close down the brothels . " I sat spellbound as Dr. Hatem described the public meetings , house-to-house case-finding , and the rehabilitation of the street women . " We worked night and day , training thousands of teams of barefoot doctors . Their double mission was to teach and to cure . " ( Barefoot doctors , incidentally , are neither barefoot nor are they doctors . They are the sons and daughters of peasants , some with as little as three months of medical training . To  --  day they number 1.2 million . ) The clincher was Dr. Hatem 's statement that he would welcome a medical team from any country to visit any major city in China and test a million people at ran  --  dom . " I would be very surprised , " he said , " if they found more than a handful of V.D. cases . " Was Dr. Hatem feeding me the Party Line ? Was I being " taken in " ? At first , I was suspicious , but the longer I listened , the more I believed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of read  --  ing between the lines of the millions of letters to Ann Landers , I had at least learned to spot the phonies . This man , I concluded , after some moments of reflec  --  tion , was for real . When I returned to the States , I phoned three of my consultants in the field of dermatology and asked if Dr. Hatem 's story sounded plausible . Two of the physicians said , " I believe he was telling you the truth , but , " they pointed out , " in a totalitarian setup , you can do things you ca n't do in a democracy . " The third der  --  matologist said , " I think he overstated his case . I 'd love to accept his offer . " When I glanced at my watch and no  --  ticed forty minutes had passed , I opted to go for the jugular . " Is it true , Dr. Hatem , " I asked , " that there is no premarital sex in the People 's Republic of China ? We Amer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it difficult to believe . " Dr. Hatem planted his spoon firmly in his bowl of yogurt , looked at me with eyes like hypodermic needles and replied , " In a country of 800 million people , it would be ridiculous to say there is no this or no that . Of course , we have some pre  --  marital sex here , but I can tell you there is very little . " The ninety minutes that followed were devoted almost exclusively to that sub  --  ject . Dr. Hatem explained the early and intensive indoctrination of the children , the high priority China places on her young people ( " our greatest asset , " he called them ) . Chairman Mao 's program stresses char  --  acter-building , and dedication to the System , " Dr. Hatem went on . " Another vital factor in teenage behavior is accep  --  tance by one 's peers . Intercourse before marriage is looked upon as highly immor  --  al  --  a disgrace . A premarital pregnancy is viewed as a shameful departure from one 's early teaching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tinued , " that approximately 60 percent of China 's inhabitants are under thirty years of age . This means 480 million Chinese were under five years of age , or not yet born , when Chairman Mao came to full power . " Dr. Hatem 's message was clear . The under-thirty group belongs body and soul to the State . Their thinking has been molded from the earliest moment of com  --  prehension . Young people are taught it is wrong to have personal ambition or to harbor any thought that places self ahead of national interest . Mao 's motto is " Serve the People . " Sex before marriage is con  --  sidered a selfish and disgraceful act . " When middle school equivalent to our high school students get together , " Dr. Hatem went on , " they discuss political  --  cal ideology , agricultural re  --  forms , commune living , poetry , music , and art . There are often spirited arguments , but always with respect for opposing views . There is no talk of ro  --  mance , or sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and we have these wonderful discussions . There is no boy-girl tantalizing , no wandering off behind the wall or in the bushes . " On one occasion , I heard that a young couple in the group had been seen together rather frequently walking in the park , holding hands , and it was believed by their peers that they were becoming too friend  --  ly . Two of the women had a talk with Miss X and one of the young men had a talk with Mr. Y. In some societies , this would be considered gross inter  --  ference , but in The People 's Re  --  public , such concern is con  --  sidered an act of friendship  --  a sign of caring . " Dr. William T. Liu , of the University of Notre Dame 's Center for the Study of Man , offered similar testimony after his visit to China following an absence of twenty-five years . " To say that the sex instinct does not exist in The People 's Republic is absurd . The Chi nese do not deny that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of controlling their feelings . No courtship or romance is permitted or even tacitly approved in school , including the univer  --  sity level . Boys and girls are not exactly segregated during the adolescent years , but the emphasis is on party participation and not on personal relationships . Unisex uniforms , and the absence of feminine makeup have helped to de-sex ' gender differences . Premarital sex is considered not only immoral but unpatriotic . But to say it does not exist is simply untrue . Oc  --  currences of premarital sex are probably more frequent in the rural areas than in the cities , and among certain occupational groups where the nature of the working environment allows privacy . " Dr. William T. Liu had the twin ad  --  vantages of being able to speak the lan  --  guage and spend time in the countryside , which I did not . My " research " was done exclusively in the cities  --  Peking , Darlien , Shenyang , Tientsin , Shanghai and Canton . But the bottom line is the same . Premari  --  tal sex in The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( very bad ) . When one compares the sexual conduct of Chinese teenagers to their opposite numbers in the United States , the Scandinavian countries , England , France , Holland , Italy , Germany and Japan , there is a world of difference , and that difference is a real mind-bender . I encountered an attractive group of Danish students in the hotel  --  a half dozen young men and women , eighteen and nineteen years of age , touring China as members of The Friendship Club . Since they were gracious and friendly when we met in the lobby , I decided to pull up a chair as they were having breakfast the following morning . I introduced myself as " an American citizen interested in teen  --  agers . " " Are you enjoying yourselves ? " I asked . ( A safe question for openers . ) " Wonderful , " they responded , almost with one voice . " Do you find the Chinese teenagers friendly ? " I continued . " Oh , yes , " was the reply . " In what ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . Before anyone could answer , I decided to pose a more direct question . " Do you find it odd that there is so little sexual activity among the young people here  --  or am I mistaken ? " A fine-looking lad with a marvelous blond beard spoke up . " We talked about that with some Chinese students just last night . They were not critical of our life  --  style , but they let us know it seemed strange to them that we consider sex a normal part of exploring one another as human beings . In fact , one young Chinese factory worker asked if we felt guilty , wasting our time experimenting with sex when we could be improving our minds and becoming more useful to The State . " " Do you honestly believe that all Chi , nese young people are abstain  --  ing from sex ? " I asked . " Not all , " shot back one of the young women . " They told us about two of their friends who are having a difficult time right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her a few days ago and suggested that she have an abortion . The girl is nineteen , and her boyfriend is twenty . They can be legally married if they wish , but they decided against marriage be  --  cause they feel they are too young . According to Chairman Mao , the best age for a woman to marry is twenty-five , and for a man , it is twenty-eight . And if Mao says so , that 's it . " " So what is a couple ex  --  pected to do in the meantime ? " I asked . " Very little , " laughed a handsome blue-eyed lad who had been silent until then . " I really do n't understand it , but I do believe it . When a whole generation is brought up with such rigid convictions , a person who deviates from the pre  --  scribed pattern of behavior is considered a misfit  --  or even a traitor . " " What is going to happen to that pregnant girl and her boy  --  friend ? " I asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteered the blue-eyed lad . " I have met some members of the Revolu  --  tionary Committee , and they can be very persuasive . " " Can the girl be forced to have an abor  --  tion if she does n't want one ? " I asked . " No , " replied the sun-tanned beauty in braids . " Abortions are not compulsory , but I am told they are performed in hos  --  pitals , free of charge , and if the woman is employed , she gets two weeks off work with full pay . " " What if the couple should decide to marry and have the child ? " I asked . The students looked at one another quiz  --  zically , and shrugged their shoulders . One of the young women spoke up . " I suppose their families would be disgraced , and it would weigh heavily against the couple 's chances for higher education . It certainly would be a black mark on their work records . " My visit with the Danish students cost me my breakfast . While I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned cold at the adjoining table where I should have been sitting . But it was worth it . " Are you coming , Eppie ? " asked Dr. Claude Welch , a Harvard Medical School surgeon , with whom I had been assigned to share a car and chauffeur for the day . " We 're off to a hospital in three minutes to see some acupuncture surgery . " I bid a hasty farewell to my Danish friends , and made notes in the car all the way to the hospital . The welcoming committee ( as always ) was extremely cor  --  dial . The women physicians , es  --  pecially , were most gracious . After witnessing thirty minutes of a knee operation performed with acupuncture , I decided to wander off on my own . ( I had seen the identical procedure the previous day and it was n't all that exciting . ) Even though I was wearing a surgical gown and head cover  --  ing , my face was visible and there 's no way I could have been mistaken for a Chinese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have asked if " guests " are accompanied at all times by a guide . The answer is " no . " In the corridor I encoun  --  tered an interpreter who had been most helpful and friendly . I asked if he would like to show me around the hospital gar  --  dens , which were quite lovely . He said he would be pleased to do so . Together we walked out into the ninety-five-degree heat which did n't bother me , since I happen to be an Iowa girl who is impervious to weather . " This morning I had an inter  --  esting visit with some Danish students , " I began . " They were telling me about an unmarried Chinese girl who became pregnant . What do you suppose will happen to her ? " I asked . " That is a very unusual occurrence , " re  --  plied my friend . " If she is of legal age ( eighteen ) she can marry , but it would be better for her to have an abortion . " " In America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged couples , that is , couples who plan to marry , to have sexual relations . Is this true in your country ? " " Nobody is engaged in China , " was his immediate response . " The custom is un  --  heard of . One is either married or single . " " I have not seen a wedding ring since I came to The People 's Republic . Why is that ? " I asked . " Because wedding rings were part of the old traditional religious ceremonies , " my friend replied . " Chairman Mao did away with all that in 1949 . " " How then can a man tell if a woman is available for marriage ? " I inquired . " Does he just come right out and ask her ? " My friend looked stricken . " Never ! Such a question would be considered ex  --  tremely rude . When a man is interested in the status of a woman he must inquire of a friend or a relative . " " Are you married ? " I asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be even more indelicate of a woman to put such a question to a man . " I am , indeed , " was his curt reply . " And my wife and I get along fine . And now I think that it is time for us to be getting back to the hospital . " With that , he quickly ushered me back to the main entrance of the hospital and did not speak another word . I am not a blusher by nature , but I felt the back of my neck warm . I do n't dare think of the impression I must have created by asking that question . I was never so happy to see the inside of a hospital in all my life . We arrived in time to bid farewell to our hosts and return to the hotel . It was there that I became acquainted with Wang Lee Huo , a nineteen-year-old student interpret  --  er . She was a delight and we became " old friends " at once . Wang Lee would have been considered a nifty chick by American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perfect teeth , and sparkling eyes . Her hair , black as a raven 's wing , hung in long braids which she tied with white ribbons . Wang Lee took a liking to me and came to my room to visit on several occasions . Twice she was sudden  --  ly " summoned " to do errands for her su  --  pervisor . It soon became apparent that Madame Supervisor did not approve of our private visits . When she came to deliver an extra carafe of bottled water , I asked , " Do you have a boyfriend ? " " No boyfriend , " Wang Lee replied . " I am much too young . I must spend several years yet on self-improvement , working and studying . " I pressed further . " Surely there must be some young man who is more interesting to you , more attrac  --  tive than the others . Human na  --  ture is the same the world over . Members of the opposite sex become drawn to one another . Such feelings are normal . It is essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creep into your head ? " Wang Lee 's eyes brightened . " Oh yes , once in a while , " she confessed . " But I drive them out immediately and replace them with thoughts of Chair  --  man Mao . He is the most excit  --  ing man of all and I would never disappoint him . " Her answer astonished me . " You must have a great deal of self-discipline to do this , " I said . " Please do not pay me such a high compliment , " Wang Lee replied . " It is not so difficult . For me it could be no other way . " I heard the words , but some  --  how I could not reconcile them with a young woman possessing such an abundance of feminine charm . " Do you ever wonder what kind of man you will marry one day ? " I asked , hoping to get some insight into the qualities a Chinese woman might look for in a husband . " Marriage for me is a long way off , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no hurry . At this moment I can see no benefits from being married . I have a great deal to learn and there is so much work to do . Our country is struggling and I am a part of that struggle . You can not imagine what life was like for my parents and my grandparents . My father died from tuberculosis when he was only thirty-six years old . My mother died from snail fever when she was forty-two . They had no chance . I have been given an opportunity to go to school and enjoy good health . I have a responsibility to the New Order to repay them for these gifts . It would be unthinkable for me to waste my time in self-indulgence . If I find that I am Continued on page 80 manded that everyone rise and join him . It was a blessed escape for my dinner companion , whose ear I had virtually chewed off on a subject he did not particularly relish . When we were seated the doctor turned to an  --  other subject . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not describe , since it might reveal my friend 's identity , I had an opportu  --  nity to spend several uninterrupted hours with a highly intelligent and well-informed Chinese woman . She was in her early to middle thirties , attractive , spoke good English , and had a sense of humor which I enjoy  --  ed immensely . Hiked her at once . Mrs. X told me about her work . She expressed pleasure that The Peo  --  ple 's Republic and America were now " friends . " " Are you married ? " was one of the first questions I asked . " Yes , " she replied . " We have a son who is eight years old . " " Only one child ? " I asked . " One is enough , " she said with an air of finality . " Perhaps you will have another later ? " I suggested . " Oh no , " she assured me . " I had a metal ring put in . " " I have talked with several people in your country about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very little of it here . Is that correct ? " I asked . " I would say , for the most part , yes . Especially in the large cities . " She continued , " I was married when I was twenty-five and I was a virgin . My husband was twenty-seven , and he had had no sex experience before our marriage . So far as I know it was the same with most of our friends . " " Now that you are married , " I went on , " do you and your husband enjoy sex ? " " I must be honest and confess that I find it a nuisance , " she sighed . " I accommodate him two or three times a month , but for me it is noth  --  ing but a duty . " " Have you ever discussed this with a doctor ? " 1 inquired . " Why should I ? " she snapped . " I am not sick . I am simply not interest  --  ed in sex . Many of the women I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you interested in ? " I asked . Her response was immediate and convincing . " I am interested in my work . The People 's Republic is a de  --  veloping country . There is much to be done . I get fulfillment and satis  --  faction from helping to build a great nation . You can not imagine what it is like for a woman in this country to have opportunities equal to those of a man . For centuries the Chinese fe  --  male was nothing . They threw away the girl babies . Now a woman can do everything a man can do if she is willing and proves herself capable . Did you know our Minister of Health is a woman ? This would have been impossible twenty-five years ago . For centuries , the woman 's role in China was to bear children . Now there are too many people in the world , and woman 's role is com  --  pletely different . " Sex is something that happens only between two people . For me , it is much more exciting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sexual desires of my hus  --  band . " I asked which contraceptive was the most popular in The People 's Republic . " It varies according to the city , " she replied . " In Peking , it is the pill . In Shenyang and Shanghai , it is the ' rubber cover . ' In Canton , the metal ring . Abortions , tubal liga  --  tions , and vasectomies are perform  --  ed free everywhere and a woman can take two weeks off work after an abortion , with full pay . For vasecto  --  mies , it is only three days . " She con  --  tinued , " The government pays a sti  --  pend for two children only . Chair  --  man Mao says two children is a nice family and three is one too many . " I thoroughly enjoyed our frank exchange and I 'm sure that for her , it was something of a catharsis . I was especially flattered when she con  --  fessed that never before had she dis  --  cussed such intimate subjects with a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my variety of sources is correct , and I earnestly believe it is , The People 's Republic may well approach zero population growth by the year 2000 . But nothing is so constant as change . This new nation will not remain so puritanical , nor its inhabitants so completely dedicated , forever . When the masses begin to enjoy a higher standard of living , they will demand automobiles , TV , perfume , chiffon nightgowns , air conditioning , fash  --  ionable clothes , annual vacations , and more time off . With leisure time and luxuries are bound to come some of the same problems we are struggling with in America . The " fringe benefits " of affluence and permissiveness are bound to take their toll . But for now , the year 1975 , one can not help being im  --  pressed by their progress in control  --  ling sex and cutting down on the size of their population . Yet , I left also wondering what sacrifices have been made in terms of the joys of ro  --  mance , the excitement of young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in marriage . To turn Wang Lee 's statement around , " The People 's Republic of China is a great place to visit , but I would n't want to live there . "
