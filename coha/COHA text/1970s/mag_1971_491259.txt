If it moves , man will race in it , on it , with it . Schooners , ostriches , locomotives , dogsleds , aircraft , elephants ? man has put them all to the race . And if man races it , other men will come to watch . No , not to watch . This is too passive . They come for the emotional involvement of the combat ? and it is always combat , with winners and losers set apart with no ambiguity to them . They come to join their souls with the men who race , to share either that sweet taste of triumph or that other taste of ashes . Men have raced in automobiles for as long as there have been automobiles to race . The first organized auto race was held in Paris in 1887 , five years before Charles Duryea claimed to have invented the automobile in the United States . Why do they race ? This question troubles the rational part of us that worries about man 's instinct to combat . Racing seems anachronistic in a society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when individuals can clearly win . Or lose . There is money for the men who race automobiles . Thirty-three drivers at the Indianapolis 500 raced for more than $1.000,000 in prize money last year . And there are the glamour , the girls , the adulating friendship of great men in our society . But men would race without any of this . Had organized racing never been invented , or were it to be outlawed by all the nations of the world , men would still race their automobiles . They would meet for duels on the Utah salt flats , on empty roads and deserted airstrips , on the hard beaches of California and Florida . And if there were no one to challenge , then they would race against stopwatches over these same improvised courses . And , in fact , this goes on even though organized racing was invented and the nations have not convened to outlaw it . Man races because of the instinct to combat anything that would dominate him and to prove his dominion over his environment . When man races he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the other men and their cars . When he wins he has triumphed over nature , over technology , over his fellows . It is a magnificent triumph . Somewhere within us all , hidden in an immutable chromosome , is the universal hunger for this triumph . People climb mountains not for any practical purpose , but because they have been put there for those men to test themselves against the natural environment . And there is no practical accomplishment for the men who race on foot against each other . They do it to win , to prove themselves to be better than their competitors . And men are in combat with the environment they have made for themselves , with their own technology . A few years ago in Indianapolis , a man shot a vending machine that took his money and would n't serve him . For a few days , that man was a folk hero - he had beaten the machine that threatens us all . The men who race automobiles are in the same sort of combat . The good drivers , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the drivers are pushing their cars to the limits - and sometimes far beyond - set by laws of physics , the properties of metals , and similar impositions on the human spirit . They are in combat to prove that the races are won by men , not by cars . And we watch them race for much the same reasons - to share the combat and the triumph over the environments of nature , technology and other men . We ca n't deny it : the automobile is in our blood . Baseball may still be called the national pastime , but more Americans watch automobile racing . Indeed , auto racing drew more paying spectators in 1969 than baseball , basketball or football : 41,000,000 as against 38,000.000 football , 37,000,000 baseball and 27,000,000 basketball . And the drivers ? Why do they give themselves to what is demonstrably the most dangerous sport man has devised , a sport that makes bullfighting look positively safe , a sport that has killed more than 300 drivers since World War II alone ( and probably half that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , France , in 1955 ) ? There are two obvious explanations and one that is obscure . Some men race simply because they have discovered that it 's the thing they do best , as other men are accountants because they have an affinity for numbers and others are salesmen because they are persuasive . Some men race for money . A golden rainbow beckons them : Al Unser , American champion and Indianapolis winner , won $448,145 in 1970 . The winner got $271,697 and even the man who came in 33rd - dead last - got $13,677 . Expertise and the hope of reward aside , all drivers who rise to the level of true professional competence are motivated ( even though some of them are n't aware of it ) by a soaring sensual delight , a pleasure the French have called la malaise de vitesse , or speed madness . Some atavistic wellspring in man has made speed itself a source of pleasure . The automobile is unique in conveying the sensation of speed . A rate of 700 miles an hour in an airplane at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A driver sitting six inches off the ground in an automobile doing 185 mph can feel speed . Further , he has a sense of total control of it . He is his own master , he knows omnipotence , he is a king , every decision he makes is his alone . And the penalty for gross error is death . Talking of the delight of speed in its highest form - not on a straightaway , not on an oval course , but on a winding , uphill-and-down , twolane-wide road-racing grand prix circuit - Stirling Moss , one of the six greatest drivers of all time , told me that the excitement generated was so great that it could be compared with nothing else in life save sex . Master of 400 horsepower in a car weighing less than a Volkswagen , so taut and responsive that it makes a family sedan feel like a tugboat in heavy seas , the race driver reaches and sustains a level of excitement that most men never come near knowing . The mores of the profession dictate an appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race a driver 's heart may register 140 to 180 beats a minute , the same range as an astronaut 's at blast-off . In experiments using radio-transmitted data , some drivers have not dropped below a pulse rate of 150 for an entire race . Racing drivers share characteristics that set them apart from other men . Extensive psychological testing of five top-ranked British grand prix drivers showed that they were well above average in intelligence but only average in reaction time and mental speed - until they were put under severe stress , when they could reach levels far beyond normal . Their ability to concentrate for long periods was very high and they almost never behaved impulsively . Race drivers seem to find it harder to retire than any other category of athlete-entertainers . They know the roar of the crowd that the actor knows ; they know the athlete 's joy in competition - but they also know the sensual delight of speed and the ultimate excitement that comes with deliberately risking life itself . And realization of that risk is persistent : every professional driver remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This may be the reason they tend not to form close and lasting personal relationships either in friendship or love . They think of racing as the real world and the rest of existence as unimportant . They know what Karl Wallenda - head of " The Flying Wallendas , " the greatest high-wire troupe of all time - meant when he said , " To be on the wire is life . The rest is waiting . " Ball or ball-and-stick games are all alike across the land : played on standardized fields or courts with standardized equipment , but auto racing has many varied forms , about 15 in all - from Indianapolis or " championship " cars which can cost over $50,000 each ( $20,000 to 535.000 for the engine alone ) to Volksw  --  gen-based Formula Vee racers at a tenth of that . The little " sprint cars " which look like shrunken Indianapolis machines run on half-mile dirt tracks , the even smaller " midgets " on quarter- and half-mile tracks . Stock cars , which appear to be identical with the sedans on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do 180 to 200 mph ) , run on paved and banked circuits , the most important of them in the South , where fact-backed legend has it the sport originated in the endless contest between whiskey runners and revenuers . There are Trans-Am cars which are stock cars for road-race courses instead of oval tracks , and Can-Am ( Canadian-American ) sports-racing cars , the most potent of all : weighing 1,500 pounds , some of them have 700 horsepower . The Sports Car Club of America sponsors races all over the country for its 18,500 members and once a year the Formula 1 or grand prix machines come from Europe for the Grand Prix of the United States at Watkins Glen , N.Y. , where Cameron Argetsinger revived U.S. road-racing in 1948 . Grand prix cars are the aristocrats of racing . competing in a March-to-October schedule in one race in South Africa , Spain , Monaco , Belgium , Holland , France , England , Germany , Austria , Italy , Canada , the United States and Mexico . ( The 1971 Mexican Grand Prix has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the 1970 event . The first attempt to stage a race in Israel , in December 1970 , had to be abandoned for the same reason . This phenomenon has been noted from the beginning . When people to whom it is unfamiliar are first exposed to motor racing , they characteristically reach a level of excitement that puts them beyond control by anything less than riot police . ) Auto racing goes a long way back , at least to 1887 , when the magazine VELOCIPEDE sponsored a race in Paris . One entrant appeared . The Paris-Rouen race of 1894 was more popular : 21 starters , with the fastest averaging a hot II miles an hour . The United States got into the act in 1896 with a 54-mile race organized by the Chicago Times-Herald for $5,000 in prize money . It was run in a foot of snow and only one of the six cars crossed the finish line ? after a long stop to have a blacksmith weld up the steering gear . It was a Duryea , built by Charles and Frank Duryea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who drove , averaged 7.5 miles an hour . Technical development of the automobile engine was quick in coming : by 1900 speeds in the 70-to-90-mph range were possible . The engines were powerful , but the rest of the automobile , chassis , wheels , tires , was crude and undependable . In May 1903 , some 250 cars started the Paris-Madrid race . They were waved off by 100,000 spectators and about 3,000,000 more lined the road to the Spanish border . The roads were so dusty that drivers found themselves steering by the tops of the telegraph poles ? at 70 miles an hour . Potholes blew tires and broke axles , the inadequate two-wheel brakes failed , drivers who did n't know the forces involved or the techniques necessary ( nu one knew then ) lost control and their cars flew off the road into trees , spectators , even houses . A precise count of the dead was never made ? one of them was Marcel Renault , brother to the founder of the famous French firm ? and the authorities stopped it all at Bordeaux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Paris . They were shipped by rail . The Paris-Madrid virtually ended city-to-city , open-road racing . The Mille Miglia ( 1,000 Mile ) race down one side of the Italian peninsula and up the other lasted until 1957 , when the Marquis de Portago , his co-driver and 13 spectators were killed . The Targa Florio in Sicily is now the only one left and the oldest race in the world , first run in 1906 . The Vanderbilt Cup races on Long Island , beginning in 1904 , drew the biggest crowds seen in this country before or since and one of the reasons for their abandonment in 1910 was despair of the authorities over their control . Spectators carried wire cutters for the fences and hawkers sold feather-tipped sticks ? with which to try to touch the drivers as they boomed past at around 90 mph . The most telling argument against road racing was financial : there 's no way to collect ticket money from people lining 40 miles of country highway . The round or oval track with a high wall around it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men caused 3,200.000 ten-pound paving bricks to be laid in a two-and-a-half-mile oval a little way outside Indianapolis . The first events were failures despite such timely novelties as an airplane-automobile match race , but in 1911 founder Carl Fisher hit on the saving formula : one 500-mile race , once a year . His writ has run true ever since , and Indianapolis is the most profitable race circuit in the world . Devotees till the place to the rafters on race day and the qualifying runs the week before are nearly as popular : Forbes magazine estimates that Indianapolis grosses $6,000,000 every May . During the rest of the year the track is up for hire to manufacturers for test work and a golf course in the infield brings in the odd penny , too . Not all tracks do as well . The Sears Point , California , circuit lost $300,000 in a year and gave up . The big Daytona plant , site of major stock car races , makes money , but only barely . Still , more than $25,000,000 went into a new circuit at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxurious , it combines oval , drag strip and road courses , so cunningly laid out that every foot of racing surface is visible to spectators , a rarity indeed . From every view , motor racing is expensive ? so expensive that only corporate entities or public treasuries can support it . Briggs Cunningham , an eminence in sports-car racing and yachting ( he successfully defended the America 's Cup in 1958 ) , built and campaigned his own cars in the 1950 's in a much-admired attempt to win the Le Mans 24 Hours Race . He almost succeeded ( there were three Cunninghams in the first ten places in 1953 ) at a cost well into seven figures . The Ford Motor Company spent close to $40,000,000 in a racing program that produced the first American cars to win at Le Mans ( in 1966 and 1967 ) . The theory supporting industry participation in racing bases itself on a conviction that the attendant publicity justifies the expenditure . Tire , gasoline , oil companies trumpet the news , postrace , that their products were decisive in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illogically , buy the stuff for the family sedan . This conception , originated and most effectively exploited down the years by Mercedes-Benz of Germany , is losing ground currently . Detroit 's open support of stock-car racing has dropped sharply since the 1950 's when the cars really were almost factory standard . Perhaps too many people know now that the engine and running-gear have been rebuilt at a cost that may touch $35,000 and that even the body is a feather-light fiber-glass shell . As sheer spectacle , racing is unique among entertainments . The sound and fury of the Indianapolis start , as 15,000 horsepower is unleashed in the first turn , is indescribably exciting . So is drag racing : two spidery-looking vehicles , side by side , accelerating from standstill to 225 miles an hour in a quarter of a mile and six seconds and a fraction . They throw out parachutes to stop . Brakes would never do it . A purely American phenomenon was the board track , timber from end to end , steeply banked , dead smooth and very fast . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rey , California , cost only $75,000 in 1910 . Most luxurious was the mile-and-a-quarter Beverly Hills circuit . A crew of 1,200 men built the track in five days flat and the whole plant , down to the last flowerpot , was finished in five weeks . The running surface of the board tracks ( there were 24 of these circuits in all ) was edge-laid , straight-grain 2x4 timbers and the curved sections of the best ones , plotted to a railroad engineering formula ? the Searles Spiral Easement Curve ? would hold cars going through them at absolute top speed . If a driver knew the proper line through the curve , he could take his hands off the steering wheel . Many records were broken on the board tracks , but their perfection helped kill them off . Because they were so fast , the car that started first too often finished first and that made for monotonous racing . They were short-lived , too ; within five to seven years the surface would begin to break up . The drivers loved their speed and hated // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of a matchstick was a little one . ( " They 'd go into your forehead , hit the bone and then spread out , " one driver recalled . ) A big one could be a pine knot or a slab of wood a foot long . In the course of a single race , a crack might widen into a foot-wide hole . Carpenters had to try to patch them while the race went on and small boys who 'd sneaked in stuck their heads up through the holes to watch the cars coming , a practice some drivers found unsettling . When the board-track era ended in 1931 , U.S. race cars went to dirt and paved ovals and there they stayed for about 20 years , evolving into a type of machine to be seen nowhere else in the world . The American track car was built to do one thing only : run at more or less constant speed in a counterclockwise direction on a smooth track with wide-radius bends . Steering , suspension and brakes were not important . The engine was supremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly suited to its purpose that it powered racing cars for more than 50 years ? and still does . This was the Miller engine , later called the Offenhauser and then the Meyer-Drake . Twenty-eight of the 33 cars in the 1927 running of the Indianapolis race carried Miller engines , a fair index of their superiority . European racing never forgot its direct descent from the city-to-city races and round-andround racing found small favor there . When classic open-road racing was banned in most countries ( England had never allowed it ) . / European promoters arranged for regular highways to be blocked off for a weekend of racing , as at Rheims in France , or used part open-road and part race-course , as at Le Mans , or built cir-Th cuits closely simulating open road ? the most impressive of these the 14-mile Mirburgring in Germany . Nothing like the board track was known in Europe , or anything that resembled the cars that ran on the boards . The Europeans built the road-racing car , quite a different beast . Instead of running in a steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , as a ) track car does , a road car may , in every tap-ofal long race , range between 30 and 185 , or go up and down hills as steep as 1-in-5 , or go around 30 corners , some of them hairpins . The Monaco Grand Prix , for example , demands a gear shift every three seconds . For this kind of going a race car must have a superlative engine and the most efficient brakes , springing and steering available . The seminal European designers ? Bugatti of France , Mercedes-Benz and Auto-Union of Germany , Alfa-Romeo , Maserati , Ferrari of Italy ? built this kind of machine half a world away from the Americans . Airtight insularity polarized the two . American and European drivers almost never met . What little they knew of each other hearsay told them and the messages were garbled . The Americans saw the Europeans as gentlemen amateurs in silk ascots and chamois driving gloves , airily waving each other through the corners ; the Europeans believed the Americans pugnacious truck drivers barren of skill save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And each thought the others ' cars ridiculous . Before the sea change that came with the transatlantic air freighter , opportunities for interchange were few . In 1913 Peugeot of France sent a team of new cars to Indianapolis , small-engined compared with the big power plants then in vogue , but off the drafting board of a master Swiss designer , Ernest Henry , and bright with innovations still thought modern 40 years later : double overhead camshafts , multiple valves , the hemispheric combustion chambers Chrysler touted in the 1950 's . Jules Goux won for Peugeot that year , supported by a volunteer American pit manager and six half bottles of champagne . ( " Sans le bon vin , " he said afterward , " je n'aurais pas et'e en etas de faire la victoire ! " ) He had also killed the big engine . For 1914 Indianapolis specified 300-cubic-inch engines instead of the 450 's previously standard . Eight years later , in 1921 , Jimmy Murphy won the Grand Prix of France , run over the Le Mans circuit , in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grand prix . Three others have done it since . Murphy 's was a clean-cu t victory ? owed , technicians thought , to superior tires and four-wheel hydraulic braking ? but no rapprochement between the Amerieans and the Europeans came of it , rather the contilky . Occasionally , in the following years , a European car showed up at Indianapolis . Wilbur Shaw won two of his three " 500 " first places in a Masetati , but the impact was slight , because few in the race-going public thought of it as Italian . Shaw was sure that the Maserati 's sophisticated suspension gave him an advantage , but other drivers , still thoroughly parochial , gave more weight to Shaw 's great ability and stuck with the home product . Monza in Italy was the site of the next meet-ing , a 500-mile race its organizers called La Cop-pa di Due Month " The Cup of Two Worlds " ) . The event was run in June 1957 , and after the dust had settled a British motoring journalist wrote , " With the possible exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no race since the war has aroused such prolonged , hitter and widespread controversy .... " The scheme was ambitious : to bring to Europe a covey of ten Indianapolis cars and pit them against ten European grand prix machines . It foundered on hard reality : The standard Indianapolis car of the 1950 's , called a " roadster , " was designed for left-hand turns only . It carried a built-in weight bias to that end and even its tires were molded to mate with the Indy banking . Its two-speed gearbox was rudimentary and brakes were used only in emergency and for stopping at the pits . So the Americans wanted a rolling start , a counterclockwise course and no hard turns . And of necessity they would use the big 4.2-liter engines peculiar to Indianapolis . This , the European drivers argued , could be no contest . Their engines were only 2.5 liters in capacity , built to the standard laid down by the world governing body of racing , La Fed &ation; Internationale de /Automobile . ( Indianapolis regulations do not meet the F.I.A . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't count toward the world championship . ) On the Monza road circuit , where they could use their brakes , four-speed gearboxes and superior suspension , they might have a chance , but on the adjoining banked oval , obviously none at all . The European Drivers ' Association declined and the promoters had to scratch together a motley field of five cars : three Jaguar sports cars , a Ferrari sports car and a 3.5-liter Maserati grand prix car . One of the American cars and both Italians had practice breakdowns , so the actual start saw nine Indy cars against three Jaguars , the Jaguar two-seater sports cars straight from 24 hours of flat-out running at Le Mans three days before , where they had finished fast and fourth . There would be three heats of 170 miles each , with an hour interval between . The race was comedic . The pace car led the rolling start at 80 mph , a speed so low for the American cars that the drivers were hard pressed to hold it . When the flag fell one of the Jaguars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver , Jack Fairman , standing on the accelera-tor through each of his four gears . For an instant the Americans suspected there had been dirty work at the crossroads , but Fairman was only amusing himself and striking a thin blow for the Continued on page 104 Empire : he knew he could n't match the 175-mph top speed of the Indy cars once they got underway - and in any case the Jaguars were under strict orders not to exceed 150 , to save their tires . Jimmy Bryan of Arizona won the first heat and the second . The hour intervals were busy times for the Americans : their suspensions , built for the smooth Indianapolis surface , were unable to cope with the rough Monza surface and the cars began to break up , exhaust pipes coming off , fuel tanks splitting and so on . Only three were able to come to the line to start the final heat against the three Jaguars . And when the smoke had settled and the points had been added up , Jimmy Bryan had won for America , Indy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four , five and six . The Monza fiasco had only widened the gap . The Americans said they had conclusively blown off the European drivers . The Europeans said they had beaten only sports cars , not grand prix cars , that the top-line drivers had n't competed and argued that Indy cars were triumphs of the blacksmith 's craft , so crude that without two hours of repair time all ten of them , not just seven , would have broken up , giving the race to the Jags , which had had no mechanical trouble . On the other hand , the Americans had respected the " let 's have a go " attitude of the Jaguar drivers and the Europeans had admired the splendid Offenhauser engines and the beautiful finish of the U.S. cars . Overall , though , it was a case of no love lost . No resumption of hostilities was immediately scheduled , but early in 1961 sentries on the Indianapolis barricades spotted a lone scout coming down the pike : Jack Brabham , an Australian veteran of the grand prix circuit . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natives : it was green , a color long frowned on as one of the three major Indy superstitions ( the others : no peanuts or women in the pits ) . Its small - 2.5 liter - engine was mounted in the rear instead of in front and it had a four-speed gearbox . In fact , there was nothing strange about Brabham 's car , it was a Coventry-Climax powered Cooper , a grand prix device , standard even to its bottle-green paint job . ( Green is the F.I.A.-assigned national color for Britain , as red is for Italy , blue for France and pale violet for Egypt . ) Brabham proposed running the Cooper around the course a few times . He was , he said later , overwhelmed with kindness and hospitality . Americans are like that and , too , the Indy people were sure the poor fellow did n't know what he was up against . After all , good menhave spent years trying to drive really fast on the Indy circuit . Brabham had never seen the place before and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rodger Ward , 1959 " 500 " winner . drove him around the course in a station wagon and then Brabham cranked up his little green automobile . He was soon lapping at 140 mph ; he demonstrated his judgment of pace ( race cars do n't carry speedometers ) by doing three consecutive laps at precisely 142.857 mph and he ran his last lap at 144.8 , faster than all but ten of the cars that had qualified for the 1960 race . One of the stunned onlookers , a driver , said , " If he had an Offenhauser in there he 'd run around all day at 150 . " ( At the time no one had yet touched 150 mph at Indianapolis . ) The blow fell in 1963 . Dan Gurney of California , a longtime competitor here and in Europe , the only American ever to win a grand prix in a car of his own manufacture ( Belgium , 1967 ) , had brought together Henry Ford and Colin Chapman of England . designer and builder of the Lotus car . Primacy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before World War II the German Auto-Union and Mercedes-Benz cars had been unbeatable . Afterward , the Italians dominated grand prix racing with the Alfa-Romeo , the Maserati and the fabulous Ferrari . When John Cooper decided to get a smaller frontal area and thus higher speed - by putting the engine in the rear instead of in front and the driver in a semireclining position instead of sitting bolt upright in the air stream - the balance swung to the British . Cohn Chapman became the most successful exponent of the principle . At the same time , a spate of great British drivers began to surface . Ford had a long racing history . Barney Oldfielcl had driven for Ford , and Henry Ford himself once held the land-speed record . Gurney was convinced that although the company had n't built a racing engine in decades , Ford could , in a crash program , make one that would be fast and , equally importantly , reliable . The engine would have power for the straightaways , the sophisticated Lotus chassis would be quicker Ihrough the corners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads , sometimes in pouring rain , would find Indianapolis no harder to master than Brabham had . Ford was convinced . " After that , " an observer said at the time , " it was just a matter of Ford 's making two phone calls . He called one guy and told him to get some people together and make an engine . He called another fella and told him to unlock the vault where they kept the money . " Two Lotus-Fords showed up for the 1963 race , one for Jimmy Clark , a Scotsman who was champion of the world that year , the other for Dan Gurney . They both qualified at 149 miles an hour . At the 100-mile mark , Parnelli Jones was leading in an Indy roadster . When he stopped for fuel , Clark and Gurney moved up to first and second places , holding there until at250 miles they had to refuel . The final phase of the race was a duel between Clark and Jones . Clark believed he had speed to pass Jones in the final laps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it coming from a split external tank on Jones ' car . One of the strictest Indianapolis rules is that a car leaking oil shall he flagged into the pits , but the decision to pull Jones in ( which would have cost him the race ) was put off by the stewards while they watched him through binoculars and listened to furious arguments from Colin Chapman and the owner of Jones ' car , the veteran entrant J. C. Agajanian . Finally it was decided that the leak had fixed itself and Jones went on to win . All hands blanketed their tempers with gentlemanly statements to the press . Two other factors had helped beat Clark : slow pit work and his literal observance of the rules , habitually treated with a certain elasticity by experienced Indianapolis drivers . Clark set a new record of 158 mph to qualify in first position for the 1964 race and took the lead as soon as the flag fell . The race was stopped by a multiple accident that killed two drivers and put five others out of contention . When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until a rear tire threw its tread . Colin Chapman had elected to use Dunlop tires instead of the Firestones standard at Indy for 40 years and they had not been up to it . A. J. Foyt - a tremendously talented and fiercely competitive driver who has won more than 250 major races in the last decade - came in first , scoring what turned out to he the last victory for the Indy roadster . The next year , 1965 , found 17 Fords in the race and only two front-engined cars . Jimmy Clark came with the right tires and one of the fastest pit crews that ever worked at Indianapolis ; he qualified at 160 mph and won at his pleasure , going away . Andy Granatelli , driver , car builder , tycoon , was next in line to buck the entrenched Indianapolis establishment . Granatelli brought a secret weapon in 1967 : a Pratt &; Whitney gas-turbine helicopter engine . Driver Parnelli Jones rode on the right side of the car ; the engine lived on the left , driving all four wheels through fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't worked , so Granatelli 's entry caused little consternation until it began to be evident in practice that Jones was n't using anything like all the power available to him . It was only at the start that the full horror of the situation dawned , when Jones passed five cars with ludicrous ease and in a corner at that . He ran away and hid from everybody until , seven and a half miles from victory , a five-dollar ball bearing broke and killed the engine and his chances . The authorities later ruled that turbines of the size Granatelli had used were henceforward illegal . Granatelli sued , pro forma , but entered smaller turbine cars the next year . Two started side by side in the front row , Joe Leonard set a qualification record that still stands and one was leading nine laps from the end with another three laps behind , when both their engines failed simultaneously from the same cause : sudden wide-open throttle application . That was the end of the turbines , but Granatelli won anyway and satisfied a lifelong ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mario Andretti driving . Racing is no less reactionary than other institutions and the way of the innovator has ever been hard . Jim Hall of Texas ? a significant figure in the international sports car community as driver and builder ? developed , with Chevrolet , a so-called " vacuu rn-cleaner " car . This , the Chaparral 2J , was a hovercraft in reverse : a separate engine exhausted air from beneath the car to such effect that it would stick upside down on a ceiling ! Since the car was practically incapable of skidding , it was so fast through the corners , where races are won or lost , that world champion Jackie Stewart said he literally could not bring himself to believe it . The device was outlawed . Another reactionary force is the effort of public authorities to restrict racing speeds . ( Or to outlaw it altogether , as Switzerland has done and as Senator Richard Neuberger of Oregon proposed doing a few years ago . The Vatican recently issued a statement deploring the deaths of 17 drivers in 1970 . ) Speed-restriction efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the designers . Despite losing a skirmish now and then stock-car speeds were recently forced down from about 200 to 180 mph by carburetor restriction ? the designers seem always to win the battles . Indeed , the British authority Lawrence Pomeroy once stated as " Pomeroy 's Law " that the rate of increase could be predictably charted . Seventy-five miles an hour was enough to win Indianapolis in 1911 . The 1970 lap record now was nearly 172 . The first land-speed mark officially noted was 32.9 mph in 1898 . It stands today at 622.4 . The driver rarely complains that speeds are too high , only that some circuits are unsafe . Caged in steel tubing to keep the car from crushing him , nailed to the chassis by safety harness , layered from head to foot in flame-resistant clothing ( it gives 30 seconds of immunity to the 2,400-degree temperature of burning gasoline ) , he is prepared to go cheerfully in harm 's way . It 's most unlikely that anyone will make a car so fast that a man wo n't get into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose from . There are not today , in all the world , more than 25 men capable of extending the fastest cars to their absolute limit on a difficult course like the Niirburgring . But as long as there are 25 men like that , and hundreds more ready to risk everything to displace them at the top , millions will come to watch . Et
