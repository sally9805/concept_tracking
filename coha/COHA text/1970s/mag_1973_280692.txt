" If people want to get stoned and trip out on acid or Jesus , that 's their business . But if those things do n't work , I 've got something that will : love , appreciation and sincerity . " <P> Can a performer who talks like that survive for even a minute in today 's pop-music miasma of drugs , decadence and dowdy religiosity ? If he is Singer-Composer John Denver , 29 , the answer is yes . The possessor of long blond hair and a mellifluous , if reedy , tenor voice , the wearer of gold-rimmed glasses and neatly pressed shirts , Denver is the Tom Sawyer of rock-and he has acquired a vast following of Becky Thatchers and Aunt Pollys as well as a few Huck Finns . <P> Hardboiled rock critics do not exactly get mad at Denver-nobody does that-but he is so wholesome that they reach for mild epithets like " saccharine , " " bland " and " decent mediocrity . " <P> He says " Yes , sir " to hotel clerks , picks litter off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his music , says Mary Travers , late of Peter , Paul and Mary , the group that had a Top Ten hit in 1969 with Denver 's Leaving on a Jet Plane : " His songs are simple and hopeful .

Denver lives there by choice , having seen most of the U.S. while growing up as the son of an Air Force lieutenant colonel . " I wanted to be accepted , so I worked on things that would make people like me , " he says . Such as the guitar he bought at age 13 , when he found himself alone once again at a new school in Montgomery , Ala . <P> Denver entered Texas Tech University as an architecture major , but spent much of his time playing folk or rhythm and blues at local clubs . After 2 years , he pulled out for the hootenanny life of Southern California , along the way changing his name from Henry John Deutschendorf Jr . In 1965 he joined the Chad Mitchell Trio , replacing Chad Mitchell himself , who was going out on his own .

Within the past year he has made six specials for BBC , lined up guest-acting stints in the U.S. on both the Owen Marshall and McCloud series , and has two specials in the works for ABC . Last week he taped a Bob Hope special for November airing .
