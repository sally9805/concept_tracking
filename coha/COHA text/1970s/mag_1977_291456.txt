CHARIOT OF FIRE <P> by E.E.Y. HALES <P> 191 pages . Doubleday . $6.95 . <P> <P> Henry Brock is an English bachelor and a railway man with a precise idea of heaven : " The right sort of train to London ... a morning train , with a good breakfast car , lots of coffee and toast and bacon and eggs and marmalade , the newspaper , and two or three hours of pleasantly changing views through the window . " Alas , such bliss is denied him . On holiday in Italy , Brock and his girl friend are drowned when their cruise ship sinks . Because of his record of unrepented fornications , he is sentenced to the Second Circle of Hell - Dante 's Circle of the Lascivious . <P> Affronted , Brock purloins a ticket to heaven instead . But paradise makes him uncomfortable , despite the music ( Faur 's Requiem , Beethoven 's Ninth ) , the soaring entrance hall and the " little mayonnaise concoctions " served by white-robed nuns . Brock gladly boards a plane for his assigned place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus British Historian E.E.Y. Hales sets the stage for an engaging theological fantasy that would have done credit to the late Anglican author C.S. Lewis . Like Lewis ' Great Divorce and George Bernard Shaw 's Don Juan section of Man and Superman , Chariot of Fire suggests that hell is what one makes of it - and so is heaven . <P> Brock is not about to take hell lying down . Before falling completely into his rut , the ex-railroader busies himself with refurbishing the Limbo Line , a rickety train that runs from the First to the Fourth Circle of Hell - home of the avaricious . He is swiftly drawn into infernal politics . Cleopatra , the Second Circle 's reigning queen , wants to rule all upper hell . Sister Martha , a heavenly busybody who wants to liberate souls from Limbo , will not hear of this . Satan , naturally , is enraged by Cleopatra 's ambition . <P> Brock suddenly becomes the indispensable man in the middle . Satan needs the Limbo Line to transport cannon across the bottomless mud of the gluttons ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Miltonic war against Satan , needs the railroad to carry his chariot of fire across the same sea of mud . <P> Town Dump . All of this would seem preposterous if Author Hales did not charm the reader with the earthiness of his hell . There are no fork-wielding demons and no brimstone . It is only in the town dump that " the fire is not quenched and the worm dieth not . " Though Hales draws many of his characters from Dante 's subterranean aristocracy , he sketches them with fresh wit . Cleopatra , for instance , has something of an American accent because she has been " surrounded , for the last hundred years at least , more by Americans than British . " <P> Brock is not irrevocably lost . His shrewd shuttle diplomacy in hell puts him in a unique position to demand a reward . To reveal what that is would spoil the reader 's fun , but the prize under lines the irony of the sign that greeted him in the Second Circle : " Hell is where you are free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayo Mohs
