&gt; One of the more common bits of folklore about American Indians is that they are less able than whites to hold their liquor because of an inherited intolerance for alcohol . Now two medical researchers at a Phoenix , Ariz. , branch of the National Institutes of Health and the Indiana University School of Medicine have challenged that belief . Using 30 Indian and 30 white volunteers as test subjects , Drs . Lynn J. Bennion and Ting-Kai Li let each slowly down a 3-oz. jigger of 50% ethanol , the form of alcohol in liquor . After a lapse of 90 minutes to allow total absorption of the alcohol into the bloodstream , they began taking blood samples from the subjects once every 30 minutes over a three-hour period . The tests invariably showed that the rates at which ethanol disappeared from subjects ' bloodstreams did not differ by race . Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine , the researchers conclude that there is no significant difference in the way Indians and whites get ( or do n't get ) stewed . <P> &gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poisonous mushroom Amanita phalloides . Commonly known as the death cap , it causes , after a day 's delay , severe abdominal pain , followed by diarrhea , cramps and vomiting and finally liver failure and central nervous damage . In Europe , where mushroom collecting has long been a favorite hobby of gourmets , the hard-to-identify Amanita phalloides accounts for perhaps 95% of the dozens of deaths that occur every year from mushroom poisoning of some kind . Until recently the death cap was considered relatively rare in North America , and only a few cases of poisoning have been attributed to it . <P> Now the U.S. Public Health Service 's Center for Disease Control reports new evidence that Amanita phalloides may not be as uncommon in the New World as hitherto believed . For example , in October two people died of mushroom poisoning-a 37-year-old Martha 's Vineyard resident who collected Amanita phalloides in his backyard and a 70-year-old Bronx man who picked the mushrooms in a New York park and ate them .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
