MIDDLE EAST/COVER STORY <P> " Palestine is the cement that holds the Arab world together , or it is the explosive that blows it apart . " - Yasser Arafat <P> The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization was clearly fighting his emotions as he addressed the 18 Arab Kings , Presidents , Emirs and other leaders gathered round a horseshoe table in Morocco 's Rabat Hilton . " This summit conference has been like a wedding feast for the Palestinians , " said Yasser Arafat . After four days of sometimes bitter debate , the Arab summit-attended by such luminaries as Saudi Arabia 's King Faisal , Egypt 's President Anwar Sadat , Algeria 's Houari Boumedienne and Syria 's Hafez Assad-had radically and dramatically altered the Middle East situation . The leaders , including even Jordan 's acquiescent King Hussein , for the first time had unanimously endorsed Arafat instead of Hussein as " sole legitimate " spokesman for all Palestinians , including the 640,000 who live under Israeli occupation on the West Bank of the Jordan River .

The Israelis have steadfastly insisted that any future settlement involving the West Bank must involve Jordan ; they have refused even to consider discussions with what Premier Yitzhak Rabin has described as " terrorist organizations whose avowed aim is Israel 's destruction . " The Rabat decision seemed to mean that there could be no negotiations on the West Bank-and for that matter no overall settlement-unless the Palestinian question , meaning the P.L.O. , was faced directly . <P> Henry Kissinger was in New Delhi ( see following story ) when he learned of the Arab leaders ' endorsement of the P.L.O . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of Middle East peace negotiations . " I do not believe , " he said , " that the door to all negotiations in the Middle East is closed . But in what framework there can be negotiations-that will have to be seen . " * <P> The plan that Kissinger had discussed with Sadat on his last visit to Cairo in October called for step-by-step phased negotiations between Israel and Egypt followed by talks between Jordan and Israel on the future of the West Bank-a program that now seems unlikely if not impossible . Kissinger will fly back to the area next week for a firsthand check on what the Arab decision does to his policy of " gradualism " in negotiations . <P> Discouraging Relations . Understandably , he has a particular interest in discovering how the summit decision affects the most moderate of Arab leaders , Egyptian President Sadat . At Rabat , Sadat denied that the endorsement of Arafat would affect his own negotiating plans . The fact is , however , that Egypt 's           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
