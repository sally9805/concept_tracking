Corrective ads for Listerine <P> In promotions stretching back to 1921 , Warner-Lambert has asserted that its Listerine mouthwash helps prevent colds and sore throats . Last week that claim was finally snuffed out by a fatal regulatory infection called truth in advertising . The Supreme Court declined to review a lower court decision upholding a 1975 Federal Trade Commission order : the company must not only stop making the claim but specifically advertise that it is not true . In its next $10 million worth of Listerine ads-about a year 's budget-Warner-Lambert must insert this statement : " Listerine will not help prevent colds or sore throats or lessen their severity . " In the course of its review , which began in 1972 , the FTC found that Listerine was no more effective in combatting colds than warm water . Doubtless Warner-Lambert will bury the admission as inconspicuously as possible in ads declaring that Listerine does cure bad breath-another old claim . <P> Nonetheless , last week 's Supreme Court refusal to review the order is a significant boost for the FTC . The agency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " corrective " ads asserting in effect that their previous ads made false claims . Companies bowing to such orders include ITT , Continental Baking for Profile bread ( whose claimed fewer calories per slice , the FTC charged , was attained simply by making its slices thinner ) , Ocean Spray for cranberry juice and Amstar for Domino sugar . All signed consent decrees ; Warner-Lambert was the first to ask the courts to rule that it did not have to take back its previous claims . Now that it has definitively lost , says a jubilant FTC staffer , " I think we will see more corrective ads in the future . "
