 | The Old Man Contributing editor King has been son , father , and ? since his thirty-ninth year ? grandfather . He is convinced that being a father is the most complex and demanding of these roles . While we digested our suppers on The Old Man 's front porch , his grandchildren chased fireflies in the summer dusk and , in turn , were playfully chased by neighborhood dogs . As always , The Old Man had carefully locked the collar of his workday khakis . He recalled favored horses and mules from his farming days , remembering their names and personalities though they had been thirty or forty years dead . 1 gave him a brief thumbnail sketch of William Faulkner ? Mississippian , great writer , appreciator of the soil and good bourbon ? before quoting what Faulkner had written of the mule : " He will draw a wagon or a plow but he will not run a race . He will not try to jump anything he does not indubitably know beforehand he can jump ; he will not enter any place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side ; he will work for you patiently for ten years for the chance to kick you once . " The Old Man cackled in delight . " That feller sure knowed his mules , " he said . SONS RARELY GET TO KNOW their fathers very well , less well , certainly , than fathers get to know their sons . More of an intimidating nature remains for the father to conceal , he being cast in the role of example-setter . Sons know their own guilty intimidations . Eventually , however , they graduate their fears of the lash or the frown , learn that their transgressions have been handed down for generations . Fathers are more likely to consider their own sins to have been original . The son may ultimately boast to the father of his own darker conquests or more wicked dirkings : perhaps out of some need to declare his personal independence , or out of some perverted wish to settle a childish score , or simply because the young ? not yet forged in the furnace of blood ? understand less about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . Remembering yesterday 's thrashings. or angry because the 80 fathers did not provide the desired social or economic advantages , sons sometimes reveal themselves in cruel ways . Wild tigers claw the poor father for failures real or imagined : opportunities fumbled . aborted marriages . punishments misplaced . There is this , too : a man who has discovered a likeness in his own image willing to believe ( far beyond what the evidence requires ) that he combines the natural qualities of Santa Claus , Superman , and the senior Saints , will not easily surrender to more mature judgments . Long after the junior partner has ceased to believe that he may have been adopted , or that beating-off will grow hair on the hand while the brain slow IN congeals into gangrenous matter , the father may pose and pretend . hiding bits and pieces of yesterday behind his back . Almost any father with the precious stuff to care can adequately conceal the pea . It is natural in sons to lust ? yes , to hunger for ? an Old Man special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steel . Or , failing the ideal , to have a father who will at least remain sturdy , loyal , and there when life 's vigilantes come riding with the hangman . You see the fix the poor bastard is in , do n't you ? He must at once apologize and inspire , conceal and judge , strut and intervene , correct and pretend . No matter how far he ranges outside his normal capabilities , he will remain unappreciated through much of the paternal voyage ? often neglected , frequently misread , sometimes profaned by his own creation . For all this , the father may evolve into a better man : may find himself closer to being what he claims . a strong role having ways of overpowering the actor . And if he is doubly blessed , he may know a day when his sons ( by then , most likely , fathers themselves ) will come to love him more than the ! can bring themselves to say . Then , sometimes , sons get to know their fathers a bit : perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday would have believed . 81 THERE WAS THAT BLINDLY ADORING PERIOD of childhood when my father was the strongest and wisest of men . He would scare off the bears my . dung imagination feared as they prowled the night outside our Texas farmhouse , provide sunshine d peanut butter , make the world go away . I brought him my broken toys and my skinned ees . He did imitations of all the barnyard animals ; when we boxed he saw to it that I won by knockouts . After his predawn winter milkings , shivering and stomping his numb feet while rushing to throw more wood on the fire , he warned that tomorrow morning , by gosh , he planned to laze abed and eat peach cobbler while his youngest son performed the icy chores . He took me along when he hunted rabbits and squirrels , and on alternate Saturdays when he bounced in a horse-drawn wagon over dirt roads to accomplish his limited commercial possibilities in Putnam or Cisco . He thrilled me with tales of his own small-boy peregrinations : an odyssey to Missouri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxen , fordings of swift rivers , and pauses in Indian camps where my grandfather . Morris Miles King , smoked strong pipes with his hosts and ate with his fingers from iron kettles containing what he later called dog stew . The Old Man taught me to whistle , pray , ride a horse , enjoy country music , and , by his example , to smoke . He taught that credit-buying was unmanly , unwise , and probably unforgivable in Heaven ; that one honored one 's women , one 's flag , and one 's pride ; that , on evidence supplied by the Biblical source of " winds blowing from the four corners of the earth , " the world was most assuredly flat . He taught me the Old Time Religion , to bait a fishhook or gut a butchered hog , and to sing " The Nigger Preacher and the Bear . " I had no way of knowing what courage was in the man he with no education , no hope of quick riches , no visible improvements or excitements beckoning to new horizons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and kind . No matter how difficult those Depression times , there was always something under the Christmas tree . When I was four , he walked five miles to town in a blizzard , then returned as it worsened , carrying a red rocking chair and smaller gifts in a gunnysack . Though he had violated his creed by buying on credit , he made it possible for Santa Claus to appear on time . I would learn that he refused to accept the largess of one of FDR 's recovery agencies because he feared I might be shamed or marked by wearing to school its telltale olive drab " relief shirts . " He did accept employment with the Works Progress Administration , shoveling and hauling wagonloads of dirt and gravel for a road-building project . When I brought home the latest joke from the rural school ? " WPA stands for ' We Piddle Around ' " ? he delivered a stern , voice-quavering lecture : Son , the WPA is a honest way some poor men has of makin ' their families a livin ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next time some smart @# aleck makes a joke about it , you ought to knock a goddamned whistlin ' fart out of him . Children learn that others have fathers with more money , more opportunity , or more sophistication . Their own ambitions or resentments rise , inspiring them to reject the simpler wants of an earlier time . The son is shamed by the father 's speech , dress , car , occupation , and table manners . The desire to flee the family nest ( or , at bottom , to soar higher in it ; to undertake some few experimental solos ) arrives long before the young have their proper wings or before their parents can conceive of it . The Old Man was an old-fashioned father , one who relied on corporal punishments , Biblical exhortations , and a ready temper . He was not a man who dreamed much , or who understood that others might require dreams as their opium . Though he held idleness to be as useless and as sinful as adventure , he had the misfortune to sire a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic superior to grinding work . By the time I entered the troublesome teen-age years , we were on the way to a long dark journey . A mutual thirst to prevail existed ? some crazy stubborn infectious contagious will to avoid the slightest surrender . The Old Man strapped , rope-whipped , and caned me for smoking , drinking , lying , avoiding church , skipping school , and laying out at night . Having once been very close , we now lashed out at each other in the manner of rejected lovers on the occasion of each new disappointment . I thought The Old Man blind to the wonders and potentials of the real world ; could not fathom how current events or cultural habits so vital to my contemporaries could be considered so frivolous , or worse . In turn , The Old Man expected me to obediently accept his own values : show more concern over the ultimate disposition of my eternal soul , eschew easy paths when walking tougher ones might somehow purify , be not so inquisitive or damnfool dreamy . That I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and angered him . In desperation he moved from a " wet " town to a " dry " one , in the foolish illusion that this tactic might keep his baby boy out of saloons . On a Saturday in my fifteenth year , when I refused an order to dig a cesspool in our backyard because of larger plans downtown , I fought back : it was savage and ugly ? though , as those things go , one hell of a good fight . Only losers emerged , however . After that we spoke in terse mumbles or angry shouts , not to communicate with civility for three years . The Old Man paraded to a series of punishing and uninspiring jobs ? night watchman , dock loader for a creamery , construction worker , chicken-butcher in a steamy , stinking poultry house , while I trekked to my own part-time jobs or to school . When school was out I usually repaired to one distant oil field or another , remaining until classes began anew . Before my eighteenth birthday , I escaped by joining the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man paused at the kitchen table , where I sat trying to choke down breakfast . He wore the faded old 81   crossed-gallus denim overalls I held in superior contempt and carried a lunch bucket in preparation of whatever dismal job then rode him . " Lawrence , " he said , " is there anything I can do for you ? " I shook my head . " You need any money ? " " No . " The Old Man shuffled uncertainly , causing the floor to creak . " Well , " he said , " I wish you good luck . " I nodded in the direction of my bacon and eggs . A moment later the front door slammed , followed by the grinding of gears The Old Man always accomplished in confronting even the simplest machinery . Alone in a Fort Dix crowd of olive drab , I lay popeyed on my bunk at night , chain-smoking , as Midland High School 's initial 1946 football game approached . The impossible dream was that some magic carpet might transport me back to those anticipatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet , tantalizing glimpses of their panties , and we purple-clads whooped and clattered toward the red-shirted Odessa Broncos or the Angry Orange of San Angelo . Waste and desolation lived in the heart 's private country on the night that opening game was accomplished on the happiest playing field of my forfeited youth . The next morning , a Saturday , I was called to the Orderly Room to accept a telegram ? a form of communication that had always meant death or other disasters . I tore it open with the darkest fantasies to read : MIDLAND 26 EL PASO YSELTA 0 LOVE DAD . Those valuable communiques arrived on ten consecutive Saturday mornings . With a ten-day furlough to spend , I appeared unannounced and before a cold dawn on the porch of that familiar , frame house in Midland . The Old Man rose quickly , dispensing greetings in his woolly long-handles . " You just a First Class Private ? " he teased . " Lord God , I would a-thought a King would be a General by now . Reckon I 'll have to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Most of the time , however ( when I was not out impressing the girls with my PFC stripe ) a cautious reserve prevailed . We talked haltingly , carefully , probing as uncertainly as two neophyte premed students might explore their first skin boil . On the third or fourth day , The Old Man woke me on the sleeping porch , lunch bucket in hand . " Lawrence , " he said , " your mother found a bottle of whiskey in your suitcase . Now , you know this is a teetotal home . We never had a bottle of whiskey in a home of ours , and we been married since 19-and-11 . You 're perfectly welcome to stay here , but your whiskey 's not . " I stiffly mumbled something about going to a motel . " You know better than that , " The Old Man scolded . " We do n't want you goin ' off to no blamed motel . " Then , in a weary exasperation not fully appreciated until dealing with transgressions among my own offspring : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise ole billy hell all the time ? " We regarded each other in a helpless silence . " Do what you think is right , " he said , sighing . " I 've done told you how me and your mother feel . " He went off to work ; I got up and removed the offending liquids . The final morning brought a wet freeze blowing down from Amarillo by way of the North Pole . The Old Man 's car would n't start ; our family had never officially recognized taxis . " I 'll walk you to the bus station , " he said , bundling in a heavy sheepskin jumper and turning his back , I suspect , so as not to witness my mother 's struggle against tears . We shivered down dark streets past homes of my former schoolmates , by vacant lots where I played softball or slept off secret sprees , past stores I remembered for their bargains in Moon Pies and then Lucky Strikes and finally Trojans . Nostalgia and old guilts blew in with the wind . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter some gracious goodbye ( the nearest thing to retroactive apologies a savage young pride would permit ) , but I simply knew no beginnings . We sat an eternity in the unreal lights of the bus station among crying babies , hung-over cowboys . and drowsing old Mexican men , in mute inspection of those dead shows provided by bare walls and ceilings . The Old Man made a silent offering of a cigarette . He was a vigorous fifty-nine then , still clear-eyed , dark-haired , and muscular , but as his hand extended that cigarette pack and I saw it clearly ? weather-cured , scarred , one finger crooked and stiff-jointed from an industrial accident ? I suddenly and inexplicably knew that one day The Old Man would wither , fail , die . In that moment , I think , I first sensed ? if did not understand ? something of mortality ; of tribes , blood , and inherited rituals . At the door to the bus , The Old Man suddenly hugged me , roughly , briefly : not certain , perhaps . such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . His voice broke as he said , " Write us , son . We love you . " I clasped his hand and brushed past , too full for words . For I knew , then , that I loved him , too , and had , even in the worst of times , and would never stop . WE TOOK A TRIP LAST SUMMER , one The Old Man had secretly coveted for a lifetime . though , in the end , he almost had to be prodded into the car . " I hate like the devil to leave Cora , " he said of his wife of almost six decades . " She 's got to where her head swims when she walks up and down the steps . She taken a bad spill just a few weeks ago . I try to stay close enough to catch her if she falls . " The Old Man did not look as if he could catch much of a falling load as he approached eightythree . Two hundred pounds of muscle and sinew created by hard work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior clothing flapped about him . He had not worn his bargain dentures for years , except when my mother insisted on enforcing the code of some rare social function , because , he complained , they played the devil with his gums , or gagged him , or both . The eagle 's gleam was gone from eyes turned watery and rheumy ; he could n't hear so well anymore ; he spoke in a wisp. voice full of false starts and tuneless whistles requiring full attention . @# He was thirteen years retired from his last salaried job , and he had established himself as a yardtender and general handyman . He mowed lawns , trimmed hedges , tilled flower beds , grubbed stumps , painted houses , performed light carpentry or emergency plumbings . In his eightieth year , my mother decreed that he might no longer climb trees for pruning purposes . Though he lived with that verdict . his eyes disapproved it just as they had when sons dictated that he might no longer work ring the hottest part of the desert summer days . Thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( not driving a car or giving up cigarettes ) throwing him into a restless depression . He continued to rise each morning at five , prowling house impatiently on rainy days , muttering and growling of all the grass that needed mowing or of how far behind Midland was falling in unpainted fences . At such times he might complain because the vial Security Administration refused him permission to earn more than $1,200 annually while ntinuing to merit its assistance : he sneaked in  - -  ore work by the simple expediency of lowering nis prices . Except on the Sabbath ( when , by his ethic , the normal joy of work translated to sin ) , he ; referred the indoors only when eating or sleeping . He had long repaired to a sleeping porch of his own creation , where it was always twenty degrees cooler - winter and correspondingly hotter in the summertime ; one of the curses of modernity , he held , " refrigerated air . " On my mother 's reassurances that she would - rend a few days with her twin sister , we coaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , I had asked him whether he wanted to see some particular place or thing and whether I might take him there . To my 1 prise ( for The Old Man had never hinted of secret passions ) , he said yes , he had wanted since childhood to visit the State Capitol in Austin and the Alamo in San Antonio : he had read of them in books his mother had obtained when his father 's death had cut off his schooling . I had long procrastinated . Living in the distant Sodoms and Gomorrahs of the East , I wandered in worlds alien to my father in search of ambitions that surely mystified him . There were flying trips home : an hour 's domino-playing here , an evening of conversation there . Then the desert would become too still , dark , and forbidding : I would shake his worn old hand , mutter promises and excuses , grab a suitcase ; run . List summer my wife effectively nagged me to deliver on my old pledge . And so , one boiling morning in July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside me on the front seat , shrunken and somehow remote , yet transmitting some youthful eagerness . The older he had grown , the less The Old Man had ever troubled to talk , contenting himself with sly grins or solemn stares so well-timed you sometimes suspected he heard better than advertised . Deliver ) m a grandchild to tease and he would open up : Bradley Clayton King , I hear turrible things on you . Somebody said you got garments on your Lark . and you have ancestors . And word come to me lately that you was seen hesitatin ' on the door-@# step . " With others , however , he was slow to state his case . Now , however , we had hardly gone a mile before The Old Man began a monologue lasting almost a week . As we roared across the desert waste , his fuzzy old voice battled with the cool cat 's purr of the air conditioner ; he gestured , pointed , laughed , praised the land , took on new strength . He had a love for growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motherland ; for digging in the good earth , smelling it , conquering it . " Only job I ever had that could hold a candle to farmin ' , " he once said , " was blacksmithin ' . Then the car come along , and I was blowed up . " Probably his greatest disappointment was his failure as a farmer ? an end dictated by depressed prices in his most productive years , and hurried by land worn down through a lack of any effective application of the basic agrarian sciences . He was a walking-plow farmer , a mule-and-dray-horse farmer , a **28;854;TOOLONG farmer . If God brought rain at the wrong moment , crops rotted in the mud ; should He not bring it when required , they baked and died . You sowed , tilled , weeded , sweated : if Heaven felt more like reward than punishment , you would not be forced to enter the Farmer 's State Bank with your soiled felt hat in your hand . World War II forced The Old Man off the family acres : he simply could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised for faithful drudgery in its pipeline crew . And he felt , too , deep and simple patriotic stirrings : perhaps , if he carried enough heavy pipe quickly enough , the fall of Hitler and Tojo might be hastened . He alternately flared with temper fits and was quietly reflective on the fall day in 1942 when we quit the homestead he had come to in a covered wagon in 1894 ; later , receiving word of the accidental burning of that unpainted farmhouse , he walked around with tears in his eyes . He was past seventy before giving up his dream of one day returning to that embittered soil , of finally mastering it , of extracting its unkept promises . As we left behind the oil derricks and desert sandhills last summer , approaching barns and belts of greenery , The Old Man praised wild flowers , dairy herds , shoots of cotton , fields of grain . " That 's mighty good timberland , " he said . " Good grass . Cattle could bunch up in them little groves in the winter and turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies : " Now , Johnson grass will ruin a place . But mesquite trees is the most sapping thing that God lets grow . Mesquites spreads faster than gossip . A cow can drop her plop on a flat rock , and if she 's been eatin ' mesquite beans they 'll take a-holt and grow like mornin ' glories . " One realized , as The Old Man grew more and more enthusiastic over roadside growths and dribbling little creeks , just how fenced-in he had been for thirty years ; knew , freshly , the depth of his resentments as gas pumps , hamburger outlets , and supermarkets came to prosper within two blocks of his door . The Old Man had personally hammered  | and nailed his house together , in 1944 , positioning it on the town 's northmost extremity as if hoping it might sneak off one night to seek more bucolic roots . Midland had been a town of maybe 12,000 then ; now it flirted with 70,000 and the Chamber of Commerce mindlessly tub-thumped for more . The Old Man hated it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County so he might take another glimpse of the past . He slowly moved among the tombstones in a rural cemetery where his parents rested among parched grasses and the bones of their dear friends : people who had been around for the Civil War ; God-fearing , land-grubbing folk who had never dreamed that one day men would fly like birds in the sky or swim like fishes beneath the sea . Though he had on his best suit , he bent down to weed the family plot . I kneeled to help ; my young son joined us . We worked in silence and a cloaking heat , sharing unspoken tribal satisfactions . We drove past stations he recognized as important milestones : " Right over yonder ? the old house is gone now , been gone forty years ? but right there where you see that clump of them blamed mesquites , well , that was where your brother Weldon was borned. 19-and-15 , I reckon it was . We had two of the purtiest weepin ' willers you ever seen . I had me a dandy cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the car mastering it easily , where the horses or mules of my youth had strained in harness , rolling their eyes under The Old Man 's lash . " This durn hill , " he said . " I come down it on a bigwheel bicycle I 'd borrowed when I was about fifteen . First one I 'd seen , and I was taken with it . Did n't know no more about ridin ' it than I did about ' rithmetic . Come whizzin ' down so fast my feet could n't match them pedals : did n't have sense enough to coast . Wellsir , I run plumb over in the bar-ditch and flipped over . It taken hair , hide and all . " He laughed , and the laugh turned into a rasping cough , and the cough grew so violent that veins hammered at the edge of his sparse hair , and the old face turned crimson . Through it all he joyously slapped his leg . We stopped for lunch in a flawed little village where my father had once owned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and farmers taking their chicken-fried steaks or bowls of vegetable soup seriously , men who minutely inspected strangers and muted their conversations accordingly . Weary of the car and the road , The Old Man chose to stand among the crowded tables while awaiting his order . He was grandly indifferent to the sneaked upward glances of the diners , whose busy elbows threatened to spear him from all sides , and to the waitress who , frowning , danced around him in dispensing hamburgers or plates of hot cornbread . " Tell Grand Dad to sit down , " my teenage daughter , Kerri , whispered . " He 's all right , " I said . " Well , my gosh ! At least tell him to take off his hat ! " The Old Man startled a graybeard in khakis by gripping his arm just in time to check the elevation of a spoonful of mashed potatoes . " What 's your name ? " he inquired . The old nester 's eyes nervously consulted his companions before he surrendered it . " Do n't reckon I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of been around here long . " Twenty-some years , the affronted newcomer mumbled . " I had me a blacksmith shop right over yonder , " The Old Man said . He pointed through a soft-drink sign and its supporting wall . " It was in the 1920s . My name 's Clyde King . You recollect me ? " When the old nester failed the quiz , my father abandoned him to his mashed potatoes . " What 's your name ? " he inquired of a victim mired in his blackberry pie . My twelve-year-old son giggled : : his sister covered her humiliated face . He walked along a diminutive counter of ketchup bottles , fruit pies , and digestive aids , reading only those faces grizzled enough to remember . An aging rancher , deep in his iced tea , nodded : " Yeah . I remember you . " The Old Man pumped his hand . beaming . " I was just a kid-of-a-boy , " the rancher said . " I was better acquainted with your brother Rex . And the one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where they at now ? " The Old Man sobered himself : " Well , I buried ' em within three weeks of one another last month . Claude was seventy-eight and Rex was seventy-four . I 'm the only one of the King boys still kickin ' . Oldest of the bunch , too . If I live to the eighteenth day of next February , the Lord willin ' , I 'll be eighty-three year old . " " Well , you look in right good shape , " the rancher said . When The Old Man sat down at our booth ms daughter asked , too sweetly , " Grand Dad , you want me to take your hat ? " He gave her an amused glance , a look suggesting he had passed this way before . " Naw , " he said . " This a-way , I know where it 's at if this cafe catches a-fire and I need it in a hurry . " Then he removed the trespass to his outer knee and slowly crumbled crackers into the chili howl before bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMPTY WHEN I AWOKE in an Austin motel shortly after sunrise . He could be seen in contemplation of the swimming pool , turning his direct gaze on all who struggled toward their early jobs . Conversing with a black bellhop when I claimed him , he was full of new information : " That nigger tells me he averages a dollar a head for carrying - suitcases . I may buy me some fancy britches and give him some competition .... Folks sure must be sleepyheaded around here . I bet I walked a mile . and did n't see two dozen people . . . . Went over yonder to that Governor 's Mansion and rattled the gate and yelled , but did n't nobody come to let me in . " " Did you really ? " I asked , moderately appalled . " Thunder , yes ! I 'm a voter . Democrat , at that . " Then the sly country grin flashed in a way that keeps me wondering in the night , now , whether he really had . We entered a coffee shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . recoiling from the menu . " This place is high as a cat 's back .

" Well , the way things is now , I expect it run ten or twelve dollars . " No , the price had been thirty dollars . His old eyes bulged : " For one night ? Lord God , son , let 's git us a blanket and go to the wagon yard ! " " This here 's a heap bigger place than I thought it Mould be , " he said in a hushed voice as he inspected the polished chambers of the Texas House of Representatives .

He marveled at the expanse of grass on the Capitol grounds , inspected its flower beds , inquired of an attendant how many gallons of water the grounds required each day , and became stonily disapproving when the hired hand did not know . In the archives of the General Land Office , he painstakingly sought out the legal history of that farm his father had settled in the long ago . He was enchanted by the earliest maps of Texas counties he had known as a boy . That night he sat on his motel bed recalling the specifics of forgotten cattle trades , remembering the only time he got drunk ( at age sixteen ) and how the quart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his weeping mother that , if permitted to live , he would die before touching another drop .

" Somehow I stumbled through it . Never heard a word the preacher said that night : I was tryin ' to drum up nerve to approach Miss Cora , you see .

" We had just walked up on her daddy 's porch one evening and I said " ? and here The Old Man attempted again the deeper tones of youth , seeking the courtly country formality he had brought into play on that vital night , reciting as one might when called upon in Elocution Class in some old one-room schoolhouse ? " Miss Cora , I have not got much of this world 's goods , and of education I have n't none . But I fancy myself a man of decent habits , and if you will do me the honor of becoming my wife , I will do the best I can by you for always . ' " He bowed his head , hiding his tears . " Grand Dad , " my daughter asked , " did you kiss her ? " " Lord God . no ! " The Old Man was sin- 85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kissin ' THE OLD MAN was n't took lightly in them days . Between AUSTIN AND SAN ANTONIO we drove through San Marcos ; a prominent sign proclaimed that Lyndon B. Johnson had once earned a degree at the local teachers ' college . " That 's a mighty fine school , " The Old Man said . I remained silent . " Yessir , " he said , " a mighty fine school . " Only the purring air conditioner responded . The Old Man shifted elaborately on the seat . " Why , now , I expect that school 's as good a school as the Newnited States has . " By now he realized that a contest was joined : whatever joke he wished to make must be accomplished in the absence of my feeding straight-line . " I doubt if that Harvard outfit up yonder could hold a candle to this school , " he said . " I expect this school would put that Harvard bunch in the shade . " My son , less experienced in such games , provided the foil : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Got to be , " The Old Man said . " It learned ole Lyndon to have sense enough to know he could n't get elected again . " He enjoyed his chortle no less for the delay . Did n't you like President Johnson ? " my son asked . " Naw . LBJ told too many lies . I would n't a-shoed horses on credit for him . " " Who was your favorite President ? " " Harry- Truman . Harry was n't afraid to take the bull by the horns . Was n't no mealymouth goodygoody in him like in most politicians . Ole Ike , now , they flowed him up like Mister Big and all he ever showed me was that silly grin . " " Did you ever vote for a Republican ? " my son asked . " Yeah , in 19-and-28 . Voted for Herbert Hoover . And he no more than put his britches on the chair till we had a Depression . I promised God right then if He would n't send no more Depressions , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think God really cares who 's President ? " I asked . " I reckon not . " The Old Man said . " Look at what we got in there now . " What did The Old Man think of this age of protest and revolt ? " It plagues me some , " he admitted . " I got mad at them young boys that did n't want to fight in Vietnam . Then after the politicians botched it so had nobody could n't in it , and told lies to boot . I decided I would n't want to risk dyin ' in a war that did n't make sense . " It was suggested that no wars made sense . " Maybe so , " The Old Man said . Bible says . Thou Shalt Not Kill . ' Still vet , the Bible 's full of wars . Bible says there 'll be scars and rumors of wars . I do n't think war is what all the ruckus is about . though . I think young people is just generally confused . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , " he said : they had been raised in whiskey homes : their 86 @# preachers , teachers , politicians , and daddies had grown so money-mad and big-Ikey nothing else counted . Too much had been handed today 's kids on silver platters : they got cars too soon and matching big notions . They went off chasing false gods . Well , did n't guess he much blamed ' ern : they did n't have nothing waiting at home except babysitters , television , and mothers that cussed in mixed company or wore whiskey on the breath . " I seen all this coming during the Second World 's War , " The Old Man said . " People got to moving around so much with good cars . Families split up , and lost their roots . The main thing . though , was the w omen . Women had always stayed home and raised the kids : that was their job . It 's just nature . And the man of the family had to he out scratchin ' a living . But during that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular thing and smokin ' and drinkin ' in public . Triflin ' - started , and triflin ' led to divorces .

" There was little a divorced man could say . " I 'm thankful I raised my family when I did , " he said . " World 's too full of meanness and trouble these days . Ever ' other person you meet is a smart aleck. and the other one 's a crook . Them last few years I was workin ' for wages , there was n't one young feller in fifty willin ' to work . All they had in mind was puttin ' somethin ' over on somebody .

They laughed at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told ' ern I 'd hired out to work , by God . I would n't a-give a nickel for any of ' em . Did n't put no value on their personal word . I 'd lift them heavy milk crates ? lift a dozen to their one ? and when the drivers come in and their trucks had to be swamped out and cleaned . I 'd look around and be the only hand workin ' . " He shook his head . " They did n't care about nothin ' . Seemed like life was - well , some kind of a joke to ' em . " Now . " he said . " I think the niggers is raisin too much sand . Maybe I 'd be raisin ' ole hilly myself if I 'd been kinda left out of it like them . I du n no : it 's hard to wear the other feller 's shoes . But I just was n't raised up to believe they 're supposed to mix with us . It do n't seem natural . " " Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad . . , " " Oh . I know . " he said . Impatience was in his voice . This was an old battle fought between us many times without producing a victor ? even though we had selectively employed the Bible against each other . " You still mowing Willie 's lawn ? " I asked . " Ever ' Thursday . " The Old Man said . " Durn your hide , " he chuckled . Then : " Naw . Willie 's moved off to Houston or some place . " Willie was a male nurse and had been the , first black man to move into my father 's neighborhood eight years ago . Not long after that community despoiling . I visited home : great were the dire predictions hay- ing to do with Willie 's staying in his place . Six months later , we were sitting on the front porch . The black man walked into the yard . " Hey there , Old Timer , " he said . I stiffened : surely The Old Man would burn a cross , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Bear . " Instead he said , mildly , " How you , Doctor ? " " Can you do my lawn a couple days early next week ? I 'm having some people over for dinner Tuesday night . " " Reckon so , " The Old Man said . " Whatcha gon na have to eat ? " The black man smiled and said he thought he might burn some steaks on the grill . " You can tip me one of them beefsteaks . " The Old Man said , looking mischievous . " I 'm a plumb fool about beefsteak . " They laughed ; the black man complimented my father on his flower beds before giving him instructions on exactly how he wanted his shrubbery trimmed . The Old Man walked with him across the street to inspect the particulars . When he returned to ease back into his chair , I said ? affecting the flattest possible cracker twang ? " Boy Hidy. if that chocolate-coated sumbitch do n't stay in his place .. . " The Old Man 's grin was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they was all like ole Willie . " he said . " He works hard . he keeps hisself clean , to my knowledge he do n't drink and I do n't believe he 'd steal if he was hungry . " Then came one of those oblique twists of mind of which he was capable : " I do n't take his checks though . I make ' im pay cash . " Now , some years later , we were approaching San Antonio : " I always figgered this for just another little ole Meskin town except for havin ' the Alamo , " he said . Soon he was marveling at the city 's wonders , at the modern office buildings , old Spanishstyle homes , green parks and easy-riding rivers . The Old Man happily waved to passing paddle boats as we idled under a tree at a riverfront cafe . laughing through the tears at himself when ? mistaking a bowl of powerful peppers for stewed okra ? he spooned in a country mouthful requiring a hard run on all available ice water . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Right here , " he proclaimed ? pointing to a certain worn stone slab ? " is where Travis drawed a line with his sword and told all the boys willin ' to die for the right to step across . All of ' em stepped across except Jim Bowie , who was sick on a cot , and he had his buddies carry him across . " Just why he had selected that particular stone not even historians may attest : the much-restored Alamo must make do with the smaller original artifacts and the wilder romanticisms . Indeed , where much of the blood was spilled . a prestige department store now stands . He moved among display cases containing precious bits and pieces of a more vigorous time : wooden pegs serving purposes later to be preempted by metal hinges , square-headed nails , early Colt firearms , crude chisels and hand-operated bellows , @# arrowheads , saddlebags , oxen yokes , tintype photos , the earliest barbed wire , a country doctor 's bag with crude equipment such as an old uncle had carried in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses of each relic , carefully associating himself ? and his blood 's blood ? with that older time and place . He came to a new authority ; his voice improved . Soon a group of tourists followed him about , the bolder ones asking questions . The Old Man performed as if he had been there during the siege . Choosing a spot on the outer walls , he said with conviction that " right over yonder " was where the invaders had fatally broken through . ( " Daddy , " my daughter whispered , " will you please get him to stop saying Meskin ' ? " ) Taking a last look , he said , " Ma bought me a book on the Alamo . I must of read it a hundred times . I read how them damn Meskins done Travis and his brave boys , how ole General Santa Anna had butchered all them Texas heroes , and I promised myself if I ever seen one of them greaser sonsa-bitches , why , I 'd kill him with my bare hands . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice today , half the people in that Alamo was Meskins ? And they seemed to think just as much of it as we do . " Now it was late afternoon . His sap suddenly ran low ; he seemed more fragile , a tired old head with a journey to make ; he dangerously stumbled on a curbstone . Crossing a busy intersection , I took his arm . Though that arm had once pounded anvils into submission , it felt incredibly frail . My children , fueled by youth 's inexhaustible gases , skipped and cavorted fully a block ahead . Negotiating the street , The Old Man half-laughed and half-snorted : " I recollect helpin ' you across lots of streets when you was little . Never had no notion that one day you 'd be doin ' the same for me . " Well , I said . Well . Then : " I 've helped that boy up there " ? motioning toward my distant and mobile son ? " across some few streets.Until now , it never once occurred that he may someday return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man said , " he will if you 're lucky . " @# THREE O'CLOCK IN AN AUSTIN MOTEL . The Old Man snores in competition with jet aircraft . On an adjoining bed his grandson 's measured breathing raises and lowers a pale banner of sheets . Earlier , the boy has exorcised his subconscious demons through sheet-tugging threshings and disjointed , indistinct private cries . The Old Man snores on , at peace . Night battles never plagued me , he once said in explaining his ability to sleep anyplace , anytime . I never was one to worry much . What people worry about is things they ca n't do nothin ' about . Worryin ' always seemed like a waste to me . The bridging gap between the two slumbering generations , himself an experienced insomniac , sits in the dark judging whether he would most appreciate a cold six-pack or the world 's earliest sunrise . Out of deference to The Old Man , he has known only limited contacts with those bracing  | stimulants and artificial aids for which his soft polluted body now begs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent the layman calls " memory " ? a drug of the most awful and powerful properties , one that may ravish the psyche even while nurturing the soul . Stiff penalties should be affixed to its possession , for its dangerous components include disappointing inventories , blocked punts , lumpy batters , and iron buckets of burden . It is habit-forming , near-to-maddening in large doses , and may even grow hair on the palms . I remembered that we had compromised our differences in about my twentieth year . My own early assumption of family responsibilities proved healing : in the natural confusions of matrimony , one soon came to appreciate The Old Man 's demanding , luckless role . Nothing is so leavening to the human species as to gaze upon the new and untried flesh of another human being and realize , in a combination of humility , amazement , and fear , that you are responsible for its creation and wellbeing . This discovery is almost immediately followed by a sharply heightened appreciation of more senior fathers . We discovered that we could talk again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silences . Could civilly exchange confl cting opinions , compete in dominoes rather than in more deadly games , romp on the lawn with our descendants , and share each new family pride or disappointment . For some four years in the early 1950s , we lived in close proximity . The Old Man came to accept my preference for whiskey as I came to accept his distaste for what it represented ; he learned to live with my skeptic 's atheism as I came to live with his belief that God was as tangible an entry as the Methodist Bishop . The Old Man was sixty-six and I was twenty-five when I went away for good . There were periodic trips back home , each of them somehow more hurried , fleeting , and blurred . Around 1960 , it dawned on me that The Old Man and his sons had , in effect , switched roles . On a day I can not name , he suddenly and wordlessly passed the family crown . Now the sons were solicited for advice or leadership , and would learn to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrenching paternal deference . ( Weldon , you reckon it would be all right if I got a better car ? Well , now , Dad , I believe I 'd go slow on that . Maybe you do n't see and hear well enough to drive in traffic very much . Lawrence , what would you say to me and your mother goin ' back to the farm ? Now , Dad , why in the world ? People have been starving off those old farms for fifty years . What would you do out there in the sticks , miles from a doctor , if you or mother got sick ? ) The heart of the young blacksmith continued to beat in that shrinking frame , however . He could not drive a car anymore ; he nodded off in the middle of the sermon at Asbury Methodist ; meddlers had barred him from climbing trees . He remained very much his own man , however , in vital areas . Living by his sweat , The Old Man saved an astonishing amount of his paltry pensions and earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , seldom rode when he could walk . tended the soil , ate well , and slept regularly . On that motel bed slept a man who , at age twelve . had fallen heir to the breadwinner 's role for a shotgun-widowed mother and eight younger siblings . He had accepted that burden , had discharged it without running off to sea : had drawn on some simple rugged country grace and faith permitting him no visible resentments then or later . He had sweated two family broods through famines and floods . Great Depressions and World Wars , industrial and sociological revolutions . Though a child of another century , really , he walked through the chaos and tediums of his time as determinedly ? as Faulkner wrote of women passing through grief and trouble ? " able to go through them and come out on the other side . " The faintest dawn showed through the windows when The Old Man sat up in bed , yawning : " Lord God , is it dinner time ? Must be , you bein ' awake ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep ? " Some . " How much ? " Three or four hours , I lied . " You ai n't gon na live to see fifty , " The Old Man predicted . " What you ought to do is buy you a cotton farm and work it all day . I bet you 'd sleep at night , then . " He almost hopped into his trousers from a standing position , amazingly agile in that fresh hour he most cherished . Noting my inspection he asked , " Reckon you can do that at eighty-two ? " Hell , I said , I ca n't do it at forty-one ; The Old Man celebrated this superiority with a pleased grin . The previous night he had insisted on playing dominoes past midnight in the home of a favorite nephew , Lanvil Gilbert , talking it up like a linebacker : Say you made five ? Why , that makes me so mad I 'll play my double-five ? and gim me fifteen while you got your marker handy .... I forgot to tell you boys I run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's class you might be able to git in . Back at the motel , he had again explored the distant past until his grandchildren yawned him to bed . Old Man , I thought , what is the secret ? What keeps you interested , laughing , loving each breath ? I remembered his enthusiastic voice on the telephone when I told him I had given my son his middle name : " I 'm puttin ' a five-dollar bill in the mail to buy him his first pair of long pants . Put it up and keep it . I want that exact five-dollar bill to pay for my namesake 's first long pants . " Grand satisfactions had visited his face earlier on our Austin trip when my son brought him a gigantic three-dollar pocket watch . The boy had shoved it at him ? " Here , Grand Dad , this is for you , I bought it out of my allowance " ? and then had moved quickly away from the dangers of sentimental thanks and unmanly hugs . As we started down to breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take Bradley Clayton with us ? " Sure , if he wants to go . The Old Man gently shook the boy . " Namesake , " he said . " Wake up . namesake , you sleepyhead . " The boy rolled over with reluctance , blinking , trying to focus . " Git up  | from there , " The Old Man said in feigned anger . - Time I was your age , I had milked six cows and owed two fields by this time-a-day . " ' What ? " the boy said , incredulous . " I 'll make you think what ! " The Old Man said . hen repeated his improbable claim . The boy . pulling his wits together , offered The Old Man a sample of the bloodline 's baiting humor : - Was that what made you rich ? " The Old Man whooped and tousled the boy 's hair , then mock-whipped him toward the bathroom . We talked late on my final night . The Old Man sat in his jerry-built house , on a couch across from a painting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights . Pictures of his grandchildren were on the walls and on the television top , along with a needlework repca of the Dead Kennedys appearing to hover over the U.S. Capitol , and a Woolworth print depicting a highly sanitized village blacksmith . One of his sons , thinking to please The Old Man , had given him the latter : while he appreciated the thought . he had been amused by the artist 's concept . " Lord-a-mercy , " he had chuckled , " the feller that painted that thing never seen a horse shod or a blacksmith shop either one . " The painting resealed a neat , sweatless man effortlessly bending a horseshoe as he worked in an imposing brick edifice surrounded by greenery , while little girls in spotless dresses romped happily among gleaming anvils possibly compounded of sterling silver . The lid Man enjoyed comparing it with the realities of photo made in the 1920 's , showing him grease stained and grimy in a collapsing wooden structure titled with indescribable debris . His hands ? always vital to his lip movements-wooped and darted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or vigorous dances according to the moment 's chin music . Just before bed , I asked in a : private moment whether he had any major regrets . " Two , " he said . " I wish I could of done better financially by your mother . I never meant for her to have such a hard life . And I wish I could of went : . , school . " On the morning of my departure , he was spry and fun-filled . Generally such leave-takings were accomplished in tensions and gloom : for a decade the unspoken thought had hovered that this might be the final goodbye . Last July , however , that melancholy tune was but faintly heard : The Old Ian was so vigorously alive that I began to think of him as a sure centenarian . I left him standing on the front porch , wearing his workman 's clothes , - baking a friendly fist against what he would do if I did n't write my mother more often . Six weeks later , he gathered a generous mess of turnip greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife with the request that she concoct her special cornbread . A few hours after his meal , he became dizzy and nauseous . " I just et too many of them turnip greens , " he explained : o his wife . Persuaded to the hospital for examination and medications , he insisted on returning borne on the grounds he had never spent a night in @# a hospital bed and was too old to begin . The next morning , in great pain , he consented to again be loaded into my brother 's car . The Old Man mischievously listed his age as " sixteen " with a crisp hospital functionary filling out the inevitable forms . He ordered nurses out when a doctor appeared , extracting a promise from my brother that " no womenfolks " would be permitted to intimately attend him . When the examining physician pressed his lower abdomen , The Old Man jerked and groaned . " Is that extremely sore , Mr. King ? " Well , yes , it was a right-smart sore . " How long has it been that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why did n't you tell me ? " my exasperated brother inquired . The old eyes danced through the pain : " Would n't a done no good , you not bein ' no doctor . " He consented to stay in the hospital , though he did complain that his lawnmower and supporting tools had been carelessly abandoned : would my brother see that they were locked in the backyard tool shed ? Then he shook my brother 's hand : " Weldon , thank you for everything . " He shortly lapsed into the final chills and fevers , and before I could reach home he was gone . I saw him in his final sleep , and now can not forget those magnificently weathered old hands . They told the story of a countryman 's life in an eloquent language of wrinkles , veins , old scars and new . The Old Man 's hands always bore some fresh scratch or cut as adornment , the result of his latest tangle with a scrap of wire , a rusted pipe , a stubborn root ; in death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable particular . No , it is not given to sons to know everything of their fathers ? mercifully , perhaps ? but I have those hands in my memory to supply evidence of the obligations he met , the sweat he gave , the honest deed performed . I like to think that you could look at those hands and read the better part of The Old Man 's heart . Clyde Clayton King lived eighty-two years , seven months , and twenty-five days . His widow , four of five children , seven of eight grandchildren , six great-grandchildren , and two **25;884;TOOLONG survive . His time extended from when " kissin ' was n't took lightly " to exhibitions of group sex ; from five years before men on horseback rushed to homestead the Cherokee Strip to a year beyond man 's first walk on the moon ; from a time when eleven of twelve American families existed on average annual incomes of $380 to today 's profitable tax-dodging conglomerates ; from the first Presidency of Grover Cleveland to the midterm confusions of Richard Nixon . Though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an airplane . He died owing no man , and knowing the satisfaction of having built his own house . I joined my brother and my son in gathering and locking away The Old Man 's tools in that backyard shed he had concocted of scrap lumbers , chipped bricks , assorted tins and reject roofing materials . Then , each alone with his thoughts , we moved in a concert of leaky garden hose and weathered sprinklers , lingering to water his lawn . HARPER 'S MAGAZINE APRIL 1971 89
