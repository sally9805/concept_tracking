For many years the Indians and early settlers of the American Southwest treasured the oil they pressed from the beans of the wild jojoba shrub . In Arizona and California the jojoba ( pronounced ho-ho-bah ) oil was used as a nostrum for almost every ill : to ease childbirth , as a remedy for cancer , even as a laxative . Spanish colonists liked to rub the waxy , colorless oil on their mustaches . Last week a panel of National Research Council scientists reported that the jojoba bean may also be a panacea for the endangered sperm whale . <P> The giant sea mammals ( up to 60 ft. in length ) are relentlessly hunted for the exceptionally fine oil that can be extracted from their tissue and head cavities . Sperm-whale oil and the waxy substance separated from it-spermaceti - are resistant to high temperatures and pressures , and have been used in such varied processes as coating paper and fabrics , manufacturing cosmetics , soaps and candles , cold-rolling steel and lubricating automatic car transmissions , watches and other precision machinery . In an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in late 1970 the U.S. banned the importation of their oil . Even though other nations , notably the U.S.S.R. and Japan , continued to hunt the whales , the U.S. stockpile of the oil began to dwindle alarmingly , and manufacturers argued that there was no adequate substitute . <P> In fact , there was . In the 1930s , Robert A. Greene , a chemist at the University of Arizona 's College of Agriculture , noted that there was a remarkable chemical similarity between jojoba-bean oil and that of the sperm whale . Other researchers confirmed his findings ; the university 's Office of Arid Lands Studies still publishes an occasional bulletin called Jojoba Happenings to promote cultivation of the bean . But until recently sperm-whale oil was still plentiful , and efforts to substitute jojoba oil did not attract much commercial enthusiasm . <P> Economic Boost . In its new report , the Washington panel laments that neglect . It emphasizes that jojoba-bean oil could " probably be used as a sperm oil substitute for the complete range of uses . " Furthermore , the report notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic boost for the impoverished Indian reservations in the Southwest . The hardy , long-lived ( up to 200 years ) shrubs could readily be cultivated in desert land that has until now been almost totally unproductive . The panel conceded that the startup costs for a jojoba plantation would be high , but after the plants reach maturity in five years , they would begin to pay off handsomely , even as they were contributing to the salvation of the great sperm whale .
