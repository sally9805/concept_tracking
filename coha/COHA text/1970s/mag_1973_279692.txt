SECURITY on our campuses is the No. 1 educational problem today - not curriculums or new approaches to teaching , " says California Educator Eugene McAdoo . " You ca n't teach anything unless you have an atmosphere without violence . " <P> Few urban educators would disagree . Armed robberies , assaults and purse snatchings occur with depressing regularity in many-though obviously not all-of the nation 's city schools . Declares Los Angeles ' Principal Sid Thompson : " For teachers and students alike , the issue unfortunately is no longer learning but survival . " His own high school is known as " Fort Crenshaw " because of its steel mesh fence , armed guards and classroom doors that lock from the inside . Not even such Draconian measures have left Crenshaw free of violence . Last month a gang climbed over the fence , tore off a student 's jacket and severely beat him . <P> An especially alarming aspect of school violence is the growing number of assaults upon teachers in many cities across the country . New York , for example , recorded 541 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Detroit averages 25 assaults on teachers every month . The result is that many teachers are afraid of their students and incapable of imposing the discipline needed for teaching . <P> Far more often , however , it is the students themselves who are the victims . School officials blame most of these incidents on intruders , often dropouts who return to prey on their former schoolmates . They lie in wait in school toilets to shake down students for their lunch money , roam the halls and playgrounds extorting and terrorizing . <P> Such violence reflects to a large extent the jungle of the slums , for it is there that the schools with the worst problems are located . For an addict needing money for his next fix , a student with lunch money is an obvious target . Gang fights frequently spill over into school buildings . Vandalism alone costs schools $200 million a year nationally . Violent acts are often so seemingly meaningless that they defy reason . Outside Intermediate School 155 in New York 's desolate South Bronx , a youngster was nearly stomped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop . <P> Increasingly , students in such schools are arming themselves with knives and cheap handguns . " In the kids ' eyes , a gun is an equalizer , " says one teacher . At Los Angeles ' Compton High School a 17-year-old student , armed with a gun and a knife , demanded money from a 16-year-old . The victim drew his own gun and shot the extortionist dead . <P> One answer to the rampant violence is to place guards in the schools . New York City is training 1,200 security guards for its 95 high schools . Chicago has increased its guard force of off-duty policemen from 200 to 490 in the past three years . It now assigns up to eight men to each school , where they inspect locks on doors and check student identification cards , which bear not only the student 's photograph and class schedule but are color coded to show his lunch hour . As a result , Chicago has reported an 11% drop in assaults . Philadelphia has assigned 61 uniformed policemen to problem high schools , organized an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a similar drop in school violence and crime .
