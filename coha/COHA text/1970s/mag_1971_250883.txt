Even before its hefty wage settlement early this month , the steel industry was braced for a slack third quarter . Most big customers are still using up the steel they stockpiled as a hedge against a possible strike . Nonetheless , steelmakers , led by U.S. Steel , announced an 8% across-the-board price increase to take effect on Dec. 1 . Behind the scenes , though , hard-pressed companies began seeking sales by offering discounts-urging automakers to sign orders for cold-rolled steel before the increase and take delivery afterward at current prices . Last week an open rift developed within the industry when Bethlehem Steel , the second largest producer , said it was deferring until Feb. 1 its increase on cold-rolled steel used in making auto bodies . <P> By extending the time allowed customers to buy steel at the cheaper rates , Bethlehem was only making public essentially the same offer that some other steelmakers were granting with their discounts .
