The youngest owner in the major leagues was watching his team in a preseason game last month when Atlanta Braves Pitcher Adrian Devine balked with two men on . As the runners casually advanced , R.E . ( " Ted " ) Turner III , 37 , jumped to his feet . " Where are those guys going ? " he demanded . " The pitcher balked , " someone explained . Turner sat down . Then , after a moment of silence , he asked : " What the hell is a balk ? " <P> Andy Messersmith 's new employer may have something to learn about baseball , but he is already an expert on winning . After inheriting his father 's outdoor billboard agency when he was 24 , Turner built it into a million-dollar communications business , with TV stations in Atlanta and Charlotte , N.C. that mainly broadcast syndicated shows , sports events and movies . He also races sailboats well enough to have been named Yachtsman of the Year in 1970 and 1973 , and to have skippered Mariner in the 1974 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than lose " is his shipboard motto , and crews can attest that " Terrible Ted " means it . But Turner does not look for easy victories . He bought American Eagle , a proven failure in two America 's Cup trials , refitted her and skippered her to a series of impressive victories in the rugged Southern Ocean Racing Conference in 1970 . <P> What he did with Eagle , he will try to do with the Braves , who finished three games out of last place in the National League 's Western division last season . Turner bought the team in January for $10 million , partly , he said , because he was tired of Atlanta being called " Losersville , U.S.A. " Now he introduces himself on a local TV commercial as " the frightened new owner of the Atlanta Braves . " Dry land athletic competition may be a new game for Turner , but of one thing he is certain : " The principles in sailing and baseball are the same . You go at it to win , and you do so with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bill Veeck could not have said it better . <P> In spirit , at least , baseball 's youngest owner is surely not Turner , but Veeck . At 62 , Veeck has returned from the baseball purgatory to which he was assigned when he gave up the White Sox in 1961 . Prior to that , he owned the Cleveland Indians , the Milwaukee Brewers ( when they were a minor league team ) , the St. Louis Browns , and the hearts of fans . When it comes to promotion-and rocking boats-he is baseball 's alltime MVP . American League owners tried hard to keep Veeck locked out of baseball last December by imposing stiff conditions on his offer to purchase the all but bankrupt White Sox for $10 million . <P> They failed , and already have suffered the consequences . In March , when the owners voted 23 to 1 to lock the spring training camps , the one was Veeck . ( " That 's the usual tally , " he says . ) A few days later , he unveiled the new White Sox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veeck ( he lost his leg as a result of a 1943 war wound ) choreographed some Bicentennial foofaraw and greeted his crowd as the fife player in a fetching patriotic ceremony . Marching across the field with him were Business Manager Rudie Schaffer on drum and stern Sox Manager Paul Richards bearing the flag , both as resplendent as Veeck in Revolutionary War costumes .
