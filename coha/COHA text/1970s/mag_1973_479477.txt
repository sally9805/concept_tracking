STROLLING DOWN TO the Carlton Hotel beach , sufficiently early to claim a place in the sun on the first morning of the Cannes Film Festival , I immediately espied a hirsute belly boiling out of the sands , knobby arms glistening with suntan oii , thumbs hooked into plaid Bermuda shorts that caught the belly necessarily low , yet punishingly tight all the same . The man 's face was at once pouchy but rutted with wrinkles , cupped by a spreading silver foil reflector aimed at the sun . Unmistakably Bronstein . No sooner did I settle onto my own mattress than the gnats began to buzz around him . Three overeager Englishmen , Wardour Street hustlers , deep into skin flicks . " What have you got for us this P. year ? " Bronstein sang out . Attache cases snap open , brochures fly out . " Well , we 've got some werewolves , a monster , but no tits . That market 's played out , you know . " " I 'm thinking of buying Homo Vampire , " Bronstein allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ; they had heard . " Who do you think made it ? The Germans , naturally . It 's all about a fag witch , " Bronstein continued , disgusted , " who faints at the sight of blood . " Though Bronstein now buys exploitation films for American distribution , he was once an independent producer . When I last saw him , some six months earlier , he was ensconced in his Belgravia mews flat , the furnishings out of the most modish King 's Road antique shops , provisions laid on by Harrod 's Food Emporium. a Bentley idling in the garage , a tax-proof portfolio fattening in a Swiss account , the number swallowed and committed to memory , and the latest Mrs. Bronstein not only a pleasure to look at but his youngest and most agreeable wife yet . He seemed the most enviable of middle-aged men . But Bronstein 's a wreck . The world he took so long to knit is unraveling again . Bronstein 's one of a brood of show-business Americans now nesting in London . Years ago , serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three Stooges were not unknown to him ; neither were the Ritz Brothers . In the early Fifties , he began to produce , albeit only for Monogram , but Metro was making sweet noises . Things were looking up . Forearming himself , intent on self-improvement , Bronstein devoured the Great Books ; he acquired a taste for claret , and learned to prefer Bach to Gershwin . Then , for the first time , things flew apart . Senator Joe McCarthy led his vigilantes into town , and Bronstein , hitherto a professional yes-man , a fully accredited forelock-toucher , stiffened . With nothing to gain , everything to lose , something in his Brownsville background would n't yield . Memories of the Spanish Civil War , maybe , or his father demonMordecai Richler , a Canadian novetist , is the author of Cocksure and Saint Urbain 's Horseman , strating . To his own astonishment , Bronstein refused to talk to the Committee on Un-American Activities . He would not name names . Driven out of the industry , blacklisted , he packed his wife and children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but decidedly impecunious novelist , first met him in 1954 . I shall always cherish Bronstein as he was then , adrift , stunned , even as he propelled me past the Hampstead Public Library . " You 've got an education , " he said . " Co in there , to the stacks , and find me something . Have you ever been in a library ? It 's a goddamn gold mine . All those books in the public domain . But you 've got to know what to reach for . " Bronstein , in those days , was prepared to start on the bottom rung again , maybe riding the TV serial mill . But in London , lo and behold , he was no longer scorned as a shlock artist : instead , he was celebrated as a producer for all seasons . Other blacklisted men , Academy Award-winning directors and writers , began to shove things his way . And over the years Bronstein 's name came to be associated with quality pictures , festival candidates , Academy nominees . Sir Laurence Olivier 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he waved to David Niven in the Mirabelle , Niven waved back . Once , at the White Elephant , Richard Burton actually stopped at his table . Then , suddenly , brutally , the quality films Bronstein took such immense pride in , each one elegantly made , flopped one after another . The audience had gone elsewhere , Bronstein , taking to Valium , threw his own money into a motorcycle movie a year too late and then surfaced with a love story a year too soon . Meanwhile , the art-house cinema that had once flattered him with a season was showing a Golden Age of Comedy anthology ? the Ritz Brothers , the Three Stooges , the crap he had overcome ? and packing them in , yes , packing them in . And now Bronstein was afraid to make a move , any move , because one more mistake and he was out . N OON . EVEN THOSE WHO DID N'T stagger out of the Casino until 4:00 A.M. have now risen to their restorative glasses of hot water , honey , and lemon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquillity I , and driven their sagging bodies to the waterside . The action . The Carlton Hotel beach is now littered with baking . filmmakers . Rex Reed has been seen . Groucho 's arrival is rumored . Harry Saltzman , it is promised , will soon appear . Bronstein , suddenly mindful of his burning belly , rises , shifts to the shelter of his umbrella , and flops down on another mattress . He is now part of a group , among them Bernie Lindman , who ventures , " Hey , what about a remake of Gone With the Wind , told from the shvartzeh point of view ? You know , the slave market , whippings , interracial screwing , the whole shmcar . Scarlett is kinky . " " Are you making fun of me ? " Bronstein demands . " To tell you the truth , I do n't know . I 'm not sure . But it 's one hell of a market now . " They are joined by Schwartz , who has just been to see Mona , a hard-core porn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with close-ups of genitalia . " They 're actually showing that stuff in drive-ins now , " Schwartz says . " You 're looking at it and getting it at the same time . How are you going to top that , baby ? " Like the kangaroo or , more appropriately , perhaps , the blue whale , film producers are now an endangered species . In their beleaguered world , nothing is surefire anymore . Neither a big-budget blockbuster adorned by the most dazzling constellation of stars , nor a cheap but explicit skin flick . The trouble is that nothing is box-office sacred anymore , not even the frontal nude . Gone , gone forever , are the fat years , when to shoot a film . any film , was , for openers , to cream $200.000 off the top of the budget . A diminishing form of wildlife , increasingly starved for sustenance , the independent producers have been driven from traditionally green pastures by television , by the unaccountable tastes of the ungrateful young , and , to an even larger extent , their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rome , Hollywood , Paris , and London , delaying payment on the long-distance phone bill , they have been sustained by miracles proven ( last year The Godfather , this year Last Tango in Paris ) and the dizzying dream of connecting in Cannes in May . For if absolutely nothing but chicanery is assured anymore , then the Cannes Film Festival is still where the producers come to spawn in the springtime . Those who can afford it sink into luxury suites in the Carlton , the Majestic , or Antibes ' Hotel du Cap , and the others , the hustlers who flew the Atlantic economy class , toting reels of unsold film under their arms , hunker down in nondescript pensiones . Ostensibly they have all come to watch the films being shown officially at the festival , but actually to reassure each other , spitball , and , above all , buy and sell . And why not ? As Gilbert de Goldschmidt , director of Unifrance , the promotional organization for French films , put it , " All through history peasants who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " More than 400 films are screened during the festival , most of them porn , hard and soft , shown out of prize competition in back-street cinemas , distribution rights readily available . The real marketplace , by common consent , is a Victorian wedding cake of a hotel , the Carlton , baking on the seafront . It spills out of the churning lobby , on to the overflowing terrace , running down to the beach and the yachts moored beyond . The independent producer approaches it armed with hope , appetite , optioned screenplays , and rented starlets ; he comes to meet and haggle with distributors , exhibitors , and potential investors from every continent , assuring them , hand over his heart , that he , arid he alone , has the biggie going into production , and will surface as next year 's Godfather 's godfather . Climb on board today , baby , or cry tomorrow . M ORNING AGAIN ; and scuttering from table to table are the flacks , dispensing the most coveted luncheon , party , and film invitations to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Modishly braless hookers , nippies by Eversharp , are rooted here and there , the empty coffee cups before them unfailingly lipstick-stained . Occasionally , a cardinal deigns to appear , say , seemingly benign , chubby Harry Saltzman , begetter of the James Bond films ; Saltzman 's eyes do not dart as he sails between tables , raining smiles on acolytes , blessing less fortunate men . He is immediately embraced by a director with an official entry in the festival . " Harry Saltzman is a great producer , the greatest , " he says again and again , " And I do n't say that just because he 's here . " Saltzman , not inclined to disagree , settles into an empty table , waiting for the world , his inheritance , to come to him ; and , within minutes , lie is indeed besieged . " Would you believe , " he says , " that it took me twenty minutes to get from the front desk to this table ? Everybody stops rne , they 've got a deal . And within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be offered stars , scripts , directors , armies in Yugoslavia , studios in Tel Aviv , fivemillion-dollar co-production deals . And at the end of it what will I have ? A stack of hills this high ; nobody even picks up his on coffee tab . " Saltzman recognizes these are economy-minded days , even for him . " I make no more seven-limousine pictures . You know , " he adds , shaking his head , astonished at himself , on the last Bond picture , I used my own car . " Which was when Norm Flecker , a fringe producer , bore down on us . Flecker endeared himself to me years ago in London when he took an option on Evelyn Waugh 's Scoop and was sufficiently intrepid to commission the novelist to write a screen treatment of the book for him . Waugh accepted his several thousand pounds gleefully and , in return , sent Flecker a treatment as comprehensive as it was unique : the Penguin edition of his novel pasted up on postcards . For Hecker , his briefcase bulging with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance of the year . All through the punishing winter he has been humiliated and scorned , unable to get past Warner 's front office or even get the assistant head of overseas production at MGM on the phone , and now , suddenly ? look , look ? everybody 's here on the terrace , tantalizingly vulnerable . unable to hide behind secretaries . Uninvited and uninsultable , his skin thicker than bear hide , he moves in on them one by one . WIHE FIRST CANNES FILM FESTIVAL , I in 1939 , was conceived as a democratic response to the older festival in Venice , then thought to be controlled by Mussolini . It was to be a glittering affair , charged with glamour . MGM dispatched a shipload of stars . In the pre-opening ceremonies , Norma Shearer and George Raft danced in the streets . But the festival , actually scheduled to open on September 1 , 1939 , was upstaged by a bigger , more dramatic production to the north ? the Nazi invasion of Poland ? and did n't get under way again until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including that of Michelangelo Antonioni , who showed L'Avventura there in 1960 , and Godard , who was there the same season with Breathless . Once , stars used to adorn the seafront cafes , pursued everywhere by fans , and fabled champagne-and-caviar parties were the rule . In 1956 , an unknown starlet flung herself at Robert Mitchum , shedding her bikini top , and her photograph , a shocker at the time , traveled round the world . But on last season 's beaches topless girls abounded , hardly rating a second glance . " There are no more stars , not in the old and accepted sense , " said the festival 's most seasoned publicist . " Robert Redford is here , you know . I watched him sitting on the terrace for maybe an hour and not one person came over to ask for his autograph . " No more stars and , Harry Saltzman laments , no more showmanship . But , as recently as 1969 , Commonwealth United , a film company backed by Investors Overseas Services ? and buried with it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threw a lavish party for hundreds at the casino , presenting all the men with gold Dunhill lighters and all the ladies with expensive evening bags , one hundred dollars worth of chips thoughtfully tucked inside . Most of the ladies , rather sensibly , did n't play , but cashed in their chips instead ? a harbinger of things to come , perhaps . For last May most of the parties were distinctly on the chintzy side . Nothing more than vin ordinaire and cold fish salad at the luncheon for Jeanne Moreau . From United Artists , at their cocktail party , not Beluga caviar but sliced eggs or tomatoes on crackers . MGM did n't entertain , Columbia passed , and Paramount , the Chosen Studio , saw fit to send forth to Cannes only its tabernacles , white-on-black ceiling-high placards mounted on pillars in the Carlton lobby , saying " The Godfather is now a phenomenon . " So it was left to Samuel Z. Arkoff , the ebullient head of American International Pictures , with Frogs jumpin ' in nine-house multiples and Spider Woman yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filet , and strawberries with cream . " Last year we had more than fifty Arabs here , " Arkoff said , " but I did n't invite any this time . I 've got nothing against them . But if you sell distribution rights to your film in Lebanon , it ends up playing in Jordan , Libya , and Egypt as well . They 're some crowd . " After twenty-five years , the festival differs from a shoe salesmen 's convention only in that it is more subdued , without funny hats or door prizes , the money tighter ? something even the hookers , who would n't accept credit cards , grasped as early as the fifth day , when they abandoned the impecunious producers for the cash-paying sailors of the Sixth Fleet . Of course there 's still the competition for the Grand Prix International , but that 's no more than window dressing now , like the small cigar store that fronts for the larger bookie 's office behind . Yesteryear 's glamour was grotesquely parodied last May by the frequent appearance on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver-wigged , wearing a frilly bolero , Pucci-type floral slacks , and platform shoes . Encouraged by the paparazzi , he pirouetted along the Carlton pier , using it as a model 's runway , pausing here and there to mock the poses usually affected by bikini-clad starlets. " nROM/NENT ON THE TERRACE at all hours arc the so-called distress merchants , those men as grim as they are bronzed , who offer new methods , just this side of usury , of financing films . One of the most thrusting , Alberti , maintains offices in the capitals of three continents . Producers , rejected by all the major studios , come to him with projects . He listens , lie nods , he makes notes on his scratch 38 pad . The producer says he 's got a director , a star , and a honey of a script , but no money . He must have a million two . Alberti , if he favors the project , phones Athens , Tokyo , Paris , Toronto , and Madrid . From his agents in each country he extracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finished film in their territory , say $50,000 from Greece , $100,000 from Japan , and so on . He delivers the notes to the producer , less 18 percent , his cut for raising the money . The producer , grasping the notes in his hot hand , then breaks for the bank , where the notes are usually discounted for another 10 percent . But he 's in business , shooting a film . Likely as not , flying over Geneva , he shakes the budget bag , just to see how much will stick to his numbered account , and in the end produces his film for only $900,000 . He will charge a year 's office overhead , his mistress 's new car , his father-in-law 's heart specialist , and his son 's orthodontia bill to the production . He cajoles his director into taking only $25,000 up front against a whacking share of profits that he knows will never materialize , and his star , if he 's French , may work for nothing , acquiring all rights to the film in France in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financed through this method , beginning with Shalako , a Western starring Sean Connery and Brigitte Bardot , and running through T he Assassination of Trotsky with Richard Burton , have done poorly at the box office . Even so , the initial investors , the men who forked out for the territories in advance , were probably in need of a tax write-off . Must likely , they have also visited the sets , and now boast photographs of themselves actually shaking hands with Richard Burton or sitting at the very same table as Brigitte Bardot . Alberti has creamed his 18 percent off the top , the producer is hardly out of pocket , the director and actors have earned something . Everybody 's worked . Another distress merchant , Seigal , a febrile American who lives in London , has succeeded in making a large number of films and selling the territories in advance , but all of them have been critical failures as well as box-office losers . He is grudgingly admired , if only because , as Bronstein put it , he climbs from failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that 's the case , he 's not the least bit fazed . " I 'm a great promoter of money , " he told me . " Each time out , I put together a very impressive package . " " Yes , yes , " I protested , " but none of your films has earned money . " " Oh yeah , well look here , even before I had my own company , when I was still producing for one of the majors , I made two losers in one year , big ones , and I still came out $450,000 ahead . There 's more than one way to skin a cat , you know . " The distributors , it must be said , do not sit on the Carlton terrace primarily to invest in films that may or may not be made , but rather to buy a finished product . The most astute , whether they be from South America or Greece , are in persistent quest of a locomotive , a proven box office winner , for which they will overpay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagons to it , cheaply bought duds , which they will force-feed to cinema chains who want the big one . Something else . The producer , who cheats gleefully , is gleefully swindled in turn by most distributors . In a typical deal , a distributor will buy a film for , say , Brazil , signing a check for $10,000 against a guaranteed further $40,000 to come out of receipts . No sooner has he issued the check than lie phones his bank and puts a stop payment on it . Then , still on the line to Brazil , he hustles various cinema chains , trying to off-load the film he has just purchased . If he succeeds , making a profit , he will ultimately let his check go through : if riot , not . But the seller knows , without a doubt , that he will never see his further 810,000 . " Then why does he insist on it ? " I asked Harry Saltzman . " Because when he returns to his hackers , and they shout why did you sell so cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but look , there 's another forty to come . He takes his contract to the bank and uses the forty for collateral . They 'll advance him more money against it to finance his next film . And the secret of this business is to have a new film going on the floor before your last disaster has been released . That way you can go on for years . " Such convoluted dealings are especially demanding of the fledgling filmmaker , but some make it , among them the young Canadian director of Cannibal Girls ( " They eat men ! " ) , which he sold before the festival was over . Buck Dane , London production head of an American exploitation film company , walked out , disgusted , after twenty minutes ' viewing , but he returned another day with Samuel Z. Arkoff , who bought American distribution rights . " Let me tell you , " Dane said , " that kid is something . He sat with Arkoff , an old pro . The boy 's only 26 years old . He talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch . Those things you do n't learn at school in Toronto . His film is awful , but he 'll go far . You wait and see . " FINALLY , THERE WERE SOME stars 1. in Cannes last May , the real McCoy , but they were all grand old men , none of whom had films showing in competition : John Huston , Groucho , and Alfred Hitchcock . No sooner did Huston loom on the terrace , a compelling , craggy-laced man in a white safari suit , pursued by celebrity-starved photographers , than lesser men thrust themselves at him , smiling not at the director , but into the photographer 's flashing bulbs , only to have their faces clipped out of the next morning 's Nice-Matin . Late one night I ran into a screenwriter at the Carlton bar . " Listen here , " he said , " even if they do go to cassettes , somebody will still have to produce , direct , and write them , do n't you think ? " On the last day of the festival , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but far from pretty , suddenly shed her bikini top ? seemingly crazed ? arid raced to and fro , to and fro , on the Carlton pier for the benefit of the remaining photographers , no more than two or three . Even as the billboards and sales booths began to come down , carpenters hammering everywhere , Bronstein , his nose peeling , finally connected . He made a deal . He slipped a waiter ten francs and in return collected a wad of bar bills with which to pad his expense account . I had run into him earlier at the official French gala , where wristwatches had been presented to all the ladies . He had passed in and out of the reception twice , coming away with a watch each time . All in all , he was n't flying off empty-handed .
