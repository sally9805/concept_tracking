txt Bob Wainright was annoyed enough to be told he could n't do the job himself . But , to be charged $8 for simply pushing an ordinary electrical plug into a wall socket , was galling beyond words . And that was n't the end of the matter . When a few hours later an electric light bulb went out , it cost him another $8 to have it replaced by the " authorized electrician . " It 's incidents like this , increasingly common in several major metropolitan areas , that are about to m ... ke Mr. Wainright quit a job he loves . His business is to run display stands for various concerns at trade fairs throughout the United States . But union labor abuses are proving more than he can tolerate . Two doors to open . . . Howard Vermette 's experience has been no better . An Indiana manufacturer of lifting equipment , he arrived at Chicago 's Arnpitheatre one evening to ready his display booth for the show 's opening next day . In effect all he had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready . He did just that ? an operation that took barely a minute to perform . And that 's when his problems began . A union steward quickly pointed out that he had deprived a carpenter of his rightful work ; that even though he had performed the task , he would have to pay the requisite fee ? $25 for a minimum of one hour 's labor at overtime rates . When Mr. Vermette refused , his electricity was cut off for the duration of the show . The carpenter , it seems , " complained to the electrician who promptly removed the extension cord supplying electricity to the booth , " says Mr. Vermette . Complaints to the show 's organizers brought forth a now familiar response : " We are powerless to do anything . The unions run this hall " Sound incredible ? It 's commonplace at trade fairs Flood of letters When Mr Vermette disclosed some of these abuses in the magazine NAM Report  --  a monthly magazine put out by the National Association of Manufacturers ? he was showered with letters from other exhibitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one exhibitor had to hire an electrician to disconnect a plug , push the cord through a small hole in the booth , and reconnect the plug on the other side . " It was a 10-minute job , " he said . The result . a $65 bill . Another had his exhibit delivered to the exhibition hall face down . He was charged as follows to have it placed in an upright position : 11/2 hours rigger foreman , $18 : 1 hour each for three assistants , $33 ; two millwrights at $9 50 an hour , $19 ; 11/2 hours fork-lift truck , $12 . Total cost $91.50 for an operation which the exhibitor says " took less than one-half hour . " Then there was the six-pound package shipped from Chicago to Cleveland for 70 cents Yet it cost S4 for union labor to move it 500 feet from the receiving dock to the display booth . The complaints continue " We were expected to pay $27 to install two wing nuts and have one electric plug pushed into an outlet . . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up a booth that one man can set up in 20 minutes . " We could n't even wipe the fingerprints off our display " The cost : $9 for a once-over-lightly job by a " helper " Exhibitor fights hack Many companies buckle under to the demands . As they point out , it , is n't easy to throw away a $3,000 investment in floor space . But one exhibitor did rebel recently . He refused to hire a carpenter for an unnecessary task and threatened to walk out despite the cost to his company . The show sponsors pleaded with him , then finally paid for the carpenter themselves . Meanwhile , increasing numbers of exhibitors threaten to boycott " captured " halls ( those controlled by local unions ) in the future . Indeed , one show , run by the American Dietetic Association , was moved from Detroit to Cleveland last year because a number of exhibitors threatened to boycott the Detroit center . ? Cities where union abuse is most prevalent are Detroit , New York , Chicago , and Philadelphia ? " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , we know the major trouble spots , " adds another . " All we need to do is boycott them to get the shows moved . " Moreover , he thinks that will be the trend in the future " unless union attitudes change radically . "
