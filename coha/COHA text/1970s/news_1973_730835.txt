txt Suspended in space outside Skylab , 270 miles above the earth , Capt . Charles Conrad Jr . whacked a battery regulator , with a hammer ? and symbolized the entire mission so far . Immediately a regulator jumped into life ? just as Skylab itself began to operate after a string of initial setbacks was overcome by ingenuity and elbow-grease from crew and ground controllers alike . In fact , the second and third missions in the orbiting space station now are possible . The second crew is to be launched July 27 , and the third toward the end of the year . The missions are scheduled to last 56 days . As the astronauts begin packing up for their journey home , Skylab managers , doctors , scientists and engineers have begun the process of evaluating this first mission . Dr. Robert Parker , a Skylab mission scientist , reported that despite the initial overheating and lack of power problems a majority of the originally planned scientific activities have been carried out ? although many In an unconventional manner . On the final space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition to repairing the faulty regulator , retrieved valuable film from the solar telescopes . They opened the hatch 45 minutes early and completed their assigned jobs in half the scheduled time . Compared with the two previous emergency space walks , it was simply routine . On their first space walk , astronaut Weitz made an unsuccessful attempt to free a set of solar panels caught against the side of the workshop . On the second mission , astronaut Conrad // *Successful Skylab crew packs up for sprint home // and Comdr . Joseph P. Kerwin , after a three-hour effort , managed to break the solar panels free with cutters , rope , and brute strength . The main focus of this first mission has been on the crew . Medical experiments to determine the long-term effects of weightlessness were given first priority . About 90 percent of the medical objectives were fulfilled , Dr. Parker reports . These experiments have recorded several effects . The astronauts , when spun on a rotating chair , have not experienced any of the feelings of nausea which doctors expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drop in blood pressure , was noticed when the astronauts pedal on the bicycle-like ergometer . None of these reactions has affected the crew 's ability to function in weightlessness . At first the crew found that riding the ergometer was much more difficult in weightlessness than in earth practices , but , they solved the problem by bracing their heads against the lab ceiling while pedaling . Also the three adapted almost effortlessly to moving about . " Eierybody has his own way of going , " astronaut Conrad commented . " We enjoy zinging around up here . If you want to stand on the ceiling for a while , soon everything looks perfectly natural that way . " Experiments recorded When the astronauts return June 22 they will bring with them the tape and film record of the scientific experiments they have performed . Although scientists will not know the , quality of the data until they have it in hand , they have formed impressions of how sucCessfiil the mission has been . ' Mood in the earth-resources rooms is one of happy anticipation . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth-watching eyes for detecting and managing resources on the ground . " If the data is any good , we feel that we 've had a pretty good mission , " a scientist notes . Earth-bound scientists got almost 90 percent of the crew time originally scheduled for earth-resources viewing and 60 percent actual observations ? a great deal more than was hoped for in the early days of the mission . The solar-physics experimenters ? attempting to put together the most comprehensive picture of the sun yet ? are concerned about the quality of some of the data they will get back . Although 81 percent of the scheduled solar observations have been completed a problem has cropped up with the data that is being recorded while the space laboratory is out of radio contact and later relayed to Houston . If the problem is on the ground , a majority of the data can be recovered . But if the problem is on Skylab Itself , much will be lost . Still the principal investigators are looking forward to some " really meaningful science " on the second mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have the astronauts been able to do the bulk of the scheduled investigations . But officials feel that their efforts will smooth the way for the second and third crews .
