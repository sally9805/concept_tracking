Buying the traditional wristwatch for June graduates was once a relatively simple chore calling for little more than a choice of styles and prices . No longer . Whole new types of watches have hit the $3-billion-a-year world market in the frenzied competition to lure buyers . Some of the new models are called " automatic , " meaning selfwinding ; others are battery-powered and are variously called " electronic , " " solid state " and " quartz crystal . " Still another timekeeping development is about to reach the jewelry store . Early next year Longines will begin selling a " liquid crystal digital " ( LCD ) watch that is battery-powered and displays the hour , minute , second and date in digits on a miniaturized TV-like screen . The cost : about $300 . <P> The intensifying war of the watches involves the technological and marketing savvy of companies in three nations : Switzerland , Japan and the U.S. As usual , the Swiss dominate , with export sales of $650 million last year , a total that amounted to nearly four-fifths of world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese , whose watches generally are of somewhat lower quality and command lower prices than the Swiss . Last year Japanese watchmakers accounted for $106 million in exports , and their sales jumped 10% in Europe and 50% in the U.S. Meanwhile , U.S. manufacturers , led by Timex and Bulova , produced 20 million watches last year , but sold only a fraction of them abroad . <P> A Minute a Year . The hottest battle is being fought over the quartz watch , which keeps time by the vibrations of a quartz crystal . It is judged to be the most accurate timepiece now on the market , losing or gaining only a minute a year , compared with one or two minutes a week for most other watches . Bulova introduced the first marketable quartz-crystal watch in 1970 , but its $1,350 cost was prohibitive . Late last year Bulova brought out an improved and cheaper version , the $395 Accuquartz , believed by many to be the best quartz watch on the market . By then Timex had begun marketing a quartz-crystal watch for $125 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month Japan 's Seiko brought its three quartz timepieces to the U.S. , the cheapest selling for $450 . This week Benrus will introduce the first quartz watch for women . Among the Swiss companies , Omega , Piaget , Girard Perregaux and Longines are selling quartz watches at prices from $495 to $2,250 . <P> The quartz watch is a departure from the familiar windup and " automatic " watches . Gone are the mainsprings and most of the gears and cogs that keep a watch ticking . In their place is a single tiny quartz bar that vibrates when charged by electricity from a mercury-oxide battery the size of an aspirin tablet . Ground to the proper thickness , quartz has the inherent capability of vibrating at a precise and predictable rate-32,769 times per second in the case of the Bulova Accuquartz.
