Coast to coast , Carter and his troops try to plug in the President 's plan <P> When Jimmy Carter declared " the moral equivalent of war " against energy waste last spring , every member of his Cabinet was issued the bureaucrat 's equivalent of the infantryman 's M-16 rifle : a blue loose-leaf notebook loaded with proposed speeches and pointed statistics dramatizing the need for the President 's " National Energy Plan . " But as Carter 's attention drifted to other subjects , the books gathered dust on secretarial shelves . No more . The energy program is in real trouble in Congress , and General Jimmy has ordered his troops to hit those blue books - and the road-in a final blitz to win the energy war . <P> As the Cabinet chiefs fanned out across the country , striving to wedge their energy appeals into long-scheduled speeches on other subjects , their boss led the way . All week the President went all out , barraging congressional leaders , key legislators , consumer and labor representatives with his energy pleas . <P> <P> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ westward trip into a campaign to inspire grass roots support for his program . In Michigan , Iowa , Nebraska , Colorado and California , Carter seized every chance he could find to hammer home the point that nothing less than the economic and military security of the nation rested on the fate of his energy legislation . He also placed his own prestige on the line , declaring at one point : " I have equated the energy policy legislation with either success or failure of my first year in office as a leader of our country in domestic affairs . " Despite specific dissatisfactions and some demonstrations , the President was given rousing recep tions by audiences from Detroit to Los Angeles . <P> Although both the President and his Cabinet put in a lot of gas mileage in their nationwide speechmaking , all their energy actually was directed toward influencing critical events back in Washington . There , amid the chandeliered splendor of the Senate Caucus Room , an unwieldy 43-member conference committee of Senators and Congressmen met for the first time last week . Their challenge was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House , which gave Carter almost everything , and by the Senate , which has not yet completed its work but seems bent on giving Carter almost nothing but the back of its hand . <P> The differences between House and Senate are immense . " It 's horrendous , " said Democratic Senator Henry Jackson of the task the conference committee faces . " But I think it will turn out all right . " <P> The Administration finally was working hard to achieve an outcome that would be successful from its perspective . Aides to Secretary of State Cyrus Vance could not suppress their laughter when their boss , appearing on TV 's Meet the Press , stood a question on its head in order to insert a plug for Carter 's energy program . Asked whether the President planned to visit Saudi Arabia during his nine-nation trip next month , Vance fairly pounced . <P>
