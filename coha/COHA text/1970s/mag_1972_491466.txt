qwq coming . At the foreign exchange shop , where luxuries are sold for hard currency , the excitement was more than clerks could contain . A crowd too large to get in the door pushed and shoved for admittance . With intense concentration , Mongolians clustered around the American , who was buying nothing more exciting than orange juice to take to the Gobi . As each transaction was completed , the watchers turned to the next purchaser . They had come to rub shoulders with the strangers from the end of the earth , and to hear them speak . At the hotel that night , exuberant Mongolians sang and danced with their visitors . Their friendliness was contagious , and the Americans soon were trading toasts with a group of East European acrobats on tour and a large group of Russians on holiday . The Russians recalled that they had helped the Mongolians win their independence from China in 1921 , and averred they were ready to fight to maintain it . The promise and the threat lie in the emptiness of the land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in size among the countries of the world ; in population , it ranks less than one hundredth . Larger than France , Italy , Spain and half of Germany combined , Mongolia has only 1,290,000 inhabitants  --  two per square mile . As a result , vast resources are undeveloped and the Mongolians lack the manpower to defend their far-reaching frontiers . The Chinese built the Great Wall to hold back the Golden Horde of Mongols , but the centuries have reversed the roles . While the Chinese multiplied , Mongolia was robbed of much of its population by war , emigration and disease . The People 's Republic celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 1971 , haunted by fear that sooner or later the eight hundred million Chinese would explode across their border . Soviet troops now guard the 2,980 miles of border Mongolia shares with Red China . Soviet missiles are in place along a line equivalent to the mileage between New York and Los Angeles . In return for this protection , Mongolia is in danger of losing its historic raison d ' ? tre as a buffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , the Mongolians are making great effortsto improve their relations with China , and they go to incredible extremes to play down the Russian presence . Aboard planes and from train windows , foreigners see Russian soldiers . But the only uniformed Russians in Ulan Bator belong to a construction battalion . And heaven help the tourist who takes a picture of a Russian in or out of uniform ! Government secrecy has provoked guesses that there are as many as a million Soviet troops in Mongolia . The most conservative estimate is 100,000 , a force three times the size of the Mongolian Army . It is fire power though , not the number of troops , which absorbs the expert . And spy planes have counted the missiles . In their efforts to end the cold war between the United States and the Soviet Union , Americans looked for a safer topic than spy planes for conversation with the Russians . However , they found contention extends to a nest of dinosaur eggs in the State Musuem . The eggs , each about the size ofa baked potato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gobi by American scientist Roy Chapman Andrews . As a government press release says , " It 's hard to imagine " that a monster thirty yards long came out of an egg so small . Visitors are told about the American scientist and also about an American youth who stole one of the priceless eggs and was caught . And while Russians can believe an American stole a Mongolian treasure , they hooted at the notion that an American had discovered dinosaur eggs . Russians have found much larger eggs on the Gobi . The Smithson ian Institution in Washington , D.C. , resolved the mystery for this writer . The small eggs are those of a protoceratops , a dinosaur indeed , but only six feet long . ( Scientists have found dinosaurs as small as chickens . ) Americans find it extremely difficult to get visas for individual travel in Mongolia . The reason given by Mongolian officials is that Americans have had to be screened on an individual basis ever since the time of the egg-snatching incident . The obvious reason is that the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they do get visas , members of American tour groups are charged $90 a day for travel in Mongolia . For a single room , the price is $100 . Not only is this the highest price on earth for the accommodations provided , it is far in excess of what communists are charged for the same accommodations . At these prices , no more than one hundred Americans visited Mongolia in 1971 . In the recent absence of American competition , Soviet scientists have scored . Near Karakorum , the ancient capital of the Mongols , they have discovered tools used by man 500,000 years ago . Identical tools found in France support a theory that white tribes migrating from Mongolia discovered Europe  --  certainly the Mongols , not the Vikings , discovered America . The North American Indian crossed the Bering Strait from Mongolia , scientists agree . Soviet archeologists have determined that both Caucasian and Asiatic tribes lived and fought in Mongolia .

On a plane small enough to land in a pasture , we traveled to the spot , 200 miles west of Ulan Bator . Though there was no airport , more than a hundred Mongolians stood in a semicircle on the landing field  --  excited but at the same time , somehow , stolid  --  awaiting a glimpse of the Americans . Seventy-five percent of Mongols are Khalkha speaking , and they see themselves as one people . But the visitor can see at a glance the mixture of races . The people I saw ranged from a white-skinned ballet dancer with petite and pointed features to huge , thick-necked , red-skinned men with enormous cheekbones , grotesque by provincial Western standards . Our medical word " Mongolism " denotes a condition in Caucasians  --  for whom it is abnormal  --  where these physical traits are present .

They have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across roadless steppes . we were transported back to Karakorum to witness man 's capacity for self-destruction . It took three hours to cover a distance of twenty miles , and the trip was tooth shattering . The bus driver  --  singing Mongolian folk songs in a magnificent tenor  --  knew his way across grazing lands dotted with wildflowers in shades of pink , blue and purple . Outcroppings of pink and white stone studded hills covered with green trees on the side protected from the elements , bare on the other . A lone herdsman resplendent in red silk del watched over camels and horses . A palace supported by sixty-four columns , and a walled city with brick houses and a Christian church flourished at Karakorum at the time two envoys dispatched by Pope Innocent IV arrived in 1246 on a hopeless mission to restore peace . Mongols wearing white velvet greeted the Europeans in a white velvet pavilion , a far cry from the simple village of white yurts at the scene today .

In the 1880 's , the English-cis E. Younghusband wrote : " It e that the Chinese from the south ns from the north will , in course of time , gradually force the poor Mongols into the depth of the desert . " Even then the Mongols were in the middle . More than a million Mongols remain in China in the area known as Inner Mongolia , where they are fast being absorbed by the Chinese . Outer Mongolia has survived as the People 's Republic only because the Russians came to its assistance twice , first in the war of liberation and then with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan 's invasion of Mongolia in 1939 . The Mongols in that war fought as fiercely as ever . Westerners say they dug holes in the ice of rivers and lakes and dropped the captured invaders in to drown in the black depths . Each side suffered an estimated 80,000 killed and wounded before the Japanese gave up the push north and turned south to attack British and American bases . The Mongolians repaid their debt to Russia by fighting furiously against the Germans in Europe during World War 11 . Again , as in the days of Genghis Khan , they raced as far as the Danube . And in Vienna they revived their reputation for rape . The Allied powers had restored order by the time ! arrived in Vienna as a correspondent in 1946 . Still it took some courage to drive through the Soviet Zone of Austria because of the Mongolians stationed there . The woman alone depended on American GI 's to check her out , teletype ahead , trail her jeep and check her in to the safety of the American zone . After this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home territory the world 's fiercest warriors are the gentlest people on earth , particularly with children . One proud father obligingly lifted his little girl onto a camel to have her picture taken . But at her first whimper she came down again . Red China , during the fifties , was first to contribute substantial economic assistance to the Mongolians , an estimated $500 million worth . But when the communist cold war broke out in the sixties , Mongolia sided with Russia . The Mongolians have a saying : " You can not keep out the sun with your hand nor crush truth by force . " Yet their favorite folktale is about the champion liar , Khudalchi . For boasting of his prowess , he was called before the great Khan , who threatened to chop off his head unless he could tell seventy lies at once . The man to match him is a communist guide named Ichinkhorlo Tsendochia , " Mr. Stan " for short . He said there were no Russian soldiers on the Gobi . The first person we met when our small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from China 's Sinkiang province was a European hunter returning from the chase with his trophies , the thirtytwo-pound , curling horns of an argal and the sloping horns of an ibex , a fast-moving mountain goat . For this hunter , the great adventure was not in chasing the argal but in getting chased by Soviet patrols . He reported seeing numerous Russian patrols , while traveling by Land Rover in a radius of some 120 miles . With a hunter 's eye and the most powerful binoculars made in Germany , the European saw the Russians before they saw him . He was out of bounds , within fifty miles of the border , when a Soviet patrol caught up with him and turned him back . The hunter 's two guides to the goats were a different breed from the Ulan Bator communist , Mr. Stan , and they talked freely about the Russians . Would they get into trouble for taking a European into the border area ? No . Why should they ? This was one of several times we saw Mongolians acting contrary to communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gobi has not ended . It simply has taken the more polite form of charging each what the market will bear . An American youth who had purchased his ticket in Japan said he was charged $2.50 a night to sleep in a yurt . The European was paying $300 a day ? $3,000 for ten days of hunting in the Gurvansaikhan range of the Gobi . This included transportation within Mongolia but not the air fare from Europe . The trophy limit : one argal , two ibex . The price advertised in the United States for a ten-day safari in the North Altai region of Western Mongolia during 1972 was $6,700 . C.J. McElroy , president of the Safari Club of Los Angeles , reported that a ten-day safari he took in the North Altai , which included air fare and trophy-shipping charges , cost $14,000 . These near-prohibitive prices serve to keep all but a few from chasing the argali into sensitive border regions . McElroy 's safari had to he cleared with China and the Soviet Union as well as Mongolia because his route crisscrossed China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McElroy pursued one enormous argal for nine days back and forth across the China border . His reward , he broke the world 's record for an argal trophy . The largest sheep in both body and horn size ever reported taken by man , it weighed more than 425 pounds . The horns alone weighed sixty-two pounds and measured more than sixty-six inches in length . The Russians he met in this sensitive area were stationed some distance from the border at the new industrial center of Ulgii . This part of China has been closed to foreigners since the communists ousted the Nationalist Chinese in 1949 . Some of the Mongolians had never seen a white man . They would slip into McElroy 's tent , stare in awe for several minutes and depart without saying a word . In Mongolia , most of the nomads have been drawn into collectivesbreeding animals for export . Some have been settled on cooperative farms . Still , many roam with the seasons over vast areas in search of water for the herds . With the help of Hungarian technicians and equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Now there are twenty-three million head of livestock , more than have ever been counted before  --  twenty for every inhabitant . The Mongolians now are crossbreeding the yak with cows , to produce animals supplying the world 's richest milk and in quantities greater than either the yak or the cow produce . Daring Mongolian horsemen leave it to the cattle to do the fraternizing with the yak . They prefer to risk death lassoing wild horses with a rope on the end of a long pole . Household luxuries imported from both China and the Soviet Union are finding their way into the yurts of the herdsmen . Brass bedsteads , mirrors and transistor radios , conveniences not provided for tourists , decorate their movable homes . The challenge for the visitor is to find the herdsmen . From base camp I could see a nomad 's yurt . In the clear air beneath the blue sky , it seemed close enough to reach out and touch . After a mile 's walk in the direction of the neighboring yurt , ! found myself in a depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yurt behind , no animal in sight . Vast stretches of the Gobi appear to be perfectly flat . But like the waves of the mirage , the terrain undulates . The stranger can quickly lose his bearings , and unless he can retrace his steps , he is in trouble . I was , until a small boy chasing lizards caught up with me . The boy played two games , the brand-new game of running circles around me , pulling his Russian toy on a string , and the ancient game of pouncing on lizards with fantastic speed and precision . We reached the nomad 's yurt and found it as comfortably furnished as any we had seen . And , though the owners were absent , the boy knewwhere to find the kumiss  --  fermented mare 's milk . Marco Polo compared it to white wine . If Italian wine in the thirteenth century was what it is today , the first of the travel writers embellished the truth as much as the last . It tasted like sour milk fermenting . The intruder drank it because kumiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survives in the water . Surviving too is the tradition that a traveler is welcome to food and drink wherever he goes , whether or not his host is at home . The newest building constructed by the Russians is a glass enclosed circular stadium , real World 's Fair architecture . Among the modern touches are painted figures on the doors of the restrooms . But the pictures of man and woman in identical costumes confused everyone  --  I blundered through the wrong door . You could not tell them apart . Westerners see the best evidence of prosperity at Ulan Bator 's Sunday market . This market is sanctioned by the government . The newspaper U1aanbaataryn Medee recently car tied an article about plans to move it from the center of the city to larger quarters in the suburbs . It gets bigger and better every year . The visitor needs no directions to find the market . It is enough to follow the throngs creating a Sunday festival out of the event . A crowd of at least 10,000 had gathered by the time I slipped away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could at one time squeezed into a wooden enclosure the size of a playfield , pushing their way past displays of Chinese silk , dels , television sets , wools and hides and furs . The customers nibbled blueberries and currants as they bargained for everything from vegetables to costume jewelry and household furnishings . Individual merchants offered tempting souvenirs , a long-stemmed black opium pipe , a piece of pink coral , a marble snuff bottle . If anyone wonders what ever happened to the U.S. silver dollar , the answer has been found . Every second merchant had one for sale . The shoppers and merchants were using camels andhorse carts as well as automobiles to transport their wares . Whole families came on horseback , babies cuddled up to mother in the saddle . The gold and green roofs of G a n dan Tekchingling Monastery command the horizon in Ulan Bator . The faithful still prostrate themselves before the Buddha in a pigeon-filled courtyard , as orange-robed lamas pass to pray in pink temples . Pictures are allowed here , and visitors are entertained by the presiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gold . Most of the 125 lamas here are elderly ; but twenty-five students have been allowed to enter the monastery to keep it going . Since then the communists claim to have wiped out illiteracy . Nevertheless , their own census statistics reveal that 44 percent of the population above the age of twelve still has had no education . With Russian help though , the Mongolians have achieved their goal of seven years of compulsory education for all . The children of nomads go to boarding school . As late as 1941 , these people were 90 percent illiterate . By 1971 , they were 80 percent literate , according to an estimate published by American University in Washington . Starting virtually from scratch , the Mongolians have had no trouble showing enormous increases in industrial production . Completed projects include an oil refinery at Dzun Bayan in the Gobi region . At Ulan Bator , East Germans and Hungarians are building the world 's largest slaughter house . In the north , an international industrial collective  --  Mongolian , Russian , Polish and Czechoslovakian  --  has built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world copes with the population explosion , Mongolians view baby production as their most important industry . They know they will not be safe until they have inhabitants enough to defend themselves . Mongolian babies are precious and prized . Having escaped the guide on Sunday , I managed it again on Monday when all Ulan Bator was in a festive mood . Every second Mongolian approaching me on the street was carrying a great big yellow plastic duck tucked under his arm and wearing a look of immense self-satisfaction . The ducks had just been placed on sale at the department store , and had created a sensation . The Mongolians had never seen anything like them , and proud parents mobbed the toy counter . Away in a corner , a three-year-old , as plump as a butterball , walked in a small circle pulling her duck behind her and looking back in astonished concentration to see its head turn . Of course , the more children they have , the more Mongolians can afford playthings . The government subsidizes the fourth child in a family with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is more to come for each additional child . Women also play an important part in the economy , and their status is rising steadily . Without status , women nevertheless achieved considerable independence through their capacity to ride horses and to fend for themselves when the warriors the United Nations in 1961 . The Mongolians , with no way to avoid getting caught in the middle , wait and worry about the threat to their independence implicit in the continuing cold war between Moscow and Peking . A settlement of bor der disputes would relieve the immediate pressures on them . For the future , the Mongols ' hope is to build strength in numbers before the population explosion in China puts new pressure on the border . And any visitor who has seen the skill and daring of the Mongolian horseman as he dashes to lasso a wild horse will count on these people to multiply and prosper . The communist government is only pretending it has tamed them . rode off to battle . They never took their husbands ' names . Thus women were ripe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . The poker-faced woman customs agent at Ulan Bator showed no discrimination in handling departing plane passengers . First she confiscated ten rolls of motion picture film and an antique marble snuff bottle from a Polish technician . Next she took eighteen rolls of color film from a Swiss woman journalist and her husband . Then the inspector grabbed all the film she could find in my luggage , some of it not even exposed . Whatever the others had done , 1 had broken the rules by going alone to the market . " But I did not take a camera , " I protested . When Mr. Stan , the guide , declined to translate this , I called for the Russian-born A merican tour director who had accompanied us as far as Ulan Bator . " But they have a Secret Service . They saw you , " he shouted . They never saw me take a picture without permission . The trouble was , they did not know what pictures I had taken . The customs agent had found only two more rolls of film to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . Mounds of luggage rolled with no examination at all . During the rush to depart , Mr. Stan made amends by slipping most of my film into my flight bag . Border disputes never were allowed to interfere with the operation of the railroad built in the fifties to link Mongolia with both Moscow and Peking . Two trains each week , one Chinese and one Russian , cover the 4,890 miles between Moscow and Peking via Ulan Bator . So long as it can link rather than divide the great powers , Mongolia can retain its status . What the Mongolians want next is diplomatic recognition by the United States . After years of trying , they won admission to
