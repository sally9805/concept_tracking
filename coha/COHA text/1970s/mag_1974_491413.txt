IIKE0 .11MTWOM ONMO li LCOVE YHA ' mom ' MAMIIIE EMENHOWER The beginning of Ike 's painting as a hobby is really quite a story . It was in 1947 and I had one of my streptococcus infections . Tom Stevens , the artist , was doing portraits of Ike and me . He called to arrange another sitting . I said , " Well , after all , Tommy , I 'm sick in bed . " But Tom said , " I do n't want anything but your hands . " So he came up to my bedroom to do my hands . He sat there and painted , working from a paper palette . When he finished , he tore off the sheet with the paints on it . Ike saw all those beautiful colors on the palette and asked Toni what he was going to do with it . Tom answered , " I intend to throw it away . " Ike said , " Do n't do that . Leave it here for me , and I 'll fool around with the paints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houseman , Sergeant Moaney : " Moaney , bring me up a piece of board , some thumb tacks and an old dust cloth . " He put the dust cloth on a piece of board and started to paint . I was his first subject . His effort was the most awful look-ing thing you 've ever seen . I always wear a pink ribbon in my hair when I 'm in bed , so of course here I was in my pink bed and my pink hair ribbon . But the hair ribbon by the time Ike finished with it was three times the size it was in my hair ! But anyway , that was the beginning . On Valentine 's Day , the thirty-second anniversary of our engagement , I gave Ike a set of paint equipment . He painted everything  --  landscapes , portraits . He 'd make up things , anything . It did n't make any difference to him at all . He loved to mix colors . I think you can tell a lot about the kind of man Ike was from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abilene . So many of his paintings are familiar scenes from his past  --  the little boy with the fishing pole going down the country lane , the old red barn , and all the other pictures that were dear to his heart . But the painting that tells the most about Ike as a person  --  that tells about his stubbornness and his courage  --  is " St. Louis Creek . " He started the painting the day he had his first heart attack . He had just returned from a fishing trip in the Colorado mountains and had played a round of golf in the afternoon as well . That evening he was rushed to Fitzsimmons Army Hospital with a heart attack . Ike did n't complete the painting until the last weeks of his recuperation in the hospital . As soon as he was strong enough , the nurses put up a screen around the corner of the hallway outside his bedroom and he painted in his wheelchair by the light of the hall window . We came home from the hospital on November I I , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this painting says a lot about Ike . In over thirty years of marriage , I never dreamed that he would start painting as a hobby . The knuckles of both Ike 's hands had been broken because of football and baseball playing when he was young . All the experts did n't think he could pick up a paintbrush . But he did ; it was a gift and a joy to him . EDITOR 'S NOTE : Dwight D. Eisenhower used to joke that the nearest he ever came to an art course was mechanical drawing at West Point . He always referred to his paintings as " daubs  --  nothing else , " and he readily admitted that he was indeed a rainy day painter . If it was sunny outside , he was on the golf course ! In his paintings , one sees a deep love of color , beauty , and most of all , of life itself He painted for pure enjoyment . The Post asked Mamie Eisenhower for her personal remembrances of some of Ike 's paintings . In a rare and candid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduced by gracious permission of Eisenhower college in Seneca Falls , New York . This four year liberal arts institution , a living memorial to Dwight D. Eisenhower , was given sole rights to all of the former President 's painting in 1967 , with the hope that proceeds from the reproductions would be an aid in fund-raising for the college . Nothing was dearer to Dwight Eisenhower 's heart than the education of young people . It meant a great deal to him to think of the tremendous opportunities which would he offered to countless students in the years to come . YHE MEXffCAN HAT My favorite painting is The Mexican Hat . I do n't know why it has always appealed to me , but I think it is because it has such a roguish look about it . Years and years ago , Ike painted it from a Knox hat advertisement . Ike would copy anything . Because he gave paintings away right and left , every now and then I 'd tell him , " You 're not going to give that one away , are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging in the hall outside my bedroom at the farm . A FRENCH GA DEN Ike painted The French Garden for our second granddaughter Susie the day after she was born ( December 31 , 1951 ) . We were at NATO and our son Johnny called us long distance from Fort Knox , Kentucky , to tell us that the baby had arrived . Ike was so thrilled that he picked up a postcard that had a red rosebud on it , made the background by covering up everything that was on the address side , and painted his picture . Then he had the postcard framed and mailed to Susie . Shortly afterwards , Ike painted The French Garden for me . It hangs over my bed now at the farm and it 's been there for years . It has hung over my bed many , many years in all the places that we 've lived  --  at NATO , Columbia University , the White House . It is one of my most treasured and prized possessions . CAMP DAVff13 We loved Camp David , and we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is far away from all the hubbub and executive life . Ike used it for fun . He would have his own groups of friends come up and play bridge and golf  --  driving from the back of the yard in the bushes up to a putting green near the main cabin . They 'd have uproarious times  --  you never heard such laughing and carrying on . In the evenings Ike would go out in the backyard and cook all the steaks . It was always a good-time place for us . When Ike left office after eight years as president , the only thing I missed about those years was Camp David . ffTTSENY FliSHEIRMAN We loved our stay in France when Ike was at NATO Headquarters . It was our last quiet home life before the presidential years . He painted the fisherman in 1952 , and gave it to his military aide who had admired it . I think it is one of Ike 's very best portraits . There 's a serene look about it that I love .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
