For a year , Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski 's staff has investigated whether ITT Corp . ' s pledge of financial sup port for the 1972 Republican National Convention influenced a controversial antitrust settlement in the company 's favor . Last week , in a letter to a Congressman who had complained that the ITT probe appeared dormant , Jaworski disclosed that his staff had uncovered no evidence of any criminal conduct by ITT executives in the case . <P> But Jaworski said that his staff is still investigating whether ITT improperly influenced the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission . His office is also continuing its inquiry of possible perjury by ITT executives and former federal officials in the case . Last month former Attorney General Richard Kleindienst pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of failing to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee that President Nixon ordered him not to appeal an antitrust court decision favoring ITT . He asks only that he have two olives in his martinis at the end of his 16-hour days and that when he arrives at an event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more pompous ceremonial fanfare . He travels light . His airborne office is bare except for a Bible , a Congressional Directory and the World Almanac . <P> Soft Touch . Ford likes to call his perpetual motion " missionary work " for the G.O.P. Aides say also that Ford stays on the move because it gives him a chance to accumulate national exposure , it allows him to keep his distance from the embattled White House , and because he can not say no to a speaking engagement , especially when the invitation comes from a political crony . Admits Ford : " I 'm a soft touch . " <P> His critics and some of his friends worry that this gregarious , obliging , uncomplicated man who likes to call himself the first " instant Vice President " might be too soft for the presidency . Ford of course disagrees . After reiterating his by now ritual disclaimers ( " I do n't want the job ; I do n't plan on it " ) , he told Angelo : " I see no reason why I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself in that job some day , I feel prepared . I 've worked at it . I 've got friends , Republicans and Democrats , who would be helpful . I know the policies I believe in would be sound . "
