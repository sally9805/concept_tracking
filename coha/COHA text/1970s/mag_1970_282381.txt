THE British astronomer Sir William Herschel performed a curious little experiment some 170 years ago . After bending a beam of sunlight through a prism , he found that a thermometer heated up most if it was placed just beyond the red end of the spectrum . Herschel concluded that the mysterious heat source was invisible rays from the sun , but he could hardly have known that infra-red radiation-as it was called - would eventually let man see the world in an entirely new light . <P> Today , infra-red detectors are providing stunning images that were once totally invisible to the naked eye ( see color pages ) . The new medium is called color thermography-the technique of translating heat rays into color . Unlike ordinary color photographs , which depend on reflected visible light , thermograms , or heat pictures , respond only to the temperature of the subject . Thus the thermographic camera can work with equal facility in the dark or light . <P> The camera 's extraordinary capability is built around a characteristic of all objects , living or inanimate . Because their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of heat , or infra-red radiation . If the temperature rises high enough , the radiation may become visible to the human eye , as in the red glow of a blast furnace . Ordinarily , the heat emissions remain locked in the invisible range of infra-red light . <P> Since World War II , there has been an intensive effort to produce better infra-red detectors for the military . In Viet Nam , for instance , such devices have often been used to detect Communist troops in even the most densely foliated jungle . Other applications include heat-seeking missiles and spy-in-the-sky satellites . One of the leaders in the field , the Barnes Engineering Co. of Stamford , Conn. , has developed detectors that can " see " the dark part of a crescent moon from a quarter-million miles away . <P> Though their composition may vary , all these devices are based on the same technology : they are capable of transforming tiny amounts of heat into electrical currents . Once amplified , those currents are fed into a display unit that shows the rise and fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as uncomplicated as an ordinary light bulb whose fluctuations are recorded on photographic film . In some cases it is a more sophisticated cathode-ray tube system that produces a TV-type image .
