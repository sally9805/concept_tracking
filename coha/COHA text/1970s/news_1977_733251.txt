txt WASHINGTON  --  Several former American prisoners of war in Viet Nam say they were tortured by a team of Cubans while in a North Vietnamese prison camp known as " The Zoo , " just outside Hanoi . Leo K. Thorsness , a retired Air Force colonel and Congressional Medal of Honor winner , was one of the POWs at the Zoo . He said Friday that three Cubans beat another prisoner , identified as Air Force Col. Earl Cobiel , into what he described as a catatonic state . He said Cobiel died after refusing to eat and apparently losing all interest in life . The story of the Cubans came to light when Thorsness , who made an unsuccessful bid to unseat Sen. George S. D. , S.D. in 1974 , contacted Rep. Bruce Caputo IR. , N.Y. ) about it . Caputo has asked Defense Secretary Harold Brown and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance for a full report on the allegations . THORSNESS SAID that when he was freed from prison in 1973 , Defense Department officials told him not to discuss any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid endangering any Americans still in Viet Nam . But the Pentagon announced Tuesday that it will begin a final review of the status of the 631 United States servicemen still listed as missing in action and the 31 thought to be prisoners of war because " there is no credible evidence " that any of them are still alive . Thorsness said he is breaking his silence about the Cubans because lie believes the American people should know about Cuban atrocities at a time when the U.S. is moving to resume diplomatic relation 's with the Fidel Castro regime .

IIOMAR SAID he believes " Fidel , " who received VIP treatment from the North Vietnamese , was brought to The Zoo in 1966 to demonstrate how to " break " the American POWs and get them to " confess " publicly to being war criminals . Ten men , including Bomar , were chosen for a " complete submission " program of beatings run by " Fidel , " Bomar said . But the prisoners resisted the program at every turn , he said .
