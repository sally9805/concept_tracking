As an Icelandic Airlines plane revved up for a flight to the U.S. last week at the Luxembourg international airport , the scene near the boarding area was typical of the line 's departures . Most of the passengers-a few families with children , many students with rucksacks and a large contingent of disheveled hippies - had been waiting for six hours or more . The young people passed the time dozing on the grass , discussing astrological signs or swapping stories in the harshly lit shed that serves as a waiting room . Quite a few passengers were smoking-but not necessarily tobacco . A Luxembourg policeman moved among the more exuberant youngsters , sniffing for the telltale scent of marijuana , which is something like burning autumn leaves . " Pigs are pigs any place in the world , " muttered one youth . <P> In some ways Icelandic , which youthful fans called the Hippie Airline , is a jet-age Toonerville Trolley . Much of its fleet , three leased DC-8 jets and four turboprop CL-44s , is on the wrong side of the aircraft generation gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve hours while a windshield wiper was flown from Iceland . But to its great credit , the line has not had a fatal crash in 18 years of flying the Atlantic . <P> Passengers who fail to reconfirm reservations 72 hours in advance lose their space and often have to stand by for two days or more to get another seat . <P> <P> Some flights between New York and Europe take 14 bumpy hours , and all stop at Reykjavik , nobody 's Acapulco . Aloft , a party air pervades the aircraft as young people wander the aisle in search of companionship or add to the graffiti on the backs of seats . Lunch and dinner consist of simple food like chicken and peas . <P> Shunning the Cartel . Icelandic is faring much better than competitors on the lucrative North Atlantic run . In the first five months of 1970 , the little line 's passenger volume increased 41% , to a record 71,500 passengers . Its average load factor is an enviable 69% . Last year it earned $1,095,000 on revenues of $23.5 million . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excursion ticket between New York and Luxembourg costs $259 in the peak season and requires no minimum stay . For turboprops the fare is $239 . The cheapest equivalent flight on any other scheduled line is $320 New York-to-Brussels , with a minimum stay of 29 days . <P> The bargains exist because Icelandic refuses to join the International Air Transport Association , the rate-making cartel . As a result , only New York 's John F. Kennedy Airport and Luxembourg international officially allow Icelandic to use their facilities for transatlantic jet flights . ( The U.S. makes this concession because NATO has American-manned military bases in Iceland ; Luxembourg 's airline does not belong to I.A.T.A. ) Icelandic manages to fly CL-44s out of five other European cities , but does so through a clever device . It charges I.A.T.A. rates on regular flights from , say , London or Oslo to Iceland ; then it steeply reduces the fare for the rest of the journey from Iceland to New York .                   @ @
