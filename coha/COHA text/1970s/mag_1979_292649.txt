And Iran acts like a country without a king <P> His face looked tense , his eyes were tired , his smile strained . Posing for TV cameramen and photographers at Niavaran Palace overlooking Tehran last week , Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi showed the physical exhaustion of many weeks of crisis . When asked if he planned to take a vacation , the Shah replied quietly , " I would love it , if the situation permits . " A few days later , however , after issuing a royal decree naming Shahpour Bakhtiar , 62 , as Premier-designate with power to form a civilian government , the Shah merely left Tehran with his family for a couple of days of rest at Jajrood , a ski resort 50 miles northeast of the capital . <P> It was hardly the " vacation " that Bakhtiar had in mind when he asked the Shah to leave the country for a year or two as the price for putting together a new government .

Even those in the middle classes who still backed him , partly out of fear of what might follow , knew his cause was lost . His chief support remained high-ranking officers in the military . Several hard-lining generals urged the Shah to stay and pleaded with him for permission to launch an all-out military crackdown on dissent that probably would mean enormous bloodshed . To his credit , the Shah refused . But there was still a real fear that military officers concerned about the danger to the Shah 's survival might yet attempt to shore up his power by staging a coup . In hopes of placating both the military and the opposition , Bakhtiar named General Feridun Jam , a popular officer who has had differences with the Shah , as Minister of Defense .
