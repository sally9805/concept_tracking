The most valuable and least imitated magnate in major-league baseball is a dour , puffy-eyed individual who : ? Makes $10,000 a day . ?

Wrigley is one of the most impressive , implausible , even incredible figures in American life . And one of the least understood . For he has spent a lifetime pursuing something which wealth ca n't give him : to be inconspicuous ? to be Mr. Nobody . It is difficult when your name is the same as a famous building , a busy ball park , and a vast business empire that turns out thirty billion pieces of your product every year , each with your name on it : ( " He hates to be called " Bill Veeck once said . " It makes people think of him as a gum , not a person . " ) It is more difficult when one has the temperament of an individualist . Phil Wrigley has done everything from winning a steer-roping contest , riding to and from work on a motorcycle , flying gliders towed by a speedboat across Lake Geneva in Wisconsin , to resolutely ignoring the pleas of all other moguls that he install lights in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fans ; it was put in by owners who wanted to boost the gate " ) . It is most difficult when all of one 's habits seem a defiance of the place of privilege in life : Phil Wrigley has won a certain celebrity for his non-U habits ( answers his own office telephone , acts as his own receptionist ) , his sense of taste ( for years his favorite TV program was Robin Hood ) , and his conspicuous indifference to whether he ever got out to the ballpark to see the Cubs play . Because of all this  --  because he is genuinely an unpretentious man , lacking in any sense of self-importance  --  he is today the #1 Number Two choice in baseball : most fans would just as soon see Phil Wrigley 's team win if their own ca n't do it . One reason is that he has spent so much time  --  and money  --  waiting for so little success . There was a twenty-five- or thirty-year period , from the forties to the late sixties , when his Chicago Cubs lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all existing records for con // secutive finishes in the second division . Those were the years when the Cubs kept coming up with players who could n't do anything in the infield but rake it and outfielders who regarded every fly ball as an adventure . Phil Wrigley tried everything from hiring an athletic director right out of college to installing a rotating-coach system  --  eight to thirteen coaches who were supposed to swap the head-coaching job every few months  --  to hiring one field director whose greatest gift was as a ventriloquist : " I got eet , " he 'd say , throwing his voice into the throat of enemy first-baseman Orlando Cepeda , as opposing infielders circled under a " Cub homer " ? a pop fly to the mound . " They play like they 're looking for a place in history , " wrote one critic of the Cubs , " and when they find it , they wo n't like it . " Then Phil Wrigley hired the one man he 'd singled out as a nonmanager , Leo Durocher ( " would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as saying in the pre-Durocher years ) . Leo quickly turned everything around . The Cubs changed from drab failures to spectacular failures . In 1969 , they turned in the most dramatic collapse in baseball history ; after leading the eastern division of the National League from Opening Day to Labor Day , they went from 91/2 games in front of the New York Mets to 81/2 games behind them in the last few weeks of the season . By last year their reputation as a fighting ball club had spread to the farthest reaches of the Cub clubhouse ; in one team meeting late in the season , one Cub star  --  third-baseman Ron Santo-reportedly had to be physically restrained to prevent him from attacking Durocher , And many of the other players took the opportunity to tell Leo what they thought of him : " the worst manager I 've ever seen , " said Joe Pepitone . While outside the organist in Cub Park resolutely played the theme from Love Story . In the next few days , owner Wrigley weighed the old baseball adage that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new team and rejected it . His ad in the Chicago newspapers warned the warring players that " Leo is the team manager and the ' Dump Durocher ' clique might as well give up . He is running the team and if some of the players do not like it and lie down on the job , during the off season we will see what we can do to find them happier homes . " Then in the off season he did n't unload the players so much as give support to a quiet reshuffling of the front office that brought into a key position the man many thought might one day replace Leo : Whitey Lockman . That the Cubs opened this season with a chance to make a reality out of the old dream is due less to what they unloaded than what they acquired . They got Rick Monday and Jose Cardenal to play the outfield beside veteran Billy Williams . That gave them an outfield with speed and savvy to go with one of the best infields in the National League . They also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenkins and he 's already won at least twenty games a year for each of the last five years and , in Billy Williams , one of the most consistent and successful hitters in baseball . They have an improved coaching staff . The Cubs went out and got coaching help for Leo in every department from running the pitching , at which he 's not strong , to running public relations : the Cubs hired a coach to do nothing but shield Durocher from the press . . . and sometimes from the players . If all this works , the Cubs may achieve a success that would , for Wrigley , be a vast irony : it would destroy the thing he seeks most  --  being a nobody . For he is completely unlike almost any other owner in baseball ; he loves being out of the limelight . He 's never appeared on radio or TV and he 's made only two public speeches in his life  --  both of which he considered torment . On the rare occasions when he does go to a ball game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of in his own box seat " Have n't sat there since they put in an outlet for an electric blanket , " he snorts . Though he 's president of the ball club and owns 8015 of its 10,000 shares , he doesn'tpreside over the annual meeting -- or even attend it for that matter . He got it shifted to Delaware , far from Chicago , a few years ago , so that it could he held as far away as possible . He 'd head for the West Coast while the annual meeting was held on the East Coast . It is one of his few conceits that he is the only owner of a pennant-winning ball club who was never photographed in the pregame ceremonies of the World Series . To be sure , the occasion has not often arisen  --  the last time was in 1945 ? but when it did , he spent the three days while the World Series was in Chicago sitting at his desk , writing letters to fans to explain why they did n't get tickets . " My ambition , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cave somewhere with no telephones and a big rock over the door . " It is not that he hates baseball that leads him to avoid going to games ; it 's that he hates big-manning it around baseball . On a private level , he gets deeply involved with the fans . A year or two ago , he put out $10,000 so that the Bleacher Bums  --  the ardent vocalists in the left-field bleachers in Cubs Park  --  could take a road trip with the ball club . When he 's in the office , he sometimes winds up talking baseball for hours with fans on the phone , if only because he answers his own phone . He does n't have a secretary screen his calls . " Generally they start out a little belligerent , " he said . " ' I want to talk to Mr. Wrigley , ' they say . ' Okay , you 're talking to him , ' I say . They always seem a little surprised . " The only thing that bothers him is the suggestions they have for improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas , " he said . " If you only come up with three twenty-game winners , you 'll be all right . ' Well , who the hell would n't ! " As a very private man , Wrigley observes some very private rites . He prefers to watch the ball games on TV or listen on radio instead of spending the afternoon at the ball park . But wherever he is when he 's watching them  --  in his office in the Wrigley building , in his apartment overlooking Lake Shore Drive , in his workshop on his Lake Geneva estate  --  he solemnly rises and observes the seventh-inning stretch . That he stays away from the games has , he feels , its practical side . " I ca n't hit or field or pitch . All 1 can do is help out on the business side , " he explains . " If I go out there , the best time is in the morning . In the afternoon , you ca n't find anybody to do business with  --  they 're all out watching the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still chairman of the William Wrigley , Jr . Co. , which makes Wrigley 's Spearmint and Wrigley 's Doublemint , and Wrigley 's Juicy Fruit  --  and P.K.'sand which had a value , at late-winter market prices , of something in excess of $275 million . The assets of the ball club , according to its last annual report , were $5.4 million . That difference is a significant one : the Wrigley gum company is not only fifty or sixty times larger than the baseball club , but considerably larger than all of big-league put together . So it is not strange that Phil Wrigley feels less compelled to sit around in the afternoon in the ball park , watching a ball game in person , than to sit around his gum-company office , tending to its business and half-watching the ball game on TV . There is yet another reason , a most subtle but inescapable one : Wrigley would rather work than sit around and watch others work . His way of relaxing is by working with his hands . He is definitely not of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more exercise in running a chain saw over some logs than there is in a round of golf , " he told me . So when he has some free time , he likes to climb into his coverall and go out and work in the garage or workshop or around the grounds . When the Cubs were making their grand sweep towards history a few years ago , up to the heights and crashingly down again , he was n't anguishing at the ball park . He was digging postholes on his land . " For two miles of fencing , " he said . " A hole everyten feet . A thousand holes  --  and every hole we dug , we hit a rock or a root . " The work had a special kind of satisfaction : every time the Cubs would blow a game " I 'd take it out on the roots and the rocks . " As it happens , he is more than casually skilled in working with his hands . He might be more successful as a mechanic than as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a spring training game and hand it back all fixed up in twenty minutes or a half-hour , " says John Holland , a vice-president of the Cubs . He 's invented a number of tools , including a nonslippable screwdriver that can be inserted into a very small slot and then locked into place with the flick of a lever so that no matter how hard it 's twisted , it won'tslip out of the slot . ( He assigns the patents and royalties on these devices to some of the cronies  --  grease monkeys , not millionaires -- -who 've worked with him in garages and workshops over the years . ) He 's loved working over cars and improving on them . As a mechanic , he installed many devices on his own cars long before they were ever adopted in Detroit  --  automatic chokes , four-barreled carburetors , ring horns , automatic turn indicators , double-and-running tail lights , overhead cam shafts . Every once in a while , Detroit works hard to catch up : once he redesigned the electrical system on his Cadillac and GM adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest thing I know to creation , " he said of working with his Continued on page 110 hands . This may be an echo , as reflexive as blinking , of the conviction uttered by longshoreman/author/ philosopher Eric Hoffer , among others , that the common man needs such work to prove to himself his own individual value . In any case , it 's a sensation that Wrigley has over the years been careful to preserve . " I can remember when he had ten to twelve old cars  --  a Stutz Bearcat , a Scarab , a Cord , a Locomobile  --  stored away in machine shops and garages in his homes all over the country , " says one long-time Wrigley chauffeur and fellow tinkerer . " So he could work on them whenever he pleased . " In fact , there 's a garage and workshop behind the old Chicago mansion he moved out of forty years ago that has a gleaming 1957 Cadillac , with 1972 license plates , in it . For years , Wrigley went back to the old address , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boyhood years  --  but to visit his cars and to work over them . " You ca n't park your car in an apartment , " he explains , " and you ca n't take it apart on the living room rug . " There 's only one thing he does n't do well with his hands : dial a telephone . " He hates to return telephone calls , " says Helen , his wife of almost fifty-five years , " because he does n't like to dial . " It may be because he never learned to read swifly , and he never learned to spell well ( it 's part of the Wrigley legend that he sometimes misspells his own name ) . So he never became comfortable with the letter-and-number system on telephones . " When he really has to make a call , " says his wife , " I 'll do the dialing for him . " But as a man who 's learned the earthy reality of working with grease and loam , Phil Wrigley has developed a direct , if somewhat informal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gum company could n't come up with a gum that would n't stick to false teeth , he urged them to try to come up with false teeth that would n't stick to his gum . When his marketing and advertising people warned him that the name Wrigley was virtually unpronounceable in  --  and untranslatable into  --  certain foreign languages , he suggested that they put out the gum with the Spearmint or Doublemint Arrow on it , but without the name Wrigley , and " then sit back and see what the people call it . " In Hong Kong , it became " Rider of the Arrow " gum , and in certain Middle Eastern countries it became " White Arrow " gum . Similarly in mainland China before the Communists took over : there are literally hundreds of dialects in China and no easy way to explain about Wrigley 's gum and that it came in sticks or in packages with five sticks to a pack and that the cost depended on how many sticks you bought . So Wrigley , who 'd spent some years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in long unwrapped ribbons that could he hung up in a store , with a scissors or knife nearby , so that customers could cut off as much as they wanted to buy , much as an old-time dry-goods clerk in the United States cut bolts of cloth . In all of this , the most difficult thing is to spend tens of millions of dollars to promote a gum named Wrigley , while seeking to elude the limelight . His tactics are typical . The gum company spends more than $20 million a year to advertise gum , but very , very little of it is spent on the sugar-coated , tablet-sized " P.K. 's . " ( His father , in launching P.K. 's back in the 1920s , took pains to recognize his son 's nature : he emphasized that  --  as we have seen ? " Wrigley " is most difficult to translate but that " P " and " K " appear in almost every language . ) P.K. himself is very scrupulous not to have the family name attached casually to everything he 's involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cubs ' Park , " not " Wrigley Field , " and some years ago he had the steamship line he owns  --  the Wilmington Transportation Co. , which plows the watery channel between the California coast and Catalina Island ( which he also owns ) ? changed to Catalina Steamship Company . The reason : he feared that people who saw the " W " on the ship 's smokestacks would think the initial meant " Wrigley . " At the same time , he is terribly scrupulous that everything connected with the Wrigley name deliver the best possible quality . In the 1940s , he resigned as president of the gum company when the company 's directors urged , in response to wartime shortages , that the quality of the gum be reduced even in the postwar years . It was quite a while before he agreed to resume the direction of his own company , at $ I a year . ( The gum formula was not changed , but the membership of the board of directors was . ) He is just as scrupulous about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bazaar every summer . He spends day after day in an air-conditioned trailer on his estate , brewing thirty pounds of fudge , bit by bit by bit . ( " It 's the chunky kind , not the creamy kind , " he explains , and he thinks it 's just a little grainy . But he wo n't condescend to make it by the batch or the vat , just to make up time . " You can double the recipe , if you want , but any more than one pound and it ceases to be homemade fudge . " Perhaps his most dramatic economic edict , though hardly his most significant one , involved the bar in the Wrigley Building restaurant . He was at lunch one day in the restaurant  --  one of the finest in America , // which Wrigley customarily operates at a loss  --  when a companion commented that the double-martini glasses did not offer double the pleasure for double the money . Wrigley was alternately incredulous and outraged . He called for the suitable glasses and ran an experiment at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result was indisputable : a " double " was less than twice a " single . " This is a deceit indulged in by many a famous restaurant-and-bar , but Wrigley would not have it in his restaurant-and-bar , He ordered all the " doubles " glasses destroyed on the spot and replaced  --  by the cocktail hour  --  with full " doubles . " ( The restaurant has since discontinued its doubles glasses ; but it delivers three to three and a half ounces of the basic liquor in its " single " Martinis and Manhattans , giving them more potency than doubles served at many other bars . ) The thing that has made him the most distinguished magnate in baseball is that he treats customers of the Cubs the same way . Some years ago , he came to the conclusion that the chairs in the box seats of Cubs ' Park were too small . There were ten to a box at the time ; he ordered new chairs that reduced the capacity to eight to a box , thus cutting the revenue by 20 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folding type  --  removed and replaced by curved formed-plastic chairs that are permanent . ) Then he decided that the fans who sat in the far reaches of the box seats ( deep along the first-and third-base lines , near the left- and right-field corners ) had a great view of grass growing in the outfield but not of the batter or the infield action . The reason , of course , is that the seats were all built row-on-row  --  as they are in most parks  --  and those that flank the outfield look at the outfield . Wrigley promptly began a multimillion-dollar program to have the concrete foundations for those box seats ripped out and new ones built on an angle so that occupants of the box seats faced home plate and the most constant action of the game . ( " A man who pays for a box seat has a right to see the game without getting a pain in the neck . " ) In the mid-1960s , to cite another case , it dawned on him that baseball fans in the local bars knew more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the fans who 'd paid their way to get into the ball park . - " Because they heard the announcer on television explaining what was happening in the game , " he says . He promptly ordered loudspeakers mounted in certain sections of the ball park so that fans could go there and , while watching the game in living color , hear the same TV patter they 'd hear if they were watching the ball game in a bar . There was no extra charge for this : Wrigley was just trying to provide an extra service for the fan . The intriguing thing is that fans did not flock to those sections of the grandstands . It may have been that they were bringing transistor radios to the ball parks and did n't need , with the radio broadcast of the game , the TV commentary piped in over it . Or it may have been as Wrigley himself diagnosed it : " The real dyed-in-the-wool fan is insulted if you try to tell him too much about the game . He does n't need the TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the first  --  and sometimes the only ? major-league owner to : ? Bar all advertising from the walls and scoreboards of the ball park , and cover the walls with vines instead  --  a beautifying effort that deprived the ball club of millions of dollars of income over the years ; ? Close off and cover over ( in green ) a section of the center-field bleachers so that the batters would n't be blinded by the glare of white shirts in the sunshine as the ball came at them out of that back-ground ; ? Have the scoreboard flash the ball-and-strike count , flash " hit " or " error " on a doubtful play , use yellow numerals to indicate runs-scored in an inning-still-in-progress ; ? Experiment with moving ramps on the inclines to the upper deck ( that did n't work ) ; ? Try wiring the pitchers ' jackets for heat so that they would n't cool off on chilly spring days ( that did n't work either ) . He is almost spectacularly free of the more money-grabbing qualities of baseball 's other owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hard to find , " says Bill Veeck , who 's worked for , and had his differences with , Wrigley over the years . " He 's one owner who would n't hesitate to vote against his own best interests if he felt it was in the interest of the game . " ) He has , in fact , sacrificed his own best interests on a number of occasions . He did not , for example , object when another owner , Lou Perini of the Boston Braves , decided to move into " Cub territory " ? the baseball hotbed of southern Wisconsin  --  in order to correct his own club 's near-bankrupt condition by siphoning off Wrigley 's customers . Wrigley 's position was that baseball needed to avoid another bankruptcy more than he needed the customers . Nor did he object when Walter O'Malley decided to move his Brooklyn Dodgers into " Wrigley territory " in Los Angeles , where the Cubs had a top minor-league team . He felt that major-league baseball had to expand to the West Coast  --  indeed , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he made it easy , and virtually costless , for another owner to take his territory . But he did object ( albeit privately ) when the Milwaukee Braves franchise was uprooted and moved to Atlanta , even though the move was executed by Bill Bartholomay , the son of an old family friend and neighbor . He felt that baseball 's integrity would be damaged by the cynical shifting of franchises around from one city to another as the money-vine withered in place after place . His most celebrated stand has been against allowing night baseball into Wrigley field . He says it 's because he has a responsibility to the people who live in the Cubs neighborhood : " You would n't like to live where you have 20,000 or 30,000 people yelling and hollering up to midnight every night , " he says . There were seasons , particularly in the early 1960s , when the Cubs sometimes lost more than $900,000 in a year  --  when night baseball , as a local novelty , might have reduced the rush of red ink . Yet Wrigley refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in novelties like night baseball but in performance . His claims seem to have been sustained in the last few years . The Cubs ' attendance record stood for forty years  --  they were the only major-league team which failed to set a new attendance record since the end of World War II  --  but in the last three years , with the Cubs in continual competition for the title , the record has been broken or approached all three times . " What we needed was good baseball , " says Wrigley , " not night baseball . " Actually , Wrigley has hinted in the last few years that he might one day have lights built around Wrigley field " so that we can finish games that run late into the afternoon , so that we can turn on lights , instead of calling off the games , when the umpires tell us to . " ( The Cubs now start some doubleheaders as early as 12:15 p.m. in order to get the games completed , particularly in late season , before darkness falls . ) Bill Veeck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an $18-a-week helper on up to the executive echelon , insists that in the 1930s the Cubs explored putting in light standards  --  disappearing light systems that could be raised or lowered electrically so the natural look of the ball park would n't be destroyed . But Veeck says that he could never get a go-ahead from P.K. " We tried to sell him twenty times on lights , " says Veeck . The clincher against lights came when Cincinnati became the first to introduce night baseball back in 1934 . " Having blown the chance to be first with lights , " Veeck has recalled , " Mr. Wrigley just was n't going to do it at all . " Wrigley has a reputation for the bizarre as well as the visionary . Back in the 1930s , he quietly hired an Evil Eye to put a " whammy " on opposing teams during the height of a pennant race . According to Veeck , he paid the Evil Eye some $5000 down and guaranteed him as much as $25,000 if the Cubs won the pennant . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for publicity . In fact , he specifically ordered Veeck to keep it secret from the newspapers . The Evil Eye was supposed to stand behind home plate and cast his whammy by Western Union . The opposing teams never got the messages , of course , so the Cubs did n't win the pennant . And the Evil Eye was finally released outright to whoever would have him . " I really do n't see why people think acted strangely , " Wrigley said some years later . " If the orthodox does n't work , why should n't we try the unorthodox ? " The difficulty is that not even baseball will accept some of his more perceptive and visionary ventures . In the 1930s and 1940s , for example , he perceived that the reserve clause would one day come under blistering fire . ( That 's the contractual form which binds a player to one ball club , and only one , until the ball club wants to get rid of him  --  by trading him , firing him , or retiring him . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't play at all . ) To some , the present reserve clause seems to violate the nation 's antitrust laws . They feel it represents a conspiracy by the owners to prevent men from working freely in their chosen profession . Though at the time there was no clamor against the reserve clause , Wrigley had his staff work out three other ways the same goal might be achieved , legally and constitutionally . But he had no place to test them out , major-league baseball was n't about to explore an alternative to the reserve clause  --  it still is n't  --  and neither was any other pro sports organization in existence . So Wrigley started his own pro sports organization . It was called the All-American Girls Baseball League and he thought it might enjoy a certain popularity as a replacement for small-town baseball during the war , when many male players were in the service . He had the girls ' uniforms ( swirling miniskirts of an earlier era ) highly stylized , and he emphasized the femininity of the players , not the pseudo-masculinity  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The league survived until only a few years after World War II , but it did demonstrate that an alternative to the reserve clause could be made legally viable . Baseball 's owners triumphantly ignored all these efforts ; they still react to discussion of the reserve clause like quail to the sound of gunshot . But though baseball could ignore the solution , it could not forever ignore the problem : the present unrest within the game may lead to court decisions or player strikes that could dramatically revamp  --  or end  --  the reserve clause , and bring Wrigley 's old ideas to the fore . In the search for high-quality players , Wrigley reasoned back in the 1930s that it might be well worthwhile studying a championship team to determine what qualities made it a champion . So he hired a psychologist from the University of Illinois to identify , the mental , physical , and emotional characteristics of his Cubs , who were then winning pennants in three-year cycles-1929 , 1932 , 1935 , 1938 . He felt that up-an d -c oming prospects might be measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping the Cubs pursue future championships . " If you want to make the best knives in the world , you buy the finest steel , " Wrigley was later to explain . But it is easier to identify enduring quality in steel than in baseball players . " You can go out and spend $250,000 for a ballplayer and he may not be able to cut the butter . But if you know what makes a player who does come through in the majors , you have something . It 's surprising how many players can play triple-A ball but still not make the majors . " However , baseball was not ready for such advanced thinking . The players , and some of the sportswriters , heaped scorn on the idea and on the psychologist . They did everything possible to frustrate the research ; for all the psychologist could find out , baseball players are the stuff that telephone poles are made of . " We were too far ahead of our times , " says Wrigley . And he 's right . This system of analysis has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams endeavoring to sift through the college crop ; indeed , the Dallas Cowboys . who have the most thoroughly computerized scouting operation in football , used it to move from the absolute depths of the National Football League to become Superbowl champions . But baseball has yet to follow pro football , and accept the foresight of one of its own owners , in measuring new talent . As one who spotted the value and opportunities of automation and computerization in business long ago , Wrigley has long tried to get computers introduced into baseball analysis . For a long time , he had statistics run through computers at the Wrigley gum company so the ball club could provide the " head coach " with a set of computer-produced punch cards that would tell him who performed best in any given situation during a game . This had a flaw : no baseball man anywhere , coach or manager , is going to rely on a computer instead of his own sense of " feel . " If the computer tells him that  --  in the last half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and the Cubs losing by a run  --  a third-string catcher does best in a particular situation against a particular pitcher , no manager is going to yank a Ron Santo or a Billy Williams to use the third-string catcher as a pinch hitter . With a Leo Durocher , who prides himself on being a " hunch " manager ( i.e. , he does things even his players do n't understand , or appreciate ) , the logic of a computer is an absurdity . But Wrigley managed to get Durocher at least to look at the product of the computers , which offered a different angle of vision on the players ' performances , with a vaster detail than Durocher 's own memory could provide , Early in the 1970 season , Durocher discovered , for example , that when the Cubs had used a certain batting order the previous season , they 'd won 70 percent of the games they played . ( " I sat up until three o'clock in the morning , going over those statistics , " said Leo . ) He promptly switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cubs won seventeen out of the next twenty-one games they played . The trials and triumphs of Wrigley with the Cubs go back some forty-six years . He bought his first share of Cub stock in 1926 . But his family 's involvement preceded that . His father began buying into the ball club before World War I. His father was perhaps more emotionally involved with the Cubs : he bought control of them when they were in last place and within four years saw them win the National League pennant and go into the World Series . But his father was by nature more emotionally involved with everything in life . He was a hearty , backslapping , publicity-courting extrovert who was given to slogans ( " Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm " ) and who , in building a good idea into a vast fortune , came to symbolize an era  --  he was the subject of a cover story in Time magazine a week before the stock-market crash in 1929 . Indeed , it is illuminating to see how two generations of one family can give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men running the fortune are immensely different in personality .

He started in his father 's plant as a soap-crutcher , mixing and laboring the bubbling soap mix with a paddle for $1.50 a week . After a little of this he persuaded his father to send him out on the road as a salesman . " 1 was a full-fledged long-pants traveling salesman before I was thirteen , " he was to say in later years . He traveled the high-grass routes of Pennsylvania , New York , and New England , selling scouring soap from a four-horse team with bells on the harness . He was a remorseless and daring salesman . When other manufacturers cut their prices below his father 's , he promptly raised Wrigley scouring soap to sell at ten cents instead of a nickel  --  but he gave his dealers a premium ( sometimes baking soda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people wanted the baking soda so much that he began selling it and using chewing gum ( at that time called chicle ) as a premium . Then he found out that the chewing gum was more popular than the baking soda , and this time he decided not only to sell it but to manufacture it . So in 1891 , when he was thirty years old , he settled in Chicago and , with a " fortune " of $32 , started what became the world 's largest gum company , and made a personal fortune of more than $30 million . His secret was in using advertising to sell his product . It was not easy . He was among the first American businessmen to see advertising as a vehicle that , however costly , paid incredibly rich dividends . At first his faith exceeded his returns . He invested $100,000 in an ad campaign ... that produced nothing . He invested an additional $100,000 in an ad campaign ... that produced nothing . Then he invested another $250,000 in an ad campaign ( this was all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things began to pay off . By the 1920s he was enterprisingly spending $4 million a year on advertising . The result was that his business  --  by then a big one  --  tripled in ten years . Later , P.K. Wrigley was to say , " Years ago we used to take double-page ads in The Saturday Evening Post . " They were among the earliest color ads in all of American publishing ; the Wrigleys did n't like to take a back seat for anything . " You could always tell when the Post was running a Wrigley ad : the cover was in red and green , the colors we used in the ad . " Young P.K. was born and raised in the years of the company 's infancy . He grew up in a mansion on Lakeview Avenue , in Chicago , opposite Lincoln Park . As a boy he used to go horseback riding with hisfather in the park , usually at 6:30 in the morning , discussing such weighty matters as finance and personnel problems . His father was among the first industrialists to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as life-insurance policies as a fringe benefit , and a chance to buy shares of the company 's stock . All this , taking place before 1920 , established the elder Wrigley not only as a success but as a character . Almost everything he did embellished the idea . Around the time of World War I , he bought a mansion in Pasadena , California , in order to have a place to spend the winter . He spent one night in it  --  so goes the legend  --  before he got intrigued with a goat haven called Catalina Island and decided to buy it . In 1919 he spent $3 million to buy the Santa Catalina Island Co. , which owned all but about one acre in the middle of the island . The Wrigleys kept the old home in Pasadena ; Phil 's mother lived there , in a coma or near-coma , for years before she died in the 1960s . Phil Wrigley then turned the house over to the Tournament of Roses Committee . By then he had his own vacant ancestral house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln Park ) from his father and started to raise his own children there . But there was a kidnapping scare in the 1930s and Phil Wrigley  --  ever a man who wanted to sink gratefully into some anonymous background  --  abandoned the house and moved into an apartment building on Lake Shore Drive , where , presumably , kidnappers or anybody else would have trouble identifying the Wrigleys . He 's never returned to the house on Lakeview , though he keeps it up  --  a new heating system was installed a few years ago  --  and he has some of the old family retainers living there . Today the house is surrounded by high-rises ; and Wrigley carefully bought lots on both sides of the old home so that nobody could put up a high-rise beside it . As a boy , young Phil went to all the right schools  --  Chicago Latin , Phillips Academy in Andover , Massachusetts  --  but he never learned all the right things , like reading and spelling . The reason , he says , is because the family read to him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd settle down in the garage as he was working over somebody 's engine and read the newspaper or current books to him . In any case , Wrigley decided to spend his post-high-school years outside of college ; he traveled around the world and then went to work in the Wrigley Plant in Australia . When he came home , he decided he wanted to study chemistry at the University of Chicago  --  one course in chemistry . But the university insisted that any person in any class would have to sign up as a four-year student , not a one-subject scholar . Wrigley obediently signed up for a full year 's curriculum , paid the tuition , and then cut every class every day , except for the one class in chemistry that he wanted to attend . He quickly flunked out , but not before learning what he wanted to learn  --  about chemistry . Phil went into the service in World War I working with his hands ; he wound up running an aviation-mechanics school at the Great Lakes Naval Air Station . He spent a strenuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he won a reputation for his skill at motorcycling , at dice , at gliding , even at cooking ( he worked hard on his own and various other yachts and finally won a card in the Cook and Waiter 's Union ) . But he had a bright and farseeing eye out for investments . There were no airlines in America then , but he was convinced that aviation would become an important means of transportation . So he invested in a seedling airline company ... that became United Air Lines  --  and he joined with Edsel Ford and Marshall Field III and several other businessmen to finance the construction of the first all-metal airplane to fly on that airline ( it became renowned as the Ford Trimotor ) . Meanwhile , his father continued cutting his own swath through the times . He was asked to run for mayor of Chicago and he refused . He promoted his Catalina Island holdings by offering $25,000 to the winner of a race across the channel from Catalina to the California mainland . ( " World 's Greatest Sporting Contest for One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrigley 's modest acclamation . ) It attracted reams of publicity , as well as 103 entries , and a great deal of speculation over whether anybody could survive in the 52 ? waters  --  colder than the English Channel  --  long enough to swim it . ( An Eskimo entrant , who claimed to have swum the Bering Strait , enraged the other entrants by muttering ostentatiously about the disgustingly " high temperature " of the swimming site , as well as its deplorable lack of ice floes . ) When bear grease became the rage for guarding the swimmer 's skin against cold , Wrigley resourcefully ordered 200 pounds of the best available axle grease and 100 pounds of prime hog lard made available on the beach so that no one contestant would have an advantage over another . He had the steamer , 4 valon rigged out as a hospital ship and floating grandstand and had some 300 boats made available to convoy the swimmers  --  and President Coolidge personally ordered the Coast Guard to stand by . The general effect was of the greatest armada afloat this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the irrepressible joy of the older Wrigley , it was covered even more thoroughly . The race was won by a seventeen-year-old boy from Canada who , it was trumpeted , used the last savings of his widowed mother to get to the swim site so that he could win enough to buy her a home in sunny California . At least he upset some of the most famous long-distance swimmers in the world : " Channel Conqueror Holds Spotlight of Entire World " read one headline . " Lad Receives Fortune from Chicle Monarch , " read another . Wrigley was delighted . But by then he 'd already determined to build the most famous office building in the world , and he 'd proved that he knew how to do it . He chose a location on Michigan Avenue , just on the north edge of the Chicago River . It was then a " throw-away " part of Chicago , a grubby little street of storefronts and occasional residences that had never been conceived of as part of downtown Chicago . " People thought he 'd gone too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , " says Phil Wrigley . But the elder Wrigley had a few notions on how to make the new building more-than-somewhat noticed . For one thing , he ordered huge clocks to be built into each of the four sides of the 400-foot tower of the Wrigley Building ..... so everybody within seeing distance in the Loop " ? including those in the older office buildings ? " would turn to look to the Wrigley building to find out what time it was . " He had the building set back so that a plaza for walking and sunning could be developed around it ( at the time , it was considered an outrageous use of good space ) and he ordered the side of the building to be covered in a white terra-cotta , an enamel that was extremely expensive to process and mount . Then he ordered huge banks of floodlights mounted , discreetly but pointedly , at various distances from the building  --  some of them on an isolated bank across the river , some in parking lots behind it . At night , those floodlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine like a beacon in the night . The building did become one of the most famous in the world , a landmark that not only became famous , and filled , in itself but which touched off a building boom on Michigan Avenue . Today Michigan Avenue is renowned as the Miracle Mile and it glows with heightened , and lighted , prosperity from the Wrigley Building to the John Hancock Building . When young P.K. was thirty-one years old , he was named president of the gum company . " I 'm not sure I 'm succeeding solely on my own merits , " he said at the time . " I have a feeling that ' pull ' and the fact that I 'm my father 's son had something to do with my election . " He was right . And when his own son was twenty-eight years old , Phil Wrigley made sure he became president of the gum company ( though Phil remains as its chairman and , in the view of many , its guiding genius  --  despite his claim that he 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a businessman , he was more than slightly foresighted in his operations . In the depth of the Great Depression , he arbitrarily decided to give everybody in the gum company a raise of 10 percent , instead of laying them off . " It was an act that made headlines around the world , " said Arthur Meyerhoff , who handled Wrigley 's advertising for more than a quarter-century . " He thought it would be contagious , that it would get the American economy going again . " The idea was right , but the timing was , as ever , wrong . It took a good many years of pump-priming by government , not private enterprise , before the economy began to do anything but slump further . But Wrigley was already going beyond pump-priming . In a time of torturously high unemployment , he guaranteed his employees a job . And ? twenty years before America 's labor unions first landed a " guaranteed annual wage " in a major industry  --  Wrigley offered his employees " income assurance . " His method was simple . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of surplus for these projects . Then he signed all his employees , even the blue-collar group , to contracts , guaranteeing them a certain income during the contract period . Even if the employee had to be laid off because of a lack of business , Wrigley guaranteed them that they 'd be paid for up to thirty weeks a year , whether or not they worked thirty weeks a year . ( The plan was not for executives ; it was for employees making less than $120 a week  --  a rich reward for factory workers in the Depression years and , for that matter , for many years afterward . Wrigley 's explanation : " This assures an employee a definite income for a definite period , regardless of conditions beyond his control . It is a backlog for him , just as the surplus of the company is a backlog for the stockholders . Since the surplus of the company is the backlog for the stockholder , it seemed right that he share some of this assurance with the employee . " There was only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual income refrain from going on welfare rolls if they were unemployed . He felt it was an exchange of responsibility between employee and employer ; both would agree that the employee remain a private responsibility , not a public liability . " It is our idea that any company in a position to do so should assume full responsibility of taking care of the people within its own organization in slack as well as boom times , " he said . Later he tackled another problem of industry : the forced retirement at an arbitrary age , say sixty-five . He concluded that many people who are sixty-five do n't want to stop working full time and shift immediately to full-time loafing . So he arranged that his employees continue working past their sixty-fifth birthdays , if they wished . But he insisted also that they begin taking on-the-job training towards retirement . In their first non-retirement year , they had to take one full month off from work , in the second year they had to take two full months off , in the third year they had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were ready to take all their time off . Thus his retirement-and-pension program came to be recognized as one of the most foresighted in all of American industry . But by that time he was deep in another project ; he was one of the first manufacturers anywhere to invest heavily in automation on the production line and to use computers for staff and accounting work , and also to develop a program to make sure that his employees would not arbitrarily be thrown out of work by introduction of these new devices . Indeed , his determination to meet the needs and aspirations of his workers  --  as well as the imperatives of profits  --  became an example of how business and free enterprise can contribute to " the orderly revolution " of the working classes . " I do n't know  --  maybe I 'm a socialist or something , " he said a few years ago . " But I think the more people we have who own homes and cars and have a chance to go to college , the better off we 'll all be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company in a most conservative manner . He did not let it fall into debt of any kind ; he paid even for capital costs out of operating income . He did not let it become a conglomerate , pushing aggressively into different fields . He expanded it , but always within the realm of gum ( and certain kinds of mints and candy ) . The expansion , he thought , had to be in the gum-chewing habit and in the population group  --  teen-agers up to the mid-thirties  --  most likely to develop the habit . It was also in overseas areas . Wrigley not only has plants in the United States but also in England , France , Germany , Austria , Canada , Mexico , the Phillipines , Australia , and New Zealand . These conservative policies did not hurt the company 's profits ; it has paid a dividend every year since 1913 . The absorbing thing is that it pays dividends every month , so that the dividends become a continuing income for its stockholders . Wrigley , for example , draws a relatively modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $50,000 a year bracket . But he owns or controls 24.2 percent of the gum company stock , approximately 476,000 shares . Last year , he earned $5 in dividends on those holdings or roughly $2,380,000 , very nearly $200,000 a month . ( He does not pocket every penny of it ; some 111,000 shares of his holdings are in family trusts that he controls , so certain dividends are delivered to those trusts . ) As the dividend is raised in 1972 to coincide with increased profits , the fortune Wrigley controls yields $10,000 a day , particularly when income from his other holdings is included . ( Though only , one must emphasize , when calculated for a five-day work week . ) Through most of these years , Wrigley and the gum company fought determinedly to keep the price of gum at a penny a stick ( or a nickel a package ) . The gum company got slightly more than 2.9 cents for every pack sold to a gum-chewer at a nickel . But finally the cost of raw material caught up with it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-stick packs of gum to be retailed at a dime a pack . ( It would then get a nickel out of each ten-cent pack , or precisely $0.00714 per stick . ) There would be expenses in all this . Wrigley would have to spend up to $30 million for new machinery , principally to wrap the new and larger packs of gum . This would prompt the company to borrow money for the first time in many , many years , but the moneywould  --  if Wrigley had his way ? be short-term borrowings from banks . Thus it would be at a very low cost , by comparison with long-term borrowings . This one move  --  increasing the price of gum  --  more than doubled the value of Wrigley 's company . For years considered an " old maid 's company , " the William Wrigley , Jr. , company suddenly became one of the " glamour " stocks on Wall Street . In 1970 it sold , at its low , for $88 a share . In 1971 it sold , at its high , for $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped again ( to the 140s early in 1972 ) because earnings fell below the level the research analysts of certain securities houses expected . But there was a strong suggestion that earnings would catch up with expectations , and that the " glamour " would be sustained . Given the parade of profits of the gum company , the performance of the baseball club seems more spotty , The elder Wrigley began investing in the Cubs in 1915 when he bought a minority interest . He bought controlling shares of the ball club in 1925 , when the Cubs were in last place . In 1929 they won the pennant and set a Cub attendance record and old William Wrigley told them to go out for a night on the town on him . But he would n't , he warned , pick up a bill for anything less than $50 . The Cubs did n't win the World Series that year , or in any of the following pennant-winning seasons in the three-year cycle . The elder Wrigley died in 1932 ; young Phil Wrigley began increasing his investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1934 . The Cubs had five good years . After that they went into a steep and enduring decline . The 1945 pennant was less a trend than a wartime freak ( even the St. Louis Browns , with a one-armed outfielder , won a pennant during World War 11 ) . The long-term trend is reflected in a more remorseless statistic : the Cubs finished in the second division twenty-four times in twenty-seven years . The Cubs fans were spectacularly tolerant . The Cubs were one of the first teams in major-league history to attract a million fans by finishing last . But their finances were not always healthy ; they lost as much as $902,000 a year , have not paid a dividend since 1948 . " I once suggested a $3 dividend , " says Wrigley , " but one of the other stockholders said we needed a shortstop instead . " A shortstop could n't help . Wrigley brought up Ernie Banks as a shortstop : he set an all-time record for fielding at the position and hit more home runs in a five-year period ( 1955 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mantle , more than Mays , more than Maris . But the Cubs continued their generation-long slump . Even in the two years that Banks won the Most Valuable Player award , his ball club finished in the second division . One year the Cubs had a team made up of Banks and assorted other rookies-of-theyear and sophomores-of-the-year , as well as other players who were to become top stars with the other clubs ( such as Lou Brock ) and still they finished next to last , behind the completely new franchise in Houston . " And , without Ernie Banks , " growled Old Pro Jimmie Dykes , " they would of finished in Albuquerque . " Phil Wrigley sought desperately to find the formula for cracking through defeat . He built a vast farm system ; he reversed himself and demanded a small farm system , He sought big-name managers  --  Frankie Frisch  --  and no-name managers-Jimmie Wilson . And finally he set up the rotating-coach system so he could search for the right personality to run the Cubs without making headlines every time he wanted to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves . One evening about dinner time in the spring of 1960 , I phoned him to ask if he was thinking of changing managers , since the Cubs were performing more miserably than usual . " No  --  have n't given a thought to it ! " he told me . The next morning before nine o'clock , he 'd traded off his manager ( Charlie Grimm ) to a radio station in return for an announcer ( Lou Boudreau ) who also brought the Cubs in next to last . He was just as restless in seeking a man to run the front office . " Myfather always told me , ' If you ca n't build an organization that can get along without you , then you have n't done your job , ' " he says . The men he sought , at least for a long time , seemed to make up in bombast what he lacked . Once he put out a feeler to Frank Lane , an irresistible and dynamic man who 'd resurrected his cross-town rivals , the White Sox . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyed him . Another time he offered a longterm contract to the late Larry MacPhail , who made it a solo run in taking the Brooklyn Dodgers and later the New York Yankees to the baseball heights . Then he abandoned the idea when MacPhail let it be known that he  --  not Wrigley or any of his flunkies  --  would make all the decisions . The way it was reported by insiders is that Wrigley asked MacPhail : " You want to fire me as president of the club ? " MacPhail : " I agreed that was the idea . " MacPhail was n't hired . The man who was hired was retiring , pallid , careful , conservative  --  a reflection of Phil Wrigley himself . His name was John Holland , and the first nine or ten years of his administration were , as the preceding years , total failures . Then the Cubs , and Wrigley  --  and Holland hired Leo Durocher , who 'd not managed for twelve years . Leo asserted himself : " This is not an eight h-place ball club , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his first year he managed them into tenth place . But after that , the Cubs picked up ; by last season they 'd been up in the pennant race far enough long enough to make $473,934 , instead of losing $902,000 as in the pre-Durocher years . That may explain why Wrigley was n't going to fire the manager to accommodate the players . In 1972 , both reach for affirmation . Leo Durocher , for all of his enormous publicity , has a most modest record : he began managing in 1939 and since then he 's guided one team , but only one , to a World Championship . ( Walter Alston , so different from Leo in demeanor and manners , took over the Dodgers and equaled Leo 's record in his first year of managing ; he 's since won a total of four world championships . ) Phil Wrigley , for all of his contributions to baseball , has never had a world-championship team . Nor did his father ; the Cubs have n't won a world championship since 1908 and the " **25;3266;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just in Wrigley 's view but in the views of millions of fans who wish on him the " best of second-luck . " For the candor of the man has come through , as well as his lack of self-importance . There is a sense that " Phil Wrigley deserves it  --  if our team ca n't win , let his team take it . " It is the ultimate and humbling irony for a man who has spent his life seeking to be inconspicuous  --  and turned out to be accepted warmly as the most exceptional man in baseball . n
