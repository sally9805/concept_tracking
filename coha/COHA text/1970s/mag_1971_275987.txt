Who Killed the Bluebird ? If a marriage can die a hundred deaths , it can seemingly survive a thousand coroner 's inquests . Who killed the bluebird of happiness , and when ? <P> Robert Anderson puts the questions anew in the second , longer , and stronger of his duo of playlets , Solitaire/Double Solitaire . ( The first is an Orwellian fantasy penned in plastic . ) In Double Solitaire , Charley ( Richard Venture ) and Barbara ( Joyce Ebert ) have allowed 23 years of marriage to carry them from bliss to boredom . Charley is also caught in the middle of the contemporary value crisis . On the one side are his parents , people of stamina and principle , who have weathered 50 years of marriage . On the other side is Charley 's son , who flaunts his liberated liaison with a girl he does n't intend to wed , and who upbraids his father for choosing durability at the cost of joy . <P> Behind the talk of loss and emptiness , there is a voice that speaks more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , best known for Tea and Sympathy . It is literate . It is-horrors ! - the voice of a gentleman , someone who has been taught from childhood to uphold certain standards of decency . <P> The failure of his marriage perplexes Charley , but the assault on his codes brings intolerable pain . He is incapable of philandering-one antidote for marriage-poisoning urged on him . He is equally incapable of ricocheting from marriage to divorce to marriage to divorce . This is what makes the play , and its dilemma , undeviatingly honest . Anderson offers a final comfort that is small , but not cold : the heart is the only broken instrument that works .
