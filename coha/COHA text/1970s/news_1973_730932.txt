txt Tropical storm Delia struck the Texas coast today with 70-mile-an-hour winds , blinding rain , and high tides but caused virtually no physical damage . Scattered flooding produced isolated human hardship along 300 miles of Louisiana and Texas coastline . The only extensive damage was at Cameron , La. , more than 100 miles from the center of Delia 's impact with land , where six-foot tides forced about 8,000 residents inland . Along the Texas coast , particularly in the Galveston-High Island areas where the indistinct eye of the storm hit , beaches were evacuated briefly , but reoccupied within two hours of the passage of the-storm.
