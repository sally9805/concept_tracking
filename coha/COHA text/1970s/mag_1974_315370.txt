Of the four painters who created the language of cubism in the early teens of this century-Pablo Picasso , Georges Braque , Juan Gris and Fernand Lger-the first to die was also the youngest : Gris . His real name was Jos Gonzlz , and he was the 13th child of a polyphiloprogenitive Madrid businessman . After a brief apprenticeship as a comic illustrator in Spain , Gris got to Paris in 1906 and installed himself as Picasso 's neighbor in the now legendary Bteau-Lavoir , a ramshackle cluster of studios in Montmartre . He painted nothing of importance until 1910 , and uremia killed him in 1927 just after his 40th birthday . <P> His output small , his conduct resolutely inconspicuous , Gris has long been the least-known major French artist of the 20th century , and the claws of myth have never got a hold on the cool , highly wrought , intellectually guarded surface of his art . Nor , until now , has his adopted country honored his mem ory with an official show . The gap has at last been filled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( through July 1 ) , organized by France 's Chief Curator of Museums Jean Leymarie . <P> Still-Life Sea . The first thing to note about Gris is the acuteness of his limitations . There are some artists who can do virtually anything , Picasso being their modern archetype . There are others who seem able to master only one thing ; and of these petits-matres , Gris is the exemplar . <P> There was one motif-and , as this show inexorably suggests , only one-with which he was fully at home : the still life . Still life was the test bed of cubism-the static arrangement of homely objects , a glass , a bottle , a bowl , a newspaper , some cards or grapes , which could bear all the twisting and rotation and chopping that the cubist eye demanded . With a few rare exceptions , like Picasso 's famous portrait of Kahnweiler or Gris 's 1912 portrait of Picasso , the human figure , mutable and livery and emotionally expressive as it is , was not the ideal cubist subject . Distortion of the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest of form , but one can not violate an egg or a tabletop . They are dead form , nature morte , already . <P> Gris seems to have felt a certain helplessness in the presence of outdoor nature . Compared with his still lifes , for instance , a set of landscapes that he painted at Cret near the Spanish border of France in 1913 are almost embarrassing : he could not reduce the intractable organic shapes of hill , tree and terrace to anything much better than a set of decorous formal clichs whose color verges on the garish . Indeed , the only part of the great outdoors he could handle with ease and pleasure was the sea itself flat , rotating upward to face the viewer like a blue polygonal tablecloth - framed in the shuttered terrace door of a villa on the Cte d'Azur and bearing a yacht 's triangular sails the way a folded napkin might sit on a table . It is this still-life sea , a geometrical image of repose and wellbeing , that suffuses some of Gris 's finest still lifes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , with its firmly composed foreground of earth-colored guitar suavely undulating below the combed sky and receding gray headlands .
