CHILE <P> " We are on the verge of a civil war and we must prevent ... " Salvador Allende Gossens managed to warn his audience on nationwide television last week before the lights flickered twice and the screen went dead . Saboteurs had blown up the tower supporting a main electric circuit in Santiago , leaving the Chilean President without a live camera and 60% of the population in the dark . An hour later , thanks to some fast splicing , Allende was back on the air , his voice strained , blaming right-wing elements for this latest terrorist act . <P> Allende 's problems are considerably more serious than a blackout . For the past three weeks 40,000 truck owner-drivers across the country have been on strike , ostensibly in protest against the Marxist government 's inability to provide them with spare parts . The revolt has paralyzed the nation 's transportation system , causing severe shortages of fuel , food and other essential goods . Movement in three southern provinces has all but ceased , public transportation in the capital has been cut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the truckers . <P> Last week TIME Correspondent Rudolph Rauch visited one group of truckers near Santiago . His report : <P> The men clustered around the transistor radio are almost all outsize and beefy , wearing pea jackets and hard hats . One of them sports a silk foulard tucked into the front of his V-necked cardigan . A white Mercedes is parked near by , surrounded by less regal vehicles-Peugeots , Fiats , a few pickups . <P> All around are rows of trucks : huge trailers , big vans and ancient wooden five-tons and , most important , about 60 big tankers used for taking fuel to the capital . All have been disabled by their owners , who have removed the wheels and hidden the carburetors or the distributors . The men are listening to a news report describing how their wives are being tear-gassed and hosed down by water cannons in front of the presidential palace , where they had gone to demonstrate for their husbands ' cause . <P> The truckers could be Chile 's Archie Bunkers , characterized by having a low level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with their money . Some of them , however , are civil engineers forced into trucking because of the lack of jobs . Others , like Manuel Alvarez , have been journalists abroad who returned because they were homesick . " This is a battle for the future , " says Alvarez , the owner of an old truck so lacking in engine parts that it had to be towed onto the field . " I am fighting so my children wo n't have to be Marxist . Marxism annuls personality and takes away initiative . " <P> Military Puzzle . Officially the truckers have been on strike to protest the lack of spare parts ; in reality , they hope to bring down the government , which , they claim , wants to put them out of business . When the military joined the government to back Allende , the truckers admit they were baffled . " The generals were bought by the government , " one complained .                    @
