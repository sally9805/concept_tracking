txt WASHINGTON  --  When President Carter was returning from the Tokyo economic summit last July , one of his closest aides remarked that anti-inflation chief Alfred E. Kahn was " a little bit flaky . " This was at the height of the long gasoline lines and the deep public con/ cern caused by the massive price Increase by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . Instead of being i calm , the administration aide said , Kahn went to Congress and screamed " catastrophe , catastrophe , catastrophe . " Now , a few months later , Fred Kahn , once the administration 's king of quips and candor , is no longer Mr. Irrepressible . For weeks , he virtually dropped from sight , so much so that reporters were surprised to see him recently sporting a new mustache . " I hear the same rumors you do , that Fred has been muzzled , " said one Carter aide . " BM I have no way of knowing . I could not confirm or deny them . " KAHN , WHO seemingly specialized In angering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post a year ago , denies that he has been muzzled . Instead , he said he was busy negotiating the second year of the wageprice guidelines with labor and business . In addition , he said , " 1 guess people got tired of me . " But Kahn has not lest an of his former touch . In an interview in his old ? Executive Office Building suite , he appears from behind his desk without his shoes on . " You do n't mind , do you ? " he asks . A few minutes later , he plops in his rocking chair and munches away at a pot pie and salad on his desk as he answers questions . A year ago , Fred Kahn was delighting the media with a stream of quips and somewhat bizarre behavior that brought some life to an otherwise dull team of economic advisers . His piece de resistance : Told by the White House not to use the world recession in his speeches , he said the nation was on the verge of another " banana . " IN THOSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was heading would , over a few months , help bring down the rate of inflation . He once said he would resign if no progress were made . He also said the program could be considered a failure if the rate of Inflation had not subsided  --  by this past summer . Inflation is worse , but Kahn has neither resigned nor admitted that the program is a failure . The former Cornell University professor , however , has become more restrained . His former idealism is tempered with comments about being effective in the political realm . As for making optimistic remarks , he says , " After a year of being bitten , I do n't want to be a Pollyanna . " Kahn 's style irked White House officiate more than anything else . They have never questioned his ability as an economist . He is now being given some credit for helping persuade top labor // Top inflation fighter Kahn goes low-key // leaders to participate in the newly ere sled Pay Committee , which will develop wage standards for the second year of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been criticized for poor administration of the guidelines during the first year of the program and for devising a price guideline that had so many loopholes it did little to halt the tide of price increases in the early months of the program . Rahn never had much interest in the day-to-day- administration of the guidelines . He worked instead at his favorite topic : regulatory reform . This is a slowmoving , dull area of inflation-fighting , but to Kahn it is more important than guidelines . But here , too , he has become a realist . With food prices going up sharply , he is not rushing into meetings urging , as idealists might do , that the government do away with all price supports and farm controls , which have a way of keeping prices up . Instead , Kahn said , he is working to try to make small changes . " It 's foolish to be a total titter at windmills , " he said . " Rather than fight in this way , I try to operate at the margin . " HE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setasides ( taking acreage out of production next year because of his urging , he said . In addition , he is working to restrain milk and tomato prices . For Americans who have seen inflation increase by 13 per cent since Carter 's wage-price guidelines have been in effect , it might seem that Fred Kahn is attempting to sell refrigerators to.Eskimos . Kahn realizes that his program has a terrible image now , but he says the people have a wrong impression . The program can not control food and energy prices , he said . If these " uncontrollables " are taken out of the program , he said , prices would have gone up only 7.5 per cent in the last year . If the program is to succeed , he said , the economy must slow down . Not only would that cause a slackening of mond for goods , he said , but it also would reduce the nation 's oil imports . KAHN 'S NEW IMAGE is a little unsettling to some . One former Treasury official said it indicates that the inflation chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once trumpeted himself as the champion of " marginal cost pricing , " the economic theory that prices should go uo to reflect their true costs , so that you pay for what you get and so that prices are high enough to induce new supply . But the former Treasury official said Kahn abandoned his own theory when the issue of decontrolling the price of domestic crude oil came up . He argued for keeping price controls even longer than Carter ultimately decided , the official said . Yet , when Kahn was asked whether the price of another product  --  money itself  --  had been pushed up too high through interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve Board , he said no . Even at that , he left no doubt that he believed high interest rates were contributing to inflation . The Fed , he said , had no choice .
