txt Protests mounted yesterday against President Nixon 's new Vietnam actions , , with demonstrations in city streets and on campuses across the country . Among the larger demonstrations here was one that filled a Park Avenue block from curb to curb with perhaps 2,500 people in the afternoon and clogged traffic for about an hour . The demonstrators moved to Times Square , where they again blocked traffic before dispersing last night . Another 2,500 demonstrators , some of whom had marched down the West Side from 106th Street , filled Times Square later in the evening . In all , there was little violence here during the day . Ten persons were arrested , mostly for disorderly conduct . Meanwhile , nightfall brought with it intensive street fighting between students and police in several cities , from Berkeley , Calif. , to Gainesville , Fla . As had happened the night before , hundreds were arrested in the disorders , the most turbulent since May , 1970 , following the United States move into Cambodia . The second Times Square demonstration reached its peak at 10:55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and posIsession of dangerous drugs . At the head of the line of march clown the West Side was Representative Bella S. Abzug , who carried a " jahrzeit " candle . This , in Jewish ritual , is a candle lighted in commemoration of a dead person . The march was sponsored by the West Side Peace Committee . There were rew banners  --  one read , " Stop the Bombing , End War ar Now "  --  and the marchers were convoyed by policemen on foot , in cars and on scooters , By 79th Street , the crowd had swelled to 400 people , and grew in size rapidly as it moved downtown . Earlier , traffic in Times Square was snarled for more than an hour as demonstrators from the Park Avenue gathering sat and lay in the roadway . Shortly after 8 P.M. , the police began moving them back to sidewalks  --  which often meant dragging , as demonstrators went limp , and in at least four cases members of the Tactical Patrol Force used nightsticks . The official " target " , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic island in the center of Broadway , was barricaded with sawhorses . As the marchers moved into the area , there was singing , chanting and shouting , but little action . Many of the marchers were carrying lighted candles . Marching next to Mrs. Abzug was William F. Ryan Jr. , the son of the Democratic ' Congressman Mrs. Abzug is trying to unseat in a primary battle . Supporters of Mr. Ryan said he was in Washington working on antiwar legislation . The mass protest here took place on Park Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets , and started about 3:30 P.M. It had been called last week by a wide-ranging coalition of peace groups and given added im ? petus by the President 's an . nouncement Monday that North Vietnamese ports were being mined and railroad lines bombed . The block was chosen be . cause 20 stories of the building at 320 Park Avenue , on the west side of the avenue , house of . flees of International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation . The concern was chosen , along with the " massive escalation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tan ; get for the demonstration be . cause of its " role in the Viet , nam conflict , " presumably as a supplier , either directly or through its subsidiaries , of mill . tary equipment . Nonviolence Is Urged The protest , in which at least four persons were arrested but no major confrontation . be ? tween demonstrators and the police took place , was designed around a manber of theatrical 1 " simulations " ? such as the dropping of miniature parachutes from a window in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . This was followed , to the accompaniment of the recorded sounds of air raids ' and firing , by a " simulated saturation bombing , " ' after ' which ? more than 100 protesters stretched out , or at least . sat down , in the street , blocking traffic . In front of the I. T. &; T. building , pickets had been marching since about 3 P.M. with banners , placards and signs attacking the Administration ? or I. T. &; T. , or both . " Mined Harbors Mean Peace ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " another asserted . Across the avenue , where demonstrators had filled the steps of St. Bartholomew 's Episcopal Church , ' a young man who identified himself , only as " Philip A.D. " was exhorting the crowd through a bullhorn to make this a " nonviolent action " and to wear an " End the Air War Button " if they wished to be arrested for sitting-in on the sidewalk in front of the I. T. &'T.; building . The plan for mass , unopposed arrests was not , realized , however , partly as the result of what appeared to be a police strategy of avoiding confrontation so far as possible and of allowing the protester 's energies to . dissipate , This meant that the demonstaters , ' sitting : and standing , closed off the block at both ends ; forcing traffic to be diverted , from shortly after 5 P.M. until about 6i15 . Then , their , numbers dwindling , they moved off by a circuitous route toward Times Square , , which they reached at 7:15 . The plan was to rendezvous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was scheduled to start at 8 P.M. from Broadway and 106th Street . The police did make an ? effort on the west , or downtown , side of Park Avenue to keep one lane open for cars . There was some angry scuffling as they did this and Used four mounted policemen to clear the crowds . Throughout , the police seemed to be carefully avoiding even the appearance of unnecessary force , at times holding the nightsticks above their heads with both hands . At least one person was hit on the head with a nightstick , however , and at least one other yanked by the hair . Liberation Front Flags By far the majority of the Park Avenue demonstrators were students . ' A group from Sarah Lawrence , College staged one of several " guerrilla theater " performances , smearing bread and other food products of I.T . &T.; subsidiaries with theatrical make-up " blood " and chanting a rhymed " history " of United States involvement in Vietnam ? " 1972 . . what we gon na do .. . bomb the craters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty souls ... " When the sun came out , there was a chant from one group of " Here comes the sun , the people of the world are picking up the gun . " There were a number of red , yellow and blue flags of the National Liberation Front in the crowd , and shouts of " Ho ! Hol Ho Chi Minh " and " Highway 1 , Highway 1 ? take Saigon and Washington , " as well as Peace ? Now ! ' One of the older persons in the crowd was Beatrix Turner , 72 years old , who was wearing a veterans-for-peace overseas cap . She said she had been a sergeant in the Women 's Army Corps in World War II . " I feel our country has never been in greater peril , " she said . There were sit-ins  --  hew or continuing  --  on a number of campuses , including Rutgers University in New Brunswick , N. J. , the University of Rochester and Syracuse University . // only 25 remained , huddling around a small fire and vowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruiting booth on the traffic island in the center of Broadway . They said they would try to prevent anyone from entering the booth this morning . Although the demonstrations were mostly peaceful , two demonstrators were hospitalized after clashes with the police . Three police officers were treated for minor injuries and released . Among the 10 arrested was David Selvin , a 26-year-old reporter for radio station WBAI . The police said he had been wearing his working press card but was seized when he allegedly interfered with other arrests .
