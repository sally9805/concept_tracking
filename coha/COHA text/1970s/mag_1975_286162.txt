Whatever happens to prices in the rest of the economy , postal rates seem to do nothing but zoom . Last week the financially troubled U.S. Postal Service formally applied to the Postal Rate Commission for a 26% across-the-board boost in rates . Though the commission will spend a year considering the proposal , the service will be allowed to lift rates on a " temporary " basis shortly after Christmas . The Postal Service noted that it is currently losing $2.6 billion a year , and even after the next increase it will lose " hundreds of millions of dollars " this fiscal year , which began July 1 . Altogether , the new rate hikes will swell revenues by $2.4 billion a year . <P> Under the proposed increase , the cost of mailing a first-class letter weighing up to 1 oz. would , as expected , rise from 10 to 13 ; each additional ounce would cost 11 . The lowly post card would go up from 7 to 10 . Under the new schedule , the cost of second-class mail used to ship newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of other second-class rate rises totaling 127% since 1971-and poses an economic threat for many publications . Third-rate bulk mail , under the new rate schedule , will climb 23.9% , and parcel post , 10.1% . <P> Large Subsidy . According to many experts , the Postal Service 's chronic financial squeeze stems from a conflict of goals . Under the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 , the U.S.P.S. must operate as a public service , so postal authorities regard themselves as being obliged to continue performing many uneconomic operations , such as delivering mail door-to-door instead of at a central pickup point . Yet the law also insists that the Postal Service attempt to be selfsupporting . Postmaster General Benjamin F. Bailar is urging Congress to undertake a study to determine whether the U.S.P.S. needs an increase in the $920 million federal subsidy it now gets , the so-called public service payment . To hold down deficits and head off rate increases in the years ahead , Bailar also wants Congress to double the present subsidy during the two or three years that such a complicated study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union Threat . Meanwhile Bailar is working to cut the Postal Service 's costs and improve efficiency . In Portland , Ore. , a program to reduce wasted costs and effort by ensuring that all carriers handle an equal amount of mail has been tried . The powerful 245,000-member National Association of Letter Carriers is likely to fight Bailar 's proposal on the ground that it is an illicit speedup . Bailar also plans to hold down new hiring by exercising more vigorously the Postal Service 's right to move workers from one job to another . <P> Finally , postal authorities also will study ways to reduce the number of small post offices by combining districts where feasible . Only recently , the General Services Administration , Congress 's financial watchdog , reported that up to 12,000 of the nation 's 31,000 post offices could be eliminated at a saving of $100 million a year , with practically no loss in efficiency . Yet considering the demands made upon the nation 's Postal Service , it may well be unrealistic to expect that even with improved efficiency it can ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
