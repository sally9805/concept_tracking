txt " They started the war , and they must have thought about all the risks , " said Maj. Gen. Yeshayahu Gavish , commander of the southern Sinai Peninsula , whose troops provide the blocking force south of the trapped Egyptian III Corps . Here in Sinai , scene of the only major military action continuing despite the Middle East cease-fire , officers and men of the Israeli forces are agreed on at least one thing : The Egyptian troops , whose water supply is cut off , should be given water only if they hoist the white flag or should be allowed to withdraw to Israeli lines on the opposite bank , leaving their bridgehead and their equipment behind here on the east bank of the Suez Canal . The skyline of Suez can be seen from here , and no smoke or sign of battle rises from it . A huge oil fire burns a little farther north ; it is impossible to tell in whose territory the fuel dump lies . Israeli forces have occupied almost all of Suez , The Associated Press reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . The Egyptian force still controls about two and a half miles of the shoreline on the , ' Gulf of Suez around Port Taufig and could perhaps be evacuated from there , but Israeli guns are clearly within range . To illustrate further the topsy-turvy nature of the disposition of forces along the Suez Canal , some of the Egyptian guns emplaced on the east bank , which the Israelis held , have fired on Israeli troops in the city of Suez , across the Gulf of Suez . The front was quiet today , but the Israeli armor colonel explaining the situation said there was not an inch of the flat desert near the bank of the gulf where we stood that was not raked by Egyptian artillery fire yesterday , The colonel reported that since yesterday , by arrangement with the Red Cross , Israeli blood plasma was being delivered on Israeli jeeps to the Egyptian force of al // Many as 30,000 men to care for its wounded . The III Corps , consisting of one mechanized and two infantry divisions as well as considerable artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive across the canal both from Egypt and from the second Egyptian ' bridgehead to the east side of the canal , north of here . While the Israelis are crossing no man 's land to supply the Egyptians with blood plasma , - no one is supplying them with anything else . There are no sources of water on the Asian bank of the canal , and Israeli troops control the fresh-water conduit that runs from the Cairo region to the African bank . No political decisions about the application of the cease-fire have been made public ; perhaps they have not yet been needed . In any case . the Israeli commanders would not favor providing drinking water or food to the encircled force . General Gavim. and other commanders said there had been ' no sign of demoralization or loss of firepower among the encircled Egyptians . The estimate on this side is that they have water for four or five days . An armor commander said captured tanks were heavily stocked with food , drink and ammunition . The possibility was raised by General Gavish and other officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Israelis in this sector , which has not been open to the press , have fought a major battle from the beginning of the war on Oct. 6 , and the charred evidence is all around . In the first three days the Egyptian Army mounted a heavy southward drive out of its bridgehead , striking along the coastal highway . The tsraelis fell back about seven miles before stemming the advance . The way back to where they stand now was slow and presumably costly , although Israeli commanders do not discuss their losses . The Egyptian losses are still to be seen : quantities of overturned and burned out vehicles that , like the roadway , bear the marks of deadly air strikes . And not all the Egyptian dead have been removed . The road south of here , lined by spectacular dunes on one side and the brilliant blue-green waters of the Gulf of Suez on the other , gives evidence of the Egyptian commando landings that were presumably to ease the way southward for the main force . General Gavish said several hundred commandos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and Sharm el Sheik , at the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula . The general and the unit commanders who were committed against the commando groups , usually numbering 12 , spoke slightingly of their will to fight and the results they achieved .. Most were either killed or captured , General Gavish said . More than 100 miles south lie the oil fields of Abu Rodes , another Egyptian target early in the war . In an air raid in which , a local commander said , two big Soviet-made bombers participated , a number of Israelis were killed and wounded . Work was halted for several days and families were evacuated . In discussions with Israeli soldiers , from the highest down , they frequently returned to the contention that the war was halted two or three days too soon , depriving them of a full victory in a war they say was forced on them . " The cease-fire was their mazal , " a soldier at Sharm el Sheikh said , using the word for " luck . " " They started it and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front .
