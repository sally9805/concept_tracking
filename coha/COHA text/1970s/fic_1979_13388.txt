( HENRY is discovered on the telephone in a state of some agitation . Refusing a job has always been hard on him . ) HENRY No . Absolutely not . That 's my final word .

The whole country has amnesia , it 's changed so much I do n't know who I am any more . So what ? So a man marries a woman , they have a couple of kids , they break up , she goes a bit wild , he loses his job , he ends up canoeing down a river in a overpriced buckskin jacket . Why write about that ? What 's the difference between them and anybody else ? You want to know what the difference is , at least the one I figured out ? Everybody watched .

He looks after him for a moment , then addresses the audience . ) HENRY You know , when I first came to Ottawa , I expected it to be like those TV press conferences , you know the kind . . . politicians on one side , journalists on the other and everybody 's on the attack . You could never imagine these people in the same room with each other . I arrived on Parliament Hill to find a small town of about three hundred people . The doers and the watchers all mixed in together exchanging information , drinks and sometimes even wives for mutual benefit . And I learned the fine lines of conduct where you can drink with a man one night , write about him the next , and look him right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 're never enemies . Gossip was king , not politics . As for the rest , we were a pretty boring small town . . . I mean , most of the MPs were still staying at the YMCA , I 'd watch Diefenbaker and Pearson hacking and hewing away at each other like two old gladiators . The biggest thing that happened was the Flag Debate . Remember that one ? Dief calling on the old powers of the British Empire only to find out they did n't give a shit any longer . We had nothing going for us except a certain cynical satirical sense of humour about how ridiculous we were . And we 'd cast those longing glances across the border to you know where . Then , all of a sudden , out of the clear blue sky , comes this guy . . . and he 's sexy and classy and brilliant and athletic and liberal-minded and adventurous ! New York was jealous . . . and the bugger spoke French ! Guys like that did n't usually dirty their hands with politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose to rule . We were flattered . And because he was sexy and classy and athletic . . . we became sexy and classy and athletic . You 're from New York , are you ? Too bad . . . Pierre Trudeau ? Oh , yeah , just another typical Canadian . French ? Sure , most of us are bilangu parfait . Sexy ? Classy ? It 's the long winters . And you could n't understand a god-damn thing the guy was saying . . . Rows of journalists down at the library . . . Who the hell is Loqueville ? Or is it Toqueville ? Has anyone read Buddhism and the Natural Man ? It was fantastic . I loved the guy . And all the while I was watching him , enjoying him , I had this almost eerie sensation that things were going to get unusually complicated . . . I just did n't know how . . . p. 8 p. 9 Act 1 , Scene 5 Scene Five 17 Magazine ( MAGGIE is pensive in her " good girl " dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling someone else 's story . Later she becomes more desperate to be where " it 's happening . " ) MAGGIE It was n't as if she was timid or afraid , it was as if , as she went towards what was expected , she went just a little too far , beyond the delicate point of naturalness , giving everything she did and said a strange air of falsity that she herself questioned at every turn . VOICE Margaret . You 're trying just a bit too hard . MAGGIE No , it 's what they want . . . Hello , Daddy . I 've got your pipe and slippers . Hello , Mr. Jenkins . Daddy , is it all right if I sit on Mr. Jenkins ' lap ? I 'm glad you think I 'm pretty as a picture . I have to go now to meet the captain of the football team . . . I . . .

MAGGIE With two thousand dollars ' worth of Dad 's money , but I 'm not going to spend it . . . It 's off to Morocco and Marrakesh , really strange food and really strange dope . VOICE Margaret , you still sound like a phony . MAGGIE I 'm trying . . . Living a communal existence where you pretend you do n't need any privacy at all . Of course , I 'll make love to you , I 'm not afraid of my body . You 're not afraid of yours and I 'll even enjoy it . And I 'll make love to you and you and you and you . . . Standing in a gold-domed square with some guy going " Nyahhh . . . " How come all of a sudden everybody looks like something out of a Bible school picture ? How come they think I 'm the Virgin Mary ?

That 's for real ! p. 12 Act 1 , Scene 6 Scene Six Les Snobs ( PIERRE speaks as though discovering this person himself , almost surprised at his own actions , physicalizing every step along the way . He begins by zipping up a black leather jacket . ) PIERRE Imagine a man , no , a child , about three years old and his parents are telling him to go to bed , and he says , " No , you 're wrong .

Five years old , hearing somewhere that fresh air is good for you , up goes the window . ( He begins to deep breathe . ) Six years old , the 5-BX plan , self discipline , twenty minutes every day . Why ? To be strong . What for ? To fight . Who ? I do n't know yet , but I 'm going to find out very soon . . . Sitting in the classroom . . . the Battle of the Plains of Abraham .

What for ? To fight . Who ? First myself , and then . . . anyone who dares me . . . Off to find adventure , danger , the war zones . . . China , Vietnam , Palestine . I get arrested . Why ? To find out what it 's like . And then , it 's the internal journey of the soul , and so it 's Buddhism and chanting and yoga . All right , body , soul , mind , all tuned , all tingling . . .

The absurdity of the situation is beginning to dawn on her . ) MAGGIE Oh , no ! I look like a Barbie doll . Why did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you bring up that stuff . . . All this fuss , for what ? Just another corrupt politician . I was even going to put that junk on my nails . I ca n't believe it . I gave up all this materialistic crap a long time ago , matching handbags , high-heeled . . . shoes . ( A moment of appreciation , quickly squashed . ) Look at this dress , we could have lived for six months in Morocco for what this cost . It 's immoral . ( She struggles with the dress , then stands with it over her head and laughs . ) It 's like a viewfinder made of lace . ( The dress slips down over her head and she looks at herself in an imaginary mirror . ) I do n't know why I 'm so nervous , I guess if I want to , I can look all right . . . Do n't answer the doorbell . And cool the giggling , all right ? ( She opens the door . ) He 's so little , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look at him . Oh , no , he 's offering me his arm . Thank you . You 're wearing a cravat ! Oh , no , I just do n't know anybody that wears cravats . . . And a month ago in Morocco , we were n't wearing anything at all . ( The curtain opens to reveal a table set for an elegant dinner . ) Oh , great , it 's the kind of restaurant my parents go to . No , no that 's fine . He 's pushing my chair in , I hope I do n't land on my ass . . . Thank you . I 'm pressing my knees together so hard my thighs hurt . What did I take in university ? Political Science , I took Politi . . . Bad choice , Margaret . Did you really win a contest for having the most beautiful legs in the world ? . . . He thinks I 'm an idiot . How strange , it 's as if I 'm falling into his eyes . . . one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me something . . . that he 's shy too ! It 's as if every word I say is a jewel ! . . . It 's like he 's massaging me from the inside ! I can tell you anything . What were my courses like in university ? Well , Pierre , they 're about a whole generation of people just stepping back and saying , " Hey , hold on . " They 're about people looking at war and money and corruption and politics and saying , " Look , there 's got to be a better way . " About everybody feeling a part of a whole movement , going , " Do n't trust anyone over thirty ! ! " ( She realizes she 's put her foot in it . ) Basically , Pierre , I just do really a lot of dope . . . He 's laughing . He 's not shocked at all . He likes me talking like this . Is he an old man or what ? . . . Flash , flash , flash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , that 's all right , you can take my picture . Oh , God , I hope I look all right . . . Flash , flash , flash , flash . . . Funny , signing those autographs , he looked like Clark Gable . And a while back , talking politics , he reminded me of that guy with the khaki shorts that used to follow me around Morocco . And just then , ordering the wine , he looked like Ricardo Montalban . He changes , frame to frame to frame . It 's like watching television ! He 's making a funny , little old-fashioned bow that matches the cravat . It 's so cute . He 's asking me to dance . " Of course , I 'll dance with you . . . " ( They dance to a ballad by Maggie 's favourite rock and roll band . ) Do you know what this reminds me of ? One night when I was thirteen years old , my mother and father and I went down to the rec room , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dance . Dancing with you is like dancing with my father . p. 15 PIERRE You 're making me feel old . MAGGIE I 'm sorry . You could never be old . PIERRE I 'm two years older than your mother . MAGGIE You 'll never be old . . . I can feel his body underneath the suit . Strong , but not like a football player 's . Flexible , like a dancer 's . ( She giggles . ) PIERRE What are you laughing at ? MAGGIE Oh , I 'm just not used to dancing this way . PIERRE You intimidate me when you laugh . MAGGIE I intimidate the Prime Minister of Canada ! Hey , you would n't be intimidated by a string of Mack trucks . PIERRE You have soft hair . MAGGIE He thinks I have soft hair . . . How much do I want ? Do n't blow it , Margaret , just open your eyes wide and make him think of hyacinths . It 's like flowers in springtime and every atom in my body feeling alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like really good acid and being on mescaline for eight hours , sitting up in a tree , thinking you 're a bird . . . Come on Pierre , baby , let 's dance all night ! PIERRE Margaret ? Do n't you think we should be going ? Everyone 's left . p. 16 MAGGIE I did n't even notice . Is n't that a line out of some movie ? PIERRE I do n't know . I do n't often go to movies . MAGGIE Are you going to take me right home ? PIERRE I 'm a well-brought up boy , I get my eight hours ' sleep . I have a busy day tomorrow . Yes , I suppose so . MAGGIE I mean . . . where are you staying ? PIERRE At the nearest CP hotel . . . it 's Canadian . . . It 's a joke . . . MAGGIE Far-out , Pierre . That 's really good .

Both are slightly uncomfortable , aware of the unusualness of their situation . ) PIERRE Well , Henry , you 're probably wondering why I 've brought you here to this out-of-the-way bar , in this out-of-the-way part of Ottawa . HENRY Yeah , yeah , to tell you the truth , I had been wondering why you brought me here , seeing as how I 've only spoken with you about twice .

PIERRE No. p. 18 HENRY Sorry . . . How do you feel about her , or something like that ? I do n't know . PIERRE I do n't know , I 'm completely confused . I 'm wandering around Ottawa in a kind of a daze . I keep thinking of flowers , but I ca n't remember what kind . I walk into Parliament and sit there facing Bob Stanfield , and last week , he and the entire Conservative Party transformed into Margaret .

HENRY When guys like you fall , they really go , do n't they , Pierre ? Sorry , not funny . All right , you want to know what I think ? Man to man , and not Prime Minister to journalist ? I think it 's a really stupid idea . Look , most of the women in the country vote for you because they think you 're going to come through the bedroom window one night .

Look , I 've been around enough politicians . It 's okay to say something just to get in . Oh , no . . . Oh , no , you do , you really believe it . PIERRE Here 's the voice of youth , of optimism , a true daughter of the age of Aquarius . Margaret , of course I believe in it , it only makes sense . Why do they just want to touch me ? Why is the whole country at my feet ? Because I 'm the first guy that ever walked into the House of Commons of this country with an idea . . . of how a whole society should work . Discussion , philosophy and idealism creating a new order . We are on the threshold of a model of harmony and vitality for the world . Emmanuel Mounier writes of " creative democracy . " If we could only just believe in the possibility . p. 26 MAGGIE But you 're talking about Ottawa . Ottawa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were saying . I 'm sorry , I know , you mean . . . change or the Revolution . Sure , I believe in it . I know lots of people that do . Sure , I have a vision of a world , but it 's not practical . But sometimes early in the morning , I can see it so clear . I see a wood , and sunlight streaming down , and people dancing naked like fauns , dappled sunshine on their bodies , fearless . . . but I do n't know where they pay their taxes , or get their pay cheques . But you know something about those people ? They 're totally free . PIERRE Well , all right , maybe there 's a place for that in " The Just Society . " Maybe on sunny days , I should walk into Parliament and say , " Everybody out , all the MPs walk along the Ottawa River , take off your clothes , jump in and make love to your wives , or your girlfriends or someone . " Just think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want to know what happens if you put a Communist , a Socialist , and some guy from the Canadian Legion together in the same room and you make them fight it out . . . And you are the irrationality that perhaps somewhere along the line I have lost . You are the jolt of electricity that will set the whole thing going like some kind of ecstatic merry-go-round . MAGGIE I do n't know . . . Why do n't you call it something like , " The Psychedelic , Nutso , Let-It-All-Hang-Out Society . " p. 27 PIERRE You 're being silly . It 's " The Reasonable , Yet Tolerant Society . " MAGGIE You ca n't tolerate freedom ! PIERRE All right . All right . Then it 's " The Reasonable , Yet Impulsive Just Society . " MAGGIE I 'm still a bit worried , and I think if you want to keep your little jolt of electricity , you 'll have to chase your wife , outside , and we 're gon na have to . . . do it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 28 Act 2 , Scene 2 Scene Two October Crisis ( HENRY catches PIERRE outside the Parliament Buildings . He and his tape recorder are worried about freedom . ) HENRY Sir , sir . . . What 's this with the War Measures Act ? What are all these guys with all these guns doing running around ? PIERRE Have n't you noticed ? HENRY Yeah , I noticed . I wondered why you people decided to have them ? PIERRE Well , what 's your worry ? HENRY I 'm not worried , but you seem to be . PIERRE If you 're not worried , then I 'm not worried . HENRY All right , I 'm worried . I 'm worried about living in a society where you have to resort to that kind of thing . PIERRE It seems natural that if people are going to be abducted , we should take steps to protect them . What would you do if another minister were to be abducted ? HENRY Well , that is n't the . . . PIERRE Is it your position that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FLQ ? p. 29 HENRY No . That is not my position at all . PIERRE What is your position ? HENRY My position is you do n't give in to any of them . PIERRE But you do n't protect yourself against the possibility of blackmail ? HENRY Well , how can you protect everybody , without turning the place into a police state ? PIERRE You ca n't . But are you therefore suggesting we should protect no one ? ( HENRY is confused , then rallies . ) HENRY Right . PIERRE That 's your position ? HENRY Right . . . sir . Sir , sir . . . Sir , all right , maybe I explained it badly , but what you 're talking about to me is choices , and my choice is to live in a society that 's free and democratic , and that means you do n't have guys with guns running around in it . PIERRE Correct . HENRY And that means I might have to take the chance that a guy like you may be abducted . PIERRE Precisely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , despite the protests of a few weak-kneed bleeding hearts , who just do n't like the look of a few guns . As far as I 'm concerned , they can just go on and bleed . p. 30 HENRY How far are you willing to go with that ? PIERRE Just watch me ! p. 31 Act 2 , Scene 3 Scene Three Walk Alone ( Rain is falling and MAGGIE is trying to deal with the servants . She wants to rid herself of the feeling she is being followed . ) MAGGIE Mrs. Trudeau is being difficult today . No , no , I do n't want to wear my galoshes . No , thank you , I do n't want a rain hat or an umbrella . Do n't you understand ? I 'm from B.C. We like the rain . I just want to go for a walk by my . . .

These Easterners will never understand . There 's a place I like , down by the river , where the sewage dumps in . It looks like a waterfall . There 's 24 Sussex Drive , way up on the cliff . They 're watching me from the windows . And there 's the spiral of a church we do n't even go to , and there are the Parliament Buildings , where he is . Funny , there 's a kind of smoke that comes out of those chimneys coloured like a faerie dust . Sometimes it 's red and sometimes it 's blue and sometimes it gold . That 's when he 's talking . Political dust , and pretty soon , it gets all over you and you 've got an axe to grind or a position to defend . Hey , what 's that ? What 's that movement on the water ? It looks like wings , like wings beating underneath the water . Pierre would say , " No , Margaret . It 's just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the surface . " But I know it 's wings . Is it possible to think if someone is always watching you ? ( She runs , hides , and comes back . Then , she speaks to the guards . ) Sorry , I just wanted to hide . I just wanted to hide . They have no idea of what that means . . . Do I ? Someone new watching , a new maid . . . Oh , boy . No . It 's me . It 's me . . . Watching Mrs. Trudeau standing just a little bit close to the water . It 's me , all dressed up in my Yves St. Laurent gown , a monument of good taste . It 's me watching me , down by the river , a monument of bad taste . She wants me up there . . . She 's beckoning . . . ( Silently , she mouths the words . . . ) No way . . . p. 32 p. 33 Act 2 , Scene 4 Scene Four Boredom ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it work . ) PIERRE Margaret , I 'm home . As Heraclitus said , " You never walk in the same river twice , " and that 's what being Prime Minister of Canada is like . The only way to stay alive is to avoid their wish to define you . Am I a millionaire who 's never worked a day in his life , or a dangerous Communist ? Qubecois or a sellout ? They 'll never find out . I 'm even enjoying the process of their disillusionment in me . How perfect it is ! The very things they loved in me six years ago , they ca n't stand in me now . I think what irritates them is the sight of a guy having a good time being Prime Minister . How I love it ! MAGGIE I just got bored , just this moment . A frozen moment in time . Boredom came crashing through the ceiling and landed right there on the carpet like a piece of rotting meat . What am I doing with this man ? We have nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just opened , hundreds of thousands of them , the sunlight streaming through . Nothing is certain , anything is possible . I could be a journalist or an actress . . . PIERRE Margaret , what 's going on ? MAGGIE All the doors just opened ! p. 34 PIERRE Congratulations ! I 've been waiting for this moment to happen to you , when you stand there , full of self-confidence , and you watch all those possibilities open up . And you say , " I 'll take a bit of this , a bit of that . " Experience it to the end of your synapse . It 's a wonderful feeling . MAGGIE I could be a nuclear scientist . PIERRE Of course , you could be a nuclear scientist . MAGGIE Or a rock singer . I could sing like Tina Turner . PIERRE Who ? MAGGIE Tina Turner . She 's a rock singer , Pierre .

They have met in the street by chance . ) HENRY I still have n't figured out how you managed to drag me in here to get drunk with you at the Press Club of all places . I was walking along , minding my own business . . . MAGGIE Henry , you said you wanted to get drunk . HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , it was okay to have a couple of drinks with you boys on the campaign plane and on the trip to Cuba . . . Who am I going to hang loose with , Mrs. Michener ?

Sometimes I dress up in this little garter belt and . . . HENRY Margaret , Margaret ! There 's a limit to " off the record . " MAGGIE I 've known these people for years , are n't they my friends ? HENRY No . MAGGIE I know what you 're talking about . ( She breaks into a mimed relationship with the camera . At first , it has a mind of its own , viewing her at its own whim .

He 's not cold and he 's not unfeeling . As a matter of fact , he 's taught me a lot about loving . . . No , I was n't in the hospital for a cold or something . I 'm under severe emotional stress and psychiatric care , and I think that anyone else in that position should tell people and break the taboos . Naked on the beach . . . That 's a funny question to ask , but I 'll answer it . The trouble is , my nipples . . . Have you ever breast-fed three children ? No , eh ? Well , your nipples go all brown and sticky on the edges . . . What do you want ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Is that what you want ? Have n't you figured this out yet ? This is the snake pit . Do n't trust them . Especially , do n't trust me . I do n't know why , but you 're news , front page , just like your husband . You have got to watch out . The guy that interviews you has got to be his own censor . You 'll say anything . It 's frightening . Here , let me tell you a story . One day , I 'm down in the library looking up some god-damn thing your husband said , something about Erasmus , and I come across Erasmus 's letter to a young man going to court . It has advice in it like , " Confide in no one , yet seem to confide in all , never lower your position or become familiar , or you 'll be hated for it . " That 's it , you 're in court . Everybody gets weird when they talk about people in power . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That Trudeau screws RCMP officers under the bed , that you get off on it , that your kids were artificially inseminated . . . I 'm telling you , this gets heavy , watch out ! ( PIERRE enters . ) PIERRE Margaret , I just received a call from my press secretary . I think it 's time we were going home . MAGGIE Oh , just a few more minutes . Come on , I 'm humanizing your image , and believe me , it needs to be humanized . It 's okay , Henry is taking good care of me. p. 39 HENRY Yeah . It 's all right , sir . I 'm keeping an eye on her . Do n't worry about a thing . PIERRE You 're keeping an eye on her ? You 'll exploit a fine person who happens to trust you . She 'll speak freely to you , you 'll write it down , she 'll look like a fool , and you 'll make money off her . MAGGIE No . That 's not what he meant at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . Marg , you do n't have to defend me . It 's just your husband 's usual position on journalists . I think it 's about time you realized , sir , that you 've been better treated by the journalists of this country than any leader in the Western World . PIERRE Margaret , I 'm really not interested in a scene , the car is waiting . MAGGIE I know this sounds terrible , but it 's getting exciting and I want to know what happens . HENRY Your wife was starting to look forty-five years old . Tonight , look at her . Her eyes are glowing , her cheeks are pink , she 's starting to look very . . . good . Just let the lady have a good time , will you ? PIERRE Margaret , you 're my wife and we 're going home . HENRY Aha ! I knew it . You 're a dictator in the House and a dictator in the house . Let me tell you something . I do n't like the way you treat your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists , and I do n't like the way you treat the country . p. 40 MAGGIE Hey . . . what are you fighting about ? I like the way both of you treat me . PIERRE Speaking of the country . . . if I make a mistake , I 'm responsible to twenty-two million people . Who are you responsible to ? I speak issues and you write personality . And if arrogance sells newspapers , then I 'm arrogant . You 're not a political analyst , you are paid to make me look like a fool , and I 'm sorry , I do n't enjoy being made to look like a fool . MAGGIE Stop fighting . You 're making me like it . HENRY And who am I to criticize the great Pierre Elliot Trudeau ? Just some poor schmuck off the street . You 're the guy that 's making a whole country feel stupid . You 're giving us a worse inferiority complex than we had before . Now , we feel inferior to you . . . You betrayed me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some change was going to happen within the system , and then , you shattered it . And that 's why we 're out to get you , because you personally betrayed me , personally . MAGGIE Henry , you 're acting like a betrayed lover . Do n't you understand ? I 'm the lover here . PIERRE And I 'm the one betrayed . I came in here with new ideas all laid out . There was O.F.Y. and L.I.P . and Information Canada . A latticework throughout the country for people to take hold and start believing in their own democracy . But I went a bit slow for you . You got scared and you retreated to your official position  --  " All politicians are crooks , they 're just in it for another vote , they 're trying to put one over on you . " And you undermined the very basis of my credibility . You weakened a country I was trying to strengthen . p. 41 HENRY No , you became corrupt . You . . . elitist ! PIERRE You barbarian ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vestige of a Neanderthal Age ! . . . Margaret , it 's time to go . MAGGIE I think Henry 's a little bit upset . Why do n't you just let me talk to him by myself for a minute ? You can just wait in the car . Okay ? ( PIERRE leaves . ) Henry , men are so funny when they fight . Why are n't you supposed to talk about politics , religion , or sex ? Because they 're all the same thing . You 're not going to print anything that happened tonight , are you ? HENRY Margaret , is it possible that you 're not as naive as I think you are ? Are you trying to pull my strings ? Is it conceivable that you are trying to get somewhere ? Are you capable of ambition ? Why am I in love with you ? Why does the whole Press Gallery have fantasies of dashing off to save you from your husband or your children or something ? We 've been protecting you for years . Did you do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know if you really want me to print what happened tonight or not . . . MAGGIE Henry , how could you say such things to me ? You have no idea how much you 've hurt me . And whether you print tonight or not . . . of course . . . it 's up to you . . . p. 42 Act 2 , Scene 6 Scene Six The Fight ( PIERRE and MAGGIE are discovered mid-argument . Behind them hangs an invisible quilt with the phrase " Reason over Passion . " ) PIERRE I received a bill from Creed 's the other day . . . MAGGIE Now we 're going to talk about money , but it 's not about money , is it Pierre ? PIERRE I also wanted to discuss your relationship with our children . Justin mentioned to me the other day . . . MAGGIE You were speaking to Justin . . . You 're using the children as spies ! I thought I was paranoid , but I 'm not paranoid enough for Ottawa . PIERRE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have everything you 've always wanted and that continues . I do n't understand what could possibly be the matter with you . MAGGIE You 're taking away my right to complain ! I do n't like the beautiful house . I do n't like the beautiful job . I do n't like what I see happening to you . You 're starting to look like those cartoons . PIERRE We explained things to each other . I told you what our life would be like . We made a contract , an agreement . You 've just got to be reasonable . p. 43 MAGGIE Reasonable ! Do n't say that word , " reasonable . " I 'm not feeling very " reasonable " tonight . All I can see is that quilt with your motto , " Reason over Passion , " written right on to it . ( She mimes pulling the letters off the quilt and throwing them on him . ) Here 's an " R " and an " E " and an " A. " Look at it ! That woman made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pink . It 's got butterflies all over it . It 's a joke about a silly man who lives by a silly motto . There 's only one motto . . . " Be Here Now . " PIERRE Is that what you 've come to ? Destroying a work of art ? MAGGIE After all these years , I do n't even know if you 're disturbed or not . I want out . I want out of Confederation ! ! I 'm so sick , sick , sick to death of Canada . You know , John A. Macdonald made a railroad and we made a marriage , and he laid it from East to West , from sea to shining sea . . . You know , those guys at Confederation , they were drunk . They did n't know what they were doing . John A. put them up to it , and they signed this piece of paper , and we ended up with Canada . I 'm sick of timidity and mediocrity , and Bright 's Canadian Wine , fake Inuit carving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in this ridiculous country , strung like a clothesline across the American border . Let 's admit it : the Americans have always had more fun . Let 's go there . No one was meant to live in this climate . Look at you . You 're the epitome of a cold land . Let 's go someplace warm , where people laugh and cry and hug and shout and dance in the streets . Come on , let 's go . I 'll pack the kids . We 'll just go . Do n't call anyone . Say it was all a mistake . Come on , look , we can still make it . I know you want to . Oh , please . . . Please . . . p. 44 PIERRE You told me you wanted it all . You spoke of shaping destiny . Here is destiny . Feeling like a strong central column , springing from the guts of the land , with two arms outstretched , spanning four thousand miles of diversity and contradiction and space . You and I . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves . This is immortality . Stay with me , stay with me . MAGGIE You almost sucked me in again . You know , through all this , there 's only one thing that seems to make any sense at all . Having fun . . . you remember ? Just having fun . ( She dashes off. ) p. 45 Act 2 , Scene 7 Scene Seven Enter My Emotional World ( HENRY has reached the end of his rope . He wants Pierre 's soul on a platter . He finds himself in Pierre 's inner sanctum . ) HENRY You have to admit , when she went AWOL , she picked the best . It 's become important to me , very important , to find out what he feels . I mean , I watched that guy for nine years . I see him more often than I see my own wife . . . But that 's the story of my divorce and that 's not this one . . . I mean , you 're always trying to figure out what that tricky bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're even right . Except for this time . I have n't a clue . For some reason , I have to know if he even cares or not . I have to . Okay , so let 's work it out . . . So . . . so . . . he 's in his office , right ? And you could pick many points of pain along the way , but let 's be cruel . Let 's pick one . Let 's pick that weekend . So , he 's in his office , right , and she 's just left , and at some point or other , some poor flack had to make a phone call and say something like . . . " Sir , your wife has run off with the Rolling Stones . You know , The Bad Boys of Rock ? Heroin , court cases . . . She 's staying at the same hotel , same floor , and she has n't mentioned you lately . We just thought you should know . " I mean , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time like that ? What did he feel ? I have to know . . . ( PIERRE appears. ) p. 46 PIERRE Well , why do n't you ask me ? Come in . Enter my emotional world . You may ask me any question that you choose . HENRY You 're on . But I warn you , I 'm going to dig deep . . . Okay , so that phone call happened . What was going on inside of you ? PIERRE I was alone , she had just left , the phone did ring . . . ( He reveals himself for the first time as he listens on the telephone , shaken , unable to hide the depth of the impact . ) " No . . . I . . . I do n't think there 's any reason for a statement at this time , thank you . " And amid all the pain and fear of being called a cuckold . . . there was an absurd sense of the perfection of the cosmic joke . I mean , a woman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give her credit . It 's perfect . HENRY All right . So , it 's kind of funny , I got that . But , what else ? What does a guy like you do when you 're alone and in pain ? What did you do that night ? PIERRE Do you really want to know ? ( He closes the curtains and doors . ) I wait until I am completely private . . . ( He gets down on his knees . ) " In the Name of the Father , And the Son , and the Holy Spirit , Amen . Dear Lord , I am in a state of such complete darkness and I have no idea where to turn , or what the answers are . I humbly beseech your aid in trying to find some way of strength in this abyss . I also ask you to help me to keep from killing her when she gets back . In the name of the Father , and the Son , and the Holy . . . " p. 47 HENRY Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . PIERRE You know something , Henry ? As we were going through all those horrendous fights , my wife was at my feet , and she was crying and screaming and wailing and literally banging her head against the wall , and I stood there , frozen , in the classic pose of man , locked in my own gender , not knowing whether to go to her and comfort her , or leave because it 's too personal to watch , or hit her , or what to do . And my dominant emotion was jealousy . . . that she could be so free . Perhaps that 's the tragedy of the oppressor . There is a certain joy in it . Perhaps for the first time , I feel a part of my entire society . . . The Old World is behind and the New World is a bit late in coming , and I ask , with all of us , " What are we going to do about marriage ? " ( He breaks the mood . ) It 's worth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what you wanted to see ? Poor Henry . You have never known what you wanted to ask me . But it 's all right . I forgive you . ( PIERRE blesses HENRY . HENRY , confused , grabs his coat . ) HENRY How do I get out of here ? ( HENRY runs out. ) p. 48 Act 2 , Scene 8 Scene Eight Disco-Election ( Raunchy rock music heralds the night of the May 1979 election .

MAN 'S VOICE I find her totally unattractive . She 's a flaky broad . WOMAN 'S VOICE She 's put the feminist cause back five years .

From the bulk of the returns in from Atlantic and Central Canada , the Conservatives have picked up a net gain of a couple of dozen seats in Southern Ontario , and the Decision Desk is predicting a Progressive Conservative minority government . ( The music stops . ) Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and his Liberal Party have been voted out of office . ( MAGGIE stops dancing and turns to the audience. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . it 's Margaret Trudeau , is it ? Well , come on . Everybody 's up there on their little soap boxes .

The marrieds , the divorced , the Lefties , the Righties ? Well , come on , I 'm the woman that 's offended everybody . Oh , we 're so together , are n't we , ladies ? We 're so on top of it all .
