txt While Israelis debate the question of " who. is a Jew ? " Palestinian Arabs are discussing the parallel issue of " who is a Pales-tinian ? " The provisional answer of some appears to be that " Jews living in today 's Israel can become Palestinians if they want to . " This Arab review of relations with Jews was highlighted by the 10-day visit to Moscow in February by Yasir Arafat , chairman of the Palestine ? Liberation Organization ( PLO ) and leader of Al Fatah , the largest guerrilla group . It also coincides with a concerted Soviet campaign , led partially by Soviet Jews , against Zionism and the state of Israel ; with the debates - inside Israel , about what constitutes Jewish religion and nationality ; and with the backwash of American ' Jewish demonstrations against President Pompidou of France : Lutfl al Khouly , ? an Egyptian editor who accompanied the Arafat mission to Moscow , ? has described a conversation between ? unnamed Russians and the Palestinians concerning Jews . Equal- terms , As ' Mr. al Khouly tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviets ' ; asked . what the palestinian organizations meant when they proposed establishing a new Palestine . state where Christians , . Muslims , . and Jews would live on equal terms . " How , " asked one of their Soviet hosts , " do You define Jews ? " According to Mr. ' al Khouly , the reply was : ? " All those who today are called the people of Israel . " This would be the first clear Palestinian statement that all of the 2.5 million Jews now living in Israel would be invited to be // Arabs make offer to Jews // come Palestinian citizens after creation of the new state . Most past Arab interpretations have been that the guerrilla movements , some of which now are successfully recruiting anti-Zionist Jews , would accept in their hypothetical new state only those Jews who had lived in the British-mandated territory of Palestine before Israel 's creation in 1948 . Amendment considered Dr. Youssef Sayegh , a Palestinian economist close to the PLO leadership , says that the Palestinian attitude toward Jews has become progressively more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 in The Times , of London , to a statement by Eitan Ruppin , minister at the Israeli embassy in London . Mr. Ruppin had referred to the PLO 's national charter to argue that the Palestinians were hostile toward Jews as such . " Because the objective of a unitary , democratic state in Palestine is not easy to attack , " Dr. Sayegh wrote , " we are now witnessing a concerted attempt by Israeli Government spokesmen to cast doubt upon the sincerity of the Palestinian resistance movement 's intentions . " Dr. Sayegh said the PLO was considering an amendment to its charter . He added that it would express " the intention of making it more clearly inclusive of all Jews , with . out any qualification at all , except that they should free themselves from colonialist attitudes and accept to live in peace with Muslim and Christian Palestinians . " Zionist invasion ' The PLO charter now states that " the Jews who used to live under normal conditions in Palestine until the Zionist invasion of the country are to be considered Palestinians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1948 to 1949 war , or the war of 1967 constitute the " Zionist invasion . " However , the preceding charter article says that " the Palestinians are those Arab citizens who under normal conditions used to live in Palestine until 1947 ; they include those who remained there as well as those who were evicted . The offspring of an Arab Palestinian parent , since that date , whether born in Palestine or outside it , are regarded as Palestinians . " The amended charter would state clearly that all persons of Jewish religion now in Israel would be accepted as citizens of the proposed new Palestinian ' democratic state , . as Mr. Arafat is said to have told the Russians . The new amendment is likely to be submitted and adopted at the next Palestine National Council meeting due to be held in Cairo this month or next . Mr. Arafat and some of his aides have recently been assuring journalists and others that this invitation to Jews is seiously meant , and not merely a tactical maneuver . Last Dec. 31 Al Fatah said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that several Arab governments , after requests by Al Fatah , had agreed to welcome back Jews who had left homes and property to emigrate to Israel . Al Fatah did not name the governments , but since then Iraq and Syria have published statements assuring Jews of equal rights . Iraq announced March 4 the lifting of earlier restrictions on Jews . These restrictions included the removal of telephones , the closing of shops , and dismissal from public office . The Iraqi Interior Minister Lt. Gen. Saleh Mahdi Ammash , issued the new instructions , the Iraqi New Agency said . Arab news media extensively covered a Moscow meeting March 4 between 52 Soviet Jews and 400 Soviet and foreign newsmen on the usually taboo question of Jews in the Soviet Union . Pro-Arab purpose The ' leaders included Soviet Deputy Premier Veniamin Dymshits , five generals , and four professors . Most contended that anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union had ended after the death of Stalin in 1952 . A French news commentary published here analyzed the purposes of the meeting as a " denunciation of Zionism " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Zionism 's nonexistence in Russia . " This demonstration is to serve as a guide to both extreme wings of the population : Insufficiently assimilated Jewish elements are thus isolated , and non-Jews are served notice that they must not confuse anti-Zionism , which is encouraged , and anti-Semitism , which is prohibited .
