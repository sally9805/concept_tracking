RAFFERTY AND THE GOLD DUST TWINS <P> Directed by DICK RICHARDS Screenplay by JOHN KAYE <P> Rafferty ( Alan Arkin ) is a depressed drunk who has spent 20 boring years in the Marine Corps , and now quietly despises his job administering driving tests for the California department of motor vehicles . The " twins " are Mac ( Sally Kellerman ) , who is drifting around the country vaguely looking for a job singing country music , and Frisbee ( Mackenzie Phillips ) , a teen-age orphan who is just plain drifting . Frisbee may not be as tough as she thinks she is , but she is definitely not as appealing as the people who made this movie seem to think she must be . <P> The girls meet Rafferty in a park where he has gone to spend his lunch hour sucking on his pint of rye . They inexplicably abduct him ( using a gun loaded with blanks ) , let him escape and then permit him to rejoin them when he decides that careening around the country may be more interesting than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably it is-but barely , since the relationship that develops among the trio is predictable to anyone having the faintest familiarity with road pictures . Rafferty and Mac become transient lovers , the better to serve as surrogate parents for Frisbee , thus buffing some of the raw edginess off her personality . After a while Mac wanders off with a bandleader , the cops return the kid to an orphanage , and Rafferty rescues her so that they can once more set forth on the road to nowhere . <P> In some contexts one might be led to imagine that Rafferty has obscene designs on the child-woman , but not here . It is an essential premise of movies like this that losers are sweet , which is one of our more boring cinematic conceits . So is the inevitable contrast drawn between the principals and the harsh , empty , neon-lit landscapes through which they move . Following form , all their encounters are of course with minor characters , who are either moronic or teetering on the edge of psychopathic violence-sometimes both . This movie seems to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determinedly picturesque western ( The Culpepper Cattle Co. ) , can do gas stations , sleazy motels and roadhouses as well . He even manages to include , as a sort of director 's showcase , the standard Las Vegas sequence , in which that afflicted city is once again visualized as the American dream perceived through a fever . <P> The film is technically competent enough and in its small way inoffensive . But it is all familiar surfaces . Needed are people , characters of a little depth or originality , or , at the least , some fresh angle of directorial vision to pique our curiosity , arrest our attention . Neither , alas , is available in Rafferty and the Gold Dust Twins .
