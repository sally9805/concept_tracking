There have been numerous occasions in TIME 'S 55 years of publication when the editors wished that the magazine could have several covers . This was such a week . The Supreme Court 's historic ruling on the Allan Bakke case was at the top of the news , but two other subjects provided the grist for major stories . <P> One was an interview with Jimmy Carter conducted by TIME Washington Bureau Chief Robert Ajemian . Moving casually from his Executive study to the high-hedged patio outside , Carter answered questions about the direction and depth of his leadership at a time when opinion polls reveal increasing public dissatisfaction . Says Ajemian : " Carter seemed very durable , never exasperated . <P> Even with long , detailed explanations , he speaks in perfect sentences . There is a precision to his talk that does n't really hit you until you look back over a transcript of his conversation . " <P> A second was the report on Cuba by TIME Diplomatic Correspondent Strobe Talbott , who spent eleven days on the island . Talbott gathered notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and met with Fidel Castro for 2 hours of freewheeling discussion . " Most heads of state I 've encountered seem weighted down by their jobs , " reports Talbott . " Not the Cuban Premier . He obviously has a lot of fun being Fidel Castro-and he does it well . " <P> But the week 's most important story originated with a 38-year-old white engineer 's petition to enter a California medical school . For 18 months , TIME 'S Hays Gorey , our principal Washington correspondent on the story , had collected information about Bakke 's lawsuit . He also interviewed dozens of high-ranking officials involved with affirmative-action and other civil rights programs . When the Supreme Court 's ruling came , it seemed more significant to Gorey for what it did not answer than for what it did . Reflects Gorey : " Before the Bakke ruling , the question was how America could remedy the effects of past discrimination without indulging in present and future discrimination . And that is still the question . " This week 's cover story , written by Edwin Warner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new climate of the Bakke decision .
