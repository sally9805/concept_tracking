At the halfway mark , he still sails an erratic course <P> He is markedly older in appearance now , his wispy , blown-dry hair a shade grayer than it was a year ago . The sagging skin around his neck adds years to his appearance and is accentuated by a recent loss of weight , the result of his 30 miles of weekly jogging to ward off the fatigue of his job . Much of the freshness is gone , washed away by criticism , defeats , frustration and the cacophony of demands aimed at him . <P> But although the presidency ages any man , Jimmy Carter is an unusually resilient one , and some of his characteristics are unchangeable . The smile that punctuates even his gloomiest sentences continues to brighten his face and crinkle the corners of his eyes . The tone of sincerity is unchanged , even when he is greatly overstating his case , and so is the refusal to suffuse his speeches with emotion . Little real joy escapes him , except in his few moments of greatest exhilaration , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> At 54 , Carter is precisely halfway through his first term as President of the United States , a job he sought almost obsessively , began with a poorly directed enthusiasm and now fulfills with somewhat erratic results . He has performed diligently , but with limited success .

He has reversed a major decline in his popularity , yet he is still something of a stranger in his own party , attacked from its broad ideological wings left and right . <P> As Carter faced Congress last week for his State of the Union address , he confronted one of the most serious political problems of his presidency : his inability to lay claim to the unshakable support of any single constituency . Even though the legislative branch is filled with members of his own party , they received his speech with almost as little enthusiasm as they showed the pariah Richard Nixon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In failing to achieve real leadership of the nation , Carter has so far proved unable to break post-Viet Nam , post-Watergate mood of bitterness and distrust that , in part , brought him to office . He is treated with less respect by the public , the Congress and the press than would be expected of a man of his record and rather benign personality . All this has produced a sense of regret in the President himself . " The duty of our generation of Americans , " he noted last week , " is to renew our nation 's faith-not focused just against foreign threats , but against the threat of selfishness , cynicism and apathy .
