txt With each speech by one of President Carter 's in- i flat:on fighters , it becomes increasingly clear that the Administration 's campaign for voluntary price-wage restraint is to be a blend of persuasion and threat , but without sanctions . The language is becoming increasingly tough , almost pugnacious . The news media are paying attention to such talk because it is still comparatively new . The question for which the Administration seems to have no answer is this : When the tough talk becomes familiar and no longer makes headlines , what will the Administration do to preserve its image of vigilance and to maintain the pressure Of public opinion  --  such as it may be  --  on the people who make wage and price decisions ? Further , what will Mr. Carter and his associates do about visible violations of the " deceleration " principle ? That principle asserts that this year 's increases in prices and wages should be , generally , at least a half percentage point below average increases in 1976-77 . As labor leaders and captains of industry know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil prices and has no power whatsoever to control compensation . Mindful that even the slightest hint of an inclination to seek and use such powers would trigger anticipatory price and wage rises , Mr. Carter and his lieutenants repeatedly disavow any thought of controls . What , then , can they do ? They can talk , in private to industry and labor , in public to the American people . Making this strategy sound as effective as possible , Robert S. Strauss , the President 's counselor for inflation , described it today as " hard jawboning . " As outlined by Mr. Strauss and by Barry P. Bosworth , director of the Council on Wage and Price Stability , it will be a strategy that combines attempts at moral suasion with threats . Mr. Strauss took the lofty approach in a speech last // Analysis // week in New York . " We must all join in and help each other , " he said . In that vein , Mr. Carter sought to set an example for the country last month . In an April 11 speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President said that he would hold the pay rise for Federal civil servants next autumn to 51/4 ** said that was half a , point below what was likely ' to be indicated by a study of wages in Ithe private economy . The Administration has told the incensed leaders of Federal employee unions that their members would suffer no loss because they would be helping by their example to slow the rate of inflation . Yet , Charles L. Schultze , chairman of the Council of . Economic Advisers , acknowledged at the National Press Club today that inflation in 1978 would add up to 63% to 7 percent , up three-fourths of a percentage point from the January forecast . Plainly , this is bad news for an Administration that asks labor to take less . " The threat of an acceleration of inflation can not be lightly dismissed , " Mr. Schultze said , an apparent reference to the upward . spiral that can result as high : er readings of the Consumer Price Index trigger ? wage escalators , sending up employment costs and putting new pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration is pressing its campaign . Mindful that- inflation is very much a matter of expectations , Mr. Bosworth is combining his appeals and tough talk with suggestions that the tide already has begun to turn . The council 's staff has taken a measure of credit for helping the Administration to talk down last month 's Increase in steel prices . Mr. Strauss said the 1.4 percent price rise announced by the General Motors Corporation on Friday showed compliance with the deceleration principle . " In the past months , we have had a number of meetings with industrial and union leaders to explain precisely what we are seeking , " Mr. Bosworth said yesterday in a speech in Atlanta to the American Newspaper Publishers ' Association . " We are getting signals that there is a strong desire to help . " Pugnacity and Symbolism Then , in what was intended as a hardhitting climax , Mr. Bosworth combined pugnacity and symbolism , as follows : " Certainly , in the next few months we anticipate resistance from both business and labor in specific situations . Our policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are told  --  and we will be  --  that there is just no way to achieve that obiective , we will demand to know why . We have subpoena power and we can look at books . And we think our accounting techniques are pretty good . " When we think either prices or wages are out of line with the objective , we will speak out publicly . We will use our power to hold public hearings and , where appropriate , the Government will realign its purchases to avoid those items whose prices are rising rapidly . " As council insiders have admitted in the past , its subpoena power is less than meets the eye . The power was written into law to empower the council to pry cost and profit data from reluctant companies . But any company that is genuinely unwilling to submit such data can fight a subpoena in the courts for a year or two , meanwhile putting into effect the price rises the council would inhibit . For this reason , the council has sought to persuade rather than compel companies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both when companies requested them as a . protection against possible stockholder charges of disclosure of confidential data . The two companies then readily submitted the data sought . In short , the subpoena threat has little credibility . " It 's a club in the closet , one we prefer not to use , " an Administration official said . As for accounting , the council has no accountant on its staff . " Our economists are pretty good at accounting , " a council spokesman argued . 20 Economists Now Employed The council also has fewer economists than Mr. Schultze and the budget office determined more than a year ago that it should have . After taking office and making an appraisal , the Carter Administration asked Congress to let the council add 10 economists to the 20 now employed , a figure that includes Mr. Bosworth . Some months later , that request was withdrawn as part of a reorganization of the executive branch . Mr. Carter 's need to be seen trimming the bureaucracy was deemed to be an overriding consideration . The council was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that insiders regard as less than satisfactory . The council 's ' appropriation for 1978 was $1,795,000 . The request to Congress . for 1979 is $1,753,000 . Mr. Bosworth plans to meet with doctors , hospital administrators and Blue Cross-Blue Shield executives to talk about retarding the rapidly rising cost of health care . To the extent that this is an industry in which the price-setter meets the consumer face to face , arousing public opinion may prove to be more effective than it would be , say , in aluminum , another industry being jawboned . With the winter rise in farm prices expected to level off or even turn around , relieving pressure on retail food prices , it is just possible that the recent acceleration of inflation will abate within a few months . That would give the Administration an opportunity to assert that the tide had turned , and that jawboning had helped .
