The front page of the East Hampton Summer Sun and five sister weeklies published for the well-heeled vacationers who flock to the east end of Long Island was given over in its entirety recently to a letter from the police chief of nearby Bridgehampton . The lawman asked that residents contribute raw meat to local authorities to help feed a killer shark roaming the area 's beaches so that its consumption of swimmers could be cut back from one or two a day . <P> The papers forthwith received telephone calls from the Wall Street Journal , the Christian Science Monitor , SPORTS ILLUSTRATED and other publications . If the inquisitors had been familiar with the weeklies , they would have known that the letter , like much else that appears in the papers , was a fake . The missive was the handiwork of Dan Rattiner , 35 , who publishes the six summer papers and two others ( a total of 64,000 giveaway copies a week ) and has a good time doing it . <P> Eye-Opener . From sharks Rattiner has since switched to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,293,760 in East Hampton parking fines . Among other Rattiner whoppers : a 1972 disclosure that Billionaire Howard Hughes had moved into the top two floors of the area 's tallest ( seven stories ) building , and an eye-opener last year about how Soviet oil drillers were operating off Hither Hills State Park with an oil rig disguised as a fishing trawler . Both the stories sent reporters from national news organizations scrambling to investigate . " I believe the line between reality and fiction is obvious , " says Rattiner . " If I fail in making it so , it is my fault . But it certainly gets everyone talking about the paper . " <P> Rattiner broke into creative journalism at age 20 after his father fired him from a summer job at the family drugstore in Long Island 's easternmost village , Montauk . His offense : serving seven-scoop sundaes . He quickly raised $3,100 from local merchants and launched the Montauk Pioneer , his first free-distribution summer weekly . Today Rattiner owns a local printing firm , an advertising agency , a messenger and delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he runs from his three-story gray-shingled " Dan 's Papers Publishing Tower " on Main Street , Bridgehampton . <P> Rattiner lives contentedly . The papers gross $300,000 a year from advertising , netting the editor-publisher about $32,000-enough for him , his wife and two children to vacation three months each winter in Provence , Maui , or some similarly exotic spot , where he concocts the coming summer 's hoaxes . Rattiner turns out fully 80% of his papers ' copy ( three reporters handle the rest ) , and not all of it is tomfoolery . The weeklies are heavy on local history and guides to entertainment and shopping . <P> Dan 's Papers rarely stray into the crabby waters of hard news , but for years Rattiner has been campaigning to save the 1795 Montauk Lighthouse from demolition . The lighthouse was finally designated an official landmark , and this month a citizens ' group presented a proud Rattiner with a plaque inscribed IN APPRECIATION . Notes Rattiner wryly : " For what , it does n't say . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
