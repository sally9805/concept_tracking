 | How to Do Battle With Grownups As A child , whenever I asked my father why I had to sit up straight , brush my hair or hold my fork correctly , his usual answer was , " Because I said so . " It never seemed to me a good enough reason . On the other hand , I was never able to think of a good retort , either , and I invariably ended up crossly brushing my hair or holding my fork right . I realize now that my father was taking advantage of my inexperience . In the unending battle between children and adults , the grownups win most of the time , not because they are smarter or morally superior , but because they were kids once themselves and know all of the enemy 's secrets . To redress the balance , I would like to offer some advice to the children . A grownup , Mr. Goliath , may fire the opening shot : " David , please do n't make that noise when you 're eating . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that slurping noise . " " I ca n't help it . The soup 's hot . " " Wait till it cools . " " But you 're always saying eat your dinner before it gets cold . " " Stop arguing . " Mr. Goliath is be-128  | Goliath announces , " Eight o'clock , honey . Time for bed . " She has sugar-coated her voice as if she were offering David a ride in a helicopter or a second Christmas . David should not be fooled . Grownups frequently tell children they want them to go to bed because it is good for their health and will eventually make them successful in business . The truth is : either ( a ) they want the television to themselves , or ( b ) they want the children out of the way so they can stop pretending they are responsible and wise . Resisting the impulse to argue , David says , " Okay , Mommy . " Startled but pleased by this response , Mrs. Goliath lapses back into her magazine , and it is fully ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck around the rug . " I thought I told you it was bedtime . " " I am going , " David says . " I told you . " " It does n't look to me like you 're going , " Mrs. Goliath says . " It looks to me like you 're playing with your truck . " " I just have to finish this . " Mrs. Goliath is somewhat put off , since she can not figure out exactly what it is that David has to finish . So she says , " All right , but do n't take too long . " It will be not quite ten minutes more before she says , " Okay , that 's enough . " " I 'm not finished . " " I do n't care . That 's enough . Now ginning to show signs of strain . " Just eat your soup without making that noise . It 's rude . " " Why is it rude ? " " Because I said so ! " Mr. Goliath bangs out the classic line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David must do is pull back as if retreating , and then , when he has drawn his opponent onto new ground , attack again . He may now say , " Is it okay if I do it quietly ? " This mollifies Goliath , gulling him into a false sense that he has won the battle . After all , his whole point was to make David eat more quietly . So he says , " Okay . " David now continues to slurp as before . Lulled by his seeming victory , Mr. Goliath does n't realize for several minutes that he has accomplished nothing . Finally , he snaps , " I told you to stop slurping . " " I 'm trying . " " Well , try harder . " " I am trying harder . " Mr. Goliath struggles to keep his temper . " Dammit , when I say something , I want you to do it ! " Whereupon , his soup finished , David says , " Okay , I wo n't do it anymore . " The point is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the appearance of retreating before superior power , when in fact he is actually shifting sideways . Consider the following : It is about 8 p.m. , and David has been playing quietly with a truck on the living-room rug . Suddenly , Mrs.  | hop into your pajamas . " She is beginning to lose her temper . Now David sets the trap . " You said I could finish . " Mrs. Goliath pauses a moment to get a grip on her temper . " Finish what ? " she says . The trap is sprung . With a little imagination , David can expend as long as half an hour explaining the nature of the game , with demonstrations and elaborate elucidation of the rules , which he makes up as he goes along . Operating carefully , David may get to 8:45 before Mrs. Goliath snaps an order to brush his teeth . Whereupon David can counter with , " How about a bath ? " This is a request no parent can refuse . And , simply by dawdling , David can stretch it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , he ends up in bed eventually ; but , by the rules of domestic warfare , any time a child is still up one hour after first being told to go to bed , he can claim victory . It should be remembered , however , that the Goliaths , having been children themselves , are cunning and sometimes use subtle tactics . Let us suppose that Mrs. Goliath has come home from the self-service laundry Saturday noon with some absolutely choice gossip about Jack and Mary Finsterwald . The news is trembling at her lips , but there in the living room with Mr. Goliath sits David , contentedly shading in the white spaces in the weekend crossword puzzle . She gives Mr. Goliath a wink and a jerk of the head , indicating that he should follow her into the kitchen . Then , just as she is about to unburden herself of her news , her eyes shining , David trails in , saying , " What 's for lunch ? " At this point Mrs. Goliath can hardly say , " Go away , David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want you to hear . " Instead , she says , " Have you finished cleaning your room ? " " Yes , " he says . " I did it yesterday . " This may well be an untruth , but Mrs. Goliath does n't want to get into a long wrangle about David 's room . So she tries again . " What about your science report ? " " I do n't have to do that until Wednesday . What 's for lunch ? " By this time , David has got the message . Clearly , he is going to miss out on something if he leaves , so he drifts over to the kitchen table and begins playing with the salt and pepper shakers . Recognizing this lingering ploy , Mrs. Goliath says , " Darling , your father and I have something important to talk over . " Now David has n't been darling since about four days after he was born , and he knows it . He also knows that the moment somebody calls him that , watch out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll just sit here and be quiet . " By this time , Mr. Goliath decides to get into the act . " This is grownup talk , David , " he says , his voice all growly and serious . And this is where David , in his inexperience , can make a mistake . If the Goliaths are reasonably good ac- tors , they may actually convince David that something quite serious is afoot . Mr. Goliath has lost his job again , or Uncle Fritz has blown a gasket and will have to be sent back to the Home for repairs . David may then go away , quietly sucking his thumb . He should remember this important rule , however : when anything really awful has happened , the grownups will always pretend that nothing is the matter . It follows , thus , that when they come on all growly and serious , ten to one a con is going on . Therefore he asks , " What 's grownup about it ? " This question is terribly difficult to answer , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to tense up , and Mr. Goliath 's voice is getting very loud , so David exercises the better part of valor and flees . He does so , however , smug in the knowledge that whatever it was they were going to talk about has been forgotten . But the fact remains that , from time to time , the Goliaths pass out a ruling which has real substance behind it . Such as : " If you keep playing with that glass like that , you 're going to break it . " David has known all along that the chances of his breaking the glassare good . However , ( a ) it might not happen right away ; ( b ) there are plenty of glasses in the kitchen cabinet ; and ( c ) it is too much fun to stop . He says , " I wo n't break it . " " Yes , you will , " says Mr. Goliath . " Now stop playing with it . " " I 'll be careful . " At this point , the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now he stands naked before his enemies . Already a shriek of triumph is forming on their lips . David has only one recourse left . Bursting into tears , he runs out of the house , shouting , " Everybody hates me ! " This is a palpable untruth , but it is going to worry the Goliaths , at least temporarily . Have they been too hard on the youngster ? Did something happen at school that is upsetting him ? By the time David returns , they will not only have resolved to say no more about the incident but will have picked up the broken glass . It is , admittedly , a desperate measure . But in the war between grownups and children , the rule is : No quarter given ? and the sooner David learns this , the better . In fact , he 'd do well to take notes . Someday he might have little ones of his own . @#
