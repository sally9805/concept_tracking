 | square in Milan . Was the dream a premonition ? Nobody lives forever . Still , he had the stubborn Spaniard 's ability to survive . Even Hitler had sensed that , ranting and threatening , in the dream and at their meeting in Hendaye across the French frontier , after France had fallen . They met not in the Fiihrer 's railroad car , as the official reports of the meeting had it , but at the Hotel Irritzina , in a small conference room , the best the hotel had to offer , with their interpreters hovering near like the confidential banderilleros of two bullfighters dickering over which bulls should be paired . " I ca n't take Gibraltar from the sea , " Hitler had said . No answer necessary . No one could take Gibraltar from the sea , not while the red ensign of the Royal Navy sailed the Mediterranean . " You have roads . You have rails , General . " General , not Generalissimo . " You owe me this . I won your war for you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilots . Spain won its own war . " Luncheon had ended . In the dream he remembered the meal . A Basque omelette , some vegetables , orange juice . No meat , no wine . A plate of sweets that Hitler had gobbled in bursts of nervous frustration , crumbs sprinkling his jacket . The Fi.ihrer had strange tastes , and no manners . He got up and paced back and forth with that odd twitchy walk of his , in jackboots and dark brown whipcord decorated with the predictable hooked cross . " Napoleon , " the Spaniard droned in his shrill monotone , " wanted to take Portugal from behind . Now you want to take Gibraltar from behind . Napoleon stayed a long time in Spain . " " You will open the frontier , " Hitler screamed , in Hendaye and in the dream . A stretch , an elaborate yawn , while the Fiihrer 's dark eyes  | studied him and then darted this way and that , as if seeking a way out . I le looked up at those eyes and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Herr Hitler . My siesta . " " Your what ? " " A simple Spanish custom . Sensible . We Spaniards are a simple people . " Later , the Fuhrer would tell an aide he would rather have all his teeth yanked than meet , again with that simple Spaniard . A small bow , and then the doors had opened and the Generalissimo went upstairs to his suite . He stayed there two hours . He did not sleep . He did not even undress . He kept Hitler waiting . When he came down , Hitler said : " I could open the frontier myself . " " What 's the hurry ? In a hundred years we 'll all be bald . " " I could keep you here in occupied France , " Hitler threatened in a harsh whisper . " What would happen to your government then ? " The Generalissimo said nothing . Hitler ranted for nine hours . The destiny of the German people . The corruption of the British . The decadence of the French . He offered to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generalissimo said : " I have to go back . We 'll talk about it another time . " The Fuhrer had other business , and the Generalissimo knew it . A few weeks later Nazi Germany invaded Russia . A few years later Russia repaid the visit , and Hitler shot Eva Braun and took cyanide in the Fiihrerbunker . The Generalissimo shaved carefully with his left hand . His jaw sagged open . He tried to clamp it shut . It remained slack . His right hand quivered while he dressed . No uniform . A dou-  | ble-breasted suit and a Basque beret clapped over his head . Lately , the Basque beret had created a stir . The Basque separatists had speculated about it . The cabinet would speculate this morning , when he removed the beret and set it to one side on the green baize of the long table . He wore the beret because his head felt the cold . In a hundred years we 'll all be bald . He looked at his watch . He would keep them waiting half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second floor of the Pardo Palace , nine miles northeast of Madrid . The drapes were drawn , his wife still sleeping . He did not disturb her . He stood at the window and parted the drapes long enough to see that three black Mercedes limousines were already parked outside , their chauffeurs smoking , shivering in the cold . Frost sparkled on the ground . Winter had come early this year to Europe 's highest capital . The first blow struck him from behind , at the base of the skull . He staggered and clutched the windowsill . Later , weeks later when he began to remember things , he would recall whirling , as if to defend himself against an attacker . There was nobody . The blow to the back of his head , what had seemed a blow , had receded to a dull ache . He looked at Carmen 's face , serene in sleep , serene in the One True Faith which he tried to share but did not really share , and shrugged . Another headache . Another one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . He knew he would not see Dr. Caballero . What had Caballero been able to do for his palsied hand , his sagging mouth ? Like most Spaniards , he felt ill at ease with doctors . Or lawyers . Or scientists . They knew more about a thing than you did . You could n't argue with them . What was the sense of consulting someone you could n't argue with ? The second blow struck him in the same place , at the base of the skull , as he sat at the head of the conference table and  | listened to the Foreign Minister 's arguments for taking Gibraltar . Hitler thirty years ago and in the dream , and now his own Foreign Minister . Everybody wanted to take Gibraltar . He wanted to cry out against the terrible pain , but grasped his right hand in his left and made no sound . " Well then , " the Foreign Minister was saying , " we can carve a new province , part of Cadiz , part of Huelva , and call it Gibraltar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean ? " Admiral Rojas Millan , the President and day-to-day ruler under the eighty-year-old Generalissimo , nodded approvingly , puffy jowls quivering . Reactionary old goat , as good for Spain as a cold Andalucian winter that would chase all the tourists away and destroy the citrus crops . The Admiral would bear watching , he thought , and that was when the third blow struck , and the fourth . He half rose from his chair . He was all pain then , and a reeling , sinking , everything-going-away feeling . The chair overturned as he fell sideways , heavily , to the floor , like a bull after a perfect sword thrust . Francisco Franco had just suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage . The bullfighter sat in a cafe on Calle Larios in Malaga , nursing his fourth Carlos Primero and his fourth cup of what Spaniards call cafe solo , coffee alone , black as tar , bitter as wormwood , but warming . It was the hour before dawn and , three hundred miles north , in the Pardo Palace outside Madrid , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Heavy in the breast pocket of the bullfighter 's jacket was a puntillo , a broad short dagger , the kind used in the bullring to sever the bull 's spine when the bull refuses to let the sword or , after the failure of the sword , the descabello , to kill him . The cafe should have closed hours ago . The corrugated metal shutter was down , the sweeper had swept the floor three times , the one remaining waiter leaned against the bar , head down on his folded arms . The sweeper was an old man , and wished only for bed . The waiter was younger , and thought about the warmth of his woman 's body . Neither one would ask the bullfighter to leave . They admired the bullfighter , and loved him and hated him , and they would remain as long as he did . The bullfighter thought of death . He had killed three thousand bulls in twenty years , for the love and the hatred of men like the sweeper and the waiter . He would kill no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last two bulls of his life . In half an hour he will kill a man . He will execute a man the way a stubborn bull is executed in the plaza de toros , with the broad-bladed puntillo . A bull is hide and muscle and bone . A man is skin and muscle and bone . A bull has no soul , but sometimes he has heart , much heart . Perhaps men have souls . This man he will kill has no soul . He has a gray-green uniform and a machine pistol slung over his shoulder and a shiny black patent leather hat . Or maybe he does have a soul . A patent leather soul . The bullfighter got up . " Good night , " he told the waiter . The waiter had seen him here in the pre-dawn hours before , afflicted with sleeplessness . The waiter would not connect him with the death of the patent leather soul . " Good morning , maestro , " the waiter corrected him , almost smiling .  | The bullfighter waited while the shutter was partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was raining . He could smell the sea in the wind-whipped rain . He could feel the weight of the puntillo . Civil Guards walk in pairs for protection . They rule rural Spain and the provincial cities . A virgin could walk in the middle of the night in safety from one end of Malaga to the other , thanks to the Civil Guards . Sometimes they are overzealous . Sometimes the marching in pairs with slung machine pistols is not enough . Sometimes they kill people . He has a woman , the telephone said . He has a woman , matador . Matador : killer . Of bulls , and soon of a man . He has a woman in an apartment on the second alley to the left off Calle Granada after you leave the plaza . He is there most nights , after work . He comes alone . He leaves alone . Not in uniform . Would you recognize him ? Oh , I would recognize him , the bullfighter told himself . I would most certainly recognize him . I would recognize him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hell . The voice on the telephone was no voice he recognized . He went , at first , just to see , a rehearsal of an act he would never commit . The patent leather soul came out of that alley , all right . He went , and went again . Every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday , at dawn , out of the house on the alley off Calle Granada came the patent leather soul . He never varied the pattern . He fucked by the clock and the calendar . The bullfighter walked quickly along Larios , away from the sea , jacket collar up against the rain . The street was deserted . The rain hit hard and bounced . He walked faster , reached the broad plaza at the head of Larios , and entered the narrow Calle Granada . Second callejon , second alley on the left . He stepped into a doorway and waited , the puntillo in his hand .  | If anyone sees me , then it is over . It is finished and done with . The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one would see him . He had rehearsed this killing six times already . No one else passed at that hour . Maybe the Civil Guard would wait out the rain in the woman 's apartment , he thought suddenly . He did not like the thought . Then he heard footsteps . He saw the Civil Guard coming out of the alley , through the silver rain under a streetlight and then closer , a darkness silhouetted against the silver , whistling a paso doble . A bull dies , well-killed , and the bullfighter circles the ring , a grin on his face , holding high the bloody ear . This was not the same . Then he saw a face , what was left of a face after three machine pistol slugs have stitched across it , low to the left of the jaw , beside the nose , high on the right side of the forehead . He took two steps out of the doorway as the Civil Guard walked past , whistling . A matador does not use the puntillo for killing . A matador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossbar back of the point , the descabello . A bullring lackey uses the puntillo , one quick thrust behind the great head of the fallen but not yet dead bull to sever the spinal cord . A deft , artful dispatcher of moribund bulls , dressed in white . " Look , you , " the bullfighter said softly . " You know who I am ? " Faintly the bullfighter could see a widening of the eyes in the broad face . " It was a mistake , matador , " said the Civil Guard . " Yes , of course . A mistake . " The Civil Guard looked to right and left , and behind . He crouched , and a hand darted for the pocket of the raincoat .  | You stand watching , using the red serge killing cape to guide the bull , until the forehooves are planted just so in the sand of the arena . Then you go in over the horns , giving the bull a chance to kill you as you kill the bull . It is called the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged with a revolver , and the bullfighter heard a click as the empty chamber rotated clear of the firing pin . Then he caught the arm and twisted it , spinning the man and pulling the arm up between his shoulder blades . The Civil Guard gasped and hunched over , head down , back of neck exposed . When the spine can be severed , half a ton of fighting bull dies like turning off a light . For an instant he could not do it . He saw the face again , stitched with bullets . He put the dagger in , at the back of the neck , and there was a convulsive jerk and the revolver clattered on the pavement as he dropped the dead man . A blinding light flashed in his face . A voice , the voice of the telephone , said : " Now , matador . Now we will talk . " 9  | As all good killings should , this one at first looked as if it had been rehearsed . The boy had wisely led the three-year-old bull into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved out of the face of the cliff to reduce the effect the Poniente , the west wind blowing in from the Mediterranean , would have on his red serge killing cape . He cited the bull from a distance , calling him with a gutteral " huh-huh , toro . " The bull raised his massive head as the boy moved his left wrist to open the cape , and then came at a rushing gallop , tail up , tossing muscle crested with rage , horn tips ivory white under the deep blue sky of a May afternoon in Andalucia . The boy passed him twice , testing passes , and the bull followed the lure obediently.  | Then the boy , wearing not a suit of lights but the traje corto , the short dark gray jacket and trousers of the south , fixed the bull in place , studying the position of the forehooves before lowering the killing cape to see that the bull obeyed . The bull did , head going down , eyes fixed on red serge , and the boy rose on his toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downward-tipped sword an extension of the arm ; and then , despite the rehearsal quality of the killing , he spoiled it all by moving too fast , crossing the cape with his left hand almost as an afterthought , driving forward hard , three quick strides and the sword went in at the killing place behind the bull 's great skull , disappearing to the hilt as the horns lifted , searching , and the boy hung over them an instant before he cleared them to his own left and the bull bellowed and shuddered and fell dead . Ricardo Diaz looked at his son , standing over the fallen bull , a smile on his handsome face , somehow not the right kind of smile , a cynical smile , and the boy was all of eighteen years old . Maybe he had enjoyed Paris too much , Ricardo Diaz thought , maybe Paris had been a mistake . Still , not two hours off the Iberia jet in Malaga , it seemed incredible that the boy could remember the training he had received years ago , could perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right . But an athlete and a bullfighter are not the same thing , and Ricardo Diaz could see that on the faces of the matadors who had come to watch his son perform , despite their words of praise as one after another they slipped through the opening in the dark red wooden fence to congratulate Jose Carlos . Miguel Marquez and Palomo Linares , both in their prime and fighting seventy and eighty times a year now , were if anything too lavish with their praise . They would soon fight in the same rings with Jose Carlos Diaz , son of that Ricardo Diaz who , four years ago at San Isidro in Madrid , where ears are awarded grudgingly , had not once but twice during the festival been awarded two ears for his work . It had never happened  | before and likely never would happen again , and Diaz had shocked the bullfighting world by cutting the pigtail at the end of the season . Thirty-six then and , everyone said , the best , the most complete matador since Manolete or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrained . Old Antonio Buenavista , thrice retired , balding , built like a tree trunk with a belly , patted the boy 's shoulder and turned away to stare down through the umbrella pines and cork trees and across the road to the Mediterranean . The other Antonio , Antonio Ordonez , said a few words to the boy that Diaz did not hear . Ordonez was not smiling . Diego Puerta , whose three-year-old bull had been killed for the occasion , solemnly shook Jose Carlos ' hand and turned to make a circle of his thumb and forefinger as Ricardo Diaz came through the opening in the fence . Manuel Benitez , El Cordobes , grinned his magnet of a grin , but that was El Cordobes ' style . It would be hard to stop him grinning at a funeral . Buenavista , Ordonez , Puerta and El Cordobes would never have to enter a ring with Jose Carlos . " He 's much athlete , " said Antonio Buenavista in his deep voice , and Ricardo Diaz accepted the statement as a diplomatic reservation of judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jose Carlos said . Eighteen years old , and too damned much like his father in some ways . And not enough in others . The drive back from Malaga International Airport had not been pleasant . Diaz had parked the Ferrari in an area reserved for buses . An attendant came over at a quick limping trot , shaking his head until he recognized the great matador , and  | then of course everything was fine . The limping attendant all but snapped to attention and saluted . Ricardo Diaz was the second most famous man in Spain , and he had known when to quit . The most famous man in Spain , if you could read between the lines of ABC or Vanguardia , was dying without dignity in Madrid , because he had not known when to quit . Never mind politics , Ricardo Diaz thought . Leave that to Maria Teresa . Leave that to La Quijota , exiled in Paris and , probably , these past two months , putting ideas into Jose Carlos ' head . Through the crowd of tourists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray-clad customs agents and green-uniformed Civil Guards with their patent leather hats and slung machine pistols , his sharp eyes caught sight of Jose Carlos , young and blond as his American mother had been blond , waiting at the slowly rotating luggage conveyor . " How was Paris ? " " I left it more or less the way I found it , " said Jose Carlos as he lifted his leather bag from the conveyor . They went outside together , father and son , both tall for Spaniards , the younger one fair of skin and hair and looking like a quarterback for the Texas Longhorns , the older one dark and not showing his forty years and looking like a bullfighter . One blue-eyed , the other with yellow-flecked dark brown eyes , one with an open , ingenuous American face , the other dignified but not dour , muy espaiiol , very Spanish . " Still got the old bus , I see , " Jose Carlos said as his father opened the Ferrari 's trunk . " It 's got good blood lines , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stud bull out of it , one of these days . " They were speaking English , as they usually did together , as if in homage to the blond beauty from Dallas who had drunk  | herself to death because her husband had to fight the bulls . That , among other reasons . They followed the traffic past the garish billboards that told you how to spend your dollars and pounds and Deutschmarks and guilders in Torremolinos and Marbella . " Expected you yesterday , " Ricardo Diaz said . " You got my telegram , did n't you ? " " A lot of busy people are waiting to see what you can do . " " Let them wait . " Diaz made a right turn on the Carretera de Cadiz , four lanes of new highway that had the added advantage of bypassing the aberration that was Torremolinos , although even from the bypass they caught glimpses of the forest of high-rise hotels and apartment complexes . Traffic thinned out , and Diaz opened up the Ferrari . A BMW with German plates moved into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . The speedometer needle hit a hundred and fifty and stayed there . After a while Jose Carlos said : " I was thinking of going back to school . " " Where ? The States ? " " No . Madrid . " Ricardo Diaz shut his eyes and then opened them . He saw the face with the three bullets stitched across it . The needle quivered up toward one hundred seventy kilometers an hour . " I gather you saw Maria Teresa in Paris . " " Sure . What 's wrong with that ? " " Nothing . But it would make more sense in the States . Harvard . Yale . " " I guess way down deep I 'm a Spic , " said Jose Carlos . " Cut that out , " Ricardo Diaz said . " They shut the university twice already this year . That 's no way to get an education . " Lying on the ground at University City in Madrid , dead , 15  | your face smashed by three slugs from a machine pistol , was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , go to the States . You want to fight the bulls , stay here . " " Oh , I 'll fight the bulls . This season . I promised . " " What did you promise Maria Teresa ? " " Look , Dad . I 'm not Al . Al was a different kind of guy . " " What did you promise her ? " " She did most of the talking . " Jose Carlos flashed his quick smile . " She always does . She 's coming back , she says . " " They 'll throw her in jail . " Jose Carlos laughed . " First they 'll have to find her . " " They 'll find her . They 'll put her in the cell next to yours . " " Mine ? I 'm just an apprentice bullfighter about to take his alternativa . Jose Carlos Diaz , El Americano . On all the pretty posters . " " Tell your Quijota she can shove her politics up her ass . Tell her I said so . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bypass to the coast road . He glanced left at the beaches and green shoal waters and the deep blue at the knife-edged horizon . He could see Maria Teresa , with a backpack , descending on Spain from the Pyrenees , the Civil Guards baying at her heels . She 'd probably enjoy it . As she 'd enjoy turning boys like Jose Carlos into political activists . She 'd done a pretty good job on his brother . Unless Jose Carlos learned that , after all , the bulls were in his blood . He 'd better learn it in a hurry , Ricardo Diaz thought as they drove up the unpaved road past bark-stripped , ochrepainted cork trees to Rancho Andaluz . Half a kilometer off the highway , the ranch was a showplace , a low , rambling , whitewashed brick building , hotel-big and usually off-season-hotel-empty , halfway between Puerto Real  | and Marbella . Tourists would point it out to one another : " That 's Ricardo Diaz 's place . You know , the great matador ? " The great matador , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a businessman . Bulls of Navarra crossed with the bigger bulls of Andalucia , and the new strain had inherited the worst traits of each . Even his friends would n't tight them . He had sold them for beef . After that came the import-export business , in which a man in Peru made a lot of money while Ricardo Diaz lost a lot of money . Then came the avocado trees , acres of them planted mature at enormous expense . Half of them had died , victim of a blight with a long Latin name . The remaining trees had yielded avocados with flesh as fibrous as sugar cane . The cork trees provided some income , but not much . Spain , like the rest of the world , was going plastic . The ranch looked pretty good from the road . It looked pretty good from the bullring blasted out of the side of the hill . You could n't see the crumbling , abandoned outbuildings . It was only a hobby , Ricardo Diaz 's jet-set friends told one another . Good old Rick 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty thousand bucks a fight . Good old Rick was going urbanely into debt . Like a poor hidalgo he hid the fact well . He still had the twin-engined Cessna at the Aero Club in Malaga , and the Dutch-built , teakdecked , twenty-meter motor sailer berthed at the yacht basin in Nueva Andalucia . He had the Ferrari , no longer new but maintained impeccably , and a staff of twenty at the ranch , and he would fly anywhere , any time , when Ari and Jackie or Richard and Elizabeth or anyone else suggested it . They suggested it on the average of twice a month . He had the good life , all right . After his son had killed the bull , Ricardo Diaz led his guests into the patio between the wings of the ranch house . Bougain-  | villea fell in purple cascades over the whitewashed brick walls . The servants , still wearing the straw and white colors of the ranch that no longer bred bulls , served Taittinger champagne and lobster and serrano ham and charcoal-grilled skewers of beef heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove they were good Spaniards . Before he saw the car , Ricardo Diaz heard the rattle of its short-stroke engine as it turned off the highway and up the steep unpaved road to the ranch . Then he saw it briefly through the grove of cork trees , an ancient battered Seiscientos dragging its cloud of dust past one wing of the ranch house to the kitchen door . In a little while one of the daughters of the ranch foreman appeared on the patio . " The left hand , " Antonio Buenavista was saying . " Teach Jose Carlos to use the left hand , and you 'll have something . " The girl said : " A man , Don Ricardo . Something about a lottery ticket ? " Ricardo Diaz reached automatically for a cigarette and reminded himself he had given up smoking . Six months had passed since that night in Malaga . They had not contacted him . He had waited with the tension a few weeks and then had put it out of his mind . He had trained himself , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Past and future have little meaning for a man who faces death four and five times a week during the long hot temporada , the season of killing . He felt his face stiffen , the same drawing tight of the flesh over the cheekbones and around the mouth he 'd experienced in the old days just as the toril gate opened and the bull came exploding out , the only sign of a fear he had almost learned to control . El Cordobes laughed . " Maybe you won the fat one , " he said . " The gordo can keep you in champagne for ? " Diaz cut him short with a gesture , not quite rude , and said : " Excuse me . This wo n't take long . "  | The man was old . He wore a gray jacket with a black mourning band on the left sleeve , and a small black beret . He doffed the beret . " Sr. Diaz ? " he said . " But yes , forgive me , maestro , the whole world knows Ricardo Diaz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . Ricardo Diaz had seen that face before , a hundred times , in bullrings from San Sebastian to Valencia , the face of a Spanish peasant , timeworn , sun- and wind-scorched , shy but somehow proud . " What 's this about a lottery ticket ? " " That is what they said , maestro , in Torremolinos . To tell you it was a thing of a lottery ticket . And to give you this . " The old man 's gnarled hand produced a white envelope . The sad , gentle eyes crinkled . " It is a very rare place now , Torremolinos , is it not ? " Ricardo Diaz agreed that Torremolinos was a very rare place . He took the envelope . The old man 's rope-soled shoes scuffed the tile floor in the hallway . " Who gave you this , viejo ? " The gentle eyes looked away . " I run errands , " the old man said . He cleared his throat and then gazed steadily at Ricardo Diaz . " It is wished that you sign for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered paper , and a ballpoint pen , and leaned over a low walnut table to sign his name . The old man cleared his throat again . Diaz gave him the paper with his signature on it . The old man reached into his pocket and came up with a tattered copy of El Ruedo and opened it to the centerfold , where Ricardo Diaz could be seen in full color , in the Las Ventas bullring in Madrid , holding aloft the two ears of the bull he had just killed . " If I had been there , " the old man sighed . " If I had seen it , the giving of two ears twice , in Madrid . Would you write your  | name again , maestro , for a favor ? Would you write , ' To the retired Civil Guard Pedro Ramirez , who has aficion ' ? " The request was made gravely , and just as gravely Ricardo Diaz autographed the picture . He gave the magazine to the old man , who waited , scuffing his rope-soled shoes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My pen , maestro . " In spite of himself , Ricardo Diaz smiled . He returned the pen . Ramirez offered his hand , and Diaz shook it . " I hope you won in the lottery , " the old man said . Oh , I won . I won , all right , Ricardo Diaz thought as the old man left . I won the gordo . The fat one . He watched the small , battered car leave . He opened the envelope . In it was a glossy photograph of himself . A very good likeness of Ricardo Diaz , killer of bulls , killing a man . The man was falling , having just received the puntillo in the back of his neck , and Diaz was holding the short , broad-bladed dagger at the level his neck would have been an instant before . Diaz turned the photograph over . On the back someone had written a Madrid telephone number . Diaz took a long slow breath , shut the door and pocketed the photograph . He went back through the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon sun almost blinded him , like the flashbulb on Calle Granada in Malaga , six months ago . After the others had gone , after Jose Carlos had taken the Dodge wagon and driven into Torremolinos , Ricardo Diaz had three quick shots of Carlos Primero and went outside to the Ferrari . He did n't want to think , not yet .  | Driving fast on the edge of control would keep him from thinking . A woman would keep him from thinking . Machismo , he told himself wryly . A pointless display of bravery , a pointless gratification of lust . The two keystones of the Spanish male 's character , Maria Teresa had once said with amused contempt , cojones in a driver 's seat and cojones in bed , Juan Fangio and Don Juan , Santiago and up yours was the way she had put it . Maybe Maria Teresa was right . He started driving . Less than twenty minutes later , he pulled into the night-dark driveway of a villa in Benalmadena , the old Moorish town perched a thousand feet above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the Moors . On a good day you could see all the way to Gibraltar and across the Med to the Rif Mountains . Now the owners of the big villas watched each other . Foreigners , mostly , but they had discovered Maria Teresa 's third keystone of the Spanish character , envy . They envied Simon Beriros , a French Algerian Jew who had arrived in Benalmadena flat broke and built himself a real estate empire in that unlikely place after land values in Torremolinos had risen too high . They envied Dale Wassermann , who made a fortune with Man of La Mancha and who , they said , had been lucky and would never have to write again . They envied and lusted after Kate Cameron , that wheat-blond Texas beauty who made Raquel Welch look like a suffragette and who condescended to do a film every year or so , for a million and a half and a percentage of the gross . In her late twenties , Kate Cameron had never married . And of course they whispered lesbian. 21  | Ricardo Diaz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course . That was it . Margarita opened the door for him , her teeth flashing when she recognized him . " Muy Buenas , Margarita , " he said . " Is the senorita home ? " " To you , Don Ricardo ? Always . And if she were n't , she would fly home like a bird . It is not my right , but you should do yourself a favor , Don Ricardo . You should marry her . " Margarita blushed . " I 'll take it under advisement , " Ricardo Diaz said in English . " Don Ricardo ? " " Nothing . Tell her I 'm here . " Tell her I 'm lonely . Tell her I 'm confused . Tell her I do n't kill bulls these days , I kill people . He waited in what Kate Cameron called the museum , fifteen hundred square feet of living room , two stories high , one wall a sweep of glass that looked out over the sea , the other three hung with canvases of Saura , Guerrero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life-size portrait of Kate Cameron , painted by Picasso when Kate had lived on the Cote d'Azur . Not surrealistic at all , and the old man had been in his eighties when he painted it . He called it Demasiado , Too Much , and he had a point . " Hello , Rick , " Kate said . He held her arms lightly and kissed her cheek , turning her head when she began to pull back and brushing her other cheek with his lips . " Both sides , " he said . " Very continental . " Kate laughed . " Teach me , Rick . I 'm a quick study . " She was tall , as tall as he , and as unblatantly sexy as a noble Miura bull is unblatantly brave . She wore a pale blue goldbrocaded Moroccan robe and slippers . The long wheat-blond hair hung to her waist . Her enormous blue eyes looked at him . She was broad-shouldered , even for a girl of her height , but  | somehow not excessively so . She was long-waisted and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Moroccan slippers . Her breasts , pushing against the brocaded silk , were not small , but small for the rest of her . Something subtly wrong in the construction of her , you thought at first glance , as if the bits and pieces had been fashioned for three or four different styles of beauty , but then you looked again and realized she was magnificent . " Only in Texas , " Ricardo Diaz said , and was immediately sorry . She knew his wife had been born a Texan . " Sure , six-gun Kate , the bane of Bad Man 's Gulch . " She smiled nervously . That helped the machismo too , he thought . There was n't another man , anywhere , who would make her nervous . " You 've eaten ? " " Yes . " " Want a drink ? " " No . " " Joey 's back , is n't he ?

" " Not now , Kate . " He caught the sadness in her eyes before she glanced in mock exasperation at the high , shadowed ceiling and said : " He does n't want to eat , he does n't want to drink , or talk , or drive . Let me guess . " 23  | Her bedroom was small , its walls covered with the same gold-brocaded blue as her robe , so that when you entered it , it was like entering her . More brocaded blue for the bedspread , and a single window , wrought-iron barred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cell . She had lighted a candle on the vanity table . He took her very swiftly , Jose Carlos gone , Maria Teresa gone , the old man with his lottery ticket gone , all of them safely away with his face in the wheat-blond hair . He had n't even kissed her . They lay side by side while she smoked a cigarette . " I love you , Rick , " she said . " And I 'm worried about you . You 've been so ? " " Let it go , Kate . I came here to get away from me . " She stubbed out the cigarette . " That 's honest , but it is n't very Spanish . " " Your eyes , " he said quickly in Spanish , using the stylized words of a not very imaginative street-corner flirt , " are bigger than your feet . There 's a hole in heaven , so saints can look down on you and wish they were sinners . Like that ? " " Shut up , Ricardo Diaz . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rib cage . A monster of a Pablo Romero bull had done that , in Bilbao . Her fingertips touched the scar across his waist , welted , seven inches long . A Hermanos Nunez bull with a bad left eye did that , in Salamanca . She touched the other scars , the Miura one under his right arm , the second Miura low on his left thigh , the Don Manuel Benitez , high on the inside of his right thigh , when he had fought El Cordobes ' lousy bulls as a favor , a horn ripping through and almost severing the femoral artery and damn near killing him . Then she was on her knees on the bed and kissing the scars she had touched , one by one . He reached up for her , but she  | pushed against his chest and said , " No , you stay there . Very continental . On both sides . " Later , when she was asleep , he used the phone in her dressing room . He had only been postponing it , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the policia de trafico , the traffic police . They wear dark blue uniforms trimmed with white and white pith helmets . When they stop a motorist to write a ticket , they will first salute smartly and offer an apologetic smile . The platforms from which they direct traffic at busy intersections are , in hot weather , shaded by large colorful beach umbrellas , and when the traffic becomes snarled they will often climb down to head for the nearest cafe and let the motorized anarchists hurl their noisy little cars at one another . They carry sidearms in glossy white leather holsters , the flaps snapped shut so much of the time that many Spaniards say the holsters are stuffed with paper or handkerchiefs , like the athletic supports of certain bullfighters.  | A cut above the traficos are the policia armada , the armed police in their gray , red-trimmed uniforms and visored garrison caps . The policia armada are called out to quiet an obstreperous drunk or break up a barroom brawl or disperse an illegal meeting . They look like ushers in movie theaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very good at parades . The asaltos , the riot police in their black uniforms , are another matter . When they are called out it generally means trouble . They are not called out very often . The Civil Guards are not called out at all . They are simply there , like sidewalk flirts and blind lottery-ticket sellers and knife-sharpeners with their trilling pipes and camera-toting tourists . They are a quasi-military organization , and because the Spaniards fear them they make jokes about them . They make jokes about Franco too . The most common ornament in a Spanish car is a little Civil Guard doll , dressed in gray-green with a tricorn patent leather hat , smiling as he dangles in the rear window . If you are foolish enough to strike or even insult a Civil Guard , you will probably be hauled before a courtmartial . It is a military , not a civil offense , and eight to ten years in a military prison , with no packages from home , is the usual penalty . The Public Order Police wear no uniforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Catalan separatists , illegal labor activists , left-wing priests , and troublemakers in general . They are more educated and more prone to corruption than the Civil Guards , who look on them with mild contempt . They are subtle , patient infiltrators of the illegal left , and the Civil Guards prefer a more direct approach . All Spain 's police organizations but one  --  even , nominally , the Civil Guards  --  take their orders from the Director General of Security , Colonel Eduardo Santo Domingo . A large stocky man with shaven head , great liquid dark eyes , and a pursed rosebud of a mouth , he is just past fifty and wears dark suits  | tailored for him on Savile Row in London . A dedicated man , he is frustrated by two challenges to his authority . The first involves a matter of protocol . Colonel Santo Domingo is outranked by the general in command of the Civil Guards . This is no accident . Francisco Franco long ago learned that a confusion of protocol is an effective means of neutralizing two potentially dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a private police organization working out of offices on the second story of a red brick building on the Castellana in Madrid , a few doors down from the Plaza de Colon . It is a small , nameless group , and even Santo Domingo is unsure of its exact membership . A good guess , prior to Franco 's incapacitating stroke , would have been no more than fifty . A better guess , now , would put the figure as high as a hundred . The organization is growing , and Santo Domingo has been told repeatedly by Admiral Rojas Millan , the President , that its sole purpose is information gathering . Like the Public Order Police , it infiltrates . But whereas the Public Order Police infiltrates illegal groups , the Admiral 's private police force infiltrates various Directorates of the government  --  Information , Economics and Planning , Foreign Affairs . A political moderate , Santo Domingo fears that its ultimate purpose is a right wing coup d'etat . Six months ago he might have taken his concern to Franco . But now that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Colon at the head of the Castellana and looked at the statue of Columbus . Pigeons were bobbing their heads and cooing in the square . Jesus Quintana never broke stride and the pigeons , at the last moment ,  | reluctantly left the seeds and bread crumbs that tourists had been feeding them , flew off a few feet , and settled again . Quintana played that game with people too . He would walk , eyes straight ahead , through a crowd , and the preoccupied expression on his face would never change as a man or a woman , at the last moment , like the pigeons , would scuttle out of his way . He wondered sometimes if their thoughts , if they had any thoughts , were any more lucid than those of the pigeons . He wondered sometimes if they had any more awareness of their own existence than the statue of Columbus that dominated the square . People were objects to be manipulated , as easily as a rapidly striding man could manipulate the pigeons into flight , and Jesus Quintana took pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May . An eye-smarting smog from the petrochemical complex south of Madrid hung heavily in the air . It annoyed Quintana because he had no control over it . He wanted to say , smog , go away , and make it happen . But that would not work . He turned away from the statue of Columbus and made his way up the broad , acacia-bordered Castellana . He walked straight at a fat woman in a black dress and she lumbered to one side , giving him an angry look , and he felt better . Not yet two o'clock , he told himself , a ridiculously early hour for lunch , except for the tourists . The coffee shop of the Hilton Hotel would be crowded with them , swarms of Americans mostly , whose digestions had rebelled against garlic , olive oil , chorizo sausage and milk-fed lamb , and who would gobble hamburgers and banana splits while telling each other that the bullfights of San Isidro were a barbaric spectacle . Bullfighters were talented manipulators too , Quintana thought . Parar , templar , mandar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bull . But they did not know what they were  | missing . Playing the same game with human beings was infinitely more satisfying . Jesus Quintana was a lean , short man in his early forties with dark earnest eyes , a mane of black hair which grew down over his collar , and a carefully trimmed mustache . He rarely conducted business in his office on the second floor of the red brick building a few doors down from the Plaza de Colon . He preferred the anonymity of the streets , the noise of Madrid 's crowded cafes , and even the camouflage of the tourists in the Hilton coffee shop . Colonel Santo Domingo was already waiting in a booth against the far wall of the coffee shop , his bald head bent over the menu , which was illustrated with photographs for the benefit , Quintana supposed , of semiliterate tourists who could n't even read a bill of fare in their own language . The hostess preceded Quintana to the booth and placed one of the menus for illiterates on the formica tabletop as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look at the menu . " I 'll have a hamburger and a Coca-Cola , " he told the hostess in English . Santo Domingo looked up , his rosebud of a mouth pursed in a smile . " How can you eat that stuff ? " " When in Rome , " Jesus Quintana said . He had a point . Except for the staff , they were the only Spaniards in the place . A waitress in a yellow dress brought Santo Domingo 's lunch . It was the single Spanish specialty of the day , a Sacromonte omelette . With it came a copper-banded oak pitcher of white wine . When his hamburger came , Quintana opened the soft bun and flooded it with ketchup . The hamburger still tasted like chopped meat and sawdust . He shoved the plate aside . " I do this every once in a while to remind myself how lucky I am to be a Spaniard , " he said . 31  | " I can give you about fifteen minutes , " Santo Domingo told him . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if you can do a job down in Puerto Real , " Quintana said . Santo Domingo sighed . " It 's one of the biggest headaches of the year , Puerto Real . It 's almost as bad as Pamplona . We bring in a squad of asaltos and maybe a hundred extra Civil Guards from up and down the coast , and hope for the best . What 's the Admiral got in mind ? " " Franco 's going . " " You 're kidding me . " " No , he 's going . " Santo Domingo leaned forward . His shaven skull caught the overhead light . " It 's one thing when the Caudillo 's up in the president 's box at the bullring on his own two feet . It 's something else when they 've got to carry him there , expose him in public , and still convince him he 's Chief of State . Jesus Christ , why do n't they tell him the truth and let him die in peace ? " " Is that what you think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his face . Santo Domingo shifted in his seat . " How is he ? " Quintana watched a young American girl in tight slacks make her way toward the cash register . " Pretty good ass , " he observed . " You ca n't tell about the legs though . " " I asked , how is he ? " " Do n't you know ? " " I 'm just a cop . " " Same here , " said Quintana , dismissing the state of the Caudillo 's health while he drank half the Coca-Cola . " He 'll be staying in Puerto Real through Sunday . Open budget for you , Colonel . Put any police elements you need on temporary duty . We want a wall of security ten miles thick . " " Where will he be staying ? " 32  | " Private estate . The Salvatierra family has a place in Puerto . " Santo Domingo laughed rumblingly . " I like your sense of humor . Franco 's hostess , an anarchist . " " The duchess is in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's still her estate . " " Her cousin Alfonso 's in residence . He wo n't give us any trouble . " " Trouble ? He 'll trip over his noble feet trying to cooperate . " Quintana smiled faintly . " I 'll fly down to Puerto as soon as you line things up . " Santo Domingo finished his wine and tapped a knife against his glass to call the waitress . But Quintana sent her away with a gesture . " There 's one more thing , " he said . " I got a cousin on my wife 's side . A nice kid . A good worker . He did a hitch with the Civil Guards . You 'll like him . " " If you mean will I hire him , the answer is no . " " Give him a chance , he speaks three languages . " " Get him a job with Berlitz . " " His wife did n't like raising the family in a barracks . That 's reasonable , " Quintana said earnestly . " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor . " " I do n't owe you any favors . " The rudeness did not bother Quintana . Santo Domingo had no reason to like him . He was no easy man to like . In the same earnest voice he said : " You could be doing yourself a favor , too . " " The Direccion General de Seguridad , " Santo Domingo said , " will survive without your wife 's cousin on the payroll . " He called for the check a second time , and Quintana did not stop him . As they walked toward the cashier 's desk Quintana said : 33  | " At least you 'd know who he was . Think about it . One of these days I 'm going to get a man in your office . " Santo Domingo gave the check to the cashier and waited for change from his blue five-hundred-peseta note . " Maybe this will surprise you , " he said , " but I 'm in no hurry . Give my regards to the Admiral , please . " The Director General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cavernous , tourist-filled lobby of the hotel and outside , his back very straight as a uniformed buttons opened the plate glass door for him with white-gloved hands . Quintana stood in the lobby . He 'd had one success and one failure . The one had been as predictable as the other . He lit a Vencedor cigar . During the next week or so half a dozen of his people , all highly qualified , all with less obvious connections , would apply for a job with the Direccion General . Pretty soon he would get a man in there , and Santo Domingo would be another puppet he could play with . Stop the bull , control the bull , command the bull . It only worked when the bull had never been confronted with a dismounted man before . The bull began to learn , in the twenty minutes of life left to him , that the man was something he could hit with his horns , but by the time he learned it fully he would be dead . For twenty minutes the diversionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elusive matador . The Admiral , seventy-year-old de facto ruler of Spain while Franco stubbornly refused to die , was Jesus Quintana 's cape . Santo Domingo would be his picador , his lance-wielding horseman , whose job it was to protect the matador by giving the bull a false confidence and at the same time weakening the tossing muscle behind the bull 's great head . The bullfighter Ricardo Diaz would be Quintana 's sword , for the killing of the bull . Quintana went outside . The smog was worse . He looked at 34  | his watch . The bullfighter would be even easier to manipulate than Colonel Santo Domingo . A taxi stopped in front of the main entrance of University City . Two Civil Guards stood in front of the striped sawhorse that blocked the driveway . The younger one dropped a cigarette and ground it under his black leather boot . The driver looked at them uneasily . " Should I wait , maestro ? " Ricardo Diaz paid him . " No , that 's all right . I 'll walk back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The younger Civil Guard took two slow , arrogant strides toward Diaz , a thumb hooking the leather strap of his machine pistol . " Turn around and keep moving , man , " he said . " I just wanted to walk inside a few minutes , " Diaz said . " Walk down by the river then . Not here . " The older Civil Guard came over . He had gray hair and a paunch . " You 're Ricardo Diaz , are n't you ? Why do you want to go inside ? " Diaz shrugged . " No real reason . It 's not important . It 's a good place to walk . " " It 's shut . It 's off limits , " said the younger Civil Guard . " Never mind , then . " Diaz said , and started to walk away . The older Civil Guard called him back . " This one , " he said contemptuously , " has no use for bullfights . He has aficion for football . " " I ca n't afford the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afford . " His companion spat on the ground . " A man affords what he wants to afford . I 'll afford a trip to Puerto Real 35  | next Sunday , to see Ricardo Diaz give the alternativa to his son . Can he fight , maestro ? " " I hope so , " Ricardo Diaz said . " You want to go inside ? " " It 's not important . " " But if you want to . " Diaz watched the older Civil Guard raise one end of the sawhorse that blocked the driveway and move it far enough so that a man could walk through . " Have a pleasant stroll , maestro . " Diaz thanked him and entered the campus . He heard the older Civil Guard saying : " You 'd tell the Pope it 's off limits , keep moving . Twenty years from now maybe you 'll make corporal . " " Mierda , " said the younger Civil Guard while his companion replaced the sawhorse . Ricardo Diaz stood in front of the three-story Faculty of Philosophy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . He drew the smoke deep into his lungs and looked at the broken windows of the red brick building . Shards of glass glinted in the boxwood hedge below them . The acrid tomcat smell of the boxwood was strong . Nobody had repaired the windows smashed in the last riot . Nobody had replaced the bricks chipped and broken by gunfire during the riot before that . A voice inside Ricardo Diaz 's head spoke : Look , Dad . I 'm not Al . Al was a different kind of guy . A line of black-uniformed asaltos had cordoned off the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters , a year ago . They carried trun-36  | cheons and shields and wore helmets with plastic face masks . The students , led by a red-haired American named Davis or David or something like that , came rushing over from the direction of the University Hospital . There were two or three hundred of them . Running at Davis or David 's right was Maria Teresa , Duchess of Salvatierra , La Quijota . At his left , sprinting hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alberto Diaz , glasses askew on the bridge of his nose . Some of the students began throwing stones . They rattled against the plastic shields of the asaltos . They broke some windows . Then the asaltos moved forward and used their truncheons . A few students screamed . A few of them fell down . They retreated and regrouped outside the hospital . Alberto 's glasses were broken . He plucked them off his face and threw them away . Without them his eyes had a vague and confused look . A few minutes before the first attempt to storm the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters , which had been shut because a professor had made an inflammatory speech against the army , Ricardo Diaz had tried to reason with his older son . " You 're just a kid . You do n't understand these things . " It had been the wrong thing to say . " Bullfighting must give you a keen insight into politics , " Alberto told him . The words could have been Maria Teresa 's . " It wo n't get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come over . " Who 's this joker ? " " My father , " said Alberto , embarrassed . " Well now , the famous bullfighter , " said Davis or David . " Friend of the rich and privileged , friend of Franco , friend of ? " " They close down schools in the States too , " Ricardo Diaz said . " Dad , it 's something we 've got to do , " Alberto told him uneasily . 37  | " I 'm walking out of here . You 're coming with me . " A woman 's voice said : " Leave him alone , Ricardo , " and he was looking at Maria Teresa . " I 'll talk to you later . Al ? " " I 'm sorry , Dad , " Alberto said , and Davis or David shouted : " All right , what are we waiting for ? Let 's go get it ! " The first unsuccessful rush on the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters got them a few bruises and broken bones . A squad of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they broke the first attack on the building . The Civil Guards had n't helped them . Help had not been necessary . The second rush of the students carried them to the broad white granite staircase . The line of asaltos wavered . A few students climbed the stairs , with Davis or David leading the way . Ricardo Diaz saw the American beat one of the asaltos to his knees with his own truncheon . The hard rubber club rose and fell in the sunlight . The asalto 's helmet fell off . Davis or David kept pounding him . A black van came very fast between the University Hospital and the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters . It jolted to a stop . More asaltos poured out , carrying sawed-off shotguns and wearing gas masks . A whistle blew , and the new asaltos formed a line . When the whistle shrilled again , they fired tear gas grenades at the foot of the granite staircase . The grenades thunked and hissed , spewing thick yellow clouds of gas . Coughing and retching , blinded , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attack on the black asalto van , and even then the Civil Guards stood calmly by , impassively observing the riot but ready for real trouble in the event the asaltos could not handle it . Ricardo Diaz wondered what real trouble was . The asaltos fired more grenades , Davis or David crumpled choking to the grass , and the students broke . 38  | Suddenly , from the thinning cloud of gas at the base of the stairs , Alberto burst out running . He squinted nearsightedly without his glasses . He rubbed his tear-streaming eyes . In one hand he gripped a truncheon . He saw  --  or possibly , Ricardo Diaz realized afterwards , he did not see  --  the black van , the gas-mask-wearing asaltos , the Civil Guards standing to one side . He ran toward the Civil Guards , waving the truncheon overhead , shouting : " No ! You 've got to stop ! Make them stop ! " Maria Teresa saw where he was running , and came after him . The Civil Guard sergeant pushed the black patent leather hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The faintest of speculative smiles touched his face as he watched Alberto running awkwardly . He brought his machine pistol up , butt under his right arm , stubby barrel pointing at Alberto . He 's enjoying this , Ricardo Diaz thought . By then Diaz was running too . He called Alberto 's name . He heard shouts and coughing . Davis or David sat on the ground , vomiting into his lap . Strands of tear gas hanging in the air made Ricardo Diaz 's eyes smart , but he could see Alberto , knees pumping high , left arm flailing , right hand overhead with the truncheon , and he could see the Civil Guard with his machine pistol and his smile . He thought he would reach Alberto in time . He had to reach Alberto in time . He heard a crumping sound , and a tear gas grenade erupted at his feet , spewing its hissing yellow cloud . He stumbled . He fell and rolled over and got up . It was a while before he could see , at first not clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sergeant stood looking down at the ground a few yards in front of him , where Maria Teresa sat on the grass , crying , her white slacks bloody , Alberto 's head cradled in her arms , the three machine pistol slugs stitched across his face . 39  | It had n't been much of a riot , really . The asaltos had kept property damage to a minimum . There were a few broken bones . Only one student had died . After the funeral , he saw the Civil Guard commander in his office in Madrid . The general could do nothing beyond what already had been done . The sergeant had been reprimanded , reduced in rank , and posted to the provinces , where it was unlikely he would be confronted with rioting students . The general was respectful but not apologetic . Colonel Santo Domingo , Director General of Security , was apologetic but not helpful . What can you do with a triggerhappy fool ? he asked . You send him to the Pyrenees or the mountains of Ronda , to watch for smugglers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privileges that go with rank . He was doing his duty , as he saw his duty . I commiserate with you in your loss , Don Ricardo . Was the boy political ? He was an awkward , earnest , budding intellectual who wore thick glasses and , in the months before he died , had followed Maria Teresa around like a puppy . But Ricardo Diaz did not say that . Maria Teresa was then on trial herself . That summer he took the train to Galicia , the northwest corner of the country , a hilly green misty land that looked more like Scotland than Spain . The train was new and shiny , with low-slung aluminum coaches . The rails spanned gorges and tunnelled through mountains and ended at El Ferrol , now El Ferrol del Caudillo , Franco 's birthplace . Franco , in his prime , went whale-hunting from El Ferrol . It was n't much of a city . The dun-colored buildings huddled close 40  | to the naval shipyard at the head of the inlet , the green hills rolled off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at quayside . The Direccion General de Turismo had built a parador so tourists could visit Franco 's birthplace in some comfort . They were usually disappointed with what they saw . Franco 's whale-hunting days were over , but he still sailed aboard the converted minesweeper Maria de la 0 , named for one of his granddaughters . He invited Ricardo Diaz aboard , and after Maria de la 0 had cruised down the inlet and south toward La Coruna , the two men met alone in the grand saloon . Maria de la 0 plowed through low choppy swells under a leaden sky . Franco 's appearance startled Ricardo Diaz  --  the scrawny neck , like a rooster 's , the right hand shaking uncontrollably with palsy , the slackly hanging jaw . He had dressed nautically for the occasion , in a white yachting cap and navy blue doublebreasted blazer . " You know , Don Ricardo , " he said , sipping sherry from a glass held in his left hand , the palsied right hand out of sight below the table , " when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His always shrill monotone was high and almost childlike now . " Traditionally , the sons of my family became naval officers . They did n't take me . I was too short , they said . So I joined the army . I wonder where I would be now , had the navy overlooked a few centimeters . " He rambled on , as an old man will . He asked about Diaz 's wife , not remembering that she had died more than three years ago . He asked how long it had been since he had last had the pleasure of Diaz 's company . It had been two years . Ricardo Diaz had hunted ibex in the Gredos Mountains with the Caudillo . Juan Carlos de Borbon y BorbOn , in his mid-thirties then , grandson of Spain 's last king , had joined the hunting party . 41  | Juan Carlos would be proclaimed king after Franco 's death . 1 le had not been much of an ibex hunter . When the old man paused in his rambling , Ricardo Diaz leaned forward , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I came here to see you about my son , Excellency . " Franco sighed . He stood slowly , his short legs planted wide against the pitching of Maria de la O. " I knew you had come for that , of course . What are we going to do , Don Ri-cardo ? " " Have the man court-martialed . " " Don Ricardo , I do n't know what to tell you . I ca n't help you . I wish I could . " " He murdered my son . " " I would not have called it murder . " " I was there , Excellency . " " And I have the reports . It was an unfortunate affair . Perhaps the man was overzealous . He has a good record . He was punished , within the structure of his career . " " That 's not enough . " " Don Ricardo , listen to me . Try to understand , Spain is a land of many lands . The Catalan hates the Madrileno , the Gallego shepherd does n't trust the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone makes fun of the men of Murcia . The Church complains when I give too much power to the army , the landowners complain because I bring Opus Dei men into my cabinet . The Falange sees its power corrode and thinks I have betrayed the cause . The intellectuals want to jump over the Pyrenees in the blink of an eye and join the rest of Europe . But despite all this confusion , despite all this anarchy , Spain survives , Spain prospers . Do you know why ? " Ricardo Diaz said , more impatiently than he had intended , that he did not know why . " Certain things can be relied on , Don Ricardo . The sacra-42  | ments of the Church . The loyalty of the army . The confidence of the Civil Guards . " " I have no confidence in the Civil Guards . They 're men , like anyone else . " " 1 did not say confidence in , Don Ricardo . I said confidence of . They know the government stands behind them . The knowledge makes them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Civil Guards . " " They fear them . " " A little wholesome fear is a good thing , Don Ricardo . " Franco smiled suddenly . " As any bullfighter knows . " " I did n't come here to talk about the bulls , Excellency , " Ricardo Diaz said . Franco 's eyes narrowed , and Diaz thought he had gone too far . But the old man said : " Let me put it this way , Don Ricardo . The Civil Guards are a few thousand poorly paid men and a mystique . It is the mystique that is important . Their mistakes , their unfortunate mistakes , are dust we must sweep under the carpet . They control a nation of thirty million anarchists , thanks to the mystique . They can do no wrong . " Franco finished his sherry . " No , I wish I could help you , Don Ricardo . But what you ask is impossible . " There was a finality in the statement and in the way Franco sat down again , the concern on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They could now make small talk , cruising in the choppy gray water south toward La Coruna , the dictator and his privileged guest . " Tell me , will you fight the bulls again ? Buenavista came out of retirement twice , Dominguin twice , even El Cordobes . Once the worm gnaws at you there is no escape , eh Don Ricardo ? Will you fight again ? " " Excellency , " said Ricardo Diaz slowly , " I 'm still not ready to change the subject . " The old man 's eyes blinked . The left hand clutched the right 43  | hand . The Caudillo 's face was no longer amiable . " You are not , " he said , " but I am . " " I want justice . " " Yes ? What kind of justice do you want ? The kind your good friend the Duchess of Salvatierra wanted , or the kind she got ? She has been exiled for life , you know , for wanting what she calls justice . I am an old man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me what justice truly is . The duchess is a fool . Your son was misguided . I can not help you . " Ricardo Diaz stood . He felt the flesh over his cheekbones and around his mouth drawing tight . " Then I was a fool too , " he said . " For thinking you could . " The two men looked at each other . With his palsied right hand Francisco Franco slowly picked up the phone . An hour later Ricardo Diaz walked down the gangway of Maria de la 0 and past the red and gold Spanish flag snapping in the wind at the head of the inlet in the town where Franco had been born . By late afternoon the wind had changed in Madrid , blowing the smog away from the river and the Casa del Campo , the old royal hunting preserve that bordered University City . Ricardo Diaz walked back across the deserted campus . His son was dead , the Civil Guard was dead , Franco was dying . What had coming here proven ? Even flying to Madrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least that had n't been his idea . The man he had reached by phone from Kate Cameron 's villa had arranged to meet him outside the Gran Corillo Restaurant on Calle Serrano at three in the afternoon . 44  | He had called the Acro Club early , so they would have the twin-engined Cessna ready . He 'd made the flight in two hours , over the mountains and the flat tableland of La Mancha and into the Castillian smog . A taxi got him from Barajas Airport to Calle Serrano by two-thirty and he walked over to the Velazquez Hotel and had a quick drink at the bar , then went back . It was a posh neighborhood . Mitzou sold her leather creations there , Domo sold Bidassoa china , and so did Cartuja around the Corner on Calle Goya . You could buy dolls at Mariquita Perez , and tile coffee tables and garden furniture at Rohan . Or you could wait on the sidewalk outside the Gran Corillo , where they served the best snacks in Madrid , until a man came up to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one trouble with a celebrity . They 're starting to recognize you . " They were . Ricardo Diaz could see heads turning , could hear his name spoken . The man took his arm lightly and they began to walk along Serrano . He was a trim man conservatively dressed in a lightweight suit . He wore his dark hair down over his collar and had a mustache , but so did half the men loitering on the sidewalk outside the Corillo . He did not avoid passersby on the crowded street . He walked right at them and they got out of his way . " There 's another thing about a celebrity , " he said . " They live high , they know the right people , they get the idea they 're untouchable . Do n't you get that idea , matador . It would be a mistake . " Ricardo Diaz shook free of the hand that held his arm . " You make me wait six months before getting in touch with me , " he said , his voice flat with constrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hours ' notice . All right , I 'm here . I did n't fly here to listen to any lectures . " " Do you think waiting six months was my idea ? The situa-45  | tion got out of control . I did n't like that any better than you did , believe me . " The trim man stepped off the curb . A car screeched to a stop , the driver shaking his fist and shouting . They crossed the street toward Mitzou 's green-framed display window . " Pretty expensive joint . Thirty thousand pesetas for a leather coat , that 's a lot of money . You 're not exactly set up for life , are you ? " The man named a figure , an enormous sum , more than Ricardo Diaz had earned in his final successful and disastrous season of fighting the bulls . " I know what you 're thinking , matador . How do you know when an extortionist will stop ? We 're hoping the money will convince you . It 's yours , along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sound ? " Without waiting for an answer , the man returned his attention to Mitzou 's window . " That 's the best window display in Madrid , " he said . " Just a few items , carefully arranged . Not a lot of junk cluttering up the display . I admire professionalism , matador . It was a pleasure watching you work in Malaga . But then , you are a professional . How many bulls  --  three thousand ? That 's a lot of killing . We even admired your choice of a weapon . A knife . No noise , no chance of missing , and if you use it right the victim 's dead before he knows what 's happening to him . The trouble with some people , they ca n't use a knife . A gun 's more impersonal . I 'm glad a knife does n't make you squeamish . " Ricardo Diaz stared at the leather coat in Mitzou 's window , and at the small bronze plaque that discreetly stated the price . They want me to kill someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be having a busy week down in Puerto . Just do n't be hard to find . I 'll be getting in touch with you in a few days . " 46  | " I 'll be there , " Ricardo Diaz said . I ie knew he would probably do what they wanted , knew he had to do it , and that came as no surprise either . " Do n't make any plans for Sunday after the fight . You 'll be going to a banquet at Castillo del Moro . That 's the Salvatierra estate . " " I know who owns Castillo del Moro . " " Of course . You and the duchess  --  that was n't exactly the best kept secret in Spain . " Ricardo Diaz said : " Who do I have to kill ? " " Do n't go jumping to conclusions , matador . You waited six months , you can wait a few more days . You 'll get a briefing in Puerto before Sunday night . " The man glanced at his watch and turned away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , Ricardo Diaz realized suddenly , the meeting was over . " Wait a minute , " he said . " Now just wait a goddamn minute . You could have told me that much on the phone . " The man looked at him for a moment impatiently . " I do n't like doing business on the phone . I like to see who I 'm dealing with . " Then his eyes seemed to go out of focus . They looked like glass eyes under the thick mane of dark hair . " I 'll see you down in Puerto . You can count on it . " Ricardo Diaz stood on the crowded sidewalk watching the trim man walk quickly along Serrano , not getting out of anyone 's way . Now at University City he went down the driveway to the gate . The older Civil Guard moved the sawhorse . " A pleasant walk , matador ? " " Ver y " " I 'll be in Puerto on Sunday . " " I 'll look for you then . " " Good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he walked past . 47  | Antonio Buenavista was waiting for him in the library of Rancho Andaluz . The old bullfighter , a bottle of San Miguel beer in his big right fist , a dead cigar clamped between his teeth , said : " You sure have a lot of books . Ever read any of them ? " " Sometimes , " Ricardo Diaz said . " They teach you anything ? " " That I 'm pretty dumb , even for an ex-bullfighter . " " You got a whole damn university in here . This room really gets me , " Buenavista said . Ricardo Diaz did not doubt it . When he visited the ranch , Buenavista sooner or later wound up in the library , as if he had to see it with his own eyes to believe it . 49  | Buenavista finished the beer . l le set the bottle in a row with four other empties on the big walnut desk . lie put the dead cigar back between his teeth . " Where were you ? Nobody knew where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . " " In your own plane ? You and that crazy Benitez , your own planes , " Buenavista said , shaking his head . " In the old days we used to drive all night eating cold chicken and maybe some wine out of a bota , and then with a couple hours sleep we 'd fight the bulls and be on the road again the next night . If you fought seventy , eighty bulls a year then , you really knew it . You ached all the way down to the seat of your pants . " Buenavista smiled uneasily . Usually he was n't so garrulous . He heaved himself to his feet abruptly and stood facing Ricardo Diaz . " You 'd better get into Torremolinos . " Diaz looked at his watch . It was almost midnight . " What is it ? " " Maybe nothing . Me , I 'm an old-fashioned guy . " Again the uneasy smile . " I think that kid of yours has a good chance . I 'd hate to see him throw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dropped in for a beer . He was drunk three hours ago but holding it . I could n't pry him loose . " " Where ? " " Try Harry 's Bar . " The expatriate American who had once said , " Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway , " to Mr. Ernest Hemingway during the fiesta in Pamplona , was now an habitue of Harry 's Bar in  | Torremolinos . It was not like I larry 's Bar in Paris , which you reached by telling the cab driver " Sank Roo Doe Noo , " a clubby place with college pennants decorating the woodpanelled walls , and it was not like Harry 's Bar in Venice , just off the Piazza San Marco , where the bartenders knew how to mix a martini that was a work of art . The name was a good idea , though , and the Harry 's Bar in Torremolinos , a small place on the Plaza Gamba Alegre , was generally crowded with American and British tourists . The story had got around over the years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway , either before or after Mr. Ernest Hemingway had thrown a wineskin at his head . The man who had said Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway , was a permanent fixture at Harry 's Bar . He did not contradict the embellishments fifteen years had wrought on the story . It was now accepted that he had offered to take Mr. Ernest Hemingway apart , limb by limb , even though Mr. Ernest Hemingway had considered himself a pretty damn good fighter . Mr. Ernest Hemingway had not taken up the challenge . What the embellished story ignored were the physical conditioning and age of the two antagonists that night in Pamplona . Mr. Ernest Hemingway had been sick and sixty , and the man who had said Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway , had been neither . A short , wiry man , he had lived off the reputation of his bravery ever since , and off his reputation as an expert on the bullfights , and Torremolinos was a good place to do both . Antonio Ordoiiez , who had known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer had been a gentleman , except when drunk . Drunk , he had been a mean , needling son of a bitch . He had been drunk most of the time that year . Ordoiiez had no opinion about the habitue of Harry 's Bar in Torremolinos . The man who had said Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway , was expounding on the decadence of the bullfight for the benefit 51  | of half a dozen aging British types when Ricardo Diaz entered Harry 's Bar . Dim , smoky and quiet , except for the man 's voice , it did not seem the sort of place that Jose Carlos would try to drink dry . Maybe the clientele changed with the hour , Ricardo Diaz thought . " I ask you , who do they have these days ? " the man who had said Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway , was saying in a spurious Irish accent . " Linares ? He 's a bird-boned boy with a few clever tricks and a way of killing so fast you ca n't tell if he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miguel Marquez ? Show me what he 's done in Madrid . Never mind your Malaga or Puerto Real bullfights , it 's Madrid that counts . No , I tell you , the bullfight 's in a hopeless state of decline . " " You have to consider Ricardo Diaz , do n't you ? " asked one of the aging British types . The man who had said Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway , smiled a quirky , engaging smile . " Do you ? Diaz looked so good because the rest of them were so bad . " " He 's coming out of retirement . " " Long enough to give the sword to his son , if you call that coming out of retirement . Let me tell you about the son . It so happens he was in here earlier this evening . " Ricardo Diaz said : " You would n't happen to know where he went ? " There was a silence , and then one of the aging British types whispered : " Why , I believe it is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway , turned pale . " This is a real pleasure , matador . I was just telling my friends here ? " " Do you know where he went ? " The man looked at his audience , and at Ricardo Diaz . The aging British types seemed to give him courage . " I doubt that he went home , " he said with a spiteful smile . " He was here ,  | all right , two , three hours ago and two , three sheets to the wind . Well , he 's young . You know what El Gallo , one of the greatest of them all , used to say about training ? The bull weighed more than half a ton ; he weighed a hundred sixty pounds . Training ? i le stayed in training by smoking Havana cigars . Buy you a drink , matador ? " " Did he leave alone ? " " In Torremolinos ? A good-looking kid like that ? He had a blond on each arm . Built , the pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniards . If they 're two yards tall and blond , they 're always Swedes . As a matter of fact , they were American . " The man who had said Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway , looked steadily at Ricardo Diaz . " The other boy with them said he knew a place where they could turn on . " " Where ? " " That 's one business I do n't fool around with , not in Spain . The kids want it , they can get it . I do n't want to know where . " " This one time I guess you do , " Ricardo Diaz said in a flat voice , and suddenly the man who had said Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway , found it difficult to meet his eyes . " What the hell , " he said , " if I were you I 'd try The Cane jOn . The kids call it Sally 's Alley . That 's the owner 's name , Sally . It 's on San Miguel . " " I know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to call Late Spanish Ugly and it was , Ricardo Diaz observed , pretty ugly even by the honky-tonk standards of Calle San Miguel , which had been 53  | the main street of a sleepy Spanish fishing village fifteen years ago and now was the midway of what Maria Teresa called Miami Beach East . Stained glass chips in a frozen kaleidoscopic pattern decorated the double doors , varicolored globes cast a garish light on the bar , stucco stalactites hung from the low ceiling . Chairs and tables were turn-of-the-century American ice-cream parlor wrought iron , with bright red plastic cushions on the chairs and mosaic-tile tabletops . A few bullfight posters pasted on the wall faced the mounted head of a bull behind the bar . With inwardcurving horns , a protruding tongue , and dull hide , it was neither a very good-looking bull nor a very good job of taxidermy . The plaque said the bull had been killed by the British matador Henry Higgins in the bullring of Torremolinos . The bar was closed , bottles arranged neatly on the backbar , glasses polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wax . An acne-faced boy was plucking an occasional chord from a reluctant guitar at one of the tables . Three flat-chested girls in black turtlenecks sat with him clapping an ersatz flamenco rhythm without enthusiasm . A fourth had her head down , her dark hair spread like a placemat on the table . Ricardo Diaz rapped his knuckles on the bar . The hair placemat detached itself from the table , and a flatchested girl in a black turtleneck came over . The closer she approached , the older she looked . Her lined face was age-puckered around the thin slit of a mouth . She started out looking eighteen at the other end of the room and was pushing a dissipated fifty by the time she reached the bar . Her eyes were bloodshot . " Say , do n't I know you ? " she asked . " I do n't think so . " " I swear I know you from somewhere . Wait a minute , you 're Antonio Ordonez , are n't you ? "  | " My name 's Diaz . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew I 'd seen you before . " She jerked her mop of dark hair toward a stucco archway at the end of the bar . " Every third word out of their mouths downstairs , it 's Diaz . That kid of yours really blows their minds . Sexy looking too . I see where he gets it . There 's a definite resemblance . " Ricardo Diaz started to move past her , but she caught his arm . " You want him ? I 'll go get him . " " Thanks , I 'll get him myself . " The bloodshot eyes blinked . " There 's a little kind of a problem . " " I know you 're selling it and I know they 're smoking it , " Ricardo Diaz said . " Well , I got to be careful . Spain . " Diaz brushed past her and went toward the archway . " Listen , " she called after him . " He 's a tiny bit spaced out right now . This is none of my business , but something 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I 'd go easy on him . " The stairs were dark . He had to grope his way down between the stucco walls . He saw dim light below him . He smelled cloying incense and something pungent : attar of roses and hash , the scent of the now generation 's church , he thought with the frustration and rage that had been building in him since Madrid . He halted at the bottom of the stairs . At first he thought he would go in there after Jose Carlos . A little hash was one thing in the States but it could get you five years in jail in Spain , even if you were Ricardo Diaz 's son . But something made him wait while his eyes adjusted to the dimness . Three incense candles lit the small cellar room , their light flickering on the stucco walls . In the center of the floor a coarse blanket had been spread . Two blond girls wearing faded denim jackets and jeans held down opposite corners , both 55  | with their heads down staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and said : " Careful , huh ? You ca n't just waltz into any schoolyard and get it around here . That 's pretty good stuff . " Carefully , without taking a drag , Jose Carlos passed a small clay pipe , and the girl with granny glasses took a long pull on it before passing it to the blond boy on her left . He inhaled deeply and gave the pipe to the other girl . She took a drag , coughed , and returned it to Jose Carlos . He looked at it , made a face , and passed it back to the girl with granny glasses . " Am I ever spaced out , " the second girl said . They all sat there for a while , saying nothing , doing nothing . The granny glasses caught the candlelight , making the girl look eyeless and alien . She tapped ash from the bowl of the pipe into a platter on the blanket , reached into her pocket and withdrew a metal tin . She thumbed coarse brown hash into the pipe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who shook his head . " Do n't you want any more ? That 's real Moroccan kif , J.C . " " I guess I do n't want any more . " The other girl said : " J.C . ' s got other things on his mind . He 's waiting to do his thing on Sunday . " " Sure , that 's it , " Jose Carlos said . The pipe had come around to him again and he passed it to the second girl and sat there , head down , hands on denim knees . " I never even saw a bullfight , " said the girl without granny glasses . " It must be , you know , scary . " Her hand moved in slow motion and touched Jose Carlos ' cheek . She began to caress it . Languidly he pushed the hand away . " Like wow , " said the blond boy in a bored voice . " No , I mean it . What do you think about when you kill the bull , J.C. ? " Jose Carlos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | At first he said nothing , and then he said : " I have two passports . You know ? American passport . Spanish . When I 'm twenty-one I get to choose . " " Is that what you think about ? " the girl asked . " Burn the American one , " the blond boy said . " My older brother burned his draft card in Harvard Yard . " The girl with granny glasses looked up long enough to say , " Far out , the great big moment in his life , " then let her head fall again . Jose Carlos said : " I had a brother once . " He ran a hand across his face . " He had two passports , same as me . That did n't stop them from killing him . Maybe I do n't want either one of them . I guess I do n't know what I want . " " My old man knows what I want , " the blond boy said . " He sells Pontiacs in Worcester , Mass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " J.C . ' s old man 's the greatest bullfighter in Spain . That 's a different kind of thing . " " On another fucking planet , " said the blond boy . Jose Carlos looked at him , and the boy said : " My old man wants me to come home and sell Pontiacs . After college , I mean . Everything comes after college . Diaz 's old man wants him to stay home and fight the bulls . There 's a difference ? " " I 'm too spaced out to argue , " said the girl with granny glasses . " There 's a difference , " said the other girl . " There 's a whole world of difference in , you know , concept . " Jose Carlos stared at her a long time . The pipe came back to him . He sucked on it and held the smoke in his lungs . " Is there ? " he said after a while , and then the four of them passed around the pipe and were silent . Ricardo Diaz turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant guitar held down the table in 57  | back . A stylishly dressed woman of about thirty-five was arguing with the woman named Sally . " ? keep away from my husband , you fifty-year-old whore , " she was saying . " I am not fifty , " Sally said , and the stylishly dressed woman began to laugh and then changed her mind and began to cry and ran out . " Well ? " Sally asked Ricardo Diaz . " Do n't tell him I was here . " " No , you ca n't tell them , can you ? They make you feel so old , you know what I mean ? I was born a goddamn generation too soon , and I opened the wrong can of-worms . Those kids 'll make mistakes , but they wo n't be the same kind of mistakes . God . Oh God , I wish I was one of them . " She poured herself half a tumbler of brandy and drank it in two gulps . " I am not fifty , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded , like the midway of a carnival . 58  | Francisco Franco studied the image he saw in the gilded mirror , like a man sizing up an antagonist he has met face-to-face for the first time . Except for a few wisps of clinging white hair , the small head was bald . The nose was aquiline and , he had always liked to think , sensitive . It had a pinched look now . The white mustache was almost invisible against the pallor of his skin , and the thin-lipped mouth sagged even more these days . Only the dark opaque eyes seemed familiar . They stared back at him , trapped in the ravaged face . It was the face of a very old man who had been close to death and who lived now with the knowledge that he might die at any time , this morning , tomorrow , next week . Of course , 59  | Franco told himself , all men live with that knowledge : only fools pretend an unawareness of it . But this was different . He looked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheelchair and rolled across Carmen 's bedroom , wheels gliding silently over the Persian carpet . His own spartan bedroom across the hall of the Pardo Palace had been too small for the medical impedimenta that had thus far kept him alive . He felt ill at ease in Carmen 's bedroom , uncomfortable in the clutter of rococo furniture , out of place between the gilded walls and Goya and Velazquez tapestries . It was better than the hospital , though . In the hospital he had been trapped inside the oxygen tent , and the whole world was outside and for a long time he had nothing to do with it . His thoughts had come in odd random snatches , like flipping open the pages of a book and reading a few lines here and there . His name , for example . Franco y Bahamonde . Father 's name , mother 's name . Like Colon , who had discovered America and whose statue stood in Madrid , both Franco and Bahamonde were Jewish names . He wondered how many generations back he would have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid exile or the Inquisition . He wondered if that was why he had once opened the French border to refugees fleeing from Hitler 's final solution to the Jewish problem . Or his brother Ramon . Ramon had been the famous Franco when they were young  --  Ramon the dashing aviator , first to fly solo across the South Atlantic ; Ramon the adventurer , participant in abortive coups d'etat while his older brother less flamboyantly pursued his military career in Spanish Morocco and became the youngest general in Spain and in all Europe since Napoleon . Or Prime Minister Casares Quiroga letting the motherland fall into anarchy while he lay dying of tuberculosis , or the 60  | politician Calvo Sotelo taken from his own bedroom and shot to death by the asaltos in a police van while the churches burned in Madrid and Barcelona and a man took his life in his hands if he wore a necktie . Or General Cabanellas , seventy-five years old , a former Republican , reading the decree in the great cathedral of Burgos that gave all power to Francisco Franco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vied for that power  --  Sanjurjo and Mola , their planes crashing , Jose Antonio , the Falange leader who had always hated Franco , executed in Alicante by a Republican firing squad . Or what should have been the most important day of his life , the taking of Madrid in March 1939 . And where was Generalissimo Franco ? Sick in bed at his military headquarters , suffering from exhaustion and flu while the Army of Africa and the blue-shirted Falangists and the requetes with their red berets paraded along the Castellana . Francisco Franco would arrive later in his tasseled legionnaire forage cap and khaki uniform ? Franco , who had borrowed enough of his wife 's religion to believe he had saved Spain from the Antichrist . But what did it all matter ? Carmen 's rococo bedroom was his world . He slept most of the time . Twice a day a man came to massage his arms and legs and to sponge-bathe him and change the bedding . When they took the oxygen tent away they began to feed him liquids . Or , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liquids through a glass tube . That was better than the tube in his nose . Anything was better than the tube in his nose or the bedpan . Silly things , really , but they had taken away his pride . He had recognized Carmen immediately , even in the hospital . She spoke words , and he understood the words , and inside his head waited words he would say in reply . They would not come out . A scrambling of the intricate circuits between brain 61  | and tongue , Dr. Caballero explained later , but he hardly listened . He did not like Dr. Caballero . He never had . It was better when he could speak a few words , haltingly , in even more of a monotone than usual . It was better when Carmen would sit on the edge of the bed and hold his hand . But he did not really care . The time of not caring persisted . His thoughts became more coherent , he could think in a straight line for minutes on end , he could sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside world : men shoveling snow in the car park , the arrival of Dr. Caballero 's Citroen , the guards making their rounds , then less snow and finally no snow , and buds on the trees and rain and sunshine . But he did not care . His time in the world was over . His days consisted of Carmen 's visits , the massaging , Dr. Caballero 's visits , the medicine which he took obediently , an increasing ability to match words to thoughts , to control the movements of his arms and legs , and not caring about any of it . They had taken his pride . They had not been able to do otherwise , but the fact remained . Even Carmen , with her sympathy . It is very difficult , he told himself , for a vegetable to appreciate sympathy . And then the not caring went away . It happened suddenly , two months ago , in March , a grim dark day with cold rain sluicing down the windows and the lights on in the room even though it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to know . Sometimes , then , he made mistakes with words , the brain-to-lips messages confused , and he wanted to say one thing and said another or halted and waited and began to sweat because the word was there inside his head but he could not make it reach his mouth . He was sitting up . He asked , very carefully , like a tape played at too slow a speed : " Is the Admiral premier ? Have they proclaimed Juan Carlos king ? " 62  | Carmen looked at his face . She touched his cheek . Tears stood bright in her eyes . " The succession , " he said in his slow tape-recorder voice . " I should have prepared . Forces  --  this one , that . The Church . Opus Dei . The Army . They could , " he stopped . He had the word inside but could not get it out , and then he could . " Destroy Spain . Tear it apart . Forty years . Almost forty years for nothing . " " The Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlos is the heir apparent . They 're waiting . Nothing has changed . " " What are they waiting for ? " " You , " she said . And he did not understand , and then because he desperately wanted to , he did understand . He would get well . If he cared . If he tried . He had been Spain . He could be Spain again . He looked forward after that with impatience to the massaging and the whirlpool baths , and he did whatever they told him except when they told him to stop . Five more minutes , he said . Ten more minutes . His speech improved . One day Dr. Caballero and the male nurse helped him from bed , and he thought it was time to sit in the wheelchair at the window . That was seven weeks ago . He saw the walker , four wheels and aluminum bars on three sides , and a fourth that fastened in back . They positioned him in it . He gripped the bar in front and took a step . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheels rolled smoothly . He took three steps and applied pressure with his right hand and turned the walker and came back across the room . His right leg dragged , the foot turned in . Enough for now , Excellency , Dr. Caballero said , but he walked the walker across the room a second time and turned and came back . He used it more every day , and then he used aluminum crutches . He was frail . He had lost a great deal of weight . His flesh 63  | hung like sagging drapery . He had palsy in both hands , and they shaved him and dressed him until he made them stop . Shaving with a straight razor took a long time , but he could do it . Dressing was an accomplishment , a skill to be learned like hunting whales from the deck of Maria de la 0 with a harpoon gun . He learned it . Soon they allowed him a daily cup of wine , Villa del Perdon , the fruit-smelling , clay-tasting red wine of Navarra that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small portion of centolla , the delicate crabmeat chopped and spiced and served in the shell . One morning five weeks ago he saw a Mercedes limousine pull into the car park . He saw Admiral Rojas Milian get out of the car . The last time the President visited , he had been bedridden . He smiled a crafty Gallego smile , waiting for the Admiral on the chaise longue near the window . When Rojas came in , wearing his blue admiral 's uniform , he got up and went across the room quickly on his crutches . He supported himself on the brace of the left one and shook Rojas Millan 's hand . " Dios mio , " said the Admiral . " You are indestructible . " He shook his head , his jowls quivering . His face smiled . His dour eyes studied the Generalissimo . " I had a little vacation , " Francisco Franco said . Rojas waited for him to sit down . He did not sit . He gripped the crutch hard to keep his hand from trembling . " Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting . " " When , Excellency ? " " As soon as possible . Tomorrow . The day after . " That was the day his pride returned , really returned . The look of amazement in the Admiral 's eyes did it . In a little while it would go away again . The going away of his pride the second time would be worse . To be treated as a vegetable was one thing . To be taken for a fool was another . 64  | He met with the Cabinet once a week in the big , gloomy , wood-panelled Cabinet room downstairs . He structured his whole week around those meetings , studying memoranda , considering options , making decisions . The meetings were short . One hour , Dr. Caballero said . He worked thirty or forty hours preparing for that one hour , so it would be exactly the hour he wanted . He looked at the members of the Cabinet with new eyes . He had changed , and the change became apparent to him in his fresh evaluation of his subordinates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but an unfortunate one . He was not well liked . Even the Chief of Staff of the Army did not like him . He was a martinet to everyone except Franco , over whom he fawned . Eduardo Santo Domingo , the Director General of Security , was a good man . The shaven head made him look like a Prussian general , but the big dark liquid eyes did not lack compassion . Odd , but he had hardly noticed Santo Domingo before . He was a policeman , and he did his job , and that was that . It was more difficult to evaluate the Opus Dei faction . Laymen dedicated to God 's Work , whatever God 's Work was , and some even took vows of poverty and chastity . They were moderates , and conservatives called Opus Dei " God 's Octopus . " There were no liberals in the Cabinet . He supposed he had realized that before , but it had never seemed important . Where did you find a real liberal these days ? In the universities ? Men like Unamuno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had become timid and broken , had gone underground . What would he do with a liberal , anyway ? They wanted change , too much change too fast , and Spain was not ready . He could sense that the Cabinet was watching him , apprais-65  | ing him as he appraised them . His executive functions , suspended for so long , were now limited to one hour a week . They had the rest of the week to administer his decisions or pervert them . The Minister of Economics and Planning , an Opus Dei man , was the closest thing to a liberal in the Cabinet . Franco allotted him ten minutes at each session , and with proud dry technocratic expertise he reeled off facts . Until recently , he said , Spain exported raw materials , got manufactured goods in return . Living below the poverty level , that had been necessary . But Spain had risen above the poverty level . Per capita income exceeded a thousand dollars a year now . Now , he said , we export shoes , we export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sofia , Bulgaria . Shipbuilding ? We 're third in gross tonnage . Only Japan and Sweden sell more ships to the world . Foreign reserves ? Six billion dollars . Gross national product up eight percent last year . Have to watch the inflation , though . Twelve percent last year , and twelve the year before . The figures fascinated the Generalissimo . I did that , he would think . From a have-not nation to the third largest exporter of ships . How far can we go ? How far should I go ? A man changes and grows , or he stagnates . A country changes and grows , or it stagnates . That was what the Opus Dei man implied in his dry technocrat voice , and even the implication was enough to draw a sour look from the Admiral . The changes the Opus Dei man did not quite suggest had to be internal , but had to win approval outside the country . Perhaps Spain had been a pariah long enough . Relax the police state ? Franco wondered . Ease the censor-ship ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A nation of thirty million anarchists . He had one hour a week , and all the hours that went into 66  | that hour . And how many weeks ? lie had almost died . Another stroke would kill him . If the Opus Dei man 's ideas brought a sour look to Rojas Millan 's face , they brought an expression of tolerant contempt to the face of Jesus Quintana . Before his stroke , Franco had hardly noticed Quintana . A small , lean man with a mane of dark hair and a clipped mustache and a disconcerting way of looking at you , Quintana was second echelon , always sitting behind the Admiral 's shoulder , always passing scribbled notes like the other technocrats and experts who came to the Cabinet meetings . And yet there was a difference . Those rare times Rojas Millan broke his dour silence invariably followed the receipt of one of Quintana 's notes . Sitting at the long conference table , the President seemed hardly more than a puppet waiting to be manipulated by his deputy . In late April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjourned . " Quintana , " Franco said . " Quintana ? " " What does he do ? " " Detail work , " said the Admiral . " He has a remarkable memory , a logical mind . " " What else ? " " He keeps an eye on things for me . " " What kind of things ? " The Admiral waved a hand vaguely . " You know . Little things that may not seem important to the Public Order Police but could become critical , Excellency , when you ... " " When I die ? " The Admiral cleared his throat uncomfortably . " He has a small staff  --  fifty men , perhaps sixty . It 's not much of an operation . " The next question was obvious , and an obvious way of throw-67  | ing Rojas Millan off balance . It was there inside Francois head , waiting to be asked . But his mouth could not make the connection . He arranged his features pensively . The words stayed inside . The Admiral looked at him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all right again , and he said : " Since they appear to function as police , I assume they report to Colonel Santo Domingo ? " " They function  --  independently . They do n't belong under Security . " " Why not ? " Rojas Millan said nothing , as if the difficulty of speech was something they shared . " Do n't you trust Santo Domingo ? Tell me , as an old friend . " " That 's it , " the Admiral said eagerly . " I 'm the oldest friend you have , Excellency . We both want what 's best for Spain , after . .. " Another vague hand wave . " Say it . After I 'm dead . " " Well , you did give us a scare . But you 'll outlive us all , you 'll see , " the Admiral said with an anxious smile . Franco laughed . " Naturally . I 'll live forever . " " What I mean , " the Admiral said quickly , his dour eyes downcast , " is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jesus Quintana gathers information on potentially dissident elements inside the government . " " Then his small staff of fifty or sixty , would it be reasonable to call them spies ? " " I suppose it could be put that way . " It was warm in the conference room , and when the Admiral lifted his hand from the green baize of the table it left a damp print . Franco remained silent , knowing that desperation would fill the silence . " You 've had complaints ? From Santo Domingo ? Or some of the others ? Opus Dei does its own infiltrating , you know .  | God 's Octopus . They 're everywhere . Quintana 's a necessary countermeasure . You have to fight Communists with their own tactics . " " Communists ? They 're devout Catholics . " " Communists , " insisted the Admiral , " reds , anarchists , leftwing agitators , they 're all the same . " " And right-wing agitators ? " " I do n't understand , Excellency . " " Quintana wo n't curb dissidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Admiral Rojas Millan looked down at his fists , clenched on the green baize . " Yes , Excellency , " he said . Jesus Quintana did not appear at the next Cabinet meeting , or the one after that . One morning early in May , reading the monarchist newspaper ABC with his breakfast coffee as he always did , Franco was pleased to see a small article which said that Lieutenant Colonel Jesus Quintana , on detached duty as special assistant to the President , had been promoted to colonel and assigned the command of a small military base in the Asturias . Franco smiled . The coal miners of the north were troublemakers and would keep Jesus Quintana busy . Franco found more satisfaction in other items in ABC . In late April he had issued a directive to reopen the university , and the same edition of ABC that carried the news of Quintana 's promotion featured an article on University City . Schooling had returned to normal , the campus was quiet , the students had given up rioting in favor of education . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to France . He had flown to 69  | Paris on a fact-finding mission . The article did not put it that way , of course . It merely said that the Foreign Minister had gone to Paris to consult on matters of mutual interest to the two countries . Franco had sent him to explore the possibility of a closer tie with the EEC , even the eventuality of full membership should Spain agree to alleviate certain internal situations the French and particularly the Benelux nations found odious . The article in ABC , reading between the lines of the article , pleased Franco very much . The pleasure showed on his face when Carmen Polo de Franco joined him in the upstairs sitting room . It had become a morning routine , and Franco looked forward to it not merely for the company of his wife . Dona Carmen , small , gray-haired , stylishly dressed , was an active figure in Madrid . The Church approved of her . Her total acceptance of the One True Faith set a fine example for the people , and the Archbishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved of her , even if their approval sometimes cost them money . She had acquisitive instincts herself and owned controlling shares of several industrial corporations and department stores . The old grandees , Madrid 's high society , approved of her . She attended their galas and charity affairs and felt at ease with the ducal families of Alba , Medinaceli , and Salvatierra . The Army had grown to tolerate her . The technocrats of Opus Dei resented her . Her faith was old-fashioned and unquestioning , and she did not entirely approve of the young priests doing God 's Work on the streets of the poorer quarters of Madrid and Barcelona , since it was they and not the archbishop who determined the nature of God 's Work . Franco looked forward to his morning half hour with Dona Carmen because , in a way , she had become his eyes and ears . He was housebound , at Dr. Caballero 's orders . His world , for the time being , had been reduced to the Pardo Palace and its walled park . Carmen could , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the palaces of the grandees , along the spiderweb strands of the bureaucracy which , God and time willing , he would reduce in size . He came to depend more and more on Carmen for advice , knowing her advice was sound . His reliance on her disturbed Dona Carmen . " I do n't want to do this , " she would tell him . " It is n't right that I do this . " " Why ? " " I 'm only an old woman , I do n't understand these things , " she would evade the question . " I have no one else . " And she would say , with a strange , sad submission : " No , caro . You have no one else . But it does not please me , to do this . " The morning he read of Jesus Quintana 's appointment to the military base in the Asturias , she said : " You 're looking well , caro . " " I 'm feeling well . Did you see in the paper where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded quickly , not meeting his eyes . She stood at the window , sipping her coffee . " Today , " he said , " I think . The Foreign Minister . . . he 's been in Paris three days now . I want details . I have a feeling he 's making progress , real progress . " She turned away from the window . She looked at him for a long time . " No , " she said . He did not understand . He thought she was disputing his evaluation of the Foreign Minister 's mission . " I 'm going nowhere for you today , " she said . " We 've been all through that . I know you do n't like to . It wo n't be forever . Caballero says ? " " I know what Caballero says . " " In a few weeks I 'll be able to ? " Again she cut him off : " No . " " Carmen , " he said . " What is it ? " 71  | She turned away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it . " I brought you a visitor . " She crossed the sitting room to the inlaid rosewood desk and stood before the telephone console . She pressed a button but held her hand for several seconds on the cradled receiver before lifting it . " Send him up , " she said finally . She went to the window and stared out at nothing . In a little while there was a knock at the door and Carmen , her back still turned , called : " Please come in , Dr. Vega . " A young man with a round face and round glasses and the dry , earnest voice of someone totally competent within his small sphere of activity entered the room , bowed and said , as if Carmen had coached him : " You 're looking very well , Excellency . " Franco stood , using his aluminum canes . Vega . It was a name he should have known . But names troubled him these days . Sometimes he could not make the connection . " Dr. Vega , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Anselmo Vega was rector of the University of Madrid . An Opus Dei man ? He thought so , but was n't sure . " The Chief of State tires easily , " Carmen said in a flat voice . " You will have three minutes to present your case , Dr. Vega . " The dry , earnest voice used the three minutes competently , even brilliantly . Franco listened , at first not understanding , and then not willing to understand , and then hoping desperately that the shock of understanding did not show on his face , and then finally not caring . It was as if the roof of the Pardo Palace had fallen on him . He managed to mumble something encouraging . The round eyes behind the round glasses in the round face smiled at him . Anselmo Vega bowed again . Carmen ushered him to the door . " He wants , " Franco said , and stopped . The words would not come . The words would not and would not come . " He wants . " 72  | The brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak them . The body trembled . Carmen guided him to a leather chair . The cushion sighed under his weight . She hovered over him . " He wants me to open the university . " Carmen did not speak . " I do n't , " he said , and the words again eluded him . He stared up at her . " Newspaper , " he said . " Bedroom . " Carmen was gone . He waited through a small terrible segment of forever . Carmen returned with the newspaper . He held it and tried to open it . He wet his fingers , but that did not help . His hands were trembling too much . " It 's there , " Carmen said . " Happy students attending their classes at University City . You did n't imagine it . " She began to cry . The newspaper slid off his lap . " The university is still closed , " he said . " And Jesus Quintana still works for the Admiral , " she told him . " If I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister at his desk . " " But the newspaper . " " Special . Printed every day . For you . " He went deep inside himself and distantly heard her words . Once a week the Cabinet convened and let him play at being Chief of State . A deception , a small deception so that he might die in peace . Her words went away . She went away . He burrowed deeper into himself . Instead of Carmen he saw Dr. Caballero . He was surprised to find himself in bed . It was as if he had already been laid to rest in the Valley of the Fallen . 73  | The big , gray , swaybacked steers waited patiently while a ranch hand from the ganaderia , the bull-breeding ranch , of Concha y Sierra slid the bolt and opened the front compartment of the truck . At first there was nothing but the black opening in the side of the Pegaso truck and the ramp down which the bulls would come . It was a hot clear morning . A wind from the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the bulls would wait out the final days of their lives . The mayoral  --  the foreman of the ranch hands who had delivered the bulls to Puerto Real from the Concha y Sierra ranch south of Sevilla  --  climbed the ramp and swatted at the side of the opening with his flat-brimmed hat , then leaped down . 75  | A massive black head with wide , upward-curving horns appeared in the opening . The steers pawed the earth , their nostrils quivering . The bull came suddenly in a spurting slide down the wooden ramp , forelegs buckling at the bottom . Not as big as a Pablo Romero or a Miura , it was a compact , powerful beast with rage-crested tossing muscle and glossy black hide . " Much animal , " said Antonio Buenavista . Miguel Marquez nodded . " He 'll go five hundred kilos anyway . " Marquez would fight in the plaza along with Ricardo Diaz and Jose Carlos on Sunday , the last day of the fiesta . Two steers trotted into position and led the bull between the fences into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aligning the next compartment with the ramp , and a second bull emerged and slid down . The truck moved again , and a third bull came out . The steers led them off . The fourth bull scrambled very quickly away from the bottom of the ramp , hooking at air with his horns . Like confetti tossed into the wind , the two dozen men who had come to see the unloading scattered in all directions . The bull galloped downslope through an olive grove toward electrified barbed wire , two steers trotting in pursuit . The horns hooked at one of them , missing , and the second steer leaned its flank against the bull to calm him . As the first steer came back from the other side , the bull turned in his own length and hooked again , horns missing again in the bull 's eagerness , but the strength and weight of the upward tossing head was enough to throw the steer . Thrusting and hooking , the bull attacked , horns gouging deep furrows in the red earth . The fallen steer did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside the bull , and the bull lifted his head slowly , feeling the weight against him . A few moments later he went trotting off obediently between the steers . The final two bulls were conveyed to the corral without incident . Miguel Marquez smiled bleakly . " That one , " he said . " I 76  | would n't like to draw that one for Sunday . " Marquez was short and built squarely , his head squarish too with wide cheekbones and a wide jaw . The horns of the Concha y Sierra bulls , when he fought them , would reach almost to his armpits . Ricardo Diaz had watched the unloading in silence , feeling the skin of his face drawing tight . " The one that got away ? " Buenavista asked . " Sure , " Marquez said . " That bicho of a number 48 . " The number was branded on the bull 's glossy black flank . Buenavista considered . " I do n't know . It was an accident . I like the way he moved . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could fight a good faena with him , " Buenavista said . " He would charge straight , that one . " " That he charges Ricardo instead of me , " said Marquez in mock solemnity . " Or Jose Carlos . " Buenavista shrugged and then laughed , patting his broad belly . " Well , it 's certain he wo n't charge me . " " What do you think of them ? " Ricardo Diaz asked . He trusted Buenavista 's judgment . Buenavista probably knew more about the bulls than any man living . " Good , " said Buenavista . " A good lot . The number 15 might be manso . He might be cowardly , Ricardo . The way he pawed the ground at the bottom of the ramp . The 38 could have a bad left eye . He never even saw the steer moving in on him . The 15 and 38 you 'll have to watch . The 48 I like . You could win two ears and the tail with the 48 . " " Look , Antonio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Buenavista had spoken . " Would you fight on Sunday , as a favor to me ? " Buenavista smiled . He thought it was a joke . But then he looked at Diaz 's face and said : " With this belly ? My fighting days are over . " " I meant as Jose Carlos ' confidential banderillero. " 77  | " Man , I could n't plant the sticks . Too much beer . My legs are gone . " " Plant them any way at all . Just be there . You could help Jose Carlos . " " So could you . " " I will . You could help him more . " Buenavista looked at Diaz and then into the corral , where the Concha y Sierra bulls , calm and confident now that the unloading was over , stood patiently close together in the sunlight . All except the number 48 . The 48 stood at the fence , studying the men with a deadly interest . Buenavista scratched his grizzled head . " Well , " he said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fit this beer belly . " The mayoral of the Concha y Sierra ranch came over . He was a tall spare man , part gypsy , with hooded eyes and a tobacco-brown complexion . " Matador , " he said three times , ducking his head in a slight bow to each of the bullfighters . The word came out ma-a-aw in his thick Andalucian accent . " You like the bulls ? " They all agreed that they were very fine bulls . The mayoral rolled a cigarette with one hand . " Drinks , " he said . " To lay the dust . Courtesy of Concha y Sierra . " The two dozen men who had come to see the unloading , mostly nonprofessionals who had paid a small admission fee that would go to the bullfighters ' pension fund , gathered outside the barn behind the corral . A makeshift bar had been set up , two wide planks supported by brandy casks . One of the ranch hands served as bartender , dispensing brandy , manzanilla , and anis . On a cast-iron stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep olive oil . Ricardo Diaz had drunk his morning coffee and brandy a thousand times like this , with the heavy hot olive-oil-tasting fried batter of the churros , the sun warm on his back , the good 78  | cameraderie of the professionals and their expert talk about the hulls , the eager-to-be-there , anxious-to-please conversation of the aficionados , the feeling that this was the life he had wanted to live , and he had lived it . But now he drank but did not taste the brandy , he heard but did not heed the conversation , he spoke and it could have been someone else speaking . In five days it will be Sunday , he thought . Five successive days the bulls would die in the plaza de toros of Puerto Real , the customary Pablo Romeros to open the fiesta tomorrow , then Miuras on Thursday , for those foolish enough or desperate enough or down on their luck enough to enter the ring with the big , nervous , deadly bulls of Don Eduardo Miura , then on Friday the tame , pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday the bulls of his friend Diego Puerta , and finally on Sunday these Concha y Sierra bulls . And what else , on Sunday ? He had another brandy , feeling it in his throat smooth and mellow and this time tasting the good caramel taste of it . He would not let himself dwell on the problem of Sunday . Sunday was , Sunday must be , a lifetime away . Someone was talking to him in English . He saw the dark , black-Irish dark , handsome face of the man who had said Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway . " What 's the matter with that kid of yours , matador ? He should have been here , you know . " " For the unloading ? Some of us consider it bad luck . " " You do n't . Neither does Marquez . " Ricardo Diaz said nothing . " Did you find him last night ? " The question was asked with faintly anticipatory malice . " He was there . " " Well , glad to 've been helpful . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 79  | " He drank a lot , you know , at I larry 's Bar . That and hash is one lousy combination . I 'm telling you this for your own benefit . " " All right , " Ricardo Diaz said . He turned his back and walked past the corral to where he 'd parked the Ferrari . The Concha y Sierra number 48 , still at the fence , followed him with his eyes . The jets would arrive now , every half hour , at Malaga airport , and the buses and taxis and hired cars would bring the tourists along the coast road past Torremolinos and Fuengirola to Puerto Real . They would come from all over Spain , all over Europe , from as far away as San Francisco , California , which had its own Club Taurino that flew a chartered jet to Malaga every year for the fiesta . Some small number of the very rich would come in deepwater yachts to Banus ' moorings in Marbella . Ricardo Diaz was one of the reasons they came . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , the way they collected this year 's best-selling novelist or a new rock star who , they said for one season , could reach as high as Yma Sumac . The hippies , whatever they were called now , would come with guitars and bedrolls and air mattresses , and at night they would sleep on the beach or in the plaza near the old church . Fifty thousand people , all told , would descend on Puerto Real for the five-day fiesta . The plaza de toros , packed tight , could hold ten thousand spectators . Extra waiters and shoeshine boys by the hundreds would arrive from Madrid and Barcelona and Sevilla . Pickpockets would flourish . The traficos 80  | and armed police , reinforcements brought in from all over the province , would look the other way when they could . Prostitutes from Cannes and Nice would compete with the ready and willing Suecas , the blond casual lovers from northern Europe . There would be the predictable number of fights , the predictable number of knifings , the predictable quantity of pot and hash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up whole blocks of tickets and sold them at far more than the twenty percent markup the law allowed . Every night there would be fireworks , and there would be dancing in the streets and bad flamenco guitarists and worse flamenco singers , and later , before the dawn , the fiesta game of musical beds that would lead to the predictable number of broken marriages . A few , a very few of the fifty thousand visitors to Puerto Real , would actually know something about the bullfights . The man who had said Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway , would hold court every day at the Cafe Central under the orange trees across from the church , expounding at length on the deficiencies of this particular fiesta and the decadence of bullfighting in general . You should have seen Dominguin , he would say . You should have seen Ordoiiez in his prime . You should have seen that Mexican kid Arruza that got killed in a car crash . You should have seen Ricardo Diaz before the cynicism got to him . Ricardo Diaz , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generalissimo Franco . It was early afternoon , and the unloading of the Concha y Sierra bulls five hours behind him . It was early afternoon , and Sunday five hours closer . He walked with the crowd , alone in the crowd , tight-packed between the shopfronts , the sun hot overhead now , the mosaictile sidewalk littered , the cafes mobbed with tourists reading newspapers in a dozen languages . 81  | ? I 'm telling you , Sam , I saw it a hundred pesetas cheaper in Torremolinos , the crowd said . ? Cigarette butts on the floor and the seats , for crying out loud , I 'm gon na write a letter to Iberia , the crowd said . ? Je m'en fiche , the crowd said angrily . ? That pair of boobs on her , the crowd said . ? Ven aca , ven aca , the crowd said anxiously . Donde esta to hermana ? ? I 'm telling you , they always call him the Chief of State in the papers , I can read Spanish , he 'll be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes , the crowd said . ? Liebling , du soli-test ihn nicht glauben ! the crowd said . ? Is n't that Ricardo Diaz ? I swear it 's Ricardo Diaz , the crowd said . ? No , he 's too young . Diaz is an older man . ? I still think , the crowd said . ? And poor dear Bertie went down three times before he stayed down . Later we learned the other fellow was middleweight champion of , the crowd said . " Hello , Ricky , " the crowd said . He saw Kate Cameron seated alone at a front row table of the Cafe Central . She was wearing a large straw sunhat , and dark glasses hid her blue eyes . She folded a copy of yesterday 's International Herald Tribune . She brushed at a strand of her long wheat-blond hair that had escaped the hat and said : " You never know who you 're going to run into in Puerto Real on a Tuesday afternoon . " He found a chair and brought it over to the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlos Primero , and put it back in one swallow and ordered another before the waiter left with the bottle . " It 's good to see you , Kate , " he said , and meant it . " Then smile ? Just a little bit ? I thought Scots were dour . " 82  | " It 's one of those days . " " Bulls come ? " " Right on schedule . " " Well ? " " ' They 're bulls . Jose Carlos ought to do all right . " " I was thinking about you . It 's been four years , Rick . " " Diego 's bringing some three-year-olds over to the ranch . I 'll be okay . " " Richard and Elizabeth got in last night , " Kate said . " ' They 're together again . I tried to get in touch with you . We 're having lunch at the Hacienda . Join us ? " " I do n't think so , Kate . " " Wait a minute , let me finish . They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could you imagine a better Goya than Richard or a better Duchess of Alba than Elizabeth ? " Kate leaned forward . " Remember Around the World in Eighty Days , when Dominguin did those bullfighting sequences ? " " Luis Miguel was pretty damn good , " he said . " Why ? " " There 's a supporting role for a bullfighter in this Goya script , and I mentioned you . They 're interested . " " I guess I 'm not . " " They 'll be on location right here in Spain . Why do n't you at least think about it ? " " Kate , I 'm not broke yet . " " I did n't mean it that way . It 's just that you , well , since you are at loose ends , I thought . . . " " Oiga , " he called , and the waiter came with the bottle again . " When do they start filming ? " he asked Kate . " Late next month . In Madrid and Sanlucar and Zaragoza . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do it , wo n't you ? You 'll really do it . " " I 'll have lunch with them . I 'll think about it . " 83  | " There 's a part for me , too . Sort of a cameo but a good one . Would n't it be fun working together ? " " What kind of part ? " he asked , surprised . Kate Cameron did not take small roles . She removed her sunglasses and looked at him . " The bullfighter 's mistress . Maybe they could change the script . Maybe he could make an honest woman of her . " The food at the Hacienda , which stood on a hill less than two miles from Rancho Andaluz , was superb . The maitre d ' knew Ricardo Diaz and Kate Cameron , and of course he recognized Richard and Elizabeth . They had a table in an alcove with a window that looked along a lane of umbrella pines to the sea . The maitre d ' insisted on ordering for them . They had coquinas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small succulent leg of milk-fed lamb each , and a salad with aged manchego cheese . They drank a bottle of Martinez Lacuesta and two of Riscal . Richard used his deep voice persuasively . They had n't really done a big one , he said , since The Borgias . Really big , with the sweep of a Lawrence of Arabia or a Dr. Zhivago . The Goya script was just right . It had everything  --  the alienated artist , the court intrigues , the country in revolution , the Napoleonic invasion . They 'd try to bring it in at twenty million , but twentyfive would n't give the backers apoplexy . " Who 's the bullfighter ? " Ricardo Diaz asked . " Pepe Hillo , " Richard told him . " Hillo ? He 'd turn over in his grave if he knew I was going to play him . " 84  | " The hell he would , " said Elizabeth , with the sort of smile that almost , but not quite , overshadowed Kate 's . " Look , " Richard said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madrid next week . You come through and the part 's yours . You do n't , and you could still do the bullfighting sequences . " " He 'll come through , " Elizabeth said . " He 's beautiful . Is n't he beautiful , Kate ? " " There 's a pretty good death scene in there , you know , " Richard said . " Hillo was killed by a bull . " 85  | The Moorish watchtowers were strung along the coast from north of Valencia all the way to Gibraltar like beads on the Mediterranean necklace of Spain . A thousand years ago a signal fire could be lit on Jebel Tariq , and another one up the line , and another , and in a few short hours the Moorish garrisons could be alerted and the caliph in Cordoba or Granada ready for trouble . It was as good an early-warning system as any devised until the advent of electricity , and the Moors had made good use of it . Now most of the watchtowers along the rugged coast had crumbled into ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summered in one near Alicante . An abstract painter from Belgium married a Spanish heiress who bought 87  | him one on the coast south of Granada , and he used it for a studio . The old noble family of Salvatierra had restored the big Puerto Real watchtower and incorporated it into their estate . It stood on a promontory over the sea , and from it the grounds of the estate fanned inland toward the highway . There was a high stone fence with barbed wire on top where the wide frontage of the property dropped to the vega on the seaward side of the road . A crushed-shell driveway climbed from the massive gates and past the gatehouse between rows of dusty eucalyptus trees . The gatehouse itself would have satisfied most people 's dream of a castle in Spain , but beyond it in a date palm and jacaranda park stood the mansion itself , the roof of blue tile , the windows and doors blue-tile trimmed , the building stone quarried and cut to match the watchtower itself . There were fifty rooms in the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A swimming pool , a row of cabanas , two clay tennis courts , and stables dotted the property . A flight of stone steps climbed steeply from the pool area to the watchtower itself , where the resident Salvatierra , Don Alfonso , cousin of the exiled Duchess Maria Teresa , kept under lock and key the collection of whips and high leather boots and eighteenth century feminine costumes necessary for the sexual stimulation of the boys and jaded women , always foreigners , who visited him , and of Don Alfonso himself . Don Alfonso , crisply turned out in white Lacoste shorts and shirt , was playing tennis with a tall young woman named Miss Kitchen . Don Alfonso was a handsome man of thirty with the sloping shoulders and flat smooth muscles of a gentleman athlete . Miss Kitchen , who would be catching the seven o'clock BEA Trident from Malaga to London , could not match Don Alfonso 's skill at tennis , and he was now in the process of demolishing her in straight sets . Miss Kitchen had been some-88  | thing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the partner-switching car clubs in Paris and the audience-participation circuses in London , she had been , with no coaxing from I ) on Alfonso , magnificent . He had worn his Marie Antoinette costume with its frills and ruffles and she the high black boots . For a while she had stood , whip in hand , watching him undress , and then she had flung the whip aside and said , " You silly man , you 're all thumbs , " and undressed him herself . Then , looking quite demure through it all , she had , with an expertise learned in the London circuses , used her fingertips on nerve endings at the back of his neck , under his arms , and in his groin , reducing him swiftly to a state of ecstatic pain before they coupled . Her talents were amazing , and he would invite her back to Castillo del Moro , paying her way from London any time she wanted him . He wanted her again already , but there was the guest he expected any minute now . " Match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent an ace whistling past Miss Kitchen 's tardy backhand swing . They changed into bathing suits , they swam in the pool , they showered and dressed and were sipping orange juice and sherry over crushed ice at the poolside verandah when Jesus Quintana arrived . Handsome , inbred , effete , and , except for the location of his estate , Quintana decided after the first five minutes , quite useless . But the estate was a fortress and Don Alfonso de Salvatierra was only too glad to turn it over , for a few days , to the government . Ingratiating himself with the government by moving into one of the guesthouses and opening his gates to 89  | a small army of security people was the least Don Alfonso could do , and he was eager to do it . He could even dare hope that in time the government might take the title from his exiled cousin and confer it on him . In rare instances such things had happened before . Quintana knew that , and knew that Don Alfonso knew it , and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title would not benefit from being conferred on this inbred aristocrat and , probably , they would let La Quijota keep it . " A security force of a hundred men , " Quintana said . " You have room ? " " No problem , Colonel . " " We 'll want to block the stairs going down from the cliff to the beach , and install floodlights . Is there another way up ? " " Not unless you happen to be a rock climber . " Don Alfonso smiled . " Could a helicopter land here ? " " You are taking precautions , Colonel . " The polished urbane effeteness of the man made him seem even more unreal than most , a clever mannequin set on earth for Jesus Quintana 's amusement . " I 'm not worried about a helicopter landing here . I want one to . " " The Generalissimo 's coming by helicopter ? " " We could remove the fence between the tennis courts , " Quintana said . " No problem , Colonel . " " And give your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Who 's the woman ? " " Miss Kitchen ? " Miss Kitchen had retired to one of the guest cottages . " A friend . " " Get her out of here . " " She 's leaving on the seven o'clock for London . " 90  | " Your cousin in Paris ? " said Quintana . " Yes , that 's right . The duchess is in Paris . " " You do n't know that . I did n't say that . " The mannequin 's left eyelid twitched . " Your cousin rented a small apartment on the rue des Quatre-Vents in the septieme . It has not been occupied since last Thursday . " " We have family friends , " Don Alfonso said . " In the Charente , in the Tarn , on the Cote d'Azur . " " We know that , " Quintana said . " She could be anywhere in France . Or in England . In England we have ? " - " The duchess left Paris for Narbonne last Friday in a private plane owned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , the flight was logged to Narbonne . She piloted herself . The plane did not land there . We have reason to believe your cousin is in Spain . " The mannequin 's left eyelid twitched again . " Dear me , " Don Alfonso said . " Her return at this time , " Quintana said dryly , " is a coincidence . She could have had no knowledge of the Chief of State 's pending visit to Puerto Real . Nevertheless , Maria Teresa de Salvatierra is a rallying point for certain dissident elements , particularly among the university students and the young priesthood , as you 're aware . Has she contacted you ? " " Of course not ! " Don Alfonso cried indignantly . " We are aware , " Quintana said smoothly , " that no love is lost between you and the duchess . Still , Castillo del Moro is her home . " " She 'd be insane to come here . " " Who knows what she 'll do ? She 's unpredictable . We want no  --  unseemly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be disposed most favorably toward anyone informing us of the duchess ' whereabouts . Most favorably , Don Alfonso . " 91  | Don Alfonso 's teeth gleamed white against the tan of his face . " If I learn anything , you 'll hear of it immediately , Colonel . " The two men spent an hour exploring the grounds of Castillo del Moro . Quintana asked questions , jotted notes in a small leather-covered notebook . Castillo del Moro , he congratulated himself , had been a fine choice . It Quintana had done his job , and remember . Quintana would also visit the Civil Guard commandant in Puerto Real , and his thoroughness would again be evident . He would confer with the commander of the army base south of Malaga airport . There too he would leave the memory of his thoroughness . He would dine with the director of Radio Peninsular at the station between the Golf Parador and the army base , to discuss setting up a communications center . The same meticulous attention to detail would leave the same memory of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zeal . Jesus Quintana was a man who knew his work , and who cared . Like the rest of Spain on Sunday , he would be numb with shock and grief when the unforeseeable happened . Thorough security measures , meticulously planned and admirably executed , could protect the Chief of State from an organized attempt against his life . They could not protect him from the impulsive act of a half-crazed assassin . " I was beginning to think you did n't live here any more , " the woman said . Barefoot , wearing white duck bell-bottoms and a crimson 92  | blouse , she was perched on the desk in the library of Rancho Andaluz . Glossy black braids hung down over her full breasts and she sat hunched forward with her legs crossed Indian style . I ler face was heart-shaped , with a small nose and short upper lip that left her mouth parted slightly in repose , giving her an expectant , and expectantly sensuous , look . There was a dolllike quality to her , accentuated by the way she sat hunched over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her head would barely reach Ricardo Diaz 's shoulder . She was thirty-two years old and looked ten years younger . " What the hell are you doing here ? " Diaz asked . She held the book out for his inspection and then tossed it across the room , where it landed , pages fanning , on an easy chair . " Reading Unamuno 's The Tragic Sense of Life , " she said . " Like most Spaniards , Unamuno alternates between taking himself too seriously and not seriously enough . Which is more than you can say for the French , or maybe less . " She spoke , as she always did , in a breathless rush of words , as if she had to clear her mind of one idea before plunging on to the next . Diaz strode to the desk , grasped her arm and yanked her to her feet . She looked up at his face . " Are you going to sock me or kiss me ? " Her eyes bothered him . They always had . Cats had eyes like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful mocking savagery . " I asked , what the hell are you doing here ? " " In general ? Or specifically ? In Spain or at Rancho Andaluz ? I got a little tired of Paris . The Left Bank , with all the sidewalk cafes full of sidewalk cafe existentialists . Mais oui , mademoiselle , one must make a leap from despair to a commitment to the unknowable . One can make this leap most easily by leaping into my bed , mademoiselle . I was propositioned three hundred 93  | and twenty-seven times , philosophically of course , on the Boulevard St.-Germain and in the Luxembourg Gardens . I 'm starving , and I need a bath . " " Who knows you 're here ? " " Only the cook . Conchita ? " " You ca n't stay here , " Ricardo Diaz said . " You were crazy to come back . " She went to the window . The last blue light of dusk looked in through the glass . " Then I 'll leave , " she said gravely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm Marie Pongerville from Clermont-Ferrand , nothing to eat , nowhere to go , a price on my head ... . Can I take the Unamuno ? Times like that , there 's nothing like a good book . " There was a soft knock at the door . Conchita , fat and smiling and bearing a tray , came into the room . She dropped the smile when she saw Ricardo Diaz . " It 's all right , Conchita , " he said . " You are a good man , Don Ricardo , " Conchita told him . Maria Teresa nodded . " I always said if you have to work for the rich , pick a man who grew up in poverty . " Conchita did not know whether she was supposed to smile . She smiled tentatively and busied herself at the desk , placing a linen napkin and silverware on a straw placemat . " Gazpacho and a grilled swordfish steak , Dona Maria Teresa , " she said . " As you were in a hurry . " Conchita bowed and left . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maria Teresa said . " Could n't you see her exhorting handsome coal miners and stalwart truck drivers and clear-eyed peasants , like La Pasionaria in Madrid ? If Conchita joined , she 'd get card number two . You could have number three , Ricardo . " " You were n't even born when La Pasionaria left Spain . " " And you were what , three years old ? Two ? She 's still  | around , you know , in Russia somewhere , last anybody heard . ' That 's her mistake . I mean going there . If you ever have to choose between fascism and communism , better settle for fascism . The power-to-the-people types are dangerous fanatics . Are you still fanatically in love with me , Ricardo ? " " 1 ) o yourself a favor and get out of here . " " Myself a favor ? " Ricardo Diaz shrugged wearily . He knew she would n't leave , and knew he would n't throw her out . She turned , the braids swinging , and as much as they ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave . " I 'll say this fast , Ricardo . Or I 'll try . About Al . " I le remembered her sitting on the ground at University City , Alberto 's smashed head on her lap , crying . " You do n't have to say anything . " " Maybe you do n't have to listen . But I have to say it . I have n't had a real night 's sleep since then , not once . I dream about it . If I could do anything to bring him back , including dying in his place , I 'd do it . I swear I would . " " All right . It 's done . Leave it alone . " " You blame me for what happened . " " I do n't blame anyone . Go on and eat . " He lit a 1X2 and inhaled the smoke of the harsh tobacco while he watched her eat . She became totally engrossed in the bowl of gazpacho , the swordfish steak and the jar of white wine . It was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , attending to its necessities with an animal 's directness . She patted her lips with the napkin and sighed . " How long will you stay ? " " I need a rest . I need to sort things out . " " Then what ? " " Then I do n't know . I guess I was a pretty effective agitator before they exiled me . Rich duchess believes in democracy , if 95  | not worse . But now I 'd have to stay in hiding , and I just do n't know . There 's a priest I have to see , in Malaga , for starters . Young . Pink-faced and scrubbed-looking like a schoolboy , but he 's ready to kick his bishop in the ass . They 'll come from inside , you know . The changes . They 'll have to . Now about that bath . Six layers of French grime and three of Spanish . Then I 'd like to sleep about twenty-four hours , with an occasional interruption not only permitted but encouraged , muy senor mb . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , flinging her arms around his neck in an exaggerated gesture of a passion that was nevertheless real . " Give me half an hour for that bath , " she said against his mouth . " Well , make it fifteen minutes . Those French , they 're pretty lousy lovers . Yammer , yammer , yammer , all the time . " He laughed and , doing it , realized he had n't in days .  | Sitting near the window of Carmen 's bedroom in the Pardo Palace , the old man could hear the sounds of activity downstairs : footsteps going back and forth , voices , the occasional ringing of a telephone . He was dressed for outdoors , in a khaki uniform that had been taken in here and there to fit him despite his loss of weight . The helicopter had n't arrived yet . Through the window Francisco Franco saw half a dozen air force noncoms in the car park . The sky was clear . It would be a good day for the flight to Puerto Real . Admiral Rojas Millan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ago . " There 's talk , " he had said . " There was bound to be . You have n't made a public appearance since your illness . We think it would be beneficial if you did . " 97  | The day before , he had been given a thorough examination by Dr. Caballero . " We ? " he asked the Admiral . " The Cabinet . " " Why was n't I consulted ? " " We did n't want to disappoint you . There was the necessity of the physical examination first . Dr. Caballero is very pleased with your vital signs . " Vital signs , he thought now , waiting for the helicopter . What an odd way of putting it . That the stubborn heart pumps sufficient blood . That the bellows of the lungs bring enough oxygen into the bloodstream . That the viscera function properly . That the wires taped to greased spots on the temples record adequate electric activity in the brain . There had been no talk of vital signs before another trip , by air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a public appearance . Far from it . Three generals had waited in Spain to rise against the crumbling government of Prime Minister Casares Quiroga . Sanjurjo , Goded , Mola , his fellow-conspirators  --  it was so long ago he hardly remembered what they looked like . Two of them dying in the first months of the revolution . Sanjurjo taking off in an overloaded ancient biplane and crashing . Goded executed by a Republican firing squad in Barcelona . Mola sharing the convictions of the others but not their ambition . That left Francisco Franco , youngest general in the Spanish Army . A national hero after he had put down the rising of the Rifs in Morocco , he had been exiled by Casares Quiroga to the command of an insignificant garrison in the Canary Islands . That meant Sanjurjo , Goded and Mola would have to wait . No one could overthrow the government in Madrid without the Foreign Legion and the Army of Africa , and neither Sanjurjo nor Goded nor Mola commanded their loyalty . 98  | It was ironic that , in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elude the government patrols ; ironic that no Spanish pilot could be trusted to attempt the mission . The plane was French , the pilot an Englishman named Bebb with a big insolent mustache and laughing eyes . Plane and pilot had been recruited by the London correspondent of the monarchist newspaper ABC , and ever since ABC was the newspaper Francisco Franco read . A Dragon Rapide , the plane could fly faster than any then used by the Spanish Air Force . It left London with a few British passengers as window-dressing and refueled in Lisbon . Captain Bebb lacked a flight plan and the necessary papers . He had charm , Franco remembered , and he must have used it on the Portuguese officials . The twin-engined biplane refueled and took off for Las Palmas in the Canary Islands . Francisco Franco had come by ferry to Las Palmas from the out-island garrison . The plane took off , and the window-dressing passengers and Captain Bebb gaped while the new passenger opened a briefcase and changed his khaki uniform for Arab robes and turban . The Dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window-dressing passengers would have a well-earned holiday . The final leg of the Dragon Rapide 's flight was Casablanca to Spanish Morocco . Captain Bebb , shortly before landing in Tetuan , saw the pudgy , high-voiced Spaniard again open his briefcase . He pulled out the rumpled khaki uniform . In a few minutes he was a soldier again . " What are you , " Bebb asked , " some kind of a bloody quickchange artist ? " Franco understood the pilot 's English , but was unaccustomed to speaking it . He replied in French : " I am General Franco . " They soared low over the minarets of Tetuan and landed at 99  | the military airport , where units of the Foreign Legion and the Army of Africa waited . The revolution began that day . At least this uniform is pressed , Franco thought now in the Pardo Palace in Madrid . He supposed he ought to wear some medals . He did not know why the Admiral had proposed the trip to Puerto Real . His reasons were convincing only up to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , " he had said . " But even a sick man could make a brief show of himself . It would prove nothing . " " I am a sick man . " " You 're getting better every day , Excellency . " Rojas Millan rarely called him Excellency . Usually it meant the Admiral was unsure of his ground . " But the people do n't know that . Tell me , have you ever missed the fiesta in Puerto Real ? " Like the Cruz Roja in Madrid , the Puerto Real bullfights were a charity affair . The bullfighters took nothing for their work . Even the impresario of the plaza de toros donated the gate receipts to half a dozen charities approved and sponsored by the Senora de Franco . " I missed them once or twice . " " Almost never , Excellency , in thirty years . If you go now , the talk of your  --  incapacity to govern will be only that , talk . " The timing , quite accidentally , had been perfect . Had the Admiral suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused . He might have said , have the decency to let me die in peace . Quintana still whispering in the Admiral 's ear , Paris unvisited by the Foreign Minister , University City a pile of red brick buildings standing empty on the hill over the Manzanares River . The awareness of the deception had almost destroyed him . He had stopped caring and , he supposed , Caballero then  | would have had a different report to make on his vital signs . But he began to think . Very well , he told himself . They are deceiving you . They might have gone on deceiving you in whatever months or weeks or days you had left . Or worse . If they knew you were aware of the deception , they could keep you a prisoner in the Pardo Palace , the jailer Dr. Caballero , the bars his prescribed medicine and bed rest . But they do not know . You have a little strength and , probably , a little time left . You must husband the first , use the second . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only you can make them . He wondered if the conspirators , almost forty years ago , would have sent Captain Bebb in the Dragon Rapide if they knew what he was thinking now . That the cloying , suffocating scent of Africa no longer belonged in Spain . That Spain was European . That Spain 's destiny waited in the north , across the Pyrenees . That decisions would be made in Paris and London and Amsterdam on the basis of what happened in Madrid , and that those decisions would affect Spain in a way that the Admiral did not , and never would , understand . He began caring again . He even began to be amused . If they could deceive him , he could deceive them . Unwittingly , they had unlocked the prison door . The government would not pack bag and baggage and move en masse to Puerto Real , the way it moved to San Sebastian for the summer . The many-tentacled bureaucracy would remain behind . But important elements of the aristocracy , of the business community , of the intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the younger priesthood  --  all would be in Puerto Real for the fiesta . He could reach them there as he could not in his sickroom here in the Pardo Palace . 101  | He could sound them out . He could . . . He did not know exactly what , any more than he knew why Rojas Millan and the others really wanted him to visit Puerto Real . The abrupt hammer blow of the stroke , the closeness of death , the weeks of being unable to talk or even think in a straight line , the memory of incense and the hand of the Archbishop of Toledo touching him with the cautionary oil of extreme unction  --  all that had changed him in ways he did not fully understand . He heard a roaring , beating sound . He looked out the window . Like an ungainly bird , the helicopter settled to the ground . The former Civil Guard Pedro Ramirez lived with his son 's family in the village of San Julian . It was n't much of a village , the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bare earth between them , brown and black goats foraging in refuse piles in the ditches . San Julian 's working population spent long hours in the laundry that took in work from the big hotels in Torremolinos a few miles away , or cut sugarcane , or earned their pesetas at the Coca-Cola bottling plant or across the road at the San Miguel brewery . A few of them , including the former Civil Guard Pedro Ramirez 's son , were employed in the subdevelopment that lay at the edge of the sea beyond the fields of sugarcane . Ramirez 's son was a plumber at the subdevelopment , working for the rich Madrilenos , Americans and Filipinos who lived behind their brick walls in the big villas there . Every afternoon after his siesta Pedro Ramirez would walk along the dirt track past the high cane rustling in the breeze  | to the subdevelopment gate . The gateman was from San Julian and of Pedro Ramirez 's generation . Sometimes Ramirez thought he should have found such employment himself , but he had decided he could help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was paid to run errands , like that past Sunday when he had visited the great bullfighter Ricardo Diaz in Puerto Real . Occasionally he watched the children while his son and daughter-in-law visited her family up in Granada . At such times he felt useful . Better yet was the boat . He left it on the beach between the subdevelopment and the first distant high-rise buildings of Torremolinos . He had a kerosene lantern for the boat , and at dusk a few hundred yards off shore the fish would rise to its light . There was no telling what his net might catch . Sardines , boquerones , salmonete , sometimes a large , sweet-fleshed merluza . Going out with the boat , pulling at the oars and feeling the good looseness in the muscles of his back , watching the dusk drop on the sea , lighting the lantern and casting the net , became the big part of Pedro Ramirez 's day . He went whenever the weather permitted , unless his son had gone to Granada . Whenever the weather permitted , in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lantern , he greeted the gateman with a cheerful " Hola , Paco , " and they chatted a while before Pedro Ramirez went along the paved road past the rarity of apartment houses built on stilts . The gateman Paco had told him the apartment houses on stilts had been designed by a Filipino , and ever since Pedro Ramirez thought of the Philippine Islands as a rare place , like a planet he would never see . But he had some knowledge of it , and that pleased him : He knew they built their houses on stilts . Ramirez went past the Filipino buildings and skirted the large parking lot of the Holiday Inn . A stiff onshore breeze blew the flags of many nations out stiffly above cars that were all 103  | gleaming chromium and steel . Ramirez wondered for a moment about the people unseen in the lighted windows of the Holiday Inn . He was both amused and pleased that they had come to his tierra for their vacations , although he did not know quite why they had come . Then Ramirez smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was striding along the sand in the dusk . It was the only stretch of empty beach left between the bay of Malaga and the buildings that had spread out northeast from Torremolinos , and Ramirez liked to walk there . He could almost imagine it like the old days , when gypsies lived in the caves carved out of the soft rock that rose behind the beach . The gypsies were gone now . Perhaps they forgot they were gypsies and worked in the big hotels in Torremolinos . Ramirez passed a few other fishing skiffs that belonged to friends of his in San Julian , and then he saw his own boat , beached above the high water mark . It would take Ramirez fifteen minutes to drag the boat across the sand and into the sighing tide . It was hard work , and sometimes his friends who owned the other boats helped him , but they did n't come every day . Ramirez saw the figure of a man silhouetted near the high prow of the boat against the last glow of the twilight . Good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiff down to the water alone after all . " Are you Sr. Ramirez ? " the man asked . He spoke with the lisping accent of Madrid . " I am Pedro Ramirez , yes . " " The former Civil Guard ? " " Yes , senor . " The Madrileno was no man Ramirez knew . " My name is Lopez . I 'm a friend of your friend the Civil Guard sergeant Juan Alvarez . " " I did not know Juan had friends in Madrid . " Juan Alvarez 104  | had given Ramirez the envelope for the bullfighter Ricardo Diaz . " I 'm vacationing at the Holiday Inn , " Lopez said . " Juan told me about you , Sr. Ramirez . " Ramirez had a patient mind and a slow way of speaking . " Told you what about me ? " " That you went fishing most evenings . That this boat is yours . " " That 's true , " said Ramirez . " Juan thought you would n't mind if I went with you . What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's in the boat . This lantern attracts the fish . Is it true that you wish to join me ? " It was a rare thing for a Madrileno , almost as rare as the Filipino buildings on stilts . " I 'll pay you for the pleasure , senor . " Pedro Ramirez shook his head . " Senor , how could I accept the money of a friend of Juan Alvarez ? Come , help me drag this monster of a boat into the sea . That 's payment enough . " Ramirez had beached the skiff on logs at right angles to its keel . It was easy getting the boat as far as the wet sand of the high water mark by removing the logs in back and then placing them in front , and difficult after that . The two men struggled , the skiff 's keel gouging a furrow in the wet sand . " You 're strong , " said Ramirez . " I do n't have your years , viejo , " Lopez told him . Ramirez liked the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat , and he bent his back as much as any of Ramirez 's friends would have done . They rolled up their pants and tossed their shoes into the skiff . Soon it had buoyancy . It bobbed in the gentle surf . " Come aboard , senor , " Ramirez said formally , and the Madrileno awkwardly climbed into the boat . 105  | Ramirez rowed for fifteen minutes straight out to sea . Lopez sat in the stern , silhouetted against the lights of the Holiday Inn . When he decided they had gone far enough , Ramirez removed the oars from the tholes . " What do we do now ? " Lopez asked . " The lantern . The net . And then we row back . It is very simple , senor . " Ramirez lit the kerosene lantern . He set it on the thwart in the prow of the skiff and stood to cast the net . It hissed into the water , sinking quickly through the glow cast by the lantern . " Can I help ? " Lopez asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'd like to . " They sat side by side and began to row . They rowed for three minutes back toward the beach . " What will we catch ? " Lopez asked . " Ah , who knows , senor ? " Pedro Ramirez said . " A monster of a whale , perhaps , " he laughed , and those were the last words he ever spoke . He felt a quick movement to his left , and was aware that Lopez had half risen from the thwart . Something , he realized it was Lopez 's elbow , hit his face , and then something else , he did not realize it was Lopez 's hip , thrust hard against him , and suddenly he was up and over the gunwale and in the water . He coughed and looked up at Lopez . He treaded water and grasped the gunwale . Lopez , standing , the skiff swaying , kicked at his hands , and he let go . Lopez kneeled and pushed down hard against his shoulders . Ramirez went under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under and struggled and came up again . He tried to turn his head and bite Lopez 's hand . He could not . He went under again and thought of his son and his daughter-in-law and the grandchildren waiting in San Julian .  | He came up once more , but he was weak then . The hands pushed . Ile went down and saw the lantern light and tried to tight his way back up to it . He saw Ricardo Diaz signing the tattered copy of El Ruedo , the proudest moment of his life , and he saw his son coming home past the tall sugarcane , and he saw the rare buildings on stilts , and then convulsively he breathed , he could not help it , but what he breathed was salt water , and he had time enough to wonder , knowing he would never learn the answer , why the man from Madrid had wanted to kill him . Jesus Quintana sat alone in the skiff . Even if no one used the oars , the onshore breeze and the rising tide would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not have to swim . He could row toward the lights of the Holiday Inn and let the skiff beach itself . Later that night the tide would wash away his footprints in the wet sand . He felt mild satisfaction in the killing of Pedro Ramirez , like the satisfaction he might feel waking in the night to the whine of a mosquito and with one swat of his palm killing it and going back to sleep knowing he would n't be bothered . Ramirez had been a loose end . The danger of letting him live would have been minimal , but Quintana believed in caution . It was almost like the meeting six months ago to decide how to eliminate the Caudillo . They had all agreed on the necessity , but none of them was willing to do the job himself and it was finally determined that was a good thing . It was also determined that whoever did the job should be caught doing it , killed doing it , and certainly none of them saw himself in that role . 107  | Quintana had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to hurry . The others were less certain about the need to kill Franco than he was . Six months ago the changes in the Caudillo had been more apparent to Quintana than to the others : The total downgrading of the Falange , the increasing favor in which the old man held the Opus Dei faction , his growing interest in the plans of the moderate technocrats . Someone , Quintana had thought , with no political ax to grind . Someone with a grudge . Someone capable of performing the act and then forced to perform it . He had been surprisingly easy to find , which was another way of saying that things came easily to Jesus Quintana . But , by almost dying , Franco perversely took it away from them . It was only a matter of days , and then of weeks . Dr. Caballero made tests and administered therapy , and the old man shocked them all with his recovery . It was only a partial recovery , but the brush with death had accelerated the changes in Franco . A political liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old age . The reverse was no common thing , but Franco had always been unpredictable . It satisfied the others that Franco should live a few more months , duped into believing he still ruled Spain . They would merely bide their time . It did not satisfy Jesus Quintana . Finally his will had prevailed . Someone suggested Dr. Caballero . It would be simple for Caballero to hold a pillow over the old man 's face while he slept . Franco was weak . His struggles would be minimal and an autopsy would show only that he had died in his sleep of natural causes . But still , they had all vetoed the idea of Caballero . The important thing was that nobody associated with the cabal perform the act . Caballero had seemed relieved . The others believed the succession would come about as Franco had ordained , with the vacuous Juan Carlos as Chief 108  | of State and the unpopular Admiral as head of government . It would , for a time . But Jesus Quintana was a student of history , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Naguib . The Admiral was a cautious man , in some ways even more cautious than Quintana . His caution could have been a problem , had he been aware of the plot to assassinate the Caudillo . Quintana and the others had not made him aware of it . But they knew that the Admiral , presented with the gift of Franco 's death and his own rise to power , would check the increasing influence of Opus Dei and the technocrats . Quintana himself knew more than that . In a year , or two , or five  --  he was only a little older than Nasser had been when the Egyptian army deposed King Farouk  --  he would emerge from the shadows . Spain needed a strongman , and there was none stronger than Jesus Quintana . His patient infiltration of the bureaucracy on behalf of the Admiral would guarantee his ultimate rise to power . The dossiers he had compiled on the others would make them pull their forelocks in obedient peasant servility . Quintana went forward on his knees to the kerosene lantern and extinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtful look on his face . The skiff would be found , or it would go out on the next tide . Ramirez 's body would wash up on shore or sink or be swept out to sea . An old man goes fishing alone . There is an unfortunate accident . His heart , or even an attack of vertigo . There would be no investigation , and no way to link the death to Jesus Quintana . Even the others , settling in now at Castillo del Moro in Puerto Real , knew that Quintana had two meetings , the first at the Malaga army garrison , the second at Radio Peninsular . He had already seen the general . He had left a change of clothes in his rented car in the Holiday Inn parking lot . He would change ; he would see the radio director and drive back with 109  | him to Puerto Real , half an hour late perhaps . In Spain that was not late at all . Quintana pulled on the oars . The dragging of the net made the work more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final catch of Pedro Ramirez 's life had been a good one . 110  | On Wednesday afternoon Ricardo Diaz stood in the callejon , the narrow passageway between the two red wooden fences of the Puerto Real bullring , and watched the corrida . Angel Teruel was fighting as senior matador , Teruel who could use the big percale cape with a heartstopping slowness if he approved of the bull , and who could kill beautifully , thanks to his height and long arms , but who lately had not trusted any animal emerging from the toril gate and was inclined to get the cape work over with quickly , to chop with the red serge muleta and then kill any way at all as long as the method presented no danger to Angel Teruel . He had shown promise in the old days . They said another Ordoiez , or another Ricardo Diaz . They were always saying that . 111  | Teruel could fool the tourists , who probably thought it unsporting that the bull always had to die , and he could fool the Spaniards who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two a year . The knowledgeable aficionados knew better . What they knew , and what they waited for , and what they saw less and less these days , was the approach to death . A matador must smell death in the hide and excrement and breath of the rushing bull , he must see death in the mean dark eyes , he must feel it in the whack of the horns against his belly as the bull follows the lure of the cape , and finally he must take it and transmute it , making the closeness of death an approach to immortality , feeling the immortality in himself as he stands with the smaller cape , the killing cape , facing the bull , urging the bull to pass , turning a quarter circle pivot as the bull comes by and whirls and comes again , until the feeling of a temporary immortality stretches out , stopping time , and he is both himself and all men , and the bull is that dark nothingness we all move toward with every tick of every clock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fend it off in the passing but held , graceful but deadly , tragic instant of a felt and conveyed immortality . " It 's not Angel 's day , " Ricardo Diaz said . Antonio Buenavista was glaring over the wooden fence . " It 's a pretty damn good bull . " The crowd came to its feet then , shouting ole ! to a deceptive pass in which Angel Teruel leaned in close after the horns of the big Pablo Romero bull swept by . The picing had already been done and the banderillas placed , and Teruel got a smear of blood on his suit of lights . That always brought the crowd to its feet . But it was a pass of value chiefly to Angel Teruel 's dry cleaner . And are n't you a cynical bastard , Ricardo Diaz thought . You did that sort of thing yourself , four years ago , when the fear 112  | grew . Except for those two fights in Madrid and a few others . A very few others . He had an excuse . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife was dying . The marriage had already gone sour but there had been no thought of divorce because Virginia had converted to the faith Ricardo Diaz had been born to , and she had taken the conversion seriously . She had taken other things seriously too . The danger , for one : a year after they were married she refused to see him fight . His long , on-again off-again affair with Maria Teresa for another . Virginia had come to Spain from Texas , eighteen years old , on her junior year abroad , to study at the University of Madrid . She met Ricardo Diaz at the Salvatierra caseta during Holy Week in Sevilla . He had just taken his alternativa as a matador , very young , very sure of himself . His father , who had worked as a banderillero for Antonio Buenavista , died of tuberculosis when the boy was five . He had never known his mother . She had died in childbirth . Buenavista had raised him as his own son until the boy was fourteen . Then  --  he hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He cut sugarcane in Almeria , he picked oranges on the flat green huerta of Valencia , he wandered north and worked as a bootblack in Barcelona , then crossed the border into France and found work as a busboy in the Carlton Hotel in Cannes . He learned two things there : how nice it would be to be rich and seated at the tables he cleared , eating food and drinking wine that cost more than he earned in a month ; and that , quite improbably , he had a voracious appetite to learn . He read what he could in Spanish , and soon he learned to read French and English . He wanted to know . He had no idea how the knowledge would serve him , the bits and pieces tucked away in his brain , but he had to discover them and own them . And then he learned a third thing . He was very attractive to women , to 113  | the beautiful , jaded women from Paris and London and New York who stayed at the Carlton Hotel . He visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was seventeen . He worked at this new and reasonably pleasant profession for a year . The women gave him gifts . For the first time in his life he had money . On the beach of the Croisette one day , his day off , a flabby Frenchman he had never seen before walked up to him and without a word hit him , rather ineffectually , and called him names , and the names were quite accurate but even so at seventeen you have to hit back . He was tall and rangy and he punished the man with a swift efficiency . A crowd had gathered and the police came . Ricardo Diaz ran . They found him that night in a barn near a village above the middle corniche . They took him to the local gendarmerie and administered what the French call a severe correction . Then they drove him to the border . He had entered France with no papers and no money and left the same way . He crossed at night a few miles from La Junquera and worked his way south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich , and the knowledge he had got from the books in Spanish , French , and English , and he returned to Antonio Buenavista 's home in Marbella . Buenavista greeted him as if he had hardly been away . " I want to be a bullfighter , Don Antonio . " " Naturally . It took a little longer than I thought , that 's all . " Virginia King was not King Ranch , Texas , but she had money , or her family did . They were married three months after meeting during Holy Week in Sevilla . Virginia was tall , blond , intelligent , a warm laughing beauty . She loved Spain and she loved Ricardo Diaz . It was very easy to fall in love with her . Her father flew over from Texas , furious . " I can have it annulled , " he said . 114  | Ricardo Diaz said nothing . " How much money will buy you off , you son of a bitch ? " " Virginia 's going to have a baby , sir . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to cut her off . I probably will . Jesus God , a baby . " Ricardo Diaz did not need the King money . In his final year as a novillero , an apprentice fighter of bulls , he had earned fifty thousand dollars , more than most matadors . By then he really did love Virginia . " We do n't need your money , " he told her father . " We do n't want it . " " This is no life for her . " Virginia disagreed . She was stubborn . Her father flew back to Texas . Ricardo Diaz never saw the man again . Virginia 's share of the King wealth was to be held in trust until she was thirty-five , but she did not live to be thirty-five . The life , after all , had been no life for her , certainly not after the Duchess of Salvatierra , whom they had first seen with braces on her teeth at the caseta in Sevilla , grew up . She was n't beautiful , not beautiful the way Virginia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humor and that mind with its own darting logic and a sensuality Ricardo Diaz could not resist . The problem , he could tell himself later , was that Virginia stayed home in Puerto Real while Maria Teresa followed his corridas when she was n't going to illegal political meetings . He could tell himself that to avoid blaming himself . Virginia 's face became flaccid with alcohol . She took to that American foolishness of communicating with him through their older son Alberto . " Alberto , ask your father to give me a little more wine , please . " She became something he left behind at the ranch , like the first of his Ferraris or the failure of the avocado trees . He hardly saw her , and then he went for months , especially during the temporada , without seeing her at all . 115  | Her liver failed . She died of internal hemorrhages in the Segovia clinic in Torremolinos  --  having chosen it , probably , because Dr. Segovia had been trained in the States  --  while Ricardo Diaz was winning two ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigtail after San Isidro . Four years ago . He had never stopped blaming himself after the first year of conveniently blaming Maria Teresa . He had killed Virginia as surely and as crudely as Angel Teruel was now slaughtering the bull by going in around the side and stabbing for the lung in the Puerto Real bullring. 116  | From the Strait of Gibraltar northeast past Malaga , Spaniards will tell you , the weather is as unpredictable as a beautiful woman who does not believe in God . It never rains on that stretch of coast in May . Well , senor , almost never . But if it should rain in May , senor ? And the Spaniard draws in his breath . Ah , senor , then you will see a storm . The clouds piled high , roiling upward , less than an hour after the first bullfight of the fiesta . The air was sultry and hot and at first there was no wind , and then the wind came hard and suddenly , and the temperature dropped fifteen degrees in fifteen minutes . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big 117  | as silver duros . Soon thunder ripped the darkness and bolts of lightning plunged into the luminous sea . Then the rain came heavily , in sheets , like a waterfall . It was no night for fishing in a small boat , and no night for a party in the garden of a villa in Benalmadena . The unexpected thunderstorm that might have saved Pedro Ramirez 's life the night before , or at least postponed his death , sent Kate Cameron 's guests scurrying for the shelter of the villa . Kate was no compulsive party-giver . Once a year would do quite nicely , she always said , and that once a year was the first night of fiesta . It was a big party , and looked forward to since the previous autumn in London , when one of the Beautiful People , after the theater curtain fell , might have said , " Well , my dear , I 'll see you at Kate 's in May . " It was an exciting party , and the previous winter on the Piz Nair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poised at the top of the run in Bogner finery , kicking air-cushioned boots into Spademan bindings on Rossignol skis , might look over her shoulder at the man she had met and slept with the night before and say , " Darling , you really must come to Kate 's in May . " " May , where 's that ? " " Benalmadena , silly . It 's in Spain , " and the Beautiful Person would tilt forward and the unvirginal body would glide down over virgin snow . It was a party that struck sparks , because Kate with a perverse amusement would invite all the right and all the wrong guests , and the Beautiful People , weary of New York , jaded with Paris , unimpressed by Sardinia , would say , " Last year she had this fellow Max , God knows where she got him . I think he 's a Spaniard . He weighs three hundred pounds and talks with an accent like Sid Caesar German and is the world 's biggest collector of miniatures , miniature anythings , and he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , came in costume . They were Moors or they were Spaniards . They wore turbans and 118  | sashes and pantaloons and soft Moroccan slippers with toes upcurved like the prows of tiny boats . Or they wore black cloaks and doublets and silk stockings and Velazquez ruffs around their necks . The party 's theme suited the fiesta of Puerto Real . Kate Cameron had simply moved it fifteen miles along the coast and a thousand feet up into the hills . The fiesta commemorated that day in 1492 when Caliph Boabdil had looked back on Granada and wept before leading his men down through the mountains to the sea . The rear guard , with Ferdinand and Isabella 's cavalry breathing down their necks , had left from Puerto Real . It had not been called Puerto Real then , but Ferdinand and Isabella had quickly changed the ridiculous Moorish name of the small port the way Spaniards , since 1939 , have changed the names of five hundred streets in the peninsula to Avenida Generalissimo Franco . Franco himself , asleep in Castillo del Moro , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , Elizabeth wearing a harem costume that would have given a eunuch some ideas he thought had been nipped along with an essential part of his anatomy . Jean Paul flew down from London in his Lear jet . His friends called him Paul and he was eighty years old . Thanks to his oil interests , the depletion allowance , and a brigade of tax attorneys busily performing financial and legal legerdemain in a dozen countries , he was the world 's wealthiest man . Dale Wassermann was there , and a man who lived in Paris and was no longer the boy wonder of American novelists . A long-haired , mustached tennis player , who had the potential to and one of these years would beat Stan Smith consistently , was there . Two British M.P . ' s were there , without their wives . An 119  | Academy Award-winning actress who liked her girls any way at all as long as they were willing was there . The Emir of a Trucial State , the deposed head of a military junta in South America , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . A Jewish violinist who lived in the Bernese Oberland with his sister was there , as was Andres Segovia . Miss Kitchen , who had contrived to miss her plane in Malaga , was there . The Spanish aristocracy , in the persons of some of the Medinacelis and Albas and Don Alfonso de Salvatierra , was there . The man who had said Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway , was there . A fat , garrulous man with a deep rolling laugh , who had terrified the eastern seaboard of the United States with a radio program at about the time Franco came to power in Spain , was there . Half a dozen bullfighters and Don Eduardo Miura , whose bulls no one wanted to fight , were there . Another man named Eduardo had come with Don Alfonso . He had a shaven skull and he looked Prussian except for the incongruously liquid eyes and soft mouth . He was Eduardo Santo Domingo , Director General of Security . " Understand , I 'm not defending you , " the man who had said Fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eduardo who bred bulls , " but you Spaniards are no worse than anyone else . Historically , I mean . You have to suffer the legacy of Henry VIII , that 's all . The so-called Black Legend . Oh , I 'm not saying Torquemada and the Inquisition did n't do a hell of a lot to keep Spain in the Dark Ages , but what the hell was going on in the rest of Europe at the time , that 's what I want to know ? For every Spanish heretic burned at the stake they burned a hundred witches in Westphalia and Scotland and 120  | Salem , Massachusetts . The same goes for Franco , that 's all I 'm trying to say . He 's no better and no worse than the rest of them . He 's just a politician . Fuck all politicians , " said the man who had said Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway . " I never discuss politics , " said the Don Eduardo who bred bulls , and followed his champagne goblet to the wall where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking with his son . " One of these days , Ricardo , you must fight my bulls again , " Don Eduardo said . Ricardo Diaz smiled . " I 'd be a hundred forty years old by the time you bred the nervousness out of them . " " Ah , the nervousness , " said Don Eduardo . " Always the nervousness . What about you , young man ? " " Better ask me after Sunday , Don Eduardo , " Jose Carlos said . He still had that Texas Longhorn quarterback look , despite the nights in Torremolinos . Miura laughed , and the last note of his laughter merged with the first abrupt chord of Andres Segovia 's guitar , and for the next half hour Kate Cameron 's guests listened to Bach as only Segovia could play him . Miss Kitchen was tone deaf and waited impatiently for the recital to end . Then she sought out Don Alfonso . His face had a pinched look over the Velazquez ruff when he saw her . " I thought you were back in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could I , sweetie ? Are n't you a little bit glad ? I thought maybe another set of tennis or a visit to that cute little tower of yours , so I drove back . The police shooed me away . Sweetie , why do you have the police there ? They can frighten a delicate girl like me . " It was no secret . Far from it . The idea was to publicize Franco 's visit . The Caudillo , in more than decent health , had come to Puerto Real for the fiesta . He had looked in less than 121  | decent health the one glimpse Don Alfonso had caught of him when they whisked him in a wheelchair from the tennis courts to the villa . " I have Franco as a houseguest , " Don Alfonso said . " Franco ! " cried Miss Kitchen in a strident voice , and she caught Don Alfonso 's arm above the elbow and expertly gave him an instant of exquisite pleasure . She could see his eyes change in the pinched , worried face as Eduardo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissing air during the introductions . His velvet-soft eyes looked at Don Alfonso , though his words were for Miss Kitchen . " Yes , dear lady , the Chief of State himself , " he said in excellent English . " I regret the necessity of the police but I 'm sure , as an American , you understand . " " I 'm British , " Miss Kitchen said . " Saint Sunday , what a lovely , what a terribly Spanish name . Are you really chief of police of the entire country ? " " Director of Security , dear lady . It is n't quite the same . " " With dungeons and ways of ferreting out all the little radicals and clever devices for making them talk ? " Don Alfonso 's face became more pinched . She was saying those things to needle him , he knew . " Dear lady , " said Santo Domingo , " I 'm afraid you read too many thrillers . " He inclined his chin in a small bow and left them . " I 'll kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , " Don Alfonso said in a furious whisper . " Sweetie , do n't make me laugh . I 'm black belt . I could mop up the floor with you , and you 'd love it . " Ricardo Diaz was talking with his son and with Antonio Buenavista when Santo Domingo joined them under the Picasso portrait . " This is the boy , eh , Don Ricardo . " 122  | " Jose Carlos , " Diaz introduced them , " I 'd like you to meet Colonel Santo Domingo . " " I le has aficion  --  for a cop , " Antonio Buenavista chuckled . " Sure , the Security Chief , " Jose Carlos said very quickly in English . He smiled . " I 'll bet he goes on the freebie list . You ca n't be too careful with a big wheel in Security . " " Precisely , " said Santo Domingo in his precise English . " Especially since the Security Chief really does enjoy the bullfights , Jose Carlos . " " Whoops , " Jose Carlos said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not in costume . He wore one of his dark Savile Row suits and , now , a look of amusement on his face . " I look forward to your alternativa on Sunday . Do n't speak English to the bull , though . He would n't understand it . " Santo Domingo turned to Ricardo Diaz . " Don Ricardo , if you have a minute ? " The two men went to the broad sweep of window wall . The drapes had not been drawn . Lightning speared into the sea far below . " Quite a spectacle , " Santo Domingo said . " They 'll be fighting knee-deep in mud tomorrow . " " I 'd like your opinion on something . If you were Maria Teresa de Salvatierra and if you had returned to Spain secretly and wanted to hide , where would you go ? " " Is she back ? " " We think so . Where , Don Ricardo ? " Ricardo Diaz looked at him . " My place , " he said . Santo Domingo 's soft mouth pursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Ricardo . That was wise of you . It would have been unpleasant to arrest the duchess while Franco accepted her hospitality . Or her cousin 's hospitality , anyway . We do n't want to make a fuss , and I see you do n't either . " 123  | " What about her cousin ? " " The cousin does n't have to know . When the fiesta ends , the Caudillo will grant the usual political amnesty . He invariably does , you know , during these charity affairs . She 'll be included . " Ricardo Diaz did not doubt that . Any list of political criminals to be amnestied would be drawn up by the Director General of Security . " Provided , " said Santo Domingo , " she keeps out of trouble between now and Sunday . Could you help us there ? " " I do n't know . " " She 's family  --  the old grandees . During the inevitable period of transition we 'll need their cooperation . " " You 'd get their cooperation no matter what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time ago , Don Eduardo . That is n't what 's bothering you . " Santo Domingo sighed . " She has a following . Among the worker-priests , the peasants , the students . That 's where trouble will come during the transition . " " Grant her amnesty now and what 's to stop her from picking up where she left off , organizing their riots ? " " Nothing , " Santo Domingo admitted , and then Ricardo Diaz understood . " You want her to stay out of trouble now so you can use her later . The best agent provocateur is the one you do n't have to pay , is n't it ? " " Did you know , " said Santo Domingo , " that the man responsible for the death of your son was murdered ? " Ricardo Diaz waited , perhaps a second too long . " No , I did n't know that . " " He was murdered in Malaga last November . The crime has never been solved . " The velvet eyes studied Ricardo Diaz guile-124  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us with the duchess . " Ricardo Diaz wondered if he could convince Maria Teresa to leave Spain for good . " I 'll see what I can do , " he said . " I 'm glad you see things my way , " Santo Domingo told him . " There 's one thing you can do for me , " Diaz said . He described the man he had met outside the Gran Corillo in Madrid . " You would n't happen to know him ? " " It could be a lot of people . " Santo Domingo considered for a moment . " You said he has a way of looking at you as if you were n't there ? That sounds like Jesus Quintana . " " Who is he ? " " He works for the Admiral . He 's down in Puerto handling security during the Caudillo 's stay . Where 'd you happen to run across him ? " Ricardo Diaz looked out at the darkness . " In Puerto , " he said . Santo Domingo waited for elaboration , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remains of the lavish buffet . Dale Wassermann and the former boy wonder novelist argued about the death of the novel as an art form . The richest man in the world allowed himself a third glass of champagne , against his doctor 's orders . The fat man who had terrified the eastern seaboard of the United States with a radio program recounted how he had introduced Marlene Dietrich to Greta Garbo in Hollywood . The Jewish violinist from Switz-125  | erland learned , to his surprise , that the Emir of the Trucial State was not anti-Semitic . The man who had said Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway , cornered Richard and Elizabeth and related the incident in loving detail . Ask Ava Gardner , he said , she was there . But Ava Gardner , at that time , had been following Luis Miguel Dominguin all over Spain and Dominguin , who had done the bullfighting sequences in Around the World in Eighty Days , had not fought in Pamplona that year , Richard pointed out . " Fuck all actors , they 're all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway , and Richard , somewhat drunk , wanted to throw him through the window wall , but Elizabeth talked him out of it . The poetrywriting would-be President of the United States decided he might write a book about Spain . He would change his mind in the morning : Brennan and Pritchett and Michener had already said it all . The tennis player who would beat Stan Smith consistently one of these days flirted with Miss Kitchen , to no avail . She eyed the man who had said Fuck you , Mr. Ernest Hemingway , speculatively . The deposed head of the South American junta told anyone who would listen that he intended to go back when his people needed him . " Your father 's worried about you , Joey , " Kate Cameron told Jose Carlos . " I knew a guy once in school in the States , " Jose Carlos said . " His old man was a surgeon , his uncle was an internist , his older brother a cardiologist . It was all laid out for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , he could n't stand the sight of blood . " " Did he go to med school ? " " He died of serum hepatitis from a dirty needle . Mainlining . You just ca n't figure it all out for a guy . He has to figure it out for himself . " " Yes , I can understand that . " 126  | " My father ca n't . He got it from his old man , and Buenavista I guess . That makes me the third generation . What if I do n't want to be a goddamn bullfighter ? " " Do n't you ? " " I do n't know what I want . He wo n't give me the chance to find out . I do n't even know if I 'm Spanish or American . " " I could talk to him , Joey . " " No ! That 's even worse . I have to work this out for myself . He 's so damn Spanish . You know what I mean ? " " I know what you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . Then he said : " You 're in love with him , are n't you ? " Kate said : " I never discuss my love life after two o'clock in the morning . " She looked at her watch . " It wo n't be easy following Segovia , but it 's about time for the dancers . " " Flamenco ? " Jose Carlos made a face . " The jota . I brought a troupe down from Aragon . They 're very good . Flamenco 's been corrupted . The jota goes all the way back to the Moors . It 's the most typically Spanish dance of all . " " Yeah , " Jose Carlos said . " Do n't you like it ? " " Sure I do . That 's the trouble . " 127  | On Thursday afternoon Jose Carlos parked the Dodge wagon on the broad paseo of the Alameda in Malaga . Sunlight filtered through the leaves of the plane trees and fronds of the date palms , picking out color on the mosaictile sidewalk . Jose Carlos gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a slip of paper under the windshield wiper . " Spain , " Maria Teresa was saying as she got out of the station wagon , " is incapable of having political parties as they 're known in France or England or the United States . Do you know why ? " Maria Teresa was wearing a sober black dress and low-heeled shoes . She looked tiny standing next to Jose Carlos . 129  | " I know my father will hit the roof when I do n't show up to cape Diego Puerta 's bulls . " " Because , " said Maria Teresa , " once a Spaniard becomes involved with a political party , the party means more to him than the country . A Spaniard does n't send a congratulatory telegram to the man who beats him on election day . He 's more inclined to shoot him . That 's what went on before the Civil War , more or less . " " Then what was all that stuff you were feeding me in Paris about parliamentary democracy ? " " Oh , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they walked along the Alameda . " Meanwhile , we need a strong paternal leadership . " " I thought you hated Franco 's guts . " " I never said I hated Franco . In fact , I admire him . I just happen to detest his government . " " They always say , " Jose Carlos said in English , " that dames do n't have the most logical minds going . " " Politicians are basically hypocritical , " Maria Teresa told him . " Right-wing , left-wing , middle-of-the-road , it does n't matter . They all claim they 're serving the best interests of the people when what they 're really doing is helping themselves to the biggest slice of pie . If you make enough waves , they have to give a little of it away . The more waves you make , the more they have to give . " Maria Teresa took his arm . " They 're mostly mediocre timeservers , often stupid , who ? " " You think Franco 's stupid ? " " Not at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of all is that he 's always been basically nonpolitical . The ideology buffs are definitely not for him . But he uses them . Discards them too , when he no longer needs them . That 's what happened to the Falange . Franco used them , then buried them 130  | in the Movimiento . They have about as much power in Spain today as Trotskyites have in Russia . Franco 's no fascist . He never was . Iie 's just an old-fashioned right-wing dictator . His cronies are something else again  --  political hacks who tend to see enemies everywhere . They 're almost paranoid , which means you have to be careful . " " Since when have you been careful ? " " Well , if you 're too careful you ca n't get anything done , can you ? I have to take calculated risks . Besides , it 's fun . Being a duchess can be pretty dull . But you only take a risk when it stands to gain something . Politicians ca n't function without stability , you see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor makes a speech against the Army , and the students riot . What happens then ? " " They close the university . " " They 'll open it eventually , and the Army will be a little less sacrosanct . " Maria Teresa glanced quickly up at his face . " I used the wrong example , did n't I ? That 's how Alberto got killed . " " He was a funny guy . Much more Spanish than me . You could never tell what he was thinking . He was going to get into trouble whether you came along or not . " " And you 're not Spanish ? " " Look , " Jose Carlos said , suddenly angry . " People keep telling me what I ought to be . My father . Kate Cameron . Now you . If you all left me alone maybe I could figure it out for myself . " " Well , " Maria Teresa said lightly , " I 'll begin by leaving you alone for half an hour anyway . I have to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to know who you 're going to see . " They had walked from the bullring end of the Alameda past the city hall and the post office to where the plane trees and 131  | date palms gave way to orange trees and sidewalk cafes and the gleaming facade of the Malaga Palacio Hotel . " If only you knew how Spanish you really are . " Maria Teresa smiled at the stubborn expression on his face . " Find a table in the shade and have a drink , Jose Carlos . I wo n't be long . " She patted his arm and turned the corner past the big hotel , looking demurely anonymous in her sober black dress . Miss Kitchen walked past the hotel doorman and blinked in the bright sunlight . The young woman in black just going around the corner looked familiar . Kate Cameron 's party ? Miss Kitchen wondered . No , that was n't it . Miss Kitchen frowned and remembered . She had seen portraits of the woman hanging in Castillo del Moro . Not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure of it now , was Alfonso 's cousin , the exiled duchess . Pretty little thing , Miss Kitchen thought . She decided it would be amusing to tell Alfonso she had seen her in Malaga . There was no wind that afternoon , and no need to work the bull near the cliff that loomed over one side of the miniature bullring at Rancho Andaluz . It was just as well . That part of the arena was still a quagmire from last night 's rain . The bull was a novillo , a three-year-old animal a hundred kilos or so off its full weight , but the horns were good and the bull , not force-fed on grain , had strong legs and considerable 132  | staying power . Ricardo Diaz swung the large , stiff percale cape slowly before the charging novillo in the classic pass , the veronica , which is both the foundation of the bullfighter 's art and the measure of his skill . It was a good veronica , and Ricardo Diaz turned to execute it again as the bull came by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep of the cape short and snapped it in so that the cloth wrapped itself around his body . The bull , instead of rushing by and wheeling to come back again , attracted by the lure , galloped past and pulled up short . Diaz strutted away , his back to the animal , with a stylized arrogance he did not feel . He waved Antonio Buenavista into the ring . " You take him a while , " he said , and leaned against the fence to watch the older man , moving slowly but with grace , approach the bull with his own cape . Then he turned and looked down the unpaved road toward the highway . No sign of the Dodge wagon , no sign of Jose Carlos . The boy had left the ranch before Diaz had returned for lunch , and a quick check had revealed that Maria Teresa was gone too . Turning back to the ring , holding the collar of the rose and gold cape in both hands , ready to run across the sand and divert the bull if Buenavista @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jose Carlos apparently thought he could walk into the Puerto Real bullring on Sunday without any preparation at all . Maria Teresa apparently was encouraging him . Diaz lit a cigarette . The anger gave way to an empty feeling , like the first words out of a peasant 's mouth when he wanted to show his contempt for the futility of life : " Nada , hombre . Nada . " Nada : nothing . But more than that . It was a word that encompassed the bleak , dessicated Spanish landscape , the hard weary days of the peasant 's life , the naive folly of thinking that anything was of consequence in a world guided not by a benign 133  | deity but by an indifferent fate . Nothing and nothing . And again nothing . Not even despair , not now , because the end of it all , the nada , hombre , nada of the peasant 's metaphysical contempt , was waiting for him on Sunday . Not according to Jesus Quintana . According to Quintana , whom he had seen that morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity if anything went wrong . It all had been arranged carefully  --  the escape route , the phony passport , properly visa-stamped , the money in a bank in New York . He had met Quintana at the foot of the street that went down from the Puerto Real town hall to the beach . It was early and the cafes that lined the beachfront promenade still empty except for the waiters unstacking chairs and setting them around the small tables . A few beach boys moved slowly across the sand , opening umbrellas , placing cushions on the slats of the beach chairs , preparing the day for tourists who thought their hangovers would be baked out by the brutal sun and rinsed away by the polluted sea . Quintana got there five minutes after he did , behind the wheel of a nondescript Renault . " Get in , matador . " Quintana made a quick U-turn and drove back up the hill past the town hall . They drove in silence for fifteen minutes , Quintana handling the little car with the careless disdainnada , hombre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The coast highway was already crowded with trucks . The Renault threaded its way among them as if they were n't there , cutting in and out of lane , crossing the double yellow line to pass a semitrailer and then darting back in , buffetted by the slipstream of a truck coming the other way , missing a head-on collision by a split second . Not that Quintana was in any hurry . He just drove that way . A professional racing driver , an Englishman , had once told 134  | Ricardo Diaz that most Spaniards ought to be outlawed from the roads . " It 's not a game to them , as it is to your Italians , " he had said , " and they do n't consider it a challenge , as the Krauts do . They simply refuse to believe that any other driver would dare get in their way . It 's your damnable Spanish mentality . There 's the individual , and the universe , and very little else between . It 's almost impossible to convince a Spaniard that anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard way . Head-on collisions tend to be fatal . " They drove through Torremolinos and then climbed a potholed blacktop road , leaving the garish strip of the Costa del Sol , international and tastelessly modern , and going back two hundred years among the olive groves and almond trees and peasants with their plodding burros beyond the first range of hills . Spiky aloes grew along the roadside , and whitewashed red-tile-roofed villages fled by , and the small churches waited , starkly white in the morning sunlight , for fewer communicants every year because the priests could only offer the hope of salvation , but the owners of the hotels and restaurants on the coast below offered the hard reality of good wages . Quintana turned off the potholed road and drove a few hundred yards along a dirt track into an olive grove . Last night 's rain had eroded the red clay here and there , exposing gnarled ancient roots . Ricardo Diaz could just make out the glint of sun on sea through a cut in the treeless hills . Quintana got out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , " he said . " It 's a nice spot , " he elaborated , looking around , " unless you happen to be a peasant . " His admiring glance took in the bare hills and the blue sky . " Did you know that murderers are rarely caught in the act when witnesses are present ? Half the time , in a crowd , they 're not even identified . There are a few moments of stunned inaction , while everyone waits to see what everyone , else will do . 135
