The circus band begins to play and general hubbub is heard from the crowd coming up to the ticket window . Colored lights sweep the stage and roustabouts may be seen setting up various pieces of equipment . FRED ( In his spotlight . ) Ladies and Gentlemen ! Only ten minutes left to buy tickets to the uniquely fabulous and gloriously original 1978 edition of Circus Valentine.Bring those little ones to see the circus the way the circus should be seen , under an acre of canvas sky . Smell that sawdust and slide onto those genuine wooden seats , for you are about to experience the most fearless and fantastic performers , both animal and human.You 'll see the courageous and daring Antonio Navarro , whose ferocious lions and tigers are not tamed or trained , but held captive by his hypnotic gaze.You 'll thrill to the death-defying flight of Countess Eva Vladimirov , the rebellious darling of the Moscow Circus.You 'll warm to the sight of Grace Kelly , seven thousand pounds of elephantine elegance , pirouetting delicately on her jeweled ball.But I know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Circus Valentine 's very own set of authentic Siamese twins , their inside arms joined fingertip to shoulder , standing and sleeping side by side , walking arm in arm for life . And juggling . Yes , juggling . You wo n't believe it . Even when you see it you wo n't believe it . But it 's absolutely true . Welcome to Circus Valentine , the most awe-inspiring and spellbindingly superlative little circus in the entire world.Step right up . Just a few good seats left . p. 3 IN THE WARDROBE TENTGoldie and Eva are inside the wardrobe tent , just before the show begins . Goldie is wearing one half of the Siamese twin clown costume , Eva is avoiding getting in the other half . GOLDIE Get your ass in this costume , Eva . VLADIMIROV No .

This is your chance . Get in here . p. 4 VLADIMIROV I hate you . GOLDIE Lift your foot . ( Eva steps into the costume . ) VLADIMIROV You should never have married Freddie . GOLDIE What 's the matter with Freddie ? He hauls your trapeze from town to town , he hires your websitters and feeds your ponies . VLADIMIROV They need a bath . GOLDIE Tell Oz .

Where are Brad and Bill ? p. 5 GOLDIE ( Taking off her mask . ) Daddy took them somewhere , honey . I think they hurt their foot . TRINA Brad or Bill 's ? VLADIMIROV It 's all right , darling . They 've still got three left . TRINA Eva , how can you  --  GOLDIE So Eva and I are doing the opening number in their costume . Do you need something ? TRINA Not really .

OZ Your Dad says they had an accident . VLADIMIROV They did not have an accident . They are an accident . OZ And they find you hopelessly disconnected .

NAVARRO My darling ( Eva flips up her mask. ) p. 7 VLADIMIROV It 's us , bear brain . ( Goldie flips up her mask . ) GOLDIE And my daughter is not your darling . NAVARRO Oh , but she 's everyone 's darling . Where are the twins ? TRINA They got hurt , but it 's nothing serious . NAVARRO If they 're hurt , it 's serious . TRINA They went bowling .

NAVARRO You know what will happen if the cats smell mint ! OZ I got it all , O.K. ? VLADIMIROV But there 's always hope . Maybe one little sprig leftmaybe your Sheba will smell it , and NAVARRO If the cats kill me out there , Eva , I 'll steal your show . VLADIMIROV Just do n't bleed too much . I do n't want to mess up my shoes . TRINA You 're making me sick , all of you . Brad and Bill are hurt and all you 're thinking of is yourselves ( Fred enters , dressed in his Ringmaster costume. ) p. 8 NAVARRO Fred . Where are the twins ? FRED They 're at General Hospital . Oz will go pick them up during the show . We might have to hold the second act for a few minutes , but NAVARRO You took them to a charity hospital ? FRED It 's the best emergency room in town .

Maybe my old husband will be clawed to death by his lions . NAVARRO ( To Fred . ) Fire her or I quit . VLADIMIROV Fire him or I quit . FRED Fine . You 're both fired . TRINA You ca n't fire Tony , Daddy . FRED The only people I ca n't fire are the twins and Grace Kelly . p. 9 GOLDIE And me . OZ And me . TRINA And me . VLADIMIROV And me . NAVARRO And me .

( Tony exits , followed by Trina . ) TRINA Tony ! ( Fred notices Trina 's interest in Tony . But decides not to do anything about it today . He pulls a flower pot out of his coat sleeve , and turns to Goldie and Eva . ) FRED All right , girls . It 's not enough just to have the twins ' costume , you have to do their walkabout . So . Goldie , you start taking the pot up to somebody in the crowd . Then just as they get it in their hands , Eva , you grab it away . Then Goldie you get it back somehow  --  point to something in the sky , hit Eva over the head , something  --  then it starts all over .

( They walk off toward their entrance into the tent , and lights begin to swirl . ) FRED ( In his spotlight . ) Ladies and Gentlemen , boys and girls , the moment you 've all-been waiting for ! Lights down , please . Welcome to the wonderful world of Circus Valentine ! ( We hear applause and music for the opening number , the parade that precedes the first act . ) IN THE ANIMAL AREALights come up on Oz , brushing one of the elephant blankets . The thief wakes up and finds himself chained to the fence . LEROY Hey ! OZ Nice nap ? LEROY What the hell ? Chains are for animals , man . OZ Dig that ball out and you can go . It 's under all that shit somewhere . Use my shovel . LEROY You ca n't make me do that . OZ Yeah , and you ca n't make me unlock your chain . LEROY ( Takes the shovel , begins to dig . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Name 's Oz . ( Suddenly , a businessman approaches . Not happy. ) p. 11 REEVES Where 's Valentine ? OZ Show 's on . REEVES I know that . I just watched the start of that " parade " OZ It 's good , huh . REEVES It was a joke . Whoever that is in that Siamese costume , it 's not those boys . Now , I told Valentine , as long as this show had those Siamese twins , we had a deal . But no boys , no deal . And that 's not only for here , that 's for every one of the dates I set up for him for the next four weeks . Where are the twins ? OZ How 'd you know it was n't them ? REEVES I saw them in Owensboro . Those boys can juggle . Whoever this is , they 're doing good to walk . OZ Well . I would n't know , Mr REEVES It 's Reeves . You tell Valentine he better have those twins when I catch up to him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heart , I guess . REEVES You just tell him . It takes more than a dozen gypsies to fool me . LEROY How many does it take ? ( Oz laughs . Reeves ignores him . ) REEVES And you . Do something about this smell . ( Reeves storms off . ) ( Oz goes back to work. ) p. 12 LEROY Where are the twins ? OZ Are you hungry ? LEROY Hey , great . Thanks . OZ I 'm offering you a job , not a meal . The countess needs a websitter , somebody to hold her ropes . Pays 42 bucks a week , plus a bed , plus the cookhouse . ( Smiles . ) Put you in the center ring . LEROY You only got one ring . OZ Is that so ? LEROY You got one elephant , a coupla worn out ponies and a pack of scrappy lookin ' dogs , one cute chick that 's getting it on with the lion tamer , and a bunch of chickens under that ticket booth . What 's her name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . OZ You stay away from Trina . The last towner that fell for her , Freddie put him in the hospital . LEROY And the twins . I guess you 've got the twins . Do you honest-to-God shovel animal shit for a living ? OZ I shovel elephant shit . I do n't like animals . LEROY Elephants are animals . OZ Nope . Animals are smaller . p. 13 LEROY Where 'd you get her ? I mean , you guys ca n't afford an elephant , right ? I bet you ca n't even afford to feed her , am I right ? OZ A petting zoo left her in Marietta . She had colic , some idiot fed her cold water , she coulda died from that . Anyway , we were in Dalton , I read about it in the paper . Fred took everybody else on to Decatur , and I went to her . The U-Haul would n't rent me a truck when she got well . So you know how we caught up with them ? We walked . And ( Angrily. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia had ever seen an elephant before ! LEROY O.K. You 've got yourself a boy , a what 's it ? A websitter ? But just for today . OZ We do n't hire by the day . LEROY Well , I do n't work any other way . Do you want me or not ? OZ ( Wearily . ) The animals all need fresh , lukewarm water , when you 're through here . ( He walks off . ) LEROY ( Calling after him . ) She does the trapeze too , right ? That Trina chick ? ( He mimes a lion tamer cracking a whip . ) Back ! Back ! ( Lights down on Leroy . Swirling lights in the center ring . Spanish music is heard as offstage , Fred begins the intro. ) p. 14 FRED ( In his spotlight . ) And now , in the steel arena , vicious beasts from the wilds of Africa and Asia , under the hypnotic domination of the dashing , daring , death-tempter from Madrid , Antonio Navarro . IN THE CENTER RINGTony runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the " lions " to be let into the arena . Growls and roars are heard . We may see pedestals and hurdles , a huge ball , and a large ring . During his " Act " he will imitate the positions the lions take on these objects . This must not look funny , but as though he is doing it without thinking about it . As though he is the one who is trained . Tony is extremely intelligent and well-educated . He has not come from a circus family , and no one is more surprised than he to find himself traveling with this circus . NAVARRO ( In a mock Spanish accent . ) You have maybe noticed the tightness of my pants . It is so the lions will not catch them in their teeth . Or maybe for some other reason having to do with the young girls in the audience , eh ? ( Dropping the accent . ) I 'm thinking of dropping the accent . What do you think ? ( Cracking the whip . ) Back ! ( A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent thing she everNo , there was one other thing , although I did n't think it was so decent at the time . She was only 19 then . Calling herself Eva Sparrow . Tiny little body , tiny little feet . I learned this from her . It 's a bluff . The whole thing 's a bluff . You can stay alive if you can keep the lions from making a correct appraisal of the situation . ( Remembering to talk about animals . ) Cats start to go bad at about ten years old . If a cat chews on one side , it 's probably got a toothache . Have to watch for that . Feeding a live chicken will pick up a sick cat 's appetite . And bears are not afraid of gunfire.Eva worked snakes when she was a girl . They 'd get these baths in milk to keep their skins shiny . You ever watch a wild-haired woman wash a snake ? Tiny white hands stroking up that scaly hide ? Still gives me chills , dammit . I was a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Florida , animal husbandry . Thought I was giving all that up to marry Eva . Wrong . ( Back to the animals . ) Right . O.K. You ca n't let the cats hide meat in their cages after a feeding . They bring that meat into the arena with them , and you do n't break up that fight . You just hope like hell you can get out before it 's too late . ( Angrily . ) All I ever wanted from Eva was one of those milk baths . Like the snakes . So I fed her ponies and fed her dogs and rubbed her feet , but that was n't enough . So I taught lions to tell left from right and tigers to roll over and bears to ride bicycles and finally she married me . ( A moment . ) But I never got that milk bath . I never even got what the snakes got from Eva . I asked . Oh , yes . I had to ask . The snakes did n't have to ask , but I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " Do n't be silly " for years . It was silly . I knew it was silly . Oh for God 's sake , this whole thing is silly . ( Calmer . ) I understand now . I did n't get a milk bath because I was n't part of the act , and I was n't dangerous . I was just useful . But not useful enough , so she divorced me . But by that time I was a animal trainer so what the hell . I am a good animal trainer . One of the best . ( Back to the bravado . ) I have quite the footwork , eh ? Yes . I do have a way with them , animals . But I do not be their husband any more ! ( Tony stands for his final applause. ) p. 15 FRED Ladies and Gentlemen ! Antonio Navarro ! ( Tony jumps down from the platform then turns once more to the audience . Casually . ) NAVARRO I gave Eva 's snakes to a Chinese family . They were tough old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exits . ) ( Offstage in blackout , we hear a fire engine siren start up for the clowns ' Fire Brigade stunt . ) FRED ( In his spotlight . ) Help ! Help ! There 's a house on fire ! And look ! There 's someone at the third story window and I thinkOh no ! She has a baby in her arms ! Someone must help her ! Hurry ! Save that poor woman and her baby ! Wait ! Stop ! That 's not the Louisville Fire Department ! Those are the famous Cardwell Clowns ! - ( We hear screams of hysterical laughter as the clown stunt starts . ) OUTSIDE THE TENTFred rushes out to meet Oz , his tone changing drastically from the clown intro . FRED Ca n't this wait til intermission ? OZ I need ninety pounds of horsemeat . FRED So buy it . OZ There 's no money in the safe . FRED Oh , yeah . I paid off the tow trucks . Damn Owensboro mud cost us everything we took in. p. 16 OZ So how are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . OZ Fine . I need ninety pounds of horsemeat . FRED Take one of Eva 's ponies . OZ Feed one of Eva 's ponies to Tony 's cats ? FRED Dogs then . OZ What 's with you ? FRED You seen a guy named Reeves around here ? OZ Yeah . And he 's looking for you , too . FRED He 's got your feed money . We 're doing four weeks for him . OZ Not unless he sees the twins , we are n't . He saw the opening of the show . He knows they 're gone . FRED They 're not gone . OZ Whatever . Look . I need ninety pounds of horsemeat , one hundred pounds of hay , twenty pounds of grain , and twenty pounds of whatever you want to feed the dogs today . FRED What we should 've done , was salt down the chimps when they died . OZ This is not a joke . FRED Of course it 's a joke . This whole thing 's a joke . I spend my entire day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat so they 'll be strong enough to tear up their cat wagon , which I then have to pay to have repaired , and then have to pay to have hauled out of the mud because the water truck ca n't pull it because it needs new tires . But I got ta have horsemeat every day , because if the cats do n't eat , we 've got no reason to buy new tires for the seat wagon , or a new drive shaft for the stake puller so it can get this show on down the road where the cats will need to eat again . Yes sir , this better be a joke Oz or I 'm dumber than I thought . ( Oz finds the piece of paper Fred gave him earlier . He studies it. ) p. 17 OZ Did you already pay the Emergency Room for the twins ? FRED All you got ta do is pick them up . OZ Is there something you 're not telling me about this ? No . Are you gon na tell me what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you later . IN THE WARDROBE TENTEva and Goldie enter getting out of the Siamese twin costume . VLADIMIROV We did n't fool them . They knew we were n't the twins . GOLDIE You did n't even try . You kept running away from me . VLADIMIROV I 'm ashamed I agreed to do it in the first place . GOLDIE You 're ashamed of me . Even disguised , you 're ashamed of me . VLADIMIROV I am not ashamed of you . It 's just that GOLDIE You wish I were more like you . You wish I were exactly like you . You 'd like me so much better if I were n't so deep down ordinary . How can somebody like me be your sister ? Just does n't seem fair , does it , Eva . VLADIMIROV That 's ridiculous . GOLDIE It 's the truth . Well . I 'm not you . I 'm not as pretty as you . I do n't have any talent on the trapeze p. 18 VLADIMIROV You do have talent . You should GOLDIE The men never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . I 'm not you . But I 'm used to not being you , so you can please quit feeling so sorry for me . VLADIMIROV Are you happy ? GOLDIE Sure . Why not ? You ? VLADIMIROV A triple somersault would make me happy . Other than that , I really do n't care . GOLDIE It 's all you 've ever wanted , that triple . You and every other flyer I know . VLADIMIROV But I 'll get mine someday . GOLDIE What happens if that 's all you ever get ? VLADIMIROV Then I 'll have two things . Right now , I just have one . You . ( She makes some small affectionate , but not mushy gesture . ) ( Trina enters . ) TRINA I think something is the matter with the twins . VLADIMIROV They 're coming unglued ? GOLDIE Stop it . Just stop it . TRINA I 'm serious . They were drinking yesterday . And fighting . And Brad did n't want to play chess and Bill did n't whistle once , all day . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VLADIMIROV They have a sick relationship . GOLDIE And you 've had such healthy ones , Eva . VLADIMIROV Their relationship makes me sick . TRINA Dad says they 're pretty good bowlers . VLADIMIROV And every town we play , Freddie 's got to pay who knows how much to get some bowling alley to open early so they can be alone , together . I need new harnesses and Fred spends the money I earn renting them bowling shoes . TRINA They just want to go be ordinary . GOLDIE Well , they 're not doing it any more , not if I have anything to say about it . They get hurt and where are we ? Beached til they get well . VLADIMIROV We could go on without them . GOLDIE No we could n't . Everybody else has everything we have except them . Nobody else has them . VLADIMIROV Nobody else has me . GOLDIE No , Eva . Everybody else has you . Only the you they have is Trina 's age . VLADIMIROV And I guess you think you could tell fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's always the same , stupid , boring thing . GOLDIE It 's all we have . She 's ashamed of me and I feel sorry for her . VLADIMIROV Do n't ever have any sisters , darling . GOLDIE If she had some sisters , maybe we could keep this show going without the twins . VLADIMIROV But why should Freddie want to make babies when the flyer he married grew up to be a fortune-teller and cook ? GOLDIE And if you had n't dumped every man who ever loved you VLADIMIROV I ca n't be having babies . I have to fly . TRINA If this is the new argument , I 'll take the old one back . GOLDIE We do n't have much family . VLADIMIROV So we do n't have much circus . TRINA I could get married . EVA AND GOLDIE No ! TRINA What do you mean , no . I guess I can get married if I want . I guess I can kill myself if I want . And if you do n't think I can , do whatever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to get married , darling ? p. 21 TRINA I did n't say I wanted to get married . I did n't say what I want to do . I only said I want to do what I want to do . VLADIMIROV You just keep working . GOLDIE You have real natural talent , honey . VLADIMIROV Later , there will be time for men . Now . There is only time for the trapeze . There are some timing things that you have to learn right now or you 'll never get them right . In a few years , after a bad marriage , it will be too late to come back to the trapeze . TRINA Tony said he would teach me how to eat fire . GOLDIE Tony is not for you . VLADIMIROV And his fire is not so hot . GOLDIE ( To Eva . ) It was when you met him . You put it out ! TRINA He said there were just four little rules . Do n't eat fire in a high wind . Do n't eat fire if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a cold that would make you sneeze or cough . And do n't usesomething , I forgot what . Some kind of fuelDo n't use it . It turns you blue . GOLDIE We 'll find you somebody nice . You 're a special girl . You ca n't have just anybody . p. 22 TRINA I like Tony . GOLDIE He 's too old . TRINA He 's just going to teach me how to eat fire . I do n't mean to marry him . VLADIMIROV I did n't either . ( Offstage , Fred 's intro begins . ) FRED ( In his spotlight . ) The first people on Earth wanted to fly . TRINA What 's for dinner ? FRED Wanted to soar with the birds over the primeval forests and swamps below . Sure , we built airplanes , but they 're no more than passenger electric room fans . Eva Vladimirov flies . TRINA What 's for dinner ? GOLDIE I heard you the first time . I do n't know . VLADIMIROV We wo n't even know while we 're eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ride your precious ponies in the second act . VLADIMIROV You 'd break their backs . GOLDIE ( As she walks off . ) And we 'd all die of ptomaine . FRED Eva Vladimirov flies . With her young protege , Trina Valentine , she dares the seagull to be more graceful , dares the hawks to be more powerful , dares the eagles to be more serene . You will never see , this side of Heaven , a more dazzling aerial display . ( Eva and Trina wait in the wings to go on. ) p. 23 VLADIMIROV I love your Mother 's pancakes . TRINA She has neat hair . VLADIMIROV It runs in the family . Smile , darling . FRED And now , ladies and gentlemen , directing your attention first to the shimmering rope ladder , then to the tiny platform at the very top of the Big TopTrina Valentine , and the incomparable Countess Eva Vladimirov . IN THE CENTER RINGEva watches quietly as Trina steps into the spotlight and does her act . TRINA You ca n't just decide you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , you wo n't ever be it , really , no matter how hard you try . I was born to it . And when you 're born to it , you do n't ever have to worry about what you 're going to do because it 's going to be the same thing you 've been doing since you could ever remember doing anything. I do n't go to high school . I take correspondence courses from the Calvert School in Baltimore , it 's the law . Sometimes I think it would be fun to go to high school , but my arms are real muscular , you know , so I might feel funny out taking pictures for the yearbook or something.I 'm working the trapeze now . Eva and Mama did a great double trap turn when they were young . The Sparrow Sisters  --  da da . Eva did a triple somersault once . It was in practice , but she did it just the same . It 's all Time , see , and knowing how to fall , cause you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , something breaks and that 's why you fall . But sometimes people just let go . It 's " casting , " that 's what we call it . And nobody knows why people do it . One minute they 're fine and the next minute they just let go . And it 's not when they 're doing something hard , they could be doing some little flying return or something and it just happens . Their fingers just unwrap and straighten out all relaxed and they 've let go , only they did n't mean to . It 's not a mistake . They do n't lose their concentration or anything . It 's weird . They just let go.If they tuck and fall right , they 'll be O.K. though . You have to know how to fall right . Oh , I already said that . Lillian Leitzel once fell 55 feet from the top of the tent , and she did n't use a net either . The swivel on her wrist ring broke and she fell all the way , but she lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She died in the hospital a coupla days after that , but she looked just fine right after . Can you believe that , she stood up after that fall and took a bow.Oz has this motorboat and we go waterskiing sometimes . My arms are real strong , like I said , so I 'm kinda good at it . The best part , the very best part is at the end of the ride when one minute you 're skiing along and the next minute you just open up your fingers and the bar goes flying off after the boat and you just sink down so slow into the water . And that water feels so cold on your hands where they 've been holding the bar for so long.Oz says we could probably ski straight home from here . Down the Ohio to the Mississippi and across the Gulf and right into Tampa Bay and be home . And it probably would n't take more thanI do n't know ( Laughing at herself . ) Forever . p. 24 IN THE OFFICE TRAILERGoldie is changing into ordinary clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the door angrily .

Reeves offers a stern handshake . ) REEVES It 's Reeves . I own this mall . Where 's Valentine ? GOLDIE He 's not here . REEVES I did n't ask you where he is n't . I asked you where he is .

REEVES They 're inside . GOLDIE If we go inside and people see the costumes , they got no reason to come to the show . Also . If you make us use the ones inside , we steal the toilet paper and write on the walls . Our lion tamer , he steals faucets . I know , but we 're collectors . Picture postcards , little glass bottles , lightbulbs , display tables , popcorn machines REEVES How many bathrooms do you want ? GOLDIE Two would be nice .

I just sent my brother to the hospital to get them . You know . Accidents happen . REEVES Either they 're in the evening show or you can get this zoo off my property .

You put them on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you show tonight 's audience those Siamese twins and you show that they 're hooked together absolutely real and forever , or that is it ! No bathrooms , no parking lot , no four weeks of big malls , nothing to do with me or my friends again , ever , and I have a lot of friends . p. 27 FRED Do n't worry about the boys , Mr. Reeves . Brad and Bill are born entertainers . They 'll be back as soon as is humanly  --  REEVES I 've had posters printed and advertising . I 've told the people that we 'll have a circus with Siamese twin clowns and I will have a circus with Siamese twin clowns or I will have no circus . FRED You see the show yet ? REEVES I 've seen enough to know FRED Got some great acts . The twins are n't really that talented . REEVES Oh for Christ 's sake . They 're Siamese . I 'm a businessman , Valentine . And a fair man . And we could do a lot of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's got ta all be real simple . We make an agreement . Then I keep my part of the agreement , and you keep your part of the agreement . Or else I haul your ass into court and you spend the rest of your life in jail while I cut up your tent and sell it for sailboats . FRED Good . We understand each other . REEVES No , Valentine . You understand me . FRED Right . ( Reeves exits . Fred closes the door behind him and sits down . There is a considerable pause. ) p. 28 GOLDIE You should 've told him to shove it , Freddie . FRED How could I do that ? GOLDIE He treated you like shit . Why do you let people do that ? FRED Get off my back , Goldie . We 've had this conversation . GOLDIE No . We 've started this conversation . When we get really close to having this conversation , you always say we 've had this conversation . FRED I let people treat me like shit because I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because that 's how your sister gets to keep flying and her ex-husband gets to keep subjugating the ferocious beasts . Because that 's how my brother gets to hide behind his elephant and how we keep our daughter from marrying some jerk that pumps gas . ( She is angrier than she knows . She plunges into forbidden territory . ) GOLDIE It 's also how you forget that you grew up in the side show . It 's also how you forget that you 're the son of the Fat Lady . FRED ( Grabs her by the arm . ) I did n't hear that . And you did n't say it . GOLDIE I 'm sorry . p. 29 FRED I 'm going to watch Eva 's somersaults . See you later . GOLDIE Freddie . I do n't know what made me say that , what I said about your mother . I do n't know what 's the matter with me today . I ca n't get going somehow . I need to start thinking about supper but I keep wandering around like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before and I ca n't find where they put the raisins . Freddie . I want to have a baby . FRED No . GOLDIE No ? You just say no ? FRED We ca n't afford it . The doctor and the hospital and the clothes and the baby food and the playpen . It could cost a thousand dollars , Goldie , and that would put new tires on all the trucks . GOLDIE We 're going to make good money playing these big malls , are n't we ? FRED Goldie . Baby me , Goldie . I need it . GOLDIE Are the twins going to be all right ? FRED You just leave them to me . GOLDIE That 's what we 've always done , honey . We 're just worried , that 's all . FRED I got ta go . ( Fred runs out , as we hear applause coming from inside the circus tent . A drum roll begins and continues through Fred 's offstage intro. ) p. 30 FRED ( In his spotlight . ) Ladies and Gentlemen , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper can shatter the total concentration a flyer needs at this moment . ( A pause . ) The spotlight will find and follow her for you , fifty-five feet in the airCountess Eva Vladimirov , performing the double twisting somersault on the flying trapeze . IN THE CENTER RINGSpotlight on Eva . The Russian Accent is somehow softer and more believable . VLADIMIROV Flying . Oh Flying . I do not have much to say about flying . Except this . The day will come when I will fly for the last time . But when that day comes , I pray God I do not know it is that day . It is like the grandparents making love . The last time does come . But they do not want to know it is the last time they will be together in that way . It is the same with flying . Oh Flying . ( Eva takes a proud bow over enthusiastic applause . The spotlight goes out quickly , allowing her to disappear from the stage . ) IN THE OFFICE TRAILERTrina enters the office trailer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the applause ? GOLDIE No . TRINA Eva wanted to try the triple . I could tell . she was just dying to try it . p. 31 GOLDIE You ca n't do a triple somersault in a tent , you know it and she knows it . There 's not enough room over your head . And it 's also very hot up there . If the ropes stretch just this much , we could lose her . So do n't you encourage her . And Trina TRINA Yeah ? GOLDIE Stay away from Tony . TRINA But you were already married to Daddy when you were my age . GOLDIE There are some nice boys at home . TRINA They wo n't look twice at me . We 're not with the Big Show so they do n't care what I can do or who I am , even . GOLDIE There 's that Christiani cousin , and the Rock-Smith Flyers have  --  There 's Jorge Barrada . ( Apparently a very handsome young lion tamer . ) TRINA Sure . GOLDIE Do n't you worry . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect . TRINA Daddy 's not perfect . GOLDIE He was when I married him . TRINA He 's such a cheapskate . Eva ca n't have new ropes this year , and Tony has to pull the cats ' teeth himself because Daddy wo n't pay for a vet . Sometimes I think Daddy hates the circus . p. 32 GOLDIE Sometimes I hate it . TRINA Then what are you doing here ? You could 've gone to college . Daddy could own a deep-sea boat and take tourists out to catch marlins . He could be an anchorman on TV . You could have your hair done in a beauty shop , and maybe start a boutique or a plant shop . Yeah , selling orchids or something . GOLDIE You wish I sold plants . TRINA Sometimes . Yeah . Sometimes I wish you sold plants . GOLDIE And your Daddy were an accountant and you got an allowance and I signed your report card . You wish we were normal people . Well . We 're not normal and you should be proud of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so happy to see the circus . TRINA I guess . GOLDIE I do n't want to sell plants , honey . ( There is a moment . ) TRINA I had this great idea . I told the twins they should write a book and go on TV . Do variety shows and Christmas specials and stuff . In the off season , I mean . They do n't look so weird they 'd scare people . Would n't that be terrific ? Go on the late show , even . GOLDIE They do n't want to be stars , sweetie . TRINA But think of the money they could make . p. 33 GOLDIE If they were interested in money , they 'd be gone already . Besides , that would be like being back in the sideshow . Your daddy rescued them from that a long time ago , and I do n't think they want to go back to it , even if it means lots of money . TRINA I 'm gon na work real hard this winter . GOLDIE Good . TRINA If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TRINA I could do a triple . GOLDIE You could do anything you wanted . ( There is a knock at the door . Goldie goes to open it . ) LEROY You Goldie ? Oz said to tell you I 'm one more for supper . But I 'm not really one more cause your websitter or whatever you call it blew the show and I 'm just taking his place for today . It 's Leroy . ( Extends his hand . ) Hi . GOLDIE Supper 's at six . Have to wear a clean shirt . And there 's no snacks between meals so do n't ask . ( She starts to close the door on him . ) LEROY So what do I do ? GOLDIE Trina can tell you . I 'm in the kitchen if you want me , honey . p. 34 TRINA O.K. ( Goldie leaves , Trina sits down , takes off her headpiece , primps , very aware that he is watching , but is very condescending about it . ) LEROY Well ? TRINA You sit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sliding descent . The others are on stakes . LEROY What do I do during the act ? TRINA Watch , I guess . I do n't know what the last guy did during the act . I do n't see anything once I 'm up there . LEROY You do n't see how far down it is ? TRINA I know how far down it is . LEROY You could n't pay me enough money to get up there . TRINA You probably do n't have the arms for it anyway . LEROY Well , you sure do . Punched anybody out lately ? ( Trina moves toward the door . ) TRINA Get out of my way . LEROY ( Catches her . ) Hey , I 'm sorry . I really only came over here to meet you . That supper business was an excuse . You are one great looking girl . p. 35 TRINA Thank you . LEROY So what are you doing messing around with that lion tamer ? He could be your father . Unless that 's your thing , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . LEROY No , I know that . But what are you doing with this two-bit show ? You 're swimming in the wrong pond , baby . TRINA This is no two-bit show . LEROY You could do better . TRINA My Daddy owns this show . I could n't ever leave the circus . LEROY Who said anything about leaving the circus . I just mean go with a big show . Ringling does n't use hand-me-down costumes , I bet . I 'd like to see you in something that really fit . Whose is this , anyway ? TRINA Who are you , anyway ? LEROY They 've got you locked up here like some fairytale princess . TRINA What do you want ? LEROY I do n't know . TRINA Well if you think I 'm gon na believe you 're some talent scout or something , you 're wrong . And I 'm not about to run away with you either . LEROY Honey , I did n't ask you to run way with me , O.K. ? p. 36 TRINA You were about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want one night , that 's all . What time are you through ? TRINA Is this how you get girls ? You just walk right up and say I want to go to bed with you ? LEROY Sure is . TRINA And they go for it ? LEROY How about 10:30 ? TRINA Why should I go anywhere with you ? You came busting in here to tell me I 'm pretty only the way you said it was I must not be any good or I would n't be afraid to try out for Ringling . LEROY When 's the next try-out ? TRINA Sometime in February , the 14th , I think . LEROY You should be there . TRINA I have to get ready for intermission . LEROY 10:30 . Yes or no ? TRINA Maybe . LEROY That 's the spirit . Tell your lion tamer you 're going out for some exercise . ( Tony enters without knocking . ) LEROY Hey man . How 'd it go out there ? NAVARRO Do I know you ? p. 37 LEROY Must take a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This outfit got a good retirement plan ? ( Tony opens the door for Leroy . ) NAVARRO The best . You work til you die . We 'll see you later . ( Tony takes Leroy by the arm , ushers him out . ) LEROY Sorry I ca n't stay and talk . NAVARRO We understand . LEROY See you guys later . ( Tony closes the door behind Leroy . ) TRINA Hi . NAVARRO Come here , you pretty girl . TRINA Mother says to stay away from you . She says you 're not for me . NAVARRO ( Embracing her . ) And what do you say ? TRINA I told her you were teaching me to eat fire . NAVARRO Bet she loved that idea . TRINA When can we go , Tony ? NAVARRO Your Daddy owes me money , baby . TRINA I have some money . NAVARRO He owes me my bonus from last season . I mean , I 'm glad he did n't pay me then or I would n't have signed on for another season , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 38 TRINA Am I good enough for Ringling ? NAVARRO Tell me you love me . TRINA I want to go to Spain . NAVARRO It would hurt your mother . TRINA I know . We 're worse than the twins . You poke me in the middle of the night , and she wakes up . NAVARRO Your father would kill me TRINA Not if we were far enough away . NAVARRO Look . This is a bigger town than we 've played before , and we 're doing these malls for the next four weeks . That 's got to mean money . Your Daddy will pay me and we 'll just blow this old show . TRINA Tell me you love me . NAVARRO We 'll be inseparable . TRINA Like the twins . ( They laugh and kiss . Trina is giggling rather than laughing . They do not see the door open . ) TRINA Eva ! VLADIMIROV Get dressed . NAVARRO The Countess Vladimirov . VLADIMIROV ( To Trina . ) Leave us , darling . ( Tony pats her affectionately. ) p. 39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) VLADIMIROV What are you doing with my Trina ? NAVARRO Trina is a big girl now . VLADIMIROV What are you doing with my Trina ? NAVARRO She 's not your Trina . She 's her very own Trina , and the only reason she 's stayed with you this year is because I 'm here . VLADIMIROV You think you 're keeping her here ? NAVARRO I know it ! VLADIMIROV You with your slimy charm ? With your boring experience ? All you 're really good at is taking off your shirt . And thenyou do n't even have any good scars to show her . She ever ask you how you made it through fifteen years as a lion trainer without a single scratch ? It 's easy enough to figure out . You never got close enough . Your act is all showAnd anybody who knows anything about lions knows it . You 're still working here because all Freddie knows about lions is what they eat . NAVARRO Speaking of which , could you excuse me VLADIMIROV Does she know you hate the circus ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that includes her , because we 're not smart enough for you ? You could 've been a marine biologist . You could 've been a plastic surgeon . How many times did I have to hear what you could 've been . Well , you ca n't be either one of those things or anything else any more . You had your straight-A life and you ran off with the circus . And now all you are is a flashy old man with six mouths to feed . p. 40 NAVARRO ( Tries again . ) Speaking of which , could you  --  VLADIMIROV And if you try to take Trina away from usif you talk her into leaving the circus and going to middle-age with youif you destroy all that we have worked forif she stops flyingIf I find out that you have even touched her , I will kill you . NAVARRO Are you through ? VLADIMIROV You will-be in the cage with the cats and I will shoot you in the legs and let the cats tear you apart . You may live long enough to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NAVARRO Yeah , yeah . VLADIMIROV Or I 'll brush your hair with pepper . You wo n't even know it . Sheena will sneeze and bite your head off . NAVARRO Eva VLADIMIROV Accidents happen . NAVARRO I believe you . VLADIMIROV You 'd better . NAVARRO I also remember Count Vladimirov . VLADIMIROV You touch Trina and I will kill you . NAVARRO Poor Court Vladimirov . Shall I tell your darling Trina about the last days of the rich , old , and very foolish Count Vladimirov ? Shall I tell your precious protg and niece that her has-been aerialist goddess drugged her invalid husband and pushed him down the stairs , and then had the nerve to keep his name and his money ! p. 41 VLADIMIROV There was no money . NAVARRO I could 've told you that when you married him . Look , Eva , the guy was gon na kick off pretty soon anyway , so I do n't much care that you killed him or not  --  VLADIMIROV I was an accident and you know it ! NAVARRO  --  but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept his accent . ( Now in a different tone . ) I think I 'll tell her . VLADIMIROV She wo n't believe you . NAVARRO She believe everything I say . ( Eva picks up the starters pistol he uses in his lion-taming act . ) VLADIMIROV You 're also going to be deaf in a few years from shooting this . Does she know that ? NAVARRO It 's loaded . VLADIMIROV Do you remember how many shots you fired in the ring ? You started with five blanks . ( She fires two shots . ) Did you shoot three out there so the next one is the bullet ? Or was it two , so the next one is still a blank . Or was one so you have two more chances ? A younger man would remember . NAVARRO One . ( She fires another shot. ) p. 42 NAVARRO There 's one more blank . VLADIMIROV Or was it two ? Or was that yesterday you only shot one ? If it was two today , this next one is for real . NAVARRO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . ) You were wrong . You shot one yesterday and two today . This one will kill you . I always count . Still think you 're right ? One little squeeze ( She hands him the gun . ) NAVARRO Thank you . VLADIMIROV Do n't touch her . NAVARRO Do n't kill me . ( The door opens and Oz and Goldie enter , very upset and disturbed to find anyone in here . ) GOLDIE ( To Eva and Tony . ) Get out ! VLADIMIROV Get out ? GOLDIE You were going out . So go . TRINA What 's up ? OZ Nothing . NAVARRO Something is up all right . ( Offstage , Fred makes the intermission announcement . ) FRED ( In his spotlight . ) And that , ladies and gentlemen , brings us to the end of the first half of today 's performance of Circus Valentine . So take a few minutes , get some popcorn and a soft drink , and hurry right back for the experience of a lifetime  --  p. 43 OZ I have to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the price we pay to work here . You have to see Fred about what ? FRED ( Continuing offstage. )  --  hurry right back for the experience of a lifetime , those brilliant Siamese twins , Brad and Bill Evans , right here in the center ring , along with Grace Kelly , Ella and Elvira Esterhazy , and a whirl of other attractions . NAVARRO What 's going on ? GOLDIE It 's none of your business . FRED Ladies and Gentlemen , boys and girls . It 's intermission . ( We hear the intermission music over the continuing argument . ) VLADIMIROV Everything that happens here is our business . We are the show . NAVARRO Shut up , Eva . ( To Oz . ) How are the twins ? OZ I do n't know . NAVARRO What do you mean , you do n't know ? VLADIMIROV You did n't bring them back ? OZ No . NAVARRO You just left them down there or what ? You had something else to do or what ? You had a flat tire ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on in here ? It 's intermission . I need change for the cotton candy and people are stealing the programs and ( Now seeing how upset they are . ) What 's going on in here ? GOLDIE Get Leroy to help you , and the tent crew . Do n't worry about the programs . Just drinks and cotton candy and popcorn . You know what to do . TRINA Forget about the programs ? GOLDIE Just go . TRINA O.K. , O.K. ( She leaves . ) ( Tony turns to Oz . ) NAVARRO Tell us about the twins , Oz . GOLDIE I think we better wait for Fred . NAVARRO Oz ? OZ They did n't go bowling . There was n't any accident . NAVARRO Then where are they ? If they left us for some other show , I will personally ( Fred opens the door , sees them all , tries to get back out , but Goldie stops him . ) NAVARRO Fred . What is this ? OZ you took them to a hospital all right , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't because of any accident . p. 45 FRED They asked me not to tell . GOLDIE To tell what ? What 's wrong with them ? VLADIMIROV What do you mean , what 's wrong with them ? They 're Siamese twins ! OZ Well not for long . The surgery to separate them is scheduled for tomorrow morning . That 's why they 're in the hospital . GOLDIE Oh no . OZ Seven , tomorrow morning . Take all day , the nurse said . FRED God no . NAVARRO They ca n't do that ! OZ They would n't see me , but I found them . The hospital has the best hand surgeon in the country . That 's why they picked it . They 're trying for five fingers on each hand . Never been done , the nurse said . NAVARRO We have to stop them ! VLADIMIROV I could 've told you . I could 've told all of you . NAVARRO No you could n't either , so shut up . Now . Fred . I say we cancel the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of there . FRED We 're doing the second act . NAVARRO But the twins are the second act . p. 46 FRED Nor today , they 're not . Now what we have to do is get ourselves together and give Mr. Reeves a second act he will like even better than the twins . GOLDIE The only thing he 'd like more than the twins is if we all went out there and killed ourselves . FRED Tony can do his old springboard act . VLADIMIROV That will kill him , anyway . FRED Goldie can juggle . ( To her . ) What was that name you used to call yourself ? GOLDIE DumbbellMoron ? TRINA Mom has n't juggled for years . FRED She taught the twins to juggle , and they 're great at it . How bad can she be ? And you and Eva will do the long version of the pony act , and the clowns will do three turns instead of two and VLADIMIROV And I could try the triple . EVERYONE No . VLADIMIROV Why not ? If I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't make it ? NAVARRO Well then , only she would be history . FRED Nobody is going to be history . Not us , not the twins , and not this circus . p. 47 NAVARRO We have got to stop them from having this surgery . FRED We can do that after the show . GOLDIE We ca n't do the show while the twins are in  --  FRED If we do a second act that Mr. Reeves likes , then maybe we can still have a circus , even without the twins . If that 's how it turns out . GOLDIE Are you telling us everything , Freddie ? FRED It 's going to be O.K. The twins are going to be fine , and we 're going to be fine . VLADIMIROV The show must go on ? FRED Yes . NAVARRO Why ? FRED Because it 's our job . Because this is how it works . We are the clowns and they are the farmers , and if we make them laugh , they will feed us . NAVARRO You hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five minutes to the top of Act II . Everybody .

OUTSIDE THE MAIN TENTGoldie and Eva are standing just outside of the tent as Fred intros Goldie . GOLDIE ( Still practicing juggling . ) This is going to be ridiculous . VLADIMIROV Your juggling is n't going to keep their money in our pocket , if that 's what you mean . GOLDIE Just ridiculous ! VLADIMIROV The only way to do that is for me to try a triple . GOLDIE Now that 's really ridiculous . VLADIMIROV It is not . They 've never seen one . GOLDIE And you 've never done one . VLADIMIROV It would save the show . GOLDIE That 's all we need . Eva . The twins in the hospital , and you dead in the sawdust . VLADIMIROV The fall might not kill me . GOLDIE If you 're going to kill yourself , will you please do it sometime when I 'm not watching . VLADIMIROV I might make it , you know . GOLDIE It would n't matter . These people would n't even know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a trick ! p. 58 VLADIMIROV I 'm not scared of it , if that 's what you 're thinking . GOLDIE ( Realizes she is serious . ) Wait til this winter . Outside . There 'll be enough room for your spin . You 'll be rested . You wo n't be mad at Tony or me or Freddie or anybody . You 'll be in Florida . You 'll be home . That will make all the difference . ( Eva does n't answer . We hear Fred 's intro . ) FRED ( In his spotlight . ) And now , Ladies and Gentlemen , boys and girls , the marvelous Margobella , manipulating a myriad of rings , balls and pins . She will amaze you . She will amuse you ! Here she isMademoiselle Margobella ! ( Goldie runs on . Eva watches her begin her act . ) VLADIMIROV ( Imitating Fred 's style . ) Ladies and Gentlemen .

( He does n't say this to Eva , but rather to the air . ) TRINA It 's probably just a little twisted . You were wonderful . VLADIMIROV They booed him . TRINA They 're stupid . What do they know about acrobats ? They did n't understand what he was trying to do . VLADIMIROV Neither did he . NAVARRO I made a fool of myself . TRINA Well I thought you were terrific . I 'll kiss it . ( Tony looks away from both of them as Trina bends to kiss the ankle . ) VLADIMIROV You were a fool . NAVARRO Shut up . VLADIMIROV I never shut up . NAVARRO I know . TRINA ( Standing up . ) There now . VLADIMIROV ( To Trina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cone machine and then get dressed . ( Trina leaves. ) p. 60 VLADIMIROV ( To Tony . ) Sit down . NAVARRO Leave me alone . VLADIMIROV Your tucks were n't tight enough . What you should 've done was our old Risley act . NAVARRO With Trina ? VLADIMIROV With somebody . NAVARRO Trina does n't know it . TRINA ( Enters with ice . ) Trina does n't know what ? NAVARRO The Risley we used to do . TRINA ( Bending down . ) I did n't know you did that . That 's hard . NAVARRO Eva had the hard part . ( Eva reaches for the ice and begins to pack Tony 's ankle . ) VLADIMIROV Go get dressed Trina . ( Trina reaches for the ice . ) TRINA I 'll do it . NAVARRO Let Eva do it . TRINA Just tell me what to do . NAVARRO ( Very sharp . ) I do n't have time to teach you . I 'm hurt now . p. 61 TRINA But she hates you . NAVARRO She knows where I need the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , baby . Go watch your mother . ( Eva bends down and takes off the shawl she has been wearing . She starts to bandage Tony 's ankle as the spot comes up for Goldie 's act . ) IN THE CENTER RING GOLDIE ( Very embarrassed , but still trying to juggle . ) It 's very nice to be here . I 'm Goldie Sparrow Valentine . Is n't that silly , Mother named me Golden Sparrow . Everybody knows there are n't any golden sparrows . Well mother 's have the right to hope , I guess . I 'm not a juggler . I imagine you can see that for yourself . I 'm only out here because ( The balls all fall to the floor . ) IN THE WARDROBE TENTLights come up on Eva and Tony . She is now taking a ribbon out of her hair to tie up the bandage . This tenderness is in direct contrast with their talk . NAVARRO What am I supposed to do now ? I ca n't go into the ring with the cats like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VLADIMIROV He spent it . NAVARRO But it might be weeks before I can find another show . How am I supposed to feed the cats in the meantime ? p. 62 VLADIMIROV You could turn them loose . The police would round them up NAVARRO They 'd shoot them . VLADIMIROV Exactly . Then you would n't have to feed them . NAVARRO I could sell them to a zoo , then buy them back when I got on my feet again . VLADIMIROV Zoos already have lions . That 's how they got to be zoohaving lions already . NAVARRO I could sell them to VLADIMIROV Everybody who already wants lions already has lions . NAVARRO I 'll make some calls . VLADIMIROV To whom ? IN THE CENTER RINGGoldie struggles on . GOLDIE Mademoiselle Margobella . I knew Fred would make up some name or other , but Margobella ! Margobella ! Know where he got that ? ( Pause . ) Margobella is the name you can still read on the back of the pink plastic plates we eat off of , Miraclewear 's Margobella . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wear out .

Some plates so nice I could worry about breaking them . And while you 're at it , ( Speaking as if to some unseen benefactor . ) I 'd like some hooks on the walls for pots and pans . I ca n't hang my pots on the walls now , because every night of my life , my walls roll 100 miles down some road to some other town . And once , before I die , I 'd like to open my kitchen window and not smell horses . Is that too much ? p. 63 IN THE WARDROBE TENTEva and Tony continue . NAVARRO And I suppose you know exactly what you 're going to do ? VLADIMIROV I do . NAVARRO What ? VLADIMIROV Circus people know me . NAVARRO Who knows you ? All your boyfriends died . Their sons , no , their accountants are running their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian accents and beautiful legs . This was your last tour anyway and you know it . This was your home run , sweetheart .

VLADIMIROV They were nothing , those men . NAVARRO They were nothing . I was nothing . Everything is nothing to you . VLADIMIROV No . NAVARRO Yes . You are everything for yourself .

VLADIMIROV But you are not stupid . NAVARRO Oh no . Never been stupid . IN THE CENTER RINGGoldie continues . The crowd is booing now . GOLDIE The only thing we ownThat 's worth anything , is this tent . IN THE WARDROBE TENT ( Reeves storms up to Tony and Eva . He indicates the treatment . ) REEVES Somebody get hurt ? NAVARRO It 's nothing . REEVES Where 's Valentine ? ( Tony starts to point . ) No . Where are the twins ? VLADIMIROV ( A little threatening , but not belligerent . ) Who are you ? REEVES Name is Reeves . I own this mall . Where are the twins ? p. 65 VLADIMIROV ( Very nearly coy . ) You must be a very busy man . REEVES I can handle it . NAVARRO It 's a real nice set up you have here . REEVES Just have to know what you 're doing . Are the twins going on ? NAVARRO I hear these malls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , you make money with money . REEVES Where are the  --  VLADIMIROV ( Seeing that Reeves wants an answer . ) The twins keep pretty much to themselves . Is there anything else we could do for you ? NAVARRO Seen the show ? REEVES No . ( Reeves looks inside the tent . The crowd is laughing now . Tony and Eva are worried about that . ) NAVARRO One of the finest little circuses in the world . VLADIMIROV I would n't fly for anybody else . Fred is the best . ( Trina enters , dressed exactly like Eva for their bareback act . ) TRINA Is your ankle broken ? VLADIMIROV Trina , darling , this is Mr. Reeves . ( Trina curtsies , as the laughter continues outside. ) p. 66 IN THE CENTER RINGGoldie continues . The crowd is booing louder now . GOLDIE Fred bought this tent because he wanted to be somebody . Well this time , Fred Valentine , I want to be somebody . I 'm not some no-talent rope girl who 's afraid of heights . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm tired of secondhand , discount , giant economy-sized plastic plate cheap ! I want a house , I want a mailbox and neighbors . I want an inside telephone . ( Picking up the balls . ) I 'm sorry about this . ButI never said I could juggle . ( There is a smattering of unenthusiastic applause , and a couple of boos . Goldie leaves the spotlight without bowing . There is one final laugh from the audience , and then we hear Fred 's voice . ) FRED ( In his spotlight . ) Ladies and Gentlemen , the Marvelous , the Hilarious , Mademoiselle Margobella ! IN THE WARDROBE TENTGoldie bursts into the room , hopping mad . Eva , Tony , and Trina hold their breath as she enters . GOLDIE You 're going to be sorry , Freddie , you sunuvabitch .

I 'm in there being laughed at while you 're out here cozying up to this bozo because you think he can save you . REEVES You should n't have said that . LEROY She can say whatever she wants , buddy . GOLDIE It was n't smart . REEVES No it was n't . GOLDIE Well , I did n't get where I am today by being smart . NAVARRO Obviously . GOLDIE It 's all over anyway . Your precious twins , Mr. Reeves , your cute little Siamese freaks that you want paraded around in front of your mall so your people will spend more money in your mall , well those twins are in the hospital today .

GOLDIE ( Straightening Trina 's costume . ) I already did my clown act , buster . FRED ( Continuing offstage . ) Excitement unequaled west of Eastern Europe TRINA ( To Reeves . ) Do n't pay any attention to her . She always says stuff like that when she 's mad at daddy . Come watch our act . FRED ( In his spotlight . ) Ladies and Gentlemen , boys and girls , the enchanting Ella and the electrifying Elvira Esterhazy . ( Horse music starts up and Eva and Trina exit. ) p. 69 REEVES ( To Goldie . ) I guess you know what this means ? GOLDIE Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . REEVES That 's not what I meant . GOLDIE ( To Reeves . ) Of course it 's not what you meant . You 're going to cancel our tour . Because you do n't think enough people will spend enough money if they do n't see enough freaks . Well , you 're the freak , mister . ( Tony shakes his head in disbelief and despair . ) GOLDIE The only thing you have in this world is money . REEVES While you , on the other hand , can juggle . GOLDIE So tell me something your money does for you . REEVES Do you give away tickets to this show ? No . If people do n't have the money , they do n't see the elephant . If they do n't pay you the money , you do n't feed the elephant . You have to have money . You went out there and juggled for money . I run this mall for money and it 's the same damn thing . GOLDIE But I do n't do what I do for the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason you own this mall is to make money . REEVES Oh shit ! People like me keep the world going while people like you act like you 're doing us a favor by enjoying yourselves in it . You 'd starve to death without us . We paved your playground , little girl . We dug up the rocks and put in the swings . p. 70 GOLDIE Yeah well , your money is dead and so are you . LEROY That 's telling him . NAVARRO You 're going to shut up or I 'm going to ( Tony restrains Leroy , who is trying to get closer to Reeves and Goldie . As Reeves talks , Tony and Leroy ad-lib , Leroy determined to get loose and Tony muscling him to stay out of it . ) REEVES O.K. My money is dead and so am I. But your little show is about to be dead because that 's the price for not keeping your part of our deal . GOLDIE No twins , no show . REEVES That 's right . And when your show is gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of work and all that 's left is a worthless piece of rotten canvas , when your show is over , I 'll still have my money and my show will go on . GOLDIE Fuck off . REEVES ( Grabbing her . ) What 'd you say ? LEROY ( Breaking away from Tony . ) I told you to lay off the lady . REEVES This is no lady . Ladies do n't ( Leroy grabs Reeves , turning him around , freeing Goldie in the process. ) p. 71 LEROY Listen you ( Tony rushes over , but does n't arrive in time . ) NAVARRO Leroy ! REEVES Take your hands off me , hobo . ( Leroy throws a swift punch which knocks Reeves out cold . Goldie gasps . Tony shakes his head . And they stand in shocked silence as the equestrian act comes to an end . ) FRED ( In his spotlight . ) Did n't I say they were exhilarating ? Did n't I say they were enchanting and electrifying ? Ladies and Gentlemen , Ella and Elvira Esterhazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardwell Clowns and their hysterical hounds . NAVARRO ( Backing away from Leroy . ) Oh shit ! ( Eva and Trina run out of the tent and into the silence surrounding Reeves . ) TRINA ( Before she sees Reeves . ) Leroy , you 're supposed to clear the ring ! NAVARRO He 's not touching one more piece of this show . TRINA ( Now she sees Reeves . ) What on Earth ? GOLDIE ( To Leroy . ) Why did you hit him ? This had nothing to do with you . p. 72 TRINA ( To Leroy . ) You knocked him out ? GOLDIE Who the hell do you think you are ? LEROY Yeah , well NAVARRO Get out of here . LEROY Guess it is about time . ( To Trina . ) Guess I ca n't make it tonight , princess . TRINA Get out of here ! ( Fred rushes into the scene , passing Leroy on his way out . ) FRED I just announced the clowns . Where are they ? TRINA ( Running offstage . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Do n't ask , honey . Go on back in there . FRED And do what ? GOLDIE I do n't know . It 's your turn . ( Then turning away from him . ) Get me some water , Tony . IN THE CENTER RINGAct lighting comes up on Fred , taking him somewhat by surprise . FRED ( In act lighting . ) Oh . Yes . All right . Well . While we 're waiting for the clowns , well , maybe you wondered why my picture was n't in the souvenir program book . ( Goldie takes the water Tony brings her and begins to bathe Reeves face , holding his head. ) p. 73 FRED No , no . Let 's see . Well would anybody like to know how I keep my top hat shiny ? I brush it in a clean cloth dipped in beer , that 's how . Now , What elseuhDid you see my silver trailer out there ? That 's circus tradition , the manager 's wagon is always silver . ( Reeves comes to , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he tries to stand , resisting Goldie 's offers of help . ) FRED There 's just not much to say about me . My mother was a Fat Lady in a Freak Show . They paid her pretty well and she invested it well , and Dad gave all the money to Oz when she died and we had to have a special coffin made to carry her and it took twelve pallbearers at the funeral . She could n't stand up for the last fifteen years of her life and I bought her this hand mirror so she could see her feet . All that money she had and the only thing she 'd buy for herself was shoes . ( Reeves stands , straightens his suit , and wipes the blood from his mouth . ) FRED She had more pairs of shoes . Oz put them on for her , but if I had n't given her that mirror , she would n't have even been able to see them . She really liked that mirror , but she never looked at her face . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty , but she said she did n't want to know because she thought it would kill her if it were true , that she was pretty . ( The spotlight moves to Reeves as he walks up to Fred. ) p. 74 REEVES Ladies and Gentlemen , I hate to interrupt this FRED I 'm not finished . What are you doing ? REEVES Get out ! FRED I 'm not finished talking about my mother . They paid their money and I 'm gon na tell them  --  REEVES The management of this mall has just learned that the Siamese twins we promised you in our advertising , will not be appearing with Circus Valentine . We have , therefore , decided to return your money . FRED You ca n't do that ! That 's our money . We did the show . REEVES You may receive a cash refund in my office on the second floor of the mall . Or , you may come to the table my assistants are setting up just outside the main entrance to the tent . FRED That 's all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stub for two chances on the Honda moped being given away next Saturday at the Arvin 's Amusements Old-Fashioned Fair right here in this same location , or you may receive a free pass to the Elvis Presley Automobile Show , beginning next Sunday in the front parking lot . The Show features every car owned by Elvis on the sad day of his departure from the Earth . Sit where he sat , see the pictures of his mother framed in the door of the built-in medicine cabinet p. 75 FRED We did the show . REEVES ( Looking up as if to the light booth . ) Cut the lights on this man please . ( The light goes out on Fred . ) I apologize for disappointing you today and I take full responsibility for what has happened here . The Midtown  --  Mall deeply regrets the inconvenience we have caused you , but we hope our refund offers will convince you of our sincere desire to deal honestly with you , whether you are in our stores or enjoying one of our attractions . Thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . OUTSIDE THE MAIN TENT NAVARRO He ca n't close the show ! VLADIMIROV He already did . NAVARRO You should 've shut up , Goldie . GOLDIE You should 've held on to Leroy . VLADIMIROV Where were you Oz ? You know better than to leave the back door during the show . TRINA It 's Mother 's fault . She started it . GOLDIE You all made me sick , out there buttering him up when I came off . TRINA He 's going to keep all our money . GOLDIE He better not touch that tent . p. 76 TRINA People are taking all the programs ! VLADIMIROV He has no right to do this ! NAVARRO I should 've killed him when I had the chance . VLADIMIROV ( Starting to run into the arena . ) That 's my rigging . My rigging stays up . ( Fred catches her on his way out of the tent . ) GOLDIE I 'm calling the police . He ca n't throw us out . FRED Nobody calls nobody . GOLDIE Freddie , do something ! OZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You owe me ten more weeks . TRINA Daddy , you have to give Tony his money . FRED I have to find Reeves . I 'll be back . GOLDIE No you do n't . VLADIMIROV He ca n't see you right now . He 's giving away our money . NAVARRO This is all your fault , Valentine . It 's all your fault . TRINA Daddy did n't start the fight . NAVARRO The fight was just an accident . Reeves was going to close the show anyway cause we do n't have the twins . And Daddy made that deal , doll . ( Vicious . ) Now talk Valentine . p. 77 GOLDIE Say something , Freddie . FRED I 've told you everything I know . GOLDIE Who 's doing the surgery ? FRED I do n't know . VLADIMIROV They had to plan this . OZ You do n't just drop into town and lie down on the table . NAVARRO Tell us where they got the money , Freddie , you no good sunuvabitch , tell us where they got the money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell me where they got the money . I know where they got the money . It was our money . Tell us how they got the doctor . They do n't drive and we have n't been here before . VLADIMIROV Did n't they come here about a month ago to have some new poster pictures taken ? GOLDIE They did ! And you came with them ! FRED I came to talk to Reeves . I dropped them off at the bowling alley . OZ Reeves never saw you before today . GOLDIE So the three of you came up here OZ And saw the doctor . You did n't see Reeves and they did n't go bowling . p. 78 GOLDIE You set up the surgery and then you booked us into this town . VLADIMIROV And who paid the fee ? NAVARRO ( Screaming . ) We paid the fee ! Tell them Freddie . We paid the fee ! ( Reeves breaks into the group . ) REEVES I want this lot cleared by the morning . I want your lions gone and all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ticket booth out . And your power lines are being disconnected right now and if anybody tries to hook them back up , for any reason , I 'll have them thrown in jail . They 're coming after the tent at 7:00 and I want all of you outgone . And I do n't want to hear from you or any of your friends ever again . OZ You 're not taking that tent . GOLDIE That 's our tent , Bozo . REEVES It 's my tent . And if you signed a contract with this man , ( Indicating Fred . ) I 'd sue him if I were you . Oh , and do n't come in to use my bathrooms . There 's a gas station three blocks down . VLADIMIROV Just who do you think you are ? REEVES You set foot inside my mall and I 'll have you arrested . p. 79 NAVARRO You miserable sunuvabitch . GOLDIE Get out ! REEVES You still do n't understand , do you ? You 're the one who 's getting out . No more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to do . ( Reeves exits . ) OZ You sold my tent ? GOLDIE It was our tent . FRED It was his tent , Goldie . It was the only deal I could make , Oz . He did n't want to take us . The tent was like collateral . Against our losses . I guaranteed him we 'd make him a thousand bucks a week or he could take the tent . VLADIMIROV How could you be so stupid ? FRED I did n't have any choice . GOLDIE I want to know how you thought this was going to work out . You hocked our tent to pay for destroying our main attraction ? FRED I thought if we were all here together GOLDIE ( Nearly hysterical . ) Freddie ? How did you think we were going to get out of this ? If the operation was a success , the twins would be separated and we would lose our tent because we have no twins . But if the operation was a failure and the twins died , we would lose our tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no tent , there 's no circus . p. 80 FRED I thought they might change their minds . VLADIMIROV Their mind . FRED I thought they 'd TRINA But what about us ? NAVARRO You 're gon na do fine , Trina . We 're the ones with no place to go . We 're not going to find other shows , Fred . It 's the middle of the season , so even if we knew somebody who needed us , we would n't know where they were . And even if we knew where they were , you 've spent all our money , so we could n't get there . At our age , you 're either a star and you get by on reputation , or you 're out . We 're out . You 've destroyed what we like to think of as our lives , Fred . What are we going to do ? FRED I do n't know what you 're all going to do . I do n't know what I 'm going to do . Oz can get a lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sue me . You can all sue me , but I do n't have anything . All I really had was all of you . But I only had that as long as those boys kept on being Siamese . TRINA They did n't mind . GOLDIE That 's stupid , Trina . ( To Fred . ) Go on . FRED There really was never any reason for them to stay together . Except of course that they 'd always been that way . p. 81 VLADIMIROV Are you telling us this was your idea ? FRED The operation is tricky , of course , and maybe they 'll each lose partial mobility in one hand , but I heard about this surgeon in town here NAVARRO ( Interrupting . ) You 've lost your mind , Fred . Lost your mind . FRED I do n't think so . I told the twins about the surgeon and asked them what they thought . And do you know what they said ? They said the only reason they were staying together was because of me . Because I was kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never laughed at them . Because I took them out of the sideshow and Goldie taught them to juggle . Because we were a show . They stayed together all this time because of us ! OZ Oh man . NAVARRO What is that supposed to mean ? FRED Well I was n't about to be the reason that they stayed together . And ( To Goldie . ) I do n't know how I thought we 'd get out of this . I did n't think about it . It did n't seem important . What I did for them , that seems important . I think it 's the only important thing I ever did and if it means I never see any of you again , well , I 'll miss you . NAVARRO ( Slowly . ) It was your idea . You found the surgeon . You told the twins about it and brought them up here for the consultation . You scheduled the surgery and booked us into this town . You checked them into the hospital this morning and you took every penny any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors ' fee . p. 82 FRED Yes . NAVARRO And you think they 're gon na like what you 've done to them ? They 've been together for twenty-five years . Are they supposed to break up just because you 've decided they should n't be freaks anymore ? How will they earn a living now ? Sure , they can juggle , but they only know how to do it Siamese . They 'll never perform again . That 's a pretty heavy decision to make for somebody else , Freddie . OZ Easy , Tony . FRED I wanted them to have a choice . NAVARRO You made it for them , Fred . It was simply not acceptable to you that they should remainthey way they were . FRED No , it was n't . And I think they felt the same way . GOLDIE You think . TRINA Wow . VLADIMIROV Well , I say FRED ( Still calm . ) Yes ? VLADIMIROV Well , I say , ' Good for you , Freddie . OZ ( After a while . ) Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't ask us , Freddie . We 'd still be arguing about it , and it 's really pretty simple after all . How could we live on them for so long . They 'll do just fine , Tony . They 'll be normal people and that 'll be just fine . p. 83 TRINA But what are we going to do ? Are we going to be fine ? ( There is a moment . ) OZ Of course we are . What did you think , we were going to starve to death because we lost our tent ? GOLDIE We could n't play towns like this . OZ Could n't even play fairs until we got another tent . GOLDIE ( To Fred . ) Do we still have the trucks ? FRED We 'd have to sell one to repair the others . OZ And sell another one to feed the animals . VLADIMIROV The animals have to go . We ca n't afford them . NAVARRO So what do we have ? An aerialist and a fortune-teller ? That 's not a show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an elephant ? OZ We have an elephant . GOLDIE We 'll keep the animals . OZ We need some new acts . Make some calls . FRED We could n't pay them . TRINA I bet some newspaper would pay us for the twins ' story . They could go on talk shows . p. 84 NAVARRO No . TRINA It would help them get a new start , you know ? Make them some money . NAVARRO Only freaks go on talk shows . They want to stop being freaks . That 's why they 're having the operation . We 're the ones who ought to go on talk shows . We actually want to stay freaks . FRED There 's an amusement park , here , down in the west end . They have a pavilion , we could set up there . GOLDIE An amusement park ? OZ We 'll put everything in one truck . Set up at big gas stations on the turn pikes , or state parks . Yeah , state parks is better . VLADIMIROV State parks ? Without the tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairs . We can sell the stake puller and sell the generator truck . Keep the microphones and hook up to their system . Strip the concessions truck cause they 'll already have them . OZ The lions wo n't move in with Grace Kelly if that 's what you 're about to say . FRED Well , they might not like it , but we could do it . And the ponies too , all in the bull truck . GOLDIE And we all sleep in the office trailer ? p. 85 FRED And we 'll go back to county fairs where we know people . VLADIMIROV Who 've seen us already . NAVARRO Who 'll wonder what happened to our tent . GOLDIE And where , since there 's no tent , everybody can see the show so there 's no point in selling tickets . FRED So we have to play inside somewhere . VLADIMIROV Like where ? FRED Like industrial shows , I guess . Mobile home shows , Lawn and Patio shows , Recreational Vehicle shows . Three or four half hour spots a day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , You know , Ladies ' Entertainment things at insurance conventions . NAVARRO Birthday Parties TRINA It might not be so bad . GOLDIE Trapeze in the backyard and lions in the garage ? Birthday parties ? It would be the end . ( There is a long moment . ) GOLDIE It is the end . NAVARRO ( Very calmly . ) Damn television . Damn Ringling and spaceships . Damn electric corn poppers and Wild Kingdom and zoos and damn me . It 's alright about the twins , Freddie , I just wish it was 1910. p. 86 GOLDIE ( After a while . ) Will the trucks get us home , Freddie ? ( Freddie does n't answer . There is dead silence . Finally , Oz takes the bottle Trina has given him earlier , out of his back pocket . He takes off the top and takes a drink . ) OZ Give me your gun , Tony . VLADIMIROV Here . ( Hands it to him , from the pocket of her bathrobe . ) OZ All right , Fred . TRINA Oz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GOLDIE Oz . This is stupid . ( Oz sights down the pistol , aiming at Fred . ) FRED Ready . OZ Aim . ( Takes his stance . ) I 've been thinking about the tent . FRED Yeah ? ( Oz uses the tip of the pistol to push his hat back on his head . A gesture he has seen in the movies sometime . He smiles . ) OZ I think we should spread the tent out in the front parking lot , and drive the stake puller and the concessions truck and the generator truck and the cookhouse up on it . And take the keys with us . And Mr. Reeves can have his tent if he can figure out how to get it out from under 95,000 pounds of beat-up trucks . ( Oz hands the gun to Tony . Tony looks at it a moment . He uses it for some other he-man gesture , as he thinks. ) p. 87 NAVARRO Yeah . Maybe I 'll just leave my lions in the mall . GOLDIE Be fair , now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as a little warning , you know . NAVARRO Happy to . Be happy to . What do we do about the rather large amount of elephant shit out there ? OZ What do you mean ? I think it 's real attractive right where it is . NAVARRO So . We go see the twins and come back and stage our little going away party , and then we 'll just blow this old show . VLADIMIROV There is , however , one last act in this circus . ( Eva takes off her bathrobe , and walks away from them all , back into the tent . The others chase her . ) TRINA Where 's she going . GOLDIE To try the triple . TRINA She would n't . NAVARRO Come on , Eva . Stop this . FRED What the hell ? IN THE CENTER RINGTony gets to her first . NAVARRO Just ca n't be out of the spotlight , can you . Not even now . VLADIMIROV Do n't touch me . ( She starts walking toward the rope ladder. ) p. 88 OZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Stops and turns around . ) I 'm going to do a triple . Somebody can catch me , or you can all just stand there and watch . I really do n't care . TRINA Mother ! ( Fred , Oz , and Tony exchange glances . Then Tony moves . ) NAVARRO I 'll catch her . TRINA You hurt your ankle . You 'll fall too . I 'll do it . GOLDIE She 's my sister . I 'm going . FRED You have n't flown for years . You 'll go down with her . GOLDIE She 's my sister . I want to be the NAVARRO The last one to touch her alive ? Thanks . I 'll do it . Trina does n't know the timing . And your fear of heights is n't going to disappear just to save your sister 's life . I 'll catch her up there . And if I miss , well , you catch her down here . ( Goldie slaps him and heads for the rope ladder at the side of the ring . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Get up here , Goldie . TRINA ( In near hysterics . ) She 'll kill herself . p. 89 NAVARRO Eva ! OZ ( Catching Tony as he tries to run after Eva . ) Let her go . Tony . ( Tony drops to his knees , he would pray if he could close his eyes or if he believed it would help . ) OZ Well , come on , Valentine . Run this show . ( Fred straightens his coat , puts on his top hat and picks up a microphone . The lights dim and there is one spotlight on Eva , at the top of the ladder , and another one on Goldie , climbing her ladder . The others wait below , quite afraid for them , but quite aware that she has the right to do this . Oz holds Trina . ) OZ She knows what she 's doing , honey . TRINA She did it in practice , she told me . FRED ( A drum roll starts . ) Ladies and Gentlemen , when a performer attempts the dreaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death itself . As her hands release the trapeze , Eva Sparrow 's tiny body will be traveling at 60 miles and hour . She will tuck and spin , once , twiceBy now she is nearly unconscious and only as she straightens out at the end of the third somersault will her brain fight back the blackness for one desperate stretch toward the catcher 's hands . She can not see the catcher 's hands for her eyes will not focus at such speeds . Those hands , that life giving lock , arm in arm , simply must be there . Their wrists must slap . Their fingers close around each other and hold . There is no second chance with the triple . p. 90 AT THE TOP OF THE TENT VLADIMIROV Are you ready ? GOLDIE Are you scared ? FRED So now , directing your attention to the very top of the Big Top , Ladies and Gentlemen , the most daring , the most beautiful , the most graceful aerial genius in the world today . Performing the triple somersault from the flying trapeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( The drum roll peaks , Eva and Goldie raise their hands in a salute . The trapeze , previously unseen , swings toward Eva . She grasps it with both hands and the lights hold on the sisters . ) VLADIMIROV What are you doing up here ? GOLDIE What do you think I 'm doing ? Talking you down . VLADIMIROV ( After a moment . ) So talk . GOLDIE It 's a pretty short speech , Eva . It 's either die or go on . VLADIMIROV I think it 's pretty much the same thing . GOLDIE It is not and you know it . For one thing , if you die , you wo n't have me to feel superior to . VLADIMIROV I envy you . GOLDIE I know that . Jesus it 's scary up here . Can we go down now ? I mean , you can jump if you want to , but you will really miss me . ( Goldie starts down the ladder . ) ( Eva calls after her. ) p. 91 VLADIMIROV I hate you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladder . ) VLADIMIROV You do not . GOLDIE What do you know ? ( Lights comes up on the group gathered below . And as the familiar argument begins , Oz and Fred start to argue , and Tony and Trina begin to argue . ) FRED You should 've taken down her rigging already . You knew she try something like this . OZ Yeah , well , I thought maybe you sold it . TRINA You do n't even like the circus , do you ? NAVARRO I do n't no . I only like the costumes . TRINA Daddy . Did you hear what he said . ( By now Goldie and Eva are down , and they turn and exit without ever looking at the others . The others follow them offstage , arguing , and we have )
