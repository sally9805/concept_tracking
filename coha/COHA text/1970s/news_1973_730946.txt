txt To most people it probably sounds crazy , giving up a powerful scat in the United States Senate to live a subsistencelevel life as a religious lay worker . But when Sen. Harold Hughes ID. , lad talks about it , it all seems to make sense He is on his back on a motel room bed , a heavy hear of a man . with his barrel chest heaving thru his open sport shirt . AL 5t , the senator Iron Iowa , outspoken critic of the Nixon administration , the Viet Nam War , and the secret Cam . hodian bombing , is not like most people . Last . Thursday . when he announced he would not run for reelection in 1974 he proved-e . It has been almost 20 years since Hughes , the alcoholic trucker , took the pistol away from his head and knelt down to pray . " IT WAS NOT a very elegant prayer . I just said : ? Help me . God . I ca n't help myself . ' I told Him that if lie helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hughes is saying . The path of his life after that led first to the Iowa Commerce Commission , which he headed , then to three successive terms in the governor 's mansion , and in 1910 to the U. S. Senate . It was a meteoric ascent for a " swearing , sweating , cxdrunk Methodist , " as he puts it who fought for liberalized liquor and narcotics laws and endorsed Eugene McCarthy in Republican Iowa , He lights a ciga.01. and tries to explain why he is giving i all up . " I suppose most people it America think that a man win has gotten power would novel give it up . Well , I can . " IT DEFIES reason and ra tionality , and I expect I 'll b I aughed at . ridiculed , ant maybe rejected . hut I 'll be do ing something more important " The problems of the work are more spiritual than the . arc legislative , and love is th strongest weapon in existence Man is n't going to change jus by changing laws . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second cig arct and has assumed a semi lot 's position on the bed . " I committed my life t Christ . 20 years ago , and I gc a warm feeling in my heart just . like John Wesley I founde or 37 Sedgwick , two blocks east . of the . Methodist denomination . I 've tried to - uphold that commitment every day ; and I never have apologized for it . " When I get up every morning , one of the first things I do is pray . And I 've prayed , and I know I can do more working as a layman with the International Christian Leadership and the Fellowship Foundation of Washington . " IT 'S NOT a question of whether I 've done good work . I 've gotten major legislation passed and made exposes like the secret bombings in Cambodia . Without a doubt , support has grown in Iowa and financially we Iowa Democrats ) are doing very well . " But life is an eternity , and I do n't expect to die . I can do more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline of what he will do , only that whatever work he does will be supported by contributions . " Material things and power are not important in eternity . " He talks in general terms of prayer meetings with leaders of other nations . " I believe we can solve international conflicts easier thru a common belief in God or a creator , whether he be Christian , Jewish , , Hindu , or other . " I have not been rejected in Russia and hopefully wo n't be in China . If they preach the religion of Communism , I can preach God . " HE ALSO SAYS he will continue to work with alcoholism and narcotics addiction . " I still have faith in all the causes I have supported . " As he asks an aide to get him a soft drink , he adds : " Nobody criticized Schweitzer Albert Schweitzer , medical missionary for c h a ngi n g . Someone has to lead the way . Someone has to try . " Politics is a noble profes-sion , sion , despite examples like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the noblest . " There is a cause even greater , " and he is speaking softly now . " In the next few productive years , I want to express my God and I do not apologize for that . "
