When Richard Nixon turned over the reins of Government to Gerald Ford last week , the U.S. business community - long filled with fervent Nixon supporters-burst into a prolonged round of applause . It was a reaction of relief rather than celebration . A long-threatening cloud of uncertainty had been suddenly and dramatically blown away . Executives were infused with hope that public faith in White House leadership , and thus Government management of a sorely troubled economy , now stood at least a chance of being rekindled . " This is the best thing that could happen at the present time , " says George Strichman , chairman of Colt Industries , a huge conglomerate . " There will be a mood of release , a feeling of Thank God , let 's get going . ' " Charles W. Moore , research director of William C. Roney &; Co. , a Michigan brokerage house , adds , " Any change has to be an improvement over the present . " <P> Persistent Problems . But the relief was tempered by a realization that the transfer of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistent problems of rampant inflation , sky-high interest rates and declining output . Both sides of the mood were successively illustrated on Wall Street , where the Nixon years have been mostly bearish ; though the Dow Jones industrial average hit its alltime high of 1052 in January 1973 , at the beginning of last week it stood 180 points below its level on Nixon 's Inauguration Day in 1969 . In the first three days of last week , the Dow shot up 45 points in anticipation of Nixon 's resignation . Then it dropped 20 points Thursday and Friday , to close the week at 777 . One reason : an explosive rise in wholesale prices ( see box next page ) that gave fresh evidence of how difficult inflation will be to defeat . But brokers widely feel that the long-oversold stock market is about to enjoy at least a short-term psychological rise that might push the Dow to 830 or 850 before heavy profit taking pulls it back . <P> Outside Wall Street , the lifting of uncertainty could spur some new spending by both consumers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the President 's problems " have to do with selling cars , " but added that " generally speaking , there is a lack of confidence on the part of the consumers in this country , and we believe that it has affected car sales in 1974 . We would hope this confidence could be rebuilt . " Chairman Henry Walker Jr. , of the Honolulu-based Amfac , Inc. , says that , " with Nixon safely out of the way , " his company plans to move ahead on delayed plans to expand food-processing plants in Alaska and on the West Coast . <P> European government officials hope that another quick result of Nixon 's resignation will be Senate passage of a bill giving the White House new authority to negotiate a lowering of trade barriers . That would enable a round of world trade talks to get under way . An impeachment trial in the Senate could well have killed all chances for passage of the trade bill this year , and the global negotiations then probably would have been scrapped .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
