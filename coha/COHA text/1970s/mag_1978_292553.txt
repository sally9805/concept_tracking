IS SATAN DEAD ? This stark headline on the cover of London 's prestigious Economist was typical of the foreign press reaction to the Jonestown massacre . As so often happens in moments of great American triumph or tragedy , the world press gasped , grimaced and then gushed forth explanations . Several foreign weeklies published long stories on both the deaths of 911 Peoples Temple members and on the general phenomenon of cults in the U.S. Surprisingly , only the Communist press used Jonestown as an occasion for lashing at U.S. society as a whole . <P> The Economist struck the most sobering note . Attributing the rise of modern cults to the decline of traditional religious belief among educated people , the weekly observed : " What happened in Jonestown , Guyana , is a ghoulish cautionary tale for these people who , in these differing ways , are seeking God in a secular world . In that search for God , it is all too easy to blunder into the arms of Satan instead . " Added the Vatican news paper L'Osservatore Romano : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " West Germany 's Stuttgarter Zeitung philosophized less cosmically : " It was not just a symptom of America or its system 's shortcomings . Mystic sects and pseudoreligious groups exist in this part of the world as well and in worrisome numbers . The Jonestown deaths pose the vital question of whether in our modern way of life our institutions provide a sense of sufficient stability . " Commented Tokyo 's daily Asahi Shimbun : " The Guyana incident is a ghastly reminder of how fanaticism born of the contradictions of modern society can destroy human beings . " <P> <P> Inevitably , the peculiarly American and Californian ambience caught the eye of many foreign observers . California , noted the Statesman of India with considerable accuracy , is " the home of a hundred strange cults from the merely dotty to the disgusting . " A reflection along similar lines prompted Columnist Mustafa Amin of Egypt 's al Akhbar to wonder why Jones had not been stopped earlier by the police or the CIA . Yet France 's daily Le Monde , which is frequently critical of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper : " It would have been inconceivable , and without doubt unrealizable on the victims ' own soil , with or without their consent . It was necessary to uproot them , to transport them to the heart of the jungle , to transform them into prisoners of a delirious faith in a messiah , who in the end would give free rein to his instincts for domination and death for them to become self-destructive robots . " Perhaps reflecting a recent , antileftist trend among French intellectuals , the weekly Le Nouvel Observateur thought that the massacre epitomized " the insanity of totalitarianism in the guise of the clerical spirit . " <P> For Moscow , by contrast , the story was , as Pravda put it , " one more page illustrating the tragic fate of American dissidents who could not find a place for themselves in America . " The Soviets made no martyr of Jones , however , describing him as " a skillful , cynical operator who cannily took advantage of the massive disillusionment of Americans with their government and the whole American way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
