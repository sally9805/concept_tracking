THE B. F. GOODRICH COMPANY is what business magazines like to refer to as " a major Anaern corporation . " It has operations in a dozen tes and as many foreign countries ; and of se far-flung facilities , the Goodrich plant at ) y , Ohio , is not the most imposing . It is a all , one-story building , once used to mannLure airplanes . Set in the grassy flatlands of it-central Ohio , it employs only about six hund people . Nevertheless , it is one of the three test manufacturers of aircraft wheels and kes , a leader in a most profitable industry . ) drich wheels and brakes support such wells atn planes as the F111 , the C5A , the Boeing , the XB70 , and many others . : ontracts for aircraft wheels and brakes often into millions of dollars , and ordinarily a con-t with a total value of less than $70,000 , igh welcome , would not create any special of joy in the hearts of Goodrich sales person-But purchase order P-237138 ? issued on e. 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 202 brake assemblies for a new Force plane at a total price of $69,417 ? was ived by Goodrich with considerable glee . there was good reason . Some ten years pre-sly , Goodrich had built a brake for LTV that to say the least , considerably less than a ing success . The brake had not lived up to Irich 's promises , and after experiencing con -- able difficulty , LTV had written off Good-as a source of brakes . Since that time , lrich salesmen had been unable to sell so a as a shot of brake fluid to LTV . So in 1967 , LTV requested bids on wheels and brakes le new A7D light attack aircraft it proposed Ind for the Air Force , Goodrich submitted a hat was absurdly low , so low that LTV could in all prudence , turn it down . iodrich had , in industry parlance , " bought he business . " The company did not expect ske a profit on the initial deal ; it was pre-1 , if necessary , to lose money . But aircraft s are not something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a particular at , and once an aircraft manufacturer buys ke , he is forced to purchase all replacement from the brake manufacturer . The $70,000 that Goodrich would get for making the brake would be a drop in the bucket when compared with the cost of the linings and other parts the Air Force would have to buy from Goodrich during the lifetime of the aircraft . There was another factor , besides the lo* hid , that had undoubtedly influenced LTV . All aircraft brakes made today are of the disk type , and the bid submitted by Goodrich called for a relatively small brake , one containing four disks and weighing only 106 pounds . The weight of any aircraft part is extremely important : the lighter a part is , the heavier the plane 's payload can be . 1 " 11HE BRAKE WAS DESIGNED by one of Good ' rich 's most capable engineers , John Warren . A tall , lanky , blond graduate of Purdue , Warren had come from the Chrysler Corporation seven years before and had become adept at aircraft brake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper that exploded whenever anyone ventured to offer criticism of his work , no matter how small . Oni these occasions , Warren would turn red in the face , often throwing or slamming something and then stalking from the scene . As his coworkers learned the consequences of criticizing him , they did so less and less readily , and when he submitted his preliminary design for the A7D brake , it was accepted without question . Warren was named project engineer for the A7D , and he , in turn , assigned the task of producing the final production design to a newcomer to the Goodrich engineering stable , Searle Lawson- Just turned twenty-six , Lawson had been out of the Northrop Institute of Technology only one year when he came to Goodrich in January 1967 . He had been assigned to various " paper projects " to break him in , and after several months spent reviewing statistics and old brake designs , he was beginning to fret at the lack of challenge . When told he was being assigned to his first " real " project , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The major portion of the design had already been completed by Warren , and major subassemblies for the brake had already been ordered from Goodrich suppliers . Naturally , however , before Goodrich could start making the brakes on a production basis , much testing would have to be done . Lawson would have to determine the best materials to use for the linings and discover what minor adjustments in the design would have to be made . Then , after the preliminary testing and after the brake was judged ready for production , one whole brake assembly would undergo a series of grueling , simulated braking stops and other severe trials called qualification tests . These tests are required by the military , which gives very detailed specifications on how they are to be conducted , the criteria for failure , and so on . They are performed in the Goodrich plant 's test laboratory , where huge machines called dynamometers can simulate the weight and speed of almost any aircraft . A dismal beginning S EARLE LAWSON WAS WELL AWARE that much work had to be done before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that LTV had set the last two weeks in June 1968 as the starting dates for flight tests . So he decided to begin testing immediately . Goodrich 's suppliers had not yet delivered the brake housing and other parts , but the brake disks had arrived , and using the housing from a brake similar in size and weight to the A7D brake , Lawson built a prototype . The prototype was installed in a test wheel and placed on one of the big dynamometers in the plant 's test laboratory . Lawson began a series of tests . " landing " the wheel and brake at the A7D 's landing speed and braking it to a stop . The main purpose of these preliminary tests was to learn what temperatures would develop within the brake during the simulated stops and to evaluate lining materials tentatively- selected for use . During a normal aircraft landing the temperatures inside the brake may reach 1,000 degrees , and occasionally a bit higher . During Lawson 's first simulated landings , the temperature of his prototype brake reached 1,500 degrees . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metal and lining material as the temperature reached its peak . After a few such stops , the brake was dismantled and the linings were found to be almost completely disintegrated . Lawson chalked this first failure up to chance and , ordering new lining materials , tried again . The second attempt was a repeat of the first . The brake became extremely hot , causing the lining materials to crumble into dust . After the third such failure , Lawson , inexperienced though he was , knew that the fault lay not in defective parts or unsuitable lining material but in the basic design of the brake itself . Ignoring Warren 's original computations , Lav son made his own , and it did n't take him long t discover where the trouble lay ? the brake wz , too small . There simply was not enough surfac area on the disks to stop the aircraft withot generating the excessive heat that caused th linings to fail . The answer to the problem was obvious , bt far from simple ? the four-disk brake would hay to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would have to be developed . The implic ; tions were not lust on Lawson . Such a step wool require junking the four-disk-brake subassen blies , many of which had now begun to arriv from the various suppliers . It would also ' nee several weeks of preliminary design and testir and many more weeks of waiting while the su pliers made and delivered the new subassemblie Yet , several weeks had already gone by sin . LTV 's order had arrived , and the date for d livery of the first production brakes for flig testing was only a few months away . Although John Warren had more or less turn . the A7D over to Lawson , he knew of the diffici ties Lawson had been experiencing . He had sured the young engineer that the problem volved around getting the right kind of lini : material . Once that was found , he said , the di : culties would end . Despite the evidence of the abortive tests a Lawson 's careful computations , Warren reject the suggestion that the four-disk brake was light for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told LTV , in rather glowing terms , tl the preliminary tests on the A7D brake were vi successful . Indeed , Warren 's superiors were aware at this time of the troubles on the bra It would have been difficult for Warren to adt not only that he had made a serious error in calculations and original design but that mistakes had been caught by a green kid , bar out of college . Warren 's reaction to a five-disk brake was unexpected by Lawson , and , seeing that the fc disk brake was not to be abandoned so easily . took his calculations and dismal test results step up the corporate ladder . T GOODRICH , THE MAN WHO SUPERVISES engineers working on projects slated production is called , predictably , the proj. manager . The job was held by a short , chul bald man named Robert Sink . Some fift years before , Sink had begun working at Gc rich as a lowly draftsman . Slowly , he worked way up . Despite his geniality , Sink was nei respected nor liked by the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not improve their feelings toward him . possessed only a high-school diploma , an quite naturally rankled those who had 46 through years of college to be commanded by a man whom they considered their intellectual inferior . But , though Sink had no college training , he had something even more useful : a fine work-in ? . knowledge of company politics . Puffing on a Meerschaum pipe . Sink listened gravely as young Lawson confided his fears about : he four-disk brake . Then he examined Lawson 's alculations and the results of the abortive tests . Despite the fact that he was not a qualified engineer . in the strictest sense of the word , it must crtainly have been obvious to Sink that Law , on 's calculations were correct and that a fourlisk brake would never work on the A7D . But other things of equal importance were Iso obvious . First , to concede that Lawson 's calulations were correct would also mean concedng that Warren 's calculations were incorrect . is projects manager , not only was he responsible or Warren 's activities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to admit that e had erred in trusting Warren 's judgment . It Iso meant that , as projects manager , it would be e who would have to explain the whole messy tuation to the Goodrich hierarchy , not only at ' roy but possibly on the corporate level at Goodch 's Akron offices . And having taken Warren 's 1 ( 1p-tient of the four-disk brake at face value , e had assured LTV , not once but several times , tat about all there was left to do on the brake as pack it in a crate and ship it out the door . There 's really no problem at all , he told Law- ) n . After all , Warren was an experienced en-I A4WSON WAS FAR FROM CONVINCED , but without the support of his superiors there was little he could do except keep on testing . By now , housings for the four-disk brake had begun to arrive at the plant , and Lawson was able to build a production model of the brake and begin the formal qualification tests demanded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tests on the prototype had . Terrific heat developed within the brakes , and after a few short , simulated stops the linings crumbled . A new type of lining material was ordered and once again an attempt to qualify the brake was made . Again , failure . Experts were called in from lining manufacturers , and new lining " mixes " were tried , always with the same result . Failure . It was now the last week in March 1968 , and flight tests were scheduled to begin in seventy days . Twelve separate attempts had been made to qualify the brake , and all had failed . It was no longer possible for anyone to ignore the glaring truth that the brake was a dismal failure and that nothing short of a major design change could ever make it work . On April 4 , the thirteenth attempt at qualifica- tion was begun . This time no attempt was made to conduct the tests by the methods and techniques spelled out in the military specifications . Regardless of how it had to be done , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty simulated stops . Fans were set up to provide special cooling . Instead of maintaining pressure on the brake until the test wheel had come to a complete stop , the pressure was reduced when the wheel had decelerated to around 15 mph , allowing it to ' coast " to a stop . After each stop , the brake was disassembled and carefully cleaned , and after some of the stops , internal brake parts were machined in order to remove warp and other disfigurations caused by the high heat . By these and other methods , all clearly contrary to the techniques established by the military specifications , the brake was coaxed through the fifty stops . But even using these methods , the brake could not meet all the requirements . On one stop the wheel rolled for a distance of 16,000 feet , or over three miles , before the brake could bring it to a stop . The normal distance required for such a stop was around 3,500 feet . Nursing it through CIN APRIL 11 , THE DAY the thirteenth test was V/ completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had worked in the Goodrich test laboratory for five years , starting first as an instrumentation engineer , then later becoming a data analyst and technical writer . As part of my duties , I analyzed the reams and reams of instrumentation data that came from the many testing machines in the lab , then transcribed all of it to a more usable form for the engineering department . When a new-type brake had successfully completed the required qualification tests , I would issue a formal qualification report . Qualification reports are an accumulation of all the data and test logs compiled during the qualification tests and are documentary proof that a brake has met all the requirements established by the military specifications and is therefore presumed safe for flight testing . Before actual flight tests are conducted on a brake , qualification reports have to be delivered to the customer and to various government officials . On April 11 , I was looking over the data from the latest A7D test , and I noticed that many irregularities in testing methods had been noted on the test logs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with conducting tests in any manner desired , so long as the test was for research purposes only . But qualification test methods are clearly delineated by the military , and I knew that this test had been a formal qualification at tempt . One particular notation on the test lop caught my eye . For some of the stops , the instru. ment that recorded the brake pressure had beer deliberately miscalibrated so that , while the brake pressure used during the stops was re ? corded as 1,000 psi ( pounds per square inch ) ? the maximum pressure that would be available on the A7D aircraft ? the pressure had actually been 1,100 psi . I showed the test logs to the test tab supervisor . Ralph Gretzinger. who said he had learned from the technician who had miscalibrated the instru ment that he had been asked to do so by Lawson Lawson , said Gretzinger , readily admitted ask ing for the miscalibration , saying he had beet told to do so by Sink . I asked Gretzinger why anyone would want n miscalibrate the data-recording instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he snorted . " Tha brake is a failure . It 's way too small for the job and they 're not ever going to get it to work They 're getting desperate , and instead of scrag ping the damned thing and starting over , they fig ure they can horse around down here in the la and qualify it that way . " An expert engineer , Gretzinger had been re sponsible for several innovations in brake desigr It was be who had invented the unique brak system used on the famous XB70 . " If you want t find out what 's going on , " said Gretzinger , " as Lawson ; he 'll tell you . " Curious , I did ask Lawson the next time I came into the lab . He seemed eager to discuss t1A7D and gave me the history of his months 4 frustrating efforts to get Warren and Sink I change the brake design . " I just ca n't belies this is really happening , " said Lawson , shakir his head slowly . " This is n't engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Back in school thought that when you were an engineer , y ( tried to do your best , no matter what it cost . B this is something else . " He sat across the desk from me , his ch propped in his hand . " Just wait , " he warne " You 'll get a chance to see what I 'm talkie about . You 're going to get in the act too , 1 cause I 've already had the word that we 're goi : to make one more attempt to qualify the brat and that 's it . Win or lose , we 're going to issue qualification report : " I reminded him that a qualification rep ( could be issued only after a brake had succe fully met all military requirements , and the , fore , unless the next qualification attempt wai success , no report would be issued . " You 'll find out , " retorted Lawson . " I ss already told that regardless of what the braf does on test , it 's going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those exact words at a ci fcrence with Sink and Russell Van Horn . This was the first indication that Sink brought his boss , Van Horn , into the mess . 98 though Van Horn , as manager of the design engineering section , was responsible for the entire department , he was not necessarily familiar with all phases of every project . and it was not uncommon for those under him to exercise the **34;2820;TOOLONG philosophy . If he was aware of the full extent of the A7D situation , it meant that Sink had decided not only to call for help but to look toward that moment when blame must be borne and , if possible , shared . Also , if Van Horn had said , " regardless of what the brake does on test , it 's going to be qualified . " then it could only mean that , if necessary , a false qualification report would be issued . I discussed this possibility with Gretzinger , and ae assured me that under no circumstances would such a report ever be issued . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them one , but we 'll tell it just like it is , " he leclared emphatically . " No false data or false deports are going to come out of this lab . " O N MAY 2 , 1968 , THE FOURTEENTH and final at- tempt to qualify the brake was begun . Al-hough the same improper methods used to nurse he brake through the previous tests were emdoyed , it soon became obvious that this too auuld end in failure . When the tests were about half completed , Awson asked if I would start preparing the arious engineering curves and graphic displays aat were normally incorporated in a qualifica.on report . I flatly refused to have anything to do ' ith the matter and immediately told Gretzinger hat I had been asked to do . He was furious and peated his previous declaration that under no ircumstances would any false data or other mat-a-be issued from the lab . " I 'm going to get this settled right now , once id for all , " he declared . " I 'm going to see Line Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the test lab was a irt and find out just how far this thing is going go ! " He stormed out of the room . In about an hour , he returned and called me to s desk . He sat silently for a few moments , then uttered , half to himself , " I wonder what the 11 they 'd do if I just quit ? " I did n't answer and did n't ask him what he meant . I knew . He had ! en beaten down . He had reached the point ' ten the decision had to be made . Defy them w while there was still time ? or knuckle under , ll out . " You know , " he went on uncertainly , looking wn at his desk , " I 've been an engineer for a ig time , and I 've always believed that ethics d integrity were every bit as important as ? orems and formulas , and never once has any1.ig happened to change my beliefs . Now this ... I 've got two sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " His voice trailed off . He sat for a few more minutes , then , looking over the top of his glasses , said hoarsely , " Well , it looks like we 're licked . The way it stands now , we 're to go ahead and prepare the data and other things for the graphic presentation in the report , and when we 're finished , someone upstairs will actually write the report . " After all , " he continued , " we 're just drawing some curves , and what happens to them after they leave here ? well , we 're not responsible for that . " I WAS N'T AT ALL SATISFIED with the situation and decided that I too would discuss the matter with Russell Line , the senior executive in our section . Tall , powerfully built , his teeth flashing white , his face tanned to a coffee-brown by a daily stint with a sunlamp , Line looked and acted every inch the executive . He had been transferred from the Akron offices some two years previously , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those of us who worked under him . He listened sympathetically while I explained how I felt about the A7D situation , and when I had finished , he asked me what I wanted him to do about it . I said that as employees of the Goodrich Company we had a responsibility to protect the company and its reputation if at all possible . I said I was certain that officers on the corporate level would never knowingly allow such tactics as had been employed on the A7D . " I agree with you , " he remarked , " but I still want to know what you want me to do about it . " I suggested that in all probability the chief engineer at the Troy plant , II . C. " Bud " Sunder-man , was unaware of the A7D problem and that he , Line , could tell him what was going on . Line laughed , good-humoredly . " Sure , I could , but I 'm not going to . Bud probably already knows about this thing anyway , and if he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to tell him . " " But why ? " " Because it 's none of my business , and it 's none of yours . I learned a long time ago not to worry about things over which I had no control . I have no control over this . " I was n't satisfied with this answer , and I asked him if his conscience would n't bother him if , say , during flight tests on the brake , something should happen resulting in death or injury to the test pilot . " Look , " he said , becoming somewhat exasperated , " I just told you I have no control over this . Why should my conscience bother me ? " His voice took on a quiet , soothing tone as he continued . " You 're just getting all upset over this thing for nothing . I just do as I 'm told , and I 'd advise you to do the same . " I made no attempt to rationalize what I had been asked to do . It made no difference who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual falsification would be by misleading numbers or misleading words . Whether by acts of commission or omission , all of us who contributed to the fraud would be guilty . The only question left for me to decide was whether or not I would become a party to the fraud . Before coming to Goodrich in 1963 , I had held a variety of jobs , each a little more pleasant , a little more rewarding than the last . At forty-two , with seven children , I had decided that the Goodrich Company would probably be my " home " for the rest of my working life . The job paid well . it was pleasant and challenging , and the future looked reasonably bright . My wife and I had bought a home and we were ready to settle down into a comfortable , middle-age , middle-class rut . If I refused to take part in the A7D fraud , I would have either to resign or be fired . The report would be written by someone anyway , but I would have the satisfaction of knowing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't paid with personal satisfaction , nor house payments with ethical principles . I made my decision . The next morning , I telephoned Lawson and told him l was ready to begin on the qualification report . I had written dozens of qualification reports , and I knew what a " good " one looked like . Resorting to the actual test data only on occasion , Lawson and I proceeded to prepare page after page of elaborate , detailed engineering curves , charts , and test logs , which purported to show what had happened during the formal qualification tests . Where temperatures were too high , we deliberately chopped them down a few hundred degrees , and where they were too low , we raised them to a value that would appear reasonable to the LTV and military engineers . Brake pressure , torque values , distances , times ? everything of consequence was tailored to fit . Occasionally , we would find that some test either had n't been performed at all or had been conducted improperly . On those occasions , we " conducted ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For nearly a month we worked on the graphic presentation that would be a part of the report . Meanwhile , the final qualification attempt had been completed , and the brake , not unexpectedly , had failed again . VV E FINISHED OI R WORK on the graphic portion of the report around the first of June . Altogether , we had prepared nearly two hundred pages of data , containing dozens of deliberate falsifications and misrepresentations . I delivered the data to Gretzinger , who said he had been instructed to deliver it personally to the chief engineer , Bud Sunderman , who in turn would assign someone in the engineering department tocomplete the written portion of the report . He gathered the bundle of data and left the office . Within minutes , he was hack with the data , his face white with anger . " That damned Sink 's beat me to it , " he said furiously . " He 's already talked to Bud about this . and now Sunderman says no one in the engineering department has time to write the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him we could n't . " The words had barely left his mouth when Russell Line burst in the door . " What the hell 's all the fuss about this damned report ? " he demanded Patiently , Gretzinger explained . " There 's nc fuss . Sunderman just told me that we 'd have to write the report down here , and I said wi could n't . Russ , " he went on , " I 've told you before that we were n't going to write the report . I math my position clear on that a long time ago . " Line shut him up with a wave of his hand and turning to me , bellowed , " I 'm getting sick am tired of hearing about this damned report . Nowt write the goddamn thing and shut up about it ! " He slammed out of the office . Gretzinger and I just sat for a few second looking at each other . Then he spoke . " Well , I guess he 's made it pretty clear , hasn he ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what we should have done was quit a ion time ago . Now , it 's too late . " Somehow , I was n't at all surprised at this tur of events , and it did n't really make that much di ference . As far as I was concerned , we were a up to our necks in the thing anyway , and writir the narrative portion of the report could n't mal me more guilty than I already felt myself to b Within two days , 1 had completed the narr tive , or written portion , of the report . As a fin sop to my own self-respect , in the conclusion the report I wrote . " The B. F. Goodrich P/ 2-1162-3 brake assembly does not meet the i tent or the requirements of the applicable speci cation documents and therefore is not qualified This was a meaningless gesture , since I km that this would certainly be changed when t report went through the final typing process . Su enough , when the report was published , the nef tive conclusion had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before publication . Qualification reports always hear the sigt ture of the person who has prepared them . I fused to sign the report , as did Lawson . Wart was later asked to sign the report .

" The engineering secretary who was delega. the responsibility of " dogging " the rep through publication told me later that after Lawson , and Warren had all refused to sign report , she had asked Sink if he would sign . replied , " On something of this nature , I ( lc think a signature is really needed .

Lawson and now openly hostile to Warren and Sink , d ourselves on one side of the conference hide Warren sat on the other side . Sink , chairing the meeting , paced slowly in front of a blackboard , puffing furiously on a pipe . The meeting was called , Sink began , " to see where we stand on the A7D . " What we were going to do , he said , was to " level " with LTV and tell them the " whole truth " about the A7D . " After all , " he said , " they 're in this thing with us , and they have the right to know how matters stand . " " In other words , " I asked , " we 're going to tell them the truth ? " " That 's right , " he replied . " We 're going to level with them and let them handle the ball from there . " " There 's one thing I do n't quite understand , " I interjected . " Is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that we 've lied ? " " Now , wait a minute , " he said angrily . " Let 's do n't go off half-cocked on this thing . It 's not a matter of lying . We 've just interpreted the information the way we felt it should be . " " I do n't know what you call it , " I replied , " but to me it 's lying , and it 's going to be damned hard to confess to them that we 've been lying all along . " He became very agitated at this and repeated , " We 're not lying , " adding , " I do n't like this sort of talk . " I dropped the matter at this point , and he began discussing the various discrepancies in the report . We broke for lunch , and afterward , I came back to the plant to find Sink sitting alone at his desk , waiting to resume the meeting . He called me over and said he wanted to apologize for his outburst that morning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he confessed , " and I think you 've got the wrong picture . I do n't think you really understand everything about this . " Perhaps so , I conceded , but it seemed to me that if we had already told LTV one thing and then had to tell them another , changing our story completely , we would have to admit we were lying . " No , " he explained patiently , " we 're not really lying . All we were doing was interpreting the figures the way we knew they should be . We were just exercising engineering license . " During the afternoon session , we marked some forty-three discrepant points in the report ; forty-three points that LTV would surely spot as occasions where we had exercised " engineering license . " After Sink listed those points on the blackboard , we discussed each one individually . As each point came up , Sink would explain that it was probably " too minor to bother about , " or that perhaps it " would n't be wise to open that can of worms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " LTV just would n't understand . " When the meeting was over , it had been decided that only three points were " worth mentioning . " Similar conferences were held during August and September , and the summer was punctuated with frequent treks between Dallas and Troy and demands by the Air Force to see the raw test data . Tempers were short , and matters seemed to grow worse . Finally , early in October 1968 , Lawson submitted his resignation , to take effect on October 25 . On October 18 , I submitted my own resignation , to take effect on November 1 . In my resignation , addressed to Russell Line , I cited the A7D report and stated : " As you are aware , this report contained numerous deliberate and willful misrepresentations which , according to legal counsel , constitute fraud and expose both myself and others to criminal charges of conspiracy to defraud ...

" I have your resignation here , " he snapped , " and I must say you have made some rather shocking , I might even say irresponsible , charges . This is very serious . " Before I could reply , he was demanding an explanation . " I want to know exactly what the fraud is in connection with the A7D and how you can dare accuse this company of such a thing ! " I started to tell some of the things that had happened during the testing , but he shut me off saying , " There 's nothing wrong with anything we 've done here . You are n't aware of all the things that have been going on behind the scenes . If you had known the true situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that in view of my apparent " disloyalty " he had decided to accept my resignation " right now , " and said it would be better for all concerned if I left the plant immediately . As I got up to leave he asked me if I intended to " carry this thing further , " I answered simply , " Yes , " to which he replied , " Suit yourself . " Within twenty minutes , I had cleaned out my desk and left . Forty-eight hours later , the B. F. Goodrich Company recalled the qualification report and the four-disk brake , announcing that it would replace the brake with a new , improved , five-disk brake at no cost to LTV . Ten months later , on August 13 , 1969 . I was the chief government witness at a bearing conducted before Senator William Proxmire 's Economy in Government Subcommittee . I related the A7D story to the committee , and my testimony was supported by Searle Lawson , who followed me to the witness stand . Air Force officers also testified , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had conducte an investigation of the A7D brake at the reque of Senator Proxmire , Both Air Force and GA ( investigators declared that the brake was dal gerous and had not been tested properly . Testifying for Goodrich was R. G. Jeter. viee president and general counsel of the compam from the Akron headquarters . Representing th Troy plant was Robert Sink . These two denie any wrongdoing on the part of the Goodric Company , despite expert testimony to the cm trary by Air Force and GAO officials . Sink wr quick to deny any connection with the writing the report or directing of any falsification claiming to have been on the West Coast at tltime . John Warren was the man who had supe wised its writing , said Sink . As for me , I was dismissed as a high-scho graduate with no technical training , while Sir testified that Lawson was a young , inexperience engineer . " We tried to give him guidance , " Sir testified , " but he preferred to have his own co victions . " About changing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When you take data fro several different sources , you have to rationali among those data what is the true story . This part of your engineering know-how . " He a milted that changes had been made in the dal " but only to make them more consistent with t overall picture of the data that is available . " Jeter pooh-poohed the suggestion that ar thing improper occurred , saying : " We ha thirty-odd engineers at this plant ... and I s to you that it is incredible that these men woe stand idly by and see reports changed or falsifii . I mean you just do not have to do that wo ing for anybody .. .. Just nobody does that . " The four-hour hearing adjourned with no r conclusion reached by the subcommittee . But i following day the Department of Defense ITIC sweeping changes in its inspection , testing , a reporting procedures . A spokesman for the D ( said the changes were a result of the Goodr episode . THE A7D IS NOW IN SERVICE , sporting a Go rich-made five-disk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm told . Business at the Goodr plant is good . Lawson is now an engineer LTV and has been assigned to the A7D prof. possibly explaining why the A7D 's new bra work so well . And I am now a newspa reporter . At this writing , those remaining at Good ? including Warren ? are still secure in the sz positions , all except Russell Line and Rol Sink . Line has been rewarded with a promos to production superintendent , a large step ward on the corporate ladder . As for Sink . moved up into Line 's old job .
