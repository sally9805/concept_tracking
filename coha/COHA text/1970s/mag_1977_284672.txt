The son of a dentist , he grew up hungering for more action and fame than his home town of Robinson , Ill. , could possibly offer . So right out of high school , in 1939 , a feisty welterweight by then , he signed up with the regular Army . As promised , adventure and travel were his - Honolulu , Schofield Barracks , amateur boxing , Pearl Harbor , Guadalcanal , Purple Heart , Bronze Star . But advancement seemed beyond James Jones - twice he made noncom and got busted back to private . After five boisterous years and a war , he returned to civilian life . But he packed the Army with him and marched its brawling , grumbling , whoring characters through his typewriter . The result was From Here to Eternity in 1951 . The novel was greeted with raves , big sales and a National Book Award . Critics invoked Crane , Hemingway and Wolfe when writing about the veteran 's furious , gritty depiction of the U.S. Army as it was just before World War II . Yet at Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart failure , it could be said that in writing , as in soldiering , advancement seemed somehow beyond him . <P> To Paris . As a young literary lion , Jones could not be expected to accept such a view . He proclaimed that his second novel , Some Came Running ( 1957 ) , was not only longer than War and Peace but better . In fact , he said , it was " the greatest novel we 've had in America . " The critics vehemently disagreed and Jones went off to live in Paris . He and his blonde wife Gloria ( once a stand-in for Marilyn Monroe ) were to spend 16 years abroad . Throughout , Jones kept doggedly writing , but never again did he achieve the acclaim of Eternity . <P> The Thin Red Line ( 1962 ) impressed some reviewers . Jones , like Dreiser , often infused his fiction with a force that transcended the clumsy writing . Before long , however , even his primitive power seemed to have fizzled away . Such novels as Go to the Widow-Maker ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) were not only badly written but also burdened by fatuous philosophizing . <P> Jones never seemed thrown or slowed down by the loss of critical approval . Indeed , he never indulged in the public pouts one expects of celebrated literary types . In Paris , apart from a couple of boorish flashes of temper , he lived an abundant life and made his strikingly craggy face familiar around the boulevards . He also continued to write and yearn for literary immortality . Even when he did gripe about reviewers , one could wonder whether he really cared what they were saying-or even quite understood . " They just said I was a bad writer , bad grammar , blah , blah , blah , " he told one interviewer . It was as if the fine points of writing did not matter that much to his work . And perhaps they did not , any more than the fine points of draftsmanship mattered to Grandma Moses when she sat at her pine table .                @ @ @ @ @
