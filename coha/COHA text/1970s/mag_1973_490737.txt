THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment DURING the war years , it often seemed that Americans on opposite sides of the war issue had developed greater bitterness toward each other than any American had developed toward the Vietnamese foe -- almost as though the war were not really the issue that was dividing us but only one irritant in a purely private quarrel among ourselves . And now that an American withdrawal from Vietnam appears to he finally almost completed , it has indeed turned out that our quarrels with " the enemy " have been easier-to resolve than our quarrels among ourselves . The peace has come , but we Americans remain embattled . To the North Vietnamese for we are promising gifts  --  as we should he doing . If the figures that are being bandied about on the amount of aid we are ready to hand over are correct  --  figures ranging from two and a half to four and a half billion dollars  --  we 'll have to send the B-52s back over Hanoi after all , this time to drop bales of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are promising punishment . While the Vietnamese who were shooting at our troops are cashing their United States checks in Hanoi as they prepare to get on with taking over the South , the American draft evaders and deserters , who opted out of the shooting , will remain in exile , for the President has said that they must pay a price , and the price is a " criminal penalty . " The American people have emerged from the war exhausted , but the American authorities have emerged from the war with a chip on their shoulders . They arc returning home from their inglorious foreign adventures with wounded pride , with little disposition to face the truth about it all , and with old scores to settle . It will be the job of the American people now to calm these edgy , defiant , war-trained leaders and gently but firmly draw them into peaceful ways . During the war , some radical groups had the slogan " Bring the war home . " And the war did come home . Now we have a peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &c.; THE Museum of American Folk Art , one of the little galleries on West Fifty-third Street that cluster around the skirts of the Museum of Modern Art , has put together a show called " Occult , " and we stopped by there the other afternoon for a look around . Most of the objects in the exhibit had been made for use in such arcane practices as sorcery , witchcraft , astrology , and phrenology , and most of them had the sturdy , simple , earthen look that is characteristic of folk art . Chronologically , they ranged from a hook of voodoo recipes lettered by hand in 1796 to the current price list of Madam Swift , of Gainesville , Florida , who advertises " Sassafras Root for bad blond , stomach trouble , gas , colic " and " Mandrake Root for lost courage , bowel trouble , and fever . " Philosophically , the show struck us as apt , since the position of folk art in the art world is something like that of the occult in the world of religion . Herbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , and he seemed proudest of a metal-and-wood voodoo statue of the Baron Samedi , Lord of the Cemetery . The statue , about seventy-five years old and part of Mr. Hemphill 's own extensive collection of folk art , is three feet tall , and its arms and legs are jointed . The Baron Samedi 's vertebrae arc painted on the front of his body , and his face is smooth and wears a small , knowing smile . " It was discovered in 1960 in the back of a black barbershop in the old quarter of New Orleans , " Mr. Hemphill said . " When it was found , it was still covered with blood and chicken feathers . " Mr. Hemphill showed us walking sticks from Appalachia carved in the shape of snakes , a Pennsylvania Dutch wizard 's chain that is said to constrict in the presence of evil , and a mechanical fortune-teller called the Zoltan Mystique Voice Horoscope . Behind the glass of the Zoltan Mystique Voice Horoscope was a seer wearing a turban and staring into an opaque crystal ball . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to our astrological sign , and picked up the little earphone . We heard scratchy orchestra music and then a voice with a bogus foreign accent . " This is the time to thoroughly investigate all angles before investing , " the voice said . " The numbers eight and nine arc favorable . " The wall next to the Zoltan Mystique Voice Horoscope was covered JP 11 1 i Tal 7 30 FEBRUARY 1 7 , 1 9 7 3 millionaire will . " Mr. Andrews told us our initials , which impressed us , and predicted that we would enjoy a financial windfall toward the end of the year , which pleased us . " Eight hourlong readings in a day is usually tops for me , " he said . " Sometimes the magic works and sometimes it does n't . " Fish Market FISH . Hundreds of red snappers , Carolina mullets , flounders , bluefish , striped bass , cod , king-fish , pompano , Palm Beach mackerels , and others , looking glum and smelling of the sea , lie in neat rows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes up most of the Ieft wall of the M. Citarella Fish Market , at Seventy-fifth Street and Broadway . Spotlights from the store 's lofty ceiling beam down on the slick , smooth fish , giving them an added surface shininess . A midsection of the counter is occupied by fillets  --  smoky bluefish fillets , snow-white sole fillets , silvery-white scrod fillets  --  all of them sprigged with parsley . One end of the counter is taken up by shrimp in various sizes and states  --  large and small raw-hi-the-shell shrimp , lg. &; sin . raw cleaned shrimp , Ig. &; sm. boiled-in-theshell shrimp , and lg. &; sm. boiled cleaned shrimp  --  which sell for between two-eighty and six-fifty a pound . Farther to the back of the store , still along the left wall , are a scale ; a work area , consisting of a butcher-block counter , a sink , and an electric scraper suspended from the ceiling ; and an ice machine that noisily produces two thousand pounds of ice per day . On the right side of the store , from front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of dozen lobsters move about languidly ; a freezer ; a cash register ; and a bare Formica counter . The store 's front window contains four octopuses , to which four fresh white carnations have been pinned ; a large sea bass and a large carp , their mouths held open by whole lemons ; a few live crabs ; and an elusive pet frog . Coolers situated in the back of the store hold more fish many more fish . People . Slightly over two hundred attractive young working women and housewives wearing fashionable platform shoes , flared slacks , and belted bright plaid coats ; middle-aged and older women in sensible shoes , kilt c-lengtli dresses , and fur-trimmed dark cloth coats ; and a fair number of men of all ages and sartorial rigs  --  a well-heeled , cosmopolitan Manhattan crowd  --  come into the M. Citarella Fish Market on a dusky winter Tuesday between 4:15 P.M. and 6:15 P.M. ( closing time . ) . One of the store 's two owners , Johnny Brignolo , and two employees wait on the customers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been pointed to on a piece of white paper , put it on the scale , and then take a few steps across the narrow store 's sawdust-sprinkled concrete floor and set the weighed , priced fish on the Formica counter near the cash register . Sometimes they offer guidance ( " For four big eaters , I 'd buy at least three pounds of whitefish if I were you " ) . Sometimes they prepare a fish to a customer 's specifications in the work area . They snip the fins and tail off a perch with a pair of scissors , pry open a dozen cherrystone dams , tap a large knife with a rubber-headed mallet to drive it through a carp , or remove the scales from a pike with the electric scraper , and only then slap the customer 's selection down on the counter near the cash register . Vincent McCaffery , the store 's other owner , presides at the cash register . THE NEW YORKER ( Mr. Brignolo and Mr. 1V1cCaffery were partners of Mike Citarella , who founded the market bearing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to 107th Street and Broadway in 1934 , and opened it at the present address in 1941 . When Mr. Citarella retired , ten years ago , his two partners continued the business . ) Mr. McCaffery , a tall , broad , forty-year-old Irishman with red wavy hair and the gift of gab , puts the fish in a couple of additional sheets of white waterproof vegetable-parchment paper and slides it into a brown paper bag . He also , more or less simultaneously , answers the phone and scribbles down orders , makes change , gives out recipes , and bestows shopping bags even upon those customers who buy only seventy-five cents ' worth of codfish , if they are carrying other packages . McCaffery sets a cheerful tone at the M. Citarella Fish Market , dispensing " Hi , hcautiful " s to the beautiful and not-so-beautiful alike as generously as lie dispenses shopping bags , and his customers look as if the act of buying fish were an enjoyable one . With over a hundred people per hour at the cash register on this Tuesday afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy to banter . This is what happens at the cash register between 5:15 P.M. and 5:24 P.M. : BOTTLE-BRUNETTE OF PERHAPS FIFTY : Vinnie , I 've got company for dinner . Tell me how to cook these six salmon steaks . MCCAFFERY : Have you ever tried boiling them ? First you boil your greens for ten minutes . Then drop the salmon steaks in When the water has come back to a boil , simmer the steaks for seven or eight minutes . Take them out and they 're all done . They 'll be tender and not oily . MCCAFFERY ( handing a pretty young thing a slip of paper ) : Here 's the name of the painter I told you about . He 's done some work on the store for me . He paints good , and he 's reasonable . MCCAFFERY ( to a handsome young Japanese couple who are purchasing a whole striped bass ) : You 're going to cat it raw for sashimi , right ? ( He continues without waiting for an answer . ) I 'm proud to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish is fresh . It 's easy to see how fresh this one is . Look at these nice red gills ! Look at these nice shiny eyes ! I bought this fish at the Fulton Fish Market at o'clock this morning . ( The Japanese smile tentative/3 and speak rapidly to each other in Japanese . One suspects that the only word of McCaffery 's they understood was " sashimi . " ) WOMAN WITH LILTIND JAMAICAN ACCENT : Would you kindly wrap mine in ice ? I 'm travelling far . MCCAFFERY : Ice with pleasure . PLUMP WOMAN ( handing McCaffery a dime ) : Vincent , these scallops were two-ninety . I gave you three dollars and you gave me twenty cents change . MCCAFFERY : You 're a good girl . PLUMP WOMAN : Sure I am . ANOTHER PLUMP WOMAN : Vinnie , do I do the striped-bass fillets on one side or both ? MCCAFFERY : One side , darling . WOMAN : That 's right . I used to do them on both sides and they got too dried out .

Her mother already taught her . ( The French girl blushes and smiles prettily . ) McCaffery wraps up a pound of fillet of sole ( the store 's hest-selling fish ) for an elderly man , rings up the sale , and gives him a dollar-sixty change from a five-dollar bill . The man pockets the money , slowly puts on his gloves , adjusts his scarf , buttons his overcoat , picks up the package , puts it back down on the counter , takes another five-dollar bill out of his pocket , and hands it to McCaffery . MCCAFFERY ( gently ) : You already paid mu . ELDERLY MAN : Oh , thank you . BOTTLE-BRUNETTE OF PERHAPS FIFTY ( this time out of breath and come back to buy one salmon steak ) ; Here T am again . My husband just phoned and said he 'd invited one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAN CARRYING ? N ATTACHE CASE ' NI ) A BOTTLE OF PounLie-Fuissi : Eighty - nine cents pound for whiting ! I remember the days I used to pal ' fifty cents here . MCCAFFERY : before my time , but I 'm only here eighteen years . MAN : Cut it out . MCCAFFERY : Sixty-nine cents I remember . That was eight or ten years ago . But compared to everything else the whiting have stayed pretty normal . Porgies used to he sixty-nine cents a pound , too , and now they 're a dollar-seventy-five . Whitings are one of the nicest eating fish you can get , and they 're still reasonable . These here were caught off Cape May . WOMAN WEARING MINK COAT AND WINTER-VACATION TAN : Th forty a pound for halibut  --  that 's absolutely criminal ! MCCAFFERY ( iLrapping her four ' rounds of halibut ) : Halibut are out of season . This is the first nice halibut I 've seen since I do n't know when . WOMAN : I 'm used to paying fancy prices at kosher butchers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NEXT CUSTOMER IN LINE : Why do n't you take the whiting instead ? Whitings are one of the nicest eating fish von can get , and they 're still reasonable . WOMAN : My husband likes the halibut . What can I do : Prices . " They are enormous , " Mr. McCafiery concedes at six-fifteen , after the last customer has left and his twelve-hour-long day is about to end , but lie has no trouble selling about two thousand pounds of fish a day , six days a week . The mercury scare did n't hurt his business ( " That 's a dead issue " ) , nor did the Catholic Church t " People do eat less fish on Friday than they did before , but the ) cat more fish on Tuesday or Thursday or Saturday instead . Now Saturday is just as big a day for us as Friday " ) . Concern over cholesterol has been good for business , and so has the Weight Watchers ' Diet ( " You can actually see those Weight Watchers losing weight " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of lakes are polluted , " Mr. McCaffery says . " Porgies and other saltwater fish are expensive because they 're so scarce . Our fishermen have to use half-inch nets that let the small fish through , but the Russian trawlers off our coasts , just outside the twelve-mile limit , have fine nets that pick up almost every thing that swims . A lot of fish are getting fished out . Whitings arc still plentiful , so they 're still relatively cheap . I do better on whitings than I do on some high-priced items , like lobster . I pay two-eighty per pound for a twenty-five-pound box of lobsters . On their way to New York from Boston or Maine , the lobsters shrink down to twenty-three and a half or twenty-four pounds , and a couple are dead on arrival , so the lobsters wind up costing- mu threefort ? a pound . I sell live lobsters for three-eighty a pound . To make a decent profit , I 'd have to charge five dollars a pound , but you can only charge so much or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents a pound for whitings and sell them at eighty-nine cents . I have to average- a fortyper-cent profit on fish to survive . My rent has practically doubled over the last three years . It was six hundred dollars a month in 1969 , it 's a thousand dollars a month now , and in a few weeks it goes up to twelve hundred . My paper hill is over three hundred dollars a week . Employees ' wages are up , and employees are almost impossible to find at any salary . 1 need more ice than my ice machine can produce , so I spend around a hundred and twenty dollars a week for more ice . It costs me ninety-six dollars a week just to get the garbage carried out of here . Prices were lower in the nineteen-sixties , and , believe me , my profits were higher . " What a Dump THE scene on West Forty-third Street in front of Town Hall last Sunday evening looked hike something from an old movie  --  the opening night , perhaps , of another Broadway triumph for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All About Eve . " Black limousines were jammed bumper to bumper along the curb , and honking yellow taxis discharged excited-looking passengers . On the sidewalk , a smoothly dressed crowd jostled its way toward the box office and entrances of the staid old theatre . Flashbulbs popped . Movie cameras cranked . In fact , the occasion was a Broadway triumph for Bette Davis , but this time she was playing herself . Inside , the crowd was in a happy mileal . The first half of die program consisted of ? xcerpts from Miss Davis 's films , and there were cheers when the first clip  --  font " All About Eve " ? appeared on the screen . There were more cheers when she delivered her first line on the screen ? " Peace and quiet is for libraries . " And when she said , " For a woman , in the last analysis , nothing 's any good unless you can look up at dinner or across in bed , and there he is , " and added , with the trace of a sneer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more cheers still . The film clips showed Miss Davis in an immense variety of roles  --  from the sweet blind girl of " Dark Victory " to the disintegrating hag of " What Ever Happened to Baby Jane from the fiery simtherner of " jezebel " to the Bronx mania of " The Catered Affair . " clip from Edward Alhee 's " Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? , " in which Lli/abeth Taylor badgers Richard Burton to remember what movie Bette Davis says " What a dump ! " in , was followed by the scene in question ( from " Beyond the Forest " ) . In even excerpt , Miss Davis 's nervous intensity dominated the screen . The clips showed the . qualities that made her a kind of pre-women's-liberation feminist heroine. : pride , wit , intelligence , defiance , angel , worldliness , and a ' NILS - erful will . he last clip , like the first , was from " All About Eve . " Margo Charming drains her drink , climbs halfway up the stairs , turns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belts . It 's going to be a bumpy night . " The screen went dark , the lights went on , and Miss Davis walked from the Wings nut to the center of the Town Hall stage . Thu audience stood and applauded , There were shouts of " B rave l " Miss Davis wore a gown of black velvet and white satin , Her hair was blond bobbed in pageboy style , and her month was bright red . She held out her arms to accept the cheers , and IA hen at last the crowd quieted she said , " What can I say ? You have had a long session with me . Some of them were bad 3ears and some were glorious years , hut , oh , I would go through all the had times again for what you just did for me . " A couple of chairs and a table had been set up on the stage , and Miss Davis sat down and began to talk with John Springer . Mr. Springer is a veteran Broadway press agent , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with " Legendary Ladies of the Movies , " was his idea . He has wispy white hair and glasses , and he asked Miss Davis questions in a hesitant , respectful tone . " It 's really as if it were another person , at this age , " Miss Davis said . " It 's hard to believe I did all that , and it 's hard to believe I 'm still alive . " Miss Davis thanked George Arliss for giving her a start at Warner Brothers , and William ? Vyler for directing her in " Jezebel , " and Joseph Mankiewicz for writing " All About Eve . " " That was a script I thank God for , " she said . " Every line was so damned good . Miss Colbert was going to play it , but she hurt her hack and had to pull out , and I 'll always be grateful to her for that . When we were discussing the part of Margo Charming , Mr. Mankiewicz said , ' I 'll tell you what Margo is like . Margo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poncho . ' " Mr. Springer mentioned the tole of Scarlett O'Hara in " Gone wit h the Wind , " and said , " Many p , ople thought you should have played that part . " " I could have killed her ! " Miss Davis interrupted , referring , presumably , to Vivien Leigh . " There was a deal for Errol and me to play it . Mr. Flynn was beautiful and charming , but , beautiful and charming as he was , he would have been the worst Rhea Butler imaginable . " Miss Davis snapped open a gold cigarette case , lit a cigarette , and blew a cloud of smoke toward the balcony . The audience cheered . Miss Davis looked surprised , but after a moment she seemed to realize why they were cheering : Along with Bogart and Jean-Paul l3clmondo , she was always one of the screen 's most stylish smokers . Mr. Springer asked about leading men , and Miss Davis ticked off a few . " Henry Fonda - -I fell madly in love with him , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Boyer was a thrilling man to work with , and Leslie Howard . And Claude Rains  --  he had very good taste . I 'm very sad that jimmy Cagney and I never made a real film together , and that I never made a real co-starring thing with Bogie . In that day , hard as it is to believe , one person could carry a film . So they hardly ever wasted us together . " Mr. Springer threw open the proceedings to questions from the floor . ' Fite first two or three people contented themselves with delivering tributes . " Where did you get that walk ? " someone then asked . " It was never conscious  --  those things never are , " Miss Davis said . " Of course , after I saw a few films I gathered I walked that way . Let 's say it reflected my zest for life . " Someone asked Miss Davis if she had any plans to return to the stags , and she said she had n't . " The last time I came back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was offered no employment in California . I honestly wish I liked the theatre more , because it would really be the thing for me to do today . " There were more questions and more tributes . Finally , an earnest young woman asked , " Miss Davis , how do y ou go about constmeting a role ? " " I do n't , " Miss Davis said . " It 's a sort of feeling . I 'll quote Mr. Rains : I learn the lines and pray to God . ' " Slow curtain . The End .
