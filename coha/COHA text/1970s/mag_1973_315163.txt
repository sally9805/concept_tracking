As Christmas approaches and the most hectic and trying year in his memory draws to a close , President Nixon will face a particularly severe test . Congress will recess late this week , sending members home for a month of fence mending and careful probing of sentiment about the President among those whom Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott calls " the people in the drugstores . " What the legislators hear may well determine Nixon 's future , for most would agree with Republican National Chairman George Bush that " the momentum for resignation or impeachment will have to come from the people . " Adds Scott : " Every member of Congress is a walking Gallup poll , and a better one because he has more at stake . " <P> Popularity Gain . Largely because two nationwide polls showed the biggest rise in Nixon 's popularity since the Viet Nam peace agreement was signed last January , the President and his aides seemed ebullient last week . The latest Harris poll was taken in mid-November , before the public learned of the mysterious 18-minute gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that 37% of Americans rated Nixon 's performance as " good " or " excellent " - up five points since October . The Gallup poll was conducted between Nov. 30 and Dec. 3 , after the tape gap became known ; it showed a four-point rise - to 31%-in public approval of Nixon since the alltime low in October and early November . <P> According to Gallup , most of Nixon 's gain in popularity has been in the <P> South . As one indication of his support there , some 1,200 delegates at a meeting of Southern Republicans in Atlanta cheered every mention of Nixon 's name . Nothing drew more howls of derision than mention of the news media , especially the TV networks and the Washington Post . But the delegates still laughed when Tennessee Congressman LaMar Baker joked : " What we 've got to do is get crime out of the White House and back into the streets . " <P> The upswing in the polls convinced many aides that Nixon 's Operation Candor was partly succeeding in explaining away his Watergate woes . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge as President . He met with his new energy team , headed by William E. Simon , then briefed 18 Governors on the crisis . He talked to Caspar Weinberger , Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , about his own ideas for a health insurance plan that would cover all Americans , but gave no details about timing or financing . He was moved by Columnist Mike Royko 's report that a clerk in the Veterans Administration had decided not to pay for plastic surgery for Leroy Bailey , 31 , of La Grange , Ill. , whose face was shattered by a rocket in South Viet Nam in 1968 . Nixon ordered that the VA reverse the decision .
