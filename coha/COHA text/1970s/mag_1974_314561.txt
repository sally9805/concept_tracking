Twelfth Night and <P> Romeo and Juliet <P> by William Shakespear <P> There is no law that requires the American Shakespeare Theater at Stratford , Conn , to vary its productions between the barely adequate and the eminently atrocious . It is just the sloppy custom of the place . The sad truth is that a merely average revival of a classic , whether by Shakespeare or some other great playwright , leaves only the forlorn impression of a weighted balloon . It takes superior acting , direction and a current of passion and imagination to raise it gloriously aloft . Stratford opened its 20th season with two grounded balloons , Twelfth Night and Romeo and Juliet . <P> Twelfth Night fluttered the less feebly of the two . It is a real plotboiler . There are identical twins , separated by shipwreck and tossed on an alien shore . There are assumed disguises , confusions of love and mistaken identities . <P> British Director David William emphasizes the languorous melancholy beneath the romantic comedy , the narcissistic infatuation with the image of oneself being in love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the play . However , too many of the pregnant pauses give birth to nothing . <P> Too often the paradisiacal glamour of Illyria , the lovely songs , the immortal lines , the great bard himself , dissolve and leave but the plot behind . Now girl-in-boy's-clothing palls , now which-twin-is-which proves yawningly wearisome . Many of the jokes are far past saving and a good bit of the chop logic word play is tedious word work . In Director William 's conception of the comedy , the prankishness and the poetry are divorced instead of being mated . <P> Romeo and Juliet seem to have their signals rather than their stars crossed . When they meet , it seems to be for a quick date rather than to share a common fate . They seem to be unlucky , not doomed . <P> Director Michael Kahn must bear some sizable responsibility for this . He has elected to fight Shakespeare rather than join him . He has set the play in 1866 , though what affinity the drama has with either the risorgimento or the 19th century is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time change always has the same effect : it up dates the costumes and jarringly displaces the Elizabethan line . Kahn claims to have based his 1866 version on Luigi Visconti 's film , The Leopard . But it lacks any trace of the rich textures of the Visconti settings . No one could look at this tacky Verona for a moment and call it " fair . " <P> Puppets might supply more emotion than these actors do . There is only one stridently monotonous note in Roberta Maxwell 's voice box . Her Juliet is a fishwife haggling unsuccessfully over a flounder rather than a young girl losing the world and her dear life for love . David Birney 's Romeo is so limp and bland that it comes as a wondrous surprise that he has either the will or strength to climb to Juliet 's balcony . Mercutio , that man from whom words flow like liquid light , emerges in David Rounds ' rendering as little more than a stand-up nightclub comic . <P> Tampering with Shakespeare , trampling on Shakespeare can scarcely harm adult playgoers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students who are bused to Stratford each season ?
