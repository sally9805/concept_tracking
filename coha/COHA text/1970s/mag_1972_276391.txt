" Bye-bye , I 'm free , free as a bird . I 'm going to have a ball in New York , " said Martha Mitchell to Washington Post Columnist Maxine Cheshire as she packed up to leave the capital for good . After several months of unaccustomed silence , the chatty wife of the former Attorney General wanted to clear up some unfinished business . For one thing , " I want to be sure my side is revealed in that people know I 'm not sitting here a mental case or an alcoholic , " she told another reporter . Martha also wanted to identify the brute who had ripped the phone from the wall of her California hotel room last June just as she started to answer a question about the Watergate bugging . He was Steve King , her bodyguard , she said . Since then King has been promoted to security director of the Committee for the Re-Election of the President . All this was so fascinating that Cheshire went back to the Mitchells ' apartment for a second interview the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who told her , " You ca n't talk to anybody . " Seeing Martha on the stairs , Maxine asked : " Why wo n't you talk to me ? " Looking harassed , Martha replied , " I ca n't , honey . I just ca n't . " <P> ? <P> " I always wanted a real training camp in the mountains , " said Muhammad Ali . " Real logs , hard beds , coal stoves . " Ali already has two log cabins and a gym at Deer Lake , Pa. ; he plans enough additional cabins and mobile homes to sleep 20 people , including his wife , one son and three daughters . Ali figures such sylvan simplicity is worth the $150,000 it will eventually cost . So far , the 30-year-old ex-heavyweight champion can afford it-this week 's Madison Square Garden bout with Floyd Patterson guarantees him $250,000-but after that , Ali plans to go easy on the spending . " I 'm going to make my wife make her own clothes . Man , if I do n't watch it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids to end up being waitresses . " <P> ? <P> There happens to be a pool table in the White House , but Julie Nixon Eisenhower has never used it . Still , Julie did n't hesitate when , visiting a home for senior citizens in a Cleveland suburb , she saw a pool table . She chalked up , promptly missed two shots in a row . Later , at a speech to a Kiwanis women 's meeting in Columbus , Julie offered to put her life on the line for Dad and country . Asked if she would be " willing to die for the Thieu regime " in South Viet Nam , Julie answered , " Yes , I would , " and went on to defend the President 's policy of gradual withdrawal . <P> ?
