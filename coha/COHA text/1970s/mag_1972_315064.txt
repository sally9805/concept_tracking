RARELY has there been such a bizarrely precise intersection of fantasy and brutal reality . In half a dozen Manhattan theaters one morning last week , projectors were unreeling the mustily violent world of The Godfather , the Mafia wars of 1945-55 . While Paramount 's actors did their impersonations of caporegimes and button men in supposedly archaic rites of murder , the bright black Cadillacs were nosing up to the curb outside Guide 's funeral home in Brooklyn . <P> The scene there had an authenticity that was almost theatrical . From the brownstones along Clinton Avenue , old women stared in black shawls . Men in working clothes muttered to one another in Old World accents . Inside , under a lithograph of Christ , rested a $5,000 burnished bronze casket festooned with flowers and surrounded by heavy , silently angry men and weeping women . Within it lay Joey Gallo , assassinated three days before as he celebrated his 43rd birthday in a Lower East Side clam house called Umbertos ( TIME , April 17 ) . His mother keened : " My Joey ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not strictly a Mob funeral in the old style-nothing to compare with the opulent rites for , say , New Jersey Racketeer Willie Moretti after he was executed in 1951 . No ambassadors came from the other New York Mafia families , but they had their reasons for staying away-too many police and reporters , and war in the air . The cortege , led part of the way by a police car with a flashing dome light , slowly toured Gallo 's old President Street neighborhood , then drove to Brooklyn 's Greenwood Cemetery . Police and federal agents were among the spectators . An unusually large number of gravediggers and an out-of-place olive-drab telephone van were on hand . The mourners filed by , dropping single roses onto the casket and crying : " Take him , Big Boy ! You 've got him now , Big Boy ! " Big Boy meant God . <P> In its baroque atmospherics , the Gallo assassination was more than merely an episode of gangster nostalgia . As Gallo lay in his open casket , his face a mask of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets are going to run red with blood , Joey . " Within the space of six days , a total of five other bodies turned up , and the word was around that three more executions had been approved by the family of New York Mafia Overlord Carlo Gambino . <P> Blood Feud . More ominously , the Gallo and Colombo gangs last week officially declared war . The two clans " went to the mattresses " - the Mob 's term for consolidating forces in fortified hideouts , hauling in mattresses for a long siege and sleeping on them for the duration . It was the most bitter gang conflict in a decade , and could become the bloodiest campaign since the savage Castellammarese war in 1930-31 , when scores of Mafiosi killed off one another in the streets across the country .
