txt Letters to the Editor pg . 37 Letters to the Editor The Enemy Within the Gates ' To the Editor : Mr. Ford 's address at West Point amounted to little more than an unabashed admission that guns were far . more desirable to him at this stage than butter . It was almost exactly the kind of speech Mr. Nixon might have made , except where he might have placed the main emphasis on " Number One , " Mr. Ford opted for " Second to None , " which is hardly new either . What is new , however , and not a little dangerous in the bargain , is the impending , passage of a peacetime military budget far in excess of any we have ever known in time of war . A precedent is being set before our very eyes , one almost certain to get a stamp of approval from Congress . This military budget , as . far as true national defense is concerned , is for the birds . It is based on a false premise  --  the assumption that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seas , professing a political and economic philosophy so much at variance with our own that we must of necessity be saturated with the means of overkill if we are to survive . We need not look abroad for our main enemy . All we need do is look in the mirror . Our main enemy is ourselves , within the gates , so to speak . Even while Mr. Ford and his Secretary of State were in such romantic cities as Madrid and Rome , all in the interest of national defense , of course , some forty-odd fires were started by the enemy within in the South Bronx area alone , all in the course of a single evening . It was a pyrotechnic display exceeding by far any ever set off by the moujiks of old Malpractice Litigation : The Arbitration Path To the Editor : With so much talk in the papers about arbitration as an alternative to court litigation in resolving medical malpractive claims , there is need for a clear understanding of the distinction between compulsory and voluntary arbitration . With few exceptions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides have chosen this method to settle their disputes voluntarily . The only exceptions are disputes between unions of fire or police officers and municipal governments where specific laws have been enacted submitting such disputes to compulsory arbitration under our auspices . There are several ' existing medical malpractice arbitration plans administered by the A.A.A. All of these are voluntary . There are also a number of plans under consideration both in Congress and in a number of state legislatures around the country . Some of these would require a provider of medical care ( hospital or physician ) to offer arbitration as an alternative , but with the patient having the option of either choosing arbitration or going to court . The entangled issues of medical malpractice are complicated enough without spreading confusion over the differences between voluntary and corn- , pulsory arbitration . It is simply not Russia prior to the revolution . Only their fires were set on the landed estates , whereas ours were set in a . heavily populated urban ' area . But the parallel is striking enough to suggest that political purification might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we persist in denying a fairly large segment of our people the privileges that go with first-class citizenship we automatically , relegate them to a state closely bordering on savagery . Joblessness , hunger , everrising rentals and utility costs promote hopelessness and eventually angry despair . All these factors go into the make-up of the enemy within the gates , a far more formidable foe than the one for whom the budget was intended . What constitutes real national defense ? Is it not time that those who profess to be authorities be challenged ? Have we learned nothing from the " disasters of the war " ? Are not both of our topmost political leaders today casualties , credulity-wise , of that misbegotten war ? Of what avail will be a nearly $100-billion defense budget be if the enemy within spreads like a malignant cancer throughout urban America ? HERBERT WILKE New York , June 5 , 1975 true , as has been implied recently in ' the press , that arbitration of medical malpractice claims raises constitutional issues of the denial of due process and equal protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury trial . On the contrary , all proposed arbitration plans offer the citizen an alternative to litigation which he can either choose or turn down . DONALD B. STRAUS President , Research Institute American Arbitration Association New York , June 6 , 1975 ? The Park 's Befoulers To the Editor : Once again I read that animals are . being taken to task by the local citizenry . This time it concerns Central . Park and defecating dogs ( letter May 21 ) .. Dogs are not to blame for ruining the paths , grass and air of the park . Blame the people who go to the Sheep Meadow for their pot parties and rock concerts ; the drunks and derelicts benched both inside and on the perimeter of the park and , finally , the graffiti-prone , barefooted , half-dressed youths frequenting that area . They are befouling Central Park , not the canine population . As for the dog feces mentioned , that should not pose any problem . It washes off with soap ' and water . CHARLES ZAUG Jackson Heights , N. Y. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor : I note with deep concern a press report that the House of Representatives voted 303 to 96 on May 20 to open " the three military academies to women . " There can be , I think , but one outcome to such- a course , if carried through into law , namely debilitation of that reservoir of highly competent male leadership for our Armed Forces , the tone for which is set in our officer corps by the graduates of our service academies . To rest this action on women 's rights and the fact that a very small minority of the graduates of the service academies never serve in combat is to place it on a false basis . If it should be approved by the Senate and , signed by the President , it will , I am convinced , prove to be an ill-considered action inimical to the best interests of the nation . It will play into the hands of our avowed enemies , striking at the traditions which for nearly two centuries have sustained the officer corps in our Army , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will weaken our defenses . This nation which we love , this land which we stand ready to defend with our lives is today facing its most perilous threat to its continued existence since civil war all but tore it apart . In the tragic event that that threat should be translated into reality , then , in the final analysis , our military establishment will stand between us and disastrous defeat . Whatever weakens that bulwark becomes a clear and present danger to the nation . I served ten years at West Point ? four in the Corps of Cadets and six as an instructor  --  and 38 years in our Army . I know both organizations , their ideals , their codes , their patriotism , their loyalty , their attachment to tradition , their strengths and their weaknesses . It is my earnest hope that the United States Senate will reject this proposed legislation but that if it approves it , the President will ' see fit to veto it . M. B. RIDGWAY General , U.S. Army ( Ret . ) Pittsburgh , June 4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor : . Rightly or wrongly . in the eyes of many non-Americans the City of New York is the very epitome of the American way of life . How tragic that this great city should now be in such a desperate financial position . Are we to believe d nation that could squander such vast sums of money on the futile Apollo moon rockets and dealing out death and destruction in Vietnam is unable to find the comparatively small amount needed for the far more worthy cause of rescuing one of its leading cities from bankruptcy ? Perhaps the American armament manufacturers will show compassion and bail the city out with their Vietnam war profits . R. E. BYE Cardiff , Wales , June 1 , 1975 ? To the Editor : I have a good way for New York to solve its cash-flow problems : Stop building and rebuilding Bruckner Boulevard . WYLIE F. L. TUTTLE New York , May 29 , 1975 Armament Development C To the Editor : Considerable attention has been devoted to the creation of an Armament Development Center ( A.D.C. ) . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aberdeen , Md. , and the elimination of Picatinny Arsenal , Dover , N. J. , resulting in the loss of thousands of jobs and a $100-million payroll . The location for the A.D.C. at Picatinny Arsenal Involves the least expenditure of Federal funds and the quickest payback of the invested money from resultant savings . Picatinny Arsenal employs the largest scientific and engineering pool of talent in the Army . An Army study estimates that 50 per cent of this talent will be lost if the arsenal closes . The technical support for the production of 90 per cent of the munitions in this country is provided by Picatinny personnel . Of all of the tems of supply employed in the Southeast Asia war , those with the ' east unit-cost growth were the muni:ions items . The spectrum of technical expertise It Picatinny Arsenal covers 178 techiological functional capabilities as applied to 21 commodity groups . Ty ) ical of these technological functions ire formulation of reactive materials , gnition and combustion , explosive rains and kinetic-energy penetrators. typical of the commodity areas are . aclear and non-nuclear tube-fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tank-cannon ammunition , mines and mine systems . There are 25 situations where a capability at Picatinny Arsenal is unique and over 700 cases where the capability is unique as applied at the arsenal . The number of scientists and engineers who represent this expertise in Individual cases can be counted in one digit . If Picatinny is closed , capabilities vital to the national security would be stripped bare of any essentially unique talent . The investment cost and economic return on investment is demonstrably superior in the choice of Picatinny Arsenal as the Armament Development Center location . The risk factors to national security are great should the technical expertise of the people at Picatinny Arsenal be lost . It would seem that any prudent man would have to choose Picatinny Arsenal as the location for the Armament Development Center when weighing all factors bearing on the situation .

Lisbon : The Intervener To the Editor : In their June 1 letter Michael Harrington and Irving Howe declare their " solidarity " with the Portuguese Socialists , but the main body of their letter is devoted to an attack on the United States for allegedly contemplating intervention in Portugal . We are not aware of any such American plan . But we are painfully aware that the Soviet Union has already intervened massively in Portugal . There are reliable estimates that the Soviet Union is supplying the Portuguese Communists with at least $10 million a month , an astronomic amount for a country the size of Portugal . ( The equivalent figure for America , ? with a population more than twenty times that of Portugal , would be about $215-million a month , more than four times the total Nixon campaign budget for 1972 . ) Beyond this , the Soviet Union maintains an 80-person embassy in Lisbon and has at least six known K.G.B . agents operating in the country . Certainly American Socialists concerned about the survival of a democratic Portugal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they should advocate an American policy of aiding the Portuguese democratic forces . This is exactly what the Portuguese Socialist leader Mario . Soares urged in an interview with Time Magazine ( May 5 ) . While cautioning against a " get tough " policy , he noted that " It is necessary for the ** help the democratic forces maintain a position of balance and openness . The contrary position will lead , in the short run , toward a victory for the Communists . " One form of restrained yet potentially effective American intervention would be te let the Russians know that they will not have their cherished European security conference if the Communists subvert democracy in Portugal . This is the kind of action the Portuguese Socialists want America to take , and it is the responsibility of American Socialists ? indeed of all Americans concerned with human rights and peace ? to demand it .
