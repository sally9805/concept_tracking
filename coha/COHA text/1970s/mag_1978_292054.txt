How many potholes are there ? <P> <P> Driving to work one wintry day , Richard Gaskill of Glenview , Ill. , suddenly felt a sinking sensation . Result : two blown tires , two bent wheel rims , a lost hubcap and a bill for $191.14 . In Boston last week , it took 20 men to extricate Patrolman William Mahoney and his 1,000-lb. horse from a 3 ft. - by- 3 ft. crevasse on a pathway in the city 's Public Garden . In Manhattan , officials are watching claims briskly mount against the city as a result of damaged roadways . <P> It is pothole time again , and after a frigid season of record snows , the nation 's potholes appear to be of record size and quantity . The House has already voted to spend $250 million to fill them , and Joseph Ewing , research director of the Transportation Road Information Program in Washington , estimates the grand total of potholes to be filled at 116.4 million . <P> Where on earth does Ewing get such a number ? Well , he adds up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the country : 6.4 million . Then he divides by the amount of fill required for the average pothole : 110 lbs . The resulting figure , of course , is no more than an elaborate guess . By similar magic , Ewing has figured out the cost of extra gas U.S. drivers will consume in swerving around the potholes : $626 million . <P> Ewing should meet Jack Tessman , a physics professor at Massachusetts ' Tufts University . To win a local television contest , the latter calculated the number of snowflakes that fell on Boston during February 's monster storm . He multiplied the average snowfall depth ( 27 in. ) by the area of Boston ( 43 sq . mi. ) , then divided the result by the volume of the average snowflake ( 1/10,000 cu . in . ) . Answer : 50 quadrillion ( 5 X 10 16 ) snowflakes . His prize : a Tessman family portrait-in snow .
