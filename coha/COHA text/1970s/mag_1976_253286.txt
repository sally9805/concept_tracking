BOY MEETS GIRL by BELLA and SAM SPEWACK <P> P.T. Barnum never died ; he went to Hollywood . That was Broadway 's view around 1935 when Boy Meets Girl was first presented in New York . Almost annually in those years , Shubert Alley applied a farcical hotfoot to the inane denizens of Celluloid City . <P> The show is still furiously funny , not because the setting is Hollywood but be cause the subjects are avarice , folly and desire , three aspects of human nature that make the whole world kin . The two protagonists , Robert Law ( Lenny Baker ) and J. Carlyle Benson ( Charles Kimbrough ) , are nuthouse intellectuals-that is to say , screenwriters . Playwrights Bella and Sam Spewack modeled them on the famed ' 20s collaborators Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur . Their problem is to put together a film vehicle for a narcissistic cowboy star whose IQ is perceptibly lower than that of his horse . <P> A commissary waitress , Susie ( Mary beth Hurt ) , who has granted her favors to some married bounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit pregnant , " provides the writing duo with an inspiration . They will pair her soon-to-be-born child with the roughrider of the purple sage and tug at the nation 's heartstrings . <P> They do , but there are rib-splitting complications involving studio moguls , frenetic decomposers of music and lyrics , and the amorous son of a British lord . <P> The cast 's spirited foolery inoculates the evening with laughter , and John Lithgow 's pell-mell direction would probably secure a friendly salute from the dean of comic mayhem , George Abbott , now 88 , who directed Boy Meets Girl the first time , 41 years ago .
