Winding up his visit to Russia , Astronaut Neil Armstrong delighted Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin with gifts from America-a small Russian flag that was carried on Apollo 11 and some chips of moon rock mounted in Lucite . Later , touring the Kremlin Armory museum with Cosmonaut Georgy Beregovoy , he joked that there had been no fair exchange . Beregovoy indicated the museum 's display of czarist crown jewels . " Pick one , " he said . Armstrong pointed . " Fine , " said the Russian . " That will cost you $300 million . " Replied Armstrong : " I think I 'll wait until they sell it at half price . " <P> " It 's embarrassing , " admits Yippie Abbie Hoffman . " You try to overthrow the Government and end up on the bestseller list . " Helped by the substantial sum of $75,000 that his Revolution for the Hell of It and Woodstock Nation have netted him in royalties and film rights , Hoffman has been able to overcome his embarrassment enough to start two more books . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet his son , Editor Christopher Cerf , he sauntered unannounced into Christopher 's office to find Hoffman slouched shirtless at the desk , scribbling away .

Secretly , she is a German spy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer tights and ruffles , a rose between her teeth , gaiety masking her embittered spirit . The role seems precisely tailored for Dietrich . Instead it will be played by Mary Poppins . Julie Andrews has in fact gone the English dance-hall route before-and flopped miserably-in one of Hollywood 's most expensive bombs . a multimillion-dollar loser called Star . On looks , anyway , Darling Lili figures to do better . <P> Governor Nelson Rockefeller would n't think of accepting-not in such company-but he could n't help laughing when he heard the proposition . His political rival , New York City Mayor John Lindsay , broke up a Manhattan luncheon for the Apollo 13 astronauts by suggesting that he and Rocky fly to the moon together .

" I mean , if I 'm carrying my guitar and my baby , and my husband 's in jail , I 'm not going to yell at some guy who holds the door open for me. "
