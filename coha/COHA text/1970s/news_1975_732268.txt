He demanded a separate seat , apart from the community , at next month 's conference of in*trial and developing nations and his demand threatened to force a delay of the conference . , But Mr. Wilson eased his stand this afternoon under intense pressure from his partners who insisted that the community must speak with one vice at the upcoming parley .
