A close encounter with Richard Dreyfuss <P> If you are ever playing trivia and someone asks for the corniest lines you 've ever heard , try the following : Girl ( approaching an actor she has seen only on the screen ) : I love you . Actor : Give me two minutes and I 'll love you right back . <P> That exchange says three things about the actor , hereafter identified as Richard Dreyfuss , the star of Jaws and two of this year 's best films , Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Goodbye Girl : 1 ) he is brash , 2 ) he is never at a loss for words and 3 ) he knows what he likes when he sees it-he and the girl , Lucinda Valles , 23 , have been together , off and on , ever since they met in a Manhattan restaurant three years ago . <P> Add to the first three a No. 4 : sometimes he does n't know when to shut up . Faster than you could say William Shakespeare , Dreyfuss was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cups : " Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediment ... " <P> The list could go on , but one word sums it up : energy . In person and onscreen , Dreyfuss , short , gat-toothed and , until recently , distinctly chubby , generates enough electricity to light up a small town-Cleveland or Chicago , say . " He has an energy that just flies off the screen , " says Neil Simon , who wrote The Goodbye Girl . " He does n't fall into any of the usual acting categories . He 's not a handsome-man type like Redford or a dramatic-actor type like Pacino or De Niro . Rick can do anything-and he is funnier than any of them . " Not a victim of false modesty , Dreyfuss agrees . How does he think he is in Goodbye Girl ? Just ask him : " I think I 'm wonderful . " <P> He is right , of course . He is good as the star-struck hero in Close Encounters , but he is nothing short of wonderful as Elliott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , the character is so like the real-life Dreyfuss that Simon would have saved everyone some trouble by just calling him Rick in the first place . The part was so natural , admits Rick himself , that " I could have done it as a 9-to-5 job for the rest of my life . Imagine ! Sixty years old and still shooting The Goodbye Girl ! " <P> Only halfway to 60 now , Dreyfuss has already had at least 60 years of acting experience . He can hardly remember a moment when he was not acting-if only for himself . He was born in New York City and spent his early childhood in Bayside , a pinkish nook of Queens . His grandmother had been private secretary to Socialist Leader Eugene Debs . His father was a passionate Zionist , and his mother was always peddling leftist petitions . " When you were poor and Jewish in New York , " says Dreyfuss , " you were either a left-winger or you were dead . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
