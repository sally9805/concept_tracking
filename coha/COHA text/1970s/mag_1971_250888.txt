Japanese Lanterns <P> Sir : Re your cover story on Hirohito Oct. 4 : for generations Japan has made it inferior and sold it cheaper than any country in the world . To make merchandise 10% poorer would mean the shirt would n't stand one washing , the appliance would n't last a week , and the radio would n't even bring in a local station . <P> It will be healthy for us if they are forced to revert to Japanese lanterns . Then , when the garden party is rained out , we can expect to throw the lanterns away , and the American manufacturer can return to the building of quality products . <P> SHELDON WALKER Pharr , Texas <P> Sir : Through the generosity ( or naivete ) of the U.S. , which supplied capital , raw material , modern equipment , technical assistance and even wide-open markets to the poor defeated Japanese during the past quarter-century , this little island country with no energy resources of any kind was able to reach the enviable position of world 's No. 3 industrial power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What other country in the world will help Japan carry through to the 21st century with the same rate of growth ? <P> EDWARD K. NIEH New York City <P> Sir : Again we are blaming the Japanese for our economic problems . Your article is something else people can grasp as a reason for hate . It comes at a time when there is a tendency to blame Japan for a trade imbalance created by allowing our workers to become fat and lazy . The simple fact is that the United States has been priced out of the world market . In most industries our workers are not so productive as the Japanese , and our technology is not superior . <P> RODNEY L. WALLACE Brookfield , Ill . <P> Sir : If it is true , as David Bergamini alleges , that the Emperor of Japan steered his nation into World War II , lost the war and then emerged smelling like a rose to become chief of state of the world 's third superpower , perhaps he really is a god , after all . <P> R.L. WINTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Emperor Hirohito that included some unusual instructions for respectful treatment of the magazine bearing his likeness . As background for understanding the position of the Emperor , would you reprint those instructions ? <P> ROBERT S. BROYLES Los Angeles <P> &gt; The position of Emperor Hirohito has changed somewhat , but here is the footnote from the issue of June 6 , 1932 : " Japanese who hope and trust that TIME readers will show every respect to His Majesty have made the following request : let copies of the present issue lie face upward on all tables ; let no object be placed upon the likeness of the Emperor , shown in his sacred enthronement regalia . " <P> Whipping Boy <P> Sir : Representative Richard Poff ( R. , Va. ) would have been a great Supreme Court Justice and a valuable asset to the survival of our country . <P> The liberal press expresses pious concern about divisiveness in the U.S. whenever conservatives fight for what they feel is right . Never a word is said about divisiveness when a few power-hungry " liberals " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Poff in order to enhance their political aims . <P> The South is a popular whipping boy for ruthless politicians looking for black votes , big-city votes and labor-union votes . <P> ORION A.
