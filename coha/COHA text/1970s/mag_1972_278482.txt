TO most Americans , the difficulty of selling oranges , tobacco or computers abroad might not seem to rank among the foremost concerns of foreign policy . Yet just such trade problems dominated the nation 's dealings with important allies last week . In Washington , William Eberle , President Nixon 's special representative for trade , pressed Ambassador Nobuhiko Ushiba for an agreement to lower Japanese tariffs , taxes or quotas on cars , computers , fruit and other U.S. goods . Then the abrasive-mannered Eberle jetted to Brussels to demand that Common Market officials let in more American citrus , tobacco and grain . He got some moral support from 15 members of the House Ways and Means Committee , who made a rare overseas jaunt to complain in Brussels about Common Market discrimination against U.S. farm exports . <P> The object of these efforts is to wring out some foreign trade concessions that President Nixon can boast about when he sends to Congress next month the bill formally devaluing the dollar-which came under renewed selling pressure in Europe last week . That , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the opening gun in a years-long campaign to expand American exports by rewriting many of the rules that govern - and now restrict-world trade . <P> The ideological underpinning of this drive is Nixon 's conviction that " economic power will be the key to other kinds of power " - and that the U.S. has been letting this key slip out of its hands . Speaking to a group of editors in Kansas City last year , Nixon said that " five great economic superpowers-the U.S. , Western Europe , the Soviet Union , Mainland China and , of course , Japan " will determine " the future of the world in the last third of this century . " He added that American world leadership " can only be maintained if the U.S. maintains its pre-eminent position in the economic field . " <P> Nixon is deeply impressed by a series of charts drawn up by Peter Peterson , his chief international economic adviser and the leading candidate to succeed Maurice Stans as Commerce Secretary soon . Peterson 's figures show that the U.S. position is eroding , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950 and 1970 fell from 39% to 30% . Its share of auto output dropped from 76% to 31% , of steel output from 46% to 20% , and its proportion of world exports from 16% to 14% . As recently as 1964 , U.S. exports ran $6.8 billion ahead of imports , but last year imports exceeded exports by about $2 billion . <P> This slippage reflects a panoply of causes : the strong recovery of war-shattered economies overseas during the 1950s , U.S. inflation and lagging productivity in recent years , and the shift of the American economy from one dominated by manufacturing to one in which 42% of output is now accounted for by services , which are less readily exportable than goods .
