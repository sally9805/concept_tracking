txt JERUSALEM  --  Israel tales pride in being the only democracy in the Middle East . After a visit to the parliament during President Carter 's trip here last week , one political wag noted that Israel had " the Middle East 's only democratically elected anarchy . " The visitor was commenting after a dozen parliamentary deputies fiercely heckled Prime Minister Menachem Begin , who took the podium after Carter 's address to the house . Begin was heckled so furiously that the house speaker ejected one deputy front the session and warned others they would follow unless they restrained themselves . The comments from the floor did n't cease . The place of each member in the 120-member parliament is equipped with a microphone to facilitate what the Israelis call " debate . " 15 ' 111LE MANY Israelis cringed in shame over the shouting and theatrics during Begin 's address , others say the display revived a spirit of the way things were in the early days of parliament and Israeli statehood , when passion and politics went hand in hand . They say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ed them of Begin as a young parliamentarian , when he would speak out against the policies of the late premier , David Ben-Gurion . As a 30-year era in Israeli politics comes to an end , veteran parliamentarians grow nostalgic for the old days . They remember the time Ben-Gorton gripped tile podium and lectured the house on Israel 's need to expand immigration and bolster the army against the growing Arab threat . " A PROUD AND FREE Jewish nation can survive only if ... . " His words were cut short by the sudden crash of a window shattering and the tinkle of falling glass . It was n't a terrorist attack or the opening shots of another Mideast war . It was the neighborhood kids again , playing stanga sandlot soccer in the street outside the Knesset parliament building . One had scored what the children called " a show stopper "  --  a long , arch // Israel 's parliament an ' elected anarchy ' // ing ball that punched through the Knesset window , interrupted crucial slate debates , and brought the irate parliamentarians into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the early ' 80s , Israel 's parliament , the revered symbol of Jewish sovereignty and democracy , was just part of the neighborhood . Directly across the street , there was a doctor who performed illegal abortions . The street itself constantly flowed with dirty washwater . In the adjoining building a butcher enraged religious neighbors by selling non-kosher meat . TODAY , Israelis call It . " the Old Kneeset " ? the simple stone building at the lop of Jerusalem 's King George Road that served as the official seat of the Israeli government until the modern Knesset was built in 1964 . For the parliamentarians who served then , the Old Knesset was a place of mission , the house where Israel took its first steps . For the families whose balconies overlooked the Knesset plenary , it provided one of the greatest shows on earth . " It was very primitive then . We were actually renting space in the old house , because there was no official Knesset building , " recalls Dr. Yohanan Bader , 76 , one of the nation 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the neighborhood . " I suppose it was more like an old European synagog than a parliament , but there was a sense of wonder at the beginning . We were making laws , passing legislation creating an honest-to-God state for the Jews for the first time in 2,000 years . Everything we did was a first . " WIIII.E BADER remembers the emotions that the first Knesset sessions evoked , neighbors recall white-skinned old men in open farm shirts and khaki shorts shouting the country 's landmark legislation into the streets during stormy , endless parliamentary debates . " You did n't need a radio back then , " said Amnon Dankner , who grew up across the street . " I remember sitting on our balcony , watching the Knesset debates and hearing all kinds of foreign affairs and security information that only years later did I realize was secret . " Dankner also remembers the times when he dropped bags of water on the heads of bald parliamentarians and his neighborhood record of seven show-stoppers . Dankner grew up to become Allon 's spokesman . Katz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whenever foreign dignitaries visited Israel , the Secet Service men would come to our apartmeat and tell us not to drop any water , " said David Kolitz , Dankner 's neighborhood friend . " But we bombed them anyway . Once we nailed Yigai Alton , " who later served as the country 's foreign minister . WATER BOMBS were n't the only ' things thrown at Knesset members . In October , 1957 , a deranged Jewish immigrant from Iraq hurled a hand grenade from the visitors gallery onto the government table where Ben-Gurion and his ministers sat . The blast wounded Ben-Gurion and two ministers , the only casualties in the history of the Knesset . There was almost one other Knesset casualty during the October , 1973 , war . Parliamentarian Meir Wittier of the Moscow-aligned Israeli Communist Party was using the floor to deliver a scathing , anti-Zionist speech when Likud member Matatyahu Drobless , an undistinguished back-bencher , stormed the podium and demanded that Wither retract his remarks . WHEN THE Communist refused , Drobless seized him by the throat and began choking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the years , ushers have been called in to remove self-enthralled parliamentarians from the podium after they ignored orders from the house speaker to relinquish the floor . Once in 1968 , former leftwing member Uri Avnery was lugged off , held aloft horizontally above the heads of three Knesset bouncers , Avnery continued his harangue all the way back to his seat , finishing just as they plopped him into his chair . Demonstrations outside the Knesset were frequent during the early years of Israel 's statehood , DURING THE harsh decade of austerity and unemployment in the 1950s , a small knot of dark-skinned Oriental Jews gathered daily outside the Knesset to chant for " bread and labor . " Dankner remembers the first time police used a water cannon in Israel ? on 5,000 religious women who gathered to protest a law that required the conscription of women into the army . " It was like watching a bunch of hens get washed down with a hose , " Dankner says . In 1964 , the parliament moved to its new home on a hilltop near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tourism ministry . " The atmosphere was suddenly different . Members stopped wearing shorts and started dressing up fancy , " says Bader .
