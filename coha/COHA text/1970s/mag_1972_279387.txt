" Dear Editor , " the letter began : <P> " Does ' Young , Black convict graduates from major university without ever leaving prison ' appear newsworthy to you ? I 've actually lived the above story , and if it appears that I 'm tooting my own horn , please realize that my circumstances ( being confined ) leave me no alternative ... " <P> With this bold declaration , mailed to various periodicals ( including TIME ) , Victor Taylor , 28 , announced his impending graduation , magna cum laude , from Southern Illinois University . He did indeed have a story to tell . A high school dropout from Dallas , he joined the Navy , tried to become a pilot but was disqualified for color blindness . That made him so " disenchanted with Navy life , " as he put it , that he robbed a naval-station bank of $125,000 and ended with a ten-year prison term . <P> Paroled in 1967 , he continued , " I went on a robbery spree which netted me an aggregate of 61 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta and Oklahoma City ; twice he was recaptured . Finally he was sent to the federal penitentiary in Marion , Ill .. , a maximum-security prison known as " the new Alcatraz . " <P> There he learned in group-encounter sessions that " I was the type of guy who always placed or showed but never won . In almost every project I ever undertook , I 'd get very close to finishing it and then I 'd abandon it . I 'd never even read a book all the way through . " Instructors from John A. Logan College in Carterville , Ill .. , paid regular visits to the prison , so Taylor signed up for six courses , including biology , math and Western civilization . He got straight A 's . Encouraged , he moved on into black studies , logic , electronics and criminology-all courses specially sent to him by Southern Illinois . S.I.U. waived tuition and provided tapes of lectures . Taylor chose psychology as his major , " mainly because I wanted to discover what made me tick . " <P> Finding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Taylor regularly slept from 5:30 p.m. until midnight , then studied until 7:30 a.m. , when he had to go to work in the prison 's education department . He earned a grade average of 4.89 out of a possible 5 , and finished four years ' studies in 21 months -a record for the university . <P> Because of his two escape attempts , prison authorities refused to let Taylor go to the university to receive his diploma , so S.I.U. sent two officials to the prison cafeteria to present it to him . " This diploma means a hell of a lot to me , " Taylor said . " This diploma makes me feel I can do anything . " Then tears started to run down his cheeks . Taylor recalled that he had n't cried since he was 13 . " But this year I cried when my father died . And now this . This must be my year for crying . " <P> Taylor has already begun working by correspondence on a doctorate in clinical psychology . The problem is that he can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not eligible for parole until 1976 , and he can not even get to a class unless he can convince the authorities that " I am not the wild man I once appeared to be . " To do that , he may figure that the best method is a loud toot on the horn .
