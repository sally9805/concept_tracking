Next door to Number One Safdarjang Road is another low , thick-walled white bungalow . The gardens of the two houses are adjoined . It is just after eight o'clock one September morning . The gate between Number One , the second house on the block , and this corner garden , is still closed . On the lawns several groups of men and women are seated on carpets near the path . In the " receiving " bungalows , kept exclusively for this purpose , other groups of individuals wait . Another day , another darshan ( a kind of audience or receiving of petitioners ) is beginning for the Prime Minister of India . As the green gate between the two gardens swings open , the small figure wrapped in the yellow hand-loomed sari seems almost Biblical . Seen from closer up , the short dark hair with its broad streak of white rising from the center of the widow 's peak and the dominant nose seem more suggestive of a Roman senator .

The barshan , to which any person can come , is held most mornings of the week . This morning , for about an hour and a half , she listens to problems ranging , from sacred cows to police brutality . To the group protecting sacred cows she says that it is up to the people  --  not the government  --  to stop stray cattle from doing damage . A group of villagers from a place near Delhi is there ; she listens to the spokesmen  --  fine-looking old soldiers wearing breastfuls of medals and holding themselves ramrod straight . She swallows a glass of cold water down in one gulp and tells them that already a thorough investigation has been made into the death of the old lady in question and that the state legislature has debated the matter .

The minister of rehabilitation and supply brings his sister to meet the Prime Minister . She stands with a group of pilgrims and their Hindu sadhus , for pictures . A vociferous woman petitioner tries to present her with a sari , which she gives back . The red and white length of material goes back and forth several times as the woman tries to get her way .

" For goodness ' sake send them away . The Americans will think that the Prime Minister 's house eats all the grain .... " But Nehru 's daughter makes no jokes . She smiles occasionally , usually at a child or a woman . She is straight-backed and reserved , as she walks back from the darshan into her own garden . She agrees to send for her animals , to have her picture taken with them but warns that they are not very disciplined . Zorba , the Siamese cat , leaps off and escapes .

Mrs. Gandhi 's house is a modest , solid house , . built , like the others on the same street , in the 1920 's for British officials of the Indian Civil Service ( which was neither Indian , nor civil nor service , Indians used to joke ) . The trees are neems and jamans . The lawns are coarse but green , and well established . There is a lily pond protected by palings , to keep her grandchildren out of danger . A bust of her , in stone . A Japanese garden where she reads , when there is time . Inside the house , the decor is simple but comfortable . Among the books in her study can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the books of her father Jawaharlal Nehru , 1001 Ways to Improve Your Conversation and Speeches ( her critics say she needs to ) and Elizabeth Borgese 's Ascent of Women . Her two sons share the house . The eldest , Rajiv Gandhi , is thirty , and a pilot with the domestic Indian Airlines , flying Boeing 737 's . His Italian bride , Sonia , and their two children , Rahul , four , and Priyanka , two , seem to represent warmth in an otherwise chilly political existence . There is a photograph of Sonia in Indira Gandhi 's study . She buys gifts for her daughter-in-law when she travels . There is clearly none of the traditional **29;3643;TOOLONG tension endemic to Indian families with their intimate sharing of the same household . Perhaps being Italian , the beautiful Sonia had a love of family proximity that would provide a good foundation for being a daughter-in-law in an Indian household . Not that it is a typical one in any regard . " Sonia is an exceedingly nice person , " Mrs. Gandhi says . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but adds : " Nothing has cropped up that could cause a quarrel ... actually I do n't impinge on their life at all because , as you see , I 'm out most of the time and even when the children were small I regarded them as adults .

" Rajiv and Sonia and their children occupy one of the three large bedrooms , Mrs. Gandhi another , and her younger and controversial son Sanjay , twenty-eight , the third . Soon Sanjay will bring seventeen-year-old Menaka Anand , the daughter of a cabinet secretariat staffer , to the house as his bride .

Occasionally she gives a small dinner . " I usually do the flowers , if there are any in the garden . Or if there are none , I still do them because I have to manage with what there is .... " She does not like spicy food , or too much food . Friends recall that her father loved food , and she would often say , " No , Papu " if she thought he was eating more than was good for him .

In fact the coarse woven khadi cloth sari suits her particular handsomeness far more than the softness of silk . Indira Nehru was born in 1917 , in the family house " Anand Bhavan " ( House of Joy ) in Allahabad . The family , originally a Kashmiri Brahmin clan called Kaul , had several generations earlier earned the name " Nehru , " a corruption of the word " Nehar , " or canal ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her grandfather and a successful barrister of Allahabad , was a vivid personality who built a fine bungalow , served French wines at his table and ate in western style from fine china and cutlery . His elder brother , Bansi Dhar , had attended Queen Victoria 's Diamond Jubilee in London and had an audience with President McKinley in Washington . In 1911 , when his only son Jawaharlal was studying in Britain , Motilal was invited to a durbar for King George V in Delhi . He cabled his son to send court dress . As Krishnan Bhatia relates in his biography , Indira , Jawaharlal wrote back : " I suppose you want the ordinary levee dress with sword and everything complete . The shoes for the court dress will be made at Knighton 's and the gloves at Travellette 's ... the hats I am sending ought to fit you . Heath 's man has managed to fish out your old measures and cast and he will shape your hats accordingly . " By 1917 , however , the forces of history were changing Motilal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , active in the independence movement . Motilal was slowly changing his lifestyle and following his son 's path . Jawaharlal was twenty-eight . His bride , Kamala , from a Kashmiri Brahmin family also , was eighteen . They had been married twenty months and she was pregnant . She had been persuaded by Motilal not to go to her own home for the birth , as was the custom . He wanted to offer the services of the best British doctors , and it was a Scotsman who delivered Indira . According to Bhatia 's research , Indira 's grandmother was supposed to have expressed disappointment because she was a girl . Motilal , angered by this prejudice , is said to have replied : " Have we made any distinction between our son and our daughters in their upbringing ? Do you not love them equally ? This daughter of Jawahar , for all you know , may prove better than a thousand sons . " The poet Sarojini Naidu is said to have called Jawaharlal 's daughter " The New Soul of India " ? a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the years that followed , her father spent a total of ten years in jail , imprisoned by the British . Kamala , too , frequently had to go to jail , and her frailty brought on tuberculosis . Indira , born in the year of the Russian Revolution , was a lonely child . The fight for freedom involved more and more of the family . Mahatma Gandhi was a major influence in her childhood . As a child , Indira did not have a British governess , as her aunts had had . Thus the Westernization process was avoided , her Hindi idiom fostered , and she grew up thinking like an Indian . When she was four , Anand Bhavan was given up , In accordance with Gandhi 's creed of austerity , Motilal built a smaller house in the grounds . Indira was an only child , and lonely . She was insecure , she admits , because of the almost continual absence of her parents . Their letters were loving  --  in fact there is deep poignancy in the quality of the love between Indira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her mother , Kamala , was treated badly by Motilal 's wife Swarup Rani and her daughter Vijayalakshmi , who later became known to the world as Madame Pandit . This was a cause of sadness to the young Indira , which might explain her own determination not to make her son 's wife feel like an outsider , as her mother was Continued on page 84 // made to feel . Vijayalakshmi , apparently , had no interest in Indira . These two factors and others ( " When Nehru died it was more important to be his forty-eight-year-old daughter than his sixty-year-old sister , " a member of the family says ) probably account for the enmity between the two women today . Indira 's other aunt , Krishna Hutheesing , however , remained a friend and wrote a hook entitled Dear To Behold before she died in 1967 . The title is based on Indira 's other name-given by her parents - Priyadarshina - which means " Dear to Behold . " Kamala 's distress at her treatment by the two older women in the Nehru household made some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days was increased by regular police raids and the confiscation of the family 's goods , which infuriated Indira . She says today , " As a young girl I was a terribly angry person . " At the age of five , when the Nehru family was making a symbolic bonfire of British-made goods , someone told her that her doll was British-made . After days of thinking it over , she made her own bonfire and burned her beloved doll . As a child , she played at the politics that surrounded her . Dolls would enact scenes from her imagination . . . such as a demonstration between dolls dressed in red turbans and dolls in pith helmets . Significantly , one of her childhood heroines was Joan of Arc . Her aunt Krishna tells how one day she found Indira addressing an imaginary audience . " I am practicing to be Joan of Arc , " she said . There were travels to Switzerland , where her mother needed treatment for tuberculosis . She enjoyed the International School in Geneva , learned to ski , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health of her mother . In 1937 , after her mother 's death in Switzerland , she went to Oxford . Smith College in the States had been considered as a possibility , but as Feroze Gandhi , whom she was to marry , was studying at the London School of Economics , she chose Oxford . In 1939 , in the blitz , she served in the Red Cross . But India beckoned , and without finishing her B.A. she-and Feroze Gandhi headed for home . In 1942 , amidst great outcries from Hindus because she was marrying a Parsi , she wedded the budding politician who had been such a friend and admirer of her mother . ( While his name was the same as the Mahatma 's , he was no relation to the Hindu leader . ) By all accounts , she was deeply in love . For their honeymoon , the couple went to Kashmir . They found themselves in jail - Indira 's first time shortly after . Indira was in jail for six months . Feroze was released several months later . They set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1946 , they moved to Lucknow and their second child was born . When Betty Friedan asked her to pinpoint the particular moment in her life when she was drawn into politics in her own right , Mrs. Gandhi recalled standing in for her father in a campaign speech for a woman candidate . She found that people listened to her . Fatalistically she adds : " The good Indian would say it was not in my stars to he that little housewife . " Feroze did not disapprove . " I am so intense in whatever I do he must have been frightened to have it all concentrated on him . " Her father was Prime Minister by then . She felt he needed her at his side , as his hostess , and so began several years of commuting between husband and father . By the end of 1948 , she was spending most of her time near her father . Feroze was tiring of his newspaper in Lucknow , so he ran for Parliament . During the later years of their marriage , the two drifted apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and companion . Feroze became critical of Nehru in Parliament . He also felt that the Prime Minister 's life and that of Indira removed them too far from the masses . Ile was first amused but later angered to be known as " the nation 's son-in-law . " In 1959 , when Indira teased him about how he 'd feel to he married to the president of the Congress Party-to which she 'd been appointed hebecame so upset that " it took weeks to win him over , " she told one biographer . Mrs. Gandhi decided not to cept a second term of party leadership , Her husband had suffered a heart attack in 1959 . She wanted to spend more time caring for him . " Toward the end , " she said , " we were somehow getting very close . " They had a " nearly perfect " holiday together . In September 1960 , Feroze suffered a heart attack while sitting in Parliament , He died before Indira could return from a South Indian tour , asking for her constantly . For many months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and mind shocked . Looking back at that time , in an interview afterward , she told a journalist : " I did not have less love . I think my husband gave very deeply to me and I to him . I think giving is what makes for happiness . I do not think he would have been the person he was if he 'd been married to the sweet little woman in an Indian movie . He would have been just an ordinary husband . I think this conflict helped him grow also . Conflict and unhappiness are not the worst things that can happen . It is all the experience that one has that makes one what one is the wider the experience the stronger one 's personality . " To achieve some understanding of Indira Gandhi at present , a thorough look at her past is essential . Like India itself she is something of an enigma to the Western world . She is not easy with the press , and does not charm by her wit or eccentricity or ideas . In pictures of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the smiling grace of her old role can be seen - the role of her father 's hostess during important years of India 's life , which served as such a unique apprenticeship . Then she observed without participation . Today she is the host , and there is neither femininity nor masculinity in her . She seems asexual . Despite the attractiveness of her figure and her severe beauty , she is not only the celibate widow but the abstemious sadhu . Accusing her of autocratic use of power , critics call her the " Empress of India . " But to the masses , perhaps she seems more like a contemporary goddess -a mixture of Shiva 's wife , Parvati , who won him by becoming an ascetic . And of that other version of Parvati , Kali , the warrior , with weapons in her hands . " Being idol worshippers , we need some idol or other to worship , " one Indian says . She puts down this notion firmly : " I do n't think so . I think some people tried to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much a contrived sort of thing . The thing is I 've worked amongst the people since I was very small . After my father became Prime Minister-except for the first few years when the boys were very small -I was traveling all over , when my father could n't . So I got to know the people and they inc . And they feel that , whatever my other faults , at least sincere motivation is there . " The time is later in the day . All morning , her outer office at Parliament House has been buzzing with cabinet ministers and MP 's , messengers and secretaries . Men in the dhotis of the south , round-faced Assamese concerned about floods , her Sikh foreign minister Swaran Singh on the verge of departing for Moscow but tied up with Sikkim , which has just " requested " ( many use the word ironically ) to join India as an associate state . The Lok Sabha ( House of Representatives ) begins with a long continuous bell at II a.m . A few moments later there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lok Sabha ) over a licensing controversy involving MP 's . A great babble of angry voices comes over one of the twin loudspeakers ( the other is from the Rajya Sabha , or the Senate ) . The parliamentary secretary bustles into the Prime Minister 's office . A few moments later the session is adjourned for an hour while the government and the opposition try to come to terms about when the license issue will be debated . By noon her private secretary , a plump , good-natured man , is telling someone on the phone , " If something has been solved she will not go to the Lok Sabha chamber . But if nothing has been solved , she will go . " Other phrases drift around that outer office , as the fan whirls above and thirteen men in various white Indian costumes and three handsome , confident women MP 's ( there are fifty-five in the two houses ) wait to see Mrs. Gandhi . " This is what she said : she told him , ' If you do n't stop I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house ... " In the Prime Minister 's secretariat , there is a staff of some 220 . At her house , the staff numbers around 60 ? gardeners , cooks , maintenance man . Her salary is three thousand rupees a month , or about $400 . Her take-home pay , after taxes , is precisely 1,938 rupees , or $250 . She also pays taxes on her income from her father 's royalties . During the seven months of the year that Parliament sits , she occupies this parliamentary office . She has another office , that of the leader of the government , in the huge red sandstone Central Secretariat , designed by Lutyens . A large slice of her year is spent traveling around the country  --  speaking at rallies , fortifying her stunning 1971 post-Bangladesh landslide ( when she called an election two years earlier than she needed , an example of what friend and foe acknowledge as her incredible sense of timing ) . There is no constitutional time limit upon the office . Her father was Prime Minister for sixteen years . Diplomats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she 's not given to discussion or argument . " There 's not much feedback , " a Delhi diplomat says . " That 's her strength : nobody knows what she 's thinking , " says an Indian journalist . Senator Charles Percy , a friend both of India and Mrs. Gandhi , recalls meeting her years ago at a weekend house party given by John D. Rockefeller III . " I sat next to her at dinner and she was really uncommunicative . There were just yeses , or nos , and not much more . I thought it was going to be a difficult weekend . But the next morning we met early and her first words were an enthusiastic , " Oh , Mr. Percy , I 'm so glad you are an early riser too . " Their friendship took off from that point . Asked about this unresponsiveness , she smiles : " It 's true . People  --  especially in the past got used to a lot of speculation and gossip . And I just do n't want to comment on that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomat it 'll get reported hack ! If politicians want to discuss some third party , I do n't ; if it 's only policy matters then I think I 'm more forthcoming than most . But often when they ask about problems in a state ... anything you say will be tinged by that person 's opinion . And sometimes if I have decided , ' Well , this is my opinion ; why not say it ? ' ? it 's appeared in the press in a way that it was not intended . " She says when she first became Prime Minister , she had no doubts about what she had to offer . " It 's difficult to put into words , but when one 's standards are very high , one feels , ' Well , I 'm so far away from what I should be .. .. ' But it does n't mean that you think that other people have attained that standard either . Also the situation came about in such a way that there was n't much choice . Once you accepted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or could n't . You just had to get on with it . " She is not as interested in foreign affairs as her father was . She does not see herself as a Third World leader . " I 've no inclination for that , " she says . She thinks she may have met President Ford , as a member of a congressional delegation in the 50 's , but is not sure . " If they came to see my father I 'd have received them collectively but not individually . " The rapport she had with Lyndon Johnson " and some of the other presidents " did not affect U.S. policy , she feels . " Basically the U.S. administration did n't approve of our policy and this was far more important than any personal rapport . Now that the U.S. has come around to what we 've been saying all along ... that you can have different aims and objectives and in spite of that still have friendship , as they have now with China , perhaps ... " But she does n't seem convinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't consider it very important in what they call their global strategy . " And she adds quietly about relations with the United States : " Now I do n't know what the block is .... " Asked if she gets depressed , Mrs , Gandhi admits she does : " But not overwhelmingly depressed . Our newspapers and opposition party paint a far grimmer picture than it is . I think if you see the picture in perspective , then there 's no cause for that kind of depression . Things are had . There are bad patches and phases . But there 's no time for deep depression , either in hours or psychological terms . It would be counterproductive . " Going out to a mass meeting ? " Having the people come up with flowers , touching me " ? revives her when she is depressed . She points out that even amidst inflation , drought and famine , " We did n't allow anyone to die , even though there was terrible hardship . " She is not religious . " If I go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it , I 'm interested to see it . And also I do n't want to hurt their feelings . " Then she adds , " The Hindu religion does n't believe in a personal God ? so you can be a Hindu and an agnostic . Because basically what it says is that there is some force ... which exists in people , in animals and so on . " This woman , leader of the world 's largest democracy , admired by a vast majority of India 's 550 million citizens , disliked by many of the middle class , is never criticized because of her sex . There are no off-color jokes in the bazaars about her , a diplomat says . " She exemplifies the fact that sex has nothing to do with power in politics or in business , " Senator Percy observes . " She 's the only man in the cabinet , " cracks one of the perennial Delhi jokes .

" She believes that India is a " favorite whipping boy " in the West . accused of being a flabby democracy and simultaneously of being cynical . tough and power-hungry . " Both images ca n't be true , " she protested to an American interviewer earlier this year . But she admits that Auhrey Menen 's quotation of a young Indian communist a few years ago is perceptive : " There 's no denying she understands the people .

Those who admire her think she has achieved a great deal , under continuingly difficult circumstances . Those who do not , accuse her of being variously cold , incompetent , calculating , simple , not practical enough - many contradictory things But if the symbols in India can he confusing , like the one conveying word that the nuclear test was successful ( " The Buddha is Smiling " - Buddhism is the ultimate in pacifism ) , if the politicians are often corrupt . as they often are elsewhere , it the Prime Minister is an enigma to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress Party has something to say .
