THE SUNDAY WOMAN <P> Directed by LUIGI COMENCINI <P> Screenplay by AGENORE INCROCCI and FURIO SCARPELLI <P> An aging , disreputable and thoroughly disagreeable architect is done in , bludgeoned to death with a stone phallus . Almost everyone questioned by Inspector Santamaria ( Marcello Mastroianni ) has a fair disposition for murder and a shaky alibi . Nobody liked the recently deceased much , but snobbism is an unpersuasive reason for murder . The inspector , then , must search out not only a culprit but a motive . <P> The Sunday Woman is a double-barreled puzzle , about which one does not know whodunit and one does not care either . The movie , steadfastly hare brained , has an unreasonably attractive cast : Jacqueline Bisset , elegant and wry as a bored member of Turin high society ; Jean-Louis Trintignant , absorbed and enigmatic all the way through the part of a bisexual aristocrat . Mastroianni continues to be as relaxed as a sleep walker , as unruffled as a cat on the prowl . His shrugs are funnier than the dialogue he is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The ennui of the mystery is relieved , on occasion , by quick intravenous jabs of humor . At one point , Trintignant yells at a demanding male lover , " I gave up women because they 're ball breakers - but you 're worse ! " A beleaguered civil servant , his massive family wedged into a small car for vacation , wonders if a last-minute phone call concerned his ailing mother-in-law ; then he hears the old lady pipe up " I 'm here " from somewhere in the crowd between the back seat and the trunk . The Sunday Woman does not contain enough of these modest jokes to call them saving graces . They are more like simple amenities . <P> J. C.
