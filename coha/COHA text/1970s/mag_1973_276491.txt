At first there was only the smell of smoke . Robert Bemish , 43 , a San Francisco broadcasting executive , opened the door of his eighth-floor room at New Orleans ' Howard Johnson 's Motor Lodge to investigate , and noticed " light bulbs popping all over the place " from the heat . He was standing facing the motel 's swimming pool when a black youth with a rifle jumped out from some bushes , stared at him for a full second , took aim and fired . Shot through his midsection , Bemish fell into the pool . He pretended to be dead , his air-filled trench coat providing just enough buoyancy to keep him above water . <P> Soon shots were ringing out from several other floors of the motel , and smoke began pouring from half a dozen balconies . One newly married couple were killed in a corridor while clutching each other in a death embrace . A fireman ascending a ladder to the tenth floor was shot . The assistant manager of the motel , investigating reports of fire , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis Sirgo , 48 , the city 's deputy police superintendent , as he led a search through the motel . <P> Even in a period of increasing terrorism , it was a startling explosion of violence . When it was over , six people were dead and nine wounded . The episode was reminiscent of Charles Whitman 's homicidal outburst from the top of Austin 's Texas Tower , but last week 's madness seemed to have more method . The victims were all white , and seven-three dead , four wounded-were policemen . <P> Super-brain . For hours , police had no idea how many snipers they were up against , but there seemed to be at least two , since blazes were set almost simultaneously on different floors . A besieging army of 200 uniformed policemen , detectives , sharpshooters and volunteers soon surrounded the motel . As the cordon tightened , the assailants found refuge behind the concrete walls of the rooftop 's boiler room and stairwell casements . An armor-plated Marine helicopter made repeated passes as the cops tried to blast through the walls , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the violence had begun , one lone sniper darted under the glare of a helicopter spotlight , ran about 30 ft. in a zigzag pattern across the rooftop , and fell dead in a hail of police tracer bullets , his body riddled with more than 100 slugs . <P> Convinced that other gunmen were still on the roof , police kept their vigil throughout the night and the next morning . When they finally raided the rooftop , they found just the body of the youth they had shot down 16 hours earlier . A thorough room-by-room search of the motel failed to turn up any other snipers . Said Police Superintendent Clarence Giarrusso : " Either there was only one , or another got away . The speculation might run the gamut all the way from negligence on the part of police to a superbrain on the part of the sniper . "
