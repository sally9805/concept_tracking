When the aging college president retired , he did not give his successor any advice , but instead left four numbered envelopes with instructions to open them in sequence as campus crises arose . Sure enough , trouble came soon , and the young chief executive opened the first envelope . The message inside : " Balance your budget . " When new problems developed , the president twice more consulted his silent mentors . " Form a committee , " read the second note ; " Make a new five-year plan , " said the third . After a period of relative calm , another crisis ensued , and the president , after opening the fourth envelope , slumped in his chair . The suggestion : " Prepare four envelopes . " <P> When this apocryphal tale was told at a recent conference of small college presidents , it was greeted with uneasy laughter . The fourth envelope is often too close at hand . Given the problems in higher education-entrenched faculties , rising expenses , enrollments expected to fall-college presidents can no longer expect long terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three to five years . <P> This year 112 colleges are getting new presidents .

Brown offers all of those . " Indeed , it does . The 213-year-old school has suffered through a variety of ailments the past few years-a deficit of $10.6 million since 1970 , student strikes , minority student protests . His principal goal , says Swearer , is " to encourage the various constituencies to work together to determine what the institution 's priorities are , and then put those priorities above those of their own constituency . " High on Swearer 's list of priorities is a fund-raising campaign-Brown 's $98 million endowment is relatively small by Ivy League standards . He also wants to find a method of minimizing the danger of necessary reduction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually the younger , untenured faculty who are let go , and it is important , says Swearer , that those older , tenured teachers who remain do not get stale . One innovation that Swearer is considering : summer institutes for new teaching and research techniques , training in related academic disciplines and guidance in searching out other vocations.
