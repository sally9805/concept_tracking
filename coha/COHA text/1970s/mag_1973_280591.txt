" Why , I could do a better job with a troop of Boy Scouts , " says Everett Wai-drop , a burly , tattooed carpenter whose sons Donald , 17 , and Jerry , 15 , were among the victims of Dean CorH 's sex-murder orgies . Like other anguished parents , he is bitter about the failure of the Houston police to recognize that something strange had been going on in the Heights section of the city-and to do something about it . Waldrop charges that 13 boys disappeared from the same neighborhood around the same time in early 1971 , but that the police were lax in searching for his sons . <P> " We anticipated the criticism , " says Inspector H.D. Caldwell , Chief of Staff Services ( which includes the Juvenile Missing Persons ) for the Houston police . " Someone must be found to assume the blame . " But , says Houston Police Chief Herman Short , " This kind of disgusting attempt at scapegoating compounds an already tragic incident . " <P> In fact , Houston police records show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Heights section , just a small fraction of the thousands of runaways reported in the city every year . David Hilligiest , believed to be one of the still-unidentified victims , has been missing-and the object of an agonizing search by his parents-for more than two years . " We 're hanging on the thread that our son is still alive , " says Fred Hilligiest . Of the 5,228 juveniles who took off last year , the police say , only 424 , or 8% , remain unaccounted for today , despite the fact that some parents wait for days and even months before reporting that their children are missing . Many , like the parents of another victim , Marty Jones , never report them at all . For instance , Horace Lawrence , whose son Billy , 15 , was one of the victims , tearfully confesses that he never alerted the police ; he thought that Billy was in Austin playing in a rock band . Although runaways are not official police business in Texas ( because , as in most states , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force maintains a round-the-clock juvenile missing-persons desk ; 90 officers are available to investigate runaway cases . <P> Other American cities report that they too have the runaway problem under control . New York City police say they solve 95% of the 13,000 cases they process annually . Chicago dealt with 16,500 missing youths last year and solved 99.5% of the cases . Los Angeles has now cleared 90% of the 7,601 Cases reported in 1972 . <P> Even so , the number of juvenile runaways seems to be going up across the nation . The FBI reports that 164,000 runaways were taken into custody ( most are then simply returned to their parents ) in 1972 , compared with only 1 18,000 in 1967 . ( Ironically , the number of runaway cases in Houston declined almost 10% between 1971 and 1972 . ) Because most runaways are not reported missing , authorities estimate the U.S. total last year at 1,000,000.
