At a Saturday-night Mass in the Scheveningen maximum-security prison in The Netherlands , four prisoners interrupted the singing of the hymns . Brandishing two pistols and several spring knives that they had smuggled in , they took captive the choir and members of their families , the organist , a priest and two unarmed guards-22 people in all . <P> What followed was a suspense story with enough tension , surprise and heroism to make a palpable TV hit . One of the rebellious prisoners , for instance , was Adnan Ahmed Nuri , a Palestinian terrorist who was serving five years for hijacking and burning a British Airways VC-10 last March . Actually , the instigators were two Dutch criminals who were doing time for robbery . The fourth prisoner , an Algerian also convicted of robbery , appeared to be simply tagging along . With the Palestinian as front man , the quartet demanded , as the price for their hostages , a plane that would carry them to any Arab country and the release of another Palestinian in the prison hospital . <P> Dutch police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorists last September , this time refused to buckle and quietly drew up plans of their own . They got together a team of four psychologists and two psychiatrists , who gave them round-the-clock advice on how they should deal with the emotionally unstable prisoners . It was the team 's idea to give in to all the minor demands of the convicts and stall on all the major ones , waiting for them to wear out under the strain . When the convicts least expected it , the psychologists advised , the police should do something to create maximum confusion-and then burst through the doors . <P> Magnesium Grenades . That was all the help the police needed , and at 4 a.m. last Thursday , 104 hours after the mini-revolt began , they acted . Magnesium grenades were thrown through the chapel windows , temporarily stunning and blinding everyone inside . The outer doors were quietly unlocked , and the lock on the inner door was cut with acetylene torches , a process that took only ten seconds . Fifteen marines burst through , disarming the convicts before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four-day drama took only 15 minutes . The hostages were all in good health and cheerily waved at newsmen as they were driven away , eager , no doubt , to forget the whole thing-at least until they see it re-enacted on the home screen .
