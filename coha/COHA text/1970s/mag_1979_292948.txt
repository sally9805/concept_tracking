A rested Jimmy Carter pursues new campaigns <P> The son of Georgia had renewed his tan in Georgia 's sun . His ten-day vacation on isolated Sapelo Island had been so relaxing that he wants to make it a regular refreshment stand . His jogs along the Atlantic had tightened a stomach already impressively taut for a man of 54 . He had even cultivated a new hair style by shifting his part from right to left . And , as Jimmy Carter returned to the White House last week , he was in an upbeat mood , telling intimates that the nation 's political climate was finally turning in his favor . Said one : " He knows that others do n't see it that way yet , but that 's how Jimmy feels . He thinks they 'll come around .

And though at week 's end negotiations between Washington and Moscow led to an exchange of five Soviet dissidents for two Soviet spies held in the U.S. , the long stalled SALT negotiations remained stalled on the very edge of completion . <P> Undaunted by the array of difficulties confronting him , Carter plunged into his most active week since his diplomatic triumph in the Middle East . Carrying out a promise to Israel 's Premier Menachem Begin , he went to the rotunda of the Capitol to attend a solemn ceremony in remembrance of the victims of the Nazi Holocaust . As former Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg wept openly , the President declared that it was fitting to " remember the terrible price paid for bigotry and hatred and also the terrible price paid for indifference and for silence . " Carter said that he had vowed " to reaffirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this earth again . " The only way to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust , he said , was to " harness the outrage of our memories to banish all human oppression from the world . "
