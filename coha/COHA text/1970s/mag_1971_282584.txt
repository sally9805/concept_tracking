One of advertising 's hardiest conceits is that its TV commercials are better than the programs they punctuate . Trouble is , so many commercials are punctuating home-screen viewing these days that the messages blur into one another and are often lost . Now a Pittsburgh-based ad agency , Ketchum , MacLeod &; Grove , thinks that it has found a way around the get-lost problem . To grab more attention for a bank in the Houston area , the agency is running the first commercials for commercials . <P> Usually during the TV news shows , a craggy-faced middle-aged male model flashes onscreen . " In a few minutes , ' ' he says confidentially , " you are going to see a commercial for Texas Commerce Bank . I have a leading role in this commercial , and you will see me run down a very long corridor . The director made me run down that corridor 18 times . TV is a tough business . " At the next commercial break , sure enough , the model appears . Now he is a bank manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bank now has $1 billion in trust . Manager and teller go into a slow-motion dance to the strains of Tchaikovsky 's Romeo and Juliet . <P> The agency produced two 30-sec. commercials for its commercials . Tony Wake , the Ketchum vice president who dreamed up the idea , had little trouble selling it to the bank 's officials , despite the cost of the extra promotions . In advertising , where few hesitate to imitate , the idea could well lead to a plethora of plugs plugging plugs .
