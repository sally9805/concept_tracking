Ever since the great earthquake of 1906 , scientists have been predicting that the city of San Francisco , perched precariously over the San Andreas fault , would some day be hit by another devastating tremor . Reuben Greenspan , 69 , was not nearly so vague as that . Operating on a long-standing theory that certain relative positions of the sun and moon can exert catalytic-and predictable-pressures on the earth 's surface , Greenspan announced in 1971 that an earthquake would strike the city on Jan. 4 , 1973 at 9:20 a.m . Last week Greenspan delphically hedged on his prediction , saying he wanted to verify the data and did n't mean to upset anyone , but the idea remained quite unsettling . <P> Greenspan first won worldwide attention during the Depression ( TIME , July 22 , 1935 ) when he accurately forecast earthquakes in Chile , Peru , Japan and India , as well as a savage volcanic eruption in Krakatoa . He was more or less dismissed by the scientific community as a lucky crackpot . But he resurfaced within the past couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicting the time and date ( Feb. 9 , 1971 at 6 a.m. ) of the San Fernando earthquake that killed 64 people and wrought more than $500 million worth of damage . Greenspan has missed the mark before ; he has thrice predicted San Francisco earthquakes . Still , between the eerie San Fernando prognostication and the grisly events in Managua , Nicaragua , Bay Area dwellers entered the New Year preoccupied by some sobering thoughts .
