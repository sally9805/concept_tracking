RAT SONG A story by Lewis Nordan ISSY FIRST APPROACHES CS about the 4. rats . They are just the most darling things , she says , and may she bring them home for the weekend , all the kids are getting to take care of them over the weekend , and they ca n't just be left in the classroom to starve till Monday , can they , so ca n't I , please ? Rats ? I say . You mean hamsters ? or gerbils ? Well , sort of , she says . They 're in a hamster cage , and one of the kids in the split section of her learning pod ( which I take to mean the sixth grade ) donated them , you know , when her father was transferred back to California or somewhere , and now Miss Cheshire , our unit leader ( which 1 understand to mean teacher ) is lining up volunteers to keep them on weekends . so can I , please ? Rats ? her mother says . You mean mice ? White mice ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , not exactly white , but can she ? Oh , I love gerbils , her mother says . They 're so educational , and so natural . Well , I do n't know , I say . The fish were one thing  --  and I have to admit , I say . You 're doing a fine job with the fish , feeding them and so on  --  but white mice , I 'm not so sure . I love the rats , daddy , she assures me , I love them more than anyone else in the pod , more than the unit leader even , so ca n't I , daddy , please ? She will take full responsibility , she swears . Really . Have you fed the fish today ? I say impotently , vanquished with the word daddy , the first time she 's called me that since her mother decided Roy and Meredith sounded more mature than daddy and mommy . tA ISSY BRINGS THE RATS HOME , two of them . They sit on the top shelf of their yellow plastic hamster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not white . Are n't they beautiful ! Missy says . None of us can disagree with that , her mother says enthusiastically . Their fur , she says , is so thick and glossy , their eyes so  --  so vuhierable I am horrified by them . Everyone looks at me for a statement of approval so I manage to say , Very attractive pets , but I do n't think .. . Their names are Harriet Tubman and Diphtheria Jean Johnson , Missy tells us , two historical figures her pod has been studying . ( Exploring is actually the word she uses . ) Hirn , kind of super names for gerbils , her mother says seriously . My God , I think . My idea of boldness in education and child-rearing is letting Missy watch the black mollies give birth in the aquarium . Oh . this is nothing , her mother assures me in private as I gulp .1 &B.; You should have been in town last year when Missy 's pod went on a field trip to the large-animal clinic and helped foal a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ w ELL , ALL RIGHT , I think . The rats are in the house for the weekend , there is nothing I can do about that . And in any case , the beasts are caged , and besides that , I tell myself , it 's an old prejudice anyway , what if hamsters had been responsible for the plague ? or featured on Sixty Minutes as a commentary on inner-city living ? What if gerbils lived in barns and sewers and cut chickens ' throats and carried rabies ? Would n't we probably keep rats as pets and buy poison for the others ? Yes , but it 's the other way around , I reply logically and without feeling much comfort . ( It has taken me most of several months to get used to the fish . ) But now the fish , I remind myself , are another matter  --  I was certainly wrong about the fish . I have indeed grown accustomed to them and have even come to enjoy them , think them beautiful . Some of them anyway . And it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same might be true this weekend of the rats . I might become their champion . Well , no , not that , but it will work out , I tell myself , or at least it will be over soon enough and the rats will be back in the schoolroom where they belong . I look into the fish tank and tap lightly on the side of a yellow tin of fish food and watch the flakes drift down through the crystal water like snow . The algae-eater , a rock-colored fish I mistakenly contributed to the collection in a moment of familial zeal , has grown in a relatively short i time from the size of a finger joint to a great menacing beast of five or six inches , thick as a cigar . I watch him now , swimming his buzzardly way among the angels and mollies and tetras . He eats not only algae . he has eaten one of the snails , torpedoed it against the glass wall until it released its grip and fell to the bottom of the tank , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out . That was months ago . The thought comes back now as the hideous creature settles behind an electronically operated sea chest which pops open every ten seconds and reveals a grinning skeleton . The rats are placed in their cage on the second tier of a wood-inlaid table near the aquarium . They can be friends with the fish , Missy tells us. and introduces them by name . Oddly enough , the rats do seem interested in the fish . Look , my wife says cheerily , 1 think they notice each other . The rats sit on their shelf behind the yellow plastic , glaring at the fish and slowly grinding hunks of wilted lettuce between their teeth . Maybe they want to go for a swim with their new friends , my wife jokes prettily . Maybe they want to tear out their gills and drink their cold blood , I try to joke back , but no one laughs . I would gladly give them the algae-eating snail murderer . Yet , despite my prejudice against the beasts , the rest of the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than stare at the fish and eat lettuce . Missy changes the paper in their cage once , very handily and with genuine affection for the creatures inside . She strokes their necks and ears and calls them Harriet and Diphtheria , and sometimes Hattie and Dippy , and the rats respond gently to her touch , not stupidly like gerbils but more like house cats , turning their little heads to direct the passage of her finger over their bodies , then nuzzling their faces into her hand and into each other 's neck . Missy accepts their gentle behavior with delight . You must admit .... her mother says , looking meaningfully at me and without finishing her sentence . I admit that , yes , yes indeed ... , with no thought of finishing my sentence either , and head for the liquor cabinet . And in truth the whole business would be not simply , in my wife 's words , an educational experience , it would be tender and touching and sweet , if the creatures were anything less repellent to me than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually appear filthy , or monstrous , they are quite domestic in appearance , their fur does have a healthy look , a sheen . They scratch and lickthemselves frequently . Nevertheless , I lie awake listening for them to move . I hear nothing . I prop against my pillows and examine my aversion to rats , bring to memory every rat I have ever encountered . The memories are few enough and unspectacular : one monster caught in the barn by a large collie on a farm I visited as a child . But that is a good memory for the most part , and at the time I did n't really get a good.look at the rat . Another , more recently , peered out the metal door of a Dempster  --  Dunipster at the liquor store  --  momentarily frightening , no more than that . Still another rat , also in my childhood , ate fig preserves from a blue Mason jar in my grandmother 's pantry . This memory brings me straight up in bed . The rat cracked the paraffin seal of the jar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them dripping with syrup into its mouth . I turn on the light and listen for a rustling sound . Jesus , I say aloud , but hear nothing more than my own cantering auricles and ventricles and my wife 's regular breathing beside me . Daumier 's barrister above the bedroom mantel threatens to gavel out my brains , so I turn off the light again and lie awake . And in fact the gavel brings back another childhood memory . Once in an early June my father was getting the croquet equipment out of the summer house in Old Saybrook when a mouse scuttled out of the closet and across the floor . In a single wonderful motion . as though the mallet were part of his graceful arm , he swung in a wide arc and came down directly on the mouse . It splattered everywhere . But that was a mouse , I remind myself , not a rat . 1 listen again and hear nothing . I turn on the light and pick up a book . My wife turns halfway over in her sleep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of one if she should ever need it . She 'll never need it . I stay up alone all night . Saturday goes much the same . More lettuce , more cage-cleaning and stroking . When Missy is not handling them , the rats snuggle contentedly together in the top shelf area and stare at the fish . After lunch Missy takes them onto the patio and out of the cage . Settled into the hammock with her head on the pillow , she allows the rats to crawl over the letters of her An Ounce of Kif Makes You Feel Like a Camel T-shirt , which reveals her newly formed and embarrassingly untrained breasts . It is more education than I can take , except that all three of them , Missy , Dippy , and Hattie , look so contented and relaxed . The rats ' movements across her little hillocks are slow and at times comically clumsy but at the same time alert and domestic-looking . Harriet scratches be-N SUNDAY I take the call from Miss Cheshire . Missy 's teacher . She sounds drunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been thinking about this rat business all weekend , have been up nights and have looked at the problem from , so to speak , every angle , so understand that this is not something I just thought up today , so any-way , this is the thing , do n't bring those rats back to school . I do n't want them , and if Missy shows up with them I 'm going to send her back home , I 'm not going to let her in the schoolroom , so do n't try it . Well , now , wait just one minute . I say , but with no luck , since Miss Cheshire does not stop talking and does not hear me . She is through with the rats , she says , she made a mistake in ever accepting them in the first place , Missy is the only child who 's ever been allowed to bring them into her house , none of the other parents would hear of it , and listen to me , sir , she says . I have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed up , I 've had them every weekend and have lied to the pupils that other pupils were taking them home with them , so do n't bring them hack to school , I am a young woman , youngish , and have plenty of problems without rats , and you might as well know this , too , I 'm not wealthy like you , no , and never have been , I live well enough , I 'm not complaining , but it 's not much and it 's sure as hell not enough to support two rats as well as myself in this rattrap garden apartment I live in , but the money is not really the issue , it 's the rats themselves , I do n't like rats , I hate them , not that they 've ever done anything to me , in fact these two , Hattie and Dippy , are wonderful with the children , so there 's nothing personal , but no more , I ca n't have them in the room another minute longer . I think , this woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat me , that I will end up with the rats , but still I like her , I feel close to her , I suspect modern education might be improving . I tell her I do n't want them either , want nothing to do with them . I tell her the story of the fig preserves and of the splattered mouse . Over the line I hear ice clink in a glass and a deep gulp , a fit of coughing which ends in several sneezes . When Miss Cheshire comes back on the line she is even more forceful than before . Do n't bring them back , she begins with renewed vigor , flush them down the toilet , whatever you want , but I wo n't take them , and do n't try to impress me with your summerhouse croquet mallet bullshit because I 've got rat stories that will float ice cubes in your blood and which I could probably sell to Reader 's Digest for a great deal of money as true first-person accounts if I chose to do so , which I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mallet . A new thought almost staggers me with surprise : I 'm falling in love . She is from Mississippi , she says , she has spent her life getting out of Mississippi , where , she says , the first rat in the history of the world drew breath , and now she is out , not far out maybe , a Connecticut suburb is not far out but it 's out enough , and she saw plenty of rats when she was in Mississippi , she says , and she is n't going to see another one , not even to kill it , though when she accepted them into the classroom , she says , she thought , well maybe , maybe I can do it , but I ca n't , I know that now , it 's like your childhood religion , she says . You never get over it but you do n't have to stare it in the face every day , so now it 's over , you 've got the goddamn things , you keep them . Then she tells a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she says , was a tall , fat , ironic man who drank heavily , talked through his nose , and carried a loaded gun in his pants , whose given name on his birth certificate was Big Boy , named , she says , for a tomato vine which grew outside his mother 's window when he was born , which his father ( her grandfather ) chopped down with a sharpened broad-blade cotton hoe because he ( the grandfather , a short man , practically a dwarf , she says ) swore he 'd never again as long as he lived harvest tomatoes on a stepladder , and sometimes I wish , she says , he 'd chopped off my daddy 's vine , too , because when I was just a little girl , about like your own child , like Missy , she says , My daddy took me with him to a roadhouse called Upchurch 's Gas and Gro. , which had not one gallon of gas nor one loaf of bread nor anything else except some , sOrry old booths covered with checkered oilcloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he tapped me on the shoulder when we 'd been there a while and said , hun lookee hyere , just like that , and showed me directly up above us , not one ass kiss from his head , a rattail as long as a foot ruler hanging out of a crack in the ceiling boards . Whispering coarsely I astonish myself : I think I love you , I suddenly say , but she never hears me , never breaks the headlong progress of her story , talking on , the accent and rhythm and image and idiom of Mississippi slipping more and more into control of her voice , the most beautiful thing I 've ever heard , great rivers thudding against barge hulls , lynchings and banjos , sheer music . He reached up over his head , she says , and looped that rattail once around his index finger and held on , the rat squealing and squalling and running in place , scuttling and scurrying , scrambling , scratching , spinning his wheels , and going nowhere except in a circle with my tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's worth and laughing until his shoes were full and took , she says , that damn pistol out of his pants , a big nickeled .44 pistol with " Big'un " spelled out in the handlegrip in twenty-four-carat gold letters , which meant my mama 's mama had to be buried in a cardboard coffin because that 's all we could afford , and held that chunk of nickel up to the scrambling rat and blew him into so many pieces , not to mention the board ceiling of the store , that we never again saw two hunks of meat or hanks of hair bigger than the snippet of tail that broke loose and stayed in my daddy 's hand when the rest of the rat went through the roof and a trained bluetick hound out the back door so keep your goddamn rats and your fig preserve rat stories and shove them up your summer-house ass but do n't send the rats back to me , I do n't want them and I 'm not taking them . You can keep the cage free , gratis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She has hung up . We can keep the rats , I tell Missy . I 've already discussed it with your teach  --  ah , your unit leader , and it 's all right with her . My wife tells me how sort of family-oriented I 'm proving to be after all and how proud of me she is . Missy burbles to overflowing with daddydaddys . She has special collars made for them and attaches them with sterling silver tinkle bells . The Sergeant 's flea collars stay in place but seem to do no good . The rats continue to pick at their breast fur and scratch behind their ears . I ask my wife if she thinks the scratching means anything . Like what ? she wonders through Cointreau in a manner that assures me of what I already suspect , that I do n't know what I 'm talking about . Like , well , I do n't know , some disease or T HE RATS GROW to incredible size , barn rats if there ever were two , as big as house cats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic hamster cage , their fibrous ropy tails hanging to the bottom floor of the cage . Their bells do n't tinkle . They watch the fish . The fish start to die , the silver-tipped tetras . Maybe it really is the plague , I think , or the evil eye . Or maybe I 'm just going crazy . In any case , I certainly do n't seem very sensible . At first I ca n't know for certain the fish are actually dying , I can only guess . None but the five tetras seem affected . Daddy , look , Missy says , feeding them from the fish-food can . The tetras all have their mouths open , are n't they silly ? Oh , Jesus . It 's true , all five are swimming around the tank with their mouths locked open . I squat and look at them in horror . They ca n't live like that , I almost tell her , They ca n't live with their mouths locked open . But I say nothing . The fish are dying , I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she says , tetras never last long . We can get more . No , I say , I mean them . ( This comes as skeleton . The tetras are eating every morsel of food in sight , swimming to the top of the tank , diving , feeding , skimming along the surface of the water with their mouths wide open sucking in food . It is obscene . The rats pick at invisible fleas . Do n't feed the fish anymore , I tell Missy . They 're sick . But Missy feeds them more . The other fish will starve , Roy , she says . The greedy old tetras are eating just everything . Which they are , scooping up every flake into their gaping mouths , no matter how much is poured in . Missy feeds on . Then the strange movements begin . Without warning the tetras suddenly plummet to the bottom of the tank , then as rapidly flash upward and leap from the water . After skimming the surface again for a few minutes they drop again with incredible vertical speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all five of them , day and night , day in and day out for a week , scooping up gargantuan amounts of food from the surface with their locked-open mouths . I become a nervous wreck trying to watch them . call Miss Cheshire and tell her who I am . Can rats carry plague ? I say into the phone . I mean this to be a joke , but suddenly it is n't . There is no answer . I notice that I sound a little frantic . Can rats , I inquire in a bizarre parody of self-control , transmit bubonic plague to fish ? ( The idea seems ridiculous even to inc. but I fear it nonetheless . ) There is a long pause on the telephone as I wait for her answer . Finally she speaks : I really would n't know , she says , and hangs up . The tetras die , all of them . I am the only one who seems to recognize the possibility of a connection with the rats . I devote myself to a proof of the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city library , I live with the Reader 's Guide and the Encyclopaedia Britannica . At night in bed I say to my wife , I think the rats have fleas of the type that carry bubonic plague . ( The notion is extreme , as I recognize even as I say it , but I want so badly to be right about something , anything , that I can believe it . ) I 've looked it up , and I 'm pretty sure of it . I think the fish died of the plague , some form of it , I do n't know how . I hope you have n't told Missy that ! she says , startled . And because I have n't even thought of telling her I believe for an instant I am less of a fool than I am  --  that I am sensible and winning . No , I say , I have n't . I think we can just get rid of the rats quietly and that will be that . We can get another pet for her . What ! my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be the ones to handle this , I say , feeling more sensible than ever , and well-loved . And Missy should have a complete physical checkup , of course . We all should . Are you mad ? my wife says . When I said I hoped you had n't told Missy , she says , I meant I hoped you had n't jeopardized your credibility with her because I honestly believe if you can just sort of cool it with a low , and 1 mean l00000w , profile ... Look , I say , unable even to wonder that credibility and profiles had got mixed into a conversation about plague and yet pretending to be much calmer than I actually am in order to preserve whatever insane credibility I might have left , see this newspaper clipping ? There were three recorded cases of bubonic plague in Utah last year . Do you realize what that means ? I certainly do , she says , it means Utah is just as unenlightened and filthy as everyone has always known it was and has caverns full of bats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been checked by the vet . They are not gerbils , I say evenly , they are rats . I leave the bedroom . And they 've got the goddamn plague ! I shout back over my shoulder , trembling . And it 's New Mexico that has all the bats , not Utah ! A geographical victory , I think , seems better than none at all . Besides , the plague theory is becoming enormously important to defend . In my anger I dial Miss Cheshire . Miss Cheshire , I say , you are , in a primitive way , quite lovely , I suspect , certainly plainspoken in your crudely attractive way , and probably a good teacher , but despite all that , madam , you are a hick , one who  --  very like my wife , in fact  --  is self-serving in the extreme , a bully , and profoundly rude . My rats have bubonic plague , and your telephone manners are quite coarse . Goodbye . I slam the receiver . I wake up Missy . Missy honey , I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got to get rid of them right away . Oh please no , daddy , she weeps , seeming to come awake immediately , please no , get them shots for it . Get up . She pops out of bed in her blue-and-white nightie saying , Please do n't kill my friends , do n't kill Hattie and Dippy , please . Her devastating loveliness and disarming selfishness remind me of her mother when we met . I press on . Where did you say that child 's father was transferred back to ? I say , imagining a rhetorical premise : California is in the West , Utah is in the West , there is plague in Utah ... What child ? she says . The kid who gave the school the rats , where was it they lived before coming here ? I do n't remember , she says , Utah I think , or New Mexico , somewhere out West . Utah , for Christ 's sake ! I screech , forgetting my premise . It was not Utah , it was California ! Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she says . Missy , listen to me , how in God 's name can you confuse Utah and California , honey , which was it ? I do n't know , she moans , crying now . Her mother gets out of bed . What on earth ! she says , what are you doing to her ? Trying to save her from bubonic plague , I say , and teach her some geography . t Why , wonder , has elementary geography assumed such a central importance in this household ? ) Honey , I say again to Missy . Were you dreaming about Utah , did you hear me talking about Utah in your sleep ? She bawls and wo n't answer . Why do n't I shut up ? I wonder . Leave her alone ! her mother demands . Look at those goddamn rats , I demand right back , clearing my head of the Golden West and not even bothering to point out that the algae-eater is devouring one of the tetras  --  there is plenty of other evidence . Harriet Tub-man is staggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her jaw locked open and her pink tongue lolling out of her mouth . She pants for breath . Diphtheria Jean is on the top shelf doing nothing but looking at the algae-eater . Well , clearly , I say with justification , the tetras are dead as hell . I dip out the four-anda-half remaining ones from the tank in a little net and hold them as I speak , droplets of water darkening the maroon sparrow in the rug . And , I continue , can anyone deny that Harriet Tubman is seriously ill ? ( No one can . ) That she is unusually clumsy and her jaw is locked open ? ( The same . ) Animals die of a thousand things , says my wife sensibly . Is lockjaw part of the bubonic plague ? Missy says . No , not that I know of , I admit , probably not . Can fleas bite fish ? No , I say . No , of course not . Well there you are , her mother concludes , squashing me with the unspoken remainder of a syllogism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife are 64 impressed , pale and stunned by the specter of the sick rat . The four-and-a-half fish . No logic in the world , I conclude , will save that dying rat . I fling the fish aside and sleep in a guest bedroom . Harriet Tubman dies the next day with her gaping mouth rested across her right foreleg and a slab of lettuce beneath her belly . Her ? eyes are wide open as a fish 's . Missy and her mother are silenced by the death . I can scarcely feel good for seeing them so humbled . I think they might respect me . Then contagion becomes a problem . Diphtheria Jean stumbles as she comes down from the top shelf . Her breathing seems strained . Missy , I say , come look at this . She comes down the stairway holding the rosewood bannister and limping slightly . My heart leaps . I 'm afraid to mention the limp , afraid my words will intensify the disease as surely as they have conceived and already begun to spread it . The thought is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black death . Jesus . Is that possible ? What is it , Roy ? Missy asks . Look , I say at last . Look at Dippy . See how clumsy ? That 's how it starts . See how hard it is for her to walk ? Missy is haggard , puffy about the eyes . Missy , are you all right ? She seems feverish and distracted . Honey , sit over here , no here , on the couch , lie down . I want to look at you . Where is your mommy , I say , probing deeply into her groin for the telltale swelling of the lymph glands . In bed , Missy says , she does n't feel well and , daddy , I 'm so sleepy . I carry her to bed . The next day Diphtheria Jean dies . No one cares . My wife has a temperature of 102 degrees , Missy is flushed and too listless to get up . I take them to the hospital emergency room , where a doctor sees the two of them . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes higher , the doctor says , please do call me . Otherwise I see no reason for alarm , I 've treat-. ed dozens of similar cases recently . It comes on suddenly but it does n't last long , he assures me . When I mention bubonic plague and tell him about the rats and fish , he laughs . Check with the vet , he says . Or the pet shop . Plague is n't a virus anyway , he says . It 's a bacteria . It would have shown up in the white-cell count . He laughs a great deal and shakes his head . Plague , I think I hear him say , blowing his nose vigorously into a handkerchief , bubonic plague . When I ask what other patients he has treated , what schools the children are in , he ignores me . He refuses to hospitalize Missy . She 's probably coming down with the same thing as her mother , he says . It 's never as severe in children . I consider changing doctors but do not . I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down comforters . I go to the kitchen for aspirin and lemonade , thankful I 've not given them a dread disease after all . If it 's true I have n't . No argument , even between a man and a woman who are no longer in love , should end in black death . Both are already asleep when I reach their rooms with the lemonade . The phone rings . It is Miss Cheshire , speaking with an ice cube in her mouth , apologizing , as I finally understand , for her earlier manners . Take that ice cube out of your mouth so I can understand you , I say , though I am touched by her call . It is , as far as I can remember , the first time anyone has ever apologized to me . A woman anyway . Not removing the ice cube , or even apparently hearing me. she wonders if I might come over for a while this afternoon . Her apartment is on Maple , she explains , serving me the address over ice . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I decide I rather like the ice cube after all . She wants to discuss a compromise of some kind . she says . About the rats . She feels guilty , she says , for her irresponsibility in this matter . And especially , she says , about my rudeness to you . And in a delicious icewarm whisper into my earpiece tells me I am a generous and very forceful man , and please do call her Fanny . She hopes I do n't hold any of this against her , she 's been a little desperate these past weeks , she sighs , It 's a lonely lonely place . the East , for a country girl . I do n't tell her the rats are dead . Not yet . I do n't even tell her I love her , though I do again . No , I think , maybe I do n't . No , of course I do n't . Not exactly . I hang up and wonder whether I should take a little gift , a peace offering , some type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm . I knot a fresh tie and stand at the hail mirror to catch the three-quarter frontal pose . One hand on a hip , the other hooked carelessly by the thumb in my jacket pocket . Not exactly what I 'd hoped : a parody of the Jack Nicklaus men 's casuals advertisement . A little ridiculous , but not bad . Not at all . In fact I look pretty damn good . I unbutton the jacket and quick-flash the red lining at the mirror . Or maybe she would like an amusing little wine , I think . Perhaps a single flower . ?
