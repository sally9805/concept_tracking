FOUR ARGUMENTS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF TELEVISION by Jerry Mcmder Morrow ; 371 pages ; $11.95 hardcover , $4.95 paperback <P> Pipe arguments are the equivalent of pipe dreams . The farther they wander from probabilities , the more fun and fury they produce . Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear were experts at such arguments : Is too much energy being wasted transporting ham and bacon from farm to dinner table ? How pleasurable to insist that pigs must fly . Author Jerry Mander 's treatise offers precisely this kind of joyous irresponsibility . The world knows that the megabucks technology of television is not , repeat not , going to be eliminated . On his final page , Mander himself acknowledges that he has no idea how to get rid of the box . But until that terminus he offers the intriguing notion of a society without aerials , reruns or Howard Cosell . <P> Mander begins well . People who bother to read books at all are usually not proud of the hours they spend staring straight ahead ; a book about destroying the tube can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former advertising and public relations agent who grew disenchanted with his meal ticket in the late 1960s , exhorts with all the zeal of the convert and enthusiasm of the initiate . He rattles on like a college freshman who has just been alerted to the difference between illusion and reality . In fact , Mander argues that TV created this difference : " Unlike ordinary life , in which whatever you see actually exists outside you before you let it in through your eyes , a television image gains its existence only once you 've put it together inside your head . " <P> Throughout , the author displays a certainty about what is concrete in ' ' ordinary life " that would have baffled 2,000 years ' worth of philosophers . All of his arguments hang on the Tinkertoy division between what is real and good ( trees , marshes , noble savages ) and what is deceitful ( all artifacts of civilization , especially TV ) . From this it follows that television 1 ) obscures the true and the beautiful , 2 ) turns people into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foreign images and 4 ) blots out all messages that are inimical to its own survival . <P> Much of this may be true . McLuhan covered some of the same terrain and saw it was good . Mander hollers that it is horrible . But he punches so wildly that he arouses sympathy for The Gong Show . No source is too doubtful or irrelevant to cite , provided it can somehow be mobilized into an attack on the target . " It is known , " Mander states ominously , " that light affects the testicular growth of sparrows . " The author writes with such urgency that simple distinctions get trampled : " As you may have noticed , a lot of people seem to be going crazy these days . People are shooting each other as never before , walking the streets with blank stares , lying in doorways , making jail a way of life , or living off welfare . "
