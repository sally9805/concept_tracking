PASSION PLAY by Jerzy Kosinski ; St. Martin 's Press ; 271 pages ; $10.95 <P> Jerzy Kosinski 's heroes have become dependable literary fixtures , as recognizable as Kafka 's K. or Beckett 's tramps . Rootless , quixotic , warped by an anti-childhood in Holocaust Europe , they traverse the American landscape like knights-errant on a futile search for purpose . <P> In Passion Play , Kosinski 's seventh novel , the man 's name is Fabian . But in essence he is the bloodless Levanter of Blind Date ( 1977 ) , the vengeful wanderer Tarden of Cockpit ( 1975 ) and the haunted boy in Kosinski 's first and best fiction , The Painted Bird . Fabian differs from his predecessors chiefly in occupation : he is a competitive horseman . The aging jockey plays a strange sort of polo - a one-on-one contest in which animal and rider become a single figure jousting on a timeless range . Like many equestrians , Kosinski 's rider is graceful on horseback ; dismounted from his horse , Big Lick , he becomes one more high-plains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not hard to find . In the Midwest or the desert , in banana republics or along the Florida gold coast , Fabian 's mobile VanHome is seldom without its lady for the evening . Adolescents , sophisticates , even transsexuals are all given equal time . Yet the warning sign on Fabian 's van says more about its owner than about the alarm system : SELF-REACTOR : AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY . In this picaresque , passion is reserved for the playing field . Despite his experiments with sex and drugs , Fabian truly gets high on Fabian . With characteristic insouciance , the author describes his hero 's liaisons : " He found himself selecting , isolating , soliciting partners as transient and avid as himself , as ready to initiate , as willing to discard . " <P> This centerfold prose disfigures the novel and makes a few paragraphs indistinguishable from Harold Robbins at the gallop : " When she arrived , the flare of her seductive allure would be in full glow , the meld of her sexuality fired by the challenge of another woman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passion Play . The reader who can get past horse-and-lady scenes that bear no relation to International Velvet will be rewarded with passages of great force . <P> The author has been around the track in every sense ; he knows the sound and aroma of mornings when the woods seem to renew themselves as the rider watches ; his descriptions of equestrian combat belong on the same shelf with Hemingway and Tolstoy . His accounts of a South American republic where the main sources of power are the ox and the jet are masterpieces of irony and pure narrative . He tirelessly examines what he terms " the regency of pain . " Like Dostoyevsky 's , Kosinski 's characters explore their own souls , always reaching for limits . Fabian even visits hospitals where he knows no patient , forcing himself to meet the in curable , to witness the most vulnerable lives . The results are never less than compelling , but they are never more than set pieces .                   @ @
