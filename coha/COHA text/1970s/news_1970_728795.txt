txt Prom the Mail Box pg . 147 From the Mail Box Only Eight Lines ? To the Editor : Was the eight-line verse about Tinker to Evers to ' Chance all F.P.A. wrote ? ( Letters to the sports editor , Aug. 9 . ) There 's at least one more : Why go to the game when the Cubs are in town ? You can tell the result at a glance ! They won in the ninth on a quick double play , Tinker to Evers to Chance . Perhaps it was the work of an amateur verse maker . I remember my father reciting it when I was very , very ' young . CHARLES A. KING Middletown , N.Y . About Horseshoe Pitching To the Editor : Permit me the expression of some feeling for what I am sure you regard as a very esoteric sport , that of horseshoe pitching . The fact is that The Times prides itself in covering news of such sports as chess , curling , bowls , yachting or pistol shooting . But when it comes to horseshoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The world horseshoe tournament has been concluded at South Gate ; Calif. , after five days of intensive competition among the top professionals . The game has risen to the point that there is now nearly $8,000 in prize money for this tournament and attendance reaches between 3,000 and 4,000 spectat ors each day . The excitement rises each day until the suddendeath playoffs of the final day . The iron-nerve accuracy in making , ringers at the 40-foot distance is incredible , the top 10 throwing between 80 per cent and 85 per cent ringers over the five-day endurance stretch . Millions of Americans play horseshoes , backyard or picnic , while more than 25,000 belong to organized clubs or leagues . There are hundreds organized in New York , Westchester , Long Island and New Jersey for match and tournament play . Next year the world tournament . will he staged on beautiful courts at Middlesex , N.J. In preparation for next year at Middlesex , I want to he assured . of decent coverage . Please do not conclude that this is merely a barnyard pastime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play the game , the 1969 champion being 21 years of age . It is perhaps the best competitive exercise , at the lowest cost , that there is for middle-aged heart muscles . DR . CARL VON DER LANCKEN White Plains , N.Y . About Joe Namath To the Editor : I am not a football fan and do not follow the game . However , the exploits and the glory of the Jets could hardly escape the notice of anyone who reads his newspaper or lends an ear to his radio . Some people grow with the coming of success ? others merely swell . I have in mind Namath . Perhaps Namath owes nothng to his fellow players ( although this could be debated ) , but what about his indebtedness to the game of football ? The lofty spot in which he now inds himself is directly attributable to the game of football , submerged as he is in the aduation of the sporting world ? yet he turns a shabby shoulder oward it with only a thought of self as his motivation . Nobody quarrels with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he may properly do this and also play football if this is possible , but to turn away from all obligations to his fellow players , his team and the game of football itself and then demand that management grant him a " big oan " as the price for his condescending to play ( " I do n't want to play football " ) seems unconscionable , especially when these demands are made in order that he may operate or pursue careers in acting , employment agencies , night clubs , restaurants , ad nauseam . Is there not a decent limit that would expect first of all that football players play football ? Al Atkinson , his co-player , summed it all up very cogently a few days ago . Perhaps nothng beyond that need be said . DAVID H. BROWN New York , N.Y .  - -   - -  - The Umpire 's Call To the Editor : In his write-up of Rod Laver 's loss to Tony Roche , Neil Amdur is much too kind toward Umpire Jim Sullivan ; perhaps tactful is a better word . Simply put , Sullivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught that when a ball lands near a corner , he checks both the baseline and the sideline linesman . Sullivan might be excused for missing Linesman Whittier 's call in the crowd noise ; it is inexcusable to miss an arm signal as well . Sullivan just as conveniently overlooked the 10-minute limit on rest period and the occasional delays in changing courts . GERALD W. MANHOLD Member , E.L.T.U.A. Madison , N.J. ? ? It Was on TV , Too To the Editor : In the baseball roundup of Aug. 12 there was an erroneous statement . Philadelphia Phillies ' fans may have listened to the game on radio , but they were also able to watch the entire game , live and in color , on WFIL-TV in Philadelphia ; WLYH in Lebanon , Pa. , and WNEP-TV in Scranton , Pa . Atlantic Richfield Company is the rights owner for all radio and television coverage of the Phillies , and has sponsored these broadcasts for over 30 years . The game was on WCAU radio , but it was also televised . J. GORDON BRIDGE Hughes Sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
