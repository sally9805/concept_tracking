&gt; When 1975 was rung in last week at Britain 's old Royal Greenwich Observatory , which is located on the meridian where the earth 's time zones begin , it arrived precisely one second late . For official timekeepers everywhere , including the National Bureau of Standards in the U.S. , the delay was significant . The earth 's rotation ( which forms the basis of time units-hours , minutes , seconds ) is gradually slowing down-largely because of tidal friction . For that reason , the timekeepers decided a few years ago to make an occasional correction by inserting a so-called leap second . In that way , the accurate atomic clocks that they rely on to keep the exact time do not get ahead of the less dependable earth . Since leap seconds were introduced in 1972 , four have been added , and even more can be expected in the future as the earth continues its gradual slowdown . <P> &gt; Since last fall , many parts of the world have reported unusually spectacular sunsets that have turned the sky into brilliant displays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at NASA 'S Langley Research Center think that they have found the cause of the heavenly pyrotechnics . Writing in Applied Optics , Physicists Michael McCormick and William Fuller Jr . report that their surveys of the stratosphere with laser beams have revealed two new layers of dust at altitudes of 10 and 12.5 miles . That extra dust would enhance a well-known phenomenon : when the sun is low in the sky , its rays travel through more of the atmosphere and thus encounter more dust particles . The particles , in turn , tend to scatter the blue ( or shorter ) wave lengths of the spectrum more than the red , thereby causing the sky to redden at sunset or sunrise . McCormick and Fuller say that the probable source of the new dust is the frequently erupting Volcan de Fuego in Guatemala . <P> &gt; Women in the sciences have long complained justifiably of a " skirt differential . " That is , they have been paid less than men even when they have held comparable jobs . Now that differential may be changing in the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemical Society found that newly graduated women chemists and chemical engineers are being paid on average 5% more than male graduates . A decade ago , women entering chemistry were earning only 86% as much as their male counterparts . The society says that the turnabout is probably the result of more intensive bidding by employers for women chemists to make up for " years of unequal employment practices . "
