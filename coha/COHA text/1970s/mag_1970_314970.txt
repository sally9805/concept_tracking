Terror in the Streets <P> Sir : Your cover story on urban terrorism Nov. 2 was a welcome analysis of a subject that has thrust its ugly head to the fore . Perhaps it will serve to open the eyes and the minds of all those who scream for law and justice in one place while openly applauding terrorism and lawlessness in another , and of those who fear a creeping octopus of crime in their own backyard , yet applaud Communist-supported and fascist-like anarchy and murder in others . <P> Truly , we 're all in it together . <P> MATTHEW MAIBAUM Los Angeles <P> Sir : You quoted several remarks of mine concerning " the new terror " in the U.S. You did not , however , quote my diagnosis of the phenomenon : that it is the result of the political system 's inability to reform itself from within . I would like your readers to know that , in my view , this violence will continue until America makes the choice between a radical social transformation and neofascist repression . Terrorism is symptomatic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate state to solve the people 's problems . Until the corporate state becomes a people 's state there will be no peace in America . <P> RICHARD E. RUBENSTEIN Roosevelt University Chicago <P> Sir : In the ' teens they prized autos that could chug along at barely one-mile-an-hour so they could flirt with walking girls . In the ' 20s they flaunted hip flasks , wore raccoon coats , necked in rumble seats , and said , " excuse my dust . " In the ' 30s they sat on flagpoles , danced marathons , leaned on WPA shovels and attended Pink meetings . In the ' 40s they ate live goldfish and carried books to avoid carrying rifles . In the ' 50s they staged panty raids , crowded 18 into five-passenger cars , burned rubber and played chicken . In the ' 60s they let their hair grow , smoked pot , read poetry in the rain , went nude . In the ' 70s , to top their forebears and get attention , they could only throw bombs . <P> GRADY JOHNSON Santa Eulalia , Ibiza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you missed the point of Charles Reich 's The Greening of America Nov. 2 and misinterpreted much of what he says . It is true that some of his writing reeks with " incense , " and some of the points he chooses to dwell upon are all too obvious . Unfortunately they are obvious only to some of us . Professor Reich has managed to put many things in proper perspective for those of us who feel that our objectives have all too often been empty or off the track , and who can not feel that achieving these objectives has been rewarding in any true sense of the word . <P> MRS . ROBERT LONGMAN Woodbury , N.Y . <P> Sir : Mr. Reich could have saved me much confusion if he had written Greening sooner . Consciousness III is not easy for one of my age ( 41 ) to get to , but well worth the effort . Consciousness IIIs smile a lot , hold doors , say hello , do n't get frantic , and have an inner love and sense of humor that is delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously your reviewer has not reached this state . <P> ( MRS . ) JEAN C.
