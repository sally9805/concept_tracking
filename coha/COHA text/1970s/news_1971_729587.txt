txt President Nixon told a press conference here that " we are making very significant progress " with Soviet Russia on the Berlin talks , " good progress " on the so-called SALT talks over control of nuclear weapons ; and that discussions are proceeding hopefully over the Middle East . Mr. Nixon does not intend to go to Moscow en route to Peking , but divulged that he has discussed a possible summit talk with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko and they had decided that no purpose would be served unless current dis- cussions through regular diplomatic channels required direct conferences . Mr. Nixon cautioned against the hope that his China visit will lead of " instant d ? tente " but said that it has already moved relationships from " confrontation without commu- nication " to an " era of negotiation and discussion .

He agreed that the SALT talks are " very technical and sticky " in their specific details but spoke of progress made so far Viet Cong peace proposal ?

Casualties are down for South Vietnamese too As to the election in South Vietnam , the U S. wants a fair election and will remain neutral . Pakistan Mr. Nixon volunteered at the start of the press conference that he opposes cutting off aid to West Pakistan as proposed by the Senate because it would destroy U S influence and would not aid the refugees from East Pakistan who are fleeing into India The U.S. has allocated $70 million to the refugees to date ( more than all the rest of the world together ) and is trying to avert famine by allocating 360,000 tons of grain and $3 million to charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with economic problems Here are some of the subjects covered ? Differences with Arthur F. Burns The President used the conference to play down reports from underofficials of the White House that he was irked at the man whom he named to be head of the Federal Reserve System . These reports were put out to press associations on what appeared to be excellent White House authority and had reached a point where they could be denied only by Mr Nixon personally , which he proceeded to do . He did not deny that differences existed , but he spoke highly of Mr Burns personally and tried to stress the points of agreement Mr Burns has advocated a wage-price review board to attempt to curb inflation . Wage-price controls : Mr Nixon moved to head off a serious revolt within his own party where a dozen Senate Republicans want him to propose a system of wage-price restraints As Mr Nixon spoke , Secretary of the Treasury John B Connally Jr , the administration 's designated voice on economic affairs , was saying he welcomed a full-fledged debate in Congress on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not specifically reject a more aggressive administration attitude But , he argued ( 1 ) the economy is improving in any event , ( 2 ) prices and wages are coming under control ; ( 3 ) short of compulsion , voluntary pressure does n't work .

Mr. Nixon softened previous adamant opposition to a Burns-type wage-price review board and said he would consider it if hear- , ings in Congress convinced him it could be done " without stifling the economy " However , he loaded reporters with reasons for not trying it .
