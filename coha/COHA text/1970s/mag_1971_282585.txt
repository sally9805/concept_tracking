The Royal Shakespeare Company 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream is a dazzling delight from beginning to end and a frolicsome homage to the Bard at which he himself might approvingly twinkle . Acclaimed on its opening in Stratford ( TIME , Oct. 19 ) , the production has crossed the Atlantic undiminished in verve and excellence . <P> The show 's director , Peter Brook , is a man of many devices . His chief device is to defeat the traditional expectations of the audience . His credo might be " Accentuate the opposite . " This credo links Marat/ Sade with King Lear and A Midsummer Night 's Dream . Do we expect actors to move naturally on stage and to speak intelligible words ? In Marat/ Sade , Brook made his actors move as if walking were a stylized , agonized abstraction of motion . The actors moaned , groaned , hissed and made surrealistic animal noises . Do we think of Lear as an arrogant red-hotheaded old king , his own Fool 's fool ? Brook gave us the first ice-cold Lear , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a puppet meaninglessly strung from a sky without gods . <P> In A Midsummer Night 's Dream , the Brook tactic is amplified . As experienced , the world of a dream is nocturnal and ill-defined . Brook sets his Dream within three sharp , blazingly white gym walls . For trees , Brook gives us heavy metal coils . Bucolic imagery becomes relentlessly urban . <P> Too Many Tricks ? This is not to say that Brook has violated Shakespeare . However , the incessant sportive business of the production-stilt-walking , juggling , confetti and paper-olate throwing - makes one wonder a little about the Brook who has said that in today 's theater " we must open our empty hands and show that really there is nothing up our sleeves . " Is he not now committed to wearing a few too many tricks on his sleeve ? <P> A Midsummer Night 's Dream raises one further question . Both Peter Brook and Jerzy Grotowski. the astringently rigorous Polish director to whom Brook is partially indebted , have repeatedly claimed that they want to restore the theater to actors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironically proved the opposite . Actors under Brook and Grotowski express Brook and Grotowski , rather in the manner of orchestras under the batons of Toscanini or Koussevitzky . Their group efforts are mesmerically disciplined , but their individuality seems submerged . <P> Perhaps Brook and Grotowski are caretakers of survival for an era in which drama is in abeyance or decline . Their productions are brilliant rockets that momentarily light up a dark creative sky that awaits the suns and moons of great and gifted playwrights.
