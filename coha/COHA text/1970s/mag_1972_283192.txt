Exactly ten months after China 's admission to the United Nations , the Peking delegation last week wielded its first veto as a permanent member of the Security Council . The issue was particularly embarrassing for a country that had itself been excluded for 22 years-the admission of Bangladesh . <P> Formerly the eastern half of Pakistan , Bangladesh broke away in the short bloody war last December , during which China supported Pakistan , while India backed the rebels . Since then the new country has clearly earned entre to the U.N. ; 85 nations already recognize it . But China , speaking for Pakistan , strenuously opposed Bangladesh 's admission while more than 90,000 civilian and military prisoners were still in Indian hands , contrary to U.N . resolutions . China felt compelled to support its ally in order to maintain a toehold on the Indian subcontinent . <P> That awkward situation provided an opportunity for the Soviet Union to embarrass Peking . Moscow hoped to demonstrate that China , contrary to disclaimers , is a superpower , and that in no sense does she champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Council vote on admission , eleven of the 15 members of the Security Council , including the U.S. , Russia and India , voted to recommend membership , three abstained , and only China voted to oppose the entry of Bangladesh . Now , unless the Pakistanis themselves recognize Bangladesh soon , the Chinese may find themselves further embarrassed by the reintroduction of the issue as a topic of debate in the forthcoming General Assembly .
