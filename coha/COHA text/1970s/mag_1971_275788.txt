Covering the Mob , " claims TIME 'S New York-based Correspondent Sandy Smith , " is as safe as covering a Sunday-school picnic . " The principal reporter for this week 's cover story on " The Mafia at War , " towering , jovial Smith has exposed much of organized crime 's invisible empire , and in the process has become one of the best-known crime reporters in the nation . <P> Smith has made the Mafia his beat since the early 1950s , when he covered Chicago 's underworld as a pavement-pounding police reporter , first for the Chicago Tribune and then the Chicago Sun-Times .
