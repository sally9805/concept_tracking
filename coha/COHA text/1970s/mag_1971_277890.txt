However conservative he may be in matters of traditional doctrine and discipline , Pope Paul VI has always had a warm predilection for social activism . As Archbishop Giovanni Battista Montini of Milan , he initiated a range of programs for the workers and poor of that problem-plagued archdiocese . In his travels as Pope , he has repeatedly made a point of seeking out the sick and impoverished . His remarkable 1967 social encyclical , Populorum Progressio ( On the Development of Peoples ) , called on nations to engage in a worldwide program of aggressive social action . Now comes an apostolic letter* in which the Pope addresses his appeal for social reform to the individual Christian , describing personal involvement as a duty . <P> In acting , the Pope warned , Catholics should eschew both the " dangerous and illusory " appeal of Marxism , as irreconcilable with a Christian concept of man , and the lure of unrestrained liberalism , which exalts the individual beyond social obligations .

Though he named no names or specific deeds-except for a favorable reference to worker priests-a source close to him gave some examples of what the Pope had in mind , and they are likely to inflame the existing debate over activism in the church . <P> The Vatican aide cited approvingly both the U.S. activities of the Berrigan brothers ( provided they did not resort to violent methods ) and the widespread campaign to improve living conditions for migrant workers . He also pointed to the dedication of Archbishop Helder Pessoa Camara of Recife to Brazil 's poor , and the work of Peruvian Bishop Luis Barbarn , " the slum bishop , " who devotes his time to the slum dwellers around Lima .

Grinding urbanization is among the Pope 's prime targets . The " inordinate growth " of cities has left men with " a new loneliness in an anonymous crowd . <P> Instead of favoring fraternal encounter and mutual aid , the city fosters discrimination and indifference . It is the weakest who are victims of dehumanizing living conditions . " Cities create a " new proletariat " of the aged , the maladjusted , the handicapped and others on the fringes of society . <P> Conspicuous consumption is another target . " While very large areas of the population are unable to satisfy their primary needs , superfluous needs are ingeniously created . Is man not now becoming the slave of the objects he makes ? " Paul also scores the " ill-considered exploitation of nature " that may create " an environment for tomorrow which may well be intolerable .
