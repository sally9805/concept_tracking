 | VOICES FROM THE SILENT MAJORITY Nixon 's elusive constituency speaks up . @# And so ? to you , the great silent majority of my fellow Americans ? I ask for your support . Let us be united for peace . Let us also be united against defeat . Because let us understand : North Vietnam can not defeat or humiliate the United States . Only Americans can do that . ? President Nixon to the nation , Nov. 3 , 1969 We were riding through downtown Aurora , Illinois , in William G. Mitchler The Real Estate Man 's brand-new Cadillac automobile . " Damn it . Mitchler , " said Bobby Moga The Township Supervisor , " if you ever get into politics you 're going to have to sell this thing . Who 'd vote for a man who rides around in a car this big ? " " I earned this car , " replied William G. Mitchler , whose shoulders filled about half the front seat . " Give me a choice between the office and the car , and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewise in the seat to talk to me , the visiting journalist , in Aurora in quest of Mr. Nixon 's Silent Majoritarians . Over the phone a few nights earlier I had explained to Moga that I had obtained , from Herb Klein 's office in the White House , a sampling of letters written to the President after the November 3 speech , that I intended to do an article on some of the persons who wrote them , and that I would like to visit with him . The attention pleased Moga , a stocky fellow of thirty-seven with thinning hair , a firm grip , and a metal American flag in his lapel . " You mean that Mr. Nixon The President actually sat down and read my letter ? " he asked when I arrived in his office . That I did not know , I said , only that the White House bureaucracy , upon request , disgorged his letter as " representative " of the 400,000-odd received the week following the address . " Think of that , " Bobby Moga said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now we were driving through Aurora , and talking about its attitude toward the war . Aurora is forty miles and two counties due west of Chicago , originally farming , now light industrial ; population ( Chamber of Commerce estimate ) 100,000 : but still far enough from The City to avoid what Moga called " the kooky stuff . " " Most patriotic place in the whole country , " Bobby Moga said . He pointed to a hardware store that rambled most the length of a city block . " Fellow there , on patriotic occasions , he furnishes flags for this entire section of the street . Good people here , none of that mess you have in Chicago or New York . " This is a cute little incident that happened during the Moratorium . We have some of those damned people here , even in a decent town like Aurora . Some get out here from Chicago , some of them are homegrown , those damned hippies . But nobody pays much attention to them . " Anyway , this guy with greasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I get mad just looking at them ? anyway , he came into the township building and he started setting up a card table and some signs . " I got red . God but I got mad . I walked over to him and I did n't even read his sign . I knew what the hell he was all about . I said to him , . What 's your problem , pal ? What 's with you , pal ? I kept calling him pal every second breath , that 's the way to keep those bastards off balance . " I said to him , You ai n't setting up nothin ' like that in here , pal , let 's get movin ' , pal . " Oh , hell yes , he started protesting , he was saying Nazi Germany and civil rights and freedom of speech and how I was no better than a German storm trooper , and I started getting madder . " I reached out and grabbed him under my left arm ? got a good hold on him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat and gripped himself under the arm to demonstrate his hold ? " and I was holding him real tight , and he was hollering . And with my other arm ? my right one , I 'm right-handed , too , you know ? I picked up his lousy stinking card table and his goddamned sign and I pulled the whole mess right through the door and pitched his ass out on Water Street . Do n't bring that sort of crap into this building , pal , and do n't make me mad , I told him . That 's the only way to handle jerks like thathustle 'm right on outside . I 'm not letting any goddamned hippie jerk of a demonstrator use my office for that sort of thing . "  | Sandusky , Ohio , in early December is a place of raw , cheek-chilling cold , where gulls peck stupidly at the ice of Lake Erie , two blocks north of downtown , wondering what happened to the water ; and even the locals hurry when out of doors . Economically , Sandusky is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each of the Big Three , foundries , and metals-fabricating plants . Geographically , Sandusky just misses the beaten path ? too far north of the Ohio Turnpike to attract motorists without specific business there : too far west of Cleveland ( 126 miles ) for a comfortable one-day trip ; lacking even that most esteemed merit badge of contemporary boosterism , scheduled commercial airline service . Jean Gast , a pleasant , fortyish housewife and mother of four , has lived in Sandusky all her life , and the last twenty-three years , those of her marriage , in the same house her Irishdescended family occupied when she was a child . She is n't exactly bored , for she has her children , her bowling ( trophies dominate a shelf at one end of the living room ) , her sewing ( she is good enough to have a faithful clientele for her dresses ) , and her church work ? but Jean Gast does recognize that her town is n't the intellectual center of the Western world . " Sandusky is a stick-in-the-mud community , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no tendency for people to take off and live elsewhere . You tend to associate with your highschool friends ; the same people you grew up with you see the rest of your life . People may move out into the housing developments outside of town , but most stay right here . " But Jean Gast tries . Last year she did volunteer work at a neighborhood opportunities center , financed by OEO , attempting to bring a fifth-grade child up from third-grade reading level . After several months of tutoring he improved dramatically . " He began to do extra reading . You know , some of these children had never been to a public library . Lynn was so proud when he did well on his tests . " But because of budget cuts the center closed , and Jean Gast is more than a little miffed with the Nixon Administration . Jean Gast paid little attention to the war until her eldest son became a senior in high school . " I really became concerned about it then , when it began to get close to home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she gleans from casual reading of daily newspapers and newsmagazines . " Lot of it I do n't feel we will ever understand ? I think we more or less drifted into it . But we made a pact with them the South Vietnamese ; when you do that , make a pact , you should honor it . " Pause . " I do n't feel we have enough information to know whether policies are right or not . Leave it to the leader . " Bob Gast , a heavy-bellied man in a work jacket , works at a General Motors plant . He drifted in to join our conversation . Does he hear much discussion of the war at work or among friends ? " I 'm afraid not . We have a pretty well-established group at the plant , men who 've been there , and in the 68 union , for twenty years or more . They 're comfortable , very little bothers them . " Mrs. Gast listened to the President 's speech in her living room ? alone , because Bob Gast was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her portable typewriter and wrote Mr. Nixon a letter which said , in part : We did not vote for you in the last election , but now I wish there would be a place on the ballot to give you a vote of confidence , so that you would know we are 100% behind you .... We have quite a stake in your peace plan as we have two boys in the service now . One is stationed in this country and the other is flying supplies into Da Nang . Also , we have a sixteenyear-old boy who is rapidly approaching draft age .... Stick to your guns and stand firm , not only with the enemy , but also with the dissenters and troublemakers who give aid and comfort to the enemy by tearing us apart from within . If only the quiet ones would raise their voices , they would drown out the protesters and let the Communists know we are still a united people . Jean Gast mailed the letter at the corner at midnight while going to pick up her husband at the factory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that night I felt he had the odds against him , and he needed someone to say they were with him . I really felt sorry for him , struggling against large odds and betting on the come . " Bobby Moga was especially pleased that I had come to Aurora on December 8 , a Monday . " The combined service clubs are having a luncheon over at the YMCA today commemorating the Jap attack on Pearl Harbor . Let 's go over there ? it will give you an idea of what a helluva town this is. and how we get together behind the right ideas. - " Soon I found myself standing in line with several score Aurorans on a basketball court , awaiting a paper plate of fried chicken and stuffed cabbage . Bobby Moga 's brother , John , shook my hand and gave me a red plastic comb embossed : MAKE JOHNNY MOGA THE PLUMBER YOUR PLUMBER . Moga tugged at my arm . " Come on . We 're putting you at the head table . " I insisted I 'd just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to a Marine major general . " Let 's make sure I got your name right from Moga , " said the toastmaster . He handed me a slip of paper on which was printed : MR . GOLDEN , REPRESENTING THE WHITE HOUSE My first horrified impulse was to snatch away the paper and swallow it . Posing as Captain Joe Golden . head of the Philadelphia Police Department 's homicide squad , and as Joe Dealey , publisher of the Dallas News , are stunts I have performed under the impulsiveness of reportorial license , each time capitalizing upon someone 's misintroduction . But as an agent of the Nixon Administration ? " God no. ? I said . " I 'm just a writer , here to do a story . " " But  | Moga said Herb Klein sent you . " " No , no , I got Moga 's letter from Klein 's office . I do n't work for Klein . " This intelligence disappointed the man , and I thought for a moment I would be sent to the kitchen to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to four hundred assembled Aurorans : " And also with us-at the head table today is Mr. Gordon from Herb Klein 's office in the White House . " I said something sotto voce that brought an alarmed . =lance from the Marine general , and I continued eating my fried chicken . The luncheon was the idea of Dr. Stanley Parks , a dentist who is president of the Aurora Navy League , a quasi-official organization which lobbies for bigger Navy appropriations and warns the public against the Soviet naval menace . Parks said he had been questioned " as to why we would want to remember this day ; are we trying to open up old wounds ? " Something more was involved than honoring the 2,400 Americans who died at Pearl Harbor : " We remember that Americans reacted to the shocking attack with a unity that has never been expressed in the history of our country .... Americans were n't ashamed to profess their loyalty and their patriotism .... Yes , patriotism stood at a high ebb . " Now , Parks lamented , " loyalty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is really something cool ' to criticize and protest . The Constitutional right of dissent has degenerated to an excuse to undermine . From the Senate floor , the college campus , sensationalist picture magazines , and other such media , sanctimonious hypocrites would castigate the men who loyally serve our country .... " Rising applause . ( " Damnit , let 's make sure Senator Percy gets a copy of Doe 's speech , " I heard a man say later . " Or better yet , let 's send Doc to Washington and bring Percy home for a rest . " ) Nine Pearl Harbor survivors from Aurora and the vicinity sat at round tables-of-honor with their o , ivies ? self-consciously excited about an event almost three decades distant , now revived to bring them unaccustomed attention . Police Captain Alex Puscas spoke for them . How sad it was , Puscas said , to hear taps sounded over soldiers ' graves . " Will taps ever be sounded for the last time ? Will America ever die ? Not so long as its people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl Harbor ! " A local music teacher closed the proceedings with " The Battle Hymn of the Republic , " truly a song for all seasons ? Andy Williams sang it , agonizingly low and slow , the sad June morning when Bobby Kennedy 's body was borne from the heavy gloom of St. Patrick 's Cathedral ; the Republicans sang it in Miami Beach two months later , then nominated Richard Nixon for the Presidency ; now the Silent Majoritarians sang it in anthem rhythm , finding in Mr. Lincoln 's song a soulful bond to the American tradition : quasi-religious verses that bring tears to the eyes and send them back to their insurance offices and grain stores and drug counters with the satisfied feeling one gets from a good Methodist sermon or a close football victory . " These are real people , " Bobby Moga said as we left the YMCA . " Did you ever see anything like this have enough in Washington ?

It is devoid of Automobia 's chrome and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighborhood ( General Motors ' headquarters are across the street ) where Roosevelt-era styling is acceptable . My host looked vaguely like Johnny Carson ? nervous smile , neat short haircut , an open sincere face , eager eyes that keep right on you . He wants you to like him , he does , and he wants to like you . But he was restrained the first few minutes of our conversation ; something bothered him , and we could n't get beyond pleasantries . He finally said , " Do you intend to identify me by name ? " I said I hoped so .. that one purpose of my article was to give flesh-and-blood identity to the Silent Majoritarians . This disturbed my host . " I live in Birmingham . Michigan . Birmingham has the reputation of . . . well , being an all-white community , that sort of thing . I 'm afraid I might be labeled a racist , you know what I mean ? I do n't want to be the target of crank mail . " He would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquiesced , my host ? let 's call him Morrow , although that is not his name ? relaxed . " Because the world is divided into power blocs , and always has been so , war is going to be with us until man 's nature changes . I recall my father saying to me , Your war will come . ' Well , this was in the Thirties , and I said the same thing to my sons in the Fifties . Sure enough , their war did come . " My oldest is a helicopter pilot , a big handsome guy six-five and more than two hundred pounds . His attitude is absolutely beautiful ; the tapes we get from Vietnam would tear you up , the pride he takes in doing his job . Now my brother is n't so lucky .

I think a lot of Smoot . He has good insight into what 's going on in the country ? he 's an ex-FBI agent , you know . " No , I do n't have time for books , but I do get to some . For instance , Eddie Rickenbacker 's Incredible Victory sic , about Midway . That 's what I 'm doing now . On Vietnam ? No , ca n't say that I have . Are there any hooks on Vietnam ? Bernard Fall ?

TV news is too much nonsense and not enough empirical fact . " I kind of agree with Agnew on news control . As an experiment once , a friend and I sat down with a Michigan newspaper and marked out all the syndicated news on the front page . Why , there was n't anything left . That shows you the news is controlled by a few people . There 's something else I 'll tell you . We found a situation in a chain of Michigan newspapers ? I 'm not going to give you their name ? where a word was being deleted from these syndicated stories , or a line transposed . so that the entire meaning was changed . The net result was to disseminate a distinctively Communist line . Well , we took care of it . We found out who was responsible , and we took care of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's not get into that . But the doctoring of news stopped . All I wanted to point out is that there are people who will distort the news for ulterior motives . " Morrow did n't give a thought to voting for Hubert Humphrey because he detests union " featherbedding and inflation " ( asserting labor wrecked a small company he once owned ) . " I was fifty-fifty- when the campaign started . between Our Friend George and Nixon . I turned to Nixon . who had always been pretty straight . Beside , I was afraid Wallace might turn fascist .... " Morrow was traveling the night of Nixon 's speech , and he wrote his letter on Holiday Inn stationery from Erie . Pennsylvania : Your speech tonight reaffirms my faith in you as our President . I agree one hundred percent with your position .... It is my opinion also that there would be a bloodbath of all opponents to Communism in South Vietnam if we should pull out of that country overnight . 11Iy son is there and tells us by letters and tapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I are , of course , concerned about his safety , but we both agree that we have a commitment to the future that our son is there to protect . On Moratorium weekend Morrow visited his youngest son 's fraternity at Michigan State University .

But do you know , fifteen of the kids were missing . 1 asked where they were . and found they had gone to Washington to demonstrate . Can you imagine such a thing ? to go off and march when we had such a nice program at Lansing for them ? " @# I think the time has come . " said Major General Francis S.

" I am a member of the Ohio National Guard .... At our monthly Guard meeting this past weekend we were each given a copy of a letter in support of President Nixon 's policy on the Vietnam war . We were requested to sign the letters and give them to the commander or mail them personally to the President .... Although the signing was supposedly voluntary , a report was to be made as to the number of men who participated . ? Constituent 's letter to Senator Stephen Young ( Democrat , Ohio i Robert R. Moga is classifiable as a Silent Majoritarian solely because until November 1969 he had never undertaken to tell a President of the United States what he thought about a subject . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he originated Keep Illinois Beautiful , a statewide cleanup campaign . But Moga did n't share the chronic Jaycee proclivity for foolishness . At a state convention he was reading a report on his beautification work when Jaycees from East St. Louis trooped in with a giant Budweiser can , hoping their town 's famed beer would attract next years meeting . " I got di -- gusted . The chairman rapped for order . but nobody would listen . They all stood up and yelled about the beer can . I walked off the platform . That ended it with me and the Jaycees . " Aurorans knew Moga as the sometime basketball announcer for a local radio station ? and he says unabashedly he was a good one . Moga dropped into his broadcaster 's voice to demonstrate his technique . telling how he described " a scuffle between two colored boys " at a tourney . " Come on . Peaches . give ' em some skin and lets get this show on the road . " Moga laughed . " I did n't have to say they were colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... folks here were laughing about it for days . " Moga entered politics almost by impulse ' Five years ago he was working for an Aurora trucking firm . One morning factory workers were slow unloading one of his trucks . and he went over to speed them along . Moga gave the men cigars and joshed to a bystander that he hoped " the hillbillies " ? an Aurora term for Southern immigrants ? would work faster . The shop steward . who was also a local elected official . objected to the term and ordered the men off the truck . When Moga returned there was a hitter confrontation . The steward accused Moga of prejudice and called him " a hunks bastard from Pigeon referring to Moga 's Romanian ancestry and the East Aurora neighborhood where he was horn . There were no fisticuffs . But Moga made an instant decision : " I 'm going into politics . I said . Here was a man whose family had run a  | goddamned whorehouse -- that 's where all his money came from ? here was this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get his kind out of office was for people like me to run for office . So I did . " Moga did n't challenge the shop steward directly ; what he did was run for County Board , and win handily . ( Johnny Moga The Plumber met the steward later at a wedding reception on Pigeon Hill and told him he did n't like the term " hunky bastard . " The conversation continued : " You going to leave , and you going to leave now ? by the door or through the wall . Now which you prefer ? " ) After four years on the County Board ? a parttime job ? Moga bucked the Republican organization to become Township Supervisor . His principal duty is administering the welfare program , in some of which he takes a personal interest because , as he says , " I 'm one of the biggest homeowning taxpayers in East Aurora , " paying $1,200 per year on his house . " Animals , " Moga calls his welfare clients . " They breed like animals , live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , would n't do . " He gave me examples : A caseworker visited a welfare recipient just released from the hospital . " She had to go through this living room where three or four big colored bucks were sitting drinking . I told her never to go in a house like that again . Now there 's a case for you ? a $360 hospital bill . They ai n't anever gon na pay that -- the taxpayers are going to pay it . . . . All they do is take ? they never put . " Moga chuckled at his ingenuity in disposing of cases . " We had a woman come in here who had family in Peoria . She wanted money . I asked if the family would take care of her if she got to Peoria , and she said yeah . So I called a gas station and said ive her a tank so she could get out of town . That 's one we do n't worry about no more . " We switched suddenly to the war , for Moga 's opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in large part responsible for his views on Vietnam . Indeed , Moga asserted , the fact that Aurora is heavily Romanian and Hungarian is responsible for the town 's militancy . He lowered his voice , as if he did n't want to appear to be indulging in ethnic boasting . " Certain kinds of boys from certain backgrounds are more patriotic than others . They learn to jump at the sound of an order . Discipline . There 's discipline in these homes . Percentagewise , of all the Aurora boys in the war , the highest number was from the Hungarian and Romanian communities , Pigeon Hill , where I was raised . The same for the dead ? go over to the cemetery , look at the tombstones . Most of the names , Hungarian , Romanian . When a guy is in the trench and the lieutenant blows the whistle and says , Let 's o. there 's always a percentage that stays behind . Boys with background are the ones who go .

Tom Frey , forty-three , an electrical engineer . is a civilian employee at Patrick . as are most of his neighbors , and he is archetypical of the technocrats who keep Modern America working more or less as it should . Soon after graduation from the University of Illinois , Frey worked for a St. Louis brewery . installing a new plant . then for the Ralston Purina Company . The transition from beer and Wheat Chex to missiles was nothing more than a change of jobs . He is decidedly unsympathetic to  | things out of the ordinary . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by association . " We fell out with Huntley and Brinkley several ' years ago when they did a special on our area . They interiewed mostly prostitutes and showed bars and cocktail lounges . They could have presented the Cape Kennedy area in a better vein . " I remarked that some of my friends in the aerospace industry had said Cape Kennedy and environs was a swinging area . " That may be , " Frey said . " We do n't smoke , we do n't drink , so that leaves out parties for us . " Huntley and Brinkley notwithstanding , Frey considers TV his prime source of news . " Frankly , I 've become disillusioned with the papers . You read a speech , and the stories do n't say the same thing you heard when the man said it on television . " Both Frey and his wife described themselves as busy readers ? he prefers spy novels , she historical novels ? but they have n't gotten around to any books on the war . ( " I think it the war is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists took North Vietnam , and now they want to take South Vietnam . " ) Barbara Frey , nineteen , a college student , had been listening to us . " Are there any Vietnam books ? " she asked . Before I left she came in with pad and pencil and asked for some titles . She also mentioned students who participated in Moratorium activities . " I thought they were kind of stupid . Why , they were even standing on desks . I think people who make laws know more about what is happening than we do . " Tom Frey , who has worked around the Air Force the past six years , thinks it should have been permitted to bomb Haiphong and Hanoi ? " get in there and get it over with , quick . " Political realities being what they are , he knows this is not now to happen . But he is most willing to leave the war in Mr. Nixon 's hands ; as he wrote the President : " It is understandable that we can not be told everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's problems , perhaps you could explain to us why the dissenting group in this country seems to be made up of people who have the most to lose if we do not help keep the world free .... " @# Home . A brick rancher , the driveway curving through the snow to a three-car parking area , basketball goal , and the ice-crusted tracks of a snowplow . " They do n't work as good as a shovel , do they ? " Moga said . A 36-foot flagpole on the front lawn . " Did n't cost me a thing . I welded it myself , even got the ball and the eagle at the top . " Moga stopped . " I hope I 'm never in the vicinity of a crowd where somebody burns an American flag . " Why ? " I do n't think I could control myself . I think I 'd do something awful to the people ? kick the hell out of them , even kill them . I do n't think anybody could hold me back . " Joyce Moga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ironing in the kitchen . We joke about husbands who do n't warn they are bringing company home , and about wives who do n't like to be caught wearing curlers while they are ironing . " The living room . Family history . Bobby Moga 's Uncle Jack was a city policeman whose ferocity alarmed even his colleagues , inclined to end tavern quarrels by banging the relevant heads until the noise ended . " In the old days there were no squad cars . At the end of a shift each officer walked his prisoners to the station house . One snowy morning Uncle Jack was checking doors in an alley when he saw an officer with a prisoner fall . Uncle Jack started after the prisoner , and the officer yelled , No , Jack , no , he did n't do anything ; I slipped and fell .. " ' Moga smiled . " The policeman knew good and well that Uncle Jack would have killed that prisoner with his bare hands for hitting an officer . " Many of Moga 's stories had this undercurrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swedes in baseball , a social event replete with cheering women and kegs of beer behind the screen , and gradually escalating enthusiasm for victory . There was an argument at home plate while Uncle Sam Moga was batting , and he turned and lifted the mask from the Swede catcher . " They had to call an ambulance to haul the Swede away when Sam finished him , " Bobby Moga laughed , as did his eight-year-old son , sitting with us . Moga 's brother Romulus . " Rome , we call him , he was the fifth in a row to have the name . " Rome was killed in the Battle of Java Sea in 1942 , and a boy brought the telegram on Sunday morning . " We decided to keep the word from Mom until we knew for sure . We did this for two weeks . She heard . There were four Aurora boys on the USS Houston , and two of them were killed . She heard from a reporter . " A TV news show from Chicago . Bert Quint of CBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the mouth of a dead North Vietnamese , clowning and smiling for onlookers and the camera . " That 's the sort of thing that should n't be shown , " Moga said . " It depresses you . " Sources of information on the war ? " I read books , magazines , everything , I ca n't sit down without reading , even on the throne . The car radio , television . No , no books . I do n't have time , no . See , I get calls out of the house all the time ? people in trouble , that sort of thing . I 'm a very busy man , a public official . Why the other night , I got a call from a guy who had been in a stabbing at a club . A Republican committeeman , and I had to take care of it , get him out on recognizance . All sorts of things like that .... " The newspaper in which Bobby Moga and other Aurorans read about the war and Nixon policies is the Aurora Beacon-News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although the Beacon was the first Copley newspaper ( Ira C. Copley , sometime colonel , natural-gas entrepreneur and Aurora resident , bought it in 1905 ) the editorial tone of the fiercely conservative chain is set by the flagship paper , the San Diego Union , which Herb Klein edited for ten years . During my visit the Beacon was publishing a series on the Moratorium by Francis J. McNamara , longtime staff director of the House Un-American 77  | Activities Committee . " The most important fact about the demonstrations , " McNamara wrote for the 26 Copley papers and the 340 newspaper clients of the Copley news service , " was the revelation of a weakness in U. S. ability to deal effectively with internal Communist subversion . " M rs . Hugh Armstrong lives in Jesup , in the turpentine and pulp-wood country of southern Georgia . What she said to Mr. Nixon , and why , is best expressed in her letter itself , which she decided could be published after an hour 's consultation with the son she discusses in it : Just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying our son Tony was burned over 50% of his body , arms , face , and legs . He was a Cobra pilot in the 1st Air Cav and a good one ? he won two distinguished flying crosses . For 51/2 months he was in Yokohama , Japan , and Brooke Gen. Hosp. in Texas ? 14 skin grafts . He 'll never have the use of his right hand , the bones were too badly burned , he 'll also wear rubber hose on his legs for the better part of his life ? but thank God he came home and cheered us up .... Now what I want to say , your speech was a " good one . " My husband and I both feel it 's the only honorable way . Every time we see our friends ' sons 1r " +e for Vietnam our hearts bleed for them , an . ' . e pray they never know the anxiety we sr : , I.

Joyce Moga bright-eyed and smiling in a new dress , excited about a night out . Hardfrozen snow pushed into the infield , mid-20s temperatures . " This was a drafty old barn last year , " Moga said . " But Johnny my brother put in a new heating system . Feels pretty good . eh ? Johnny has it heated up real nice . " Aisle table . Bobby did some politicking . " Hi-ya Hallie boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can run ? " He bounced around the chair , looking into the stands and behind us for friends and acquaintances and for people who should see him in the honored guest area . Bobby was serious about the trotters , and after we ordered prime ribs he excused himself for the first of many whispered consultations with assorted insiders . His brother-in-law , a track faithful , had 78 talked to a trainer who knew a jockey and knew something special about a race . 1 The lost . ) " I think all of this is silly , " Joyce Moga We bet ? and lost ? the first three races , foil faithfully Ambassador Annenberg 's form " Let 's use my system , " Joyce Moga said .

Bobby Moga threw a pile of mutuel slips on the table and we went home . After midnight I tried to find something to before going to sleep . The bookcase in the guest room contained William Shirer 's Berlin a world atlas . a collected works of Shakespea Dell Crossword Dictionary , The Day Christ Jim Bishop , The Exciting Story of the White ( about their pennant year ) , and the Hand Beauty .
