When he introduced movable type in the 15th century , German Printer Johann Gutenberg knew what the public wanted : a Bible . In the U.S. , Protestant and Roman Catholic publishers alike found it profitable to follow Gutenberg 's lead . Bibles and hymnals , missals and prayer books , inspirational and theological works always had a certain dependable bread-and-butter market . Religious periodicals were a bonanza - with a combined circulation , in the mid- ' 60s , estimated at nearly 60 million . But the crisis in Christian faith during the late 1960s and divisions over doctrinal and social issues within Protestantism and Catholicism have changed the situation . Religious publishing is in serious trouble . <P> Catholic publications have suffered most in recent months . Sheed and Ward , once among the most flourishing of Catholic book publishers , has retrenched to a skeleton staff and a spare list of new books . Commonweal , the most intellectual of U.S. Catholic weeklies , has appealed to its readers for funds to survive . Herder Correspondence , a scholarly international Roman Catholic monthly , died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine , tried to keep 105 years of publication history alive by changing its name , content and format ; but the replacement , A.D. 1970 , expired two weeks ago after only 18 issues . And despite an enviable record of reportorial scoops , the aggressively liberal National Catholic Reporter has lost 22% of its circulation over the past 18 months . <P> The latest symptom of crisis occurs this week when the National Register , a 43-year-old weekly Catholic newspaper supported widely by U.S. bishops , will be taken over by Twin Circle Publishing Co. , a right-wing Catholic enterprise supported by Schick Millionaire Patrick J. Frawley . <P> Council Victim . The $500,000 purchase agreement , reportedly financed by Frawley , solved the immediate fiscal problems facing the Register publishers , Denver 's Catholic Press Society . The paper 's national edition was down from 190,000 at the beginning of 1969 to 112,000 recently ; the number of its diocesan editions dropped from a high of 36 to 25 . <P> Like many other victims in the Catholic publishing world , the Register was also a remote casualty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years 1962-65 , Catholic publishing enjoyed a remarkable boom that inspired what Cross Currents Editor Joseph Cunneen calls " unreal expectations . " Moreover , the widespread liturgical experimentation encouraged by Vatican II seriously undermined a profitable " black book " trade in breviaries , missals and hymnals . Many Catholic bookstores , dependent on these items and such increasingly unpopular devotional accessories as rosaries and statues , simply went out of business , thus depriving publishers of one of their major outlets . Rapid developments in theology compounded the problem , often outdating books before they appeared . Eventually , the tide of reform following the Council produced a reaction among traditional Catholics-a shock manifested by their rejection of publications that brought them the discomfiting news .
