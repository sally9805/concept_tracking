Boston was spared the major racial violence that at one time or another during the last decade flared in most major U.S. cities . But the persistent frictions of blacks and whites in close urban proximity are a fact of life in Boston as nearly everywhere . Youthful gangs of blacks and whites engaged in several street fights last summer , and recently the racial feeling in the racially mixed neighborhood of Dorchester grew so dangerous that authorities closed a public high school for two days . Yet nothing in the city 's mood or texture remotely prepared Bostonians for what happened there last week : two of the most vicious , apparently racial , murders in memory . <P> The first victim was Evelyn Wagler , 24 , a Swiss divorcee who had moved to Boston only five days earlier and was living in a small commune in the city 's Roxbury ghetto with another white and four black women . While she was on her way home from a job-hunting trip , her car ran out of gasoline in the center of Roxbury 's business district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a service station , the young woman was forced into a trash-filled backyard along Blue Hill Avenue by six black teenagers , beaten and ordered to douse herself with the fuel . After the terrified victim complied , one of them set her afire with a match . Before dying five hours later , she told police that three of her assailants had been part of a black group that had called her a " honky " the previous day and warned her that whites were unwelcome in Roxbury . <P> Appalled by the immolation murder , Boston 's whites poured out rage and alarm on local talk-show radio programs . They were quickly echoed by blacks , who realize all too well that the residents of a neighborhood quickly become the primary victims of any crime rampage started there . " Everyone in the black community is upset , " said State Representative Royal Bolling . " This is one of the most horrible things to ever happen in our area . " Nevertheless , the tension soon found a fresh point at Andrew Square in a declining white neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Columbia Point . After fending off an attack by white youths , a black gang armed with clubs and knives collected around a Columbia Point school , forcing jittery authorities to close it . As a result , large groups of idle black teenagers were soon wandering the area , and in quick succession they claimed three white victims . Two of them were stabbed and robbed , and Ludivico Barba , 65 , a retired contractor who was fishing off rocks at the point in his rubber waders , was stoned by a gang of about 30 youths . They then stabbed him to death and robbed him . <P> Boston Mayor Kevin White offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the capture of Mrs. Wagler 's murderers , and police soon arrested two suspects , aged 15 and 16 , in the Barba killing . The mayor made a point of keeping all Boston schools open on Friday , claiming that despite the week 's double horror his city " is still the most livable , walkable , decent city in America . " But many parents-both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the savage eruption of violence might not yet have run its course .
