It was a crisis of light , and of darkness-the kind of event that brings out the best and the worst in people . Certainly the 1965 blackout could never happen again , or so New Yorkers had thought . But something very much like it struck Wednesday the 13th , only this time it was frighteningly different . Through the long , sweaty night and most of the following day , the nation 's largest city was powerless , lacking both the electricity on which it depends so heavily and any means to stop a marauding minority of poor blacks and Hispanics who , in severe contrast to 1965 , went on a rampage , the first since the hot summer riots of the 1960s . They set hundreds of fires and looted thousands of stores , illuminating in a perverse way twelve years of change in the character of the city , and perhaps of the country . <P> For a short while after the lights flickered out , most New Yorkers refused to believe that a crisis was at hand and gamely carried on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by stagehands ; the nude cast of Oh ! Calcutta ! , unable to grope to their dressing rooms , borrowed clothes from members of the audience and went home in cabs . Waiters at Manhattan restaurants served patrons by candlelight . Buses were delayed only slightly by darkened traffic lights . Garbage trucks whined as usual on their nightly rounds . Mayor Abraham Beame , assuming , like many citizens , that a fuse had blown , ad-libbed a quip during a campaign speech at the Co-op City Traditional Synagogue in The Bronx . " See , " he said . " This is what you get for not paying your bills . " <P> Gradually , however , the realization took over that the unthinkable had happened : at 9:34 on one of the summer 's most sweltering nights , air conditioners , elevators , subways , lights , water pumps - all the electric sinews of a great modern city-had stopped . They would not work again for as long as 25 hours . The blackout was far smaller than that of 1965-9 million people lost electricity in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in eight states and two Canadian provinces twelve years ago . But the effects were nationwide . TV networks stopped broadcasting for several minutes . The flow of teletyped news from the A.P . and U.P.I , was interrupted , then limped along under jury rigs ( see THE PRESS ) . Wall Street 's banks , brokerages , and stock and commodities exchanges shut down for a day . <P> Beame declared a state of emergency in New York . The city sent extra policemen and fire fighters to the ghettos , portable generators to hospitals , and set up banks of operators to handle citizens ' calls for help . But His Honor , who at 71 is running hard for a second term , also began searching for someone to blame . Without bothering to wait for the verdict of investigations ordered by himself , Governor Hugh Carey and President Carter , the mayor quickly zeroed in on Consolidated Edison Co. , the company that New Yorkers love to hate ( see ECONOMY &; BUSINESS ) . Declared Beanie : " Con Ed 's performance is , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far more serious . " Responded Con Ed Chairman Charles Luce : " It 's a little like saying , ' We 'll have a fair trial before we hang the defendant . ' "
