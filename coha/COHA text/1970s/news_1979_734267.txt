txt The Supreme Court removed a major threat to President Carter 's anti-inflation program today by declining to adcept a case testing the program 's constitutionality . The Court decided , 6 to 3 , hot to hear an appeal by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations , which had challenged the President 's authority to use the Government 's purchasing power to enforce wage and price guidelines . The decision means that ' the Administration can deny Federal contracts to companies that violate the wage or price guidelines . One of Only Two Companies However , a Defense Department spokesman said in an interview today that the Pentagon had decided to give a $77 million contract for jet fuel to the Amerada Hess Corporation , one of only two companies that the Government has listed so far as having violated the guidelines . The large oil refining and marketing company had previously said that " we regret " that the price guidelines , as established by the Government , " do not allow Amerada Hess to comply . " The Defense Department spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order " to satisfy critical fuel requirements in the Atlantic , European and Mediterranean theaters . " He added that the Government would have had to spend an additional $49 million to purchase the jet fuel in the international market . In refusing to hear the appeal today , the Supreme Court did not rule on the merits of organized labor 's case against the President 's program . As is customary when declining a petition for a writ of certiorari , or appeal , the court did not state its reasons . Laurence Gold , counsel for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. , said this afternoon that the court 's decision " settles nothing . " " Where the issue goes from here is open to question , " he added . " There will be other cases . We will see how the law develops . " Alfred E. Kahn , the President 's chief adviser on inflation , issued a terse statement after the court 's decision saying , " We are pleased the review process is over , and our authority is upheld . " ' Mr. Kahn had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was illegal for the Government to use its purchasing power to enforce the guidelines had had an " adverse psychological impact " on the program , although he said that self-restraint was more important in making the guidelines work . Administration officials are considering whether to use the sanction authority to scale back recent wage and price actions they have criticized , ? such as the recent contract settlement by the United Rubber Workers union and the settlement at ' United Airlines . Presumably the Government could stop flying mail and Government officials an the airline , but no such action has yet been announced . 7 Percent Ware Standard Set The rubber workers reached a settlement with tire makers that the union 's president , Peter C. Bommarito , said far exceeded the wage guidelines aimed at holding settlements reached this year to raises of no more than 22.5 percent over three years . The wage standards ask workers to bold increases to 7 percent or less this year . Officials of United Airlines estimated that its contract with the International Association of Machinists would raise labor casts by 34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pact fell within guideline limits . On May 31 , Judge Barrington D. Parker of the Federal District Court here ruled that President Carter had exceeded his authority by using the Government 's purchasing power to enforce the anti-inflation program . In effect , Judge Parker decided , the President had usurped powers reserved to Congress by making the program mandatory . However , the United States Court of Appeals here overturned Judge Parker 's decision by a 640-3 vote on June 22 . The appeals court majority found that the President bad the authority to impose Federal purchasing sanctions on violators of guidelines to relieve national distress caused by " a cruel period of inflation . " The appeals court said that the use of such sanctions did not violate Congress 's specific prohibition against mandatory wage and price controls . The lower court 's decision declaring the guidelines illegal never went into effect because Judge Parker stayed his order , pending the appeals process . The President 's anti-inflation program began last October . So far , only Amerada Hess and the cement division of Ideal Basic Industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which limit increases in wages and prices . The labor federation 's appeal fell one short of the four votes required to be accepted by the Supreme Court . Only Justices William Brennan Jr. , Byron White and Thurgood Marshall voted to hear the case . ' Mystified ' by Court 's Refusal Laurence Silberman , a lawyer representing members of Congress who joined in the suit against the guidelines as " friends of the court , " said this afternoon that he was " mystified " by the Court 's refusal to grant a writ of certiorari . One possibility suggested by Mr. Silberman was that the court deemed it unnecessary to review the case because the Administration was now reviewing its anti-inflation program , and the whole question of Federal purchasing sanctions imposed by executive order might become moot . Mr. Silberman and Mr. Gold both said that another reason the court might have decided not to hear the case was that the majority agreed with the appeals court 's decision .                 @ @ @ @
