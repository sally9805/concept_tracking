Hell in Ice DEVOUR THE SNOW by Abe Polsky <P> The fate of the Donner Party is a macabre legend in the winning of the West . A group of families set out from Illinois for California in 1846 . Trapped in the Sierra Nevada Mountains by an early snowfall , they built crude shelters of logs and hides . They ate their animals and their shoes . But the darkest art of the 47 survivors out of a party of 82 was to eat their own dead . <P> Out of this dire saga , Polsky has fashioned a grim drama about the existential anguish of last resorts . The play is fascinating even when its revelations are most appalling . Presented at off-Broadway 's Hudson Guild Theater , Devour the Snow differs markedly from the spate of terminal situation dramas now in vogue in that it does not possess a moment of comic relief . Polsky means his play to be harrowing , and it is . <P> He has used a little-known incident as the fulcrum of the drama . A survivor , Lewis Keseberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against other members of the group , led by James Reed ( Berkeley Harris ) , who had accused him of theft and murder . Though Keseberg won his suit , the trial records do not exist , so the play is an imaginative reconstruction . <P> The thought that grips the playgoer 's imagination as he views the courtroom is that apart from the presiding officer , John A. Sutler ( Paul David Richards ) , and Sheriff McKinstry ( Bob Ari ) , most of the people present can only be there through having eaten human flesh . <P> On the physical level , the trial is concerned with who ate whom when . Even in cannibalism a pecking order is revealed . No particular stigma seems to be attached to having eaten two loyal Indian guides . Keseberg , being a German , is supposed to have acted out of depravity , while the native Americans plead pure necessity . When Keseberg reveals that he ate his own dead daughter , the horror of the primal taboo seems to invade the playhouse . It is as if one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his brother Thyestes the three sons of Thyestes , and the father , having learned what he had eaten , pronounced the awesome anathema that resonates through all of Greek tragedy . <P> Devour the Snow is a profoundly moral play in the guise of a murder thriller . Polsky probes areas of guilt , self-deception , self-corruption and the agonizing question of " What price survival ? " The cast is exemplary , and Jon De Vries as the tormented Keseberg sculptures a portrait of hell in ice . Toward the end , Polsky resorts to melodramatic devices that break the play 's stark tension , but he is a welcome addition to the select company of playwriting naturals . <P> - T.E .
