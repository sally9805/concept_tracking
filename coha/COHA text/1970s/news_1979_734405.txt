txt THE CITY OF THE broad shoulders became the city of the open arms Thursday as Pope John Paul II arrived in Chicago for his historic visit  --  the first ever by the leader of the Catholic Church . The smiling , obviously pleased pontiff began his 39-hour pilgrimage in Chicago shortly after 7 p.m. , when the visitor from Rome stepped off the Shepherd I jetliner to the cheers of more than 1,000 dignitaries and o t h e r well-wishers at O'Hare International Airport . The cold , chill wind of a typical Chicago October night blew over the many assembled at O'Hare and along the motorcade route that took the pontiff from the airport to Holy Name Cathedral on the city 's Near North Side . The visit made by Pepe John Paul II , a native-born Pole , was especially appropriate to Chicago , the world 's second-largest Polish-populated city , exceeded only by Warsaw . EXHIBITING THE LOVE of children shown throughout his travels through America , the pontiff was visibly charmed by a group of 30 youthful violin players , aged 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plane . Brushing past Secret Service agents and surrounded by local political dignitaries , the Pope walked over to the awed children and spoke to them in appreciation . The children related that the Pope repeatedly said : " Wonderful . That 's wonderful . You 're all wonderful . Ha , ha , ha , God bless you ; you 're wonderful , " as he walked toward them , touching them gently . Although a musical tour of Europe had been recently completed by members of the group , called the Suzuki Orchestra , one member , Jenny Ryan , 9 , said she was even more thrilled with the papal praise . " I think it 's a lot better than going to Europe , " she said . " It 's a once-in-a-lifetime chance . " In spite of his unscheduled chat with the young musicians , the Pope 's arrival at O'Hare was still only a 10-minute affair , with the pontiff exchanging words just briefly with the officials , including Mayor Byrne and Gov . Thompson . Accompanied by John Cardinal Cody , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the stairs , the pontiff entered his limousine , rolled down the window to wave his goodbyes , and traveled off along the motorcade route .

Polish bands played on street corners ; there were Irish bands at others . Meanwhile , at Holy Name Catheral , where the Pope made his first official statement to the people of the Chicago archdiocese , the largest in the United States , people had been gathering since 4 p.m. , occasionally breaking into impromptu song as they waited . ON MILWAUKEE Avenue , known by some as the State Street of the Polish community in Chicago , the heavy crowds could not contain their enthusiasm as the Pope rode by in the limousine with the protective plastic bubble removed . In spite of the heavy security along the route , the crowds surged forward as the motorcade approached , spilling into the streets and reducing it in width to a scant one lane at points . But it was a friendly , happy crowd , providing no real security worries for the police and Secret Service men . The festival atmosphere was intense at Holy Name Cathedral , the venerable 105-year-old bastion of Catholicism at State and Superior . It was at the cathedral where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly I would like to meet each one of you personally , to visit you in your homes , to walk your streets so that I may better underatand the richness of your personalities and the depth of your aspirations , " he said . " May . God uplift humanity in this great City of Chicago . " The Pope greeted the crowds at the cathedral with smiles , waves , and hand signs of blessing when he arrived from the airport . He then entered the main cathedral entrance , bedecked with banners of the papal colors of white and gold , and walked down the central aisle as sacred music filled the sanctuary . He knelt at the altar , praying , as the music continued and the awed spectators watched silently as the leader of all Catholics throughout the world worshiped in their holy place . THE POPE SAT in a chair in the center of the altar as " Ave Maria ' was sung by Luciano Pavarotti , the worldrenowned opera singer , who came to Chicago to perform on the historic occasion . The Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third city he visited during the day . His chin rested on his hand and he gazed down reflectively as the Italian tenor 's voice floated through the cathedral . John Cardinal Cody welcomed the Pope , expressing an " overwhelming sense of joy " at the arrival of the pontiff in Chicago . His greeting was met with lengthy applause by the spectators , and the Pope acknowledged the greeting with a smile and a wave of his hand . The Pope drew hearty laughs in the cathedral when he departed from his prepared text to identify Chicago as an " American city , " hut also the " second Polish city . " the ASSEMBLED priests were obviously thrilled by the Pope 's appearance , at times even standing on the pews to get a better view and to cheer the pontiff . His speech was interrupted seven times by applause . At the end of his address , the Pope was serenaded by the spectators with the traditional Polish song , " Sto Lat , " which means , " May you live a long life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join him ho singing " The Lord 's Prayer , " adding , " in Latino . " He then conferred the papal blessing and proceeded out of the cathedral to display once again the wit that has typified his appearances throughout the noBon . Standing before the wildly cheering crowd , the Pope said , " You must go sleep . You must go sleep . " HE ONCE AGAIN conferred the papal blessing on the crowd , then , in a mockstrict tone resembling a parent talking to a child , " Go sleep . " At one point , he . joined the crowds in singing " Alleluia " and acknowledged their chants of " Long live the Pope " with waves of his hand and a broad smile . But the Pope 's day in Chicago was not yet over . His motorcade continued to St. Peter 's Church in the Loop , where he addressed a large assembly of Franciscan brothers and members of other Catholic religious orders . Again , crowds cheered as he took a short stroll down Madison Street from his limousine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live the Pope , " sacrificing religious decorum to the emotion of the moment . The Pope 's message to the assemblage repeated his vow to maintain the order of celibacy and obedience demanded by the church . " THLS SPIRITUAL freedom which you received in baptism you have sought to increase and strengthen through your willing acceptance of the call to follow Jesus more closely in rawerty , chastity , anti obedience , " thy pontiff said . " No matter what others may contend or the word may believe , your promises to observe the evangelical counsels have not shackled your freedom . You are not less free because you are obedient , and you are not less loving because of your celibacy . On the contrary . " His message , delivered in a halting tone reflecting his weariness , received five-minute standing ovation from the brothers . His day nearly over , the Pope entered his limousine and was taken to Cardinal Cody 's residence . He had originally been scheduled to go to the residence for an hour between his appearances at Holy Name and St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stop was canceled so he could reach St. Peter 's approximately on schedule . HE ARRIVED at Cody 's mansion at 10:15 p.m. , just 15 minutes after his original schedule , in spite of the late start of his Chicago visit . More crowds at the Cody residence chanted praise , and the Pope waved Isis acknowledgement as he entered the house . Moments later , he emerged on a balcony and gestured with his hands in a motion of blessing . And then his hands revealed another message . Cupping them together , he placed them on his cheek , tilted his head in a sleeping motion , and smiling , reentered the mansion at 10:25 p.m . His Holiness had ended his first day in Chicago .
