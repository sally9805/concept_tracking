Women 's Liberation and youth 's emphasis on freedom have combined to produce a new phenomenon in the U.S. : female hitchhiking . It is a romantic notion dating back to Claudette Colbert 's in It Happened One Night . In at least one part of the country , however , it has not proved a salubrious mix . There have been 73 reported assaults on women hitchhikers in the Washington , D.C. , area so far this year . These are probably only a fraction of those that have occurred . <P> Nearly all the girl hitchhikers are white and under 20 . Their attackers , however , are generally not the " dirty old men " of lore , but young men in their 20s out cruising for trusting girls who feel " safe " riding with someone their own age . Said one policeman : " These girls believe their mothers ' stories about the ' dirty old men . ' They think anyone over 30 is out to get them . So they hop into a car driven by a young guy with long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most cases , are committing the assaults . " <P> Publicity about the danger has so far not kept the girls off the curbs . A generation of young women seem bent on proving that they are formidable enough to take care of themselves .
