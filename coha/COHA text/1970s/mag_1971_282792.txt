IN 1945 , when Deborah Skinner was eleven months old , she had a rather dubious distinction : she was the most talked-about infant in America-the famous " baby in a box . " The box , or " air crib " as her father called it , was his own invention , a glassed-in , insulated , air-controlled crib that he thought would revolutionize child rearing and , in line with his behaviorist theories , produce happier , healthier children . <P> One of the major practical problems in raising a young baby , Skinner reasoned , is the simple one of keeping it warm . The infant is usually covered by half a dozen layers of cloth-shirt , nightdress , sheet and blankets-that not only constrict movement and cause rashes , but sometimes even pose the danger of strangulation . Then there is the mother 's labor in dressing and undressing the child , plus the considerable expense of buying and laundering all those clothes and blankets . <P> To eliminate those troubles , Skinner designed Deborah 's crib with temperature and humidity controls so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides the hoped-for results-Deborah never suffered from a rash , for instance-the crib provided an unexpected fringe benefit : the Skinners discovered that the baby was so sensitive to even the slightest change in temperature that she could be made happy simply by moving the thermostat a notch or two . " We wonder how a comfortable temperature is ever reached with clothing and blankets , " Skinner wrote in a 1945 issue of Ladies ' Home Journal . " During the past six months Deborah has not cried at all except for a moment or two when injured or sharply distressed-for example , when inoculated . " <P> The air in the box was passed through filters , keeping Deborah free from germs and so clean that it was necessary to give her only one bath a week . There was the usual diaper change , but little other laundering ; a single , 10-yd. - long sheet was stored on a spool at one end of the compartment and rolled through into a hamper on the other end as it was soiled ; it had to be laundered just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a shade could be drawn over the plate-glass window . <P> Skinner was sensitive to criticism that Deborah was isolated . In his articles and lectures , he took pains to stress that she could watch everything that was taking place in the room about her , and that she was frequently taken out for cuddling and play . To many people , however , the air box sounded and looked like an atrocious human goldfish bowl . <P> The continuing controversy about the box may have partially offset the good effects Skinner hoped for when he designed it . Says Deborah , who is now an art student in London : " It was spread around that because of the box I had become psychotic , had to be institutionalized , and had even attempted suicide . My father was very concerned about these rumors , as was I. He thinks they may have affected me . After college , I had a typical half-year of depression , the sort of identity crisis that everybody I 've ever known has gone through . At this point my father brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in myself , and that the rumors may have had something to do with this . "
