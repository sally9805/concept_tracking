For tall , burly Pat Benedict , 44 , the day begins as early as it did for farmers in Mesopotamia in 8000 B.C. He rises before dawn to pull on boots , blue jeans and work shirt . By 6 a.m. he is breakfasting with some neighbors at the Double D Diner off Interstate 94 outside Sabin , Minn. ( pop . 333 ) . For an hour or so , he trades community gossip , argues about politics and drops casual remarks about crops and prices designed to feel out what his fellow farmers are doing without asking them a direct question , which is taboo . Then off to the fields-and into the computer age . <P> Benedict makes a quick trip by pickup truck around his 3,500 acres of wheat and sugar beets . At each of many stops he whips out a pocket calculator and does some rapid figuring before giving the hired hands orders on , say , exactly how much pesticide to spray on each field . By 8 a.m. he is heading home to start the most important part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his small study . There Benedict goes over computer print-outs analyzing his plantings acre by acre : inputs of seed , fertilizer , irrigation water , machine time ; output in bushels and dollars . He draws up precise operating schedules for his half-million dollars ' worth of machinery ; after all , every gallon of fuel saved adds a few more cents to profit . His print-outs also help him ponder marketing strategy ( when should he time the sale of his crops to get the best price ? ) and financial problems ( how can he distribute the stock in his family corporation so that his wife and seven children pay the lowest estate taxes ? ) . <P> Sometimes he pauses to reflect wistfully that the demands of managing a business with $3.5 million in assets keep him from doing as much of the actual planting and harvesting as he would like . Says Benedict : " I miss it , because spending eight hours in a tractor cab is a therapeutic kind of work . But I ca n't assign myself an all-day task running a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move about to make sure that it all comes together . " <P> For a farmer to complain that he does not get to spend enough time in the fields must be something new in the 10,000-year history of agriculture . But in the U.S. of 1978 , Pat Benedict is archetypal of the farmers who make U.S. agriculture the nation 's most efficient and productive industry and by far the biggest force holding down the trade deficit . Revolutionary changes are sweeping the croplands , making agriculture an increasingly capital-intensive , hightechnology , mass-production business . As a result , U.S. farmers are dividing into two distinct classes . Small farmers , who do not have the technical expertise , are rapidly leaving the land . Large farmers , like Benedict , who know how to use credit and the latest in agricultural science , are gaining an ever greater share of the market . They produce most of the food that the U.S. eats and almost all that it sells to the world . <P> To succeed in this fast-changing , low-margin business , a fellow has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn , soybeans and hogs in Sangamon County , Ill. : " It used to be that if you had a child who was n't too bright , you 'd say , ' Son , you 're going to be a farmer . ' Nowadays , if that dumb kid comes along volunteering to farm , you 've got to say ,
