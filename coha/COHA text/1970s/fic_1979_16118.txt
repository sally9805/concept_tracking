FADE IN : 1 EXT . SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT A quiet upper-middle class neighborhood . The CAMERA is at the curb , looking down the street . There are no sidewalks . Trees arch overhead . CICADAS drone on the soundtrack . The OPENING TITLES briefly FADE IN and OUT , framed by the trees on either side of the street . Footsteps are heard approaching . As the picture TITLE FADES , out of the dark emerges a GIRL 17 years old , carrying schoolbooks . This is JILL . CAMERA PANS with her ninety degrees as she comes to the front of a house and stops . Lights are on in the bottom half of the house , and the curtains across the windows are open .

Jill stops dead , listens , then continues forward even more cautiously . 7 INT . KITCHEN As Jill enters . She can not find the lightswitch , so she stands in the darkness listening . Again the rattle , very close now . Jill turns her head sharply , then walks to the refrigerator and opens it . It is only the automatic icemaker creating the rattle .

CUT TO : 9 INT . LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Jill is standing at the wet bar in the corner , pouring herself a drink . She samples the alcohol , does n't cough , and starts to pour a little more into the glass . The phone rings . Jill turns , then slowly walks to the table , kneels down and quietly picks up the phone and brings it to her ear . She waits and listens , a full three seconds . No sound comes to her .

He 's trying to scare me . &nbsp; SACKER ( O.S. ) An anonymous caller ? &nbsp; JILLThat 's right . &nbsp; SACKER ( O.S. ) Has he threatened you ? &nbsp; JILLNo . &nbsp; SACKER ( O.S. ) Has he been using obscene language ?  --  16  --  &nbsp; JILLNo . He just keeps calling me . Sometimes he does n't say anything . &nbsp; SACKER ( O.S. ) There 's really nothing we can do about it down here . Is the phone listed in your name ? &nbsp; JILLNo , I 'm just the babysitter . &nbsp; SACKER ( O.S. ) It 's probably just some weirdo . The city 's full of them .

It 's nothing to worry about . &nbsp; SACKER ( O.S. ) Or you could just take your phone off the hook . &nbsp; JILLNo , the people I 'm babysitting for might try to reach me . &nbsp; SACKER ( O.S. ) Well , as I say , there 's nothing we can really do to help you down here .  --  17  --  &nbsp; JILLOkay . Thank you . &nbsp; SACKER ( O.S. ) You bet . Goodnight . &nbsp; JILLGoodnight . Jill hangs up .

Then the phone rings . Jill moves quickly from the window to the table and answers the phone . &nbsp; JILLHello ? Pause . &nbsp; DUNCAN ( O.S. ) Why have n't you checked the children ? Stunned , Jill hangs up the phone . She turns and goes slowly back to the window . She pulls the shutters closed in front of the window .

Jill hangs up the phone and looks forlornly off into space . CUT TO : 13 INT . LIVING ROOM - LATER Jill is sitting on the sofa , a drink in one hand , a cigarette in the other . She is waiting . She sets her glass down , stubs out the cigarette , leans back and sighs . She is very tense . Then the phone rings . She rises from the sofa and slowly crosses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone . During this conversation it becomes apparent that the VOICE has a slight English accent . &nbsp; JILLHello ? Pause .  --  21  --  &nbsp; DUNCAN ( O.S. ) It 's me . &nbsp; JILLI know . Who are you ? Pause . No answer . &nbsp; JILL ( CONT 'D ) I wo n't be here much longer .

The phone rings and Jill snatches it up . &nbsp; JILLLeave me alone ! &nbsp; SACKER ( O.S. ) Jill , this is Sergeant Sacker ! Listen to me ! ( beat ) We 've traced the call . It 's coming from within the house . A squad car 's on its way over there now . . . just get out of that house ! Jill hangs up . She stands frozen in shock . Several seconds go by . She does n't move . Then the phone rings . She turns and tiptoes toward the front door . Halfway there , the phone stops ringing . She pauses for a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRONT HALL Jill reaches the front door . Carefully , quietly , she turns the bolt . Then O.S. she hears a creak . She turns and looks up the staircase . At the top , a door is opening . Someone is coming out ! A mumbling sound is heard on the sound track . Jill whirls around back to the door and yanks at it . It opens , but only an inch . The chain is still across it ! She frantically works to get the chain free . After agonizing seconds , the chain falls clear and the door swings open .  --  23  --  Standing there on the other side of the door , is a police Detective , JOHN CLIFFORD . ( We have cut ahead in time some twenty or thirty minutes . ) Behind him on the street , several patrol cars and an ambulance are pulled up at the curb , their domelights silently flashing . &nbsp; CLIFFORDAre the parents here yet ? &nbsp; COP 'S VOICE ( O.S. ) Yeah , they arrived about ten minutes ago . &nbsp; CLIFFORDChrist ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOICE ( O.S. ) They wanted to talk to someone . I asked them to wait until you got here . Come on in . Clifford sighs and steps into the front hall . The door is closed by the uniformed COP with whom Clifford has been speaking . The cop is a man in his thirties . His name is CHARLES GARBER . Garber and Clifford stand in the front hall and talk as POLICEMEN and AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS move around them . In the living room beyond can be seen several other POLICEMEN , Dr. Mandrakis and his wife . &nbsp; GARBERWe were only a block away when the call went out . When we got here , the guy was still waiting upstairs in the children 's bedroom . He was covered with blood . &nbsp; CLIFFORDBlood ? &nbsp; GARBERNot his own . The children had been dead for several hours . &nbsp; CLIFFORDJesus . . . &nbsp; GARBERHe 'd been using an old phone in their bedroom that the parents had never had disconnected.  --  24  --  &nbsp; CLIFFORDWho is he ? &nbsp; GARBERWe found a Merchant Seaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country less than a week ago . &nbsp; CLIFFORDHow about the babysitter ? &nbsp; GARBERShe 's going to be all right . As Garber delivers his final line , we see ambulance attendants dressed in white , taking a sheet-covered stretcher out the front door . FADE OUT : FADE IN : &nbsp; pp. 25-43 15 EXT . STREET - LATER AFTERNOON An upper-class neighborhood . The CAMERA is facing down the street . A car approaches the intersection at the end of the block , turns and comes slowly up the street . Because it is not a new car or an expensive car , and because it is moving at a rate which suggests that its sole male occupant is looking for house numbers , we can assume that the DRIVER is a visitor to this neighborhood . The CAMERA PANS with the car ninety degrees as it turns into the semi-circular driveway of a mansion and rolls up to the front door . A TITLE appears across the bottom of the screen : 4:30 pm Thursday , April 20 , 1978 As the TITLE FADES , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get out . CUT TO : 16 INT . MANSION - DAY The doorbell rings . A HOUSEBOY comes into the front hall , goes to the door and opens it for the visitor . It is John Clifford , the detective from six years ago .  --  25  --  He has aged noticeably over the years . His hair is grayer , his stance not so aggressive , but his eyes still smoulder with the accumulated frustration of having spent years in an uncertain , sometimes unsatisfying , and frequently unsafe occupation . No words are exchanged as the houseboy leads Clifford across the entrance hall and up an imposing flight of stairs . Still keen in his observation of things , Clifford quickly takes in this new atmosphere . The house is richly decorated but with an underlying theme of melancholy . There are no bright or cheerful furnishings , and the houseboy advances with guarded tread , his face steady and reverent . The houseboy stops before a door at the top of the staircase and raps lightly on it with his knuckles . Without waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Clifford to enter . Clifford pauses briefly , then walks into what appears to be an upstairs study . 17 INT . STUDY - DAY A MAN is sitting behind a desk which faces the door . Presumably he is the master of the house . Although his face is hidden in shadows , we can see from his hands that he is engaged in writing something down . Clifford quietly approaches the desk and takes a seat in front of it . Then , vaguely in keeping with the spirit of the house , he waits to be spoken to rather than interrupt the pervasive stillness . After a moment , the master of the house lays down his pen and leans back in his chair . Pause . &nbsp; MASTERSo you 're in business for yourself now . &nbsp; CLIFFORD ( quietly ) Yes , sir , for the past three and a half years .  --  26  --  &nbsp; MASTERThat 's good . ( beat ) And you 'd heard about Curt Duncan 's escape ? &nbsp; CLIFFORDOh , yes . &nbsp; MASTERDo you think the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLIFFORDI know they have n't assigned anyone to it specifically . It 's an old case . &nbsp; MASTER ( a tinge of bitterness ) An old case . ( beat ) Can you find him ? &nbsp; CLIFFORDYes . Maybe not tomorrow , maybe not this week , but I 'll find him . &nbsp; MASTERHe could be anywhere by now . &nbsp; CLIFFORDI do n't think so . . . because he 's a foreigner . He 'll come back to the city . After six years in confinement , it 's the only place that 's familiar to him . That 's important . Pause . &nbsp; MASTERA man murders two children in cold blood . A jury declares him insane . How could such a person not be ?  --  27  --  Clifford lowers his eyes , does n't answer . &nbsp; MASTER ( CONT 'D ) He is sent to a state mental institution where the security is. . . less than perfect . And he escapes . It . . . it is n't fair . The master of the house leans way forward over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows and into the light . It is Dr. Mandrakis . He seems much older . His complexion is pallid . His eyes stare out from beneath his brow like a wounded animal hiding in a dark cave . &nbsp; MANDRAKISA thing like that should never be allowed to happen again . &nbsp; CLIFFORDI could n't agree with you more . They look at each other for a long moment of acknowledgment . Then Mandrakis stands up with a sigh . &nbsp; MANDRAKISGo ahead then . My accountant will contact you . Clifford stands and they shake hands . &nbsp; CLIFFORDThank you . ( beat ) How is Mrs. Mandrakis ? &nbsp; MANDRAKISShe is. . . unable to have any more children . &nbsp; CLIFFORDI 'm sorry . Please give her my best . &nbsp; MANDRAKISOf course . Clifford turns to go .  --  28  --  18 INT . MANSION - STAIRCASE &amp; ENTRANCE HALL As Clifford finds his own way down the stairs and out the front door . A WOMAN watches Clifford leave from the back of the staircase . It is Mrs. Mandrakis . As with her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a brooding , barren woman . O.S. the front door closes . Clifford is gone . Mrs. Mandrakis walks around the front of the stairs and begins slowly ascending them . The houseboy silently steps into the entrance hall from a side door and watches her . CUT TO : Section Details 19 INT . A HALLWAY - MENTAL INSTITUTION - DAY A male PATIENT wearing green , institutional pajamas and slippers shuffles slowly up the hall . His movement is catatonic , unfocused . Canned Musak faintly underscores the scene . &nbsp; MAN 'S VOICE ( O.S. ) Curt Duncan is n't going to run right out and kill more children . I 'm not worried about that . ANGLE ON CLIFFORD Standing in the doorway of an office , facing into the hall , watching the patient . &nbsp; MAN 'S VOICE ( O.S.-CONT 'D ) We had him for six years . . . under continuous therapy , some of it rather forceful . . .

ANGLE ON CLIFFORD He turns and goes back into the office . 20 INT . OFFICE - DAY We see now the MAN who 's been talking - the director of the State Hospital , DR . MONK . He is sitting comfortably behind his desk ; his jacket off , his tie loosened , his feet up on the desk . He is very matter-of-fact . &nbsp; DR . MONKEventually , anyone will respond to the treatment here . Clifford sits down in front of the desk , picks up a folder and leafs through it . &nbsp; CLIFFORDYou gave him electric shock ? &nbsp; DR . MONKYeah , we zapped him a few times . It 's fairly standard . &nbsp; CLIFFORDIt says here thirty-eight . . . thirty-eight times . Monk shrugs , then yawns expansively . He need n't justify himself to the layman . &nbsp; CLIFFORD ( CONT 'D ) What will happen to him now , without the drugs he was on ? DR . MONK 'S SECRETARY enters the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his lines , Monk takes the folder , opens it , initials something on the inside , closes the folder and hands it back to the secretary who turns and leaves the office without uttering a word . &nbsp; DR . MONKThere 'll be some deterioration . That 's inevitable , but we ca n't say how much . Pause . Clifford looks at the doctor as if questioning his casual assessment of " some deterioration . " &nbsp; CLIFFORDDuring the time that you had him here , did you discover any particular habits of his , peculiarities , quirks , anything that might help me find him ?  --  30  --  &nbsp; DR . MONK ( shrugging again ) It 's all in the folder . &nbsp; CLIFFORDAny letters from people back in England ? Family ? &nbsp; DR . MONKThat , too , is in the folder . Clifford directs a bleak look back down at the open folder , then looks up again , his eyes narrowing . &nbsp; CLIFFORDLet 's get something straight here , Doctor . I 've been 33 years in the business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost a year on Curt Duncan alone , with the trial , the testimonies , the background investigations . I did n't come here today to look in your goddamn folders . In fact , I would n't have come here at all if you 'd done your job right . Pause . &nbsp; DR . MONKMr . Clifford , this is a hospital , not a penitentiary . Everything that pertains to one of our patients is meticulously recorded in that patient 's folder . . . whether you can make sense of it or not . They glare at each other for several seconds . Monk is the first one to look away . Curt Duncan is a classic paranoid-schizophrenic . They see themselves as victims , and they always blame other people for the way they are . When Duncan killed the Mandrakis kids , it was n't an act of hostility against the children but against  --  31  --  their parents . He was getting back at his own parents for traumas he suffered in early childhood .

MONKI think you 'll find him . Somebody will find him . He ca n't function out there . He 'll make a mistake . ( turning to face Clifford ) This is where he belongs . After six years in here , he 's suddenly gone out to confront the world again . I think he 's in for a bit of a shock . Monk looks back out the window . CUT TO : Section Details 21 EXT . CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON Not a terribly good section of town . We are looking at the nondescript exterior of a bar across the street . 22 INT . BAR This is not a slum bar , but it 's close . There are a few tables and chairs and a pool table in the back . The atmosphere is quiet , almost depressed , and the handful of REGULARS here are exercising their privacy without having to be alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner , who absently polishes things with his cloth ; TRACY , an unemployed woman in her mid-forties who sits at the bar with a drink and  --  32  --  a cigarette and silently rummages through her current feelings  --  none of them new or particularly hopeful ; a COUPLE , probably retired , sitting at the same table they come to every afternoon at this time  --  him for his beer , her for a glass of sweet white wine ; and BILL , at the pool table , a young man lithe and powerful , minding his own business and playing his game of pool with a steady , aggressive concentration . &nbsp; RETIRED MANRackin ' ' em up today , Bill ? Pause . &nbsp; BILL ( over his shoulder ) Doin ' all right . The old man smiles stupidly around the room . He racked ' em up a little in his day , too . His smile fades as he looks at his wife . He takes a sip of beer and lapses into memories . Then the door opens to the outside and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The regulars turn to glimpse who 's coming in . They see the figure of a MAN silhouetted in the doorway . He stands there for a long moment , not coming in . Finally even Bill interrupts his game to turn and look . &nbsp; HANKC'mon in and shut the door . The intruder enters , indecisively . The door swings shut behind him , plunging the room back into darkness . This man is " a little weird " , and the regulars continue to stare at him until he makes his way to a table near the wall and sits down . Then everyone returns to his own thoughts . &nbsp; HANK ( after a moment ) What 'll it be ? ( pause , no answer ) Hey ! What 'll it be ? CLOSEUP- INTRUDER A bit startled , a bit defensive toward the directness of this question . It is Curt Duncan . He looks understandably harried . He has n't slept or shaved in at least a couple of days , and is wearing regular clothing .  --  33  --  He clears his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What kind of clothes was he wearing . . . when he escaped ? CUT TO : Section Details 23 INT . DR . MONK 'S OFFICE - DAY Clifford is looking through the folder again . &nbsp; DR . MONKOrdinary street clothes . Not all of our patients have to wear the green Gucci gowns . &nbsp; CLIFFORDDid he have any money with him ? &nbsp; DR . MONKProbably . But not more than , say , fifty dollars . Some of the patients are given little jobs around the ward , for which they are paid . It 's part of the rehabilitation . Looking down , Clifford pauses over a page in the folder . CLOSEUP - FACT SHEET IN FOLDER A page of legibly organized facts and statistics about Curt Duncan . One of the entries reads : Guy du Marraux . &nbsp; CLIFFORD ( O.S. ) ( reading ) What 's Guy du Mar --  &nbsp; DR . MONK ( O.S. ) ( pronouncing it correctly ) Guy du Marraux syndrom . BACK TO SCENE &nbsp; DR . MONKIt 's a psycho-motor dysfunction.  --  34  --  &nbsp; CLIFFORDDuncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , which is unusual . &nbsp; CLIFFORDWhat is it ? &nbsp; DR . MONKIt attacks the nervous system . People suffering from it are irresistibly compelled to utter obscenities , sometimes one , sometimes a whole string of them . They ca n't control it . &nbsp; CLIFFORD ( somewhat taken aback ) Are you being serious ? &nbsp; DR . MONKYeah . Here , I 'll give you an example . He opens a file cabinet drawer , finds a reel of quarter-inch magnetic tape and starts to thread it through a recorder on his desk . &nbsp; DR . MONK ( CONT 'D ) Duncan never had the twitch that sometimes goes with it . And with Duncan , as I said , the disease would only manifest itself in periods of extreme anxiety . When he was really flipping out , in other words . There is a pause as Monk fiddles with the tape recorder and Clifford looks back down at the folder . &nbsp; CLIFFORDDuncan was Catholic ? &nbsp; DR . MONKYeah. ( beat ) So am I.  --  35  --  &nbsp; CLIFFORD ( mildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MONKIs that right ? So we all share the same guilt . Clifford smiles . Monk keeps fiddling . &nbsp; DR . MONK ( CONT 'D ) Here . This is Curt Duncan shortly after he was admitted here in 1972 . Monk turns on the tape recorder as Clifford sits forward in his chair to listen . At first , nothing can be heard . Then there is a click as if the machine was turned on in the middle of a conversation : &nbsp; DR . MONK ( O.S. )  --  to put the situation right . The hypodermic needles are only used to give you medication that will calm you down . They make you feel good , relaxed . All right ? ( no answer ) We 're not putting anything in your food either . The food is just food . &nbsp; DUNCAN ( O.S. ) ( extremely agitated ) No . I do n't eat the food . It does n't taste right . &nbsp; DR . MONK ( to Clifford ) That 's Duncan . Clifford nods and keeps listening : &nbsp; DR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fidgeting ? Ca n't you get comfortable ? &nbsp; DUNCAN ( O.S. ) No , I 'm not comfortable !  --  36  --  &nbsp; DR . MONK ( O.S. ) Wait a  --  Hey ! ( to someone else ) Hold him down there . Grab him ! Never mind the chair ! There are scuffling noises underneath which can be heard , heavy breathing and then , getting louder and more furious , Duncan falling into the throes of Guy du Marraux . &nbsp; DR . MONK ( O.S. ) ( periodically interjecting ) Pull him down . . . That 's right . . . Just lay him out . . . Lay him right out . . . Steady . . . Pull out his knees . . . Finally Monk is heard no more and Duncan continues with the frightening verbal torrent of Guy du Marraux . DISSOLVE TO : Section Details 24 INT . BAR - LATE AFTERNOON - CLOSEUP - DUNCAN Sitting at his table inside the bar . He takes a long , noisy drink from what looks like a bourbon on the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's had in over six years . But Duncan can not relax enough to enjoy it fully . His eyes are ever restlessly , suspiciously moving about . ANGLE ON BAR As Bill walks up and stands next to Tracy . Hank moves off to get Bill another beer . Tracy looks up at Bill and smiles . As regulars at the same bar , they are loose and comfortable with each other . &nbsp; TRACY ( sotto voce ) A little action for your game ? &nbsp; BILL ( sotto voce ) What , him ? They both turn and look across the room at Duncan . POV - DUNCAN As Bill and Tracy look straight at him over their shoulders and then turn back . ANGLE ON BAR As they both smile at her joke . &nbsp; TRACYI would n't bet against you . &nbsp; BILLWhat 's the matter ? You do n't like me playing with myself ? Tracy grimaces as Hank comes back with Bill 's beer . Bill picks up the bottle , nods his thanks to Hank and heads back to the pool table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow Bill to the pool table , then come back to Tracy at the bar . POV - DUNCAN Looking at the back of Tracy . She reaches into her purse . ON TRACY She takes her pack of cigarettes from the purse . She pulls out a cigarette , taps it lightly on the bar , puts it to her lips . O.S. we hear the sound of a match being struck . WIDER ANGLE Duncan is standing beside her holding a lit match . He shoves it forward at her . It goes out . Duncan fumbles for another match as Tracy regards him with undisguised repulsion . Duncan gets the second match lit and holds it out for her . She accepts the favor and lights her cigarette .  --  38  --  Duncan smiles . Tracy nods and turns away . Duncan is still holding the burning match for her to blow out . As it does n't look like she 's going to , he lets it drop , still lit , to the floor .  --  38  --  REACTION SHOT - BARTENDER He gives a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuckin ' weirdo " . TWO SHOT - DUNCAN AND TRACY Pause . Duncan is still smiling at her . &nbsp; DUNCANHi . No response . &nbsp; DUNCAN ( CONT 'D ) What you been up to ? &nbsp; TRACY ( looking at him ) My own business . ( beat ) Thanks for the light . Okay ? The Englishman sits down beside her , but does n't look at her . Tracy looks away too , determined to ignore him , not to let him get into her space . Duncan coughs . After a long moment , he turns back to her . &nbsp; DUNCANNext round 's on me . Tracy keeps her eyes straight ahead , acknowledging nothing . Pause . Duncan takes some money from his pocket and lays it on the bar , staring at her . Tracy turns to him : &nbsp; TRACY ( annoyed ) Listen , mister , I 've got my own money . So , if you do n't mind . . .  --  39  --  She looks away again . Pause . &nbsp; DUNCANAfter what I been through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUNCAN ( CONT 'D ) See , that 's the whole point . My mind . . . Your mind . . . Where do they fit in ? You know what I mean ? Tracy abruptly picks up her purse and moves down the bar away from him one seat , then another seat . ANGLE ON ELDERLY COUPLE They are watching this little spectacle with growing curiosity . ANGLE ON DUNCAN Still looking at her . By pointing at what she has , he orders two more drinks from the Bartender . When they arrive , he takes a big swallow from one , picks up the other , stands , moves down the bar and sits beside Tracy again . &nbsp; DUNCAN ( setting her drink before her ) Do you live around here ? &nbsp; TRACYGet offa me ! ! REACTION SHOTS Even Bill now looks up from the pool table . His expression darkens . ANGLE ON BAR Tracy has clammed up  --  her elbows on the bar , head between  --  40  --  her elbows , arms covering her ears , hands clasped behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk again : &nbsp; DUNCAN ( rapidly ) Listen , I did n't mean nothin ' . I do n't live around here . See  --  ? &nbsp; BILL ( O.S. ) I think the lady wants to be left alone . Duncan looks up . Bill enters the frame and stands in front of Tracy , confronting Duncan . CLOSEUP - DUNCAN Looking up at Bill , his eyes red , his gaze unsteady . WIDER ANGLE The air is charged with tension . &nbsp; BILLI think an apology is in order . Duncan does n't know how to handle this . He looks at Bill , half shrugs , half smiles . &nbsp; BILL ( CONT 'D ) That the best you can do ? Duncan looks away . A long moment passes . &nbsp; BILL ( CONT 'D ) I think you 'd better just move along , pal . Duncan does n't move , says nothing . He swallows hard . &nbsp; HANKHe 'll be okay now , Bill . He just  --  &nbsp; BILLNo ! I want him out of here !  --  41  --  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tracy gets up from her seat and cautiously moves even further down the bar . &nbsp; BILL ( CONT 'D ) ( to Duncan ) Go on , beat it . They glare at each other . The longer Duncan sits there without moving , without saying anything , the angrier Bill gets . REACTION SHOTS As the tension builds . ANGLE ON BAR Duncan looks away . &nbsp; BILL ( CONT 'D ) I 'm not going to say it again , mister . Duncan reaches for his drink , but Bill reacts quicker . With a swipe of his hand , he knocks the glass off the bar , and it shatters on the floor behind the bar . Duncan sits there , stunned , not looking up . After a long moment , Duncan coughs . Then he turns and looks at Bill . He purses his lips . It looks like a nervous facial movement . Then suddenly , Duncan spits at Bill , hitting him square in the face . Before anyone can register what 's happened , Bill lunges at Duncan , knocking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight is fast , vicious and one-sided from the very start . Pinned to the floor on his back , Duncan flails his arms ineffectually like a panicked insect as Bill holds him in place with a left-handed grip on the collar while his powerful right arm , pumping up and down like a piston , pounds into Duncan 's face time and time again . Duncan 's screams diminish into pathetic , sickening groans and the others in the bar are compelled to avert their eyes from this brutal spectacle .  --  42  --  Hank has picked up a phone from beneath the bar and is dialing a number . He turns away from the fight to talk . Then , as suddenly as Bill first sprang at Duncan , he leaps to his feet and turns to the bar . He reaches over and grabs the phone from Hank , slamming it down into the cradle . &nbsp; BILLWho 're you calling ? Bill takes the cloth from the bar and vigorously wipes his face off . He snaps his fingers and points to a row of bottles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle . Bill pours himself a shot and downs it , fast . He is still charged with adrenalin and he takes two more shots in rapid succession , spilling the alcohol on the bar and on himself . As Bill picks up the cloth to wipe himself off again , Tracy stands up and quickly walks out of the bar , slamming the door behind her . &nbsp; BILL ( calling after her ) You 're welcome , baby ! Then he throws down the cloth , picks up the bottle , turns and , standing over Duncan 's inert form , empties half the bottle onto him . He sets the bottle back on the bar . He grabs Duncan and , half dragging , hurries him out the back door and throws him into the alley where Duncan falls in a heap . Bill storms back up to the bar and pours himself another drink . &nbsp; BILL ( to Hank ) Okay ? Hank just looks at him , does n't answer . At the wife 's silent insistence , the elderly couple stand up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh , Bill ? Bill does n't answer and the couple quietly leave .  --  43  --  &nbsp; HANK ( apologetic ) A fight breaks out , there 's gon na be damages . Insurance company does n't pay without a police report . . . &nbsp; BILLYou see any damages ? Hank lowers his gaze to the floor . Bill finishes his drink . He is still very hopped up . He pulls a few dollars from his wallet and drops them on the counter . &nbsp; BILL ( CONT 'D ) See ya ' round . He turns and strides out of the bar . CAMERA HOLDS for a beat on Hank alone now in his empty establishment . The phone starts to ring , presumably the police calling back . After several rings , Hank picks up the phone and listens . &nbsp; HANK ( into phone ) No , it 's over now . . . DISSOLVE TO : pp. 1-24 &nbsp; pp. 44-62 25 INT . LT .

Then the door swings open and the shadowy figure of a MAN crosses the threshold . He stops just inside . &nbsp; MAN ( calling out ) Donna . Donna ! Hey ! ( under his breath ) What the hell  --  ! Suddenly the lights come on and a chorus of voices cry out , " SURPRISE ! "  --  44  --  A broad smile breaks across the man 's face . We may recognize him as the cop from six years ago - Charles Garber . Today he is a lieutenant on the force and dresses casually for work , usually in slacks , turtleneck and jacket . &nbsp; GARBER ( genuinely surprised ) What is all this ? ! &nbsp; SCATTERED VOICESHappy birthday , Charlie ! Garber looks sheepishly at his hand holding the pistol he 'd drawn just before the lights came up . &nbsp; WOMAN 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , Charlie ! &nbsp; GARBER ( chagrined ) How was I supposed to know ? Everybody starts to laugh , including Garber as he returns the pistol to his shoulder holster . ANGLE ON DONNA Garber 's wife . She comes out of the kitchen carrying a birthday cake with lit candles and makes her way through the crowd of GUESTS singing " Happy Birthday " . Everyone joins in as Donna moves forward and stands beside her husband . Clifford is one of the guests . He has his arm around a young BLOND who is sort of pretty despite her tacky/plastic appearance . When the song is over , Garber blows out the candles and hugs and kisses his wife . Everybody cheers . CUT TO : 26 INT . GARBER 'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - SEVERAL HOURS LATER The party is still in full swing . Garber is following Clifford up the stairs .

I want you to remember this in the morning . &nbsp; GARBERIf you want me to remember something in the morning , then tell it to me in the morning . Garber half comically turns to go . Clifford stops him . &nbsp; CLIFFORDCharlie , come on . ANGLE ON CORNER OF BEDROOM A BABY between a year and two years old is lying in a crib . It opens its eyes and starts looking around . &nbsp; GARBER ( O.S. ) All right , all right . What is it ? You 're getting married .  --  46  --  &nbsp; CLIFFORDNo .

CLOSEUP - DUNCAN He is standing in shadows across the street , watching her . 29 EXT . TRACY ON STREET - NIGHT A series of shots of Tracy walking home . The CAMERA remains consistently behind her or off to one side , sometimes DOLLYING with her behind a row of parked cars , sometimes picking up her passing reflection in a darkened store window . The impression this gives is unmistakable . Curt Duncan is following her . We do not see him , we do not hear him , yet we know he is there . Often we can sense that the very angle from which we see Tracy is his POV . But Tracy is aware of nothing . We know this when the CAMERA begins to move in front of her , once more becoming an impersonal observer of her walk homeward , to safety . Tension mounts as we start to expect that Duncan will jump out at her from every alley and recessed doorway she passes .

At regular intervals , tiny shafts of light pierce the darkness from on high . There is no sign of Duncan , but Clifford knows he must be in here , hiding somewhere . He slowly walks forward to the front of the chancel . &nbsp; CLIFFORDDuncan . Duncan . It 's over now . Come on out . Pause . Duncan does n't come out . Clifford holds very still . He hears nothing .

A rope hangs down from the bells , dangling all the way down the shaft , forty or fifty feet to the floor of the church . Clifford is bounding up the last flight of steps to get him . Duncan has little choice . He is trapped . Just before Clifford reaches him , Duncan leaps out into the shaft and catches the bell rope . The bell starts to clang as Duncan , hanging in mid air , swings back and forth within the narrow shaft . Clifford leans way out through the lancet window and takes a swipe  --  80  --  at Duncan , but the madman is just beyond his reach and hurriedly climbing down the rope . Clifford reaches out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets it , and he shakes it violently to get Duncan to lose his grip and be dashed against the stone floor below . But Duncan holds firm , climbing ever downward . The bell continues to clang , sending its alarm out into the night . Then Clifford braces himself and slowly , laboriously begins to haul up on the rope . Clifford gains momentum until Duncan is being pulled up faster than he is climbing down . Still twenty feet off the ground , Duncan lets go of the rope and plummets to the hard stone floor . Then PEOPLE come rushing into the church , awakened by the commotion of the bells . Duncan rolls into the shadows and drags himself out a side door , while Clifford plans his own escape from the bell tower . CUT TO : 83 EXT .
