As idle miners in Appalachia and elsewhere picked over the tentative coal settlement last week , formal deliberations ran into deep trouble in Washington . The bargaining council of the United Mine Workers voted by 38 to 1 to send the pact back to negotiators for more-much more . Already the settlement calls for wage-and-benefit increases exceeding 50% over three years . But council members sought a bigger pay raise next year than the negotiated 9% , as well as the right to strike over local issues . They also wanted a reinstatement of the traditional two-week vacation period , which had been split into single weeks . <P> Surprised by the council 's obstinacy , U.M.W. President Arnold Miller traveled home to the coal fields of West Virginia to drum up support for the agreement . He announced that he will seek no further basic concessions from the Bituminous Coal Operators Association - only revisions in language . Said Miller : " I 'm not going back for another bite of the apple . All that 's left is the core . " <P> The delay will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the 120,000 U.M.W. members for ratification , which should take eight to ten days . As a result , the strike , now in its third week , will probably drag into a fifth or even sixth . A prolonged strike could cause layoffs in coal-dependent industries to multiply rapidly and could send the unemployment rate later this year above 6.5%-a figure that Administration planners had not expected to be reached until next year . Layoffs related to the coal strike last week totaled nearly 20,000 . At U.S. Steel , 18,000 employees were out of work or put on short weeks because of the mine stoppage . Bethlehem Steel will lay off 2,800 workers this week . The Illinois Central Gulf Railroad and Norfolk &; Western Railway Co. have laid off a total of 770 employees . <P> Meanwhile , strike fever seems to be spreading . Some 16,000 members of the Amalgamated Transit Union last week struck Greyhound bus lines . The union seeks an increase of 600 an hour above the current average wage of $5.76 . Many of Greyhound 's passengers were left stranded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Thanksgiving found it hard to find space on crowded trains , planes , and nonstriking bus lines . <P> The only bright spot was an end to the 85-day walkout by United Parcel Service workers in the New York City area . The settlement means that UPS 's 4,500 drivers and inside workers will earn $7.59 an hour after three years , compared with their current pay of $5.92 . They also won a cost-of-living escalator and fringes that will lift their wage-and-benefit package by some 30%.
