That juicy 14-game Red Sox lead browned out <P> The crash was all the more humiliating , after the dizzying descent , because it came before their adoring fans , who came to cheer and stayed to boo . In Fenway Park , their beloved tiny gem of a stadium , the Boston Red Sox did the unthinkable : they lost four straight to the New York Yankees , their hated rivals , whiffing the breeze with their bats and booting grounders like soccer players . The tragedy had been unfolding for weeks , painfully , inexorably , the most fascinating horror story of the major leagues this year . The Red Sox had a 14-game lead over the Yankees just two months ago ; and not since the Boston Braves of 1914 overtook the New York Giants had such a lead so late in the season been blown . The Red Sox had led the division from late May until last week ; but as Yankee Star Reggie Jackson said , " It 's where you are when the leaves turn brown , not when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the end is a short two-week pennant race away . <P> Boston deserves better , and could , of course , still get it . The city is an old-fashioned baseball town , of the ilk of St. Louis , of old Brooklyn . The love affair is fostered by eccentric Fenway Park . The seats so embrace the field that the fans literally feel the joy and agony of each play . The fans come in all shapes and classes . They talk about the same plays on assembly lines , in shipyards , at academic meetings , during black-tie dinners on Beacon Hill , and at the stately clubs . Yale President A. Bartlett Giamatti wears a Sox cap . Humberto Cardinal Medeiros asked how they were doing just before the papal conclave . Senator Edward Kennedy upon his return from Moscow discussed with House Speaker Tip O'Neill the Yankees ' four-game " Boston Massacre , " an event that the Boston Globe 's Washington bureau chief , Martin Nolan , called a " tracheotomy of the soul . " Explains an M.I.T. psychology professor : " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champions . " <P> But not , alas , champions of much else . The last World Series they won was in 1918 . They have won the pennant three times since World War II , only to lose the Series in seven games , and been run-ners-up five times . <P> This year the stumbling started at the All-Star break , when the Red Sox were 57-26 . In a decline fueled by injuries , they since then have played below .500 ball . In early July , Shortstop Rick Burleson hurt his ankle and missed 18 games , twelve of which the team lost . The Sox doyen . Carl Yastrzemski. injured his nagging back , then his shoulder , then his wrist . Pepper-Pot Second Baseman Jerry Remy fractured his wrist last month , and is still playing with it taped . Dwight Evans was hit by a pitch and gets dizzy chasing fly balls . Add to that Catcher Carlton Fisk 's broken rib , First Baseman George Scott 's battered right middle finger . Third Baseman Butch Hobson 's injured elbow and Centerfielder Fred Lynn 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be better off playing softball for Massachusetts General Hospital . Only this season 's sensation , Jim Rice , has remained healthy .
