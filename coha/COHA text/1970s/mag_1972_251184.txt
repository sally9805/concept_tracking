" Our players seem to be able to do whatever is necessary , " says Los Angeles Laker Coach Bill Sharman . Those words may well qualify as the classic understatement of the 1971 sports season . <P> Not content merely to set a new National Basketball Association record with 21 consecutive wins ( TIME , Dec. 27 ) , the Lakers have since done dramatically more than is necessary . When the Philadelphia 76ers threatened them with a 132-point outburst , the Lakers countered with 154 , setting a new N.B.A. high for the season . Then they outscored the Baltimore Bullets 34 to 18 in one quarter , to win their 27th game in a row , breaking a U.S. major-league sports mark set by baseball 's New York Giants in 1916 . Last week the Lakers won three more games , to run their unbeaten streak to 30 . <P> What is the Lakers ' secret ? Guard Jerry West says that it is not the $5 bonus that Sharman doles out for each blocked shot or ball-stealing play . " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose Laker salary is a reported $200,000 a year . " But whatever it is , we like it . " Sharman knows exactly what it is , and he has printed the answer on the dressing room blackboard in large letters : RUN . The fast-breaking Lakers have read the word and reacted by outhustling all comers . <P> With half the season still to go , Sharman has no doubt that the going will get tougher . Noting that the 1916 Giants set their record while playing at home , he explains that " it 's harder to sustain a winning streak in basketball . We have tougher travel conditions and have to fight the other teams ' home court advantage , which does n't mean as much in baseball . " That argument does not impress Laker Center Wilt Chamberlain , who remembers his days with the Harlem Globetrotters ' traveling basketball show . " I played with them when they won all their games , " he says , " and they were all on the road . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
