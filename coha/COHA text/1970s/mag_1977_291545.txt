If we do not win in Florida , the effect on the balance of the states will be terrible . <P> - Midge Costanza , women 's rights assistant to President Carter <P> Supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment had long counted on Florida as one of the last three states needed to ratify the amendment . But they were in for a rude shock . Last week , after an emotional four-hour session , the Florida senate voted , 21-19 , to defeat the ERA . Said a stunned ERA advocate : " I hope to God it is n't over . " <P> But it just may be . Despite a promising start ( in which 33 states ratified the amendment within three years after it was passed by the U.S. Senate in 1972 ) , just two states-North Dakota and Indiana-have approved the amendment since February 1975 . Only 38 are needed to make the ERA the 27th Amendment to the Constitution . But strong opposition exists in the remaining 15 states , and less than two years remains until March 22 , 1979-the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states . <P> Homemade Bread . A major reason for the faltering pace of the ERA drive is the mixed reaction from those who might be expected to give strong support to an amendment guaranteeing the equality of women : females . A 1976 poll showed that while 59% of adult males supported the ERA , only 55% of the women favored it . The division among women has made it easier for state legislators , many of whom are older , conservative males , to vote their predilections-or , as one battle-weary activist put it , " their instincts . " Some 62% of Florida voters favored the ERA , according to a survey by Jimmy Carter 's pollster , Pat Caddell ; yet even that margin was not sufficient to sway enough members of Florida 's senate . Like legislators elsewhere , some were impressed more by the viewpoint espoused in the road-show tactics of Phyllis Schlafly , an Alton , Ill. , housewife and an active Republican , who wrote the right-wing treatise on Barry Goldwater 's 1964 presidential candidacy , A Choice Not an Echo . Wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERA " brigades have descended on legislators , bearing gifts of homemade bread " from the breadmakers to the breadwinners . " Says Schlafly : " Women already enjoy superior rights . " Her followers agree so strongly that they announced a boycott of Girl Scout cookies after the national Girl Scout organization endorsed the ERA earlier this year . ERA supporters have attempted to counter the Schlafly crusade by sending their own homemade cakes to the legislators . <P> But the most effective tactic of the opponents is the misleading rhetoric that they have used to cloud the issues . The 52 words of the amendment add up to a simple statement that equality of rights shall not be denied by government on the basis of sex . But in Florida , as elsewhere , opponents claimed that the ERA would force the legalization of homosexual marriage , end the support of wives by their husbands , and require use of the same public toilets by men and women . With scant effect , legal experts insist that the ERA requires none of these measures .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
