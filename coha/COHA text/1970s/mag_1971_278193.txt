Question : Who is Harry Kellerman and why is he saying those terrible things about me ? <P> Answer : Harry Kellerman is the villain of a mystery-comedy . The questioner in the coy , interminable title of this film is Georgie Soloway ( Dustin Hoffman ) . The mystery is why it should be called a comedy . <P> Hovering miserably around 40 , Rock Composer Soloway has a score of gold platters , his picture on the cover of TIME , an airplane and a triplex atop Manhattan 's General Motors building . But like something is missing . Truth , maybe . Or beauty . Whatever it is , girls start refusing his sack and his own psychiatrist ( Jack Warden ) muses , " Mr. Soloway , we must not rule out the possibility that you are a bird-a loony bird . " <P> And a familiar one . In A Thousand Clowns , Scenarist Herb Gardner created Murray Burns , the same avian specimen ostentatiously hiding his self-pity in a cloak of jokes . Georgie is a blurred replica of Murray , surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lame insights : " Time is not a thief ; he 's an embezzler , juggling the books at night so you do n't notice anything 's missing . " <P> Like many rock concerts , Harry Kellerman has about 15 minutes of entertainment and hours to kill . Accordingly , Director Ulu Grosbard shot endless footage of the sidewalks of New York City , a view of the city from the air , and Georgie and his shrink schussing downhill in the snow . The pictorial trickery can not disguise the vapidity of the film . <P> Now and then a few bits gleam . Hoffman 's sluggish nasal metabolism is still amusing if familiar ; Barbara Harris has a few moving moments as an auditioning singer with only three good notes ; and the late David Burns is the archetypal Jewish father who seems to have sired every writer from Philip Roth to Erich Segal . But that troupe would be funny reading subway signs . Maybe more so .
