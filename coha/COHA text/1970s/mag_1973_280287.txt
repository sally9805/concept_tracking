It was late in a long day , and Connecticut Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. , the junior man on the Ervin committee , was just beginning his second go-round with Star Witness Dean . Weicker , the committee 's rebellious Republican and sole representative from the northern half of the country , proved once more to have little flair for interrogation-in fact , he virtually gave up any pretense of questioning Dean shortly after he had started his address . <P> He began by reciting a veritable litany of " illegal , unconstitutional and gross " acts performed by the Executive branch since the beginning of the 1972 campaign . Then he came to his main point : that the Administration had done its level best to subvert the Ervin committee hearings as recently as this April , even while announcing publicly its intention of cooperating fully . <P> As proof , he read a transcript of a March 28 telephone conversation between John Ehrlichman , Nixon 's former aide ( who taped it ) , and then Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst , <P> in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we 've got to take him on . " <P> Partisan Comment . Weicker then went on to outline the Administration 's efforts . On April 10 , Weicker announced , he had learned that the White House had tried to establish that funds for his 1970 Senate campaign had been improperly reported . Although no such illegal funding was discovered , Weicker learned some time later that Charles W. <P> Colson , the ubiquitous former White House aide , had spoken to a reporter not only about such " illegal " funds , but also about Weicker 's being a " disloyal " Republican . Weicker announced that he had asked Special Watergate Prosecutor Archibald Cox to investigate the matter . <P> In response to Weicker 's remarks . <P> Dean observed that similar attempts had been made to undermine him . <P> Reading the riot act to the White House , Weicker declared : " Whether it is you Dean in that witness chair or whether it is me in this committee chair or any other man in back of this table or any other witness who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be no more threats , no intimidation , no innuendo , no working through the press to destroy the credibility of individuals . " <P> For his finale , Weicker gave what he called " my partisan comment . " Far from being ready to switch parties , Weicker said , " I think I express the feelings of the 42 other Republican Senators that I work with , and the Republicans of the state of Connecticut , and in fact the Republican Party , far better than these illegal , unconstitutional and gross acts which have been committed over the past several months by various individuals . " Republicans , Weicker insisted , do not cover up , do not threaten , do not commit illegal acts and , " God knows . Republicans do n't view their fellow Americans as enemies to be harassed " but rather as " human beings to be loved and won . " For a few brief seconds , the room was stone silent . Then the gallery broke into the loudest and longest applause of the proceedings , drowning out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into the details of the White House campaign that had triggered his outburst , TIME has learned that it began in March , when H.R. Haldeman 's assistant , Larry Higby , called Presidential
