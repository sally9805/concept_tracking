As part of our Bicentennial observances TIME asked leaders of nations round the world to address the American people through the pages of TIME on how they view the U.S. and what they hope , and expect , from the nation in the years ahead . This message from Tanzania 's President Julius K. Nyerere is the fourth in a series . <P> America is a society whose faults are the more glaring because of its admirable openness , because of the principles on which the nation was founded and because of the power which comes from its wealth and its size . It is an inspiration , and a warning , to the world . Poor nations aspire to emulate it , or else they fear it-and sometimes both . <P> For America is judged by the standards set out in imperishable language in the Declaration of Independence of 1776-which is one of the greatest documents of all time . And America now has a degree of wealth and power which could enable the ideals of its founding fathers to be translated into reality . It should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a society which gives to all its citizens equal freedom and security and equal rights and responsibilities . Certainly , it should now be possible for America to " observe good faith and justice toward all nations " without having to fear for its own independence . <P> The continual struggle of Americans for the implementation of these principles within America , regardless of race or economic status , is a matter of history and contemporary politics . Much progress has been made over the past 200 years . In particular the Federal Government is now committed to fighting racial discrimination within the U.S. by laws , administrative acts and education . This we recognize ; it is vital to the respect accorded to America . <P> But the gap between the principles and the potential on the one hand and the reality on the other is still frighteningly wide , even within America . Americans of non-European descent are still having to struggle to achieve for themselves their full rights as American citizens , equal with all others . Extreme poverty , and even hunger , exist among a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost a breakdown of many of the public and communal services which are vital to civilized life and in respect of which we would expect America to be an example to the rest of struggling humanity . <P> So countries like mine look at America in its Bicentennial year with admiration and respect , yet a feeling of disappointment for opportunities lost . But we also look at America with fear because of the use to which America 's great power is often put , and the extent to which American principles have been flouted in the international exercise of American power . <P> Americans fought a war for their independence . They fought a civil war to maintain their unity despite the diverse social and cultural origins of Americans . The poor and oppressed of the world therefore expect Americans to understand and support the struggles of other peoples to be free and united , even if freedom and unity can not be won peacefully . We expect that America will be the last nation , not the first , to try to thwart , pervert or destroy the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
