txt Letters : ' He Saved Vienna 's Ferris Wheel ' ELLIE MULLER-STEINEROTTO F. REISSROBERT J. JONESEVA ROTHTHOMAS G. MORGENSENJO ... Letters : ' He Saved Vienna 's Ferris Wheel ' To the Editor : I read with interest your article " A Young Stranger Returns to Vienna " ( Travel Section , May 25 ) , but what made the article about a girl named Vienna Steiner even more remarkable to me was the coincidence of her last name and the history of the " Riesenrad , " Prater 's Ferris wheel in Vienna . It was my father Edward Steiner ( no relation to Vienna Steiner ) who purchased the Ferris wheel as a daring bet and a practical joke with a happy ending . While traveling through Europe on business during the First World War ( he was born and lived in Czechoslovakia ) , he was told that the Ferris wheel was in such abominable shape that the City of Vienna was considering scrapping it . Since building material was in short supply , my father sought to purchase it for scrap iron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in operating condition and make it a financial success . He took them up on it , restored it and made it operational and that is how Vienna 's landmark came to be preserved and that is why it still exists today . My father died during the Second World War in a concentration camp ; and for a while we thought the Russians might confiscate the " Riesenrad " on their march west . Quite unexpectedly , though , it was turned over to me and my sister , but I have sold my share since . My sister died , but her children still retain two-thirds of its ownership . ELLIE MULLER-STEINER Vineland , N. J. To the Editor : Thank you for at last coming up with a writer who knows that fogosch , the delectable fish , is pike in English , Hecht in German ( and , I might add , brochet on a French menu ) . Many writers are under the false impression that fogosch , a Hungarian word , designates something called " Danube trout . " I 'm happy that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been laid to rest . Alan Levy knows Vienna . He wrote a delightful article . OTTO F. REISS New York BEN FRANKLIN TOUR To the Editor : I was interested in the story , " A Ben Franklin Tour With Ben Franklin " ( Travel Section , June 1 ) , particularly the part about the abortive peace confer ... once at the Billopp House on Staten Island . During the 1930 's and 1940 's , when I was co-owner of a weekly paper on Staten Island , the house was supported by a loyal group known as the Conference House Association . In exchange for free rent , a young couple served as caretakers and the husband occasionally filled in as a substitute in my poker club . One cold winter night we played our biweekly game in the large basement room heated by the massive fireplace where Col. Billopp 's meals had been cooked . And our beer was kept cool in a tunnel which , according to legend , ran down to the shore facing Perth Amboy . Although the place was supposedly haunted , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " UNCLE MAX " To the Editor : The article , " Where Music Sounds , " ( Travel Section , June 1 ) , distressed me and filled me with bitter-sweet memories at the same time . The age of supertourism has spawned kitsch like the " Sound of Music " bus all over the globe and has ruined practically everything that used to be beautiful . I consider myself quite well-versed in the intricacies of Schloss Leopoldskron , being a niece of Max Reinhardt and having spent most of my childhood summers in Salzburg , so I must take exception to the statement that guests were ferried to the castle by gondoliers and torchbearers . The tour guide 's sense of the Graustarkian apparently carried him too far . There definitely were no torchbearers nor gondoliers roaming around the lake , the woods and the park . Leopoldskron had a regular entrance . After an elaborate wrought-iron gate was opened  --  let 's say by a flunky ? cars were driven to the front door of the castle where the illustrious passengers did their disembarking . EvA ROTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a Georgia native assigned to guide an Austrian tour . Among other matters , he alluded to " a well-known movie director of whom some of you may have heard . " Max Reinhardt 's film ver // sion of " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " has become a minor cinematic classic . evinhardt 's fame , however , antedates his screen accomplishrents . Also rating mention were the numerous Berlin aaatera he established and the fact that he produced such spectacles for the stage as " Sunrarun " offered in New York during 1912 and the theatrical fantasy , " The Miracle , " which in 1923 aroused even greater interest on this side of the Atlantic . Had it not been for Hitler 's rise to power , Reinhardt 's " Festspiele " would doubtless have continued to attract audiences , both domestic . and foreign , well into the 1940 's . THOMAS G. MORGENSEN Queens SILENCE To the Editor : Your article on the luxury of silence , " Oases of Silence in a Desert of Din " ( Travel Section , May 25 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an unforgettable day in Hawaii . It rained the day we visited the Kasuga Shrine in Nara . The experience was memorable in every respect but one . As we slowly mounted the long flight of steps we were battered by tape-recorded chanting and singing ; it was welcome relief to reach the buildings away from the conspiracy of man and nature . Later , on our return flight to the States , my son and I stopped at Hawaii . We had heard of its wonders but still sought evidence transcending gushy brochures . One day we ascended the heights of Haleakala , an inactive volcano now preserved as a national park . As an artist and admirer of the Surrealist school of art , I felt that I had either landed on the moon or in a Magritte landscape . Driving to the top from lapislazuli water to the 10,000-foot-high rim of chocolatecolored cinders is a remarkable experience in itself . It was only when we reached the peak above the clouds that we realized that all sound had ceased and that approaching noises were miraculously absorbed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silversword plants , we found ourselves whispering our admiration for these occupants of an unreal world . I am sure that this peak cushioned on a cloud must be one of the most silent spots on earth . JOHN A. CEDERSTROM Merion , Pa . BRUGES To the Editor : I enjoyed your article on " Bruges : Belgium 's Living Museum City " ( Travel Section , May 18 ) . It is indeed a beautiful city , with many splendid sights . However , the top picture was not one of Bruges ' " quiet canals , " but one of the river Lys , thawing through Ghent , past the Graslei or Quai aux Herbes . PAUL G. SPAGNOLI Waltham , Mass . Our thanks to Reader Spagnoli and the many others who pointed out the discrepancy . Ed . THE BATTLE OF COWPENS To the Editor : Did Sol Stember ( " The Odyssey Through the 13 ExColonies , " Travel Section , May 25 ) , really visit all those old Revolutionary War bat-tlegrounds ? If he did he must have known that the Battle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina . But perhaps these actions in the South really matter // very little . Massachusetts has stolen the Revolutionary War , anyway . Mr. Stember would never have placed Concord , Mass. , in New Hampshire . EDGAR THOMPSON Duke University Durham , N.C. CAMPOBELLO To the Editor : Lois Lowry 's article on Campobello , " Where F.D.R. Sunned " ( Travel Section , June 1 ) , did a fine job . of describing one of the most majestic areas of the North American continent . A vacation based , at or near Campobello Island will enable the sightseer to visit breathtaking cliffs on the Bay of Fundy , East Quoddy State Park in Maine , quaint fishing villages where the people are more than friendly , famous resort communities and inland lakes where the smallmouth bass fishing is unsurpassed . I have found the best time to visit New Brunswick and coastal Maine , however , is in late spring , around the first two weeks of May . The weather is usually perfect . The snow has melted , the temperatures hover around 60 degrees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the blackflies remain unhatched . Another advantage to arriving in May is the locals are not suffering from " tourist shock " yet . There is one disadvantage : the F.D.R. cottage is closed in the early part of May . For one reason or another , the park officials do not open the house until June . Perhaps if they had a few more requests from persons like myself , the park officials would see fit to open up on May 1 . A home as historically important as Campobello should be open at all possible times . JAMES MCHARGUE Indianapolis , Ind . FRUSTRATION IN PHILLY To the Editor : The article , " A Day To Rejoice In Philly " ( Travel Section , May 11 ) , prompted me to take a young friend for a day trip there , and I 'm writing to spare others the frustrations we went through . The Dolley Todd House and the Bishop White House were highlighted in the article , so after a disappointing tour of Independence Hall where the crowds were large and noisy , we trotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked and signs explained that tickets for guided tours were available at Pemberton House . After asking the way , we found Pemberton House only to be told that tours were limited to ten people per half hour at the Todd House , and they were all booked up . Luckily , a few tickets were left for the last ( 4:30 ) tour of the Bishop White House with a limit of 15 per tour . Simple arithmetic adds up to 16 tours of the Todd House per day , ten people per tour to only 160 of the tens of thousands of tourists expected daily . And 240 can expect to tour Bishop White 's residence . On top of this , we found that a good deal of the Independence National Historical Park is undergoing renovations , and plywood and chickenwire fences block the majestic view towards the Pennsylvania State House . Also , the subway stop ( Fifth and Market ) is in deplorable shape , and holes and faults on the platform itself are not even blocked off or marked while construction - takes place . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds like sour grapes , you should have seen the look on my little friend 's face when she realized we were shut out . After reading Dolley Madison 's biography , she was more boned up on the subject than I.
