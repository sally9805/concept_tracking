The south side of Flint , Mich. , is a patchwork of auto factories , union halls , corner taverns and conventional churches . Yet in this prosaic setting has arisen in recent years a belief as startling as anything cult-filled California has to offer . The unlikely focus of the new faith is Bernard Gill , for 13 years a respected clergyman in the Church of the Nazarene . Fed up with " promotion , programs , plans , " he searched for a fiercer , purer form of Fundamentalism . Seven years ago , at 43 , he quit the Nazarenes and with a handful of parishioners established the independent Colonial Village Church . <P> Soon , however , ordinary Fundamentalism was left far behind . Gill began walking the streets of Flint each morning , pausing in front of every house to pray for a religious revival . Thousands of times he prayed , " My God , why is there no prophet in this land ? " Eventually the answer came : Gill himself was the prophet of the biblical " latter rain " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming . Gill got his first direct messages from God in February 1971 , when " I felt his words moving through my mind . " To keep them moving , Gill fasted for days at a time . He also took to waking up in the middle of the night for prayer , after which he would lie next to a stack of three-by-five cards and write down God 's messages . <P> Second Witness . It was difficult to be a prophet as well as pastor , husband and father of five . Gill announced that God had therefore provided a second " witness , " as described in Revelation 11 , in the person of Mrs. Mescal Mclntosh , then 45 , one of his parishioners . Gill began putting questions to God via Mclntosh and invited church members to do the same . Instead of " feeling " the words as Gill did , Mclntosh actually heard the voice of God , who , she said , " would just instantly dictate an answer as though he were on the telephone . " About 40 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were spellbound . Many began to receive their own dreams and visions , which Gill interpreted , Daniel-style . <P> Meanwhile Gill was busy directing the lives of his flock : women 's skirts must be below the knee and men must grow beards . Gill also came to see Henry Kissinger as the Antichrist because he was a powerful man whose actions affected the fate of Israel , and he sent such fiery spiritual threats in telegrams to President Nixon that the Secret Service paid him a visit . Local clergy inquired quietly about Gill 's sanity . <P> By last year Gill realized that a miracle was needed to make the masses recognize that he was a true prophet . For months he led the church to expect that this proof would be nothing less than the resurrection of someone from the dead . Last July 3 he announced in the church newspaper that the next issue would describe an event that would " publicly vindicate " him as a prophet . On the very day the paper was to appear , Gill , 49 , suddenly died of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits that Gill had come to her asking whether to see a doctor about his stomachaches . God told her to say no , and the prophecy proved fatal . But Mclntosh now saw God 's plan : that Gill would soon become his own " vindication " by rising from the grave .
