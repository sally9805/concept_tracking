Why would anybody besides Richard Daley want to run for mayor of Chicago ? " Because I care about this city , " says Richard Friedman , 41 , a gaunt and forceful lawyer who climbs mountains from the Andes to the Hindu Kush , treks through South American jungles and African deserts , flies gliders and balloons , works out with his judo class twice a week , and likes to squire Second City beauties around in his Porsche 911 . <P> A lot of people besides the Tru-deauesque young Friedman care about Chicago , but few would choose to take on the unpromising task of running against Mayor Daley , his loyal army of Democratic jobholders and what Friedman calls his honor 's " myth of invincibility . " But Friedman sought out the job from the Republican organization , managed to raise a skimpy $200,000 , and launched his campaign at a dead run . " Let 's go ! " says the candidate , jumping into his leased and unmarked Mercury . " Let 's move ! " Traveling with Friedman , reports TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bank holdup than leaving a political gathering . " By averaging ten hard-hitting neighborhood appearances a day for the past two months , Friedman has at least reached the point where his campaign is being taken seriously . <P> Placating the Whites . The people of Chicago have never heard his honor treated so roughly . " Daley the builder ? " queries Friedman . " No , Daley the destroyer . Daley the manager ? No , Daley the bungler . " From storefront to street corner , he declares in his low-key voice : " We 're going to sweep that aging , corrupt , manipulating politician out of city hall . " <P> The campaign 's most explosive issue is public housing . Ever since 1966 , the Chicago Housing Authority 's policy has been to erect public housing in predominantly black areas . But last year Federal Judge Richard Austin ordered the authority to produce a plan by which low-income housing projects would be scattered throughout the city , and last month he forced the authority to announce the plan immediately . <P> Daley quickly denounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the prospect of low-income ( i.e. , black ) housing in their neighborhoods . The plan was at fault , said the mayor , for failing to locate some of the projects in the suburbs . Crying " race politics , " Friedman charged that Daley had " suppressed " the part of the authority 's report that called for 500 suburban housing sites . <P> Friedman 's claim was partially confirmed later by a Housing Authority official . But it did not really solve his basic problem : how to satisfy angry , working-class , white homeowners without alienating his liberal , dissident Democratic and black support . <P> Daley 's Darlin 's . Nobody predicts that Friedman will defeat Daley for a fifth four-year term next week . But he has waged a more vigorous mayoralty campaign than Chicagoans have seen in many a year , and there are indications that even the 69-year-old Daley is beginning to take notice .
