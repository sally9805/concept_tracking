txt A week after the Securities and Exchange Commission issued its staff report on New York City 's financial crisis , a hotly disputed question remains : Did the banks " dump " the city 's securities ? If " dumping " means that the banks sold their inventories of city obligations at distress prices , the S.E.C. provided scant evidence of that . But if " dumping " means that the banks allowed their city holdings to shrink by letting those notes mature without reinvesting the proceeds in the new debt offerings that the banks as underwriters were selling to the public , that charge has merit . Whatever the correct assumption , the controversy over dumping has obscured a more fundamental question : Did the banks shift the risk of holding the city 's debt from themselves to the investing public by failing to disclose ominous inside financial information they had developed by virtue of their role as the city 's underwriters ? The S.E.C. report painstakingly doeu ; merits the underwriter banks ' acute fear that the city was in imminent peril of being shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks were asking the public to buy the city 's obligations . The S.E.C. report clearly indicates that the underwriters held back on alerting investors to this danger because they feared full disclosure would render the city notes unsalable . The S.E.C. maintains that the banks ' intimate knowledge of the city 's deteriorating financial condition  --  and in particular , the banks ' own investment decicisions not to buy any more of New York 's short-term debt ? constituted " material " information that the underwriters were obliged to disclose under Federal securities laws . How those laws apply to municipal debt is largely unsettled , but if the same situation had prevailed between a business corporation and its underwriters , disclosure clearly would have been required . The issue of disclosure has been largely overshadowed , however , by the emotionally charged dispute over dumping , a charge leveled at the banks by Mayor Beame at a news conference a week ago . In like fashion , all six banks named in the purchase of $98 million in city notes were not included . The bank told the S.E.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , " but the report concluded it was because of a weak market . According to some bankers , the only account relevant to whether the underwriters had dumped city securities was each bank 's internal , or investment , account , where banks carry the securities in their own investment portfolios . " The dealer account is not relevant , " said Jac Friedgut , a vice president of Citibank frequently mentioned in the report . Its function , he said , is simply to serve " as a pass-through or storage place " for securities the bank has acquired as an underwriter  --  that is , for immediate resale . Latitude Cited by Critics But the banks ' critics dismiss that argument as a red herring . They say banks have a great deal of latitude in where to place unwanted securities . Some may keep those securities in the dealer account , while . others may transfer them to the investment account . In any case , the S.E.C. 's figures on the banks ' investment account holdings of city securities show no clear pattern Citibank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York notes throughout the period . ( It explained that , for tax // S.E.C. report  --  Bankers Trust , Chase Manhattan , Citibank , Manufacturers Hanover , Morgan Guaranty and Chemical  --  issued denials of having dumped their holdings ? even though Chemical had not been accused by the S.E.C. of doing so . In fact , the term " dumping " ? which was never used by the S.E.C. ? is inherently ambiguous and depends on one 's vantage point . Indeed , to an important extent , the issue of dumping turns on whether one counts the enormous amounts of unsold city notes the underwriter banks still had on hand when the fiscal bubble burst : whether to count those notes in the banks ' own holdings  --  as the banks insist  --  or to disregard them , as the S.E.C. report chose . It makes a big difference . Based on S.E.C. 's reckoning , the banks cut their holdings by roughly half a billion dollars . By the banks ' version , the reduction was " only " $200 million or so . If , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold off their holdings of city debt as distressed goods , the S.E.C. report provides few signs of that . Although the report said that all the banks except Chemical " followed a policy of trying to reduce or eliminate their holdings in city notes by sales " and other means , it made no explicit mention of outright selling by the banks But if , as the banks ' critics insist , dumping goes beyond the " active " step of selling and also encompasses the " passive " approach of allowing holdings to decline by simply retiring obligations without rolling them over , the S.E.C. report does indicate some banks are guilty of the charge . $4 Billion of City Debt Sold The report notes that , during the period from October 1974 through April 1975 , when the banks sold about $4 billion of the city 's debt to the public , they bought very few of those securities for their own purposes . From December to March , for instance , when the banks sold about $1.5 billion in city notes , none except for Chemical retained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading accounts . And in mid-March , when the banks sold a huge block of short-term debt for the city , none retained any part of a $46 million chunk that was due to mature six months later . The report does show that during this fiscal turmoil , a number of the banks posted declines in their holdings of city obligations , mainly because their notes matured . The holdings of Bankers Trust , for instance , shrank to $58 million from $119 million , while Chase Manhattan 's overall position fell to $58 million from $165 million . If , following the S.E.C. , one excludes the banks ' holdings of the new city notes they tried vainly to sell in mid-March , the declines in position are even greater . Bankers Trust 's holdings would have plummeted to $18 million , a $101 million drop , while Chase 's position would have slid to $15 million , a $150 million drop . In the S.E.C. 's view , the banks ' purchases of March notes simply indicated that they had no choice : as underwriters , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S.E.C. reasoned , the March purchases were an unavoidable business necessity rather than a true investment decision by the banks . ' Desire to Assist the City ' But a few banks , which would show slight declines or even gains if the March purchases are included in ' the calcula= tions , argue that the issue came down . to interpreting internal bank decisions . They say the S.E.C. chose not to take them at their word . Morgan Guaranty , for instance , would , have shown a decline of $51 million in its holdings of city securities if a March reasons , it had decided not to purchase securities of any local governments . ) The investment account holdings of four of the other underwriters  --  Bankers Trust , Chase , Manufacturers Hanover and Morgan  --  declined  --  if holdings of the March issues are not counted . By the same measure , Chemical 's investment position rose slightly . The S.E.C. report also disclosed that two banks , Citibank and Morgan , had decided by early 1975 not to buy any city notes for the fiduciary accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this decision , as well as the internal decisions made by some banks not to add any more city obligations to their own investment portfolios , should have been conveyed to potential purchasers of the securities . Offered to Small Investors The question of disclosure assumes unusual significance in this case . For the first time , the city 's obligations were being offered to small investors  --  in denominations as low as $10,000 ? many of whom had never previously bought municipal securities . Traditionally , banks and insurance companies formed the market for New York 's offerings . For their part , the banks find the notion of disclosing their investment strategies hard to accept . " We make our investment decisions just like we make our lending decisions and that 's not public information , " one banker scoffed . " What would happen to the market if we had to tell the world every time we decided to sell a security from our portfolio ? " The S.E.C. presents a strong case of deficient disclosure by quoting a flurry of memoranda that circulated among the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S.E.C. noted , an internal Citibank memorandum discussed the possibility that note holders might not get first call on the city 's revenues in a financial crunch , and that the city 's employees might get paid first instead . Market ' No Longer Viable ' In a memorandum also written that month , an officer of Chemical told the bank 's chief executive . " the market for New York City obligations is no longer viable . " Despite the banks ' growing con. cern that the financial markets were being saturated with increasing amounts of New York City debt , no disclosure documents was given to prospective investors until the final offering was made more than three months later . The S.E.C. report characterized the.disclosure document distributed at that time as " materially inadequate . " The document , entitled " The Repdr.t , of Essential Facts , " omitted , among other things , any significant information about New York 's growing budget deficit ; budget gimmickry , or the prospect of an imminent financial crisis , the S.E.C. said . Compelling evidence that the bankers were fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained in. two documents written after the final offering of city securities . Poor Sales of Notes Cited The first , a memorandum written . on behalf of the heads of Chase , Morgan and Citibank in preparation for a meeting with Mayor Beame , cited the fact ' that the latest issue of notes was not selling well  --  even though , the memo said , : we had a clean legal and a thoroughly . acceptable ' record of essential facts ' - as -a substitute for a very damaging disclosure statement . " The second , a letter written by White &; Case , bond counsel to some of the underwriters , discussed the difficulties , of updating the " report of essential facts " in conjunction with any future offering of city notes . " The adverse information which Ikuuld be required in such a report would ' in all likelihood render the city securities unsalable , " the letter stated .
