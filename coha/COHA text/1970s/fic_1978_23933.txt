CONFRONTATION A short story by Arthur Koestler APRIL 12 It started with a dream , several years ago , when I was still in the Ministry . An urgent telegram is handed to me , but I am unable to decipher it . The letters are smudged , or the paper is altogether blank . I know that I am bidden to make a decision on a matter of life and death , but I can do nothing about it . That dream came back to haunt me at intervals over a lengthy period ; I think it only stopped about the time of my resignation . But then , a few weeks ago , there was another urgent telegram on the in-tray . This time the text was quite clearly printed  --  that much I could make out ; but again I was unable to read it , because I had broken my spectacles and the whole world had become a blur . Thus what had to he done remained undone , with disastrous consequences , all through my fault . The bother is that this crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the mounting tide invades the dry land . It frightens me . There were also other symptoms . So I have decided to start on the long-overdue Experiment , wishing myself bon voyage , and to record in this diary whatever will come out of it . I have kept several diaries , on and off , in my three-score years and ten ; this . I feel , will be the last . A romantic German novelist once wrote : " Memory is the paradise from which we can not be expelled . " I would add to that : " Memory is the hell from which we can not escape . " It makes a fitting motto for these jottings . APRIL 15 First experimental session . Result : nil . I just felt embarrassed , then got the giggles . Like an old foot  --  which , after all , is just what I am . APRIL 18 Second experimental session . It went a little better . After the first session I would not have recognized Dr. Adamson if I had passed him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorize his rather weak features as we sat facing each other across the desk in my study . It was decent of him to agree that we should have our sessions here instead of his consulting rooms . I suppose this is quite unorthodox ( though I can not see why it should be ) . Then he in turn made an unorthodox condition : my part in the dialogue is to be tape-recorded , but not his . He dislikes tape recorders , he said : they interfere with his spontaneity . I was tempted to ask : " And what of my spontaneity ? " but thought better of it . I did not want the Experiment to start with an argument . Besides , he could have replied , quite justly , that I am in the habit of talking into microphones at meetings , conferences , et cetera . Extract from transcript of second experimental session . Make yourself comfortable , Dr. Adamson . Will that armchair do ? May I offer you a drink ? Sorry , I am forgetting that I am not host but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a Picasso . Helen and I bought it donkey 's years ago . Rather striking , don ' t you think ? But to tell you the truth , this kind of picture tends to make me uneasy these days . I feel the silly impulse to collect the lady ' s eyes and ears and breasts from the various odd locations to which they have strayed , and to put them back into the proper places where they belong . You may think that I am a hopeless philistine , which is probably true , but I can not get rid of the idea that the woman in the portrait must suffer atrociously in her dismembered state . There is a distinct look of pain in that single , triangular eye that has been allowed to remain in its place . One ought to give her a shot of morphine and put her together again . How childish can you get in your second childhood ? . . . Yes , of course I have seen dismembered people . I had what used to be called " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trouble is I have forgotten what the point was . Nowadays I keep forgetting things . . . I even keep forgetting why I started on this experiment . Facing you like this , it all seems embarrassingly silly . Never mind , here we go , here we go ? ? ? . There is a lengthy pause on the tape . When my voice resumes , it sounds rather strained . . . On weekends when we managed  --  to get away to our country place , / loved to do some strenuous digging in the garden , going after the bindweed and those other tough , beastly things ; Helen used to call it my weekly stints in the concentration camp . One day , a few weeks ago , that family joke turned against me with a vengeance . I was getting rather exhausted , so I decided to call it a day and have a hot bath followed by a cool gin and tonic , when I suddenly understood , in a blinding flash of intuition , what it meant to be unable to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded gun pointed at your back . I told myself not to be silly , that it was all over and done with . But the next weekend when I took out my pickax and spade from the tools/led I remembered the rows of shivering men and women on that East European plain who had to dig a long trench in the frozen earth , five feet deep , ten feet wide , to exact specifications . When the trench was finished and considered satisfactory , they were lined up along its edge in front of the machine guns and the tipcarts with the quicklime . I wondered how many hours it had taken to complete the trench , and I tried to put myself into the place of one of those shivering scarecrows . I reasoned that as it had been a backbreaking job , he must have looked forward to finishing it . When it was actually done , and found to conform to requirements , the guards may have given a gruff bark of approval or even of praise ; and my alter ego may have experienced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job neatly done . . .. On some occasions they were given a minute or two to say their farewell prayers . Those were still the idyllic days before the victims were made to strip and gassed in batches . There are photographs in our archives of the scene just before the prayers were said , and of what happened immediately afterward ; but there are no photographs of the scene during that minute or two while the prayers lasted . Odd , is n't it ? . . . Oh , yes , those archives . When the war was over , I was assigned to an Intelligence outfit that specialized in unearthing that Sort of material  --  assembling the evidence . We collected these photographs as others collect samples of art nouveau . But that was many years ago , and I did n't turn a hair . Or so it seemed to me at the time . . . . There have always been people who could wade through the deluge without getting their feet wet . They have always been the majority . Once I believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thrashing about in a whirlpool and being sucked under . APRIL 20 Dr. Adamson seems to believe that collecting those photographs was a morbid hobby of mine . I pointed out to him that I was acting under orders . He shrugged and suggested that I may have unconsciously contrived to be given that job . That of course is sheer nonsense  --  or is it ? Anyway , when I told him about the end of my weekend digging stints , he advised me to take them up again , to break the spell . But he must have seen a sort of panic in my eyes , for he hurriedly withdrew his suggestion . To show my gratitude for this reprieve , I told him about some of the more bizarre symptoms  --  which otherwise I would n't have done , lest he should think I was certifiable . Extract from transcript of third experimental session . . . . At about the time when I decided that to be a weekend gravedigger digging his own grave was not a healthy hobby , another mania crept up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be no such word in the dictionary . There is an open fireplace in the library of our country house , and Helen and I both loved a log fire in the evenings . It was another weekend ritual . I used to split the logs with an ax and a steel wedge -- until one day I remembered certain methods used by the Aztecs in offering human sacrifices to the gods ; I shall spare you the details . You may call this farfetched , if you like , but now it is the cook 's nephew who splits the logs . Even so -- you can not deny that in some sense , to some extent , a log is alive . You only have to watch the fire to know it . As the sap is converted into steam , the log keeps hissing in its agony . And as the flames lick it more insistently , it shoots off wild sparks before it surrenders to the inevitable , is scorched , flares , withers , turns gray , turns into ash . If you watch carefully , each log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use to light the fire performs a grotesque Totentanz . As it turns from white into charred black , the print on it vanishes , the paper rears up as if in savage pain , it writhes , shrivels , twists , in the scorching flames before its final annihilation  - -  like a human body burnt at the stake . Believe me , doctor , watching an open fire is no fun . . . . So that was the end of another cherished weekend ritual . Helen did not seem to mind . APRIL 25 Here we go again . I have neglected this diary for several days  --  mainly , to be frank , because the whole idea of the Experiment seems to become more and more absurd . Or too clever by half . Anyway , at our fourth session ( or was it the fifth ? ) Dr. A. abandoned his customary reserve and delivered himself of a sermon . Its message was strictly predictable . I am , quoth Dr. A. , haunted by ghosts of my own making ; a masochist , or repressed sadist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a devious gratification from morbid fantasies . He wound up the sermon by mentioning various therapies and pills . I asked him whether my taking pills will stop torture now practiced by some forty underdeveloped and overdeveloped countries , and I described to him some of the juicier methods . " You see , " he hooted gleefully , " there you go again . You talk as if it were your doing . " " Of course it is my doing , " I told him patiently , " and yours . In fact , everybody 's . " He shrugged as if giving me up . APRIL 28 Yesterday Dr. A. came in briskly and pulled his chair up before I had a chance to do it , as if to demonstrate that it was he who was in charge of the proceedings . " At the last session we got rather bogged down , " he said , with his sheepish grin , " so today let us stick to simple facts . " He then suggested that I talk about the circumstances that led to my resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , the passion had gone out of it and only the bitter aftertaste remained . Extract from transcript of fifth experimental session . . .. I was supposed to have been quite competent at my job . At any rate , I was moved up the ladder a little faster than the average . Not much faster ; but that small headway made a difference . I had reached the level at which , in a small way , you begin to influence policy , whether you like it or not . Of course it is mostly a matter of marginal decisions , not of the big central issues that are decided at Cabinet level . But the trouble is that occasionally a marginal issue can have an unexpected effect on a central issue , if you see what I mean . One thing leads to another . That 's the rub : that one thing leads to another . It is like a chain that you drag behind you , a cannonball fastened to your leg . You can not make even a trivial decision that does n't lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how others can face up to it and why we are not all of us out of our minds . But perhaps we are . If that is the case , where shall we look for guidance ? I ? had my share in some of those marginal decisions . Most of them were unsavory tributes to expediency . On a few occasions I protested , and was overruled . That was when the dreams about the messages in the in-trays began . Finally , things came to ahead with the Borovian crisis . The public was kept in ignorance about that infamous affair . Do you realize that we still live in a Byzantine world ? The de-62 cisions that really matter are still made in secrecy . Parliament is an arena for shadowboxing . We no longer employ eunuchs in government , only moral castrates . There should be an inscription over the gates of all our Ministries : " Abandon your guts , ye who enter here . " Or : " Please leave your moral conscience in the gentlemen 's cloakroom . " Anyway , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember more or less verbatim the farcical dialogue with my Minister when I went to see him to hand in my resignation . He was a stuffed shirt and an old cynic ; he also had a gift for impersonating his colleagues in the Cabinet when he was with his cronies . His first name was Jack ; in the Ministry we called him Black-Jack . When I came in , he put on an aggrieved expression , combined with fatherly solicitude . " Sit down , Tony , sit down . Have a cancerette ? Must be an old joke , but I have only just heard it in Washington . Most peculiar the sense of humor of our dear cousins , most peculiar . . . . " " Minister , the reason I asked to see you . . . . " " I know , Tony , I know . That Borovian business . I am no more happy about it than you are . Not at all . Not a bit . But you must have realized by now that we have no choice . Whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a certain rare mineral indispensable to our national security ? History is a cruel sce-nario-writer . " " To blame history for our do the dirty work , calling our policy criminal , which I thoroughly resent . " " You yourself have just called it dirty . " " All politics are unhygienic . But there is a world of difference between the unhygienic and the criminal . Anyway , I take it that your decision is final . " " I am afraid it is . " " Well , we shall miss you , Tony . " " I doubt it , Minister . " MAY 1 So that was that . When I had finished my solo recital , Dr. A. expressed his feelings by a polite shrug . " For the life of me , " he said , " I can not see why you should feel guilty having acted in a way that does you the highest credit . After all , you sacrificed your political career to preserve your moral integrity . " " A fat lot of good my cherished integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the massacres are still not known and presumably never will be . " " What else could you do ? " " Get on a soapbox , spill all the official secrets , call the government a bunch of assassins . Instead of which I kept a discreet silence , honoring the unwritten rule that if you connive at a crime against humanity you may be forgiven , but not if you rat on your club or chums . " To this Dr. A. replied vaguely that few people can adopt a line of conduct that goes against their nature and upbringing ; besides , what difference would it have made to the fate of the Mutulis ? I told him that was beside the point , and I suspected that he somehow secretly thought that wretched African tribe was a figment of my imagination . I felt suddenly tired of the futile argument , and we left it at that . MAY 4 He ( Dr. A. ) insisted that I go on with my solo recital . I told him that I did n't see the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessionals , even confirmed agnostics , because afterward they feel better . l objected that this was a bogus confessional , absolution being guaranteed beforehand . But I did n't want to offend him ( after all , the little man means well , according to his lights ) , so I gave him a brief resume of my unremarkable life since my resignation . Retiring politicians and diplomats are usually offered sinecures in the City ; my own lot was to be elected to the boards of countless do-gooding bodies , from the RSPCA to the Committee for Prison Reform , from the League Against Racial Discrimination to the International Association for the Abolition of Torture , and so on . I found most of these charitable institutions sickeningly inefficient and as much torn by intrigues and struggles for power as any political body . So there was not much spiritual comfort to be derived from these quarters . I kept soldiering on , and still do , without illusions about the value of what I am doing . But I suppose one can not go on indefinitely in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarked on the experiment with Dr. Adamson .... Not that it has helped much , so far . We both seem to have settled down in our opposite corners of the boxing ring . When the gong sounds , we get to our feet to do some inconclusive sparring , duly recorded on the tape , and at the end of the round return to our corners , hoping that the next round will produce some decisive result . Here is an extract from the transcript of the seventh session : . . . There again I beg to disagree with you , Dr. Adamson . You keep calling my preoccupation with violence , torture , and pain a pointless obsession . Obsession -- perhaps ; pointless : no . After all , we are all daydreamers . It is a need , is n't it ? And what if you feel the need  --  the urge  --  to identify yourself in your daydreams not with the conquering hero but with his helpless victims  --  not with the victor but with the vanquished ? I can see nothing wrong with being an inverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is real , and I believe there is a purpose to it , though it is difficult to explain in your vocabulary . Why do we attend funerals ? To make the dead feel less lonely . And we write to the widow that we share her grief and pain , because we believe that sharing dilutes the pain as acid is diluted in water . Why do saints develop stigmata ? To share and thereby dilute the pain of the man on the cross . If there were enough Walter Mittys around to daydream the agonies of the damned , all suffering would be neutralized by their power of imagination . MAY 7 Dr. A. seems to become more aggressive with every session . I am surprised and puzzled by his change of tactics . Instead of sparring in the ring , he has taken to hitting below the belt . At yesterday 's session he quite unpardonably lost his temper and accused me of indulging in an attitude of " arrogant heartbrokenness , " wallowing in the mud and being " a glutton for punishment . " He actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried about what Helen might think of these goings-on behind the door of my study . In the end he apologized , but that was neither here nor there . MAY 11 To put it in a nutshell : I think I have caught a virus that attacks the brain . Inside this virus is the double-helix of anxiety and guilt , wound around each other like two snakes embracing . The air is saturated with that virus . You breathe it in , it infiltrates through your pores in all sorts of devious ways . I have seen it at work on some of my friends and thought I was immune against it , but now my immunity is gone . I am defenseless against the poison of horror and pity as I am defenseless against the need to inhale the smoke of my cigarette . Extract from transcript of eighth experimental session . Did you ever read Pascal , Dr. Adamson ? Do you remember his agonized cry : " The eternal silence of infinite space terrifies me " ? I am even more terrified by the universe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent block , with time as the fourth dimension , which contains the frozen past , present , and future . We crawl along inside it like blind maggots , and because we can only move in one direction , which we call the future , we believe that the past is wiped out . In reality , everything that happened is still happening ; everything that was , still is . The agonies of the past are preserved through eternity , the gas chambers are still working to full capacity , the witches chained to the stake still scream as the flames turn their feet into a black , oozing mass and their hair into torches . What was , is , forever , in the everlasting petrified present of the block-universe  - -  the eternal now of unyielding despair . . . . Whatever you say , I have a feeling that it is partly my doing  - -  that I have a share in it . But you will never understand this , my clever little man , because after all you are only my alter ego , a shabby embodiment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point one hears the sound of a door abruptly flung wide open , and the tape comes to a stop . What happened was that Helen , worried about the din , had burst into the study and discovered that I was screaming at the top of my voice at an empty chair . MAY 17 Thus ended the ill-begotten Experiment . I daresay Helen guessed from the beginning that there was something fishy going on in my study connected with the mysterious visitor whom she had never met . Yet it was she who , unwittingly , had implanted the idea into my troubled mind . She kept reminding me that I had a knack for sorting out other people 's problems ; so why should I not be able to do for myself what I did for them ? Instead of a monologue , enter into a dialogue : Tony , the patient , confronting Tony , the guru , across the desk . It would be a kind of do-it-yourself therapy . All I had to do was assume alternately the role of one or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I did n't know how to get one . Finally I settled for the empty chair across the desk , occupied by the phantom of Dr. Adamson , which , after the first few sessions , acquired quite definite features . Several times I even felt tempted to shoot him ( or myself ) . ... I must stop now and set the tape recorder up for today 's session . Dr. Adamson seems to be late , which has never happened before . ?
