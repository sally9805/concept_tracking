IT GAVE EVERYBODY SOMETHING TO DO by LOUISE THORESEN with E.M . NATHANSON 346 pages . Evans . $8.95 . <P> It was a blind date in a thousand . On Jan. 29 , 1958 , Louise Banich , a carpenter 's daughter , was what the dating-game pragmatists of the day called " fixed up " with William Erness Thoresen III . He was not only a son of the president of Chicago 's Great Western Steel Corp . but tall , handsome and charming as well . At 20 , Bill Thoresen was also something of a cutup . He already had a record for shoplifting violations and assault-and-battery arrests . But , as Louise explains in her account of the twelve years she spent trying to wear William 's dangerously cracked glass slipper , " He made my life exciting , and he needed me . " <P> Just how much William needed Louise became evident during their two-year courtship . On a motor trip through Maine in the summer of ' 59 , he got her to help him steal three brand-new canoes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Year 's Day , 1960 , she had evolved from a dutiful daughter , honor student and respected Chicago schoolteacher into an accomplished shoplifter and companion of an obviously disturbed boy . <P> Bags and Bullets . William 's father refused to give his son the more than $600,000 in securities that he was supposedly keeping for him in a duffel bag stashed in a large basement vault at the Thoresens ' North Shore mansion . Other duffels containing Mother Thoresen 's share and more than $1,000,000 worth of stocks and bonds were earmarked for William 's younger brother Richard . William got what he considered his share by stealing all the bags and refusing to return any of them until his father agreed not to press larceny charges . <P> After the birth of their son Michael in 1962 , Louise had to play mother , but William carried on much as before . He buttered up his brother Richard , who had got hold of his own duffel bag containing $1.1 million . Then William conned Richard into believing that he was his partner in a drug-stealing scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beneficiary of a new will . In 1965 Richard was found dead in a parked car with a bullet hole behind his right ear . <P> The police could never decide whether Richard 's death was murder or suicide . William , meanwhile , set out to become the largest private collector of military weapons in the country . He had an unfocused plan to become a dealer and director of his own gun museum , a sort of cross between Abercrombie &; Fitch and a National Guard armory . Even though he could not secure the necessary federal license , William was still able to acquire weapons from legitimate arms dealers , and he steadily collected scores of pistols , rifles , machine guns , mortars , land mines , plus crates of ammunition and even a 37-mm. antitank cannon . <P> Both he and Louise were repeatedly arrested on an assortment of gun charges . Still , the growing Thoresen arsenal spread from room to room in their large half-renovated mansion in the Pacific Heights section of San Francisco . When the police and Government agents finally confiscated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Attorney remarked : " The guy has so many munitions , I do n't know whether the Government should prosecute him or negotiate with him .
