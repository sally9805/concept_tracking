txt One thing is clear after British Prime Minister Edward Heath 's two-day visit here . His government is determined to try to end the uncertainty that overhangs Northern Ireland , and to this end it is prepared to impose a settlement on the long-troubled province . The uncertainty here has hitherto been total and has contributed to the continuing chain of violence between Protestant and Catholic . This uncertainty includes the young man unsure of holding his job in an area of high unemployment and factory closures due to violence .. It includes families unsure of keeping their homes while sectarian intimidation rages and civil war is a grim possibility . It stretches to the broader uncertainty about the North 's form of government and whether Ulster will remain British , become an isolated ministate , or join a united Ireland . Catholic minority politicians like John Hume are certain that Irish stability is impossible without ending partition ? but they doubt that Britain is yet ready to accept this unification as the only answer . Protestant majority politicians like Brian Faulkner are certain that the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that expediency may lead Britain to abandon Ulster and impose unification . Yet Mr. Heath did , to his surprise , uncover a broad area of agreement . Most of the people welcome the British Government 's discussion paper setting out options for the North 's future . Mr. Heath 's answer to the uncertainty is to build on the success of this " green paper . " There will be a limited round of further consultations with a deadline fixed so that the definitive " white paper " policy document can be ? published early in 1973 . The British Government 's final decisions will be based on a new principle announced by Mr. Heath in Belfast . It will draw up its own settlement and then " we put it to Parliament , and it 's for the Westminster Parliament to decide , " Mr , Heath made it absolutely clear that " there is no obligation on us to hold a referendum about internal arrangements for Northern Ireland . If Northern Ireland wants to be part of the United Kingdom , then it must have the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall have discussions with people and will balance many factors , then we will come to a decision ourselves . If Northern Ireland is to remain in the United Kingdom it must have the same standards of impartiality , lack of discrimination , and respect for law and order as we do , " // *Ulster settlement emerging ? // Mr. Heath 's words mean , in effect , imposing a settlement on the North . The expected protests have come from both Protestant and Catholic extremists , but even they have been low key . The center is holding . Apparently moderates accept that a just settlement can be worked out in a democratic way by the British Parliament rather than by demanding further head counting in Northern Ireland itself . Many in the North and South recall that they advised an imposed settlement long ago . And it is just possible that ? apart from the extremists ? both Protestants and Catholics would acquiesce in a British-imposed settlement . Former Unionist Party Cabinet Minister Robert Porter voiced privately a common Protestant feeling that the oddity of a separate provincial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1921 . He and many others would welcome a form of government closer to that elsewhere in the Commonwealth . On the other side , minority politician Paddy Kennedy , a Catholic , told this correspondent the Irish prefer the clan system to democracy . In any case , Edward Heath left behind here a strong impression of being a formidable clan leader with the determination to reach his own decision and impose it .
