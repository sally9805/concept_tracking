In Canada and Britain , the lid is tighter than in the U.S. <P> The competing needs for government secrecy and the public right to know have long posed a dilemma for Western democracies . In the U.S. , the most recent example is the case of Frank Snepp , the former CIA agent who was ordered by a federal judge last June to turn over to the Government any " ill-gotten gains " ( at least $60,000 so far ) from Decent Interval , his book charging the CIA with botching the evacuation of Saigon . The Government argued that Snepp jeopardized future intelligence operations by violating his secrecy oath ; Snepp 's defenders saw a discouraging precedent for future " whistle blowers . " <P> No matter how worrisome the Snepp case may be to U.S. public servants who break promises to keep secrets , they do not have to contend with anything like the Official Secrets Act in Canada or Britain , where it is a crime to disclose any government document without permission . These laws are currently under fire in both countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bizarre one concerns Alexander Peter Treu , 56 , a German-born Canadian and former Luftwaffe pilot who heads Canalatin Consultants , a Montreal electronics firm . In the late 1960 's and early ' 70 's , he worked on the design of communications and surveillance systems that were built for NATO by a larger Canadian firm . In 1974 Mounties raided Treu 's home and carted away 500 Ibs. of documents . In 1976 , after a long investigation , he was charged under the Official Secrets Act with holding on to classified documents without official authorization and failing to take " reasonable care " of them . <P> Just what Treu did wrong was not spelled out in the charge . Treu himself is not allowed to say ; if he does , he will go to jail . He is likely to be imprisoned anyway because he has been found guilty . On what evidence ? No one is allowed to explain that either . His year-long trial at Montreal 's Palais de Justice , which concluded last April , was conducted in secret . All that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> During his trial , Treu gave several interviews suggesting that he was the victim of bureaucratic bungling , which may have let his security clearance lapse without his knowledge . Indeed , NATO was still awarding contracts to him during his trial . Now free on $10,000 bail pending an appeal , Treu has been silenced by a court order , and officials hint only that the case is not insubstantial . <P> While Treu was being secretly tried this spring , the Canadian government used the Official Secrets Act for the first time against a newspaper , prosecuting the Toronto Sun for disclosing a top-secret Mountie report on Soviet espionage . Critics complain that the Sun , a persistent right-wing gadfly to the Trudeau government , is being charged not with spilling secrets but with revealing government ineptness at dealing with Soviet spies .
