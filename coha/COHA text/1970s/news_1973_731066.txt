Vizzini , the pres- ? ident of the Uniformed Firefighters Association , has conceded that he lied when he reported his membership had , voted " overwhelmingly " in secret ballots to endorse a strike . - The union official , now under investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney 's office , said yesterday through his lawyer that the misrepresentation of the vote tally had been made to protect his bargaining position in contract talks with the city . " What if he had announced that the vote had gone against a strike ? " asked Abraham Brodsky , who is representing Mr. Vizzini and other union . officers called by the grand jury . Position Held Untenable " What would his position have been ? He might as well have stayed home . What force would the union have ? If he lied , he lied for the benefit of the union to maintain his post- ; tion in bargaining , " the lawyer said .

Earlier , Mr. Buiar 's associate , Nick Cavatara , reported that it was Mr. Vizzini 's position that the strike vote conducted by the Honest Ballot Association was merely " a barometer of feeling " and was note binding upon the union 's 10-man executive council . Mr. Cavatara said that the actual vote total of 4,119 to 3,827 against a walkout had been reported Friday by the Honest Ballot Association and that Mr. Vizzini had reported his misstatement of this tally to a television news reporter on Saturday .

He said he had no plans to reprimand or even investigate the New York local , " unless opposition comes on the local level , " adding that to his knowledge there was no such opposition . " All of our locals have a great deal of autonomy , " he said . Herbert L.

" The whole premise of a strike as pressure in this situation is not valid since final binding arbitration is where it wound up . All he gained by his strike was an arbitration that he could have had without the strike . " Meanwhile , the Manhattan grand jury inquiry into the strike is to continue . Acting District Attorney Alfred J. Scott said Saturday that two members of the executive board of the union had been granted immunity and would be forced to testify before the jury today . He declined to identify these men . Two union officers have already appeared before the jury under immunity . Mr. Scotti said there were four possible areas of prosecution being examined , each a misdemeanor carrying maximum penalties of a year in jail . He described these as obstruction of governmental administration , reckless endangerment to the city , coercing the city to capitulate in a contract dispute , and conspiracy to commit these acts . " There is no fraud involved here , since fraud has to be connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said about the misrepresentation of the vote . " What that seems to be is deceit , and deceit by itself is no crime . " Mr. Brodsky , the union 's lawyer , said he was confused about what crimes were being alleged . " They 're trying to find something , " he said of the investigation . " They 're making a big deal about the destruction of the ballots , " he said referring to the union 's admission that it had destroyed the ballots on the day after the strike . When you have certification , when the union admits the vote was against them , what are they supposed to do with the ballots ? Paper the walls with them ? You ca n't redeem them anywhere . What are they making a big deal like this was Watergate ? " In addition to possible criminal prosecution the union officers face jail and fines for violating the state 's Taylor Law , which prohibits strikes by public employes , The city has also instituted court proceedings against the leaders for defying an anti-strike injunction.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
