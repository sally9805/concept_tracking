After the capture , the twisted killer 's life unfolds <P> " Kill ! Kill ! " chanted the vengeful crowd outside Brooklyn 's Central Court Building , even though the object of their hatred was nowhere in sight . <P> " That 's the father ! That 's the father ! " shouted others as scores of people mistakenly closed in on Leon Stern , a frightened defense attorney who fled into the courthouse . <P> " I want five minutes alone with the guy . I 'd wipe the floor with the guy ! " said Jerome Moskowitz , father of Stacy , one of Son of Sam 's 13 shooting victims . Added Neysa Moskowitz , mother of the slain girl : " I must see the face of this animal , this beast , this worthless human who took my baby 's life . I do n't know a death too horrible for this man . " <P> The fury was directed at David Berkowitz , 24 , a U.S. mail sorter , who was captured by police and identified as the lone gunman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of eight nighttime attacks in quiet residential neighborhoods . But as the city 's most massive manhunt ended , the killer of six young people ( seven others survived their wounds ) did not fulfill public expectations of the type of man who would automatically arouse suspicion , fear and hate . <P> To be sure , the thin half-smile he wore as flashbulbs assailed him was infuriating . But the paunch , the round and smooth face , the short , curly hair and calm manner all seemed far from menacing . Rather than sinister , Berkowitz looked innocuous , an unexceptional figure unlikely to attract attention anywhere . As the facts of his life began to emerge , the much-sought gunman turned out to be the loner the psychologists had predicted . He had apparently abandoned the few friends acquired in his earlier years , lived alone in a sparsely furnished apartment in suburban Yonkers , got along comfortably with fellow postal workers but rarely initiated a conversation , and kept his personal feelings to himself . <P> Even as police finally grilled the man who had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was neither sullen nor hostile . He talked readily of his crimes , showing amazing recall of each attack , correcting police on details that only he could know , never refusing to answer their impatient questions . <P> But then that twisted side of the mild-mannered killer 's mentality exposed itself . Why , why had he murdered ? " It was a command , " he said in a soft , nonaggressive voice . " I had a sign and I followed it . Sam told me what to do and I did it . " Again : " Sam told me to do it . Sam sent me on an assignment . I had to do what I had to do . I had my orders . Sam sent me . " Who is Sam ? Berkowitz said Sam is at the moment a neighbor of his named Sam Carr , but " really is a man who lived 6,000 years ago . I got the messages through his dog . He told me to kill . Sam is the Devil . " <P> Clearly Berkowitz is crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arraignment in the Brooklyn court , the judge ordered psychiatric examinations to determine whether he is sane enough to be prosecuted . Chances are he will spend the rest of his life in a mental institution .
