txt November gusts and blustery rains presage the advent of winter , but the Mother of Parliaments , threatened by bombs and rumors of bombs , still knows how to put on a splendid ceremonial that takes a bit of the drabness out of everyday life . Queen Elizabeth H opened Parliament in the tradition-encrusted House of Lords Wednesday . The keynote of the 13-minute speech written for her by Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his Labour Cabinet was a pledge to bring forward " proposals for the establishment of Scottish and Welsh asspmblies . " In rooms above and below , security police carefully checked for any hidden bombs . London had its 13th bombing attack since August Tuesday night , when a fashionable restaurant in Chelsea was shattered without warning . Security experts incline increasingly to the theory that elements in the Irish Republican Army deliberately are trying to promote a sense of insecurity and fear among the so-called establishment ? businessmen , members of Parliament , prominent politicians .

The peers , peere-%Ps , and members of Parliament hearing the Queen 's speech were of course aware of these possibilities . But it is Britain and its ills that preoccupy them these // *Parliament gets down to business // days , rather than the perennial and still apparently endless disputes of Northern Ireland . Devolution ? the proposal to transfer certain central powers to regional assemblies in Scotland and Wales ? is a passion-rousing issue to Britons because if mishandled it could lead to the breakup of the United Kingdom . Visions of North Sea oil wealth dance in the heads of many Scotsmen , and the Scottish Nationalist Party is fast becoming the region 's major opposition party , dedicated on paper at least to total independence , as its ultimate goal . Devolution is a debate that will go on throughout the new parliamentary session and probably into the year after that . More immediate is the still precarious state of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise of prices . Unions have had a hard time adjusting themselves to the notion that labor and management must work together creatively if Britain is to emerge out of recession and inflation . On the day of the Queen 's speech , newspapers announced an encouraging development in this field : the victory of moderates in mail voting for seats on the immensely powerful Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers . The AUEW is Britain 's second largest union , outnumbered only by Jack Jones 's Transport and General Workers Union . Whereas Mr. Jones has firmly insisted that ? 6 a week ( $12 ) is the maximum wage increase unions should demand this year , Hugh Scanlon of the AUEW has opposed this limitation . Leftists and moderates on the union 's seven-member executive have been tied three to three , and Mr. Scanlon has frequently used his casting vote to tip the scales in favor of the left . Now , however , members , voting by mail , have removed two leading leftists .

As a result , Prime Minister Wilson 's policy of bringing management , labor , and govern- ment together to fight inflation , increase quality and productivity , and put Britain back in the black is likely to win more wide-ranging support from the workers . The Conservative Opposition , however , attacks the government on another front : continued nationalization plans announced in the speech from the throne . Aircraft and shipbuilding industries are to be taken over , thus fulfilling one of Labour 's election pledges last year . Deputy Conservative leader William Whitelaw castigated the nationalization proposals , saying they would increase government expenditures at a time when every effort should be made to bring them down . While politicians quarreled , the Queen , radiant in her state crown , made her resplendent progress in her gilt coach , pulled by four white horses , to Parliament and back . The issues that confront Britain are complex and emotion-rousing . But the symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
