txt MRS . M A R5 E EVERETT , once considered the dominant person in Illinois racing , testified yesterday that fear of losing choice racing dates for her racetracks caused her to promise to sell some of her racetrack stock to former Gov . Otto Kerner and Theodore J. Isaacs , former state revenue director . She was called as the first witness in the racetrack stock trial of Kerner and Isaacs in Federal District Court before Judge Robert L. Taylor and a jury of six men and six women .

Kerner also is charged with perjury in concealing his racetrack stock . - The former owner of the Arlington Park and Washington Park Racetrack and two racing associations said she made the stock sale promise in 1962 to William S. Miller , former chairman of the Illinois Racing Board , and put it in writing so Miller could show it to Kerner and Isaacs .

Mrs. Everett said the assignment of racing dates was critical to the survival of her racing holdings because she had borrowed up to $8 million when her father , Benjamin F.

She testified that the failure to get the proper racing dates could have resulted in her going bankrupt overnight because of the demands on her to pay the interest and principal on the loan . HER TESTIMONY , in a deep throated voice , was barely audible and government and defense counsel had to ask her to repeat her answers . Mrs. Everett , dressed in a conservative blue and gray figured dress and wearing no jewelry and little makeup , gave most of her answers with her eyes directed toward the jurors . At times , she emphasized her answers by arching her eye-1 brows and gesturing with her hands in explaining basic racing management procedures .

Mrs. Everett said she notified Miller , who returned the check to Kerner . Paul R.

This case , like a good coin , has two sides . "
