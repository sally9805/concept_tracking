In the dawn of the nuclear age , Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Lewis L. Strauss predicted in 1954 that atomic fission would produce electricity so abundantly and cheaply that it would not have to be metered : the American people could just pay a low monthly charge and use as much as they wished . That naive optimism has long since vanished in the wake of zooming construction costs , endless delays in getting plants built and growing public opposition . In 22 years of commercial operation , nuclear power has won only a modest role in the nation 's total energy picture . Now , in the shock of the Three Mile Island nightmare , the question arises whether reactors will ever be able-or be allowed-to contribute much more than the 14% of electricity production and almost 4% of total energy consumption that they supply today . " The way I see it , the nuclear power industry does not have a future , " says an executive of an atomic plant near Toledo . His gloom is extreme , but the friends and foes of nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective campaign against the building of new nuclear facilities . Says Alexander Polikoff , executive director of Business and Professional People for the Public Interest , a Chicago antinuclear group : " If one blows in Pennsylvania , who is going to want to live near one in New Mexico ? " <P> Much will depend , of course , on the outcome and the assessment of the Pennsylvania drama . The Department of Energy had planned to ask congressional approval for the building of experimental repositories for nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for thousands of years . California and Wisconsin have in effect banned construction of new power plants until some better method of disposing of the waste can be found . Three Mile Island can only strengthen the hands of some Congressmen who have been insisting that licensing of new plants be halted unless a series of deadlines for progress on waste disposal are met , a move that could halt atomic power construction . <P> At present , 72 nuclear plants are operational in the U.S. , and the Carter Administration 's energy planners had projected as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of the country 's power . But construction has turned down sharply since the peak year of 1974 , when utilities ordered 26 new reactors . Between 1975 and 1977 , three or four a year were ordered ; in 1978 there were only two . Many earlier reactor orders have been canceled or deferred .
