From Miami to Vancouver , street people are on the road . Most Americans still mistake them for hippies , unaware that the hippies are " as faded as their jeans " ? they 've moved on to agricultural communes , or ' trimmed their hair , bought some socks and slipped back into the middle class . Colonies of street people have sprung up in every major American city and in , smaller towns along their travel routes . They settle in the rundown sections of town , or near the campuses of towns like Ann Arbor or Berkeley , creating " alternative " skid rows . The term " street people " ( as it is now used ) ; originated in Berkeley in the late 1960s , to describe young people who live marginally along Telegraph Avenue . At night they sleep nearby , wherever they can find a spot  --  in a park or doorway , on someone 's living-room floor , or when they 're lucky , in a hostel for transients . Street people are as alienated as the hippies were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominantly froM white-collar homes , were philosophically alienated . They turned their backs on the job market at a time when the economy seemed destined to boom perpetually , concentrating instead On Nirvana through drugs , Zen , health food and love . Money was a dirty word , though there was enough of it around . Some lived on monthly checks from worried parents ; others pushed drugs , or sold orange-and-purple posters to the tourists . ' When the boom ended in 1968 , the hippies died out and the street people began to , move in . Predominantly from blue-collar homes , they are older , than the hippies , have less education , may be brown or black as well as white , and have few marketable skills . Their alienation is often akin to despair , for they have ' been pushed out of the mainstream of American society and see no way to get back in . Like Thomas Wolfe , most street people feel they ca n't go home again . They ate the new migrants . Some have been kicked out by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcoholics or are swamped by their own problems . Many are the eldest of large families and felt the push to become self-sufficient . They grew up in small ' towns that are dying , or in metropolises overflowing with experienced laborers who are out of work . Henry Miller , associate professor ' of social welfare at the University of California , has been studying youth on themove for several years . He finds street people closer in kind to . the hobos and the migrants of the 1930s than to either beatniks or hippies . Says Miller : There 's a popular myth floating around that the poverty of youth is self-imposed , but the fact is , we 've produced a generation of young people for whom there are no jobs . The labor market ca n't absorb them , so they seek other routes . Periodically in history there have been cataclysmic events that coughed up great numbers of peOple and made them wander about looking for ways to survive . The plague of 1386 is a classic example , but our own depression is closer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people riding the railroads illegally . A quarter of them were under ' 25 . We 're in the midst of another upheaval now , though we have n't acknowledged it . Miller 's preliminary studies indicate that there are now more than a million Americans under 25 on the road in this country . A few hundred thousand more are wandering , across Europe and Asia , selling gewgaws to tourists outside American Express offices . Now European and Canadian street people are beginning fo show up in the streets . The ' question ' ' of who is responsible for helping street people is a sticky one . Social agencies in every city are inundated with young transients seeking food , shelter , medical help and , above all , jobs . But budgets have been cut and there are hardly enough facilities to serve the residents . " Go home , " is the frequent advice , and when traditional agencies do try to help , there is often mutual misunderstanding , for the life styles of street people and the middle-class social workers are worlds apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " alternative " agencies has sprung up across this country and in Canada . Set up by organizations , ( often religious ) , or by citizens ' groups who saw the need for such services , they are usually staffed by young people who have been on the street themselves or are familiar with that culture . Most popular are switchboard/crisis intervention centers  --  currently called " hot lines " ? which plug people ' into services available in the community , and make referrals to appropriate agencies . The Haight-Ashbury Switchboard in San Francisco , opened in 1967 , serves as a model , its mimeographed manual of office procedures haying been sent on request to more than 200 emerging switchboards . It tells how to Celeste MacLeod is a free4ance journalist living in ' Berke-ley , Calif. handle everything from drug overdoses , psych freak-outs and potential suicides to office procedures like maintaining current job and housing files . At the Haight Switchboard , the deadliest sin is to " tell the caller you ca n't help her and hang , up . " Run entirely by volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy day and night , receiving calls from all over San Francisco and finding crash housing in private homes for as many as eighty people a night . It has difficulty finding the $250 a month its operation requires . The Travelers Aid Society , long in the business of helping transients , is one " traditional " agency that has adjusted its operation to a clientele that is increasingly young and poor . Cathy Greene , casework supervisor at the San Francisco office , says well over half the young transients they see come from small towns in Middle America . Often they are afraid of " the hippies " and wo n't go near the Haight-Ashbury or Telegraph Avenue , but their economic predicament is similar to that of their urban counterpart . " Young people who come ' to Travelers Aid are marginal in every sense , " says Greene . " They have little education , maybe 8th to 10th grade , and they 're underemployed , if they 're employed at all . They 're among the most desperate people in the nation , because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Greene is amazed that people still think of California as an endless job market . One 19-year-old man who arrived penniless from West Virginia summed up the myth : he had heard " there 's plenty of work in California , and the women is friendly . " The current job situation is bleaker in San Francisco than anywhere , except maybe Seattle . While the ' Berkeley-San Francisco area remains the favorite stopping place for cross-country nomads , other cities are seeing numbers of disaffected young people who stay within their own state 's boundaries . Hitchhikers froni surrounding towns pour into Detroit , New Orleans , Atlanta and Denver . Alternative agencies in Boston and Chicago now serve a predominantly local or regional clientele , although their doors are open to all . The most comprehensive and best-funded program in the country is Boston 's Project Place . Opened in 1967 " to provide services to people whom traditional social service agencies were not reaching , " Project Place worked with more than 60,000 people in the Greater , Boston area last year . Its large paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has helped train personnel for twenty-four new hot lines in nearby suburban areas , as well as operating a round-the-clock switchboard , a Runaway House and other services . Chicago also has a network of neighborhood hot lines . These days , runaways ( youths under 18 ) go to local centers when they exist ; otherwise they are likely to head for the Midwest , which is becoming a haven for them . Word has gotten around that it 's tough to survive on either coast if you 're under age . There are currently more runaways in Iowa ' , Nqbraska and Nevada than in California or New York . The coastal street populations are getting older . The Streetwork Project , a resource-referral center in Berkeley , sees , the gamut of street people . Recent typical cases involved finding a part-time job for an 18-year-old New Yorker who had been jailed for shoplifting an avocado from a local supermarket ; lining up work for a couple en route from Los Angeles to Boston , whose possessions had been stolen from their van ; and trying to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital . The staff at the Streetwork Project is concerned about the rising number of mentally ill people who are on the streets , and the lack of facilities for them . The Nixon Administration has been cutting funds for mental health clinics as an " economy " move , and California is in the process of closing down its state mental hospitals , saying the mentally ill ' should be cared for locally . " The community facilities these people are supposed to go into simply do n't exist yet , " says Jim Baumohl , 23 , , former director of Streetwork Project and now a doctoral student in social welfare at Berkeley . A number of the perennially unemployed who haunt alternative agencies are chronically disoriented , he says , and thus unemployable . They gravitate to Berkeley , or to San Francisco 's Tenderloin , because most communities will not tolerate their bizarre behavior . . Even if the cost ' of their room and board is covered by " Aid to the Totally Disabled , " there is the problem of where they can live and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative agencies get " burnt out " trying to work extensively with people who need residential psychiatric care . In a 1973 study made by Baumohl and Professor Miller at the Emergency Food Project in Berkeley , 22.3 ' per cent of the people eating supper there in a given week said they had been hospitalized at least once for psychiatric reasons . The percentage is actually higher , says Baumohl , because the most disturbed people were unable to fill out the questionnaire , and others may have been reticent about their pasts . The Baumohl-Miller Street People Study is the first large-scale , quantitative study of street people to be done in this country . The street people have been recognizable as a subculture since 1970 , but they have been eclipsed by the media superstars who have preceded them . Journalists adored the hippies and the flower children , whose offbeat life styles made spicy copy . Middle-class readers devoured the articles , for they were reading about their own children , or at.least those of the neighbors . So much was written about the flower children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory , that it is hard to realize their era lasted less than a year . In the spring and summer of 1967 , swarms of young people poured into San Francisco . They put flowers in their hair and held " love-ins " in parks near the HaightAshbury district  --  the sudden center of hippiedom . Then the economy began to falter , and crime and drug addiction seeped through the Haight . As the carnival atmosphere turned into a nightmare , the hippies and the flower children drifted out , disenchanted with the drab . population that was encroaching on their domain . Journalists followed suit . Destitute people ? from lower-class homes did not make good copy . . Back then , drug addiction among the young was often attributed to suburban ennui from a surfeit of material goods and opportunities . It is a lack of them that leads street people to drugs . Preliminary findings of the Street People Study indicate ' that virtually everyone had tried marijuana ( not . considered a drug around Berkeley ) , , 87 per cent had taken LSD at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one-fifth said they had been addicted to some drug , mostly heroin or barbiturates . The health of street people is chronically poor , and the Free Clinic , opened in 1969 , is struggling to keep its medical , psychological , emergency and dental sections open . Working in a chUrch basement , it uses trained paraprofessionals , backed up by local doctors who volunteer during'the evening . The trained workers keep getting younger , says Natalie Zarchin , theladministra tor , as people become tired of working for $100 , a month . Baumohl and Miller found that half of their respondents had graduated from high school , but only twenty-three out of the 305 surveyed had a college degree . One-third had never finished high school , and 7.6 per cent had less than a 9th-grade education . Eighty-six per cent were unemployed and the 14 per cent who worked had only part-time jobs , usually as gardeners , dishwashers in restaurants or domestics . A few earned a little money by selling their handicrafts . More than 25 per cent reported that , they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including one-day jobs . More than half of those questioned were chronic transients , with no fixed address . Hitchhiking is the most common form of One . reason for the ride centers is the danger women may face if they bum rides alone . In the Street People Study , 19 per cent of the respondents were female ; of these , one-third reported that they had been raped at least once . Only four notified the police . ( Street people often fear police more than anyone else . ) In return for room and board , some homeless women sleep with men who pick them up ; it is a kind of subsistence prostitution . - The term " street people " does not describe one homogeneous group , Miller and Baumohl point out ; their , study reflects only a segment , those in Berkeley during March , the " off season " for transients . While their subjects were predominantly from urban areas on the East and West Coasts ( 35 per cent from New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania or New England ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come from smaller inland towns . To add to the confusion , individuals in the hippie mold are still on the streets , and a substantial number of high-school and college-age tourists travel the country each summer . Both these groups blend in with the street people , because everyone wears the same uniform ? ,  - -  long hair and faded jeans . A - lot of - young children are traveling with their parents . The fifty children eating at the Food Project in the week of the study were not surveyed , but every alternative agency sees such families . One 2-year-old girl has , been on the road since birth ; her parents plan to wander indefinitely . A New England family with nine children was in Berkeley last summer seeking crash housing while the father looked for work . . More local switchboards following the Boston pattern can reduce the number of people who take to the road because of family or individual psychological problems , but the best possible agencies can not find full-time jobs for street people if the jobs do n't exist . In spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every young person can become successful ( i.e. , rich ) by working hard , living clean and persevering cheerfully . Add to that myth a national complex about hippies and you have a bad scene . The first step to improving it is to recognize that the widespread unemployment of youth is a national problem . The next step is to do something about it . As long as the United States operates under the work ethic , whether or not there are jobs , it will have to create work for the unemployed  --  and that is a task for the federal government . During the ' 1930s the Roosevelt administration , through the Civilian Conservation Corps and the National Youth Administration , coped with an unemployed youth problem far more serious than the present one has become  --  as yet . Today we have a good supply of innovative men and women who could devise programs suitable for the growing youth problem of the 1970s , given the opportunity and the funds . The missing link is an administration in Washington that is willing to help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
