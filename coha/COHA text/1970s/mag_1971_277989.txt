In the 1930s , the theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and one of his graduate students at the University of California , Hartland Snyder , proposed what seemed like a wildly improbable idea . When the nuclear fires of extremely massive stars die out , they suggested , the stars collapse so completely under the pull of their own gravity that they literally crush themselves out of existence , leaving only a " black hole " in space as evidence of their passing . Now , just as scientists are beginning to study the first tentative signs that there really may be such black holes ( TIME , April 5 ) , they are also being asked to consider another fantastic notion : the existence of " white holes . " <P> In Nature , Astrophysicist Robert M. Hjellming of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank , W. Va. , argues the possibility of holes that are the complete antithesis of black holes . Such opposites are common enough-for example , the negatively charged electron and its antimatter version , the positively charged positron . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black holes . They are sources of matter that could literally come from out of this world . <P> Popping Matter . Hjellming 's hypothesis may be the answer to a question that has bothered scientists ever since the existence of black holes was proposed : If matter really vanishes inside black holes , as if they were bottomless pits , where has the matter gone ? British Theorist Roger Penrose suggested some time ago that the missing matter may pop out elsewhere in the universe - or even in an entirely different universe . <P> Picking up where Penrose left off , Hjellming says that the point at which the matter re-emerges in the other universe would be a white hole . Even more intriguing , this passage of matter would not be a one-way street . Matter would also leave the other universe through black holes , says Hjellming , and appear in ours through white holes . Thus the flow of matter between the two universes would be kept in balance . <P> Hjellming admits that such strange funnels between universes sound about as real as the rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he adds , some evidence may already be at hand that white holes do exist . One of the great puzzles of contemporary astrophysics is the huge amount of energy - cosmic rays , X rays , infrared radiation - that is apparently coming from distant quasars and from the centers of galaxies , including the earth 's own Milky Way ; the output seems to be greater than can be accounted for by known physical processes , including the conversion of matter into energy by thermonuclear explosions . If it could be shown that matter and energy were coming from another universe , Hjellming says , that problem would be neatly solved .
