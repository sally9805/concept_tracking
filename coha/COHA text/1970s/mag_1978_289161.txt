Coming : 70-plus gas <P> Motorists enjoying the balmy Indian summer driving weather that has persisted in many parts of the U.S. have sometimes had a shock when they decided to " fill ' er up . " At some service stations , especially in the Northeast , NO GAS signs hung on the unleaded fuel pumps ; other signs set limits on the amount a customer could buy . Almost everywhere , meanwhile , prices have been creeping up instead of slipping back as they usually do after the peak travel season . <P> The scattered shortages and climbing prices result from heavy demand . The summer bulge in gasoline use was bigger than expected this year , and it has stayed up because of the mild weather . In early November , for instance , consumption was as high as it had been in August . But production has dropped , because of breakdowns at some major refineries . To meet demand , companies have been buying gasoline from outside sources at premium prices , and passing their added costs on to the consumers . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it costly to switch to lead-free production , and difficult to turn out fuel that meets the Government 's minimum octane standards and still allows the new cars to run smoothly . To encourage increased no-lead output , as of Dec. 1 the Department of Energy will allow refiners to pass more of the actual costs of producing gas on to consumers , which could mean a further increase in prices from 2 to 4 per gal . In the past year , the average price at the major companies ' stations has risen from about 62 per gal . to more than 67 some Manhattan gas gougers now charge more than 90 . Given the fact that OPEC is about to raise the cost of crude oil again , and that this may add 2 or so to prices at the pump , for most U.S. motorists 1979 will clearly be the year of 70-plus gas .
