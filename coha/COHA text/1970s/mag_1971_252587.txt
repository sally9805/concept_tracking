Alice left home in Wilmette , 111. , to work in a San Francisco supermarket . Darlene , from Chicago , took off for Frankfurt , Germany , to live with a bus driver . Florence abandoned Lake Forest , 111. , to become an artist in Spain , and Rose left Hartford to live with another woman in Chicago . <P> All four women have opted for what was once an almost exclusively male prerogative : abandoning their spouses and running away . According to private detectives , there are now more runaway wives than ever before . Ed Goldfader , a Manhattan private investigator , says that two years ago only 2% of the spouses he was asked to track down were women . Last year the figure was 23% , and this year it is 42% . Chicago Detective William Wilson says that the pattern used to be runaway husbands 4 to 1 , but " there has been a complete reversal in the past four years . " <P> Easier Divorce . The increase seems to parallel the rise of Women 's Lib , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Women now feel freer to go off with other men and leave their children to the care of their husbands . Besides , running away has become financially easier . Women have more education and can more readily find jobs . They are more affluent , so they can afford to flee by plane or in the family 's second car . They also have the Pill-and the prospect of easier divorce . " Years ago , " Investigator Gold-fader sums up , " a girl could run only to Mama , who would have told her to go home . Now , chances are that not even Mama 's home . " <P> Many runaways appear to be weak , immature women whose flight is really a petulant plea for more understanding . In fact , 50% of runaway wives eventually go home on their own or are easily found because they have failed , more or less intentionally , to cover their tracks . <P> But there are many more determined female deserters . Nina , for example , was a 36 year-old Massachusetts wife with a maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband who drank too many martinis and made too many passes at other men 's wives . Committing what Gold fader calls " social suicide , " she fled to the West Coast and took on the identity of a friend . There she got a job in advertising and acquired a new Social Security number using her friend 's name . Despite her elaborate precautions , she was located through her real birth date , which she gave in applying for company insurance . <P> Poor Sources . When a wife flees , her husband is at first apt to believe that she must have had an accident . " She would never do this on her own ; I know her , " he often says with absolute confidence . In fact , investigators report , husbands can usually offer few facts to help in the search for their wives . In other words , they really do not know them , which was probably a major cause of trouble all along .                 @ @ @ @
