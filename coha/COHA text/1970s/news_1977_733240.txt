txt Presidential watchers here are divided , roughly , on how Mr. Carter will deal with Bert Lance , his director of the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) . Some say it now is inevitable that the President will have to get rid of him . Others say that barring a finding by the comptroller of the currency that Mr. Lance has broken a law in his previous banking and private borrowing operations , Mr. Carter will seek to ride out the storm and keep his valued friend and adviser at his side . And still others say that it is likely Mr. Lance will step down voluntarily in the wake of recent pressures . The comptroller , now looking hard into Mr. Lance 's banking and loan activities , is focusing on this question : Were interest-free deposits made by Mr. Lance 's former bank , the National Bank of Georgia , in the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company of New York City and the First National Bank of Chicago only the kinds of deposits usually required to secure the services of those banks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " compensating balance " for personal loans of about $2.6 million and $3.4 million that Mr. Lance obtained from the two banks ? ' By Paul S Conklin Are his days With Carter numbered ? If the comptroller finds the latter to he true . then he may conclude that Mr. Lance has broken the law . But if the comptroller clears Mr. Lance of illegal activity , Mr. Carter is still left with a serious political problem : What to do about the " appearances " of wheeling and dealing on the part of Mr. Lance ? // From page 1 Carter 's quandary : to keep or drop Lance The comptroller now is looking into a number of private dealings by Mr. Lance and has broadened his probe of Mr. Lance 's finances to include those of his family , friends , and two of his former banks . Washington Post cartoonist Herblock portrayed Mr. Carter 's problem by showing Mr. Lance , decked out in gambler 's togs , passing the collection basket in a church where Mr. Carter is preaching a sermon . A member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still say it does n't LOOK right . " Thus , some veteran observers here are saying that Mr. Carter will find it difficult to keep Mr. Lance around even if the comptroller clears him of any illegality . Says one who has closely watched and measured the conduct of several presidents : " This President , more than anyone I can remember , must avoid the appearance of wrongdoing ? in himself and his administration ? as well as avoiding wrongdoing itself . " Watergate legacy Because of Watergate , presidents now are expected to keep especially high standards of conduct for themselves and for those around them ? standards that are above reproach . Also , Mr. Carter 's emphasis on living a good Christian life was a basic element in his appeal as a candidate . He has , as a result , been looked upon to set a particularly high standard of virtue and conduct for himself and for those he selects to serve with him . The theory now gaining ground in this city is That Mr. Lance will himself , without any prodding from Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in  --  even if it does not charge him with illegal deportment . Mr. Lance , it is argued , would be very sensitive to how the appearance of ineptitude in his own private financial transactions would make him an embarrassment to a president who has promised to put the economy on a better course . Pressure on Lance The " heat " that now is on Mr. Lance , from official sources and from the press , has developed rapidly in the last few weeks . There are some observers here who say the media was slow to dig into the Lance case simply because reporters found the man so warm and engaging . A congenial , " nice guy " who , even when rumpled and tired , never lets the slightest irritation come into his voice , Mr. Lance is a person who makes a point of calling newsmen by their first names . Before the recent disclosures , Mr. Lance was rated as one of the President 's top personal assets , as well as one of the most powerful and influential figures in the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a way back to his influential role at the side of the President . But at this point the prospect seems rather dim .
