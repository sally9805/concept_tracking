JUDGING from the mounting costs of political campaigns , one might conclude that democracy , as practiced in the U.S. , is fast becoming a millionaire 's game . Certainly H. John Heinz III , great-grandson of the founder of H.J. Heinz Co. , would not be Pennsylvania 's Congressman from the 18th District today were he not the inheritor of 57 varieties of fame and revenue . But Heinz 's constituents , from suburbanites to mill workers , seem so happy with his performance that they are expected to return him to office with a stunning margin . <P> It is not hard to see why . Heinz , 34 , has drawn heavily upon his own funds and talents to represent the polyglot residents of his district , which includes the northern and southwestern suburbs of Pittsburgh . In a single year he has built up one of the best political organizations in the western part of the state . A former advance man for Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott , Heinz is already being eyed as a possible successor for Scott 's seat . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard University Business School-Heinz joined the family business . Within three years he had assumed a top sales job , but he was restless . In 1970 he quit to become a lecturer in business administration . After Representative Robert Corbett 's death left a House seat vacant in the spring of 1971 , Heinz declared his candidacy . <P> Launching his $146,000 campaign with a breakfast aboard a river excursion boat , Heinz never let up . He conducted opinion polls on dozens of subjects , blitzed the district with position papers , and wined and feted labor leaders , political pros and volunteer workers . One presumable campaign asset was his attractive wife Marie Teresa Simoes-Ferreira Heinz , 34 . Born in Mozambique , she speaks French , Spanish and Portuguese , but can use very direct English when talking politics . She shocked one group by labeling it " a bunch of bigots . " <P> When it was all over , Heinz had beaten his opponent , also a millionaire , 2 to 1 . He and his wife set up housekeeping in Washington , D.C. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Czar Nicholas I ( it cost the Heinzes $500,000 ) , and plunged into the capital 's social life . But Heinz has taken his political responsibilities seriously . A hard worker and self-styled moderate , he has bucked the Republican leadership on some big issues , including the war . Last spring on the floor of the House , he questioned the mining of Haiphong Harbor and the bombing of the North .
