" I would much rather have written the best song of a nation than its noblest epic . " So said Edgar Allan Poe , the 19th century American poet , teller of horror tales and inventor of the detective story . A vulnerable sort , tormented by melancholy and eventually by drink , he was infatuated with the mystery and dramatic power of music . Years after his death in 1849 , composers-Sousa , Rachmaninoff , Debussy-found themselves equally fascinated by the music of his words . <P> In his new opera , The Voyage of Edgar Allan Poe , Minneapolis-based Composer Dominick Argento , 48 , has chosen to treat not the author 's creations but his life . Introduced brilliantly last week by the innovative Minnesota Opera Company in St. Paul , the opera takes Poe 's death as its starting point . <P> He was found lying on a street in Baltimore , near delirium , dying . In his last contact with friends , in Richmond , he had said he planned to take a boat to Baltimore . No record of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nolte have used that mysterious boat ride to construct a metaphoric voyage of selfdiscovery : Poe , the crazed poet , relives his loves , sins and miseries . <P> Grim Waters . In essence , Argento and Nolte have written an opera for the music lover who also enjoys the dreamscapes of Fellini and early Bergman . Moods billow like the Dry Ice currents that lap across the stage , suggesting waters as grim as the Styx . Characters are rarely who they seem to be . Even Poe is not always sure who or where he is . His antagonist is a shadowy character named Griswold - based on Poe 's vindictive literary executor , Rufus W. Griswold - who seems to be lago here , Mephistopheles there , even turns into Poe himself . <P> The music is a mix of serialism and tonality that saturates the evening with multiple layers of consciousness . Argento 's orchestral score , in a masterly interpretation by Philip Brunelle , can be as gruff as Strauss at one moment , as ethereal as Debussy the next , sometimes underlining the drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , Argento can write for the voice . The land beyond , a second-act aria for Poe 's wife Virginia , is almost Mozartean in its poignant simplicity . Virginia died of consumption at 24 . In the opera she is resurrected , but after singing her aria , she dies again . It is an enviable role that allows the soprano to die more than once , and the limpid-voiced Karen Hunt makes the most of it . But it is the men who dominate Poe , as they do in operas like Otello and Don Carlos by Argento 's idol , Verdi . Tenor George Livings ( Poe ) and Baritone John Brandstetter ( Griswold ) go at each other with sonorous hatred . <P> Poe is Argento 's eighth opera , and as fine as any ever written by an American . Its success is an appropriate sequel to the Pulitzer Prize he won last year for his song cycle From the Diary of Virginia Woolf . He is a rarity among composers in that he knew nothing about music until age 14 ( when he read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano lessons until 16 . Three years later he was a piano major at Baltimore 's Peabody Conservatory of Music . The first summer he read the letters of Mozart . Recalls Argento : " I do n't know exactly why , but I do know that when I came back to school that fall after read ing those letters , I was a composer . " No doubt about it .
