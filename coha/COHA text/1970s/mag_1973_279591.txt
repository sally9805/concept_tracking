FOR one of the stories in our twelve-page section on the cease-fire this week , we asked TIME correspondents who have reported from Indochina for their most vivid impressions . Roy Rowan , now in Hong Kong , recalled the atmosphere in June 1948 . The military language was French then , the berets red , Americans as scarce as they were later to be ubiquitous . But the datelines - Tay Ninh , Ben Cat , Can Tho , Pleiku - were to remain bloody constants for 25 years . <P> Thumbing through 59 TIME cover stories is another way to review the twists , shocks , hopes and frustrations of the strangest war in U.S. history . Through the 1950s , it was still a foreign conflict , and the cover subjects included Emperor Bao Dai , Ho Chi Minh ( top two ) and Ngo Dinh Diem . When a military coup felled Diem in 1963 , Murray Gart , now chief of correspondents , watched some of the action from a Saigon rooftop . There was only one central cable office in Saigon then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bangkok to file material for a cover story . <P> Our men in Saigon , along with their colleagues in Washington and New York , had one basic mission : to explain a war that grew more baffling as well as more costly . We profiled the leaders of Saigon and Hanoi and the dissident Buddhist Thich Tri Quang . Cover stories on Dean Rusk , Robert McNamara and Lyndon Johnson charted Washington 's goals and tactics , while two others on General William Westmoreland , who was Man of the Year for 1965 ( middle ) , described the military strategy that seemed so promising then . <P> The Tet offensive five years ago was a turning point . Despite the Communists ' huge casualties , it demonstrated their determination and continued power to strike ; it had great impact on U.S. opinion and politics ; and it started a reappraisal that made many publications , including TIME , skeptical about the war and critical of U.S. policy . But there were chapters yet to be told , including the protest movement and the big Northern offensive last spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to the coming peace examined the war 's effect on the U.S. and Viet Nam . <P> The war profoundly affected journalists . Marsh Clark first visited Viet Nam seven years ago , later served as bureau chief , and is now back in Saigon for a brief stint . " The mark of Viet Nam is forever on me , " he says . " My language is altered , my hair grayer , my eyes sadder . Hamburger Hill , My Lai , the Green Berets , assassinations , mistaken air strikes , refugees and kids with napalm burns . The U.S. may try to forget , but that will be hard . " <P> - <P> On the cover : South Vietnamese woman holding flags in preparation for truce ; Le Due Tho and Kissinger after initialing in Paris ; U.S. airman tossing helmet at Tan Son Nhut airfield , South Viet Nam , after cease-fire news ; P.O.W. wife Margaret Lengyel.
