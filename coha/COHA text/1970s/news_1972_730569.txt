txt In Kampala these days there are many locked and shuttered doors . Along the whole length of Williams Street collapsible metal gates stretch across storefronts . Padlocks hang on them , silent testimonials to their now-departed Asian owners . In the block between Dastur and Burton Streets there are  --  or were ? 43 commercial establishments . At three o'clock last Thursday afternoon only two of them were open for business . All that remains of a whole block of businesses are names written on dusty windows : Mehta Nylon House , GM Auto Mart , Continental Dry Cleaners , Dr. Harish Ruparelia and Meganlal Virji , Patilal Pattni , and Bhagwanji Tulshidas , all of them goldsmiths , In the offices above these stores worked lawyers , accountants , and insurance agents . They now are all gone . Hot plates and electric fans still sit in the window of Hassanall K , Dharamshi 's appliance store . Above the entrances of others hang vestiges of feigned loyalty and vain hopes : paper flags bearing the grinning image of Idi Amin , Uganda 's President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorways of these stores ,  - -  African tailors now have set up sewing machines , They work intermittently in the hot sun , calling out in laughter to familiar passersby . This scene on Williams Street recurs throughout the business districts of this capital city . At night downtown Kampala is virtually deserted . There are no more lights and music , no more curry smells wafting from the apartments above the stores . No longer do sari-clad women window-shop in the cool evening air . At nine o'clock one evening last week the darkened sidewalks of Kampala Road , the city 's main street , were all but empty . There were only three night watchmen , already seated and waiting for sleep , and one pedestrian , a foreigner . But with numerous Africans disappearing , nighttime Kampala 's empty streets probably result as much from fear of the Army as from the Asians ' absence . Not all the Asians have left . " I 'm exempted , " said an Indian citizen encountered in a restaurant . He was the head of the science department at a secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three Asian families remain . " I 'd like to stay as long as I can , " he said , signaling the African waiter to complain about the service . " I 'm leaving tomorrow , " declared a young accountant , a Uganda citizen . " If I do n't , they 'll make me go to a village . " He referred to President Amin 's plan to rusticate all citizen Asians , a scheme generally regarded as his method of " expelling them through the back door . " " I think all citizen Asians will have left by the end of the year , " the young man predicted . // *Padlocks dangle in Uganda // What the Asian departure portends for Uganda is not yet entirely clear . This is partly because the complete strategy of General Amin 's economic war is not yet known . At this writing it appears possible that British aid technicians and missionaries , including doctors and teachers , also will be forced to leave . ' To what extent Arab and both imported and local African personnel can fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already is ? considerable dislocation in the country 's economy and in basic services , particularly health and education . Economically sophisticated residents express concern about a breakdown of Uganda 's electric-power system , about the scarcity of spare parts and of technically qualified personnel to effect repairs President Amin already has complained about vehicle breakdowns and Toyota , among other automobile manufacturers , has set up a - crash program to train African mechanics . " All of this shows a lack of Intelligence , " states an appalled African diplomat . " It shows a lack of standards in all walks of life . They are literally turning back the clock here . " Many Ugandans , however , look at the locked doors as symbols of opportunities now open . Some analysts point out that the extent to which Asian commerce was catering to the Asian and expatriate groups is still unknown . Others underline the need to distinguish between the substance of government moves and their style . One diplomat states , " I 'm not so sure the Ugandans are n't going to come out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too early to judge . ' One thing does appear certain , however . Uganda 's economic and commercial sector , as well as downtown Kampala , will become increasingly African in character . The Asians ' enterprise and discipline have left the country . Things will be done now with greater ease and joviality , with less hurry , efficiency , and precision . And sometimes they wo n't get done at all .
