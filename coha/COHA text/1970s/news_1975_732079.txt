txt In what appears a direct response to abolition of the oil depletion allowance , the nation 's oil companies have drastically cut back on oil and gas exploration , some by more than 20 bar cent . Some industry experts believe the cutback is the beginning of a downward trend and are certain it will be followed by a corresponding drop in United States oil production by 1980 . The cutback , by both majors and Independents , comes at a time when known U.S. oil reserves are being rapidly depleted and new oil finds are vital to reducing dependence on foreign oil . IT ALSO ENDS one of the greatest exploration booms in the country 's hist ? . ry which followed the imposition of the Mideast oil embargo and the serious fuel shortages in late 1973 and early 1974 . In July of 1974 , for example , a record number of 334 seismographic exploration crews were at work in the U.S. seeking new reserves for the country 's oil cornpanics . By comparison , only 190 crews were out in a normal year before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kept by the Society of Exploration Geophysicists and considered the best gauge of exploration activity , has dropped from a high of 300 in January to a low of 286 in July . J. DAN SKELTON , on Exxon executive and president of the geophysics society , says the July figure is especial ly significant because the summer is the peak time for exploration . " This is indeed an alarming drop , " he said . " We fear it is the beginning of a downward trend that will Is for the rest of the year . A dropoff In drilling will follow and four or five years later You will see a dropoff in oil production . " Altho industry spokesmen attribute the dropoff in seismic exploration ? the Most widely used process of locating major finds ? to a variety of factors , it clearly coincides with passage of the 1975 tax cut bill , which included repeal of the domestic oil depletion allowance . THE AMERICAN Petroleum Institute has estimated that the repeal increased the taxes of the big 12 American oil companies by $567 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry sources , many companies need cash earmarked for exploration to pad the tax bills . At the same time , they said , profits were reduced to the point that the risky and costly exploration business lost its priority to more profitable pursuits . While the cutbacks affect the overall exploration budgets of : nest companies , the onshore exploration of large companies and the smaller independents seem to have been the most adversely affected . STANDARD OIL of Indiana , for example , the number one onshore " wild utter " among the major oil companies in North America , cut back its exploratory operations in the U. S. by more than 20 per cent  --  an estimated $10 million cut in onshore activities in the U. S. and as much as $30 million overall . According to Gordon , the company 's production manager in Chicago , the cuts were all carried out in a six-month period , amplifying their effect and causing significant pullbacks in such gas-prone fields as the Appalachian basin . Some of the majors , such as Exxon , have long since all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their efforts in more promising offshore activities where the costs are normally shared by other companies . SAID TI1E cutback . in Standard 's geophysical exploration program was directly related to the oil depletion allowance and reduced company profits which " reduced our cash position and took the incentive away . It hit us right in the pocketbook , " Most companies , he said , had to look to short-term high risk programs to ab- ? sorb the reduction because they were unable to adjust their participation in longer range cooperative or " group shoot " exploration programs offshore , or production agreements . R.W. Bybee , operations manager of Exxon 's exploration department in Houston , says that the oil industry " ought to be expanding its exploration " rather than cutting back . BUT lIE SAYS the industry will not move unless uncertainties about its financial and political future are resolved . " Exploration just costs hundreds of millions of dollars that we wo n't have , " lie said . The continuing increase in the price of foreign oil , the threat of the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offshore U.S. oil leases , he says , " are constantly changing the risk and economic factors . " ' Bybee predicts another exploration boom once the leasing of U.S. offshore rights in Alaska ? and the Atlantic and Pacific gets under way later this year . " WE ARE DOING our geophysics sale by sale and evaluating these new tracts and we 're going to continue to buy attractive tracts , " he said . " But until we have those initial sales and find some oil and gas on them , we 're reluctant just to go all out like we once did . " Government officials are hopeful the expiration of price controls on domestic oil and the sale of new offshore leases will stimulate a new boom in exploration . " But until we see the price issue cleared up , " said Frank Zarb , head of the Federal Energy Administration , " we 're not going to see the kind of exploration we 'd like . " WHILE DRILLING was up overall during the last two years , like exploration , it has begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , In statistics released Sunday , noted that 7,073 wells were reported completed during the second quarter of this year , a 3.2 per cent increase over 1074 . But the figure was down from 0,568 reported in the first quarter of 1075 . Noting that earnings of the nation 's top 25 companies were down to $2.3 billion from $3.6 billion in the second quarter of last year , API predicted a further corresponding decline in drilling .
