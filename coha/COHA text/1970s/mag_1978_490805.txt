THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment W E have received a number of letters about the big snowstorm last week . This one is from a man we know who is in his fifties and lives in the East Nineties : On the second day of the storm  --  the real day of it , not the warmupI looked out my living-room window in the middle of the morning and suddenly decided that I had to go to the office . There was no reason for this , because , like most offices in town that day , mine was closed , and I had nothing much to do when I got there anyway  --  if I got there . But something drove me out just the same , and I bundled into several layers of clothes and stuffed my pant legs into my good old leather-topped , rubber-bottomed Bean boots and put on an old ski cap ( a skating cap these past few years , if truth be told ) , and said goodbye to my wife , who said I was crazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and falling snow , and slogged my way around the corner , leaning and staggering by turns against the shove and tug of the wind , onto Madison Avenue . I grabbed a bus-stop stanchion there , for support , and in that instant I could feel something like the full power of the wind , which was rapping and banging the metal bus-stop signs over my head , and which made the pole strain and quiver like the mast of a ship blown onto its beam-ends in a gale . Frightful weather , yet I was anything but alone in it Storekeepers and supers were shovelling away all around me , scraping and clanging their big shovels and sending up clouds of snow , even though it was plain that the storm was gaining on them every minute . A lot of them seemed to have young volunteer helpers  --  school kids off from school , manning the pumps . I made it over to Fifth , sometimes walking on pavements blown bare by the wind and sometimes plunging the Bean boots out of sight into the drifts . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own breathing , and I paused now and then and stared at the giant white wind-rippled , wind-fingered Arpshapes of buried cars along the way . When I got to the Avenue , I saw that the plows had been right on the job this time . There was a narrow almost clear lane down the middle of the street , and now and then a solitary car or cab clanked slowly by , making interesting , fishlike sidewise movements and leaving interesting , wind-tunnel flake effects in its wake . There were six or seven huddled , bundled-up men  --  or possibly women , or possibly leftover peasant extras from some crowd scene in " Doctor 7. hivago " ? waiting at the bus stop , and the word was yes , there were some buses still running . So I stood there , in good company , on a lumpy snow mound at Fifth and Ninetieth , with the wind and the cold and the snow all blowing and hurrying about , and with the lovely old Park trees above me all creaking and swaying , and their black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt showing black through the snow in one hare place ; and then more people shapes appeared through the snow-gray mist ( some of them making great curbside leaps through the piled-up snow , like deer leaping in the winter woods ) , and I knew all at once what had driven me out on this ridiculous trip on such an unlikely day : it was joy . I do n't think the joy was just the good ordinary morning feeling of being out in new snow on a weekday , when most people are sensibly at home , and I do n't think it was the kind of holiday joy that comes of thinking about all the children being at home that day , because of no school , and my still remembering what that was like  --  how it was to savor a whole day ahead with nothing to do but go to the Park and play in the snow , or else not even do that but just stay at home and do nothing all day and not be told what you had to do next . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the bus came and we all clam-bered and crowded aboard and the bus went slowly poking along do wntown , with the wipers clacking and the big wheels slithering and crunching and squeak-ing in the snow beneath us , and nobody in the bus sore or in a hurry , because nobody was getting anywhere on time that day . Stand-ing up in the hack , I looked out the bus windows , sometimes leaning over and wip-ing away the fog on a cold window with my glove , and I saw that the streets seemed to be full of condensation  --  vast steamy clouds of it billowing out of sewers and manholes , and ragged puffs of it rising from the fountain ponds in front of the Metropolitan Museum ( no fountains today ) , which were rally with snow squalls , and I saw that more and more people had come out in the storm and were heading for the Park , in gigan tic hoots and wild hats and stripy scarves and snow-clotted mittens , and carrying cross-country skis , a lot of them , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Park , and there was joy in that , too , of course . But I am getting this wrong , writing it like this , because it sounds as if the joy were simply because of the snow and the weather , as if it were just the weather and nothing more , and it was n't  --  not all of it , anyway . It was the event that mattered . Something was happening , and it was happening to me and to everybody else , and that made me think that perhaps at my time of life ( or perhaps just in this city at this time in the world ) almost nothing ever really happens , and that is why days slip away so dully and ansaously and scarily now , most of the time  --  almost all the time . But on this morning I felt time passing and I did n't mind it at all . I loved it . In that wind and in the swirling flakes amid the rising steam and in the slow , rocking , boatlike movements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking me with it . I felt the movement of the day and the year going by , and me moving inside it , and that double motion was beautiful . And then it occurred to me that perhaps it is never right to think , Time is passing , the way I usually do , because that suggests that we are stationary  --  like some rock or ledge being worked on by the movement of wind and tide . The fact is that we are moving as well  --  moving at a speed too great for us ever to understand it and almost too great for us even to notice it  --  and a day is coming , of course , sweeping up on us in a wind , when we wo n't he there to feel it , or to feel time at all . Perhaps it would be more reasonable for us to feel that time may be a stationary place through which we are all moving , together and alone . Days like the day of the storm will come again , other special days , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement  --  the tiny backward tilt under our feet , the unexpected weight in our heels  --  that makes us take a little half step and grab for the overhead handle as the bus goes on . This feeling , I should add , is very different from the way I used to feel just a few years ago , when ? so many days seemed fresh and full of happenings , and every day seemed to go on forever . This is better . One thing more . I have begun to notice that these sudden and uninvited surges of joy have come on me more frequently in the past few years , and have of-ten been followed by abrupt downturns , feel-ings of sadness and loss , which have usual-ly lasted longer than the good parts . I am a grownup , and I know what that may mean . Like many middle-aged people , I have had a .71 --  ,  - -  // few friends , good friends , who unexpectedly started to become too happy , or happier than any of us have any reason to expect , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drawn blinds . Whispered calls to Dr. Me-serve . They were taken away , and by one means or another it was arranged for them to become less sad , and less happy , too . Pills were prescnbed , or sometimes they were plugged into surprising machines that lit up their eyes to an unbearable brightness for an instant or two and then dimmed them to a more acceptable level , and in time the good friends returned and talked apologetically and amusingly about what they had subjected us to back then when they were so glad and so sad . They were no longer quite the same friends we had remembered . All this is no news , but it came as news to me that I had to think about such things there in the bus in the snowstorm , because of a morning of joy and a few minutes of intimation . I did n't become sad during the rest of the bus trip , or any time that day , it turned out , but I had begun to watch myself again , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I do n't know . What had been happening had stopped . Watch it there , Mac . Allegro non troppo . ANOTHER letter was from a young man who lives on Riverside Drive : As I made my way home from work through the snowy , half-deserted streets of midtown Manhattan on the first afternoon of last week 's big storm , I began to experience combined feelings of edginess and euphoria which were hauntingly similar to sensations of the not so distant past  --  sensations whose cause remained stubbornly hurled for a long while in the depths of my brain . Finally , when I got in from the cold , and was looking out on the winter scene from the comfort of my apartment , it was the sweltering summer scenes of last July 's blackout which rose before my mind 's eye and identified themselves as the unlikely hidden association . Back then , too , at least one full day in the life of the city had been knocked out by the weather . That time , the culprits had been the sun and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow , but there was the same feeling of unexpected-holiday fun tinged with nervousness and dismay , the same ambivalent wish that the crisis would end quickly but at the same time break all records for that type of crisis , the same counterpointing of the visible , present , natural disaster with news stories of the looming , intangible , man-made disaster of municipal bankruptcy , and the same paradoxical realization that natural adversities that might be only minor inconveniences in the countryside , where nature supposedly had full dominion , were trans-formed into major crises in the big cities , where nature was supposed to be well under control , if not entirely fenced in and paved over . Also , there was the same brave show of being on top of things by a city administration that was in fact largely helpless . ( It was probably to create the desired appearance of mastery that City Hall called its headquarters for snow clearance the Snow Command Post  --  a name that seemed to make its head , Sanitation Commissioner Anthony Vaccarello , the Commander-in-C his f of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where to blow and the snowflakes where to fall . ) As I listened to the almost non-stop radio coverage of the storm , it occurred to me that the weather in genera seemed to have increased its clout considerably in the last half decade or so . Some of the change , I recognized , reflected nothing more than stepped-up news coverage . On local television , especially , the behavior of the weather  --  the oldest story on earth  --  had become urgent news . The weathermen , now called meteorologists , and often respectfully addressed as " Dr. X " or " Dr. Y , " were being allowed more air time and more vigorous personalities than almost anyone else on the news programs . With their maps , pointe rs , and satellite photographs , and their highly technical talk of fronts , pressure zones , and wind-chill factors , they were delivering what had become in effect nightly graduate seminars on the weather . Indeed , the new Happy Talk News formats that had recently been adopted by television stations all across the country made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the serious news , almost seem to add a note of gravity to otherwise increasingly silly proceedings . But if journalistic ratings wars were part of the reason for the weather 's new prominence , it was also true that the weather seemed to he impinging on people 's lives in some new ways . The winter cold first put the country on notice of its new powers early in 1974 , during the Arab oil embargo , when the gasoline pumps were close to dry and when many businesses were compelled to shut their doors and many homes to go without gas and oil . With the New York blackout , the summer heat showed what it could do . It was turning out that widespread reliance on air-conditioning , central heating , automobiles , and other devices whose purpose , at least in part , was to protect us from the weather had left us open to attacks by the weather from another direction . The country 's estimation of the weather reflected the new events . Somehow , the winter cold seems colder when you know that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems hotter when you know that it can blow nut the power system , Nor any increase in the ferocity of nature , then , but a new frailty resulting from human artifice is what makes the weathermen chatter on about the wind-chill factor , and what made me think last week of the blazing sun of July while I watched the February snow . STILL another letter was from a ? . -3 young woman in the Village : Ash Wednesday fell this year on the day after the forty-hour blizzard , a teasing , lovely , giggly day , full of warm sunshine , impudent breezes , and running waters : the gratuitous good mood of a person who has got away with something -- -a temper tantrum , a bit of preposterous mischief . The storm knows what it is doing , said somebody . Lent is such a fine invention  --  perfectly timed , wise to human needs . Just the remembrance of Lenten disciplines is a relief from the idea of self-denial for reasons of narcissism ( the fast versus the diet ) and of introspection for reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream ) . In the secular world in which I live , it is perfectly possible for Lent to pass all but unnoticed : one day some people on the street have ashes on their foreheads , and a while later it is suddenly Easter . But I do not consider myself liberated by this oblivion . I feel more like a person who has lost the beat . Lent is associated in my mind  --  though I suppose this is a subversion of its true purpoec with a quite personal kind of freedom and also with a sharpened sensitivity . The Lenten food my mother served when I was growing up was savory : lentil soup ; pickled herring ; beet greens with oil and vinegar ; pumpernickel and cheese  --  no butter . Small portions , precious , intently tasted : special food that made one aware of the specialness of food , just as the creation of a special time made one aware of the specialness , the deliciousness of time . In the convent school I attended during my high-school years , we rose each morning at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during Lent by the unadorned altar and sombre texts . But all this was balanced against what was happening outside the chapel windows . In midwinter , Mass began in darkness and ended in the gray light of dawn , but during Lent the sun would begin its early rising in earnest , and through the chapel windows one would on some days see melting snows and streaming tree trunks and , spreading across the sea beyond the hockey field , a sunlight that was definitely honeyed . Those were the beginnings of days such as Ash Wednesday was this year  --  deliriously seductive , shamelessly false . The false springs of February . Lent defies the conventional division of the seasons . It brackets one of the most difficult , extraordinary periods of the yearly cycle  --  the transition from winter to spring . We need Lent to get us through that  --  a rhythm in a confusing season , something to steady our focus . One of the reasons I miss daily Mass is that it provided a very private space in which to recollect oneself during that vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a space that more modern rituals clutter with the " Today Show " and the Times . Lent as I remember it provided something similar on a larger scale  --  a protected time in which to recollect oneself to oneself as the earth , after many a false start , gorgeously , painfully thawed . ? ?

A sign above the entrance to the Caf ? Borinqueneer indicates that the place is available for catered weddings and christening parties , but the business card of the proprietor , Miguel A.

Early last fall , shortly after the rooster , not long out of the shell , arrived on these shores from his native Puerto Rico , he went to work at the Borinqueneer . At the time , his given name was Ye-Ye , and his main duty was to strut along the bar and divert customers during slack periods between Shows Latinos and performances by the Go-Go Girls . When he was n't doing that , he was confined to a back room , where he made so much noise that Haim Gabai , in his locksmith shop , could hear him . Eventually , Mr. Gabai went next door and persuaded German Roman , a Borinqueneer employee and the erstwhile owner of the bird , that a bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that a young rooster might not be a health asset to the bar .
