( AT RISE : COHN , overweight and fifty , is at the stove , reading from a cookbook and mixing ingredients into a pot . He is humming a Mozart aria . He hums , cooks , tastes . Across the room , ABE , underweight and fifty , lies in his chair staring into space . He lights a cigar and meditates . ) ABE It 's getting better . COHN ( Tastes . ) Who says ? ABE I say . COHN ( Mixes . ) With what evidence ? ABE My eyes are my evidence . COHN ( Turns to ABE and raises two fingers . ) How many fingers ? ABE Five . COHN Some eyes . ( Goes back to his cooking . ) ABE All right , two . COHN ( Slams down the pot and turns to ABE . ) So if you can see two , why do you say five ? ABE I prefer five . COHN That 's not a reason . p. 3 ABE Why does there always have to be a reason ? COHN Abe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you there 's never a reason . ABE And you ? You 're better off ? COHN I do n't invent . ABE I beg your pardon . Neither do I. COHN What kind of fool am I living with ? You just made up five . ABE I did n't make it up . COHN Not a minute ago . ABE No . COHN I was holding up two ( Holds up two fingers. ) and you said I was holding up five ! ( Holds up five fingers . ) ABE You are holding up five . ( COHN quickly puts down his hand . ) COHN What 's the use ? ABE Cohn , I 'll tell you something  --  you 're rigid . I 'm flexible . COHN Mindless . ABE You only believe in what 's in front of your nose . That 's not mindless ? COHN I do n't make things up . p. 4 ABE ( Points to curtained doorway . ) What 's that ? COHN Do n't bother me . ( ABE continues to point . ) It 's my bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ABE I do n't see any bedroom . COHN You know it 's my bedroom ! ABE I beg your pardon . All I see is a curtain . ( COHN goes and pulls back the curtain . ) Ah hah ! A bedroom ! ( ABE rises , crosses to the doorway , and pulls the curtain back into place . ) A curtain . ( Pulls the curtain back and forth . ) A bedroom . A curtain . A bedroom . A curtain . A bedroom . Is it still a bedroom when you do n't see it ? COHN It 's always a bedroom ! ABE So for you it 's always a bedroom and for me it 's always five fingers . ( COHN slams the plate down on the table , pours stew into it , and begins to eat . ABE joins him at the table , studies the blank sheet in his typewriter , punches one key , and nods seriously at the results . ) I 'm right , so I do n't get any stew ? COHN You want stew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABE ( Looks into pot . ) It 's empty . COHN ( Points to empty pot . ) What 's that ? ABE A pot . COHN You saw me cook stew in it ? ( ABE nods . ) You saw me pour stew out of it ? ( ABE nods . ) So eat your stew . ( ABE , unhappily , watches COHN eat . COHN wipes his mouth and points to the empty space in front of ABE . ) Eat ! That 's steak . That 's potatoes . That 's salad . That 's beer . Hearty appetite ! ABE That 's vicious . COHN ( Smiles , self-satisfied . ) Abe , you can pull the wool over your eyes but you ca n't pull it over mine . I know you every step of the way . I know you inside and out . ABE I 'm hungry . COHN So make something . ABE You know I do n't cook . I burn everything . COHN Do n't . ABE My mind wanders . ( COHN gets up , crosses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets a plate in front of ABE , and pours the uncooked spaghetti into the plate . ) It 's not cooked . p. 6 COHN I say it 's cooked . TWO fingers . Five fingers . Eat your spaghetti . ( ABE looks disconsolately at the plate , picks the spaghetti sticks up in his hand , and begins to eat them . COHN watches for a moment , then relents . He takes the plate away from ABE and pours the spaghetti into a pot of water on the stove . ) When will you learn ? ABE To be like you ? I beg your pardon , is that such a blessing ? COHN Do n't get personal . ABE I do n't like being made a fool of . COHN You asked for it . ABE I know I 'm right . ( COHN groans . ) You can win the argument but it does n't mean you 're right . Inside I know who 's right . COHN You think so ? ABE I know so . With my ex-wife , I also lost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COHN With her you were right . ABE So if I lost with her and was right , you have to admit that when I lose with you I also could be right . It 's consistent . COHN Abe , I 'm going to tell you a little story . A parable . After I finish , you tell me what it means to you . O.K. ? p. 7 ABE Before I eat ? COHN Here . ( Cuts him a slice of cheese . ABE wolfs it down . ) Once there was this beautiful , innocent , young maid , golden locks , of eighteen , who lived in a dark forest in the country with her very proud , strict parents , and it was her habit to sit by a pond day in and day out , and moon and mope about the moment when love would first enter her life . One day this lovely young thing is daydreaming by the pond when a frog hops out of the water and into her lap . The beautiful maid recoils . " Do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not what I appear to be . I am in truth a handsome young prince cast under a spell by a wicked witch and this spell can only be broken when some fair maid takes me into her bed and spends the night by my side . " So the girl calms down and decides why not ? So she brought the frog home and she took it to bed with her and the next morning she woke up  --  and lying next to her was this tall , handsome , naked young prince . And that 's the way she explained it to her parents when they walked in on the two of them . What 's the moral of the story ? ABE The moral is , you 're a very cynical man . COHN You want dinner ? Then discuss it intelligently . ABE ( Leaves the table and returns to his own chair . ) The moral is , you take a classic fable with charm and beauty , that deals with dreams and imagination , and you change it into men's-room humor . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Leaves his chair , crosses to the typewriter , punches a key , and sits back down again. ) p. 8 COHN You would believe the girl 's story ? ABE I beg your pardon , I would n't be her prosecutor . I leave that to you . COHN Supposing you 're the girl 's father ? ABE I would face the problem with compassion . COHN First admitting it 's a problem ! ABE A man in bed with my daughter ? At first  --  until the situation 's cleared up , I have to admit it 's a problem . COHN Then she tells you the story of the frog . ABE Which clears up everything . COHN You believe about the frog ? ABE What 's important is , she believes about the frog . We did n't bring her up to lie . COHN You 'd rather have her crazy than lie . ABE Why is that crazy ? COHN Or hallucinating . ABE Because her mind can conjure with change  --  with ugliness turning into beauty  --  you call that hallucinating ? And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call that reality ? I beg you pardon , Cohn , you 're living in a stacked deck . You give me a choice , I prefer frogs into princes over princes into frogs . p. 9 COHN Even if it 's not so . ABE How do we know ? All I 'm saying is , we do n't know . COHN Do we know that you 're Abe and I 'm Cohn ? ABE In this life . COHN In this life . But in another life , maybe I was Abe and you were Cohn ? ABE It 's possible . Anything 's possible . COHN  --  or that I was Mozart and you were Thomas Jefferson ? ABE It 's unlikely . But it 's possible . COHN  --  or that I was Moses and you were Christ ? ABE It 's possible . COHN Abe , I 'm going to give you a chance to listen to what you just said : It 's possible you were Christ . ABE I did n't say probable . I said possible . COHN And it 's possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ABE All I 'm saying is , we do n't know , do we ? ( COHN rubs the lamp . ) COHN Now we know . ABE I beg your pardon , we know about one lamp . We do n't know about all lamps . Also , we do n't know that a genie did n't come out . We do n't know that there is n't a genie in this room this very moment . And that he is n't saying , " Master , I am the genie of the lamp and I have three wishes to grant you and anything you wish will come true . " Maybe he 's there and maybe we 've been taught how not to see genies in our time . Or hear them . Or take advantage when they offer us three wishes . That 's all I 'm saying . That it could be us , not him . p. 10 COHN Who ? ABE The genie . COHN Abe , if I had three wishes , you know what would be my first wish ? That instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another twenty years , I had somebody with a brain I could talk to ! That 's what I wish ! ( A sudden explosion engulfs ABE . Light and music effect . The smoke clears , and sitting in his place is a bearded WISE MAN in robes . He holds a clipboard and a pen . ) WISEMAN Name ? ! COHN ( Shaken ) Cohn . WISEMAN ( Checks the clipboard . ) That 's right  --  Cohn . Occupation ? ! COHN Musician . WISEMAN ( Smiles . ) Musician . Where are you a musician , Cohn ? COHN At the present I am unemployed . WISEMAN ( Smiles . ) At the present you are unemployed , is that right , Cohn ? COHN Yes . WISEMAN At the present  --  let me see if I have this straight  --  you are an unemployed musician . p. 11 COHN That 's right . WISEMAN Unemployed . But still a musician . COHN Yes . WISEMAN What are you first , Cohn ? A musician or an unemployed ? COHN I do n't understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? COHN Yes . WISEMAN Meaning that he will be on your level . That 's what you mean by intelligent , is n't it Cohn ? ( Waits . ) Well ? Is n't it ? COHN I guess it is . WISEMAN By that we are to assume that you consider yourself intelligent . Or do I go too far , Cohn ? COHN No . WISEMAN No what ? COHN What you said . WISEMAN That I go too far ? COHN ( Inaudible ) No . WISEMAN I ca n't hear you . COHN The other  --  what else you said first . WISEMAN That you consider yourself  --  do n't let me put words in your mouth  --  intelligent . Though unemployed , out of work , a ward of the state , you consider yourself intelligent . And that you want as a companion  --  am I right in this ?  --  someone of equal intelligence . I am not putting words in your mouth ? p. 12 COHN No . Equal intelligence . That 's it . WISEMAN You want another unemployed musician ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who ? COHN Abe  --  my friend . WISEMAN You want Abe ? COHN I want to know where he went . WISEMAN You miss this Abe ? Is he another unemployed musician ? COHN A stockbroker . Mutual funds . Retired . WISEMAN A wealthy retired stockbroker . COHN Yes . WISEMAN Supporting you ? COHN He was sitting in that chair . WISEMAN In my chair ? COHN It 's Abe 's chair . WISEMAN It 's Wiseman 's chair . COHN Who ? WISEMAN Myself . Helmut Wiseman . It is my chair . You see ? I am sitting in it . See how I sit in it , relax in it , lean back in it ? So whose chair would you say this is ? Does it look as if I 've ever been out of this chair ? Conversely , does it not look as if I have always been in this chair ? How tall is this Abe ? p. 13 COHN Five foot eight . WISEMAN He is too short for this chair . You either have the wrong man or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had another height you might have the right man . But it would still be the wrong chair . No , I 'm sorry , I ca n't help you . This is my chair . I , Wiseman . Mine . I know  --  you must have the wrong house ! Try next door . COHN This is my house . WISEMAN ( He refers to his clipboard . ) Whose ? COHN ( Quickly ) Abe 's . Abe and I live here . WISEMAN In this house ? COHN Yes ! WISEMAN Or a house very much like this ? COHN It 's this house ! WISEMAN It ca n't be this house because it 's not the right chair . COHN It is the right chair ! WISEMAN Then why is n't Abe sitting here ? You see , Cohn , your argument collapses of its own weight . I 'm sorry , I would like to spend more time with you , but there are others waiting . Will you send in the next applicant , please ? p. 14 COHN What ? WISEMAN ( Points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you send in the next applicant ? ( A knock on the door . ) You see , they are getting impatient . COHN This is my house ! WISEMAN Your house ? Well , I like that ! Now you see here , Mr. Wiseman  --  COHN You 're Wiseman ! WISEMAN ( Indignant ) Oh ! And I suppose I 'm Cohn ! COHN I 'm Cohn ! WISEMAN Now you 're Cohn . It 's your chair , your house , and your Cohn . Then who am I , may I ask ? COHN I do n't know who you are ! You barge in here  --  WISEMAN Barge in ? Did you see me barge in ? COHN In a manner of speaking . WISEMAN No , I 'm sorry , Mr. Wiseman , or whatever you call yourself , I do n't at all care for your manner of speaking . Your manner of speaking is offensive to me . Now if you had a nicer manner of speaking , something like : ( Sweet-voiced ) " Hello . How are you ? I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that would be another manner entirely . But the way things stand now , the position is already filled . ( Knock on door . ) And tell the others to come back tomorrow . I 'm going to bed . ( WISEMAN rises and disappears behind the curtained doorway leading into COHN 'S bedroom. )  --  A terrible day . I want to leave a call for seven . ( COHN crosses to the doorway . ) If you do n't have seven in stock , make it nine . ( Another knock . COHN turns to the door. ) p. 15 COHN Who  --  who 's there ? JOAN Joan COHN Joan who ? JOAN ( Sings . ) Joan know why there 's no sun up in the sky , stormy weather . ( COHN growls and grabs the poker from the fireplace . ) COHN Enough 's enough ! ( TO JOHN ) Did you hear ? Enough is enough ! WISEMAN Will you kids quiet it down in there ! COHN ( Whirls toward bedroom . ) Wiseman ! ! ( Advances on bedroom with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( He disappears behind the curtain . Sounds of a fight . Curtain moves violently . After a moment WISEMAN skips out , opens the refrigerator , takes out a carrot , and skips back . Throughout WISEMAN 's exit and return the sound of the fight and the bustling of the curtain continue . A moment later , COHN crawls out of the bedroom , his clothes in tatters . He throws open the trunk in the corner and pulls out a shotgun . He crawls back inside the bedroom with the shotgun . A loud blast . COHN staggers out , dragging the dead WISEMAN . Knock on the door . COHN freezes , holding WISEMAN . ) Who 's there ? p. 16 JOAN Joan . COHN Joan who ? JOAN Joan ask me no questions and I 'll tell you no lies . ( COHN drags WISEMAN over to the trunk and with great difficulty manages to squeeze him into it . But not all of him . He pushes down on the head and the legs pop out . He sticks the legs back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for a while until finally all of WISEMAN is in the trunk and COHN slams shut the lid , at which point the side collapses and WISEMAN 'S legs pop out . COHN stares sullenly at WISEMAN 'S exposed legs . Another knock . ) COHN ( Wearily ) Joan who ? JOAN ( Sings . ) Joan sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me . COHN I thought so . ( He folds back the edge of the rug , slides the trunk next to it , then unfolds the rug over WISEMAN 'S legs . He skulks back into the bedroom and comes out with the shotgun . He crosses to the door and listens . During the above we hear the following outside the door . ) JOAN He wo n't let me in . FIRST VOICE He has to ! p. 17 SECOND VOICE Did you tell him who you are ? JOAN No . FIRST VOICE Tell him . JOAN I ca n't . SECOND VOICE Why not ? JOAN It sounds like name-dropping . FIRST VOICE Maybe he has n't heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SECOND VOICE How do you know if you do n't tell him . ( Pause . ) JOAN Knock . Knock . COHN ( Reloads shotgun . ) Who 's there ? JOAN Joan . COHN ( Getting ready . ) Joan who ? JOAN Joan of Arc . ( COHN whips open the door and blasts away . A loud clang . COHN recoils in horror , drops the gun , and backs off . In walks a vision of loveliness wearing a suit of armor . The breastplate has a big black dent in it . JOAN glares at COHN , crosses herself , and starts talking to her body . ) Are you all right ? FIRST VOICE I 'm all right  --  a little shaky . p. 18 SECOND VOICE I 'm upset but I 'm all right . COHN ( Gasping . ) Who are you ? FIRST VOICE That 's some greeting . SECOND VOICE You got any more surprises like that ? COHN Who are they ? JOAN ( Taps the dent in her armor . ) My Voices . ( COHN retreats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shotgun into the bedroom , then turns back to JOAN . ) COHN I 'm not a violent man  --  ( A loud blast from the bedroom . COHN ducks his head behind the curtain and out again . ) FIRST VOICE He 's a pacifist . SECOND VOICE I 'd like to pacifist him right in the mouth . COHN No harm done . Has this been a day ! Look  --  ( Slowly regaining confidence through the sound of his own voice . ) Certain things we know . I 'll make myself clear . We know that maturity is the weaning out of synthetics in one 's life , so that where in one 's childhood , one 's life was a will-o ' - the- wisp , fantasy-laden , hodgepodge , over the years it develops into a spare , clear-eyed , precise , concise , essentially organic whole . Ask questions . I 'm not a pedant . p. 19 JOAN You think life is a hole . Life is holy , not a hole . COHN An organic whole . ( Indicates with motion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . You do n't know what 's important . COHN I do n't shoot people . FIRST VOICE You want to know where the hole is ? SECOND VOICE In your head ! COHN Look  --  ( A long exasperated pause . ) Who are they ? JOAN My Voices ? ( COHN nods . ) They 're my Voices . COHN ( Restraining himself . ) What have you got inside there ? A tape recorder ? JOAN ( Crosses herself . ) You pitiful man . ( Places a hand on his shoulder . ) We must be not our way . Are these rags all you own ? COHN I do n't leave here . JOAN But you must come with me  --  COHN No ! JOAN To see the Emperor ! p. 20 COHN Emperor  --  ( Quickly back-pedals , and bangs into the trunk . WISEMAN 'S legs kick up in the air under the rug . ) I 'll make a contribution  --  ( Reaches into his pocket . ) JOAN I want you ! COHN I live here . I stay here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOAN My mission is to bring you , among others , before the Emperor . It is your duty to follow me . COHN ( Retreats behind curtain . ) You 're barking up the wrong tree . I never leave here . Ask anyone . They never see me leave here . They do n't know me . Ask anyone if they know me . They 'll say , " Who ? " JOAN You must do as I say ! COHN I have to go with you to see the Emperor . What Emperor ? What for ? To tell him the sky is falling ? JOAN The sky is not falling . COHN ( Sarcastic ) Thank God ! JOAN It is missing . COHN ( Comes out from behind curtain with change of clothes . ) What 's missing ? p. 21 JOAN The sky is missing ! We must find the Emperor to give him the wonderful news that the sky is missing and that mankind 's path to heaven is at last unblocked and unimpeded , and that God calls on His Highness , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them two of every kind and blast off for heaven . Before the holocaust . COHN ( Sits her down . ) O.K. ( Pause . ) Let 's take this a little bit at a time . First of all , there 's an emperor , right ? ( JOAN nods . ) And he lives  --  where does he live ? ( JOAN points . ) He lives that way . ( JOAN nods . ) And you are heading a delegation of citizens to petition the Emperor to build a spaceship  --  JOAN A thousand spaceships ! COHN To take us to , you said heaven , am I right ? ( JOAN nods . ) Because the sky which has always been up there is not up there any more . ( JOAN nods . ) In fact , it is missing . And we are to bring this piece of news to the Emperor , this man you call the Emperor . And he is to put two of every kind on spaceships  --  and thus save us from the holocaust . ( JOAN nods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody else dies . Is that a mission or is that a mission ! p. 22 JOAN Do n't be dense ; it has nothing to do with dying . It 's more or less like moving . Some people live in the city and some people live in the suburbs and some people live in the country and some people live in heaven . COHN You do n't have to die to go to heaven any more ? JOAN Not since the sky is missing . You simple move there . But first , of course , you have to know it 's there . For example , if your entire life were spent in the city , would you know about cows and trees ? No ! Well , it 's no different with heaven . True , we may know about it in a religious sense , but certainly not as a place to migrate . COHN ( With infinite patience ) But is n't it cruel  --  maybe cruel is too strong a word  --  is n't it thoughtless to abandon everyone else to the holocaust ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that question . I , too , thought it was cruel , but my Voices tell me that people will never know it 's a holocaust . They 'll adapt themselves . Many may even find happiness . ( Goes to door . ) Are you ready ? COHN Young lady , sit down , I have some shocking news to break to you . ( He sits JOAN back down in a chair . ) There is no Emperor . p. 23 JOAN You might as well say there is no God . COHN There is no God . JOAN You might as well say there is no me and there is no you . COHN There is a me ; that 's all I concede . JOAN But there is no me ? COHN For your information , you are not Joan of Arc . JOAN And my Voices ? COHN There are no Voices . FIRST VOICE There are too ! COHN There are not ! SECOND VOICE Are too ! Are too ! COHN Are not ! Are not ! FIRST AND SECOND VOICES Are ! Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOAN Then whom are you arguing with ? COHN ( Calms down . ) It 's not an argument , just a discussion . I wish you 'd tell me how you do that . JOAN Have you never believed in anything ? COHN I believe in me . After that there 's room for doubt . p. 24 JOAN But it 's so lonely ! COHN That 's my problem . JOAN How can you bear it ? COHN If you 're strong , you can bear what 's true . If you 're weak , you make up fairy tales . JOAN You think I make up fairy tales ? COHN I 'm not singling you out . Abe , my best friend . Him also . He 'd go with you to see the Emperor . Not that he 'd believe . He would n't believe . But just in case . With Abe it 's always just in case . He 's built an ethic out of " maybe , " " who 's to know , " " just in case . " ( In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I much prefer someone crazy like you who thinks she 's Joan of Arc . That at least is a position . So that 's another reason . I have to stay in the house to take care of Abe ; I ca n't go with you to see the Emperor . JOAN We 'll take him with us ! COHN He 's not here . JOAN Where is he ? COHN That 's the question . Vanished ! Vanished to annoy me . You watch . I 'll pay him back good . We had an argument  --  I wo n't bore you with the details  --  but it got around  --  who knows how ?  --  to wishes . Two grown men , an argument over wishes . Abe said it 's possible I had three , I said baloney . Abe said I could n't know unless I wished , so I wished Abe would stop bothering me and vanish , and to make a long story short , in order to aggravate me , he did . p. 25 JOAN Wish him back . COHN If life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . COHN A trick . JOAN Are you afraid ? COHN ( Smiles . ) Afraid ? Of what ? Of wishes ? Of voices ? The only thing I 'm afraid of is insanity . And that 's a losing battle . JOAN I believe in your wishes ! COHN That 's reassuring . JOAN I do ! COHN ( Shakes his head sadly . ) What do you know ? Nothing . No background . I 'll make a bet , no education . What do you have for credentials ? Nothing ! FIRST AND SECOND VOICES Us ! COHN Less than nothing ! JOAN I was once very much like you . COHN ( Enraged ) No one was ever like me ! ( Calms himself . ) Do n't be presumptuous . JOAN I was sad all the time . COHN I 'm not sad . p. 26 JOAN In despair . COHN This is n't despair . JOAN What do you call it ? COHN Realism . JOAN Then why is it so much like despair ? COHN I did n't say they 're not connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel there 's no hope so you might as well die ; with realism you feel there 's no hope but you get a kick out of it . JOAN I wanted to die ! COHN See ? We 're oceans apart . JOAN I lived in a sea of despair  --  COHN Not the same ! JOAN  --  with my wicked stepmother and her two wicked daughters . COHN Wait . You 're confused . That 's Cinderella . JOAN Exactly . COHN You 're Joan of Arc . JOAN Oh , I do n't mean now . COHN You used to be Cinderella ? JOAN Of course ! COHN But now you 're Joan of Arc ? ( JOAN nods , patiently . ) Well , you 're certainly working your way up in the world . Of course , instead of marrying Prince Charming , you get burned at the stake , but you do make sainthood , while all Cinderella gets is to live happily ever after . And in one case Shaw writes about you and in the other case Walt Disney . All in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 27 JOAN Choice ? What choice ? After the ball , I thought the Prince loved me and I dreamed  --  well , no matter what I dreamed  --  he came looking for me , door to door , with a glass slipper . Like a salesman ! Can you imagine my shame ? That he , my true love , would only know me by trying a shoe on my foot ! I walked barefoot on rocks , soaked my feet in brine , anything to fail such a test . But it was never to be made . One door away from ours the Prince was suddenly called to war and I was left with a broken heart and a size-nine foot . So I became a nun . A very poor nun . Night after night , visions of Our Lord came to me bearing a glass slipper . So I fled the nunnery and traveled the land as a migrant fruit picker . I married and begat five Portuguese children .

Half mad with the complexities of it all , I tried again to drown myself , this time by standing on my head and ducking it under the water . But the farther under I ducked , the more the water level receded , until finally , the river ran dry . I knew that it was a sign ! I fell to my knees and prayed God for His forgiveness and that I should prove myself worthy of being His servant . And on the fortieth day my Voices came and told me who I was and what I must do . And now , praise God , I am Joan and I am here ! p. 28 COHN ( Stares at her . After a long silence . ) I really miss Abe . JOAN You do n't believe my story . COHN You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voices ?

COHN I tried once . Look what happened ! JOAN It came true . COHN It did n't come true . Certain things happened  --  I ca n't go into details  --  you do n't know everything  --  JOAN You refuse to wish . COHN Let 's drop the subject . JOAN You do n't want it to come true .

Mind your own business ! JOAN Come ! Look ! COHN Who do you think you are ! p. 30 JOAN Dear God ! He 's dead ! ( Crosses herself . COHN retreats . ) Your friend is dead . COHN He 's not dead .

JOAN rushes to trunk , pulls COHN out by his shoulders , and tries to lift him off his knees . ) Go away . Leave me alone . ( He rises shakily , staggers on the run behind his curtained doorway . After the briefest of pauses , JOAN follows. ) p. 31 JOAN I know what 's on your mind . COHN Go . The Emperor 's waiting . Give it back !

( COHN appears in the doorway . He can not believe his eyes . He starts to collapse . JOAN catches him and helps him to a chair . ABE turns around and sees them . He shuts the refrigerator door and stares coldly at JOAN . ) Company ? COHN You 're dead . ABE ( Coldly ) I did n't know you were having a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He rises , starts to ABE . ) ABE I hope I 'm not getting in the way . I know nobody invited me . I just live here . COHN ( Goes to ABE and embraces him . ) He lives , he breathes  --  ( Holds ABE away from him and stares at him happily . ) He smells ! ABE You 're drunk . COHN ( To JOAN ) Has there ever been such a friend , to rise from the dead in a rotten mood ? I love this man ! ( Hugs ABE . ABE breaks free . ) ABE I beg your pardon . That person ? COHN That 's Joan ! Joan , here 's Abe ! p. 33 ABE I beg your pardon . An old friend ? COHN How old is old ? Ten minutes ? A half hour ? It feels like half a lifetime . It was your lifetime , that I 'll tell you ! ABE Riddles . You invited her ? COHN Not two minutes ago you were dead . ABE You wish . COHN I wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intrigue is going on here .

Look  --  here 's the guest book . Blank , see ? Hundreds of pages  --  wait , here 's the guest  --  no , it reminds me  --  not even a real guest  --  a Jehovah 's Witness . Came in out of the blue . We had coffee , a pleasant chat about religion . Cohn , here , throws a fit . Facts are facts , Cohn . It 's nothing personal , miss . Cohn and I do n't entertain . He agreed and I agreed . When we entertain we differ . It ends up in a fight . So we agreed to live and let live and not entertain . I did n't make up the rule . Now he breaks it . Is this a way to run a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohn , I thought we 'd agreed  --  anarchy is for outside . p. 34 COHN ( To JOAN ) Is that a mouth ? I love that mouth !

( Smile slowly fades . ) You were n't dead . ( Turns to JOAN . ) He was n't dead . JOAN He was dead . COHN How could he be alive if he was dead ? JOAN You saw him ! COHN For half a second .

When I was n't looking ! COHN What before ? ABE Who knows , with a man as corrupt as you ? ! It could have been years ! Who is she ? Why is she wearing that armor ? ! COHN You 're all excited . Calm down . ABE I do n't like betrayal . I beg your pardon . COHN There 's no betrayal . ABE Consorting with the outside . COHN No  --  ABE Spreading false rumors .

I beg your pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fainted , and I have never gotten drunk . Certain things I do not do . I have never done . So you and your chippie , do n't try to pull a fast one . COHN ( Stares hard at him . ) You were dead . ( To JOAN ) It 's the only explanation . He was dead . ABE I did n't faint so I must be dead . That 's logic . COHN Not now , before . ABE How could I be dead before and alive now ? That 's consistency . COHN Wait a minute ! Stop the presses ! Is this my old friend Abe talking ? The very Abe who believes in genies and three wishes and that I could be Mozart and him Jefferson ? ABE There 's no inconsistency . COHN No inconsistency ? ! ABE It 's perfectly plausible that I could die Abe and come back somebody else , but is it plausible that I should die Abe and come back Abe ? p. 37 COHN Is it plausible that you should die Jefferson and come back Abe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same Cohn ? A frog into a prince I could believe . Change ! That 's plausible ! But sameness ! Eternal sameness ! No , I beg your pardon , I ca n't be convinced . COHN ( Exasperated ) I 'm through wasting my breath . ( JOAN crosses to ABE . He backs away . She takes his hand and stares into his eyes . ) JOAN I am Joan of Arc . ABE It 's possible . You could be anybody . I wo n't fight over it . COHN He does n't believe you . ABE It does n't matter what I believe , it 's what you believe . COHN She believes you were dead ! ABE ( To COHN ) That 's her privilege . JOAN You were dead . ABE ( To JOAN ) As far as you were concerned . You never saw me , I never saw you . In that sense I was dead . JOAN I brought you back to life . p. 38 ABE In a physical way ? Well , who knows ? It 's been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  COHN ( Groans and buries his head in his hands . ) It 's not opinion !

( To ABE ) And this time pay attention ! ABE You ask me , is this Abe ? I ask you , is this Cohn ? You believe she 's Joan of Arc ? COHN No doubt about it . ABE And I was dead ? COHN No question . ABE And she brought me back to life ? COHN Believe me , it 's a mixed blessing . ABE ( To JOAN ) Huh  --  must you be able to argue ! COHN I believe in what 's concrete  --  in what I see , until I see something different . That at least is consistent . ( To JOAN ) Are you ready ?

ABE ( Deeply disturbed ) It 's  --  it 's a miracle ! ( To JOAN ) To change Cohn  --  to make him move an inch , not to mention he goes outside , is nothing less than a miracle . Who are you ?

The screen has been moved from the kitchen to a corner near the bedrooms , where it partially hides a sloppily made army cot , in which COHN presently sleeps . Lying across the foot of the cot is a violin , several cookbooks , and the Bible . COHN sits in his chair at the oak table . His head is bowed , his hands clasped , praying . ABE comes out of his bedroom , obviously ill at ease in COHN 'S presence . He crosses to the typewriter , stares at the nearly blank sheet , and punches a key . COHN looks up . ABE , refusing to meet his eyes , turns and disappears into his room . COHN looks heavenward . ) COHN God ? Cohn again . How long ? That 's all I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the scheme of things , one Abe more or less . The suffering I do n't mind .

In no time , out like a baby . I guarantee after twenty years inside , we get him outside . He wo n't leave our side . JOAN ( Disbelieving ) You want me to trick Abe ? COHN Tactics . You never heard of tactics ? All right , you do n't like pharmacology , here 's plan two : While he was inside hiding , he missed a second messenger . A Hollywood offer . Big money . A documentary .

JOAN From the beginning ! COHN The beginning 's too soon for unorganized truth . It needs preparation . You do n't like movies ? Here 's plan three : We 'll say we 're the police , charges have been made but it 's a free country . They 'll have their day in court , they should come with us to appeal before the Emperor . JOAN Cohn , what 's come over you ? COHN You give them a little fear , they get a move on . No dilly-dally . No explanations . The main thing is the mission . JOAN You actually want me to lie ! COHN It 's no bed of roses out there . In me , you 're fortunate to find a man of imagination , but out there , you tell them you 're Joan of Arc , I guarantee it 's no laugh riot . JOAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bricklayers ? Two carpenters ? Two truck drivers ? Two taxi drivers ? Two advertising-agency executives ? Joan . Joan , what am I going to do with you ? It 's a whirlpool you 're walking into . Not even you can walk on whirlpools . It takes fiddling . A story here . A little piece of business there . You maneuver . You manipulate . Push comes to shove , a wheel , a deal , we got ourselves an army . Trust me . JOAN I trust God . COHN No argument . No argument . He gives policy , I carry it out . Where 's the contradiction ?

It is locked . She fiddles with the bolt . By this time , COHN is at the window and fires a blast . ) Very nice ! ( A white flag is poked through the shattered window . ) Do n't shoot . I 'm coming in to parley . ( The door opens . JOAN leaps back . In walks WISEMAN , in robes as before , but with a silver star pinned to his chest . He crosses to the table , sits , puts on a green eyeshade , and begins shuffling a deck of cards . COHN backs off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we play for the girl . ( Looks at them . ) Who plays ?

( ABE does n't look at her . He shuffles the cards . JOAN sits next to him . ABE continues to shuffle. ) p. 61 ABE I 'll give you the answer , you give me the question . Chicken teriyaki . JOAN I do n't understand . ABE I 'll give you the answer . You give me the question . It 's a game . JOAN Oh . ABE Chicken teriyaki . ( JOAN looks at him nonplused . ) You do n't know ? The question is : Who is the oldest living kamikaze pilot ? Here 's another : Nine-W . ( JOAN does n't respond . ) Now you give me the question . JOAN I was n't listening . ABE The answer is nine-W . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABE The question is : Do you spell your name with a " V , " Herr Wagner ? You ready for another ? ( JOAN reaches out to him . ) JOAN ABE ( ABE pulls away . A pause . ) ABE All right , here 's another . The answer is : From birth , I was taught to believe : Where there 's a will there 's a way . But nobody wrote me into his will , so I had to make my own way . Still , I had hope . Someday I would find the right situation . In the meantime , I piled up money . For when I found the right situation . Also I married . A mistake , but bearable . It did n't take too much of either of our time . Whenever we exchanged understanding stares , I found out later it was a misunderstanding . So I wondered : Is this all ? I could n't accept yes for an answer , so I left my wife and I started looking . She sent Cohn to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he wanted to look instead of where I wanted . Finally , we split up . I went on looking . High and low , inside and out , until I got so depressed I could n't hold my head up . So not being able to hold my head up , I saw straight in front of me for the first time . And looking right in my face was the answer . In life you do n't look too high and you do n't look too low , you look straight down the middle . The answer lies in the middle . In the middle there 's always room for hope and not too much room for disappointment . So the lesson of life is to settle . So I came to the woods . To settle . I found this house , I knocked on the door and Cohn opened it . He had settled the year before me . It 's not terrific . But also it 's not painful I do n't hurt anybody . It 's an across-the-board settlement . I do n't love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer , what 's the question ? p. 62 JOAN The question is : If you want to believe in something , ca n't you come up with anything better than that ? ( They continue to stare at each other . ) ABE I beg your pardon . ( Rises , looks at typewriter , punches a key , looks at paper , pulls it out , and crumples it . ) I 'll put it this way . I 'll start . How far I get is another question . JOAN ( Slowly realizing ) You 'll go ? You 'll come ? ABE ( Smiles . ) I 'll accompany .

Everything looks as if it 's been moved and for no particular purpose . Altogether the impression is of impending chaos . JOAN 'S tarnished armor hangs in sections on several hooks of a clothes tree . It is dinnertime . Two pots on the stove give off lots of steam . The dining-room table is littered with dirty dishes . ABE 'S typewriter and stacks of paper are nowhere in sight . ABE comes out from behind his curtained doorway wearing a bathrobe , carrying a half-empty glass of milk .

JOAN ( Turns back to stove . ) The trick is to get the roast and the beans and the cauliflower and the potatoes all done at the same  --  I think it 's ready . ( Opens the oven door . Thick black smoke spurts out , darking JOAN 'S face and sending her into a fit of coughing . She grabs a dish towel and covers her face . Staggering around , she backs into the stove and knocks the pots off. ) p. 68 COHN ( Alarmed ) Careful ! ( JOAN manages to escape the downpour of boiling water and vegetables .

" You take a look . It 's only polite , what could it hurt ? If it turns out heaven , so much the better . If not , what 's to lose ? One more disappointment . In my life that 's hardly an event .

( Lifts her angrily and throws her on the couch . ) ABE Very nice . COHN ( Desperate ) Not one ounce of cooperation from anyone around here . It 's her who 's sick , not me , but does she help ? Fat chance ! No help ! Never helps ! Just faints . Faints ! Faints ! Faints ! You could clock it on the hour . As if she has anything really wrong with her ; do n't tell me ! Hysterical reaction .
