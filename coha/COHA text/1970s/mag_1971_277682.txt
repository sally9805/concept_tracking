BOUND TO VIOLENCE by Yambo Ouologuem . Translated by Ralph Manheim. 182 pages . Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $5.95 . <P> <P> For animals and humans it is fate Either to be victim or the bait . <P> <P> Nothing less savage-or less funny - than Anthony Hecht 's couplet commentary on Aesop , the slave as moralist , should introduce this small masterpiece on man 's ingenious cruelty to man . Yambo Ouologuem ( pronounced Oo-o-lo-guem ) , born 30 years ago in the French Sudan , now the Republic of Mali , writes from the point of view of victim . But what a victim ! <P> Too raging to be merely satirical , too exuberant to be tragic , his first novel ( the first African novel to win one of France 's top literary honors , the Prix Renaudot ) begins as a sort of mock epic outlining in blood red the very real history of an imaginary African empire , Nakem . <P> Ouologuem manages his tableaux with a violent compression of energy , as if he were staging Marat/ Sade played by the Keystone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allah , in the name of Christ , in the name of the god of self-interest , " that precious raw material , the niggertrash " of Nakem is conquered , exploited , then " freed " by new conquerors - Arab , French , even , alas , black . <P> No scene is complete without its obligatory corpses : various Old Massas die from fire , asp and poison ( stomach " exploding like an infernal machine " ) . Sensuality , in turn , has an almost murderous force . Always there are the users and the used . Slave caravans seem to march across the top of every page like an endless frieze . <P> Suddenly the cast of thousands disappears . The brilliant-and clearly well-researched - pageant of 7 centuries of " galloping inhumanity " ( 1202 to 1947 ) drastically slows its tempo . African Everyman becomes specific-one Raymond-Spartacus Kassoumi of a Nakem that increasingly resembles Mali . Nakem 's black rulers have already decided that only slaves will be exposed to corrupt French schooling . Raymond comes of a slave family . He studies hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving an elite-and not so elite-education . To Ouologuem , Kassoumi is the ultimate sophistication of slavery : the black man imprinted with a white soul . African history-and the novel-reaches a supremely ironic climax as Kassoumi , with his white wife , returns to become puppet leader of his emerging Third World nation . The slave disguised as master is a new breed of victim . <P> " After such knowledge , what forgiveness ? " cried T.S . Eliot . At the conclusion of his bloody bloody chronicle Ouologuem does not presume to forgive either blacks or whites . But in the remarkable final chapter-having turned from historian to novelist-he turns from novelist to mystic . " Politics , " he writes accusingly , " does not know the goal but forges a pretext of a goal . " Negritude or colonialism , black power or white power-on these terms , history makes victims , if not slaves of us all . With a skepticism nearly as pure as faith , Ouologuem concludes : one ought to despair of men 's ancient compulsion to rationalize tyranny and " believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That is the way a victim can triumph , even as victim . It is the way Ouologuem at last turns his back on his past-without for a single moment turning his back on life .
