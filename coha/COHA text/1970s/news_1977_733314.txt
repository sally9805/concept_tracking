txt It 's " tree-mendous . " That 's how Kim Kensill describes the " rent-a-tree " program at " Tree-mendous Fruit Farm " in Eau Claire , Michigan . About 150 families are leasing apple trees for $25 to $40 per tree at Tree-mendous . From western New York to Michigan to Washington state , from 50 to 100 apple growers now offer rent-a-tree leases , says a spokesman for the International Apple Institute in Washington , D.C. It was n't so very long ago ? the early ' 60s ? that the pick-'em-yourself trend shot up tremendously , spurred by growers ' desire to cut labor costs and consumers ' desire to get fresh fruit firsthand . But the rent-a-tree business only started to grow in the early 1970s , says Frederick Corey , director of market development of the International Apple Institute . Now rent-a-tree " is enjoying modest , but consistent growth , " Mr. Corey says . // From page 1 Rent an apple tree pick your own Rent-a-tree 's only modest growth stems from a variety of reasons : Some pickers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the whole fall picking season  --  and besides , what if their tree does n't bear as much fruit as a neighbor 's ? Then you have one lessee pitted against another  --  and apples indeed could fly . In western New York an apple grower who leased trees ran into the " problem of policing " the pickers to keep them a safe distance from other leased trees , says Donald Neilson , assistant director of Farmer Products Services of the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets . And for grower Bud Hendershot of Hilton , New York , the slim number of pickers ? he had rented only 800 out of 14,000 apple trees in 1973 ? made him feel he had bitten off the wrong apple marketing technique . He has since closed down his tree leasing operation with con-cider-able relief , and gone back to wholesaling apples . This is not the case ( or bushel ) with " Treemendous Fruit Farm , " of course . One woman who has leased apple trees there for some time now has 11 round , oval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's right , just out of her tree ! The farm does grafting of the varieties . October , National Apple Month , is the peak month for apple picking . Besides traditional varieties such as McIntosh and Red Delicious there are York Imperial , a lopsided apple with a pinkish red and green color , and Jonathan , a solid bright red to dark red-colored apple , generally medium in size ? and " a good all-purpose apple , " according to one advertiser .
