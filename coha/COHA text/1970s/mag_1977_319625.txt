As priests and lay leaders of the million-member Orthodox Church in America gathered in Montreal 's gray stone Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul to choose a new primate last week , the tensions between the church 's old-country past and New World present were plain . The cathedral 's choir insisted on singing in Old Church Slavonic , eschewing the English now used in most O.C.A. parishes . When it came time for the creed , however , one of the visiting priests began chanting hesitantly in English , " I believe in one God ... " Joyously , the entire congregation joined him . Soon after , in a major break with tradition , the church chose its first American-born leader . <P> His full title is His Beatitude , the Most Reverend Theodosius , Archbishop of New York , Metropolitan of All-America and Canada . Theodosius , 44 , was born Theodore Lazor , the son of a Slavic immigrant who worked in a steel plant in Canonsburg , Pa. ( pop . 11,400 ) , for half a century . The election of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed a division between Russian speaking elders and younger members anxious to Americanize the church . <P> Delegates from the 410 O.C.A. parishes in the U.S. , Canada and Mexico nominate a new Metropolitan . If no one candidate receives a two-thirds majority on the first ballot , a second vote is held to propose two contenders ; the church 's rune ruling bishops then choose one of them to be the primate . In 1965 a U.S.-born candidate got the most votes , but failed to gain the necessary two-thirds majority , and the predominantly elderly , Russian-born bishops turned instead to runner-up Ireney , a bishop in New England . In choosing a successor to Ireney , now 85 and ailing , the delegates in Montreal nearly gave a first-ballot victory to Hartford , Conn. ' s , popular Bishop Dmitri , a Texas-born , former Baptist who converted to Orthodoxy as a teenager . But the bishops instead chose Theodosius . He comes from an Orthodox family in the church 's Pennsylvania heartland and thus would be easier for older members to accept than a convert like Dmitri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College in Washington , Pa. , and St. Vladimir 's , the church 's growing seminary in Crestwood , N.Y. , is not fluent in Russian . An open , easy man , whose main passions besides the church are music , gardening and cars , he is more a pastoral than an intellectual churchman . Among other assignments , he revived once-flagging Orthodox parishes in Alaska , where the Russian mother church set up its first North American outpost in the 18th century . <P> One block to Orthodox growth remains ethnic rivalries , especially between the Russians and the larger , New York-based Greek Orthodox Archdiocese . It does not recognize the self-government granted to the Orthodox Church in America in 1970 by the Orthodox patriarch in <P> Moscow . " Orthodoxy has found a new and permanent home " in America , said Theodosius-in English-at his installation last week , but it must overcome ethnic barriers and form a united church if it is to survive and prosper here . -                  @ @ @
