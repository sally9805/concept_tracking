A story by William Saroyan COWARDS OWARDS ARE THE NICEST PEOPLE , the most 11 , -4 interesting , the gentlest , the most refined , the least likely to commit crimes . They would n't think of robbing a bank . They have no wish to assassinate a President . If a ditchdigger calls him a bastard for accidentally kicking dirt into his eyes , a coward does n't feel his honor has been sullied and he must therefore fight the ditchdigger and take an awful beating . He says , " I 'm sorry , I really did n't mean to do that , " and goes about his business . Cowards are decent . They are thoughtful . When the Selective Service Act reached into Armenian Town in Fresno in 1917 , the eligible sons of the various families making their homes there presented themselves to the draft board in the hall of Emerson School and were soon in training at Camp Curry in Yosemite National Park . The government wanted them , who were they to argue with the government ? At this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who lived with his mother and three unmarried sisters in the house at number 123 M Street , who for three years had been employed at Cooper 's Department Store in the menswear department , disappeared . Suddenly it was noticed that he did not leave his house precisely at 8:15 every morning and walk to work , easily the best-dressed man in the whole neighborhood , right down to the pearl stickpin in his tie and the red rosebud in his lapel . Well , of course , a lot of young men in the neighborhood had been drafted and had disappeared , so there was no reason for anybody to wonder about the actual whereabouts of Kristofor . Inquiries about him at Cooper 's were answered by the remark that he was away , which , of course , was true . As for his mother , whenever one of the mothers of the neighborhood who had had one or two sons drafted discreetly , cautiously , and even sympathetically asked about the whereabouts and well-being of Kristofor , saying perhaps , " Ahkh , my dear Aylizabet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work every morning , has the poor boy been drawn into the war by the government , as my Simon and Vask have been ? " Kristofor 's mother said , " Yes , Kristofor has been taken also . God protect him , and your sons as well . " And of course there was no reason for anybody to disbelieve this reply , or to look into the matter further . However , when official-looking Fords and Chevrolets stopped in front of the neat white little house at 123 M Street , and important-looking Americans stepped out of these automobiles and went up to the front door , and then on into the house , everybody in the neighborhood began to wonder what was going on . Was it possible that Kristofor had already lost his life , and the important-looking Americans . surely employed by the government , were calling on the boy 's mother and sisters to break the word gently , and to pay homage to Kristofor for being the first in Armenian Town to give hiE life for the government ? But when a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important-looking people than ever stepped out of the cars , including a man wearing a sheriff 's badge and a revolver in holster , the people of the neighborhood began to suspect that something might be not quite right . ACKING FIGS AT GUGGENHEIM 'S , the mother Aylizabet one day said to her best friend , Arshaluce Ganjakian , " Please try to understand my nervousness . I ca n't sleep , I ca n't rest , for anxiety about my son . We believed he had been taken into the Army , the same as all of our other boys , but they tell us no , he is n't in the Army , so then , my dear Arshaluce , where is he ? It would be a thousand times better if he were in the Army , and sent me a letter once a month . Six months now , and not one word . I can only pray that nothing terrible has happened to him . " " Ah , he 's a good boy , " the friend said . " God will look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere and lost himself in a life of sin . In a big city like San Francisco perhaps , or Chicago , or even New York . I will light a candle for him at church this Sunday and say a prayer , for he is a good boy . " And then , after working swiftly in silence for half an hour or more , to earn perhaps as much as two dollars for a ten-hour day , the friend said , " Or , what 's worse even than a life of sin somewhere , I pray to God he has n't gone to a river and drowned himself , as other young men have done , because they do not believe in war and refuse to be soldiers . Only night before last my youngest , Yedvard , read about such a boy in The Evening Herald . " " Drowned himself ? " Aylizabet said . " In Kings River , " the friend said . " Wrote his note , took off his clothes , and drowned himself . " " Poor boy , whoever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them in Kingsburg . " " Poor dear German boy , how can the govern . ment ask him to kill his own brothers ? " " Nobody can help him , " the friend said . " He 's gone . The police suspected a trick , dragged the river , found his body , and so his people buried him , but nobody went to the funeral except his own father and mother and brothers and sisters . It was all in the paper , which said friends of the family were afraid to go to the funeral , since they are all Germans . " " The poor father , the poor mother , the poor little brothers and sisters , " Aylizabet said . " I love them all , whoever they are . " " Germans , " Arshaluce said . " Enemies . All of a sudden they are enemies , but after the war will they still be enemies ? The boy will still be drowned . Even a life of sin in a big city is better than to be drowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive , at any rate . There is always such a thing as redemption . He can start all over again . He can speak to the Holy Father at the Holy Church and be born again . He can take a nice Armenian girl for his wife and start a family of his own . A life of sin , any life at all , is better than to be drowned , because the war will end , every war ends , and he will still be only a young man . I will light a candle and say a prayer for Kristofor . Do not be nervous about your son , Aylizabet , there is a God in Heaven . " And so the new word in the neighborhood about Kristofor was , " He is gone , he has disappeared , he has written his mother no letter in six months , he may be jiving a life of sin in San Francisco , or he may have drowned himself , remember him in your prayers . " And there the matter stood for many months . AIGUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Arc de Triomphe , and the Tuileries to the nine members of the Sunday School class he had taught at the First Armenian Presbyterian Church , saying uplifting things like , " The streets of Paris are full of men born crippled because of syphilis in their fathers . " And so on . Gissag Jamanakian was killed at Verdun , Vaharam Vaharamian at Chateau-Thierry , and the Kasabian twins , Krikor and Karekin , at Belleau Wood . All under twenty-five years of age , all brought to Fresno from Armenia when they were still babes in arms or small boys . But there were many others , too  --  killed in action in France , in Flanders Field , in Normandy , or somewhere else . A number of unlucky fellows died at Camp Curry of influenza , almost as if they had n't been in the war at all . Two or three went over the hill from that camp to San Francisco , but after a week or two returned , were given medical examinations , and then were only mildly punished . A half-dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Hovsep Lucinian , hit by shrapnel and left for dead in an area under bombardment called no-man's-land , made his peace with himself and considered himself as good as dead when somebody came crawling and dragged him to safety . This turned out to be the one man in his company Hovsep had n't liked , had in fact considered an enemy  --  an Assyrian boy from Turlock named Joe Assouri . They became friends for life , although they had frequent fallings-out , whereupon Joe would shout , " I was a damned fool to risk my life to save yours . " And Hovsep would shout back , " I am only waiting for the day when I shall be able to save your life . After that , forget it . " These outbursts were at poker games , when both men had large families of kids by American girls . Kids who spoke neither Armenian nor Assyrian but kept their names and looked for all the world precisely as they should ? altogether Assyrian and Armenian , but with just a little something unaccountable added . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kristofor 's mother Aylizabet said to her best friend , Arshaluce Ganjakian , " Is it true that the war will soon end ? " " Yes , " Arshaluce said , " Yedvard reads about it in The Evening Herald every night . Soon now our boys will all come home . I shall see my Mihran soon , and you will see your Kristofor , I 'm sure , wherever he is . Have you still had no word ? " " None , " Aylizabet said . " Almost two full years , not one word . " But for longer than a year the whole neighborhood had had word about Kristofor , which they both believed and disbelieved . It came about because of something said by Ash Bashmanian , who , after selling papers every evening , went to the Liberty Theater because admission for him was only a copy of the paper handed to the ticket-taker , and did not leave until after the last show , which for Fresno was rather late , a little before midnight . When Ash got home and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw Kristofor tonight . " After a few minutes his father said , " I was n't listening . I 'm worried about you at the movies every night . What did you say ? " " Kristofor , " Ash said . " I saw him . " " Kristofor Agbadashian ? " " Yes . The Cooper 's menswear man . " " You imagined it , " the father said . " From seeing so many movies . " " No , I saw him . " " He 's been gone almost two whole years . How could you see him ? " " He came back , I guess , " Ash said . " From where ? " the father said . " Was he in uniform ? " " No , he was wearing the same clothes he always wears . " " Where 'd he go ? " " Home . " " What home ? " " On M Street . I saw him go into his house , and I came on home . " " Keep this to yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Just keep it to yourself . You ca n't see straight from seeing movies , and Kristofor is wanted by the government . Let 's forget all about it . You did n't see anything . I 'll give you a dollar . " " I do n't want a dollar , " Ash said . " I sell pa. pers every day to bring home money , to hell out . I wo n't tell anybody , but I did see him . " Somebody else must have seen him , too , be cause it was soon all over the neighborhooc that Kristofor Agbadashian was home . He hac either run away and come back , or he had beer hiding in the house at 123 M Street all the time until finally it had become too much for him and he had taken to going out to walk late at night . " Where 's he been ? " the joke went . " Under the bed , " came the answer . And so , of course , the word of the neighborhood had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if . in fact , it had not also reached Kristofor 's mother herself . A few days after their talk about the probability that the war would soon end , Aylizabet Aghadashian said to Arshaluce Ganjakian , " Arshaluce , my dear friend , I must tell you something on our way home from work tonight , or I 'm afraid I shall die . " On their way home , when she was sure no one else would overhear them , she said , " Kristofor did not go anywhere . He has been home all this time . It is my fault . I told him I would die if he went away . His father died when he was still a small boy . I could not bear to lose the only man remaining in my family . But now what shall I do ? What will happen to him when the war ends and everybody comes home ? It is all my fault , not his , I swear it . Help me . I know I can trust you not to tell anybody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . What shall I do ? What shall we do ? " NOVEMBER 11 , 1918 , the war ended . And 10 that was that , except for the drowned boy in Kingsburg , the dead of the neighborhood in France , the dead from influenza at Camp Curry , and the disgraced Kristofor Under the Bed , as he came to be called by everybody . But nobody looked down at him , and nobody looked down at his mother . Only Kristofor and his mother knew what they had done and why they had done it . Nobody else could even guess . Whatever it had been , however it had been , it was something between themselves and God alone , not the government , which of course had much , much more between itself and God alone . For weeks and months , as the boys of the neighborhood came home and got back into their proper clothes , there was happy confusion in Armenian Town , with only an occasional outbreak of sorrow , and almost always on the part of the strongest men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asked for whom he was crying . since he had had no son in the war , said , " For Kristofor . Crucified for his bravery . Coward he was , no doubt , but how much more brave a man must be to be a coward . It is easy to be a soldier of the government with all of your comrades . But it is very hard to be yourself , all alone under the bed in your mother 's house . I am crying for the bravery of Kristofor . The war is over . Whoever won , won without Kristofor . May God forgive the winners and the losers alike , they each have their dead . May God protect Kristofor Under the Bed , wherever he may be or wherever he may go . " As a matter of fact , several weeks before the signing of the Armistice , he went to Sacramento and under the name of Charles Abbott took a job in the menswear department of Roos Bros. , who soon invited him to take a better job at more money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three years , at which time he opened his own store on Post Street . It was there six years later that the government caught up with him . He was married to a Scotch-Irish girl from Boston , a graduate of Smith , and they had had three sons and a daughter . Two of his sisters had married , one had died , and his mother lived alone in the house at 123 M Street , now and then visited by her daughters and their husbands and kids . The man from the government , who was in his late sixties , by name Battaglia , said , " What we want to do most of all is close out these cases and forget them . You are Kristofor Agbadashian , then ? " " Yes , " Kristofor said , " although , as you know , I have been using another name  --  Charles Abbott  --  for about ten years . I had always had in mind making the change in any case , as my true name is difficult for the American tongue , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nearly the same as Abbott . " " Yes , that 's sensible , " Battaglia said . " A case of amnesia , would you say ? " " No , " Kristofor said . " It was n't amnesia . I hid , in my own house , because I did n't want to go . I knew what I was doing . My mother and my sisters begged me every day to give myself up and go into the Army , but I refused . I have n't forgotten any of it . There has been no amnesia . And my life has proven itself too well for me to feel embarrassed about , or ashamed of , it . In my hometown I 'm still remembered by a handful of very decent people as Kristofor Under the Bed . I am beginning to tell my kids about it , too . So far they think it 's very funny . " " I understand , " Battaglia said . " Under this line , Cause of Failure to Present Self , I have been putting down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine these forms , which is n't very likely . What do you suggest I put on your form ? " " Coward , " Kristofor said . " That would be as inaccurate as Amnesia . " Battaglia said . He wrote in the space , and said , " Father . That 'll do it , I 'm sure . The case is closed . " He left the shop , as if he had gone in to buy something and had n't seen anything that suited him . Cowards are nice , they 're interesting , they 're gentle , they would n't think of shooting down people in a parade from a tower . They want to live , so they can see their kids . They 're very JUNE 1974
