txt A former curator of the Ohio Historical Society says the Love letters of the late President Warren G. Harding " give historians a certain insight into Harding and his times impossible to get any other way . " Kenneth W. Duckett , the former curator , broke the silence he has kept since 1963 when the letters Harding wrote to his mistress were turned over to the society .
