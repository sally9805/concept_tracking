txt A heartsick 43-year-old mother will spend tomorrow away from home , alone in Chicago wondering how many more times her life must be shattered . This is the story of a mother who worked her way thru college and became a college teacher while raising two sons alone . It also is the story of a brilliant law student who never abandoned his loyalty to an imprisoned , dope addicted brother and how that loyalty led to his apparent nervous breakdown and the decision to solve the problem with guns . Both Behind Bars The student and the prisoner are the sons of Mrs. Lois Dotson . Both now are behind the bars of the Cook County Jail . The youngest son , Ozell Hudson , 22 , compiled an impressive I list of accomplishments before his first run-in with the law Nov. 16 , in the Criminal Courts Building . He was apprehended that day bringing two revolvers Into the building . He was charged with unlawful use of weapons , armed violence and an attempt to aid an escape and is being held in lieu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach High School in Savannah , Ga. , young Ozell twice was named to all-city football teams and received the Boy Scouts ' God and Country Award . His leadership and efforts in church work won him a scholarship sponsored by the Presbyterian Mission to the University of Dubuque in 1965 . At Dubuque , Ozell starred on the football team and was named to the all-conference team . Captain of the team , his aggressive play earned him the nickname " Big Oz . " It was during his career at Dubuque that Ozell began receiving letters from his mother in Savannah , telling the problems of an older brother , Lorenzo , now 24 , who had been running with a gang of toughs . " Was Very Disturbed " " We were a close family , " said Mrs. Dotson . " And Ozell took these problems very seriously . He was very disturbed about his brother and the effect it was having on me . " During summer vacations , Ozell returned to Savannah to work as a laborer to help finance bis education . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a summer intern program at the University of Iowa for outstanding students from bw income families . At the end of the summer , he was one of a select group given the choice of attending any law school in the country . " It was a happy day and one of my happiest memories , ' ' said Mrs. Dotson . " He could have gone to Harvard , but he chose the University of Wisconsin . " While Ozell continued to roll up accomplishments , Lorenzo sank deeper into a world of street corners and drugs . He was an addict when Ozell was offered the law school scholarship . Mrs. Dotson remembers the anguish of watching her oldest son become a slave to narcotics . " Just Did n't Care " " I reported it to the police , " she recalled in an interview . " I tried to have him arrested . The police just did n't care . Now they 're all hung up on it because white kids are dying . When it was just among the blacks and that stuff was destroying my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lorenzo walked into a Savannah bank and committed his first known violent criminal act . Hunted as a bank robber , he fled to New York and soon was captured and charged with a bank robbery there . He was convicted and sentenced to 12 years in Sing Sing . Chicago authorities soon began extradition proceedings after connecting Lorenzo with the 1968 murder of a man in the 600 block of East 63d Street . He was returned to Chicago in July , charged with murder and now is in County Jail . The strain was too much for Mrs. Dotson . In the midst of Lorenzo 's extradition proceedings she was hospitalized with a nervous breakdown . " You ca n't imagine how it Ozell Hudson feels to be torn the way I was , " said Mrs. Dotson , a teacher at Georgia Southern College . " I had just so much money to help both of my sons and I had to decide whether to hire lawyers for Lorenzo or keep Ozell in school . " Makes Her Decision She decided to help Ozell and appealed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the decision had an adverse effect on Ozell . Soon after his mother 's decision , Ozell contacted the Society and began doing legal research on his brother 's case . Last summ e r , Ozell was among Wisconsin students who voted to take exams during the summer because of time lost during campus riots . " He sold all of his clothes and other belongings to pay for the summer session , " said Mrs. Dotson . Mrs. Dotson said she noticed a change in Ozell last month when she talked to him on the phone and a letter be later wrote . The letter said in part : " My dearest Mother : " Many times Lorenzo and I have wronged you , not ever realizing the hurt we caused . Our concern for ourselves blinded us to the truth and light that were your gifts to us . " Ready to Act " " . . . only thru your preparation can I hope to be of use to anyone . This is where I am at now . In the past I did in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of direction . My life has been intense and each day I grow stronger in the awareness that I am ready to be . Ready to act . " Less than a month later , Ozell obtained a loan from the student union . He used the money to purchase the two revolvers taken from him in the Criminal Courts Building . " He never had a gun in his life and when I talked to him in the jail he could n't explain what he was doing there , " said Mrs. Dotson . " All he says is that he believes he is the black messiah . " Mrs. Dotson is waiting now . She is staying in Chicago and has made arrangements to get her son admitted to a mental hospital in Savannah if he is judged incompetent to stand trial . Monday night she called home and asked friends to do her a favor . They are going to sell her furniture so she can stay in Chicago a little longer and plead for psychiatric care for " Big Oz.
