txt While it may be a boon to consumers , the bumper U.S. grain harvest already under way poses a big challenge to : ? U.S. farmers , who are having trouble paying off loans because of depressed prices . ? Grain exporters , who claim the Carter farm program lacks any meaningful export-promotion thrust . ? Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland , widely liked personally by farm organization professionals , but increasingly criticized for " bad mouthing " the quality of U.S. grain and for berating the private U.S. exporting system ? and thus possibly hurting much-needed sales abroad . For consumers , of course , the expected huge wheat and corn harvest should help hold food prices down this year to at most a 6 percent rise . But growers are worried . " In Oklahoma farmers are in real bad shape , " says Deputy Secretary of Agriculture John C. White . " Almost 13,000 will have to refinance their loans or dispose of some assets to pay off loans . About one-third ca n't repay their loans at all with the present farm price situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get any more money . " In Kansas an all-time record of 396 million bushels of wheat will be gathered by combines this summer .

" Farmers who bought land in 1973 and 1974 , when wheat prices were $5.80 a bushel , will have to sell out at a whale of a loss , " says Kansas Farm Bureau spokesman Jerry Peterson . To date , Secretary of Agriculture Bergland has focused his efforts on the new farm bill , which would set critical grain loan and target price rates . The President has threatened to veto the Senate version , which would cost the Treasury more than the house proposal and would ' aid foreign underselling of U.S. grain . The House committee version is expected to win full House approval by the // From page 1 What to do with all that grain July 4 recess . Something close to the House bill is thGught likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's signature by Congress 's August recess . Most U.S. farm organization leaders think Secretary Bergland is right in trying to keep the loan-rate-linked floor for grain prices low enough to keep U.S. supplies competitive . But many find him half-hearted or worse in actually promoting exports . Joseph Halow executive director of North American Export Grain Association , has tartly rebuked Mr. Bergland and his department for " continued depreciation of U.S. grain quality and shipments . " In a letter to Secretary Bergland Mr. Halow said : " It has , in fact , been disappointing that in all the dialogue and controversy over proposed farm legislation no one is suggesting anything that could be construed as a positive effort to encourage exports . " Others are more moderate in their criticism . " Realistically , opportunities for export may be limited because of good crops in other parts of the world , " says an Illinois Farm Bureau spokesman .

Mr. Bergland 's critics think he has already been pulled up short by the White House for statements about a possible wheat cartel and sugar supports ? and by the State Department for comments about multinationals during his Japan visit earlier this month . An East Germany agricultural delegation to Washington turned away miffed last week , reportedly feeling Mr. Bergland 's department was not taking them seriously enough . Long-time Washington farm-policy hands see him as holding out for a while , until the chance for a Minnesota Senate seat comes his way .
