txt Mayor Koch proposed yesterday to let the city 's work force shrink by 6,345 jobs by July 1 , 1979 , in a move that he said would help close a $457 million budget gap with no layoffs and no significant cuts in services . The loss of jobs , from a pool of 190,000 workers , and such actions as a change in real-estate tax collections and a cut in the number of ineligible people collecting welfare , is meant to trim $174 million in projected city costs in the fiscal year that starts July 1 . James Brigham , the Budget Director , said at a City Hall briefing that the plan was " designed to minimize the impact , particularly in critical areas . " Labor Leaders Walk Out City labor leaders , who were briefed on the cuts Thursday night , walked out of their contract talks with the city yesterday . They attributed the walkout mostly to the long list of " givebacks " the city asked , but some suggested that the attrition report was an added irritant . Page 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an across-the-board slash , but a series of actions varying by department . The Police Department , as ? disclosed earlier this week , would lose 976 jobs , but " maintain the number of police officers currently performing ' primary law enforcement activities , " the Koch report said . The Board of Education would lose 1,710 , and would make a variety of money-saving changes in the pupil-lunch program , supply system and custodial care . But projected reductions in the pupil population will insure that class sizes need not be increased , the report said . The Fire Department would lose 172 jobs and eliminate permanent manning of three fireboats , The Sanitation Department would shrink by 516 and impose a total freeze on uniformed hiring . The Department of Social Services would lose 1,307 . All of these are net reductions . Deaths , retirements and other voluntary departures would provide a variety of projected personnel cuts , department by department , and the Mayor 's plan involves filling these vacancies only in part . Overall Attrition Rate Put at 3.1 The overall attrition rate would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city projected in January when it gave the first rough estimates of the cuts . The new fiscal year will be the start of a four-year schedule to put city fiscal affairs back into balance and , presumably , end the fiscal crisis that has enmeshed the city since early 1975 . We believe that these redemptions can be absorbed without affeecting the delivery of services , " Mr. Brigham said in explaining the 27-page report submitted to the Emergency Financial Control Board . Mr. Koch , in a taped interview on Channel 9 's " New York Report , " estimated that there were 190,000 people on payrolls in agencies under his control and 100,000 in such nonmayoral agencies as over the schools and the subways and buses . Mr. Brigham said that the proposed job losses had dwindled a bit since the January estimate because many of the cuts were in " departments that have relatively high salaries . " He said , too , that the package had been approved by school officials , who ' would have to absorb the biggest share of the cuts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the departures would come through attrition . " Attrition is about the most painless way of reducing the payroll , " Mr. Brigham said . Here is the pattern , department by department , for the major city agencies af-fected : POLICE : An estimated total of 2,500 would leave between April 1 and mid1979 . The department . would be able to hire 1,524 . But through a variety of actions  --  replacing some police officers now doing desk work with civilians , increasing the use of one-man patrol cars , separating police officers who have been on lengthy sick leave  --  the department hopes to keep the same number on patrol . A 28,430 - member department ( including 24,362 uniformed police officers ) on March 31 , 1977 , would drop to 27,454 ( including 23,386 in uniform ) by the end of next June . FIRE : Five hundred fifty-one employees would leave and 379 be hired . One marine company would continue to be staffed , but perQanent staffing of three others would be eliminated . SCHOOLS : Four thousand one hundred fifty-three employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the expected decline of approximately 35,700 students in the school system , the teaching staff may be reduced by 1,390 witjout affecting clasroom size and programs , " the report said . Besides the payroll cut , the schools would be expected to save $3 million by contracting out some custodial work , $5 million by cutting into supply stockpiles , $2.7 million by cutting the design staff may be reduced by 1,390 without tive changes in the lunch program " without adversely affecting the quality or quantity of the lunches . " SANITATION : There would he 726 departures and 210 hirings , but Mr. Brigham explained that the new personnel would be clerks and other nonuniformed workers . A " major civilienization program " will let the department keep up current service levels , the report said . SOCIAL SERVICES : One thousand nine hundred persons would leave and 412 hired " without any reductions in services to eligible clients , ' the report said . The department also expects to save $14 million by cutting welfare ineligibility by 2 points to 6.6 percent and overpayments by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would save $10 million more . The report also projected savings of $15 million in the interest the city pays on short-term borrowing . This would be accomplished by eliminating the onemonth grace period on real-estate taxes and shifting the first-quarter due date from Aug. 1 to mid-July . The money flowing in would allow the city to borrow $300 million less than it had planned for about seven and a half months . Mr. Brigham said that job cuts into the following fiscal years had not been projected , but that the management improvements should provide continued cash savings in future years . The Mayor proposed that the state make up $200 million of that , which Governor Carey has agreed to , and that the Federal Government $83 million more , which has also been negotiated .
