LOVE FOR LOVE by WILLIAM CONGREVE <P> Congreve was the alchemist of Restoration comedy , refining grossness into gaiety . He gave bawdry rare class . His rakish characters pursue their seductions , cuckoldries and feverish fornications with the aristocratic aplomb of English gentlemen on a fox hunt . Their talk is nakedly lubricious , yet it shimmers with wit . The absolute lack of any sense of sin gives even the most scandalous scenes in Congreve 's plays a pagan air of preadamite innocence . <P> Love for Love displays all these characteristics , and it is difficult to imagine a more delightful revival than that mounted by the New Phoenix Repertory Company . Harold Prince has directed it with a marvelously light touch , and the cast bestows elegance on the incessant sexual innuendo . To unravel the plot would be as tricky as negotiating the Minotaur 's labyrinth , but it remains understandable throughout the evening . <P> Fencing Match . At its core is a mettlesome love story . Laden with debt and disowned by a mean father , Valentine ( Joel Fabiani ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played by Glenn Close . His gallantry is matched by her guile . She tests and taunts him to prove the honesty of his love . He remains steadfast . <P> This amorous fencing match is continually interrupted by a farcical gallimaufry of gulls , lechers , tricksters and cynics . Some of their names indicate their foibles : Scandal , Tattle and Mrs. Frail , a succulent baggage of seeming accessibility who hopes to bed her way to wealth . Thanks to the brushstroke acting skill of John McMartin , the drollest portrait of all is Foresight , a doddering astrologist so fervently absorbed in his zodiacal predictions that he fails to notice that his wife is cuckolding him under the age-old sign of Venery . <P> This season has brought plays of great variety to Broadway . Variety is the spice of life and Love for Love is the spiciest . T.E.Kalem
