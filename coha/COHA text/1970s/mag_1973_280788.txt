Speeding through the Paris suburb of Petit-Clamart early one evening in August 1962 , the French President 's black Citron ran into a barrage of submachine-gun fire . The colonel riding next to the chauffeur yelled to his father-in-law in the back seat : " Father , get down ! " The tall , imperial figure budged not an inch . Again the distraught colonel pleaded : " I beg you , Father , get down . " This time the President leaned slightly forward . A split second later , a stream of bullets ripped through the limousine . When the firing stopped , Charles de Gaulle flicked fragments of the broken rear window from his coat and declaimed : " What , again ? " <P> The Petit-Clamart ambush-the factual starting point of Frederick Forsyth 's otherwise fictional The Day of the Jackal-was De Gaulle 's closest brush with assassins . It was , however , neither the first nor the last . According to a new book published in Paris , Objectif de Gaulle , there were at least 31 serious plots against the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the talking stage . Indeed , even as the would-be killers of Petit-Clamart went on trial for their lives , police averted a sniper 's attempt to shoot De Gaulle with a telescopically fitted carbine while the President was on an inspection tour of Paris ' Ecole Militaire . <P> All the assassination attempts documented in the book-with the lone exception of one by an embittered seaman who blamed De Gaulle for the World War II destruction of the French fleet by the British-sprang from De Gaulle 's decision to grant independence to Algeria . That policy led to the creation of the militant terrorist group known as the Secret Army Organization ( O.A.S. ) , one of whose principal goals was to kill De Gaulle for having betrayed Algrie franaise . The authors , Pierre Dmaret , 31 , who once belonged to the O.A.S. , and Christian Plume , 48 , a journalist , interviewed former O.A.S . leaders and obtained access to the French Interior Ministry 's records . The result is an extraordinary tale of mad zeal , abominable planning and incredibly bad luck by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assassins . <P> The O.A.S . ' s impressive record of failure was racked up with little help from le grand Charles . " You ca n't keep De Gaulle under glass , " he would declare whenever security got too tight . Fortunately for the French President , many of the assassination attempts sound as if they were concocted by Gordon Liddy . One zany plot called for poisoning the Communion Hosts at the village church in **25;2007;TOOLONG , where De Gaulle attended Mass . The idea was discarded after the plotters realized that the first person to receive a Host would keel over dead and give the scheme away . And there was no way to guarantee that De Gaulle would be first at the Communion rail . <P> Equally harebrained was a scheme for a kamikaze pilot to crash a small private plane into the French President 's helicopter . While circling over Algeria 's Blida Airport in anticipation of De Gaulle 's departure , the pilot was dismayed to see that a swarm of helicopters had taken off at once . There was no way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces routinely used dummy planes and juggled limousines as a precaution ) .
