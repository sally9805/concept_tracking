 | Dolly T he first things you notice about Dolly Parton are her elaborately sculpted blonde wigs and her hourglass figure . The first things you sense about the 5 ' 2 " country-music star are the warmth and backwoods simplicity that emanate from beneath the layer of show-business glitter . She speaks with a deep Tennessee accent . There is an uncanny determination in her voice when she says , " It was a long , hard climb to where I am today , but when 1 put my mind to something , there 's no stopping me . " And there never has been . Ever since she can remember , Dolly knew she was going to be a singer . " I began thinking up lyrics before I knew how to write , " remembers Dolly . " So Mama wrote the words down for me . One fine thing about Mama and Daddy is Photograph by RCA Records 54 @# they always let their children hold on to their dreams . At first , Daddy did n't like the idea of me becoming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our poor mountain background making it in the music business , but Mama said from the beginning , I bet you will be a star some clay , honey . ' " When Dolly was seven , her uncle gave her an old mandolin with a few bass strings added and taught her how to play . Then , he took her to Knoxville where she auditioned for a local TV show and became a regular guest . " When I was ten , " she says , " my uncle borrowed a car and drove me to Nashville . I wore a blue silk dress he 'd bought me . We drove straight to the Roman Auditorium where the Friday night Grand Ole Opry broadcast was in progress . I walked right backstage my guitar . " Everybody there kept ing me there was no way could sing that night , but . persisted until a singer na Jimmie C. Newman gave one of his spots . I sang II Y Want To Be My Baby a kept thinking about flat and Daddy and all my broth ers and sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I finished my song . the audience just clapped and clapped like I always knew they would . " With her matter-of-fact views on the inevitability of her stardom , the 10-year-old Dolly Parton was a little disappointed that a record contract did n't follow her debut . She went back home and did n't resume her pursuit of fame and success for eight continued on page 56  | years . The day after her high school graduation she boarded a bus for Nashville . She headed straight for the Country Music Hall of Fame and Music Row , where she sat on the steps of RCA Records with a guitar case full of songs she 'd written , waiting for the office doors to open . " When people would n't listen to my songs , " she says , " I 'd just think to myself , They do n't know yet , but they will . ' " Dolly 's determination to be a star did n't keep her from missing her family back home , or a way of life that would become more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with memories of " the good old days when times were bad , " wistful reminiscences of her parents and their Tennessee mountain home where " life is as peaceful as a baby 's sigh . " " I used to cry myself to sleep at night in Nashville , " she remembers , " but I never thought about quitting . I knew I could n't go home until I had something going . " Born in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee , the fourth eldest of 12 children , Dolly spent much of her childhood without running water , let alone stereophonic sound . " My mother named the last four of her kids Eeny , Meeny , Miney and Henry , " she jokes , " because she did n't want no Mo ! " Sevier County , where Dolly grew up , is tobacco and sugarcane country . Church revival meetings are as much a part of life there as moonshine . Dolly admits there were a lot of strange occurrences in those mountains , and she knows the whereabouts of " many shallow graves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secure and loving family . " My daddy is what dyed-in-the-wool country , " Dolly says fondly . " He did n't believe wom en should cut their hair or wear trousers . He never let any of his go on dates . Not that he was mean , just strict . He did n't like me to wear makeup , so I put Mercurchrome on my lips instead . He was sad as his children grew up and went away . " When I was a little girl , going to the movies was considered sinful in our neck of the woods , " she continues . " But when a movie called Thunder Road ? a true Tennessee story that was filmed right near us and starred Robert Mitchu -- came to town , Daddy said we could go . I was tickled to death , of course , but it also made me feel sad to be there . I did n't enjoy the movie . Up until that night Mama and Daddy were my heroes and it seemed as though they 'd broken their own rule . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had n't . T he break in Dolly 's career came when , after recording songs on a small record label , the popular Nashville singer Porter Waggoner gave her a job on his TV show . Because the two sang a lot of love songs together , people assumed continued on " Do n't laugh ! I 've already lost 300 pounds . "  | they were romantically attached . They are n't . Dolly is married to a man named Carl Dean , whom she met on her first day in Nashville . " I was taking my clothes to the Laundromat when I saw this handsome man drive by . I 'm by nature a friendly person so I waved , " she explains . " He waved back . " That was 13 years ago . Since then , Dolly has become one of the top country-music performers . In 1974 she split from her singing partner Porter Waggoner to go out on own . Then , a few months ago , she let go of her band and fired most of her business-management staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for most part , based in Nashville . " I needed to rearrange things , " she explains , " and get people behind me with dreams as big as mine . I 'm country , but I want to be something more than that too . " Her plans include acting in a movie , writing books and children 's songs and doing more network-television appearances . " I 'm not near the singer I 'm going to be , " says 31-year-old " You could say I have a wild imagination , but my dreams are bigger than most people 's . " To achieve the degree of stardom she has sought since she was a girl in the Smokies singing in the corn fields , Dolly has designed a touring and recording schedule herself that takes her away from home and husband Carl for weeks at a time . She maintains , however that her career has n't and wo n't jeopardize her marriage . " I 've written a lot of songs about heartbreak and love gone bad . Carl and I have never had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dolly says with a smile . " I would n't want to learn ' another m the way I 've learned ' Carl . There is not another man in the world that can give me what I need . " A bit surprisingly , perhaps , Dolly ' husband , who is in the construction business , does n't watch her on TV , almost never listens to her records . and , until just a few months ago , had never seen her in concert . " My music 's a separate part of my life . " she says breezily . " When I 'm with Carl we talk about other things . go for picnics and take long walks . I never wear a wig when we 're alone . I tie my own hair , which is kind of brownish , on top of my head . Carl likes me more natural . " @# @# @#  | Dolly doubts whether they 'll have children because of the demands her career . " I 'm not saying we ca n't do both , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fair the child . I love children so much that I 'd want to be a mother all long if I was going to be one . If Carl and I decide we want a family later on , we could always adopt children . But , remember , I was one the oldest in my family . I 've been raising babies all my life . Some of my brothers and sisters have t own families now , so there 's shortage of kids around our home . Home for Dolly and Carl is not that many miles from the tiny frame house where Dolly grew but it is worlds apart in style . They live in a 24-room mansion outside of Nashville , with peacocks running o the lawn and a stable of horses .. Dolly 's younger sister Rachel , u ha is 17 , lives with them . " My daddy is a little reluctant to venture away from home as he gets older , but Mama visits regularly . They 're proud of me , but then they 're proud all their children . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do , the talk is sure to about the old days , " she says a hit wistfully . Dolly remembers the old days when she performs , too , Under the hot lights , in a white chiffon gown and a platinum wig , she never fails to sing the song that remains her favorite , Coat of Many Colors , about a childhood incident . Dolly plays a simple guitar accompaniment when she sings about the coat her mother made for her from scraps , and of how , as she sewed , her mother told her the Biblical story of Joseph 's Coat of Many Colors , and how the children laughed at Dolly when she proudly wore the coat to school . Now , with patchwork more the fashion than the sequinned costumes Dolly is famous for , she holds fast to a childhood dream of fancy outfits , hairdos and jewelry . She 's often chided for the fanciness of her clothes , as once she was chided for her raggedness . " If people ca n't see behind the hair and the makeup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . want people to like me , but if they do n't , that 's not my problem . I ' ye learned that the best way to please others is to please yourself , and that 's what I 'm trying to do . " ?
