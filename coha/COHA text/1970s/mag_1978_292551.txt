The survivors describe the dementia of Jim Jones <P> He would force a child to eat his own vomit . He banned sexual activity between Peoples Temple members but was voraciously bisexual himself and obsessed with bragging about the size of his penis . He was addicted to drugs and had nurses bleed him and provide him with oxygen for imagined illnesses . <P> These examples of the Rev. Jim Jones ' paranoia and delusions surfaced last week in a 215-page manuscript that was made public by former temple member Jeannie Mills in San Francisco and in further interviews in Guyana with stunned survivors of the mass suicide at Jonestown . <P> After he moved his church from Indiana to California in 1965 , Jones ' mental condition seemed to deteriorate rapidly . In 1973 , eight members fled the commune because of his ban against sex between cult members . Calling 30 associates to his home , Jones declared : " Something terrible has happened . Eight people have defected . In order to keep our apostolic socialism , we should all kill ourselves and leave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not exist at this time . " He did not go ahead with the plan , but from that time on , Jones periodically conducted fake suicide rituals . <P> The ban on sex did not apply to Jones ; he would brag about his own conquests , male and female . He once boasted that he had sex with 14 women and two men on the same day . He claimed that he detested homosexual activity and was only doing it for the male temple adherents ' own good-to connect them symbolically with himself . Some indeed shared his view : the cult 's doctor in Guyana , Larry Schacht , used to brag about having intercourse with Jones . Jones took pleasure in forcing female followers to ridicule their husbands ' sexual ability . <P> Temple Attorney Charles Garry says Jones was obsessed with a custody fight for a boy he claimed was his own . The child , John , was born in 1972 to Grace Stoen , who with her husband Timothy was one of Jones ' top associates . At Jones ' behest , Timothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the child be sired by " the most compassionate , honest and courageous human being the world contains . " The Stoens now deny that Jones was the father and won legal custody of the child last year after a court fight . But Jones refused to let him leave Guyana . Just before Jones ' death he told a newsman that the fear of losing the child prevented him from returning home . After the suicides , the child was found dead next to Jones ' body . <P> Jones first visited Guyana in 1962 on his way to Brazil , where he lived for two years . When his paranoia , fueled by unfavorable press reports , led him to move his community from San Francisco in 1977 , Guyana was a logical choice . Its socialism matched what he conceived to be his own communal-agrarian ideals .
