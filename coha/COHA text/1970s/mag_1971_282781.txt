Yemen 's Major General Hassan Amri had long been noted for his sulfurous temper , and his desk-pounding rages frequently sent aides fleeing from his office in terror . But despite his reputation for hotheadedness , the gruff general , 48 , had managed to become Premier of the primitive Arab nation no fewer than seven times since 1962 , when nationalist forces supported by Egyptian troops overthrew the conservative Moslem imamate. * Now , however , Amri 's temper has apparently cost a young Yemeni shopkeeper his life and Amri his job as Premier and commander in chief of the armed forces . It is unlikely that he will ever again hold high office in Yemen . <P> Fatal Mistake . The bizarre string of events that led to the general 's downfall began one afternoon late last month when he picked up his phone and dialed his guards commander . Somehow the wires got crossed , and Amri broke into a conversation between Mohsen Harazi , who owned a small camera shop in the capital , San'a , and a friend . Thinking that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Premier . Harazi , thinking that his friend was playing a joke , laughed . One thing led to another , and soon the two were trading insults . <P> Amri , enraged by such impertinence , demanded identification , and Harazi made the fatal mistake of giving his name and address . Minutes later , soldiers poured into his shop and dragged him to general military headquarters . There , as Amri watched , guardsmen beat him with iron rods . Harazi pleaded for mercy to no avail . When the guardsmen refused Amri 's order to kill Harazi , said reports from San'a , the Premier picked up a gun himself and shot the shopkeeper in the head . <P> Word of the summary execution quickly spread throughout Yemen . Harazi 's family refused to bury him unless action were taken . President Abdul Rahman Iryani , a frequent rival of General Amri , reportedly wanted to try the general for murder . So did many members of Yemen 's first elected legislature , the 159-member Shoura Council , which was installed last April . " Killing people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ali Saif Kholi . Many of the legislators were still angered over Amri 's strong-armed attempt to dissolve the legislature only the week before . <P> Flash of Temper . Amri 's army friends succeeded in having him exiled instead , and a few days later the general turned up in Beirut with his twelve-year-old son . Sources who have seen him say that he seems subdued and regretful . But the old temper still flashes , and he was about to smash a Beirut photographer 's camera at the mountain resort where he is staying when the Yemeni ambassador stepped in and cooled him off . <P> Though Amri insisted he was in Lebanon for " rest and medical treatment , " President Iryani , whose own powers are greatly strengthened by the general 's removal , promptly announced Amri 's resignation as Premier and commander in chief . In the past , the wily strongman 's usual tactic when opposed on one issue or another was to resign , repair to Beirut or Cairo for a few weeks , and await recall on his own terms .
