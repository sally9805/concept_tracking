txt The Federal Government will soon tell the automobile industry to come up with virtually pollution-free engines by 1980 , Edward N. Cole , president of the General Motors Corporation , said today . In a speech to a convention of the Society of Automotive Engineers here , Mr. Cole said that such an assignment would not be easy but that it could be done . " We have already demonstrated in our laboratories that these improvements are technically feasible , " he said . " As a result , it is my opinion that the gasoline internal combustion engine can be made essentially pollution-free . This is a goal to which General Motors is devoting extensive resources and we are confident it can be achieved . " Mr. Cole called for regulation of gasoline composition as well , making fuels less volatile and eliminating lead addititives . The automobile makers have become convinced that part of the auto pollution problem can be solved by modifying gasoline composition , a move oil companies resist because of costs tied to changing their refining processes . Mr. Cole said General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welfare , would soon issue new automotive emission goals under which , by 1975 , the hydrocarbon , or unburned gasoline , fumes would have to be reduced by 95 per cent , the carbon monoxide fumes by 85 per cent , and nitrogen oxide fumes by 75 per cent . " The proposed H.E.W . goals for 1980 would require that the allowable emissions in each of these categories be reduced by more than 50 per cent compared to 1975 , " Mr. Cole said . His emphasis on cleaning up the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine was probably an effort to head off attempts to ban the engine and force the auto makers to produce electric or steam-powered cars . In California a bill banning the gasoline-powered engine passed one house of the state Legislature last year before it failed . Just last month , Henry Ford 2d , chairman of the Ford Motor Company , called pollution Detroit 's most serious problem in the coming decade and pledged engineering manpower and millions of dollars to help solve the problem . One-Up on Ford Mr. Cole went one up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially pollution-free " cars in a decade . In urging regulation of gasoline composition , Mr. Cole noted that reducing volatility and eliminating some present-day components of gasoline could " bring immediate reduction of emissions in all cars ? new and used " and have . " marked benefits " in curbing smog . General Motors developed tetraethyl lead , which is used in most gasolines to improve engine performance , but today some scientists consider it a harmful pollutant . Removing it from gasoline would also curb hydrocarbon emission and make new antipollution devices workable , Mr. Cole said . The use of unleaded fuels could hurt engine performance , meaning cars would be more difficult to start and run , but that could be offset , Mr. Cole said . " It is urgent that those most concerned with these problems ? the Government , the automobile manufacturers and the petroleum refiners ? give top priority to the resolution of these issues , " he said . " It is particularly vital that efforts be made as quickly as possible to establish specifications for fuels with reduced pollutant characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date ? such as 1975 . " He continued : " This is a critical requirement if the petroleum companies are to have adequate time to make necessary changes in the composition of motor fuels and the automobile companies have sufficient time for design , testing and tooling requirements of modified power systems which can operate satisfactorily on these new fuels . " A conflict between the automakers and the gasoline companies erupted last year when General Motors researchers announced that cars could run on less polluting fuels . The gasoline companies said they could not run well enough and complained about the cost of such changes . The G.M. president also endorsed the idea of the air bag safety device , an inflatable cushion that pops up to catch a car occupant in a crash . But he said problems , such as keeping the bag from inflating accidently in a car and causing an accident , or inflating accidently in factory , still were unresolved . Ford Laboratory Planned DETROIT , Jan. 14 ( AP ) ? The Ford Motor Company , which announced recently that it would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said today that it would build a $7.5-million carburetion engineering laboratory in suburban Dearborn as part of that program . Construction is scheduled to start in March and the laboratory is expected to be completed a year later . Trade Group Comments I The national trade. , association of the . petroleum industry said last night that " oil companies will carefully study proposals made by the president of General Motors in which he called for consideration of changes in fuel composition , as well as engine design and control systems , to further reduce automotive air pollution . " P. N. Gammelgard , vice president for environmental affairs of the American Petroleum Institute , said : " Any fuel modification that can be shown to achieve a substantial reduction in pollution from the automobile at a reasonable cost to the public would , I am sure , receive support from oil companies . " Mr. Gammergard said he agreed with Mr. Cole that pollution from internal combustion engines could be controlled .                  @ @ @
