Of all the quixotic ventures that a young business man could dream up , the farthest-out would seem to be making automobiles . It has been 28 years since an American started an auto-manufacturing business from scratch - and that was a disastrous flop for Henry Kaiser . So meet Don Quixote - in the form of flamboyant Malcolm Bricklin , 35 , a Phoenix , Ariz. , resident who wears studded denims and bedecks himself with silver-and-turquoise jewelry . <P> Bricklin insists that he will start assembly next month of the first North American-production car to be engineered with safety as its prime concern . <P> A college dropout , Bricklin followed his father into the construction business and made his first after-tax million before he was 22 . Later he founded Subaru of America Inc. and profitably distributed the tiny Japanese-built autos . He has rounded up $20 million in backing , much of it from Philadelphia Banker John R. Bunting and from businessmen in New Brunswick , Canada , where the new car will be made for export to the U.S. <P> The project , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from GM , Ford , Chrysler and American Motors to design a car that would handle well yet meet all federal safety and antipollution standards . The car , which looks something like a Maserati , has such safety features as a sensor device to prevent the car doors from closing if a passenger 's hand gets in the way . Bricklin considered some 4,000 suggestions for a name , then insouciantly decided to call the car - what else ? - the Bricklin.
