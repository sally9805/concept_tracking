Housing is one of the keys to the U.S. economy , because its fortunes affect the sales of lumber , steel , furniture , appliances and many other products . For the past two years , it also has been just about the sickest of all American industries . Last week it finally began flashing signals of a recovery , albeit a modest , slow and uneven one . <P> In May the number of housing starts rose 14% from April , to an annual rate of 1,126,000 . That was the first significant upturn after a shocking plunge . From an annual rate of about 2.4 million in 1972 , housing starts had nose-dived to a yearly pace of only 880,000 by last December ; in the first four months of 1975 , starts stayed flat at a bit below 1 million . Carla Hills , Secretary of Housing and Urban Development , said that the May figures " seem to indicate that a recovery is under way . " <P> Checkered Upturn . Building experts quickly added : Not much of a recovery . The May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowest for any May in 28 years . In addition , the pattern of the upturn is highly checkered . Single-family home construction is picking up on the Pacific Coast and throughout the Midwest , but in the Midwest , at least , the market for apartment buildings remains slack . In the South the recovery has not been felt at all . <P> Still , some upturn is better than no upturn : housing is at least ceasing to be a drag on the national economy . The budding upturn will probably reinforce President Ford 's determination to veto this week an " emergency " housing bill passed by Congress two weeks ago . The bill was designed to encourage the building of 400,000 new houses mainly by providing mortgage subsidies to middle-income home buyers . But it probably would have no effect until well after the slump was ended . <P> Lofty Rates . Economists expect housing starts to increase to an annual rate of about 1.4 million by year 's end . Mortgage money is now plentiful , and the national average interest rate on single-family home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to 8.9% , from 8.96% in April . But in many areas , notably the Southeast and the West Coast , the rate hovers above 9% and is not likely to drop much as long as interest rates on competing investments , like corporate bonds , stay high . Hence prospective home buyers have little reason to wait , since prices are sure to rise and interest rates to remain lofty . <P> Other economic indicators released last week showed a similar mixed and hesitant pattern . Industrial production continued to fall in May for the eighth consecutive month . But the rate of decline-only .3%-was the same low figure as in April , suggesting that the recession is ending . Personal income , a buoyant factor that has been rising for six months , scored its biggest monthly increase since last September . <P> The battle against inflation also continues to progress well . Despite markedly higher meat and gasoline costs , the consumer price index showed only a slight .4% increase in May , holding the annual inflation rate to a manageable 4.8% . The combination of higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real consumer purchasing power is rising . That is likely to lead to an increase in consumer buying , which will be the major factor in lifting the economy in the months ahead .
