Betty Ford is certainly the most celebrated First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt . Even those who do n't like her views or her casual manner join the majority of Americans who agree that Mrs. Ford has captivated the public in a most astonishing manner . After all , for one whole generation Betty Ford was known only by a relatively small circle of friends and Republican campaigners , and was not the kind of person who sought or received big attention . She might have continued that way as the First Lady  --  as much as any First Lady can  --  were it not for her naturalness and candor , which the press , and therefore the public , suddenly discovered about two years ago and which won her even higher approval ratings than her husband , the President . It is not remarkable that a full year before the upcoming election , blue-and-white buttons popped up reading : " Betty 's Husband for President in ' 76 . " The quick explanation for all this fascination and popularity is that Mrs. Ford spoke her mind with startling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said that she " would n't be surprised " if her eighteen-year-old daughter , Susan , decided to have an affair , allowed that premarital sex with the right partner might lower the divorce rate and remarked that she assufned all her children had tried marijuana ( they had n't ) . Never had a First Lady been so outspoken , and seldom was there such a reaction to an interview with a famous person in the White House . The first wave of criticism crashed in , causing Mr. Ford 's political soothsayers to fret and wring their hands . Americans who believed in old-fashioned values and virtues were outraged with Betty Ford . But then came the second and third waves , bearing sounds more pleasing to the Ford family . The people who wrote in , after thinking , were more inclined to agree with Betty Ford that parents who went through the struggle of rearing children during the " youth revolution " were familiar with the problems of sex and drugs . While these concerned parents were not changing their own standards , they also knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In such a situation , the best course for a parent was to be available and understanding . The " Sixty Minutes " flap was n't the first time than , Betty Ford caught the attention of the Washington press corps . Her husband was hardly installed in the vice-presidency in 1973 , when Betty discussed her treatment by a psychiatrist and the fact that she took Valium or Equagesic three times a day . " That way I 'm more comfortable , " she explained . " Otherwise , I find that I become tense when I realize how much there is to do in one day . " She had also made it clear that she supported the 1973 Supreme Court ruling for liberalized abortion , saying that she was glad to see abortion " brought out of the backwoods ; and put in the hospitals where it belongs . " She was and is a firm supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment , and critics claimed she was using the White House telephone to lobby for E.R.A. Betty Ford never hides her affection for her husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once , a network TV camera caught the President giving her derriere a gentle pat . She told an interviewer that reporters had " asked me everything but how often I sleep with my husband . If they had asked me that , I would have told them , ' As often as possible . ' " And , when Ford became President , Betty moved their king-size bed into the White House , and there were many letters , in Betty 's words , " from people who feel it is very immoral for us to be using the same bedroom . I guess if you 're president , you 're supposed to become a eunuch . " She was just as lively when talking about her breast operation . " For those who have gone through it , " she said , " I do n't see anything so great about it . All you need is a little foam rubber . " Then she said she would cooperate with the doctors because she wanted to live as long as Alice Roosevelt Longworth ( ninety-three ) , the daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , " said Mrs. Ford , " and make all those funny remarks . After all , she 's topless , you know . " Mrs. Longworth had two mastectomies and jests about being Washington 's oldest " topless " woman . Somehow , at a time when America seems to be turning its insides out for the world to see , for better or worse , Betty Ford 's openness has great appeal . In the past thirty-five years , only Eleanor Roosevelt exceeded her in popularity . Where Bess Truman was a down-to-earth woman who was frank to ac knowledge that she would rather be hack in Independence , Missouri , she did not offer other observations which would have put her on center stage . Mamie Eisenhower was a sweet , devoted wife , who came off as many a matron 's Tuesday afternoon bridge partner . Jacqueline Kennedy was the ephemeral Queen of Camelot , come to tragedy , and more fascinating than popular . Lady Bird Johnson was greatly admired , and was discovered to be a great and enterprising lady in her own right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her successful goodwill tours to other nations , particularly Africa . Even with Watergate , Mrs. Nixon remained high in the ranking of most admired women . Though Betty Ford achieved popularity by expressing views and an openness which seems to set her apart from that wide spectrum of American women who do n't wind up on " Sixty Minutes " or the " Johnny Carson Show , " in reality , Betty Ford , as wife and mother , is more conventional than most people think . After her uncomfortable experience with " Sixty Minutes , " she was quick to point out that she considered herself a responsible , loving parent , who wanted her children to discuss their difficulties with the people in the world who cared the most  --  their mother and father . And she added : " My husband and I have lived twenty-eight years of faithfulness in marriage . I do not believe in premarital relations . But I realize many in today 's generation do not share my views . " When I interviewed her in a parlor setting in the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " The turmoil over that interview is way behind us , " she said . She was more interested in talking about how the candidates ' wives were freer to speak their minds this election year . She seemed particularly proud of that , and a press notice in the New York Times saying that " Betty Ford 's frankness " was one reason the wives were being asked tough questions about the issues . In the historic treaty room Betty Ford makes fashion history . " She 's so pretty , " says a friend , " the press was surprised to learn she has a brain too . " And though she is identified with controversial issues , Betty Ford and her setting seemed proper middle-class . She wore a simple gray flannel dress and a white silk blouse . There was a scattering of women 's and home magazines and orange-peel candies on the table . There were a number of plants , two vases of red roses , and a bizarre lamp nested in a green plant  --  the lamp lighting when a person touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all very conventional . There is something about Betty Ford , her husband and family which makes people think of the family-situation programs on television . Thus , they are quite American bourgeoisie , and a handsome family as well . " I think that we represent middle America , " she says , " not only because we come from Michigan , but because we are a family of four grown children , each with a different career which people can relate to . As a matter of fact , Jack 's decision to announce that he had tried marijuana was a great relief to many parents because they then said , ' Our children are n't perfect either , they 're normal . ' " Our son Michael , who is in divinity school , has a different view from Jack 's . However , Michael has friends in college who used marijuana and that had nothing to do with their relationship . " You know , I really do n't expect Susan to come and tell me that she 's having an affair because , well , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . If she is , she 's having a lot of them . Laughter . In fact , if she goes with a boy and he brings up marriage , she drops him because she really likes to play the field . That 's good . I want her to have a career first . Our real problem with Susan is trying to find a man tall enough for her . ( She 's five feet , eight inches tall . ) " Anyway , we definitely got mail sympathetic with my point of view . There is a lot of that thinking out there still . You learn this when you are out campaigning . " Betty Ford claims that she refrains from hashing over the perplexities of politics with her husband when he comes to the living quarters section of the White House in the evening . She makes an effort to relax him before dinner . " We 've been married twenty-eight years now , " she says , " and I can always sense his attitude , and whether he 's had a good day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I make a point not to , and I do n't go into matters like how his schedule might be conflicting with mine . Or even on something like we 're getting our Virginia house painted , and that there are problems with it . I think it is a sensitivity thing between two people who have lived together for a certain period of time . He would n't bring up anything to distress me either . " He particularly enjoys music at dinner . One of his favorites is Oklahoma ! , though I get a little tired of it . He likes musicals , but on the light side . He does n't carry his troubles with him . He does very well at leaving the office behind . " He loves to eat . I feel sorry for him because he really loves food , and he has to hold back . I tend to kid him facetiously about that . I do n't eat dessert , but he does . He likes butter-pecan ice cream every night , though he sometimes eats other desserts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His interest lies where they are and what they are doing . It 's a family hour . Susan and Jack are often there for dinner , too , since they live in this area . That pleases him more than anything else . " After dinner , my husband and I usually go to what we call our ' room . We just moved everything from the room where we kept all our junk in our Arlington home to a room here . It has his old leather chair , his footstool and the pipe rack . We kept all the pictures taken of the children over the years which he kept on the mantel . He was so fond of that . We have Susan from yea-high to where she is now , and that 's tall . " We often watch television , some sort of detective story . We like Angie Dickinson ( Police Woman ' ) and Bill Conrad ( ' Cannon ' ) . I call it ' escape hour , ' situations where he can escape . He does some work while he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband smokes a pipe  --  it 's the least detrimental . If you are going to smoke something , smoke a pipe , according to the experts . Susan smokes . I wish she would get a really bad case of bronchitis and a sore throat , so she could n't smoke for six weeks . She wants to cut down . " But Mrs. Ford initiates no plans for those children of hers who smoke ( Susan and Jack ) or herself to take one of the several courses designed to end the smoking habit . She occasionally asks them if they would like to do something , say , join the family for a weekend , but she is firm in her idea that they are grown and parents should " not try to influence their decisions on life . " Betty Ford says : " I brought them up , and when they were eighteen and graduated from high school , and off to college , I said to myself , ' If I have n't had any impact on their lives by now , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's twenty-four , and while he lives at the White House , I do n't check him in and out . He had a difficult time locating a job because he was graduated in forestry . That 's a field closely connected with government . When they find out that he 's the son of the President , they say , ' Well , sorry , we ca n't take you . ' But Jack has a good job now with a youth travel service . " The youngest son , Steven , twenty , is a student at California Polytechnic University , and he spends a good deal of time on horse farms or in wilderness areas . " His field is horsemanship , and he wants to acquire or manage a ranch . There 's a difference between managing and acquiring , so in the meantime he may have to work as manager in order to get the money to acquire . " Michael , twenty-six , is the eldest and only married son . He is the least likely to be read about or seen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer the privacy they have as students at Gordon-Cornwell Theological Seminary , at Essex , Massachusetts . Mike sounds like the family 's conservative . He is against liberalized abortion , premarital sex and marijuana . " I would certainly say that Mike knows where he 's headed , as far as his religious training is concerned , " Betty Ford says . " I think that he 's mainly interested in working with young people not as much as a minister but more as a consultant . He will take his divinity degree , though . " Mike has found his salvation . He 's found his field , and he has a wife . He used to say that he would n't marry until he graduated and could support a wife . But fortunately he did marry , and they 're very happy . " Mike and Jack are only two years and two days apart , and there was a great deal of sibling competition when they grew up . We putthem in ski lessons together , and the rivalry was so great that we had to separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time . " One thing I could never understand about Jack and Mike is that they shared a room all those years and one was very neat and the other dropped everything where it came off . I wo n't say which was which . So one sort of drew a line down the middle of the room , and said , ' That 's my side of the room and the other is yours . I like the way my side of the room is . ' I ca n't think of two more opposite children . " Of all the four children , Susan is closest to Mrs. Ford now . Susan , nineteen , lives in the White House and seems to alternate between college and jobs . She has worked as a photographer for the Topeka ( Kansas ) State Journal , the Associated Press ( Washington ) and now Time magazine . Betty Ford keeps a close eye on Susan , who was somewhat embarrassed by her mother 's spontaneous opinions on her love-social life . Susan , at the time , said her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people should talk about . " Susan said she did n't have anything of this nature to discuss with her mother " yet . " According to Betty Ford , Susan is still thinking about what she wants to do with her life . She explains : " Whenever Susan talks about marriage and says she is going to havetwelve children , I say , ' Wait until you have the first one . ' " Betty Ford claims she was a " natural mother , " and that if she had to do it all over , she would still have had all four . " I enjoy each one as an individual , " she says , " and they are so completely different . We tried very hard to have them develop their own individuality . We did n't want them in a mold . " Betty Ford bore her four children within seven years . Moreover , with her husband constantly out on the speech and fund-raising circuit for the Republican Party , she was pretty much left the chore of rearing these four youngsters . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for Betty Ford . One day , back in the mid-Sixties , she strained to lift a kitchen window and suddenly felt an excruciating pain in her neck . It turned out to be a pinched nerve , and regular medical treatment did little to relieve the pain . Valium and Equagesic began . The next stop was the psychiatrist , and those weekly visits spanned eighteen months . " I did n't lie on a couch or anything like that , " Betty Ford once told an interviewer . " I 'd just sit and talk and it seemed to help . After all , if you have an abscessed tooth , you go to the dentist , do n't you ? This was during the time that Jerry was away so much , and I needed a sounding board to talk to . Somebody had to tell me what that doctor did : that I should n't just live for my husband and children but ought to do something for myself , too . " Betty Ford changed her ways somewhat . She went back to modern dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued the rigid discipline , but she laughed off some of the happenings which had made her tense . She quit worrying about how the furniture took a beating from the children . She thought it was funny that a snake and alligator found their way into the bathtub . " The furniture survived , " she said . " When they got older , I had it reupholstered . When nobody else would let their children build a but in the yard , a little shanty , I allowed all the boys to use our backyard for one . They built a shanty with windows and a door , and of course , little sister Susan was not allowed in . I helped them make curtains for it . It had class . You could stand up in it . " When the going got rough , Betty sometimes went to the bathroom to read . " The children would be downstairs and wonder why I was up there so long . I just read and read , and after a while they became quiet , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years that tried her spirit . She had no qualms about speaking to the National Association of Mental Health convention in 1974 after she accepted the chairmanship of that organization 's fund-raising campaign . " This is a red letter day for me , " she said proudly . " As you know , I had psychiatric care and it did me a lot of good . " The audience cheered . Still , Betty Ford is a religious person . All her life , she has read the Bible daily , often with her husband , and sometimes praying with him afterward . She taught Sunday School at the Episcopal church attended by the Ford family . But it was after her cancer operation that Betty Ford felt what she called " a real awakening . " " I thought that I had been searching for something in the Bible and in my religion during my whole life , " she said . " But I never reached it . When I came through this , I thought that I was really a child of Christ . To have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I had to go through to reach it . " Betty was born Elizabeth Bloomer in Chicago , April 8 , 1918 . When she was two , her father , a manufacturer 's representative , moved the family to Grand Rapids , Michigan . Young Betty was nicknamed " Betty Pants , " and she had no qualms about hitting small boys who taunted her this way . She was lithe and athletic . When she was eight , she was enrolled at the Calla Travis School of the Dance . It soon became obvious she was gifted in dance , and at fourteen she was an assistant instructor at the school . Then , two years later , in 1934 , her father died . He left enough means for the family to continue , though Betty 's older brother , Bill , helped support the family . When Betty was in high school , the University of Michigan 's star football center was Jerry Ford , and when Betty went off to Michigan games , she noticed that he tense Bloomer was a woman who would allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She visited Betty in New York , told her about who was marrying whom , and begged her to come home . According to Betty Ford , Martha Graham wanted her to remain in New York because she was close to becoming quite good . But mother prevailed . Betty went home for a six-month try at Midwestern life . She became fashion coordinator at Herpolsheimer 's De partment Store and also taught dancing to underprivileged children . Occasionally , she went to New York to check on the new fashions , but that city 's hold on her was gone . Betty , by all accounts , had an Continued on page 120 was from Grand Rapids . He was five years older than Betty , and she did not know him then . After graduating from Central High School in Grand Rapids , Betty went off to Bennington College , mostly because it offered study in the dance . Bennington was regarded as an avant-garde school then . It was ahead of its time in offering courses in the creative arts for young women and in encouraging them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty wild reputations , " Betty Ford says now . " It was a very new school when I was there and much different from traditional colleges . Sarah Lawrence was the only other girls ' school which offered courses in the dance . " She studied at Bennington two summers before the family funds for her education ran out . Then , at twenty , she went to New York to try for a career in the dance . She signed on with Martha Graham and found an apartment in Greenwich Village . But her mother did n't approve of Betty living in a Bohemian atmosphere , so Betty and a former college roommate found an apartment in a less lively part of Manhattan . Martha Graham became Betty 's idol . " More than anyone else , " Mrs. Ford says , " she shaped my life . I think that 's what I saw in my husband years later  --  the same drive to perfection , only for him it was first football , and then his work . " Studying under Martha Graham was hard work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall on occasion . She also developed a yen to become a model and was thrilled when John . Robert Powers , whose model agency was then tops , signed her on . She appeared in fashion shows and says she felt pretty good about it . Meanwhile , Betty 's mother back in Grand Rapids was sending pressure messages for her to come home , get married and settle down . Mrs. Horactive social life back in Grand Rapids . Then , during World War II , she married William Warren , a furniture salesman . It was not a good marriage and was over years before they divorced in 1947 . She was awarded $1 a year alimony and the furnishings for their apartment . " It taught me , " Betty Ford once said of that marriage , " that there are some people you just ca n't change . " She has lost all track of William Warren . Betty Ford was introduced to Jerry Ford , a handsome , blond lawyer , with an admirable record as athlete and Navy officer . He was thirty-five and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Ford broke into politics by winning an upset in the Republican primary and defeating his Democratic opponent in November . She had worked in his campaign , mailing literature and telephoning voters . They were married before election day  --  on October 15 , 1948 . Ford had been out all day campaigning , and while he changed to pinstripe suit for the ceremony , he wore the same dust-covered brown shoes he had while electioneering . They were married on a Friday , and Ford took his bride to a football game the next afternoon in Ann Arbor . That night they attended a Republican reception for Thomas E. Dewey , then the G.O.P. candidate for president , in Dewey 's hometown , Owosso , Michigan . And later that night they began a thirty-six-hour honeymoon in a Detroit hotel , before rushing back to Grand Rapids on Monday morning so Jerry could campaign some more . According to Jerry terHorst 's biography of Ford , before she married Ford , Betty once sounded out the young candidate 's campaign manager for an opinion of her fiance . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that politics will come first and your marriage second , if you can live with that , then I think you 'll have a good marriage . You 'll make a good team in Washington . " Betty Ford said later that until she met Jerry Ford , she never thought she would ever marry again . Though Jerry and Betty Ford had drawn up a private contract before their marriage , one which specified they would have four children , not try to change each other , and some other objectives , Ford 's strong interest in political life took him away from wife and children . Betty was a good sport for many years , working in his campaigns and doing her duty at Republican women 's functions . As the years went on , Ford 's ambition was to become Speaker of the House of Representatives . This meant that he was a willing stumper for Republican candidates  --  the hope being that if they were elected , the House would become Republican and Ford would become Speaker . Betty Ford increased her political schedule too . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my duty to get the Republican wives out and make them active . They were much too quiet and reserved . " Life in Alexandria , Virginia was comfortable in the four-bedroom house they bought for $34,000 in 1955 ( a swimming pool was added in 1961 ) . During Christmas holidays , the family skied at Vail , though Betty had to stop after the trouble with the pinched nerve . But the Fords never accumulated money , and the Speakership became the prime professional goal . Ford believed that goal would be attained in 1972 , when the polls showed President Richard Nixon far ahead of Senator George McGovern . But the voters were contrary , and the Republicans picked up only a few seats in the House . Betty and Congressman Ford decided that his political career would end in 1976 , and he later told newsmen that he took " an oath in blood " to keep his word with his wife . The entire family looked forward to the day . Then , barn , Ford suddenly became Vice-President in October , 1973 , when Spiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " have Jerry to myself for a few years after 1976 " was now in question . And sure enough , less than one year later , Vice-President Gerald Ford became President Ford . The vice-presidency and presidency did liberate certain impulses of Betty 's . She felt freer to express herself . make her own decisions . When President Nixon and her husband were away at the time when Mrs. Martin Luther King , Sr. , was killed , Betty Ford took it on herself to attend the funeral on behalf of the administration . And she began what is now a series of remarkably candid statements about life and morals . " When somebody asks you how you stand on an issue , " she said last year , " you 're very foolish if you try to beat around the bush  --  you just meet yourself going around the bush the other way . But when I disagree with Jerry , I wo n't embarrass him by opposing his policies in public . I 'll do it in the privacy of our sitting room . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even discreet not to say much in defense of former President Nixon and his family . Betty Ford has always spoken well of the Nixons , and regarded Pat Nixon as " a warm and sincere human being who really has the art of putting people at ease . " When Woodward-Bernstein 's The Final Days was published in part in Newsweek , and later , in book form , Mrs. Ford said : " I did n't read the book or the Newsweek articles . I read about it in the newspapers , and I felt that it was all rather unnecessary . I think that a lot of it was gotten third-hand . I do n't think it can be officially documented . I think the press sometimes goes too far . I feel there is a certain amount of privacy that a public figure should be allowed . " But there is little about Betty Ford that escapes the public prints . We know that President Ford chastises her for her chronic tardiness . We know that she is a late riser , that she let him make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives him a " hard time " when she disagrees with him on issues . She laughs at her problem of getting all the food on the table for a dinner party . " When they put me in a casket , " she once said , " they 'll put a ribbon across it saying , ' When will dinner be ready ? ' " In fact , Betty Ford 's White House will never be awarded prizes for gourmet cuisine . Stuffed pepper outdistances capon on the menu . She has even stopped by McDonald 's for a hamburger . In fact , a look at the " First Family Dinner Menu " for two weeks , picked at random , shows lamb chops , lasagna casserole , Egg Foo Yung , broiled hamburgers , fried chicken , meat loaf and pepper steak . Yes , roast capon makes it and so does rib roast on occasions . There is a notable absence of French language on these menus . " We have a very casual White House , " Mrs. Ford says . " We bring all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we like casseroles , so they 're on the menu along with meatballs and corned beef and cabbage . " To me , the servants here are like friends .

If I have clippings or photos of them , I walk into the kitchen and show them to the staff . " They do n't overstep by becoming too friendly . They understand . When they bring my tea in the morning , they chat , talk about the weather , and how it 's bad for sinuses . They are like my neighbors used to be . " Betty Ford does not have 100 percent health . The chemotherapy she still receives , the Valium , and the trying schedule often leave her weak . Her weight , which was 130 before her mastectomy , has dropped to 108 . There are moments , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashen , and she grips a chair or someone 's arm for support . One of her friends , Peggy Whyte , observes : " She is fragile and nobody should expect her to have the stamina of an Eleanor Roosevelt . " Betty Ford loves the life she is living now , though her health can sap that enjoyment sometimes . She seems to be taking the advice of Alice Roosevelt Longworth , who wrote Susan Ford : " Have a helluva good time . " Betty Ford herself would be happy in or out of the White House , and once told me with some fatalism in her soft voice , " I do n't expect to go on forever . "
