Covering a crisis like last week 's blackout in New York is a special challenge for newsmen-particularly when they themselves are affected by the emergency . When the lights went off and the elevators stopped moving at 9:34 Wednesday night , a few staff members were still in the Time-Life Building in midtown Manhattan . Some stayed on through the night , finishing stories by emergency lighting ; others walked down as many as 26 flights of stairs to the dark , crowded street below . Among those in the building was New York Bureau Chief Laurence Barrett , who immediately began phoning correspondents to deploy them around the city : John Tompkins to the power company 's headquarters , James Willwerth to city hall . Other staffers caught by the blackout at home , in restaurants and in theaters also began to interview people and record events . " Everyone had a very individual response , " says Correspondent Eileen Shields , who covered police headquarters that night . " I was walking up the stairs to my apartment when the lights went out . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was happening to everyone . " <P> As crime swelled in some neighborhoods , our correspondents and photographers moved in to follow the battle between police and looters . Observed Correspondent Mary Cronin : " There was a carnival atmosphere . Downtown they were getting drunk and directing traffic . Uptown they were getting drunk and shopping without money . " Said Reporter-Researcher Paul Witteman , who covered the bloody scene in Brooklyn : " It was a tragedy in one act . " <P> To write their reports , the correspondents returned on Thursday to the officially closed , eerily deserted Time-Life Building , where a skeleton staff was working without air conditioning or normal lighting . An emergency generator installed after the ' 65 blackout was used to run one elevator and the telex machines . Among those on hand were Associate Editor Frank Merrick , who wrote our cover story , and Associate Editor Frederic Golden , who wrote an accompanying article on why it all happened . The senior editors for the whole project were Marshall Loeb and Ronald Kriss . Says Kriss , who wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' 65 blackout : " The ' 65 blackout was a lark . This one was more like the ' 64 riots-a disaster . "
