Most Americans still think of urban blight in terms of immediate effects : filth , smoke and noise that all can see , smell and hear . But dirty cities affect far more than the people in them ; they also poison the distant countryside-as Los Angeles is now doing to the San Bernardino National Forest , which is fully 80 miles away . <P> Swept east by wind , the city 's smog is killing the forest 's majestic ponderosa pines at the rate of 3% a year . Incense cedar and white fir have also suffered . In all , the smog has caused moderate to severe damage in 60% of the forest 's 160,000 acres of pines . Last week loggers began cutting down dead trees in the hardest hit 1,000 acres . <P> U.S. Forest Service officials first began to notice a peculiar yellowing of needles on on the the San Bernardino trees in the 1950s . Not until the early 1960s was the cause of the disease traced to smog . " Photosynthesis is inhibited almost immediately , " says Paul Miller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In controlled experiments , smog concentrations of as little as .15 ppm. caused a 20% inhibition of photosynthesis within 60 days . The reality is grimmer . On hot summer days , the smog level in the San Bernardino forest can reach .5 ppm . The average is .20 to .25 - enough to reduce photosynthesis by 66% . In turn , this impedes the flow of protective pitch with in the tree , allowing pests to attack its trunk with near impunity . <P> Present plans call for selling diseased ponderosas to lumber companies and replacing them with nearly 70,000 giant Sequoia and sugar pine trees , which are thought to be more resistant to smog . Meantime , the smog rolls on , doubtless affecting the forest in other ways that are not yet known .
