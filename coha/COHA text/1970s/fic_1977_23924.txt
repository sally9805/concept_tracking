LOVE IS BLIND A story by Julie Hecht LTHOUGH I LOVE my husband , I see now that he has genes that should never be reproduced  --  that is , genes which must not be allowed to mingle with Me . It would du no real harm if they repro-iced with someone else 's and another unsightperson walked the earth with the hordes alady here , but I could not bear to see a child mine turning into the physical specimen I tow it would become . When I married I never thought much about nes . I was n't interested in reproducing . I is interested in love and in laughing and I Jught a person to marry could be chosen with ly that in mind . Being a young woman of r times , even before it had been publicly detred what our times were , I had no desire to Awe a child . I thought that I might , at some to in the future , after I 'd achieved great suc- is in my work , but still I did not dwell on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vas true  --  genetic inheritance . I did learn all nit it in high-school biology , but I thought meant mostly things like blue eyes , brown s , regular earlobes , or the kind that were ek flat on the side to the skin . We each had make a chart on giant oak tag demonstratsome law of genetic inheritance . I thought i.d a good idea for a chart of eyes , only eyes , es and browns , and hazel , of course , but it i n't chosen as one of the best . Someone did hart of sweet peas , Mendel 's Law of Sweet es , but I never really understood what it int . Mendes Law of Selection . n grade school I had a best friend who was y short , the shortest in the class . I chose for that reason . I spotted her the first day cindergarten in another class . She was at the front of the line because they lined people up in order of shortest to tallest , and I wanted to know her so badly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tallest , and being short seemed so wonderful . When we were put into the same first grade and this tiny girl with very short straight black hair liked me as much as I liked her , I could n't believe my good fortune . I did n't think that if you wished for something so hard you could just get it . One day when we were in fifth grade we were walking down the school stairway together , and our two teachers were walking behind us . One said , " Just look at the difference between those two . " The other one said , " Genes , my dear , genes . " My little friend pinched me and giggled and said , " Genes , did you hear that , they said , genes ' ! " " Well , so what ? " I asked . " Do n't you know what genes are ? They have to do with sex . They come out in the sex act . It 's like a dirty word . " I USED TO THINK that if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coincidence or else a mysterious magical accident . When people saw me with my parents for the first time they would always say , " She does n't look like either one of you , " or " There 's no resemblance at all . " " Where did she get the blond hair ? " they would sometimes ask my black-haired father and my brown-haired mother . " David was very blond as a child , " my mother or my father 's sister would say . I knew that did n't bode well for my future as a blond-haired person , and when I was a little girl I was glad . Since people were constantly remark-ing with astonishment at the blondness , I thought it was something bad . There was an old Russian Jew who sat outside his apartment on Rogers Avenue in a chair in the sun , and every time I went by he would smile and say , " Oh , Blondishka ! Blondishka ! " I hated the way that sounded , and whenever I got a chance at the wishbone I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother asked me what I was wishing for , and when I told her she laughed with surprise . - Do n't you know that most little girls wish they had blond hair ? " " No , " I said . " Why do they wish that ? " " Because blond hair is the beautiful color , " she said . " Almost everybody has brown hair . " My mother was so involved with my blondness that when I was nine she started putting lemon juice in the shampoo rinse water , and when I was eleven she began to add a capful of peroxide as well . Now that I 've grown into the kind of young woman who wants to be natural and look natural and leave myself alone , I am still pouring things into my hair to keep it blond . I must be blond . I owe it to everyone , including myself . I told my dark-haired older sister a few years ago that I was going to just let it grow out to drab light brown and she said in a stricken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your blond ! " My sister had always hated me for having blond hair , and when we were children she tormented me by saying it was green . not blond . Medium-blond hair does have a greenish tint in some lights , but I was too young to understand that . " It 's green , it 's green ! " she would yell , " It 's really green , it 's not blond ! " When I saw she had grown to accept it I could n't give it up . The truth is that she probably likes to tell everybody that I am the kind of person who has bleached hair . ) Yes , I bleach , tweeze , pluck , or cut every hair anywhere visible on my face or body if it is not blond . And that 's because there are some terrible , coarse black-haired genes in my body . One of my father 's sisters has blue-white skin and thick , wiry , black hair , and when I was little I noticed that she had millions of tiny black bristles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fair blond self with this creature who was my aunt , but in my twenties some dreaded black-haired gene made itself apparent and has been fighting to become the victor in battle with the blond ones . My white-blond hair is gone now , and so is all my fatness that I came with as an infant . At nine pounds and eight ounces I weighed more than any baby we had all known . It was often mentioned and I thought it was supposed to be something good  --  I mean people were always impressed and said , " Oh , my God , " or " Wow ! " and could never outdo the weight with any they knew . One day my sister told me ski had read about a baby who weighed ten-and-a half pounds . I felt sick and disappointed . I real ly thought I was the biggest baby ever born When my sister saw how I felt she took a kind ly turn and said , " But I saw its picture any you would n't have wanted to look like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erywhere . It was really ugly , just flab and fah not even like skin . " I could picture the baby and I felt better because not only was I th biggest baby but I was also the best looking All my mother 's neighbors who liked to sa their own baby was the most beautiful free admitted that I was . One told me , " Barry w so beautiful when he was born , no wrinkles , n red squashy face , he was the most beautifh baby I have ever seen , with one exception . Yc were more beautiful . " It 's been hard for me to conrie out that babyhood into what I am now . I mean n eyes are n't even blue anymore . Thank Gc they 're not brown , but what can I do , they ' green , green with yellow around the pupil , n even true clear green . As far as I 'm concerne all eyes must be blue . I guess I 'm a little Iii Hitler in that respect . " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . guess cause my father 's eyes were brown . WI , what color do you have ? " she asked . Imagir my own mother does n't even know what col eyes her kids have . I guess she was trying express hostility by showing me that . W ELL , OF COURSE I am married a blue-eyed man . And all t men I have really loved have h blue eyes , including John F. KI nedy . One bad thing about Jacqueline Kenne is her brown eyes . But she can get away w it ; if she could n't I 'm sure she 'd have the changed  --  I mean , if she could . I admit I In had one or two brown-eyed boyfriends , bu never really loved them . And I was constan disappointed by their eyes . The one I am this ing of now looked like a dog , a hideous d a monstrous ugly animal . His eyes were : simply brown , they were black . There hardly any difference in color between the and the pupil . Sometimes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my college d mitory came up to me and said , " Are you ing out with Arnold Milton ? " and whet said yes , she said sincerely , " He 's the ugl person I 've ever seen . " I was shocked beca she was not a mean person and had a boyfri , of her own , but I knew it was just the pl obvious truth that drove her to say it . I nit one 's spontaneous feeling at seeing him Ugh . " He wrote a story which was published the school magazine , and it was a rather isgusting story about a repulsive man and ime very nauseating things the man did . ater on , a boy I knew said to me , " How could m go with someone as ugly as Arnold Mil-in ? When he wrote that story I thought they iould have published his picture right next it . " I had to say , " I know what you mean . " Before I married my husband , I was in love ith a boy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not my preferred pe . His hair was curly , and he fought his itred of it . Although he knew curls interred with his ideal of perfect looks , he did n't : e to dwell on his own good looks . He mted to be rough and tough and manly , and s eyes twitched and blinked when he was . nfronted with the question of his handsome.ss . Yet this sparkling blue-eyed , fair-skinned , sy-cheeked , tall , lean , muscular fellow had a ther who was a little , ugly , fat , bald Jewish m . Still , I never associated the two genetilly . ( His mother was already dead , but he timed she had not been a beauty . i Both of brothers looked like their father , but I it assumed he was separate from them , and child would look just like him . Not that I as at all interested in having his child . but was eager for one himself so I got a chance imagine its face pretty often . I could never irry a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm always being called - s. my husband 's name or even Miss or Ms. husband 's name by people who just can not tsp the concept . Last year a seventy-eightir-old doctor of national fame said to me , " If are married , how can that possibly be ? " tat could I say ? Why has n't he heard ? He : ed my occupation , and I said , " Actress . " mid he have called Uta Hagen Mrs. Berg ' ? He was angry that day because doctors re sending him women to examine who had ? fectly normal breasts . " Including you , I e seen four women this morning who have hing wrong with their breasts . Doctors do n't ) w what they 're doing . They do n't know at a normal breast is because they 've never n taught . Never let a gynecologist examine it breasts , " he said . " They do n't even know v. " I do know he believes in breast-feeding , I wanted to tell him that I agreed with and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was probably disgusted that I was nearly ty years old and had n't had one yet . I was Lid he 'd ask me why , and then I 'd men-L my career , and he 'd scowl at that , and that would be left would be for me to that I could n't bear to reproduce my husd 's genes . w HEN I FIRST laid eyes on my husband I knew he was n't for me . He was six feet tall , but he did n't seem to be . In any case I require a height of six feet and two inches . He seemed shorter because his arms were not long enough , and his hands were just plain small . My hands are bigger than his , and my fingers are much longer , even though I am only five foot eight . Although he had a long waist and torso , his legs were too short and his head was too close to his body . He was kind of hunched over , partly from bad posture but mostly from leaning forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette smoking almost more than anything , and when I meet a person who smokes I hate the person immediately . Why did I bother with him is something I have to ask myself . I guess because he smoked with fear instead of pleasure or desire . He smoked out of desperation and nervousness even though he was dressed in just the right Ivy League clothes . Sloppy and old , as if he did n't even know he got them all at Brooks Brothers . I suppose I was nervous too . I was probably so nervous I did n't take it in that he was smoking . Oddly enough , it was my husband 's mother and father who got me to realize the importance of genetic inheritance . They were both so concerned that any of their children should marry a person genetically inferior . When they first began to speak of this problem I just figured they were both slightly nuts . What I did n't see at the time were their own incredibly lousy genes . I mean , when I first viewed my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked over by a plastic surgeon , but I did n't trouble to wonder what nose it had been before . The sides above the nostrils were obviously chiseled away and thinned out , then pinched hard together and twisted too much to one side before the nose could set , so that it set crooked , and then a point was made at the tip with a small line in the middle to make it more realistic . My husband denied that his mother had had this surgery , and I believed him because he 's such an honest person . Then I saw his sister , and I noticed that the space from the top of her lip to the bottom of her nose was a large space and also kind of fat and puffy-looking , too large and fat for the average-size nose sitting above it . After that , I realized that the nostrils were thicker and larger than the top of the nose . In other words , things were all out of proportion up there . My husband freely admitted to that surgery because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother 's had occurred before he was born . In any case , now we have no way of " I admit I have had one or two brown-eyed boyfriends , but I never really loved them . And I was constantly disappointed by their eyes . " knowing what fat nose is floating around in his genes . " What was your nose like , Mom ? " he asked , " Like mine ? " " Umm , yes , " she said , but I could tell by the way her voice went up when she said , " Umm , " that she was lying . She would have liked for it to have been like his , but it was obviously worse . I 'm not going to mix up my long , thin , pointy nose with their coarse genes . It 's out of the question . My husband weighs only about ten pounds more than he should , but two of those pounds arc on his face in the form of fat puffy jowls and a double chin . Usually a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overweight . I ca n't understand it . " Heredity , " his father has said . " It 's those Andrews jowls . " Then he laughs in a mean way . He does n't like his wife 's foul genes any better than I do , and he says it right in front of her . I love when this happens . It makes her feel really bad because she is always going around criticizing genes , and she has the worst ones . Ha ! Once , when he looked at my husband 's sickly pallor , he said . " The sallow Andrews skin . " He shook his head and smiled when he said it too . When I first saw my husband 's mother I thought she was rather pretty and that her sallow , flabby jowls were a result of had living habits , overeating , a high-fat diet , lack of exercise , and late middle age . Then I began to realize that her son 's face was a younger version of the same shape and texture . Dear God , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a double chin ? I hate fat so much , an ounce of soft fat is a despicable thing to me , especially on the face , where it must be viewed constantly , in its soft yellow greenness . Since I dislike this flab so much on my husband 's mother and I love my husband so much , one day when I was looking at his chins and jowls from profile I said to myself , " This is the same exact thing she has , this is her , her face is his , his face is hers , is it so bad ? " Very quickly I felt a tremendous fierce urge to punch him in the face . A hard savage blow to destroy the whole area . Last night he looked so sad I leaned over and gave him a kiss on his soft cheek , and before I knew it I was taking a bite out of it . He thought it was a bite of passion , when in fact I wanted to tear it off with my teeth . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck at all . I used to think he had a thick muscular neck , but it took me six years to see that it was one inch long . One day I went over and looked at his shirt collar . I found I could n't get a fingertip inside . It was tight as could be , with his thick ' neck jammed into it and his chin and jowls squeezed up and hanging down over his tie knot . " Is n't that uncomfortable ? " I asked him . " I thought that 's how they were suppose ( to be , " he said . As soon as possible , I confronted his mothe : with the fatness of her son 's neck . It was dom with subtlety , but the results were very grand She was sick about it . Apparently she 's alway known the facts but has simply lied to hersel about the entire situation , the way she doe with anything about her family she doesn ' like . " But his father wears a fifteen , " she saio in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck , " said his father . " He 's almost exactly Murray 's size . " " He 's shorter and stockier , " I said . " The Andrews thick neck , " Murray sal . with a smirk . " He takes after the Ogdens more than th Andrews . " insisted Pearl . " He looks just like you , " I said to her . This is something she ca n't bear to admi A friend of mine told me that at our weddin she said to Pearl , " Your son looks just lik you , " and Pearl said , " Oh , no , you 'll see whe you meet his father that he looks much mot like him . " This is the kind of statement an ii sane person makes , like " I 'm George Washim ton , not Mary Blake . " For in her heart my hu band 's mother knows she is a very bad thing i many ways , and she tried to marry and cane herself out , but it did n't work , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stout , she married someone tall and thi but her bad short genes kept her son down . Before we were married , I had heard fro everyone how good-looking my husband 's f ther was , but I did n't pay much attention b cause I have n't found people 's fathers attra tive since I was a child . Older men are of interest to me whatsoever . If anything , I li ! teen-age boys , but that 's nothing bad , bccau I began liking them when I was a teen-ager , it 's just a natural thing . I certainly was st prised when I met him . He was my most a mired type , tall and thin with very long , ni row legs . He did n't have all his hair , and he had was white , so I could n't feel persona attracted to him , but I knew he was a ve handsome man . He looks a lot like Gary Co ( er , but not that really great as the young Ga Cooper . and he also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original loni nose before his car accident . Anyway , I v so stunned by his good looks that when husband 's mother said , " Well , what did y think of Harley 's father ? " I simply said , " H so good-looking ! " I guess I said it with a of honest enthusiasm too . She was pleased about that , but she had say , " Like father , like son , " to which I s nothing in reply . Well , we were n't eye to the moment . I was busy wrapping a pack- ; e and she was looking at me sidewards . " W-e-e-e-1 , do n't you think Harley is gor.ous-looking too ? " she persisted . First of all , that adjective to describe the oks of a person , especially a male person , nnot be tolerated . Those who use it are of a mmon type . They know who they are , I know to they are . All I could say was , He looks mpletely different from his father . " f HERE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body resembles that of a pigeon . She was miserable on that day and did n't try to conceal r feelings , but that did n't have much to do th it . It 's just that because she has no neck , r face seems to come straight out of her . st , and in constantly trying to look less 3rt she is always turning her face upward , it appears to be connected to her body only a hinge , nothing more . From there down , problem is complicated by her shape , ich is much like those little wooden eggtped Russian peasant dolls , the ones that ne in eight graduated sizes , each fitting into next , so that before you pick it up you nk there 's just one , not seven more inside . Pearl , there 's the large bosom which goes o the bloated middle , all in one curve bee tapering off into the straight legs and 7k ankles . He probably does have a sixteen neck , " I Murray . " He has my torso from the ulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttocks and narrow hips , but got those short , muscular thighs from his ther 's side , his legs are shorter and more scular than mine , and his arms are shorter 1 thicker too . " He demonstrated with his Id on his own body as he spoke , much the Julia Child does when she shows on her i body which part of the cow is which cut neat . I was a vegetarian long before I saw do that . ' earl was unhappy with Murray 's depiction ler son 's physical attributes , partly because he unfortunate facts of her son 's body , and : ly because she was responsible for all the ones . Oh , I loved the scene . When Murray my husband in his bathing trunks one rner. he said with a twisted smile . " Those Andrews thighs . " All along I had thought ? were just muscular . After we were living atter I saw him naked a lot , and from the c I realized that each huge thigh was alt twice the size of the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , still , it is a freakish sight . His poor sister has the long Ogden thighs and the thick Andrews calves and ankles , but she takes it lightly . " Someone told me that if this part of my ankle were cut away , I would have good legs , " she showed me , pointing to the whole back section of her ankle , a thick stump . " And the calf too , " I added . I 'm surely not going to mix around with my husband 's family 's legs . They 're peasants , 1 guess  --  his mother , anyway . They look like wooden legs made just to serve a purpose without a thought to aesthetics at all . My husband 's feet are so wide that it 's a real chore to put his socks on . Sometimes when I 'm begging him to go out and he 's watching sonic sports event on TV he says , " Okay , get my socks and shoes and put them on me . " The time I took him up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost ten times the size of the sock top where the foot enters first . I opened the sock up and started slipping it on , but I saw right away that a different method would be necessary . The sock has to be pulled open forcefully with both hands . then very gradually inched down bit by bit until the toes get into the foot part of the sock . The whole way through the ankle part and through the heel is a struggle . When I said , " Your feet are so wide , how do you get socks on them ? " he smiled and spread his toes out even wider . It was an unbelievable sight . Then he grabbed the sock from me and pulled it on himself . To his credit I will say that the skin is very soft and satiny , and when I put my foot on his under the blankets it does n't even feel like a foot . I mean I can really get my foot onto the whole thing , like a skateboard . Yes , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sallow skin . I always think it 's from eating so much butter and lots of rich fatty food , especially animal fats . Surely they 've heard how bad that is , but they stubbornly disregard the evidence . In the days when I was still willing to cook meat for him , as if he were some wild beast who required it from his jungle habitat , 1 carefully cut all the fat off his lamb chops . One night it was in a neat pile on the plate , and he grabbed it and ate it up . A person who cats fat  --  well , what is such a person ? The next man 1 marry will eat no fat . Instinctively I know fat is inedible . Even as a child , when I was bribed to eat lamb-chop meat without knowing it was from a little lamb , every bit of fat " tad to be removed . My family has always found this amusing , except for my father , who agrees with me and tried to forbid the eating of even chicken skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here , crispy skin , " she would offer my sister  --  and did n't I just read some restaurant reviewer 's acclaim " When I first laid eyes on my husband I knew he was n't for me . He was six feet tall , but he did n't seem to be . " of an entire dish of " crisp duck skin " in a Chinese restaurant ? Oh , yes , it 's a mad piggy world , and people love to eat pigs best of all . You could never get them to tell you just why the Jews wo n't eat pigs . Some tried to claim it was because pigs are dirty , meaning that they roll around in mud and eat garbage . The truth is that they eat sewage . I read an article about some place in South America where the country people would n't eat pork because they had pigs around and knew what they were like , but the city people loved pork because they never saw how pigs lived . When I read that I understood the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't face saying . My husband and his mother and sisters all eat pork and pork fat and chicken and chicken fat and beef and beef fat and any animal and its fat they can get hold of . They 're all four puffed up and out with the fat of animals , and their skin has a soft , fatty glow and slippery soft touch . Sun does not harm this skin . They use no lotions but get browner and browner like those turkeys that come with extra oil and fat shot under their skin  --  self-basting , they call them . My relations must all stay in the shade . Our skin is white and thin , except for my mother , who has a lot of what she calls " ruddiness . " She claims to have had a perfect English complexion as a young woman even though she 's of Russian descent . Although my sister and I never had bad skin it was n't exquisite , and my mother used to look at us and say , " What 's wrong with you girls ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . " I do n't know why she ruined it with years on the beach then . She told me that once she and a friend got so dark they were refused entry at a hotel that barred Negroes . I 've tried to be careful but just from being outside in the summers my skin is covered with tiny crack marks everywhere . There 's just not enough fat in it to keep it from cracking in the sun . Each summer I see our family 's skin getting drier and more shriveled while my husband 's gets juicier and juicier . When my mother sees him after our summer vacation she says , " You got Indian in your blood or somethin ' ? " If she 's feeling less restrained she 'll say , " You must got nigger blood in you . " Since I began dwelling on my husband 's family genes I 've begun to consider having someone else 's baby . I know that these things happen on soap operas , but they 're always accidents . I was trying to imagine one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering for the same reasons . I guess it 's too sick to be on TV . Too realistic also . Characters often detest their in-laws on these programs , but they never think about their hus band or baby being from the same stock . 1 guess it 's too horrible to face . They struggh around for years to find the right person to low who loves them back , and then they discover the mother is a beast . These characters all low their lovers so much and so hard that they 'll always looking at one another intensely am falling into an embrace . That 's where I wouldn ' fit in , because when I love my husband a lot look hard at him and see his mother . I can ' get it off my mind . When I hug him I want ti punch his short arms . I want to pinch hi double chins . I want to stretch his fat neck .

A sweet , honest pe son should not be tricked , and , after all , Ii knows that I despise his genes . It shouldn come as too much of a surprise to him . Bi when I do broach the subject he seems to thin it 's just my way of being mean .
