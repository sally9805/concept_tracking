txt Folks on a postal route in Council Bluffs , Iowa , were surprised one day last month to find their mail being delivered by their congressman . Two days later , patients at a veterans ' hospital in Des Moines were equally astonished to discover the same Honorable Gentleman toiling as a nurse 's aide . Congressional moonlighting ? No , just Rep. Thomas R. Harkin putting in his " workdays " back home ? only one of a trunkful of new ideas ? either fresh or half-baked , depending on your point of view ? which the 91 freshmen senators and representatives have brought with them to Washington . The freshman Democrat logged 25 " workdays " during his election campaign last year ? including one-day flings at quarrying limestone in Logan , bailing hay in Cass County , riveting truck bodies in Council Bluffs , and keeping house in suburban Greenfield . An aide reckons it 's " 40 percent of why he got elected " in this bastion of grain-belt Republicanism . " One of our major problems today is that Representatives in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harkin says . " You ca n't really represent people unless you know what they 're going through in their daily lives . " A sample of other ideas : ? Pocket paintbrush . Elected to Congress as a housepainter , Rep. Edward P. Beard ( D ) of Rhode Island carries a paintbrush in his breast pocket so he wo n't forget his unpretentious origins . It 's there to remind him , he says , " if I ever get carried away with myself ? because my salary will triple ? that I 'm a workingman . " After all , he has a reputation to uphold : This high school dropout , former window washer and ex-shoeshine boy is the only bona fide laborer in Congress . ? Permanent open door . His winning campaign slogan had been " open government hinges on your vote " ; so Sen. Richard B. Stone ( D ) of Florida has taken the door to his private office right off its hinges . Literally nothing goes on behind closed doors . // * Fresh breezes in Congress // " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense or security , " he explains . And that includes the caucuses of his own party colleagues , which he boycotts . Voluntary pay cut . Vowing that inflation fighting begins with his own paycheck , Rep. Larry L. Pressler ( R ) of South Dakota has docked himself a 10 percent pay cut ( $4,250 of his annual congressional salary of $42,500 ) . The only hitch is that the federal Treasury wo n't take it back . So he is giving it to his home state , where ; he retorts , it will be " more efficiently spent " anyway . ? Free phone . Constituents across the 140-mile length of Indiana 's Second Congressional District ? from the industrialized Lake Michigan shoreline near Chicago to rural Tippecanoe in mid-state ? and telephone the local office of Rep. Floyd J. Fithian for free . And more than 50 do so daily , with everything from questions about their social security to advice on world problems . The Democratic lawmaker is the only one in the country to offer voters a free , area-code-800 phone number . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the more I can respond to their wishes . " ? Pastel walls . Federal bureaucrats told Rep. Gladys N. Spellman ( D ) of Maryland that they would paint her Capitol Hill office any color she wishes ? so long as it was either cream , beige , tan , light green , or light blue . Her taste offended , she bolted out and brought canary yellow and dusky cantaloupe , only to learn that the government painters would n't apply it . So her staff did the job themselves . Next goal : a cheery red carpet .
