 | How Hard Should You Work ? @# How HARD should you work ? The obvious answer is another question : what do you want from life ? But even that is n't the whole answer . Some people labor long and diligently , never making progress , while others seem to coast along in their jobs , reaping promotions and raises . Still others achieve success by working so hard that they sacrifice leisure , family life and sometimes sanity . The work ethic is fundamental to American culture , having arrived with the Pilgrims . Thus , in the 1950s and 1960s , it was fashionable to fret about how Americans would cope with their added leisure when automation reduced the workweek to three or four days . But as productivity rose , Americans chose added spending power over more free time . Since 1950 real per-capita income has increased by some 75 percent , while the number of hours in the average workweek has declined only slightly . It was also fashionable in the 1960s for businessmen to fume about the demise of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death were greatly exaggerated . Opinion polls taken between 1968 and 1971 by Daniel Yankelovich , Inc. , found college students perfectly willing to work hard at a job ? if it paid off in such intangibles as challenge ' and opportunity for selfexpression . A confident and wellheeled generation had grown up to value psychic rewards more than @#  | monetary ones ; the work ethic had thus changed only in that young people refused to work hard at jobs they did n't like in order to make money they did n't need . Today , people who want to get ahead still find that they must work longer than average hours . Bolting for the door at five o'clock can keep you in a low-paying job . One midwestern personnel administrator says he figures that when an employe reaches a salary level of $20,000 to $25,000 , he loses the right to grouse about having to work late or take work home . According to the Department of Labor , 17 percent of all white-collar managers and self-employed businessmen work 6o hours or more a week . ( Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work also depends , of course , on how well organized you are . Studies have shown that executives who have reached the same level within a single company often work widely varying numbers of hours . Accountants or office managers , for instance , tend to work shorter hours than those executives whose duties are not so well defined and whose contributions are harder to pin down . Most personnel professionals concede that women must work harder to succeed than their male counterparts do . Female workers , no matter how able , tend to play by the rules and to have trouble calling attention to themselves . Regional differences also affect how hard people have to work . The easygoing life-styles of the South and West mean easygoing wor styles , too . John Sibbald , a vice president of Booz , Allen &; Ham ton , a management-consulting fir in Chicago , says New Yorke work more hours and more in. tensely , despite a later start in t morning and a longer lunchtime Just the vexation of commuting i New York compared with other cities makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " get off the train all revv up , " he says , and maintain that f ver pitch all day . But hard work never killed anyone . What does is failure to deal with stress . Moderate amounts of tension keep a job from becoming dull , and most executives are competitive people who thrive on a certain amount of pressure . Too much , however , can exact a toll . Doctors link such ailments as ulcers , colitis , headaches , backaches and heart attacks to stress , and suspect that it is also involved in such diseases as cancer , diabetes and arthritis . A person who has been promoted to a job that is beyond his ability is under particular strain . Dr. Harry Johnson , chairman of the medial board at the Life Extension Institute , points out that tension " stems from within the person and not from without . Jobs are never tense ; people are . " Overwork can lead to inefficiency . Some people work too hard because they wo n't delegate responsibilities . Their insecurities compel them to  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't distinguish between being busy and being productive . They are human windmills , flailing at work , but actually accomplishing little . Some sophisticated employers are wary of hiring such compulsive " workaholics , " who tend to be inflexible and shortsighted . While some pressure is inevitable , the stereotype of the ulcer-ridden executive is misleading . People who are happy in their work , whatever the pressure , tend to be healthy . Executives tend to get healthier as they Advance . Middle managers , with lots of responsibility and little authority , Are buffeted by stress . Top executives , who have emerged from the fracas as victors , have relatively low rites of heart attack and suicide . Does success justify burning the andle at both ends ? It 's up to you . Some people drop out of the running for better jobs and more money , consciously deciding they do n't want the bother . Some settle in industries with a reputation for being more hospitable to the unambitious than most . Fields where nearly all important decisions are made at the top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the middle-management ranks , according to one personnel ; administrator . In corporations , hospitable or not , people without strong ambition tend to lodge in what Pearl Meyer , senior vice president of the New York management-consulting firm of Handy Associates , calls " the traditional stopping places " in middle management . They tend to be paper shufflers , not decision makers . Their bosses are content as long as they do competent work . They are , however , vulnerable in a merger or a recession . Dorsey Davidoff , a 42-year-old inventor and electrical engineer of Fort Lee , N.J. , left the corporate environment altogether in 1961 so that he could be his own man . Although his time is worth as much as $25 an hour to companies that employ him on a free-lance basis , he earned just $15,000 last year because he elected to work only six months . " Having money , but not having time to do what you enjoy , is n't getting you what you really want , " he says . Davidoff has toured Europe numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , and recently spent a summer on a kibbutz in Israel . In the end , the question of how hard you should work boils down to fundamental philosophical choices about the way you want to live . How big a family , mortgage or ego do you have to support ? Whatever the answer , it 's not how many hours you put in but how you use your time on the job that is of prime importance . Here are some ways of making the most of that time : ? Concentrate your energies on the parts of your job that you will be judged by . If you work under deadlines , determine whether it is  | more important to your employer that your work be excellent or on time . If you ca n't do both , you should know how often you can get away with one or the other . ? Allow time to reflect on priorities and long-term goals . Make daily lists of things to do in order of importance . ? Be alert to procrastinating activities , such as constantly tidying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn where you wander off course . ? Work visibly . If you dc more than is expected of you , make sure the boss knows it . ? Avoid unnecessary meetings . Seasoned businessmen cite them as one of the biggest time wastc Really important matters are 1 communicated on paper . ? Discover the time of day yo energy peaks , and arrange yo schedule accordingly . Try arrivi early and getting a leg up on t day 's work instead of working la If you take work home , quit at le . an hour before bedtime to clear yo mind for sleep . Such advice adds up to working intelligently , not hard . You 'll go fit ther by working efficiently , notic ably and with a sense of what pleases the boss than by simply working longer than the next fellow . It 's tho racehorses , not the dray horses , that get ahead . @# It happened 30 years ago this month .

What manager , and what player , would dare cross the barrier of prejudice ? In the selection that follows , the author quotes veteran baseball scout Clyde Sukeforth ( who was the third man in the room ) as he describes a tense confrontation between Branch Rickey , president and general manager of the then Brooklyn Dodgers , and a young black ballplayer named Jackie Robinson . w Baseball Gre Up Condensed from " BASEBALL WHEN THE GRASS WAS REAL " DONALD HONIG N AUGUST 1945 , Mr. Rickey sent me out on an assignment which I guess you might describe as memorable . He called me into his office one day and told me to have a seat . " The Kansas City Monarchs are playing the Lincoln Giants in Chicago on Friday night , " he said . " I want you to see that game . I want you to see that fellow Robinson on Kansas City . Talk to him before the game . Tell him I want to know if he 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole . Ask Robinson to have his coach hit him some balls in the hole . " Mr. Rickey had been talking about establishing a Negro club in New York called the Brooklyn Brown Dodgers , and we had been scouting the Negro leagues for more than a year . But you know , there was always something strange about it . He told us that nobody was supposed to know what we were doing .
