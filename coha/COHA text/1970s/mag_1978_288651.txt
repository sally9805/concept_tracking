A CAPTIVE OF TIME by Olga Ivinskaya Translated by Max Hayward Doubleday ; 462 pages ; $12.50 <P> When Boris Pasternak and Olga Ivinskaya fell in love in 1946 , Stalin was preparing his second assault against the Russian intelligentsia . Ivinskaya became the beleaguered poet 's lifeline . By his own account , she was the inspiration for Lara in his novel Doctor Zhivago . She was his typist , his collaborator on translations and his business manager . While the unworldly poet remained on the sidelines , he delegated her to deal with hostile Soviet bureaucrats and , later , with the foreign publishers of his Nobel-prizewinning novel , banned in the U.S.S.R. <P> Ivinskaya paid cruelly for her 14-year association with Pasternak . In 1949 , after refusing to falsely denounce her lover as a British spy , she was imprisoned for five years . Singularly diabolical torture was inflicted on Ivinskaya , who was pregnant by Pasternak at the time . At one point she was led through interminable prison corridors on the promise of a visit from Pasternak . Instead , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cadavers , she miscarried . Following Pasternak 's death , she was again arrested . This time her tormentors tried to extract a confession that she had written Doctor Zhivago herself . When this tactic proved untenable , she was charged with accepting some of Pasternak 's foreign royalties and sent to a concentration camp for four years . <P> Now 65 and living in Moscow , Ivinskaya has had her intimate recollections of Pasternak published in the West , thus risking the further wrath of the authorities in the Soviet Union . She has also made another , perhaps more portentous choice : to expose the human frailty that is the underlay of heroism and the foolishness that may be attendant upon genius . She tells of her endless " female tantrums , " provoked by Pasternak 's determination not to leave his wife and children but to maintain two households instead . To these outbursts the writer often responded , " this is something out of a bad novel . " " I suppose I longed for recognition and wanted people to envy me , " Ivinskaya explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsparing of Pasternak 's wife Zinaida , who died in 1966 . But she does cite some of Pasternak 's letters to third parties that are full of praise for Zinaida : " I owe my life to her , " the writer declared after a long illness . At times , Ivinskaya tends to confuse art and life . She often asserts that particular lines in Pasternak 's work refer specifically to her . In his overwhelmingly expressive portrait of Lara , Pasternak offered no other physical description of his heroine than a mention of " strong , white , woman 's arms . " Ivinskaya would have been well advised to allow readers to imagine the rest .
