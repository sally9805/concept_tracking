Public debate continued last week over President Ford 's plan for conditional amnesty for Viet Nam War resisters , which he had courageously proposed the week before at the convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars ( TIME , Sept. 2 ) . The whole idea was quickly and predictably denounced as unfair by some conservatives , including the V.F.W. , and berated as inadequate by some of the war resisters themselves , but Ford stuck to his guns . " I have made a decision , " he declared in his press conference , " which I think is right and proper : no unconditional amnesty , no revenge , and ... individuals who have violated the draft laws or have evaded Selective Service or deserted can earn their way or work their way back . " <P> This week , after receiving a set of proposals from Justice Department and Defense Department officials who have been studying the problem , the White House expects to announce the details of the plan . Presumably it will require a war resister to make some sort of statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Peace Corps or VISTA . Attorney General William Saxbe acknowledged last week that the plan will not be welcomed by all of the estimated 50,000 war resisters involved . But the President is determined to " open the door to them , " said Saxbe , adding that the plan " will make it as easy as it can be for them to return-but they are not going to be welcomed back as heroes . " <P> The arguments over how to deal with the war resisters have long ranged , in the President 's words , from amnesty to revenge . Organizations like the V.F.W. , the Marine Corps League and the Non-Commissioned Officers Association have insisted that any form of amnesty would dishonor the 2.5 million men who served in Viet Nam , and would mock the sacrifice of the 55,000 who died there . Advocates of forgiveness have argued that on 34 occasions in U.S. history the Government has granted amnesty to some of its citizens , and should do so again in the case of a war that was regarded by many Americans as immoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with President Ford 's proposal , many Americans regarded it as a constructive step . Stanford Professor Robert McAfee Brown , a Presbyterian pastor who served five days in jail after a 1971 demonstration , called Ford 's plan " a very gutsy thing , " especially since Brown had assumed " the issue was going to be on the back burner for a long time . " <P> Forget the War . Ford 's proposal for conditional forgiveness may be the best solution for a problem that has no perfect answer . It would offer those draft evaders and deserters who want to return a way back into American life without being treated as criminals . At the same time , the Government , which was guilty of widespread deception during the Viet Nam War , would foster much needed post-Watergate reconciliation by showing charity toward its dissenting young men . " The purpose of amnesty is to forget the war and heal the wounds , " says John Kerry , former head of the Viet Nam Veterans Against the War , " and it may be that the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides . My heart and my morality say the resisters should n't have to do anything to come back , but a year of some kind of public service work is something that everyone should do anyway , as a continuation of citizenship .
