President Nixon 's stance on the subject of school desegregation in general and busing in particular has never really been in question . Last year he eased Robert Finch , a close friend who was then Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , out of his job , in part for pressing too hard on integration . Finch 's replacement , Elliot Richardson , has now been left stranded . Last week , moving abruptly to " disavow " HEW 's busing plan for schools in Austin , Texas , Nixon emphatically restated his position : " I have consistently opposed the busing of our nation 's schoolchildren to achieve a racial balance , and I am opposed to the busing of children simply for the sake of busing . Further , while the Executive Branch will continue to enforce the orders of the court , including court-ordered busing , I have instructed the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare that they are to work with individual school districts to hold busing to the minimum required by law . " <P> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts in the South-and North-an official excuse for making little haste very slowly . In the Austin case , U.S. District Judge Jack Roberts had rejected the HEW proposal , which called for extensive busing ; Roberts had opted instead for an alternative advanced by the local school board , which planned only intermittent busing of pupils as a sort of intramural cultural-exchange program . <P> Nixon conceded that the Justice Department would have to appeal Judge Roberts ' decision , because the Supreme Court had upheld the principle of bus ing in a decision last April involving schools in North Carolina , Georgia and Alabama . But , he said , the Government would no longer argue for the HEW plan ; instead , it would seek a compromise . Nixon also instructed Richardson to submit an amendment to prohibit use of funds from his $1.5 billion Emergency School Assistance Act for busing . <P> There was some reason for the Government 's retreat on the Austin busing question ; the HEW plan had some technical weaknesses .

He was informed of the President 's move at the last minute , and carried no personal plea or protest to Nixon . <P> Opinion v. Law . Said Minnesota 's Democratic Senator Walter Mondale , who shepherded the Senate version of the school assistance bill : " I do not think that in the long term this country will reward the President for attempting to pit public opinion against the rule of law announced by the Supreme Court . " In New York , the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Education Fund said that it may intervene in the Austin case in advocacy of the HEW plan . <P> On the other hand , busing opponents - especially in Texas-were displeased that the President chose to have the Justice Department press the appeal at all . Although Nixon was at considerable pains to assure Senator John Tower that the Government would proceed no further than the law absolutely requires , the crusty Texas Republican was not easily appeased .
