txt Genuine independence for Namibia ( South-West Africa ) might be worked out if the black and Colored ( mixed race ) representatives at the constitutional conference here could wrest control of the talks from the whites . But plans to set up a multiracial mterim gov- ernment for the territory will not solve the issue so long as the initiative remains with the ruling white National Party . Also for a viable solution the biggest , black nationalist group , the South-West African People 's Organization ( SWAPO ) , must become involved in the negotiations . Currently SWAPO is excluded from the conference . Reports that contact is soon to be made with the United Nations ? through a trip by several conference delegates to New York ? point toward an attempt by the blacks to take the initiative . Given their political inexperience , the vigor with which the bl'Acks and Coloreds are pushing for immediate independence comes as a surprise . Several basic hypocrisies about the constitutional conference could prove its undoing . One is the myth that South Africa has no power here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part and parcel of the National Party of South Africa , called the conference and is trying to make sure it does not go too far . ( South Africa has held on to the administration of this former German colony in defiance of a UN decision terminating the mandate it was granted by the League of Nations after World War I. The UN has given South Africa until Aug. 31 to withdraw from the territory. ) *Please turn to Pige 9 *Namibia : black power on white terms // A second hypocrisy is the contention by the white delegation that SWAPO can not join the talks because no political parties are allowed . The three white delegates at the talks represent a political party , the National Party . The character of the politicians involved is important in the smal:town atmosphere of this country . The man who is supposed to be the knight in shining armor is Dirk Mudge , a tall , handsome farmer who charms most whites and some blacks . Several blacks have said he is a racist , but most blacks think him more progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been named as the likely prime minister of the interim government , while Chief Clemens Kapuuo of the Herero tribe would be provisional president . There is a leadership problem among the blacks and Coloreds . Chief Kapuuo has been groomed by the whites , but he does not have the grasp of how to lead a country , according to people who have known him for years . By contrast his new legal adviser , Jariretundu Kozongquizi , is considered by blacks and whites to be brilliant . He is " the most objective man , black or white , I have met , " said a white South African journalist . Mr. Kozongquizi , also a Herero , is a qualified London lawyer . Except for him and the American lawyer Stuart Schwartz , the legal advisers to the conference are white South Africans . One man who consistently talks out against apartheid and South Africa is the leader of the Colored delegation , A. J. F. Kloppers . He has had some impact , but the Coloreds represent only 3.8 percent of the population . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be their effort to reject apartheid and South African control if they are to prevent bloodshed . Bryan Olinn of the Federalist Party is aware of the need for change . He told this reporter that he wants as soon as possible to establish a multiracial party . His Federalist Party ( white ) won 30 percent of the vote in the last elections in 1974 , but it did not win any seats in the assembly . Its biggest problem is money , because businessmen are unwilling to displease the South African Government .
