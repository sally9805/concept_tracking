Fats city on Broadway <P> Music everywhere , feet are pattin ' , Puttin ' tempo in old Manhattan . <P> Everybody is out high-hattin ' , Spreadin ' rhythm around . <P> To most people , those are the lyrics of a 1935 Fats Waller song , Spreadin ' Rhythm Around . But to audiences at Broadway 's Longacre Theater , they are official marching orders , a direct command from the feet to the brain . Not since Fats was tapping the keys back in speakeasy days has old Manhattan had such a good high-hattin ' time as it does in Ain ' t Misbehavin ' , a musical collection of 30 songs Waller composed or helped to make famous . To put it mildly , Ai n't Misbehavin ' is behaving wildly . Three days after it opened May 9 , it was sold out through June ; now the house is booked into September . And besides picking up five Tony Award nominations , the show won the New York Drama Critics Award as the year 's best musical , against such high-powered competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dancin ' . <P> Like other recent Broadway hits , including A Chorus Line and Runaways , Ai n't Misbehavin ' started out in the hinterlands-in its case , a cramped boite ( seating 65 ) in the Manhattan Theater Club . But from the first , Director Richard Maltby Jr. , 40 , the Yaleman who put Ai n't Misbehavin ' together , believed that what he had was not just a little revue but a big Broadway show , cut down to cabaret size . Sure enough , he recalls , " after the first three nights , I told the cast they 'd better get ready for something really big . In fact , we had trouble containing the show in a cabaret . This cast can blow the walls down even at the Longacre . " <P> The Joshua of the cast , which consists of three women and two men , is Nell Carter . Her remarkable voice can be as powerful as a trumpet and as plaintive as a flute , and when she sings Mean To Me and It 's a Sin To Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her fellow performers - Armelia McQueen , Ken Page , Andr <P> De Shields , Charlaine Woodard-are equally superb . Indeed , the funniest song in the show is Ken Page 's Your Feet 's Too Big . Sitting alone with a glass of booze at a cafe table , Page yells out at his absent woman , " From your ankles up , I 'll say you sure are sweet. / But from there down , baby , there 's just too much feet . " By the time he gets to the reprise , every foot in the theater is stomping : " Do n't want you ' cause your feet 's too big. / Ca n't use you ' cause your feet 's too big. / I really hate you ' cause your feet 's too big . " <P> Though they seem to have been singing Fats ' songs all their lives , most of the performers knew little about him . When they began rehearsals , they watched old Waller film clips to get in the proper mood . Maltby , the son of Music Arranger Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associate director Murray Horwitz suggested building a show around Waller 's work . They both soon discovered , as Maltby told TIME 'S Janice Castro , that " nobody wedded comedy and music the way Fats did . He is always playing little jokes on the side , and you ca n't help but laugh . "
